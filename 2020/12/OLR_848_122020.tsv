0	13560	Music games are at a pivot as Rock Band was made compatible in Generation 8, but as of
13560	15840	yet there's been no big news for Generation 9.
15840	19920	Meanwhile Konami continues to bring the Bomani Suite to PC with five game releases now available
19920	21280	in Japan.
21280	24200	Music licensing makes releases in the West difficult, but a quick shout out to Taiko
24200	27680	no Tachi-Gen, Groove Coaster, Project Diva, and Kingdom Hearts, Melody of Memory all on
27680	28680	the Switch.
28680	32040	This is the 32nd Music Game Update, it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers,
32040	35000	and Loki with more of this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now
35000	37120	on the show where every gamer has a voice.
37120	44640	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to the weekly show where every
44640	49920	gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio Live.
49920	57000	Once again tonight for episode number 848, December the 20th of 2020.
57000	62680	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me here live every week, I think we may have Dark
62680	68200	Sakura or Jamie Summers who is having tech difficulties for the show, is she there?
68200	70760	Okay she's still not with us, but hopefully will be joining us at some point throughout
70760	76480	the show, she was having some problems with her computer beforehand, so I think she was
76480	80080	trying to reboot or connect from another device or something like that.
80080	83640	So hopefully we'll be hearing from her shortly, but I know joining us tonight, because I can
83640	86840	see him on cam, is Techmaster Loki.
86840	87840	Hello.
87840	89040	Hi Loki, how are you?
89040	90040	I'm doing good.
90040	94240	Good, and I see that you're wearing your new OLR shirt that's available at the VoG Network
94240	96240	Shop, plug plug.
96240	97240	Yes I am.
97240	99040	Yeah, how is it?
99040	100520	It's comfortable.
100520	105840	It's wonderful, it's premium quality, I love it.
105840	113720	If it's not the greatest, I'm gonna be honest, I did not care for the mask with the logo
113720	117200	in the corner, because what happens is that the folding of the mask kind of makes the
117200	119760	logo disappear, so yeah.
119760	122100	But you can still get it if you want, otherwise it's a quality mask.
122100	125880	We have a different mask that's got like VoG super big on it, so that works too.
125880	131280	But all that available, the shirts are great, I actually, Loki's got the OLR shirt, I have
131280	136640	the VoG Network shirts, and they turned out really good, so quality products over at the
136640	137640	shop.
137640	143080	VoGnetwork.com slash shop, if you want to check that out, ooh, hi, hi DarkSakura, we
143080	145680	hear you, do you hear us?
145680	150320	Okay, she doesn't, this is gonna be very awkward, this is gonna be like the most awkward Zoom
150320	161000	holiday thing tonight, anyway, hi, we hear you DarkSakura, loud and clear, can you hear
161000	162000	us?
162000	163000	Okay.
163000	166400	I think that is a no.
166400	168640	She doesn't even know she's coming through on the show.
168640	175880	She's just trying to stress the importance of COVID testing, and you know, we should
175880	181560	all be vigilant, especially considering the situation.
181560	187800	I'm texting her right now that we heard you, you just can't hear us, that's right, you're
187800	192580	right, she's stressing the importance of making sure that you get tested, see, testing is
192580	199980	so important, COVID testing, exactly, oh, her camp's coming on, so hopefully at some
199980	207200	point she'll be able to see and hear us, all right, anyway, Loki, what's the game playing
207200	208200	behind you tonight?
208200	213820	I'm trying to figure it out, it looks like a 3D King's Quest sort of thing, what is that
213820	215900	playing behind you tonight?
215900	220220	It's visceral cleanup detail, Santa's rampage.
220220	222900	I have not heard of that.
222900	228780	Do you remember visceral cleanup detail is basically, it was you're coming in after like,
228780	235300	like a shmup, like an FPS, like shooter, and you're cleaning up all the bodies and blood
235300	239180	and bullets and stuff that are left behind, so that's the premise of the game.
239180	240180	Interesting.
240180	245140	So in this case, you are cleaning up after Santa's rampage through his workshop.
245140	246140	Is this an itch.io game?
246140	248180	This sounds kind of funny, I like that.
248180	253820	I think it is on itch.io, but it's definitely on Steam, it's been in a few humble bundles,
253820	255300	so that's where I got it from.
255300	256300	Love it.
256300	260660	I'm also, what was cracking me up too is that when Dark Soccer's cam came on, the room was
260660	267140	completely empty, like it's like, what the hell's going on, we were getting ghost Jamie
267140	272660	for a minute there, that's what they're saying in chat, over at our chat, can Jamie hear
272660	274660	us now?
274660	276380	I don't know if she can.
276380	281220	Okay, so it's still, you gotta love it.
281220	286580	All right, I will give our chat room a plug over at twitch.tv slash vog network because
286580	290520	we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right
290520	295340	after the Bobby Black Wolf show, again, twitch.tv slash vog network, six o'clock Pacific, nine
295340	296340	o'clock Eastern.
296340	300420	Some comments coming in, Quest Buster says the shirt does look comfy, and if we were
300420	304180	in Cyberpunk, that shirt just added 180 points of armor.
304180	305940	Yes.
305940	311860	No One Special 77 is talking about, I have the Steam version of that game, the visceral
311860	313740	cleaning, is that what it's called?
313740	320940	Yeah, visceral cleanup detail, I think, or duty, yeah, I've played it before, I didn't
320940	327580	really know what to do in it, but having watched this video, I kind of have an idea of what
327580	328740	you're supposed to do.
328740	333620	It just, it was hard, it's a very tedious game because you have to mop stuff and you
333620	340260	have to move stuff around, but it's silly, a lot of people speed run it, so it's fun.
340260	344500	Is it part of, because I know Bobby was just doing a cheap plug for Awesome Games Done
344500	347260	Quick, it's coming up in just two weeks, where did the time go?
347260	351420	I didn't realize it was only two weeks away, but it's just, I guess it's one of those things,
351420	354780	2020, is this one of the games they're going to be doing?
354780	358580	I know they've done it in the past, I don't know if they were doing it this time, but
358580	364020	yeah, because originally I had actually picked Christmas Nights, but I thought that was kind
364020	369940	of obvious, and I think I've done that, we've done that in the past, but I wanted to mix
369940	373500	it up a bit, so that's why I was like, oh yeah, there's that game, and I have to remember
373500	380420	what the name was, so yeah, let me see if they have it in there, I don't know if it's
380420	383420	probably being done this year, but I know they have done in the past because I've watched
383420	386940	it and some of the crazy stuff they do with that.
386940	387940	Nice.
387980	391140	I think we may have had a breakthrough on the Dark Soccer tech situation, are you with
391140	392140	us now, Jamie?
392140	393780	I am, can you hear me?
393780	398500	You did it, yes, we hear you, all is well, hello.
398500	402900	My headset kind of took a dive and then my computer was having some problems booting
402900	409380	it up, so I finally just said fuck it, and set up my new mic.
409380	414020	Well it looks nice, you got your whole little pop guard and a little professional mic over
414020	415020	there, it looks nice.
415460	422140	It's one of those Audio-Technica ones, rather than like 200 and something bucks, I actually
422140	425580	had a really good deal and got it for 110, so why not?
425580	428700	Well the chat is saying you're a little quieter than usual, so you might just have to work
428700	431540	with the positioning and things like that, maybe get the, uh oh, get the...
431540	435380	Actually I think you have, it could be mixer settings on, perhaps on your side, because
435380	438260	I haven't found a way to increase the sensitivity over on my side.
438260	442700	No, because you guys are filtered through Discord, so if I change anything, it's you
442700	444100	and Loki.
444180	450060	My mic setup is for 100%, so I'll see if I've got something else that I can adjust.
450060	453780	Oh yeah, actually, you know what, I can always bump you up in Discord, but when you got close
453780	455620	to the mic there, I think you were good.
455620	457180	Don't you love live tech support?
457180	458180	Alright.
458180	461900	Well, that and my pop filter will not stay where the hell I put it.
461900	462900	It's fine.
462900	463900	Is this any better?
463900	464900	It is to me.
464900	470140	Chat, if she's too quiet, let me know, because I can always boost or deafen, I can use Discord
470140	472540	as a mixer too, if I need to.
472540	476100	I think I have the AT2020.
476100	481700	One of my friends recommended it to me, and so that's what I'm using, and I really like
481700	487420	their audio output, and so I decided to go for it.
487420	488420	You sound really good to me.
488420	489420	Does this sound any different than my old mic?
489420	491040	You sound a lot better.
491040	494900	It's a lot clearer, and I can hear it fine in my headset, for what it's worth, so I think
494900	495900	you're good.
495900	500700	So tech issues aside, before we get into the big gaming story this week, because of course
500700	504580	we are a video game podcast, and there's a lot of gaming news about one particular
504580	508540	game, and I know it's a game that's not really on your radar, Dark Soccer, and it's not really
508540	509540	on mine.
509540	514060	Why the fuck would I play something broken?
514060	516220	This is going to be a Loki segment coming up.
516220	518620	Skyrim is a great game.
518620	519620	True.
519620	527460	Let me just ask quickly, I know Hanukkah just finished up, so happy belated Hanukkah I suppose
527460	534240	at this point, but I will say I will miss our annual Christmas gathering, because you
534240	540980	and I historically have always gone out for Chinese food or pho, or whatever we can find
540980	546940	that's open on Christmas, and we don't get to do that this year because of the situation.
546940	549620	So I'll miss that this year.
549620	553460	Totally, actually.
553460	555020	I had a negative test.
555020	556400	Oh, congrats.
556400	559880	If y'all had negative tests, we can get some damn takeout.
559880	560880	Maybe we'll see.
560880	561880	We'll see.
561880	564240	We can always eat outdoors or something if it's not too cold.
564240	565240	Do something like that.
565240	566240	Okay.
566240	567240	It'll be fun.
567240	568240	It's cold.
568240	569240	All right.
569240	570240	It is a little cold.
570240	571240	All right.
571240	572240	Let's get into video game stuff, though.
572240	574380	Huge, big news this week.
574380	578440	This is kind of shocking, honestly.
578440	580800	And I think y'all know where this is going to go with Cyberpunk.
580800	586540	Let's let Loki kick this off and state the obvious that is in the back of all your minds
586540	587700	with this.
587700	591580	So Cyberpunk's a little bit rough.
591580	599280	So especially on the earlier gen consoles, so like a PlayStation 4 and Xbox One hasn't
599280	601520	been running the best.
601520	602520	And that was something that's been kind of...
602520	603760	You're very nice.
603760	607620	You're very nice.
607620	609900	It looks like Saints Row.
609900	617140	In fact, it's getting a lot of that Saints Row vibe from it.
617140	620860	But yeah, so it hasn't been running good at all.
620860	623180	And so they've actually come out.
623180	629360	CG Prodigy Red has come out and actually apologized with their wonderful yellow text
629360	635860	or yellow background text where they've said, first off, we would like to start by apologizing
635860	642100	to you for not showing the game on the base of the last gen consoles before it premiered.
642100	646060	And in consequence, we're not allowing you to make more informed decisions about your
646060	647060	purchase.
647060	652500	We should have paid more attention to making it play better on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
652500	653500	Right.
653500	655440	But you knew.
655440	658900	And you also were advertising it in such a way.
658900	664900	And you were also preventing people from being able to review it and showcasing that stuff
664940	665940	as well.
665940	673860	So yeah, it's a little hard to feel like that's a genuine apology, but whatever.
673860	677700	I'm going to interject because we got a lot to unpack just in that two minutes, okay?
677700	678780	We got a lot to unpack.
678780	682220	So let's get our emotional baggage out here for a minute.
682220	683220	Here's the thing.
683220	685540	And I think this is important to state.
685540	688660	For a lot of people, the game isn't broken.
688660	690180	And I think that's important to put.
690740	695020	It may be kind of broken, but in a Bethesda game way, or as you said, like a Saints Row,
695020	699020	like there are character and Bobby showed examples of some of this on his show earlier
699020	702400	because he used his clipping feature to show some of this stuff.
702400	706580	For instance, characters that just walk right through lockers like they're not even there.
706580	710580	Characters that run over street poles because fuck street poles and things like that.
710580	715860	There's a lot of that stuff that's buggy, but otherwise the game is fine.
715860	722420	If you are on a high-end PC, you're playing on Google Stadia, you're playing on Xbox Series X,
722420	729020	you're playing on PlayStation 5, where we're running into some real tragedies are some
729020	733460	people that are playing on PlayStation 4 and that are playing on Xbox One.
733460	737980	Now, I do think it is important to make that distinction because I think there are a lot
737980	740340	of people out there that are like, what's the problem?
740660	746740	Well, the problem is that the game is not running the way people expected it to run
746740	750260	for a game that was advertised for the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One.
750260	754340	Here's where the problem gets really fucking complicated.
754340	759100	So, Loki, that part you said there, they put out a yellow statement and all this thing
759100	764740	and said, we should have realized that the game wasn't running up to speed or whatever
764740	767860	it was on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
767860	769980	Did I state that correctly?
770020	771460	Is kind of what their line was?
771460	773060	Yeah, yeah.
773060	774340	You fucking knew.
774340	775580	You fucking knew.
775580	780100	And not only did they fucking know, they suppressed.
780100	781820	And how did they suppress?
781820	786660	When they sent out all these review copies, they told people, you have to play it on a high-end PC.
786660	791620	They didn't give out any review codes for PlayStation or Microsoft.
791620	799540	And they put out an NDA that said, you cannot show footage from this game.
799540	803260	You must use our approved footage.
803260	806060	And that should have been the first sign that something was up.
806060	812460	Now, I think most of us kind of went, oh, it's because of this whole Day Zero patch they're doing.
812460	816980	There's something really bad in the pre-patch stuff that they don't want out there.
816980	819780	So they want to make sure that what's being shown is a patched version.
819780	822980	I think that's what most of us wrote off that NDA as.
822980	827500	But now we're seeing there was something way more sinister going on here.
827500	833820	And what CD Projekt Red was really trying to avoid was the reception that Mass Effect Andromeda got.
833820	839100	And I know I'm invoking the Holy Series of Mass Effect here, but I'm doing it for a reason.
839100	841340	Why did that game get shit on?
841340	845140	And I mean shit on just days before it released.
845140	852460	Because EA stupidly put that buggy game out on that advance thing through EA.
852460	863260	And all these people were ripping their own footage of heads spinning round, bodies flopping on the floor and all these things that made Andromeda look like a buggy ass mess.
863260	866500	So everybody was like, I'm not buying that fucking game.
866500	872140	Dark Sakura, I will ask your opinion here because you you follow the holy book of Mass Effect like I do.
872140	877460	Isn't that kind of how Mass Effect Andromeda got screwed?
877500	881380	You're muted just so you know, it's a hard mute on Discord.
881380	887700	Um, kind of sort of because I don't think Mass Effect Andromeda had nearly the problems that Cyberpunk does.
887700	898740	I agree. I actually I definitely agree with that statement, but it's actually a pretty it was actually a pretty finished game.
898740	904740	It was lacking like a few touches, like the whole dead eyes thing and some of the dialogue choices.
904740	910140	But for the most part, it wasn't super buggy, but the Internet fixated on those bugs.
910140	913380	Right. And so the games there weren't many.
913380	918540	Right. But Cyberpunk has plenty even on the high end.
918540	922420	Right. And that's what CD Projekt Red was trying to hide.
922420	928540	And that's my point is that those few bugs, when they got out, really tanked Mass Effect Andromeda's performance.
928860	938460	You really I really can't be convinced that didn't impact the bottom line of of Andromeda and how it sold because of how people responded to that whole thing.
938460	945060	I think there were other factors in there, just simply the fact that Bioware was putting more into Anthem at the time,
945060	953700	and it wasn't continuing with everybody's favorite characters or their storylines, unlike what Dragon Age four is doing.
953740	959940	So I think that might have been more part of it than just the aesthetics of it.
959940	964940	Or, you know, it was it was all like too much, too new.
964940	968300	And then on top of that, adding in just those minor things.
968300	970460	Right. So on that on that, we agree.
970460	972300	But I had something different going for it.
972300	978900	Right. And I think we definitely have some common ground here because, yeah, no, I agree with you that Cyberpunk and I haven't played it.
978900	982060	So that's why I feel a little bit hesitant to say something definitively here.
982060	987060	But everything that I'm seeing online, all the reaction stuff is that it is a bug year game.
987060	989700	And I do think so I agree with you on that, too.
989700	1000460	And I think the reason why I invoked Mass Effect Andromeda and the reception that it got with those bugs is that that was the situation CD Projekt Red was trying to avoid by saying you can't take your own video.
1000460	1002180	You have to show this pre-approved video.
1002180	1009900	You're not going to play it on PlayStation four and Xbox one because we know somebody knows this game doesn't run nearly as well on those platforms.
1009900	1016860	So we are going to try to continue this hype for this game going and not shoot it in the foot.
1016860	1024380	Like I think has been done in the past with other products when they released, you know, early for everybody to look at and then the warts and all kind of show up.
1024380	1031580	And I think it caused this situation now to get worse because they tried to suppress that message.
1031580	1033420	And it's the truth.
1033420	1035580	It always comes out, girl.
1035580	1037380	It always comes out.
1037380	1039060	That should have been the first clue.
1039060	1045620	I mean, the whole point of a review is honesty, I think it is.
1045620	1049660	I mean, to the developers, it's the.
1049660	1062180	OK, we want to sell our game and we want it to look a certain way, but the true heart of what a review is, is to say this is what product you are buying.
1062180	1066820	So there's a difference between a review and a sponsorship.
1066820	1068420	And they were looking for a sponsorship.
1068420	1083460	Yes, and it's interesting because there was a piece I was reading out there that was being critical of organizations that ran the review with the NDA, calling them corporate sellouts and things like this that I don't agree with that strong of a message.
1083460	1088460	I kind of think most of these review outlets gave you the tools you needed to figure it out for yourself.
1088460	1094460	They were transparent in saying there was an NDA and that there was, you know, they couldn't show actual footage from the game.
1094500	1103500	We assumed and I'll say we as part of that, too, because I remember saying it on the show that, oh, it's because of the day zero patch and they don't want to show like how bad it is.
1103500	1105260	Little did we know it's much worse.
1105260	1109140	I don't think the problem for that is with the journalists at all.
1109140	1124420	That problem. And so I think I think people who are writing pieces like that, in my opinion, and you're not going to like this, but in my opinion, you got yourself to blame for setting up that kind of industry that requires day zero reviews.
1124420	1131380	That, you know, feeds on Metacritic scores and my game is better than your game.
1131380	1144380	And I think that's on you, person that writes that piece about how all of that is bad for creating that type of gaming industry that CD Projekt Red was just playing into.
1144380	1159260	I'm not I'm not letting CD Projekt Red off the hook because I think ultimately at the end of the day, the only satisfactory end to this, the only satisfactory end to this is that the CEOs of CD Projekt Red are finished.
1159260	1163180	They retire. That's they knew this was going on.
1163380	1164820	They let the hype keep going.
1164980	1167380	They put all these constraints on it as it was.
1167580	1171020	They've got to go, period.
1171020	1172700	Not gonna though. I mean, think about it.
1172860	1174980	I, I, I don't dark soccer.
1174980	1177820	I totally get the pessimistic perspective.
1178060	1186100	I think the investors in Poland, because they are a publicly traded company in Poland, I think the investors are so pissed off.
1186260	1189260	And at the end of the day, video games are making money.
1189540	1197780	I think the investors are so pissed off about this whole situation that it is now I think it's on the table and good.
1197780	1199060	It should be on the table.
1200060	1203940	In my opinion, yeah, this is this sorry, sorry, Loki, I will let you finish.
1203940	1208500	I know there's more to say, I was gonna say this is not the fault of the developers.
1208900	1211500	This is not the fault of the artist.
1211700	1220420	This is not the fault of the people that were working their asses off on crunch time to try to deliver this game that was promised.
1220740	1230900	This was a fuck up of epic proportions by management, period.
1230900	1240980	And to kind of go along with that also, there is a story out of Bloomberg that is actually talking about the developers asking the leadership, you know, what was going on?
1240980	1250380	You know, basically saying that developers ask blunt questions about the company's reputation, the game's unrealistic deadlines and the relentless overtime in the months and years leading up to the game.
1251100	1252540	December 10th release.
1254580	1265660	So, you know, I don't know, it almost feels like like I get that I think releasing on so many platforms all at once was kind of a problem.
1265660	1279780	And I know other consoles, games have done similar things where they've postponed certain versions of it, like say, for example, you know, PC pretty solid right now, maybe release on PC and delay the console a month.
1280700	1281700	Would have been smart.
1282340	1283620	Here's what would have been smart.
1283860	1285380	Sorry, Loki. Here's what would have been smart.
1285820	1288220	CD Projekt Red should have went to Google.
1288620	1291100	The minute they knew this was going on, they should have went to Google instead.
1291380	1296980	What if we made you an offer to be exclusive on Stadia and PC for six months?
1297580	1303180	What if we made you that offer and then get the money from Google to go exclusive on Stadia?
1303180	1318820	Because the game's fine on Stadia outside of the bugs, which is which is a whole other episode of OLR about here we are now that like Stadia has got its best use case scenario by a complete use case, by a complete fuck up of another organization.
1318940	1319420	Right.
1322060	1323660	Go ahead, Jamie, you've been trying to get away.
1324060	1341340	I was going to make a point just a little bit before, but and actually, it also said it in chat is that this is a big reason why there needs to be unionization for our developers and for people who work in the gaming industry.
1342860	1344460	Yes, 100 percent agree.
1344700	1351260	This unions would have helped here, I think, quite a bit, especially when it came to the crunch time and things of that sort.
1351260	1351980	Absolutely.
1352300	1357660	So just be mindful, Jamie, if you're talking sideways on the mike, it doesn't pick up quite as much as when you're talking direct.
1357700	1358220	Sorry.
1359700	1361100	The chat, you can probably used to it.
1361220	1363700	You can also probably just drop the pop guard if it's getting in the way.
1363780	1364260	Oh, there you go.
1364260	1367940	There we go, because I don't want to, you know, spew on everybody.
1367940	1368860	So, yeah.
1369420	1369820	All right.
1370220	1371660	So Jamie's just got to get used to it.
1371660	1372340	You guys in chat.
1372340	1373260	She's got a whole new set.
1373260	1374500	She's not using a headset anymore.
1374500	1378700	She's using an adult microphone, just like the ones we had here.
1378700	1378940	It's true.
1378940	1379380	Oh, my gosh.
1379540	1380740	OK, Loki, I'm sorry.
1380740	1383860	We keep cutting you off, but this is a very passionate topic, isn't it?
1384780	1385260	Sure.
1385660	1398780	So aside from, you know, the obvious problems with the leadership, you know, some more stuff talking about like crunch, you know, they were being forced to work six hour day or I'm sorry, six days a week.
1399100	1408740	And even more so after the games, you know, final delay, they were having even more crunch involved with that as well.
1409180	1418020	And then, of course, we get word, you know, about them offering to refund the game if you're unhappy with your purchase.
1418020	1425740	So they set up a email address that is open until, well, tomorrow, they're shutting it off.
1425740	1439820	And also, apparently, you know, with that, because there were so many refunds being issued on the like PlayStation Store, Sony straight up pulled the game from the PlayStation Store.
1439820	1446500	You can't buy it digitally anymore for right now until they sort this stuff out.
1446740	1448940	So they went ahead and pulled it out.
1448940	1452980	They said SIE strives to ensure a high level of customer satisfaction.
1453300	1459820	Therefore, we will begin to offer full refunds for all the gamers who have purchased Cyberpunk 2077 via the PlayStation Store.
1460100	1466180	And we will also be removing Cyberpunk 2077 from the PlayStation Store until further notice.
1468340	1475060	It says once we have confirmed you have purchased Cyberpunk 2077 via PlayStation Store, we will process your begin processing your refund.
1475620	1482700	And then, of course, along with that, later on, Xbox also followed suit.
1482700	1485380	They brought or took it down off their storefront.
1485940	1498060	Best Buy has said basically they're going to offer refunds on the physical copies via their in store by mail through December 21st, which apparently is when there's some sort of patch coming out.
1498060	1501540	That's why it all seems to end on December 21st.
1502140	1505620	And then. What else?
1505620	1517420	So we also had a seizure product read saying that they are going to be offering some sort of refunds as well for players who are unable to secure one through the store which they purchased it.
1517900	1519460	So that'll be limited as well.
1520460	1535140	Also, apparently, the execs came out and apologized again as well, saying that they had ignored signals that the console versions that they hyped were in rough shape.
1536420	1546140	The game launched way below expectations and they ignored the signals that more time was needed to make sure that the games are ready.
1546740	1549940	It was the wrong approach and against our business philosophy.
1549940	1554740	On top of that, during the campaign, we showed the game mostly on PC.
1554740	1559540	We definitely did not spend enough time looking at PlayStation 4 and Xbox One performance.
1559940	1565580	And this is coming from the vice president, Michael Nowakowski.
1566380	1574420	And the reason we didn't show the game of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is that we were updating the game on last gen consoles until the very last minute.
1574620	1576460	And we thought we'd make it in time.
1576660	1583660	Unfortunately, this resulted in giving it to reviewers just one day before the release, which is definitely too late.
1583660	1586660	And the media didn't get the chance to review it properly.
1587540	1594260	Are we are they really blaming the reviewers for the low scores on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One?
1594260	1595900	Because that's what sort of sounds like.
1597340	1598980	They said that was not intended.
1598980	1601820	We were just fixing the game up until the very last moment.
1602540	1607780	And yeah, let me get some comments from chat here.
1608060	1618140	Number one, and most importantly, the chat room is going bananas for Midna, which I think might be our first Dark Soccer's cat, Midna, showing up on stream during the show.
1618380	1624180	But there's Midna in mommy's arms there getting some cuddles.
1624700	1632460	Some other comments in chat talking about, even though Cyberpunk is no longer being sold on Sony Store, it is continuing to be sold on the Microsoft Store.
1632460	1639260	And I've actually seen that myself, because in the rewards app, actually, you get a thing for visiting the Cyberpunk page.
1639380	1646060	And there's a big old thing on there that says note may not currently run best on Xbox One.
1646060	1648180	Like there's a big old like disclaimer on there.
1649020	1650420	Hard to miss right now.
1650740	1652660	I guess they're just doing refunds.
1652660	1661300	I thought they were taking some funny thing that I did see online was folks complaining about the fact that if they did a refund that they still couldn't play the game.
1661300	1663980	It's like, what do you think a refund is?
1663980	1665260	You know, it's a game for free.
1665340	1667420	That is that is that is what a refund is.
1667420	1669140	You no longer have access to the product.
1669140	1670460	Stop trying to game the system.
1670740	1671740	That's not what it's worth.
1672020	1679980	Yeah. So and Bobby Black Wolf in chat saying you can still buy the PlayStation 4 disc version.
1680140	1682300	They thought it was a refund, but not a return.
1682340	1684980	So, yeah, like don't game the system, guys.
1684980	1688540	If you're playing the game and enjoying the game, the refund's not for you.
1688540	1689500	So knock it off.
1690900	1699180	But obviously, there's some people the part about that that gets me is that email that they're shutting off tomorrow.
1699420	1707180	How convenient when copies of this game are going to be showing up under the tree for many people in four or five days.
1707420	1710100	So that's kind of shady.
1710700	1714420	Another bad decision among bad decisions, but it is what it is.
1714460	1721500	Honestly, like I get I get people are unhappy with it, but like I think it will get better.
1721500	1726460	I am hoping that it at least it's got at least it's not a live service game.
1726460	1728100	So it's got that going for it.
1728500	1731620	So I think it will get better.
1731620	1735620	I'm hoping it will end up like a no man's sky where eventually it gets patched.
1735980	1738580	It it really should not have been released this way.
1738580	1744340	And it's it's frustrating to hear like almost every single major game release out there.
1744340	1750140	Now we run into the same thing at launch, some cases much worse than others.
1750140	1754420	But it's always like patching after the fact, releasing buggy games.
1754420	1758460	It's like, do we not finish a game before releasing it?
1758460	1759380	It doesn't make any sense.
1759700	1763620	Maybe the shock and awe of this situation.
1763620	1767780	And if the CEOs do get ousted by the board, which again, I hope it happens.
1767780	1768580	I really do.
1769260	1770780	I got my popcorn ready to go.
1771580	1775100	But what I don't want to happen is I don't want the studio to go under.
1775100	1777220	I do not want job loss at that studio.
1777220	1781740	I do not want the developers to suffer the consequences and the artists and those that that
1781740	1783260	is what I do not want to happen.
1783500	1786420	This the cuts need to be made at the top.
1787660	1789700	That is what has to happen in this situation.
1789820	1796020	And I hope that other companies see this situation and go, oh, you know, maybe you're
1796020	1801140	right, learn something from this and make sure this doesn't happen to future releases.
1801140	1804300	Now, I will say this, Loki, when you we talk about the game being in a better state and
1804300	1809340	everything again for me, when I do decide to get the game, when that, you know, game of
1809340	1814100	the year edition with all the DLC and all that included, when I finally do buy it, Xbox
1814100	1818980	Series X and PlayStation 5 will be the full on current generation by that point, because
1818980	1823140	we'll be in two years in and the game runs fine on those.
1823540	1828460	Well, so consider this, too, though, like the one version that you're playing right now on
1828460	1835940	the Xbox Series X or whatever is just the Xbox one version that has some additional Xbox
1835940	1837180	Series X enhancements.
1837260	1841740	It's not the actual Xbox Series X or PlayStation five versions.
1841980	1843780	Those are supposed to be coming out in March.
1843980	1847100	So the game will be even better by March.
1847460	1853660	It's just that if I think they were still trying to tune those for that additional, like
1853660	1857620	compatibility with those new systems, but they forgot, it's like, oh, yeah, you know, you
1857620	1864940	also have the base Xbox one, you know, or the Xbox one s, you know, the old stuff that
1865620	1867300	might not run it as well.
1867340	1874940	And it's we kind of saw this, you know, even way before the days of patching stuff, like we
1874940	1879140	saw some games that would be released between these consoles, you know, back on like
1879540	1885500	PlayStation two and PlayStation three and then Xbox 360 and like Xbox and all these
1885500	1890300	different consoles, like releasing a nine different consoles, you know, and obviously
1890300	1895020	some versions of the game would be good and some versions of the game would be very rough.
1895540	1899540	Well, I remember a day when like Mortal Kombat came out on the Game Boy.
1899900	1903620	And if you bought the Game Boy version of Mortal Kombat, you knew you were not going to
1903620	1909500	get the same game that the people on the Super Nintendo like you knew, but they also
1909500	1910540	didn't try to hide that.
1910860	1912140	They didn't try to hide it either.
1912140	1918820	You would see Game Boy screenshots in magazines and go, oh, that's a that's a scaled back
1918820	1919780	version of that game.
1919980	1921660	Right. And try to hide it.
1921660	1923260	That's a huge, huge difference.
1923540	1925220	I want to point out something in chat as well.
1925620	1928780	Zen Monkey in chat says it's the full game, right?
1928780	1930300	Nothing is missing. It's just buggy.
1930300	1932340	So it's not a no man's sky, in my opinion.
1932540	1933500	I agree with that.
1933660	1935660	A lot of comparisons to No Man's Sky.
1935660	1937620	I think these are hugely different scenarios.
1937820	1942620	Now, I'm not just saying that because, yes, I'm a fanboy of No Man's Sky now.
1943020	1947860	But I remember when that game came out, the problem with that game was not that it was a
1947860	1952900	buggy, unplayable mess or that, you know, the problem in that game was that the hype
1952900	1955220	machine got out of control.
1955460	1958300	And it's what I'm calling the Molyneux effect.
1958460	1964260	OK, it's the the Peter Molyneux effect, meaning I hyped the shit out of something I
1964260	1966180	couldn't really deliver on.
1966380	1973820	It didn't necessarily make the game bad fable, but the game was not exactly what we had
1973820	1976300	promised. In fact, in many ways, it wasn't what we promised.
1976500	1980460	But I remember when that came out, I remember go back to the episode when that game came
1980460	1983860	out and I reviewed it and I said, it's not that bad.
1984100	1989940	It's a little bit dry, but I think I enjoy this game more than most because I always
1989940	1993340	questioned those speeches that they were giving when they were showing off the game.
1993500	1995900	And I always was the one going, where's the game?
1995900	1998780	What's the game? And I refused to buy into the hype with that game.
1998900	2001820	Therefore, when the game came out, I was like, it's OK.
2002140	2006180	And now we're in a spot years and years later where the game is better than OK.
2006180	2010460	In fact, I would say it's a must play if you haven't played it yet, especially when it
2010460	2015220	comes to Series X and PlayStation 5, assuming they ever fix that HDR thing.
2015220	2018380	But Series X, for sure, it's a must play at this point.
2020140	2022820	I think it's a very different sort of thing.
2024180	2028700	But I'm not saying, oh, it wasn't a problem at all.
2028700	2030260	No, it was a problem. It was a different problem.
2031780	2038980	And I'm not even sure this CD Projekt RED, pardon me, Cyberpunk thing is as big of an
2038980	2040700	issue as one other game I can think of.
2041020	2044060	Actually, can I mention real quick, I know we want to get to other stories tonight.
2044060	2045420	We don't want the show to run too long.
2045620	2050020	I ran an informal poll on my Twitter account about this whole thing.
2050420	2052420	So did you see my poll?
2052500	2053620	Did you guys vote in my poll?
2053980	2055500	OK, I did not see your poll.
2055540	2056940	OK, here's the question I asked.
2057820	2062100	Is Cyberpunk and Tigerclaw will find the link and post the poll because he usually
2062100	2064140	does so I'm not putting them on the spot or anything.
2064300	2065740	OK, here's the tweet I wrote.
2065740	2072420	It said, is Cyberpunk 2077 the biggest failure of an organization's management and
2072420	2074180	executives in video game history?
2074900	2077420	And believe it or not, one hundred and seven people voted in my poll.
2077420	2079020	So this is very scientific, you guys.
2079540	2080900	Fifty three percent.
2080940	2082340	Your question was quite loaded.
2082700	2084380	Maybe. Well, here's the answer.
2084580	2086660	Fifty three percent said yes.
2087500	2090340	Forty seven percent said stop being dramatic.
2092020	2095100	So there's people that do think it's pretty.
2095260	2098660	Now, looking back and when I wrote that question, obviously it was very tongue in
2098660	2100020	cheek. It was a tweet, you guys.
2100020	2101100	It wasn't a scientific poll.
2103580	2112900	I actually think Final Fantasy 14 1.0 was a bigger fuck up that was so bad, so bad that
2112900	2118140	it almost killed an entire franchise dating back to like 1987.
2120020	2123900	But there's there are things about this cyberpunk scenario that make it quite
2123900	2130060	unique. And the good news is in Final Fantasy 14, they were able to fix it years
2130060	2134980	after the fact. But the Final Fantasy 14 now is like not even the same game it was
2134980	2136380	when it came out. That's how they fixed it.
2136380	2139380	They just released a new game called Final Fantasy 14 that had some of the same
2139380	2140540	ideas. So.
2141940	2147580	So, Loki, now that you know the question, is this the biggest management fuck up and
2147580	2150940	specifically management, is this the biggest management fuck up of no time of all
2150940	2152620	time? Yes. Or stop being dramatic?
2153900	2155420	Stop being dramatic.
2156940	2159940	This isn't that. It could be worse.
2161380	2165620	I mean, how like was it last year with WWE, their 2K game?
2167020	2168140	I mean, that's pretty bad.
2168140	2172620	And then on top of that, you know, they also want to charge for microtransactions.
2173980	2175420	I mean, geez, it's like.
2177380	2181460	Every few months we have one of these, so I don't think it's the worst anthem.
2181860	2186180	I mean, Fallout 76, anyone?
2186500	2190300	I mean, there's so many, so many to choose from.
2192100	2198020	And yeah, looking looking back on it, I'm not sure it would be the biggest ever, but
2198060	2200180	I think it's going to be one of the most memorable.
2200780	2202700	I think Fallout 76 tops it.
2202740	2203980	I mean, like that is just.
2205060	2206500	How ironic. Look at my shirt I'm wearing.
2206540	2207700	Do you see the shirt I'm wearing today?
2209260	2210780	One mistake after another.
2210780	2213900	I mean, it's like over and over and over again.
2213900	2216540	And it's just like they can't do anything right.
2217540	2220420	Anything like it was just all sorts of messed up.
2220420	2222180	I don't know what the state is now.
2222180	2225420	I'm assuming since I haven't heard about it in a while, it's slightly better.
2225420	2228340	But like it was just all over the place.
2228780	2232460	OK, of course, some comments and chat coming in on this.
2232460	2235060	No one special says the virtual boy says hi.
2236060	2239340	Let's see, S2100 Matt says this is an E.T.
2239340	2241780	on the Atari that folks are treating this like.
2242060	2243340	That is a great.
2243580	2248060	You know what? I'm going to give a gold star chat comment of the week to that comment.
2248340	2249500	I didn't even think of that.
2249700	2254940	But that is also a brilliant example of how management fucked a game, because I know that
2254940	2259500	Howard Scott Warshaw, who authored that game, worked his fucking ass off to deliver it in
2259500	2264780	six weeks, because that's what management made him do, because that was the deal that
2264900	2268420	was reached with Steven Spielberg and all that to get the game out for Christmas and
2268420	2269220	all of that stuff.
2269420	2273740	So I think you gave a real damn good example of something that's almost a bigger
2273740	2278340	management fuck up because and then that game caused the video game crash of 1983.
2279020	2284460	OK, maybe not directly, but things like that decision definitely caused the entire
2284460	2286980	industry to kablamo.
2287020	2288620	So let me let me offer something.
2288620	2290220	This is going back to a previous point.
2290540	2292060	Last comment on this and then we'll move on.
2292100	2296780	Well, it's kind of a bigger commentary, but I want to offer up this thought.
2296780	2302820	So we talked about, you know, if the industry had been unionized recently or that they
2302820	2309980	should unionize, what if the industry had unionized prior to the 83 crash?
2310860	2314500	Who would we be in a situation like this?
2314500	2318220	What we have to deal? I mean, I still think we would have things like these, you know,
2318260	2326140	got awful microtransactions or we'd we'd still have to see, you know, rushed releases.
2326140	2330620	But the thing is, it's actually we may not see the rush releases because employees would
2330620	2334620	be set for a certain number of hours, a certain number of privileges for the work they
2334620	2335820	put into the game.
2335820	2341740	And the the managers, the ones who were basically fucking shit up, they would be the
2341740	2346300	ones who then go and then have to maintain those standards.
2346620	2348660	So they would be held liable to it as well.
2348660	2351260	And we might actually get more realistic development cycles.
2352900	2359660	The other thing that I'm thinking of in this one, too, is that now this is you know, I've
2359660	2363060	been putting a lot of thought to this and what you bringing up the crash really made me
2363420	2364580	want to focus on it more.
2366700	2370940	The other thing, too, is that just going into the social standpoint of working in the
2370940	2374460	video game industry, we may not have some of the disparities that we have right now, too.
2376780	2381180	I'm going to give a very blunt response to the question that you may think I'm joking,
2381180	2381860	but I'm not.
2382860	2386340	OK, no, I'm going to give you my very honest answer, and this is going to be something
2386340	2390860	where you're like, I am not happy Rob said that, but it's it's the truth.
2391940	2399460	If video game unions in 1983 meant that cocaine would be forbidden in the workplace, the
2399460	2401580	industry would not be in the position it's at now.
2402620	2404980	No, I I understand that.
2404980	2405540	Trust me.
2406220	2408460	Like that, that's real talk.
2408460	2414500	Like if that meant there was no cocaine, folks, I'm just saying, how do you think those
2414500	2419140	games got turned around in six weeks, like and the winners?
2419780	2422300	Why do you think, OK, here we go.
2422380	2423700	Hello, Pandora's box.
2423700	2424580	We're going to open you.
2424580	2425860	We're going to unpack some stuff.
2425860	2427980	Hello, maybe in the US, Rob.
2428300	2432420	Why do you think the video game industry then felt such an onus to put these things on
2432420	2437900	their games about FBI warning winners don't use drugs and all this stuff in the 90s
2437900	2441540	because the video game industry was born from drugs in the 80s?
2441540	2446140	Like so much of it was like and again, I'm sorry, it's not the answer anyone wants to
2446140	2447900	hear, but it's just the reality.
2447940	2453180	So like I but I guess I'm not I'm not trying to just discredit your point, dark soccer.
2453220	2459060	I just think like games were developed in such a different way in the 1980s versus the
2459060	2460220	way they're done today.
2460460	2466020	I'm actually I almost feel like the effect a union would have in the 80s would just have
2466020	2470860	completely transformed everything like we wouldn't have E.T., we wouldn't have Yars
2470860	2473540	Revenge, we would have any of it because we didn't have drugs.
2473580	2477980	That's one thing. But I also do sort of think that and I'd actually have to dig more into
2477980	2482980	that because now I'm curious as to the whole winners don't use drugs, you know, crack.
2484340	2489540	But I'm thinking that maybe there might have been just some sort of subsidy or some sort
2489540	2490940	of requirement for publishing.
2490980	2494500	I have to look at what the jurisdiction was when all that was going down, because we
2494500	2501580	don't see it anymore in our very few modern arcade releases that we happen to get.
2502100	2507300	But it's sort of my thought that that might have been some sort of almost subsidizing
2507300	2511300	like a like our current YouTube ads and crazy things like that.
2511300	2511780	Make sense?
2512060	2513140	Yeah, no, for sure.
2513300	2513780	For sure.
2513980	2517940	It was it was government subsidy to put a little bit more money into the entertainment
2517940	2518980	industry. I don't know.
2519020	2521220	That's that's a theory, a game theory.
2523140	2524540	Hey, now they didn't pay for that ad.
2525220	2526660	I know. I was joking.
2526660	2528340	That's called parody.
2528780	2530580	I know I can parody.
2532580	2535180	All right. But anyway, you see what my point was.
2535180	2536340	I do. I do know that.
2536340	2541660	And that's why. But my brain instantly went to, well, you'd have that, but you wouldn't
2541660	2542260	have this.
2543620	2548940	No, I imagine they pass some eight balls around, you know, I'm just saying, you know,
2548940	2550380	had a little line here and there.
2550380	2553460	No, I've talked to some of those game developers.
2553460	2555980	I know things, Rob.
2556060	2557340	Yeah, I know. I know.
2557740	2563300	So this is again, and the reason why I'm hesitant is as I don't want to sound like I'm
2563300	2566260	glamorizing it or endorsing it or any of that stuff.
2566260	2567420	I'm really not.
2567660	2573780	But I also realize it is a very harsh reality about how we got from point A to point Z.
2574620	2577500	So, yeah, no, right.
2577820	2581380	It just makes me it's sort of those what ifs.
2581580	2583100	No, I know. I get it. I get it.
2583460	2585940	All right. Anyway, let's move on.
2585940	2592260	Let's talk about our gaming weeks, whether it was, you know, affected by substances or
2592260	2593340	not. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
2593540	2594940	All right. How is your gaming?
2594940	2597260	I sure was. I went on a bender this weekend.
2598900	2600220	Dark Saga, how was your gaming week?
2600620	2602460	I played something other than Animal Crossing, Rob.
2603060	2603940	What?
2604540	2606060	Well, I did play Animal Crossing.
2606100	2609940	I mean, it's like the sufficient amount of my gaming time.
2610860	2615700	But I played around on the Switch online store just trying to, you know, I was looking
2615700	2617420	around to see what some of the SNES games were.
2617420	2620700	And I found one of my favorite little shooters on there was just Poppin' Twendy.
2621260	2626460	And I set it for wimp mode and just had a good time playing a couple of stages.
2626460	2628140	You know, I was like, oh, I remember this.
2628140	2634820	And then I remembered I sprained my thumb and so tapping repeatedly on that button to
2634820	2638260	fire my weapons, you know, and I was like trying to remember what color the bells did
2638260	2644740	what and realized that, you know, I don't like the the purple weapon as much as the
2644740	2647900	green weapon. And but I had I had a good time playing.
2647900	2649140	It was a sort of memories.
2649140	2654780	You know, this was back from when I would have my SNES emulator and would, you know,
2654780	2661100	download these ROMs because hello, who didn't and played, you know, these, you know.
2662060	2666980	Japanese SNES games that never, Super Famicom games that never got released in the US.
2667420	2671700	So there's a few others on there, there's Pano de Pon, which I might go back and play.
2673900	2678100	There's Mario P-Cross, which I'm not a P-Cross fan, but, you know, there was there's a
2678100	2682420	few other things on there that I was checking out and I might actually consider finishing
2682420	2688940	my run through of Mother, but I found my my GBA somewhere.
2689220	2690100	I don't know where it is now.
2690100	2698020	Again, it vanishes it unearths itself like, you know, Internet trolls, but I'm considering
2698020	2704380	playing my translated cart of Mother 3 because there's been like some discussion on it for
2704380	2707180	this. I don't know if we're going to have this in there.
2707180	2708260	I didn't see it in the show role.
2708260	2711460	I might have overlooked it, but there was a whole thing about how Nintendo doesn't want
2711460	2713740	to do games that evoke sadness.
2713740	2714580	You can get into it.
2714580	2719460	It that whole thing started like two minutes after I sent out the show role for tonight.
2719460	2721300	So it's it's breaking news, if you will.
2722060	2726860	Well, and one of one of my people I follow on there was saying, oh, now Mother 3 will
2726860	2732140	never come out on on the switch for any of the releases or anything like that.
2732140	2739820	And I was like, you know, maybe you're taking that out of context, but it did seem very.
2741020	2744300	It's like the toxic positivity thing, does that make sense?
2744460	2744900	Oh, yeah.
2745780	2751860	And I'm like, you if you deny the bad that happens in your life, you can't appreciate
2751860	2755500	the good as much or you're compartmentalizing it, you're not dealing with it.
2755780	2760460	And I think Nintendo, given the fact that the games that they've had that have a vote
2760460	2764420	for those emotions, do it so well and relatively safely.
2765540	2770580	I think that that was a poor choice of something to say, does that make sense?
2770700	2770980	Yep.
2771220	2773580	Toxic positivity is what I call James Corden.
2774540	2775180	Who?
2775820	2776300	It's fine.
2777740	2782980	OK, if that's a TV thing, I don't get it because I only watch Supernatural and it's
2782980	2783300	gone.
2783420	2783820	Kinda.
2783820	2784260	It's all right.
2784980	2786180	Anything else for your gaming week?
2789100	2789740	Words.
2790300	2790620	No.
2791820	2792180	All right.
2792940	2793980	Loki, how was your gaming week?
2795220	2795980	It was OK.
2795980	2799580	So I started off working on my game.
2799780	2806100	I've been trying to research how to do animated tiles and haven't had a lot of luck.
2806220	2813180	I did manage to create a really irritating flashing screen that animated tiles, but it's
2813180	2814340	not the right way to do it.
2814820	2819620	And so it's been a lot of research this week, not a whole lot being made in the game,
2819620	2821820	just more just figuring out how to do stuff.
2822540	2826180	But I'm realizing I'm getting to the point where, you know, I don't know if it's going
2826180	2828620	to I'm going to figure it out.
2828860	2829820	There is a way to do it.
2829820	2831980	I just don't know how code wise.
2831980	2835940	So I'll have to research some more, but I am probably going to work some more on the
2835940	2837340	actual game and other parts.
2837780	2843980	And then I've been playing some more Minecraft with my kids.
2843980	2846060	So we've been playing on our realm.
2846060	2849180	I've been trying to fix with some of the last updates I've done.
2850100	2855860	It's broken some of my plugins a little bit, so I was trying to reload some stuff and
2855860	2863700	update things, but man, like realms on Minecraft, they're just janky as hell.
2863700	2872780	So they really don't respond well to updating plugins that are in there or add ons into
2872780	2873260	the game.
2873340	2879580	So you have to, I don't know, like I've tried so many times just to like add one more
2879580	2883500	plugin on there and I've removed like several of them, but it's just sometimes they'll
2883500	2887220	just time out or refuse to load or whatever the case may be.
2887220	2896740	So it's, it's just been a struggle, but still built the castle and helped my son with
2896740	2898060	some redstone stuff.
2898340	2900460	So we've been just doing that, just messing around.
2900860	2901220	Nice.
2901780	2903820	And a little bit of hornet.
2904820	2906340	How's Pixel Poops coming along?
2907260	2911180	Well, that's what I was saying, you know, with Pixel Poops, I've been just researching
2911180	2919900	how to do animated tiles in the nest because it's a lot harder than I, well, everything's
2919900	2928380	hard with the NES, but so I was trying to find a way to just up, you know, reload tile
2928380	2928980	sets and stuff.
2928980	2932140	So they'd swap it out, but it takes too long to do that.
2932380	2935940	And so that's where I was getting that weird flickering effect.
2935980	2939420	I think I posted it on Twitter just to show like the animated tiles.
2939460	2945420	Maybe I just mentioned it, but so now there's another method that you can do that, which
2945420	2947060	is updating the name table.
2947060	2949780	But in order to do that, I have to read from the name table.
2949780	2956340	And that's also tricky as well, because it's in the the picture processing unit when you're
2956340	2956780	doing that.
2956780	2961780	It's just, it's so complicated, but I may just give up on the animated tiles and just
2961780	2963900	move on with creating more assets for the game.
2964780	2970020	So I'll probably end up doing that and the other things I want to implement.
2970020	2972260	But I really would like animated tiles.
2972260	2975340	It would really look nice, but leave it and come back to it later.
2975340	2977820	You know, maybe I'll have a breakthrough somewhere else that leads to that.
2977940	2979020	That's what I've been doing.
2979020	2983900	It's just been just trying to understand how things work in the NES and how it loads up
2983900	2984420	and everything.
2984420	2987620	So but yeah, I'll come back to it probably.
2988020	2990220	OK, my gaming week.
2990220	2992540	So nothing really new.
2992540	2995740	I've been continuing on with a lot of things I've been talking about here on the show,
2996180	2998060	continuing on with Dragon Quest 11.
2998820	3003820	I'm even further into that game, probably like 25 hours in at this point, getting making
3003820	3004460	progress on that.
3005220	3010660	And then I was playing quite a bit of Pokemon Go slash Ingress slash Orna, like all the GPS
3010660	3010900	games.
3010900	3014980	I was doing a lot of that yesterday just because, you know, it's Saturday.
3014980	3017420	I didn't have much to do, so I was like, well, let me go walking.
3017420	3019220	I'm going to go on some hikes, some adventure.
3019460	3023180	I'm going to go get some hard to get portals that take, you know, like one of them.
3023180	3027700	I had to do like a mile and a half walk in a mile, half walk back, you know, but that's the
3027700	3030260	type of stuff where I needed the motivation.
3030900	3036700	And then, of course, since I was doing Pokemon Go with that, I was like, I don't think I
3036700	3038020	should do this Mr.
3038020	3041940	Rhyme event because they want eight bucks so you can catch a particular.
3042140	3047620	But I did it because I'm a sucker and consumer whore and how Mr.
3047620	3052660	Consumer Whore and but I was like, you know what, I'm so bored and this is like a little
3052660	3055380	incentive to go outside and do some stuff and walk around.
3055380	3056660	And I do like Mr.
3056660	3056980	Rhyme.
3056980	3057660	He's really funny.
3058420	3063900	So I was like, whatever, even though I'm sure he will be obtainable in the game in like three
3063900	3067580	months because that's what they did with Genesect and some of the other releases that they did
3067580	3068420	in a similar way.
3069020	3071500	But but but I also don't know because Mr.
3071500	3078820	Rhyme, the base one from Gen one has been a region exclusive to the UK, and we haven't been
3078820	3083780	able to get that here until they did an event here at one point where you were able to get that
3083780	3087620	and Kangaskhan, like you're able to get all the exclusives pretty easy during that event.
3088220	3091260	Yeah, you probably played during that event or maybe you traded whatever.
3092020	3096980	But I don't know if they're going to maybe do the Galarian one differently when they release it
3096980	3097500	or what.
3097740	3099500	So, yeah.
3099500	3101300	So I was like, whatever.
3101300	3105660	I didn't feel great about endorsing Niantic doing that, but I was really bored.
3105660	3106620	So forgive me.
3108060	3111100	Otherwise, how many things do you get away with just because you're bored?
3112140	3112700	Murder?
3113340	3114180	Why did you kill him?
3114180	3114940	I was bored.
3115300	3115620	All right.
3117060	3117980	But a serious note.
3117980	3123780	So kind of speaking of Pokemon, I think I talked about this on a previous episode, but like I kind of
3123780	3125380	played even more of it this week.
3125380	3127940	I've been playing a lot of Pokemon Shield.
3128180	3131260	My save file is up to almost 60 hours at this point.
3131420	3137940	And that's because of Pokemon Home and kind of unveiling that central dex kind of motivated me to.
3138100	3143140	And here's the shocking thing about this whole like Rob is suddenly super into the Pokemon
3143140	3143980	mainline games.
3144460	3145900	This isn't a shame thing.
3146180	3149460	And this might shock you like, wait, wait, wait.
3149540	3151220	He didn't bully you into this somehow?
3151220	3156420	No, like, actually, I don't think he really believes that it's happening.
3157420	3162860	In some ways, but my dex in Shield is up to like 310.
3163300	3168300	At this point, I have a spreadsheet tracking everything I need to get and how I get it and the
3168300	3171940	ones I need to level up and the ones I need to trade with somebody.
3172060	3177540	I've been using Pokemon Home to do some of the trades like Lunatone is in Shield, but
3177540	3178900	Solrock is in Sword.
3179020	3184500	So I traded that in Home and you even get stickers for doing some of that stuff for your
3184500	3185140	profile.
3185140	3190580	And so it's I don't know what finally set me off on the mainline Pokemon games.
3191980	3198940	But I guess Home and Quarantine and Pokemon Go kind of affecting the mainline games that
3198940	3204620	regard kind of all just suddenly gave me this incentive where I'm like, I am going to
3204620	3205420	catch them all.
3205940	3206620	Yes, I am.
3206620	3207860	Just like I'm going to do it.
3207860	3209860	I'm going to catch them all this time.
3210660	3212060	So that's what I've been working on.
3212220	3214580	No DLC until I catch them all.
3214820	3215660	That is my rule.
3216700	3221180	So maybe in a couple of weeks on the show, once I've caught them all, I will get into the
3221180	3222700	DLC and all that stuff.
3222900	3224580	So, all right.
3224700	3225300	But that's yeah.
3225300	3226820	So I've been spending a lot of time on Pokemon.
3228220	3228940	Weird, right?
3229460	3229900	All right.
3230660	3231140	Let's see.
3231300	3235660	Sia Tabiri in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says, Rob, catch him right here, folks.
3235980	3237140	I guess.
3237380	3239460	I mean, it only took how many years?
3240460	3244860	Isn't Pokemon having like its 20th anniversary, no, 25th anniversary right now.
3245500	3246020	All right.
3246700	3248580	Anyway, let's move on.
3248620	3250220	We got a lot of news to get into.
3250220	3252260	We've been talking a lot, so let's get to it.
3252260	3254900	Loki, other big news and announcements this week.
3255580	3255940	Yeah.
3255940	3260900	So they had this cool Nintendo Direct covering the Indies again.
3260900	3267020	So this Indie World Showcase and during their like 15 minute live stream, they had, uh,
3267780	3269980	several different games that they talked about.
3270380	3275700	So some of the more notable stuff, obviously, uh, we had a Super Meat Boy Forever.
3275700	3279860	It's going to be, uh, exclusive to the Switch on December 23rd.
3280380	3287940	Uh, also there was, um, Fist of Fluffs, which is a physics based, uh,
3287940	3289140	cat fighting game.
3289140	3290180	So that was kind of fun.
3290580	3297780	Um, there's also a course, uh, very, very valet, which reminds me of like those,
3297820	3305860	um, how like the, the cooking games that they have, um, where it's like a cooking
3305860	3310420	party game, so that's supposed to be coming out early 2021, like overcooked
3310460	3314620	those games, yeah, like overcooked, but like parking it's like that.
3314620	3319300	Or, um, there was another one with also like moving, um, boxes and stuff.
3319700	3324180	It's a similar type of kind of, uh, chaotic, uh, four player co-op type thing.
3324380	3326900	So that's, uh, a valet game that's going to be coming out.
3327340	3333220	And, um, Cyber Shadow, which looks a little like, it looks like it took a
3333220	3337460	little too many cues from Ninja Gaiden, but it's like a cyberpunk, uh, Ninja
3337460	3340580	Gaiden game, and that's coming out, uh, January 26th.
3340900	3343700	There was, there was another game I played recently cause it was on, is
3343700	3344700	it the last messenger?
3344700	3345380	Is that the game?
3345820	3348140	There's some game on a Xbox game pass.
3348460	3352900	It's it is straight up, not even shy that it's like a Ninja Gaiden game.
3352940	3353140	Yeah.
3353140	3355500	Well that one, that one's like a Ninja Gaiden game.
3355500	3361420	This one, like the sprites look almost identical and the cut scenes really
3361420	3363300	resemble the original cut scenes.
3363340	3368940	In fact, like I would almost say that they were copied, but it's not, it's,
3368940	3374300	it's very like, like if you were, if you were to show someone that in like,
3375300	3378540	they may think it's a Ninja Gaiden sequel, like from the original NES.
3378540	3378860	But anyways.
3378860	3381060	And Act F says it is the messenger.
3381300	3382060	I added another one.
3382060	3382940	Yeah, the messenger.
3382940	3383140	Yeah.
3383140	3383740	I remember that one.
3383740	3386180	So, um, what else?
3386460	3392740	Of course, uh, the very big announcement was that, uh, that Among
3392740	3396620	Us is going to be out that day on the Switch.
3396700	3398020	So that's pretty cool.
3398500	3401220	Um, some other cool stuff that they're showing off as well.
3401340	3403020	Uh, going back to Cyber Shadow real quick.
3403020	3408540	So, um, if you scan your amiibo for Shovel Knight, it also adds like a power
3408540	3409820	up to the game, which is kind of neat.
3410460	3416660	They showed off also, uh, this game called Alba, the wildlife adventure,
3416780	3422220	which is kind of more of like a calming, uh, you know, not Pokemon snap, but it's
3422220	3423700	a game where you take pictures of wildlife.
3423780	3425740	I know there's like another game they're showing off for like the
3425740	3427220	PlayStation four is kind of similar.
3427620	3430580	So there's that, um, yeah.
3431260	3431460	Yeah.
3431460	3434900	So lots of cool indie games that were being shown off there.
3435660	3441060	And, uh, uh, Tunchi, or I think that's how to spell that Tucci or Tunchi, uh, which
3441060	3447580	was a 2d beat him up game that's set in the Amazon reinforce also has, um, the
3447580	3449500	character from hat and time in there as well.
3449940	3457500	And yeah, so lots of cool stuff to be, I mean, I like how they do showcase their
3457500	3461980	Indies every, almost every month or every few months, at least every month, we're
3461980	3465860	getting one of those and the, the among us thing of course, was, was big news
3465860	3467780	because, uh, you know, just how big that game is.
3468100	3472460	Um, it is kind of interesting though, that even they kind of suggest that, you
3472460	3474660	know, you use a voice chat app.
3474980	3475940	To use it, which is interesting.
3475940	3478860	They don't even say use the Nintendo app and probably because they don't
3478860	3482380	let the third parties use the direct Nintendo app to do voice chatting.
3482660	3485260	Um, but they suggest using a voice chat app.
3485580	3487860	I wonder if it's interesting cross-play.
3488540	3492620	I, I don't know what they have this version coming out and then there's
3492620	3494380	the one that's on games fast.
3494660	3499020	I wonder if this is all cross-play like PC and, uh, I think PC and Android
3499020	3502180	and stuff are all cross-play as well.
3502500	3503220	As far as I know.
3503220	3503540	Yes.
3503540	3503900	I'm waiting.
3503900	3507100	I'm hoping somebody in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network will let us
3507100	3509900	know because I do see a couple of people are saying that they picked up the game
3509900	3510740	on switch this week.
3510740	3512860	So I'm curious if they played with people on PC.
3513060	3514900	I don't see why it wouldn't be cross-play.
3515140	3515580	Uh, okay.
3515580	3517300	And act F confirming it is cross-play.
3517700	3518260	Oh, that's good.
3518500	3519300	Yeah, that's very good.
3521100	3521540	All right.
3522020	3525460	Um, so moving on, let's talk about some other big news that came out this
3525460	3530340	week because it's not often you see Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft all
3530340	3532220	coming together to make a statement.
3532460	3536020	So this was everybody getting together to make one statement.
3536020	3537860	Now, how often do you get that in the gaming industry?
3537860	3538860	Not very often.
3539060	3541140	And that's kind of what made this newsworthy.
3541380	3546540	Now, uh, it was posted on the official X-Box website, the X-Box, uh, newswire.
3546820	3551140	Um, so I don't know if that indicates that they started the conversation or what.
3551340	3555220	It could also just be that they have, you know, um, the, or they were the first to
3555220	3556660	get out the press release or whatever.
3556660	3557140	I don't know.
3557460	3562460	But anyway, uh, it is a statement basically about, uh, kind of reaffirming
3562460	3564660	that, uh, gaming is for everybody.
3565060	3570260	And we need to basically take efforts to have a shared commitment to safer gaming
3570260	3570860	for everybody.
3570900	3573980	So that was kind of nice to see coming from all of those companies.
3574180	3578500	Um, so it was a very long, uh, kind of, uh, statement with this, but it was nice to
3578500	3579500	see them all come together.
3579700	3582260	Let me try to get some of the highlights from this statement here.
3582620	3586580	We believe gaming is for people of all ages, including our youngest and most
3586580	3587500	vulnerable players.
3587780	3590820	Technology makes compelling entertainment experiences possible, and we want to
3590820	3594500	ensure that those experiences, especially when they involve interaction with others
3594500	3596460	are positive and respectful.
3596980	3602220	Um, at Xbox, we are aligned with both Nintendo on behalf of the community of
3602220	3606220	Switch players and PlayStation in our belief that protecting players online
3606220	3610660	requires a multi multidisciplinary approach, one that combines the benefits
3610660	3614860	of advanced technology, a supportive community, and skilled human oversight.
3615260	3619380	We can accomplish more when we work toward the same goal, and so we will each
3619380	3623660	continue investing in evolving and amplifying our approaches to user safety.
3624060	3627860	As we continue this work, we will prioritize protecting the safety of our
3627860	3630020	players, especially those most vulnerable.
3630300	3633460	And then they get into principles that will guide their work.
3633460	3638620	The first one is prevention, letting players control or letting, uh, providing
3638620	3641420	controls that will let players customize their gaming experience.
3641740	3646700	Uh, safety features have to be easy to use, inform play parents and players
3646700	3650740	through code of conduct, terms of use, investing in technology to thwart
3650740	3651780	improper conduct.
3651780	3654220	I'm very much summarizing these bullet points for time.
3654620	3658620	Uh, partnership, uh, partnering with the industry regulators and law
3658620	3663540	enforcement, uh, reinforcing a commitment to safety, um, working with industry
3663540	3667820	trade organizations, including and law enforcement and experts, uh, for advanced
3667820	3672660	online safety initiatives, uh, shared research between the big three, for the
3672660	3676860	better of the industry, we believe that hate and harassment or exploitation of
3676860	3679540	younger players in any way have no place in gaming.
3680220	3682420	Um, and then responsibility.
3682420	3686540	We will hold ourselves accountable for making our platforms as safe as possible
3686540	3690820	for all players, making it easy for players to report violations of the code
3690820	3695620	of conduct and removing content and enforcement actions for violation,
3695940	3702180	complying with local laws, publishing rules and requirements, and, um, basically
3702180	3707780	re-restating that the partnership of to work together, uh, is, is going to help
3708100	3712500	everybody and, and protect, uh, children and so forth, uh, and that working
3712500	3714020	together, they'll accomplish more than alone.
3714980	3719380	So then why don't they also take the same approach and apply it toward, uh, their
3719380	3723460	studios, toward their employees, treating other employees properly and making a
3723460	3724420	safe working environment?
3725540	3726820	Uh, great question.
3726820	3732820	And I think to be fair, I feel like, uh, specifically Microsoft who put out this
3732820	3737500	original release, I feel like, and unfortunately I don't have the, the press
3737500	3741260	release to back, I feel like they have made that kind of commitment previously.
3741500	3744940	And when we hear about some of these, uh, studios that are, you know, work to the
3744940	3747900	bonus, it's not usually coming out of Microsoft.
3748300	3755260	Um, and some of the Sony stuff too, but then of course we all heard about the,
3755500	3760460	the last of us part two crunch time, but that was naughty dog who is not, are they
3760460	3760940	specific?
3760940	3762060	Are they owned by Sony?
3763260	3767420	But my, my thought is I get what you're saying though, but beyond that, not
3767420	3769980	just internal in their studios, but the fact that they work with some of these
3769980	3775980	studios that have some atrocious, uh, gender issues and, uh, just bigotry in
3775980	3776860	their studios.
3776860	3782060	Um, I would think that they would also want to apply that standard to, uh, well,
3782060	3787580	if they were being truly adhering to that standard, that they would want to also,
3787580	3793340	uh, not work with companies until they've also committed to it in house and out of
3793340	3793660	house.
3793660	3794620	Does that make sense?
3794620	3795180	Yeah.
3795180	3797260	And Bob coffee confirming they are Sony owned.
3797260	3798940	Sorry, I'm having a brain fog moment.
3798940	3803820	I'm just, I'm kind of, why don't they fall under that same, but anyway, forget it.
3803820	3809020	Um, some also some folks in chat noting that swap note got an update this week,
3809020	3812540	which is relevant to the conversation because Nintendo had patched that because
3812540	3815180	of the whole, you know, kids getting exposed to stuff.
3815180	3815980	So weird.
3815980	3817580	So yeah, no, I'm with you, dark soccer.
3817580	3821100	This, this strikes me as a, um, this is, this is nice.
3821660	3823420	This is a nice message.
3823420	3827260	This is, this is a good, um, guiding principles document.
3827900	3830780	Now back it up right now.
3830780	3835100	Now, you know, show the action that backs it up, that it's not just words,
3835660	3839820	but it is nice that the three of them are, are putting a unified front on this.
3839820	3840460	That's for sure.
3840460	3841580	Cause you don't see that every day.
3842380	3843100	I'll give it that.
3844940	3845260	All right.
3845900	3848460	Well, with, with that, let's move on to our next story.
3849260	3850700	Speaking of kids, kinda.
3851420	3855900	Well, um, China has made some changes.
3855900	3860060	They didn't really have a formal age rating system for video games.
3860060	3865420	Whereas here in the U S and in Canada, we've had ESRB and, uh, Europe has
3865420	3868060	had the Peggy system PGI.
3868620	3875180	And so they have a new system that was, uh, put together by, uh, I believe
3875820	3881820	Nico partners that is, uh, one of six measures proposed by the China
3881820	3884220	state administration of press and publications.
3884860	3889420	Um, I'll go into the other proposals in a moment, but this system is
3889420	3893340	supposed to strengthen their current regulation, uh, uh, around minors
3893340	3895100	to prevent video game addiction.
3895660	3899580	So now they have, um, and it's been through 41 revisions according to this.
3899580	3904540	So, uh, it looks like they are being rated eight plus, which is green 12
3904540	3906940	plus blue 16 plus yellow.
3906940	3909740	The 18 plus rating is gone.
3910620	3911820	We don't know what happened to it.
3911820	3914540	I think it graduated and left the house.
3916380	3920940	But at any rate, um, uh, publishers have to display the relevant age
3920940	3925740	rating on the game's website, the login screen and other materials,
3925740	3928140	including box art manuals, stuff like that.
3928940	3934060	Um, now in other news, um, and this kind of goes along with it.
3934860	3939020	Um, other proposals that have gone with this are real name identification
3939020	3941900	systems, which we know how the fuck that works for people.
3942540	3949340	Um, playtime cap for minors, uh, the limit spending that a minor can,
3949340	3953260	can spend in online games, uh, other options to work with parents and
3953260	3955820	schools, and then working with local regulators.
3956780	3963980	So, um, the quote, uh, that the, uh, analyst firm, uh, said is that, uh,
3963980	3968300	they don't expect any measures to have quote a material impact on game
3968300	3972220	publisher earnings and growth, especially since miners are a lower
3972220	3973500	percentage of spenders.
3974380	3977820	Yeah, but who buys the games for the miners?
3979100	3979660	Just saying.
3979820	3985100	So, yeah, it's, it's interesting to see how it plays out.
3985100	3992140	I mean, in China also has a fairly, um, stringent system anyway, especially
3992140	3994300	with how they censor things.
3994940	4000700	Um, I guess it might make more sense for there.
4000700	4005660	I, you know, and I don't, I, I certainly understand wanting to, um, do playtime
4005660	4010940	caps to limit the spending, but should that not be the parent's job?
4012380	4018300	But then again, China has a lot more hands-on approach to, uh, their
4018300	4018860	population.
4018860	4019360	Mm-hmm.
4021900	4024940	I was, I was interested, I thought it was interesting.
4024940	4029820	They didn't already have a rating system similar to, you know, yeah, they did.
4029820	4031820	It just wasn't an official system.
4031820	4034300	It was like a suggestion.
4035100	4036620	Like a suggested system.
4036620	4037120	Got it.
4037580	4042940	So, well, technically, I guess technically the, the stuff we see with the ratings here
4042940	4047340	isn't like a government mandated system, but it was a system that the industry had
4047340	4050860	to come up with or else the government was going to come up with its own system,
4050860	4053900	which we know would have been terrible because it was the government's.
4053900	4056620	So it was, yeah, it was kind of that sort of situation.
4056620	4061500	So technically the rating system we have here is kind of unofficial, but then I guess
4061500	4065500	we've also tried to see where they've built laws around it too.
4065500	4067260	It's industry official.
4067260	4071340	So I do consider it to be official, just not federally mandated.
4071340	4071840	Yeah.
4072860	4076700	However, there wasn't any sort of uniform system.
4076700	4079260	They had like, I believe it was a generalized system.
4079260	4082780	Maybe it was a little bit more uniform, but I think now they are working specifically
4082780	4087900	with the government because we've seen other stories come out of Japan with, you
4087900	4093180	know, gaming cafes and kids, you know, spending their parents' money and other
4093180	4093980	things like that.
4093980	4100220	And, you know, I know that, of course, under that regime, they've got many
4100220	4104060	different, I'm trying to be as diplomatic about this as possible.
4104060	4104620	I gotcha.
4105260	4112300	Different things culturally and legislatively that are playing into a decision to have
4112300	4114060	this be nationally mandated.
4114060	4114560	Yeah.
4116060	4117660	And, and I don't live there.
4118540	4123900	I don't really know many people who live in China who are gamers who operate under these systems.
4123900	4130380	You know, I have personally seen an IQ once in my life, in real life, which we know what
4130380	4131020	IQ is.
4131020	4133820	It was Nintendo's way of releasing games in China.
4135420	4141260	But overall, it's, I mean, maybe it's a good thing.
4141260	4141820	We'll see.
4141820	4149660	I mean, I think that the over here, if parents actually paid attention to the ESRB ratings,
4150460	4153340	then there'd be probably fewer complaints.
4156780	4158780	But, but I don't know.
4159420	4162140	We'll see if we have any listeners in China.
4162140	4166700	I don't know if we do or how, let us know how, how the system works over there.
4166700	4168620	I'd be very curious to know more about it.
4169340	4169840	For sure.
4170700	4171200	All right.
4171680	4175360	Well, let's move on to some big changes over here.
4175360	4175860	Loki.
4176560	4177060	Yeah.
4177760	4183520	So apparently there was, um, Codemasters was looking to be purchased and originally they
4183520	4187680	had a bid from Take-Two Interactive last month for $1 billion.
4187680	4194880	Well, EA has swooped in and now, uh, purchased or made the agreement to purchase of the company
4194880	4196160	for $1.2 billion.
4197760	4200720	Of course, that would bring in a lot of racing series to EA.
4201200	4208960	But then again, it's also EA who they just, they just go in there and just fleece it dry
4208960	4215120	and stuff it full of microtransactions before they finally kill off the actual company.
4215120	4217600	So, all right.
4217600	4221680	Well, apparently though, uh, it's supposed to, the acquisition is supposed to be completed
4221680	4224000	by the first quarter of 2021.
4224000	4228640	Um, and of course that'll give them a lot more racing games under their belt, aside
4228640	4233600	from of course, Need for Speed and, um, Burnout.
4233600	4234100	So.
4235280	4235780	Cool.
4236720	4237220	Yeah.
4237680	4239280	Don't know what else to say on that one.
4239280	4242720	It's kind of one of those hope it goes well for Codemasters.
4242720	4246240	I mean, certainly it'll get their games out there, I think for broader and there's going
4246240	4249360	to be a lot more of a, uh, marketing and ad budget.
4249360	4252560	Not to say that didn't exist, but I think, you know, with, with as huge of a company
4252560	4255760	as EA is, um, there will definitely be a big boost with that.
4255760	4260400	And I guess if you want to look at it a certain way, that means more Codemasters stuff will
4260400	4263840	show up on EA Play, which in turn will go to Game Pass.
4263840	4266960	Although I think a lot of the Codemasters stuff is already on Game Pass anyway, but,
4266960	4268320	you know, kind of interesting.
4269280	4269780	Whatever.
4270640	4272400	It, it is what it is.
4273680	4274180	All right.
4274800	4277920	Well, let's move on and talk about, I think this is cool.
4277920	4282000	Um, I don't know how many of you guys saw that direct this week of the Super Nintendo
4282000	4283440	World theme park.
4283440	4290160	So Miyamoto actually went out and showed over in Japan at, uh, uh, the, the, um, universal
4290160	4292720	studios out there, what this new land is going to look like.
4292720	4294160	And it looks really cool.
4294160	4297840	Now I know you probably guys would expect me to play this on Twitch, but, um, remember
4297840	4301120	we are trying to record a podcast and I know there's many folks that listen to the audio
4301120	4302000	throughout the week.
4302000	4303760	So I didn't want to detract from that too much.
4303760	4307440	I will just urge everybody to check out this direct, um, when you can get a chance.
4307440	4311600	It was posted on December 18th called the Super Nintendo World Direct.
4311600	4313840	And it looks like really cool.
4313840	4317760	And it is interesting to hearing them talk about some of the things that had to be considered
4317760	4321280	for, um, the world that maybe they didn't have to think about before.
4321280	4324880	Like, what does the inside of a warp pipe look like?
4324880	4326720	They've never really shown that before.
4326720	4330720	I think maybe it was represented in some of the cartoons and stuff, but that isn't really
4330720	4331600	canon.
4331600	4334160	Um, so what is the inside of a warp pipe look like?
4334800	4335040	Yeah.
4335040	4338240	So they actually show looking at the Kenopios pictures.
4338240	4339920	Oh, have you not seen this yet?
4339920	4340480	Oh, it's so good.
4340480	4345920	I've seen some of it, but I'm actually looking at just some of the, the pictures I've seen
4345920	4348240	a lot of the pictures that were posted on Twitter, but yeah.
4348240	4348480	Yeah.
4349120	4351680	A lot of these are just ridiculously cute.
4351680	4353840	And, um, I would get on a plane for this.
4353840	4354080	Yeah.
4354080	4358560	It's really that attention to detail that is really stunning with this whole thing.
4358560	4362320	Uh, and technically dark soccer, you don't really have to get on a plane because this
4362320	4367680	world will be coming to universal studios, um, in Hollywood, as well as the park in Orlando,
4367680	4368240	Florida.
4368240	4372720	So kind of like, um, how, when they got the rights to Harry Potter, they did the wizarding
4372720	4373600	world in Florida.
4373600	4377600	They did one in, um, LA and I think Japan has one of those too.
4377600	4380560	So it's kind of that concept, um, with this.
4380560	4382240	So all the parks right now.
4382880	4383360	Oh yeah.
4383360	4384720	It's not a good time.
4384720	4386480	No, now is not a good time for theme parks.
4386480	4391440	I mean, it looks very limited in size, but I know that's the same with the wizarding
4391440	4392400	world of Harry Potter.
4392400	4394960	There's like maybe one or two attractions there.
4394960	4396720	And then that's it, which is kind of disappointing.
4396720	4402000	If it's super Nintendo world, it's like, well, it's Mario and Mario and done.
4402000	4403840	There's no room to put anything else.
4403840	4408160	Also with the wizard world, it's different in Florida than it is in Hollywood.
4408160	4411520	And I kind of think it sounds like Florida has the better version because they have more
4411520	4412020	rides.
4412560	4416720	Um, but they also have more real, they, they ha they have a boatload of real estate to
4416720	4417600	play with in Florida.
4417600	4420080	That's why there's like five Disney parks in Florida.
4420080	4425120	And in the, in the U S and Anaheim, it's always like, what are we going to lose to
4425120	4426080	get something new?
4426080	4430480	Like, yes, they're building a whole Avengers section in a Disney California adventure,
4430480	4431360	but guess what?
4431360	4435600	The bugs life stuff is gone now because they had to take something out.
4435600	4436720	Nothing was lost.
4436720	4441840	Nothing of value was, well, there was that, there was that train with all the sense.
4441840	4442340	Yeah.
4442720	4443220	Yeah.
4443520	4444240	There's that too.
4444240	4444740	Yeah.
4444880	4445760	Hey, you know what?
4445760	4450800	I still found, uh, I found my, uh, video that I took of them singing happy trails and it
4450800	4451920	makes me sad.
4451920	4452420	Yeah.
4453280	4458640	Well, and, and Bobby, um, made a comment in chat saying now is the best time for theme
4458640	4460800	parks to be building new experiences.
4460800	4461300	Yes.
4461300	4462880	Um, this is a great time.
4462880	4463120	Yeah.
4463120	4463440	Building.
4463440	4463940	Yes.
4464400	4471200	Um, opening, not so much, but by the time this gets to California, you know, we're talking
4471200	4474560	at this point, 2022, maybe 2023.
4474560	4478640	And I think theme parks will be back on the table for discussion when we get that far
4478640	4480880	out, hopefully they go, Oh God, I hope so.
4481520	4482400	So anyway,
4482400	4485280	I'm curious to see though what the new, uh, Mario Kart ride is.
4485280	4491120	Cause it kind of briefly touched on it that it's got like some AR component to it.
4491120	4495440	Um, but they didn't really show if it's like a rollercoaster or if it's like kind of one
4495440	4500640	of those, just motion rides, not like motion ride, but like, you know, trackless motion
4500640	4501680	ride, I guess.
4501760	4503600	Um, or something like that.
4503600	4504160	I don't know.
4504720	4507360	You know, maybe it is a rollercoaster.
4507360	4507840	I don't know.
4510160	4512720	Oh, think cars like California adventure.
4514000	4514800	I guess.
4514800	4515600	Yeah.
4515600	4516100	Yeah.
4517600	4518560	That'd be cool.
4518560	4519040	Yeah.
4519040	4519680	That'd be fun.
4520480	4523120	Especially if you get to throw red shells at people, that'll be the best part.
4524000	4524480	Yeah.
4524480	4524800	All right.
4525360	4526320	I'm moving on.
4526320	4528800	Let's get the spin out when you get hit with the red shell.
4530480	4531120	Blue shells.
4531120	4533440	It just sends everyone to the back of the line to get into the ride.
4534160	4538800	Um, another thing that's at those theme parks at universal is the Simpsons ride.
4538800	4543120	Cause the one in a Hollywood, uh, replaced that back to the future ride.
4543120	4546240	I don't know if you guys remember that from when we were really young, but, uh, yeah.
4546240	4548080	Now they have that Simpsons ride.
4548080	4550240	Um, and that one, I like that ride.
4550240	4550960	That one's really fun.
4550960	4554400	But what makes that ride is like the whole queue and every, there's so many jokes leading
4554400	4554800	up to it.
4554800	4555680	It's great.
4555680	4558640	But, um, dark soccer has some Simpsons related news, right?
4559440	4560240	I do.
4560240	4564080	And not only is it Simpsons news, it's Dreamcast news.
4564080	4566080	You know, I love me some Dreamcast.
4566080	4566400	Same.
4567680	4574320	So, um, there, um, there was a, uh, a dev kit that was found.
4574320	4580000	Apparently it was a, uh, broken Dreamcast dev kits hard drive that had this.
4580560	4585200	And it looks like as a playable demo for a game called the Simpsons bug squad.
4586080	4594800	Um, so as far as we can tell from this video, um, you're playing as a bug and the Simpsons
4594800	4595920	are walking around.
4595920	4604800	Um, it was a tech demo, but at any rate, it, it was supposed to be though, for a title
4604800	4607760	that was called Simpsons bug squad, I think it's just, you know, setting it up.
4607760	4614640	It was, uh, by, uh, red lemon studios who is no longer among the, the living.
4614640	4620080	Um, and it actually, I mean, for the demo, it looked really good.
4620080	4621280	It was all cell shaded.
4621280	4622480	It looked very much like the show.
4622480	4628960	I mean, if it's just, you know, cell shaded, non textured, uh, 3d, then that wouldn't really
4628960	4631040	have been too difficult for the Dreamcast to do.
4632000	4633920	Um, but it looks pretty cool.
4633920	4635440	I watched a little bit of the video.
4636080	4640640	There are, uh, tools out there to learn how to make it playable.
4640640	4644320	So you can check it out for the places that still probably have it up.
4644880	4646720	Um, but it looks pretty cool.
4646720	4654160	Um, and I just like when we find more things, uh, little tidbits on these development systems
4654160	4659920	that people pick up for a song that are able to pull, uh, games out like that or demos
4659920	4660240	like that.
4660240	4663600	I just think it's pretty cool stuff, you know, what could have been.
4663600	4669680	And the guy said that there was some additional, uh, tech demos on there from that same developer.
4669680	4674320	So it's exciting to see what other things they have considering that they were working
4674320	4677840	on a lot of games, uh, developed for Fox interactive.
4677840	4679680	So it'd be interesting.
4679680	4685680	And even that like tech demo of the Simpsons game, that looked really good for like a Dreamcast
4685680	4685920	game.
4685920	4689840	Like that's, you know, I don't know, it's pretty solid.
4689920	4692480	Did genuinely have really good looking games.
4693200	4699680	Um, I mean, yeah, every, every system has its, you know, steaming turds, but in this
4699680	4705840	case, um, I, it, especially for a game that's, that's a cell shaded game like this.
4706720	4710960	That, um, you know, like I said, wouldn't have any major textures on it.
4710960	4715840	It, I would expect it to actually run pretty well in the Dreamcast, depending on, you know,
4715840	4719200	everything else trying to load in the game, but it looks, it looks, it looks fun.
4719200	4723600	It looks like it'd be, it would have been a really good, you know, fun outlet if ever
4723600	4725440	we'd gotten more goodies on the Dreamcast.
4726000	4726240	Yeah.
4727280	4727840	All right.
4727840	4733280	I, I, I'm a very similar to a dark Tetsuya in our chat who says, uh, love me some unreleased
4733280	4734080	game stories.
4734080	4735040	Hell yeah.
4735040	4740160	Over at twitch.tv slash vog network, uh, Zen monkey 11, following that up and in living
4740160	4743440	color RPG and married with children Sims like game.
4743440	4744880	Who knows what they may have been working on?
4744880	4747680	Maybe your fire, a Firefly game, right?
4747680	4748240	All right.
4748240	4753920	I'm still waiting for my, uh, my Jerry Seinfeld point and click game.
4753920	4756000	You know, that's supposed to be coming at some point.
4756880	4759040	Excuse me while I throw up in my mouth a little bit.
4759040	4760160	What's the clicking do?
4760160	4760660	Nothing.
4761680	4763280	No, it, it, it really is.
4763280	4767440	They remember they were making that Seinfeld, uh, point and click game that someone was
4767440	4767680	doing.
4767680	4768960	There's like a fan game.
4768960	4772480	He has, it's a fan game, not a, not an official product.
4772480	4772720	Yeah.
4773760	4777600	But I would like, I would just, I'd accept any TV show like that.
4778080	4780080	Married with children, uh, golden girls.
4780080	4780880	Why not?
4780880	4785520	You know, Bobby, uh, chimed in and said there was a homie D clown PC game in the nineties.
4785520	4790720	I saw that on one of y'all's, uh, games done quick marathon, whether it was awesome or
4790720	4790960	summer.
4790960	4793760	I don't remember what was one of the two, but that was in one of the marathons.
4793760	4797200	It was in the, um, uh, not great game block.
4797200	4798720	So I remember seeing that thing.
4798720	4798880	Yeah.
4798880	4800160	I remember seeing that thinking.
4800720	4803200	They had this game and I didn't own it somehow.
4803200	4805120	Cause I had a lot of crappy games in the nineties.
4805120	4805760	I'll tell you that.
4805840	4806800	So, okay.
4806800	4809920	It was this most recent summer games done quick says Bobby.
4809920	4811360	So interesting.
4812000	4812400	All right.
4812960	4815120	Uh, moving on, let's get to some more news.
4815120	4819040	Loki, this is, this is one of those things we should have seen coming.
4821360	4830080	Yeah, well, it, it is the M O of, uh, Epic games and Fortnite to, um, borrow.
4830080	4832400	Don't hold back from pop culture.
4832960	4840960	So they came out with a brand new totally original mode called the spy within.
4840960	4846720	And with the spy within it is a spinoff of their standard battle royale type game,
4846720	4854640	where you have to figure out who the imposters are and take your crew and try to complete tasks.
4855200	4858080	You can't talk to each other unless you call a meeting.
4858640	4861680	G what could they be possibly ripping off?
4862720	4865920	So yes, clearly, clearly inspired by among us.
4865920	4870400	It is, it looks incredibly cheap of them to do that.
4870400	4874160	But then again, if you think about it, Fortnite pretty much exists as.
4874160	4877840	You know, pub G was popular at the time and their original game Fortnite.
4878560	4880000	Didn't look all that popular.
4880000	4882000	Let's make a battle royale game out of it.
4882000	4882720	Hey, look at that.
4882720	4883840	It's popular.
4883840	4887680	So Fortnite didn't get popular until it ripped off pub G that's right.
4887680	4890160	Many people forget that wasn't supposed to be Fortnite.
4891120	4893520	Battle royale took over and became Fortnite,
4893520	4897760	but there was actually like a whole single player game that, you know, was like a survival game.
4897760	4898000	Yeah.
4898000	4900560	It was like cookie cutter, you know, like all the other shooters out there.
4905200	4908000	It wasn't like survival horror, but it had the building elements in it too,
4908000	4909600	which they just took from Minecraft.
4909600	4913040	So, you know, Fortnite is popular from stealing all these other ideas really.
4914000	4914640	So, yeah.
4914640	4920800	And then, of course, they also have they added a 120 hertz mode as well for
4922480	4925760	the newer consoles, so the Xbox Series X.
4925760	4934960	And then also you can also do like 1440p on Series X at 120 hertz and 1080p on the Series S.
4934960	4940240	And I think the PlayStation 5 also got an additional graphics mode as well.
4941200	4947920	And then also, of course, there is a house party video chat app that you can set up.
4948960	4950400	I guess they're using it.
4950400	4952640	Do they have like some investment in this or something?
4952640	4956720	Because I guess this is similar to like using Discord or something.
4956720	4959200	But I don't know.
4959200	4962320	It just is such a rip off.
4962320	4964320	I don't think this is going to be popular.
4964320	4967200	Honestly, it does seem like kind of just a cheap rip off.
4967520	4971600	And I think Among Us isn't all of a sudden going to become unpopular because of this.
4971600	4975680	But it's just that's just really low.
4975680	4978080	Well, I guess not for Epic Games.
4978080	4982240	Also unsurprising, though, like real talk, because haven't we been saying for long?
4982240	4984800	Oh, every game's got to put in a battle royale mode.
4984800	4988480	Every game is going to have this new battle royale thing until the next big thing comes along.
4988480	4991360	Who knows what the next big thing will be, but it'll show up someday.
4991360	4992720	And then every game is going to put that.
4992720	4999200	Oh, it's here, of course, with Among Us being one of the top 10 on Twitch pretty consistently
4999200	5005680	at this point, with very high profile people like AOC playing Among Us on her Twitch feed.
5005680	5009360	You know, this is this is a thing now.
5009360	5018400	So yeah, so I'm just I'm not surprised at all that this got ripped off.
5018400	5024320	And I think this also begs the question, what's going to be the next game to borrow from Among Us?
5024320	5028720	Are we going to get Super Mario imposter or what?
5029600	5030320	What game?
5030320	5031920	No, I know we don't.
5031920	5034160	We haven't done listless in a long time.
5034160	5035840	But if we did, that would be the game.
5035840	5037920	That would be the list I want to do right now.
5037920	5042400	Game that is most likely to implement an Among Us mode next.
5042960	5046400	Oh, I can tell you already what they would have what they would probably do.
5046400	5049120	It would be an obstacle course that game Fall Guys ish.
5049120	5051760	You know, like they would rip off Fall Guys, I think.
5052480	5052800	I don't know.
5052800	5053840	No, not for now.
5053840	5054400	Not what not.
5054400	5056560	What does Fortnite rip off next?
5056560	5059760	What is the next game to rip off Among Us?
5059760	5063440	Although that's a good answer to what will be the next game to like Call of Duty.
5065120	5066160	Yeah, I could see that.
5066160	5066660	Yeah.
5068480	5069200	I don't know.
5069200	5075840	It they it's it's easily it's because one, I mean, I get it.
5075840	5080480	You can't necessarily copyright certain gameplay elements.
5080480	5085040	I'm I'm laughing because they're a small you have to probably get away with it.
5085040	5087840	Bobby Black Wolf would have won the listless with this answer.
5087840	5090320	Bobby Black Wolf said Pixel Poops.
5090320	5090960	Who pooped?
5095200	5096240	Sure, why not?
5096240	5097600	We can we can rip them off.
5097600	5108000	Well, I saw him back behind the taco place, and so I know he was getting the tacos.
5114720	5116240	I saw Loki vent.
5116240	5117440	I just needed fresh air.
5118240	5119200	Oh, we vented.
5119200	5119600	All right.
5122160	5122560	All right.
5123360	5124320	It was just gas.
5124320	5125680	It wasn't it wasn't.
5126000	5130800	OK, S2100 Matt says you just delayed the game more with that idea.
5130800	5133040	And Bobby says that's the Super Nintendo sequel.
5133600	5136080	So all right, let's move on.
5137520	5140640	Quest Buster, why do you need to roll a toilet paper right now?
5143440	5147120	OK, let's talk about League of Legends.
5147120	5149840	Maybe Riot Games will steal Among Us next.
5149840	5150320	Who knows?
5150960	5154960	Because Riot did just announce that they're putting out a new MMO that's going to be tied
5154960	5156560	into the League of Legends universe.
5156560	5161440	And it was it was done kind of without a ton of fanfare, which kind of surprised me.
5161440	5166880	But there was a Twitter exchange going on where a VP at Riot, Greg Street, talked about how
5166880	5172800	he's been helping to develop the League universe and that this new game he's working on, some
5172800	5174640	might call it massive.
5174640	5176960	And folks have been asking them to create it.
5176960	5182160	And then, yeah, then there's like a follow up tweet that basically just says it very
5182160	5182800	plainly.
5182800	5184240	An MMO is coming.
5184320	5185840	There's no teaser trailer.
5185840	5192320	There's no non-gameplay trailer with concept art or whatever.
5192320	5193360	There's nothing.
5193360	5195760	Just, you know, we announce things on Twitter now.
5195760	5196480	Why not?
5196480	5198720	The government likes to announce policies on Twitter.
5198720	5202240	So why don't we just drop game announcements casually on Twitter like they're nothing?
5202240	5204320	I guess that's the world we live in now.
5204320	5208480	But I know a lot of people will be very happy to hear this, to hear that the League of Legends
5208480	5209920	universe is going to come to an MMO.
5209920	5210880	It makes a lot of sense.
5211840	5216400	And Riot has been trying to expand on that universe a little bit, you know, so like things
5216400	5218320	like Dauntless and some of the other games they've been putting out.
5218320	5222000	So this doesn't surprise me, really, to be honest.
5223520	5225600	Yeah, so all right.
5226720	5230400	Well, usually we would take a trip down memory lane to do the classic.
5230400	5231760	Oh, Dark Soccer is on our way back.
5231760	5234400	So I think we're going to get settled in here.
5234400	5240640	OK, so anyway, so Dark Soccer, if you're back, you're back just in time.
5240640	5243680	Because we're going to get into the classic game of the week.
5244240	5245040	So good timing.
5245040	5245840	Hopefully she's good to go.
5245840	5248000	I forgot to turn off my cam.
5248000	5250880	I noticed you turned it off and then back on somehow.
5250880	5251680	So anyway.
5251680	5255600	Yeah, no, I had an emergency party run.
5255600	5256240	No worries.
5256240	5256560	All right.
5256560	5258320	We're into the classic game of the week tonight.
5258320	5262080	Every week, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault to find a game that she thinks, hey,
5262800	5264640	you kids should be checking this game out.
5264640	5265440	Stop playing.
5265440	5269840	Stop playing Among Us and Fortnite and check out a real classic game.
5270800	5273200	Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game for us.
5273200	5275360	I do want to say, though, Dark Soccer, I don't know if you.
5275360	5277520	It was something I noticed with the clip of this game.
5277520	5278560	And I'll let you introduce in a minute.
5278560	5280080	But I do just want to warn the listeners.
5280080	5281360	There's a lot of flashing in it.
5282160	5285200	So if you are somebody who's susceptible to flashes,
5285200	5288480	you may wish to take a moment to minimize the window so you can just listen.
5289200	5292400	The video will stop when Dark Soccer stops talking about it.
5292400	5294720	But I noticed I was like, oh, there's a lot of flashes in this.
5294720	5295920	I hope it's OK.
5295920	5297280	I didn't get a chance to really watch it.
5297280	5298960	I was actually looking for one that had sound.
5299680	5300560	Oh, gotcha.
5301600	5302100	Yeah.
5303040	5304640	We were right in the middle of doing something,
5304640	5306400	and I had to real quick find a video.
5306400	5308080	No, I mean, that was the game.
5308080	5311120	So I've never heard of this game causing problems.
5311120	5312320	I just want to warn.
5312320	5315920	If you do not like flashes for whatever reason,
5315920	5318160	please avert your eyes now because I'm going to start the footage
5318160	5320320	as soon as Dark Soccer says what the game of the week is.
5321120	5323280	So the game of the week is called Arabian Fight,
5324000	5329680	and it was released only in arcades by Sega in 1992.
5330560	5333920	So it actually was released in January 1992.
5333920	5337440	So the game was in development through 1991 and copyrighted then.
5338400	5342080	So this is kind of your standard beat them up
5342880	5345840	that went along with the other ones of its generation.
5345840	5348880	You know, followed kind of like Golden Axe and Streets of Rage,
5348880	5351920	three action buttons, one punch, one kick, one special attack.
5353280	5355840	Although you have magic based attacks,
5355840	5358960	kind of like how Golden Axe has its special attacks.
5358960	5363040	You can also throw your opponents and you can collect items from chests
5364240	5368400	as well as enemies to do different points,
5368400	5372080	restore health, give you more of your special attack.
5373680	5378240	The game actually does something a little bit unique for its era.
5379200	5384800	Basically, with this game is it has these different scaling techniques
5384800	5389760	to allow the characters to move back and forth in the field.
5389760	5393280	So sort of think of Fatal Fury, you know,
5393280	5395040	where you've got your different fields, you can jump back and forth.
5397040	5403680	And so it will use the foreground elements for special attacks.
5404240	5408640	You can have characters perform their attacks very close to the screen
5408640	5411920	so that only their head and torso fit, kind of like it's animated
5411920	5415040	and different enemies can jump in from the foreground to fight.
5415040	5418320	Although they can't be hit during these animated sequences.
5418320	5422800	And it actually looks like, you know, like an interesting combination
5422800	5426320	of a straight up animation and sprite based fighting.
5427600	5431920	So basically with this game, I mean, it's really fairly simple.
5431920	5434800	You play as one of four characters
5436560	5439680	and you're trying to save the Princess Lurana
5439680	5443360	from being attacked by a corrupt sheik.
5443360	5448000	And so you have to travel to the castle to save the princess.
5450800	5457600	But anyway, your main character is called Sinbat, not Sinbad,
5458560	5460720	Ramaya, Goldor or Datta.
5461680	5463600	Sinbat is the handsome hero.
5464640	5469920	Ramaya is the token, beautiful, scantily dressed female of the game.
5471280	5474560	Goldor is the muscle and the brute.
5475200	5479680	And then Datta is a kind of spiritual looking bald dude.
5480320	5488240	So it was listed for 1992 by Game Machine in Japan
5488240	5494000	as being the most, as the seventh most successful table arcade unit of that year.
5494640	5496400	Now I'm ringing this up because
5498240	5501840	at SSA100MAT it's not Sinbad, it's Sinbat-T.
5504400	5506320	And no, not Goldor from Power Rangers.
5506320	5515920	So at any rate, the game is actually included on the Astra City Mini,
5516560	5521040	the little arcade cabinet being released with all these Sega games.
5522000	5528720	And so there's a chance that people will be able to play it at home now,
5528720	5533280	you know, instead of, you know, emulation or anything like that.
5533360	5539280	Or, you know, MAME again emulation or actually owning a machine.
5539280	5542400	Because I don't think it's been released on any home compilation.
5543360	5545040	So there it is.
5545680	5546720	Really quick one.
5546720	5547520	But you know what?
5548160	5550720	It's a neat game.
5550720	5551520	It's a neat game.
5551520	5555360	Yeah, I got to admit, this is not one I was super familiar with before.
5555360	5557200	Let me take the game down here real quick.
5557200	5558720	And so that, okay, oops.
5558720	5561440	I got to the shot that doesn't have my co-host on it.
5561520	5565200	So the game is now off the screen if you had looked away a moment ago.
5565200	5569360	Again, I'm not aware of anything that that game caused or any problems,
5569360	5572480	but I couldn't help when I was looking at the footage.
5572480	5575440	I was like, oh, this seems like a lot of flashing.
5575440	5579920	So I just I've admittedly been really over cautious, perhaps with recent events.
5580800	5584160	Yeah, perhaps with recent events in the industry in the front of my mind.
5584160	5585520	I was just cyberpunk.
5585520	5586020	Yeah.
5586640	5587840	I was just, you know what?
5587840	5589760	I'm better safe than sorry when it comes to that stuff.
5590640	5591600	But there's your classic game.
5592240	5595040	But I have to say, it was not one I was super familiar with,
5595600	5599680	but it definitely kind of did some interesting thing with the graphics there.
5599680	5602560	It was like kind of like this kind of pseudo 3D effect
5602560	5607200	that's very patently late 90s in it, which I thought was interesting.
5608160	5611440	I really haven't seen too many other games that do that kind of thing,
5611440	5615760	using the large sprites and animation as a foreground element.
5616720	5618160	Not to that extreme.
5618160	5621040	Like that game takes it to a real extreme.
5622400	5626320	And I think it's really, really kind of refreshing for its time.
5626320	5627120	Does that make sense?
5627120	5629280	I think it would be that's going to be really fun.
5629920	5630420	Yeah.
5630960	5631440	All right.
5631440	5635920	So I honestly would hope that Sega would consider doing some sort of
5637360	5639040	like Switch release or something for that.
5639840	5640340	Nice.
5641120	5645120	I'm going to insert a story here, kind of a breaking story, if you will,
5645120	5648080	before we get into rapid fire news, because this is about classic games.
5648960	5651840	Here is something Bobby brought to my attention based on,
5651840	5656000	get this, we got a YouTube comment because over at VoG Network,
5656000	5657440	we actually have a YouTube channel.
5657440	5659680	I'm going to admit we don't have a lot of OLR content on there,
5659680	5660400	at least not right now.
5661040	5664320	Going through the three hour episodes is a lot to go through to put stuff on YouTube.
5664320	5667120	But Bobby has put some highlights from his show because he's only an hour.
5667120	5669680	So he's put some highlights and some clips from his show up there.
5669680	5673760	And one of them was that recently he built an outrun cabinet
5673760	5676640	and he was showing kind of that and what that looked like.
5676640	5679440	So it was the arcade one up outrun cabinet specifically.
5679440	5681280	And he was showing that and that's over on YouTube.
5681280	5685360	So cheap plug for Bobby's YouTube over VoG Network on YouTube.
5686240	5690720	But we got a comment that said, oh, there's five games now.
5691440	5691760	What?
5691760	5696640	Because in the outrun cabinet that Bobby showed, there's only four games.
5696640	5699280	And so there was a comment that said there's five games now.
5699280	5702240	We'll get this over at arcadeoneup.com.
5702240	5707360	They just announced they put out a firmware update for their outrun cabinet
5707360	5709840	that has added a fifth game.
5710400	5713760	Rad Rally is the new game that's been added to the outrun cabinet.
5714560	5717280	This is the first time that something like this has been done.
5717280	5724080	And this explains why potentially there was a USB port on the back of this cabinet
5724080	5726960	that not all the arcade one up cabinets have had.
5726960	5729440	Or maybe this is something we're going to see moving forward
5729440	5732160	is that the USB stuff becomes kind of standard there.
5732640	5734960	So kind of the breaking news there.
5736160	5741440	Arcade one up flexing and now adding an additional game to an existing cabinet
5741440	5744640	with Rad Rally having come to the outrun cabinet.
5744640	5747120	And you got to love the chat.
5747120	5750080	The chat is going, oh, it wasn't Spy Hunter.
5750960	5754160	No, I imagine Spy Hunter will get its own cabinet
5754160	5755600	when they're ready to put that game out.
5756240	5758160	I'm not familiar with Rad Rally.
5759040	5762800	Jamie, is that a title familiar to you
5762800	5764880	and how that would fit into the outrun universe?
5765520	5769200	We actually, it came up in conversation last night just from,
5769760	5771200	gosh, what was it we were looking at?
5771200	5773200	I think we were trying to watch something for Daytona 2.
5774000	5778160	And there, well, because I like, I hate playing Daytona.
5778160	5781200	I hate the attract mode, but I like all the rest of the music in it
5781200	5782720	because that dude is so enthusiastic.
5782960	5789360	But I think it was like a, a poster or something that we were looking at,
5789360	5791840	just like a still picture for something.
5791840	5795200	It might have been some cabinet art for Daytona 2
5795760	5798320	that it didn't look like any of the cars in there.
5798320	5801760	It was something sort of offhand and Dan brought up that game.
5801760	5804160	Oh, it could be from that, you know, is what it looked like because,
5805120	5808720	but I don't really remember the whole situation.
5808720	5809280	I get it.
5809280	5810960	So I'm looking at more information on it.
5810960	5816560	It's actually Rad Mobile was a way that this game was often referred to.
5816560	5820720	And also when it was ported to the Sega Saturn, it was called Gale Racer,
5820720	5823120	but essentially it's all a very similar game.
5823120	5826720	And they say that usually it is credit for Yu Suzuki.
5826720	5829840	It does kind of fall into kind of the outrun family in that way.
5829840	5833200	And now that I'm looking at it, I'm like, oh, okay, I have seen this before.
5833200	5837680	So it's just kind of a racing game that had several different names with minor tweaks,
5837680	5838880	but that's still very interesting.
5839680	5840180	Kind of neat.
5841440	5842160	So, all right.
5842800	5847200	But yeah, I just, it's funny that that came up so randomly in our conversation last night.
5847200	5847700	Yeah.
5848320	5851760	Um, so, and then you mentioned, I was like, oh yeah, Dan, kind of,
5851760	5853680	we had that kind of mentioned in, in passing.
5854400	5858240	And Orange Right says Rad Rally was the sequel to Rad Mobile.
5858240	5860080	So interesting, interesting.
5860080	5863520	And Bobby says it's a micro USB port on the back of the cabinet.
5863520	5866400	So if he wants to add the game, he has to get a little converter to do it.
5866400	5867600	That's still pretty cool though.
5868640	5869760	Very interested in that.
5869760	5873120	Also, hey Bobby, and I'm going to totally use leverage the show.
5873120	5875200	I meant to ask you this on the call earlier.
5875200	5877440	Can you send me the link to where you bought your
5878560	5882000	Mega 64, the large Commodore 64?
5882000	5882880	Cause I want one.
5882880	5885920	And when I went onto Amazon to get one, all I could find were the minis.
5886480	5891200	And I think I found like one big one, but I think it might've been out of stock or it
5891200	5893360	was from a seller name I didn't recognize.
5893360	5895120	So I was like, is this a resale?
5895120	5895920	I don't know what it is.
5895920	5898960	So, um, uh, maybe they don't have it anymore.
5898960	5903200	I don't know, but I, uh, I'm just going to ask very nicely for that link.
5903200	5903520	All right.
5904080	5906320	Cause I want one as a Christmas present to myself.
5907120	5913200	Let's what was the, um, what was the, the version of rad mobile that came out on Saturn?
5913200	5915520	I'm just trying to double check something real quick.
5915520	5916480	Gale racer.
5916480	5917520	I think I closed the window.
5918560	5919060	Yeah.
5919360	5919520	Yeah.
5919520	5920400	That's what I'm looking for.
5920960	5923680	There are, there are, they're all technically different games, but they're just kind of
5923680	5926720	all like spiritual, like, you know, related.
5926720	5929520	So, yeah, that was the one I was trying to think of.
5929520	5929840	Got it.
5930400	5930720	All right.
5930720	5934800	Uh, let's get to some rapid fire news and some other news around the industry pretty
5934800	5935360	quickly here.
5935360	5935860	Loki.
5937120	5937840	Yeah.
5937840	5943520	So we've got, um, some more news about control, which is coming, getting a PlayStation five
5943520	5950160	and Xbox series X and S version with ray tracing that's coming in February on the second.
5950720	5955920	Um, and then it's going to also have a full retail release on March 2nd.
5956720	5962880	Um, they're going to have a performance mode, which runs at 60 FPS on both platforms.
5962880	5969120	Well, I guess the standard version is going to run 30 FPS, but will allow for ray tracing.
5970000	5973680	So kind of the standard fare that we've been getting with some of these newer games.
5973680	5980880	Just remember though, you have to, um, purchase the ultimate edition in order to be able to
5980880	5986080	get the Xbox series S and X upgrade and PlayStation five upgrade.
5987600	5993360	So that's annoying because we're unfortunately unable to offer an upgrade path to all existing
5993360	5994720	control players.
5994720	5997920	That is a bunch of crap because they accidentally released it.
5999920	6001440	So that is wrong.
6001920	6004560	Um, but that is what they're sticking by.
6004560	6009840	So if you feel it's worth it, honestly, I will just wait for it to hit game pass.
6010720	6017120	Um, and then cyberpunk 2077 is getting a crossover with death stranding.
6017120	6018640	Um, Mars is a death strand.
6018640	6024160	He's got a crossover with cyberpunk, which makes sense since a Kojima did have a cameo
6024160	6026400	in cyberpunk 2077.
6026400	6026800	Oh, really?
6026800	6028560	But apparently, yes, he did.
6028560	6030080	Uh, he is in the game.
6030080	6036960	Um, so you'll be able to get a few different things there, including a silver hand cybernetic
6036960	6037280	arm.
6038000	6045440	Um, also there's some, uh, cyberpunk themed holograms and a selection of customization
6045440	6046800	and clothing options.
6047520	6053360	And in addition, you can also equip Sam with a new hacking ability, which allows him to,
6054080	6057440	um, mess with sensor poles and mule tracks and stuff.
6058080	6061360	So that's, uh, coming to PC right now.
6061360	6067200	They haven't announced any sort of, um, update to the PlayStation four version, but at least
6067200	6068400	PC is going to be getting that.
6071200	6075680	And as Joe and Matt saying, you can still unlock the car from cyberpunk in horizon four,
6075680	6076180	I believe.
6076960	6077360	Yes.
6077360	6078080	Oh, that's right.
6078080	6078480	Yeah.
6078480	6078980	Yeah.
6079520	6083600	And I've been seeing that death stranding, um, cyberpunk, uh, thing being promoted in
6083600	6088160	the Epic game store, because, uh, you know what, despite the fact that we talk, um, a
6088160	6093520	significant amount of shit about Epic on this show, sometimes look, I love ZZT.
6093520	6094640	There's something nice.
6094640	6098720	And I also love free games and they've been giving away a lot of them.
6098720	6101600	So just a reminder, if you haven't been going in there and getting your free game every
6101600	6103120	day, uh, get on that.
6103120	6105680	They'll probably be something real good in the coming days.
6105680	6109840	Um, usually I think it was last year when they gave away like civ six on the last day
6109840	6110240	or something.
6110240	6112560	I remember there was something big they gave away at one point.
6112560	6114400	Um, so keep an eye on that y'all.
6115040	6115680	All right.
6115680	6119440	Meanwhile, though, the other rapid fire news I had for you guys, Jason referenced this
6119440	6120320	in the intro tonight.
6120320	6121200	Thank you, Jason.
6121200	6127280	Uh, but guitar freaks and drum mania, if you will, has officially been released for PC.
6127280	6131120	Now we talked a little bit about the beta test prior, uh, but the official release has
6131120	6133520	now come out at least in Japan.
6133520	6138160	Um, not a big fan of these games, not coming out in the U S I know Jason addressed the
6138160	6140480	music licensing thing at the top of the show.
6140480	6143920	Still a little bit disappointing, uh, at least that the originals can't make their
6143920	6145840	way into some type of U S version.
6145840	6149680	Uh, but it's probably harder to release games in the U S when you've closed all your U S
6149680	6150560	offices.
6150560	6155200	Um, still, if you are the type that is fine reading, uh, enough Japanese to get through
6155200	6160880	this and you use the Konami online or the Kona suite, uh, uh, online, uh, there's probably
6160880	6165200	going to be a lot here for you, including over 200 songs that is from the arcade version
6165200	6166160	of Ghidadora.
6166160	6170160	Uh, it's a very true to arcade experience, which I would expect it to be cause it's arcade
6170160	6172960	machines basically run on modified PCs of sorts.
6172960	6180960	Uh, and uh, yeah, it's, uh, this, the online service for this game will run you 1,628 yen
6180960	6181440	a month.
6181440	6183360	That's about 15 bucks.
6183360	6185760	So kind of what you'd pay for an MMO, I suppose.
6185760	6186880	Yeah, it's not bad.
6186880	6192560	Um, so check that out music game fans, if that is up your alley and you don't mind having
6192560	6195440	to do it all in Japanese and they also have a controller.
6196400	6196960	Oh, that's right.
6196960	6197200	Yeah.
6197200	6199200	They got a PC controllers coming out.
6199200	6204640	That's not going to turn into something, uh, where somebody puts out a freemium type of
6204640	6206000	thing that uses those controllers.
6206000	6209600	I'm sure like a step mania type of thing.
6210240	6210560	Right.
6210560	6210880	Yeah.
6210880	6215760	And well, I'm sure that it looks already very much like a rock band controller or guitar
6215760	6216960	hero controller.
6216960	6218880	Um, and it's expensive.
6218880	6220480	350 bucks basically.
6220480	6221840	You know what they need to do?
6221840	6223200	Oh, Jesus Christ.
6223200	6224480	You know what they need to do though?
6224480	6228400	If it looks like one of those controllers, how about putting out a controller that works
6228400	6229360	with rock band?
6229360	6231120	Because it's kind of funny.
6232000	6236640	Now everybody used to have those plastic instruments shitting up their house everywhere.
6237280	6241360	So many of those have been thrown away or gone to the used market or what have you.
6241360	6246320	Now that like rock band four is backwards compatible, at least on Xbox for sure.
6246320	6248160	I'm pretty sure it is on PS5 as well.
6248160	6252240	I don't see why it wouldn't be, uh, people kind of want those plastic instruments again.
6252240	6255760	They want to be able to play those games again with the instruments and you can't really
6255760	6260000	do it, uh, without buying, you know, really now, now people are charging an arm and a
6260000	6260960	leg for those things.
6260960	6262800	So, uh, probably sell mine.
6262800	6266240	I mean, well, yeah, if you're not using them, somebody will buy them.
6266240	6268880	So anyway, just an interesting aside.
6268880	6271120	I thought I'd kind of bring up cause it's related.
6271120	6277200	Uh, also worth noting, uh, Hey, uh, we talked previously about during the game awards, Sephiroth
6277200	6280960	was going to be released as a new character in smash brothers.
6280960	6282400	When is that going to happen?
6282400	6286240	Well, for many people, it has already happened because if you can beat him into challenge
6286240	6289760	mode, even if you do it on Bobby Black Wolf mode, that is very easy mode.
6289760	6291200	You will earn Sephiroth.
6291200	6293520	So most people that really want them have them.
6293520	6296480	For everybody else, I think it's the 23rd, the 22nd.
6296480	6298640	Eh, most of you are probably already in there playing with them.
6299360	6303600	Also, some Mii fighters came out with that, which is pretty cool, but this is, this is
6303600	6304480	the really funny thing.
6304480	6304720	Okay.
6304720	6305600	You ready?
6305600	6308480	The Mii fighters that came out to go along with Sephiroth.
6309120	6310640	Barrett makes sense, right?
6310640	6311840	Final Fantasy character.
6311840	6313760	Tifa, Final Fantasy character.
6313760	6315600	Aerith, Final Fantasy character.
6315600	6317440	Chocobo with a little hat, right?
6317440	6318720	Cute, Final Fantasy character.
6318720	6321040	And then the last one that came out, Geno.
6321760	6322800	That's right.
6322800	6324800	Geno is now in smash brothers.
6325520	6325760	Yes.
6325760	6331440	The beloved super Mario RPG character of all time finally made his way to smash brothers
6331440	6332640	as a Mii costume.
6332640	6337680	That's unfortunate.
6337680	6342480	And the internet fanboys shed a tear for their obscure character that will never come.
6342480	6343520	Waluigi says hi.
6344800	6345920	No, Waluigi says,
6348960	6350400	Now it can be my turn.
6352480	6353200	All right.
6353200	6357520	Anyhow, moving on, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
6358480	6361760	Um, well, some pinball news, which has kind of been,
6363360	6365280	people have been polarized actually over this.
6365280	6371360	I've been chatting with some people, but the new stern game that was announced is Led Zeppelin,
6371360	6372480	which I don't know.
6372480	6375760	I'm kind of tired of them doing all these like band games.
6376320	6379680	I mean, but getting the license for Led Zeppelin, that's pretty cool.
6379680	6381680	And on top of that, it's a Steve Ritchie table.
6381680	6386640	And Steve is known for his fast action type of games.
6386640	6391440	I mean, he did Black Knight, Black Knight 2000, Black Knight Sword of Rage,
6392480	6395840	the newer Star Wars that came out.
6395840	6398480	So he's known for his fast tables.
6400560	6402720	And I think it looks pretty good.
6402720	6407040	I mean, you've got your usual multiple versions of it.
6407920	6412640	So there is the, you know, the regular production one.
6412640	6416960	There is the pro and then there's the premium limited edition.
6416960	6419520	And then you can also get accessories to go for the table.
6420160	6422880	So, um, I don't know.
6423680	6427200	I know people who are planning on getting it and I'll play theirs when it comes out.
6427200	6430240	I'm not in a hurry for it myself, but hey, it's Led Zeppelin.
6430960	6434400	So also SNK is getting a little bit, uh,
6435120	6442400	Teasy, they have, uh, teased a console coming out in 2021.
6443280	6451280	That quote is a system to bridge the needs between passionate fans and console gaming enthusiasts.
6452480	6460240	So I'm wondering if we might be getting some sort of, uh, AES MVS, like
6460320	6464800	machine, I guess I have like maybe multiple carts or something, or have the cartridges be on
6465520	6469920	smaller cartridges and release that simply just for the SNK items.
6469920	6474000	They had the mini 50 in one, and then they released their own version.
6474000	6475920	It's not officially arcade one up.
6475920	6480560	It's a clone, basically another company that has like 50 games in it.
6480560	6482640	So I, but it's ramulated.
6483280	6483520	Okay.
6483520	6483840	Yeah.
6483840	6486000	And this could be something maybe uses cartridges.
6486000	6486400	I don't know.
6486400	6490160	It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,
6490160	6495680	it's interesting, but I don't know.
6495680	6497520	I mean, it can be interesting.
6497520	6501440	It depends on, uh, on, you know, when they put out more information about it.
6501440	6507600	Uh, but yeah, I think that, that, uh, I mean, I still would just rather have had like an
6507600	6510320	all-in-one MVS AES and be done with it.
6510320	6511200	So we'll see.
6511200	6511680	Yeah.
6511680	6514400	I'd like to see that kind of come back, but we'll see.
6514400	6514640	Yeah.
6515280	6515600	All right.
6515600	6517280	Cartridges the size of your head.
6518080	6520400	That's a cartridge that could kill somebody.
6520400	6523040	Honestly, I'm not that heavy, but yeah.
6524080	6524640	All right.
6524640	6525440	Then you're not using it.
6525440	6525840	Right.
6525840	6526160	All right.
6527920	6529040	Uh, and Dr.
6529040	6532480	Sues is maybe same idea as their arcade thing, but a console instead.
6533200	6536000	Either way, it's sure to be better than the VCS.
6536000	6536800	Just saying.
6536800	6537200	All right.
6539120	6543120	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates, which I imagine it's finally
6543120	6548400	going to start to get quiet this week, seeing as, Oh, it's Christmas this week.
6548400	6552240	But this has been a weird year all around the board.
6552240	6553440	So what's coming out this week?
6553440	6556000	Loki, not a ton of things.
6556000	6557040	So you're right.
6557040	6562880	Um, so double dragon neon on the Nintendo switch, uh, override to super mech league
6562880	6569280	on PC, Nintendo switch PlayStation four PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series X, uh, super meat
6569280	6572080	boy forever on PC and Nintendo switch.
6572800	6577280	Who's your daddy on PC, Mac and Xbox one.
6578080	6583440	And then last but not least we have, um, actually, no, I take that back.
6583440	6589600	So we're going to have, looks like, uh, the Hong Kong massacre on Nintendo switch.
6589600	6593760	And then the last but not least is earth defense force world brothers.
6593760	6599200	That's that voxel cutesy earth defense force games coming to Nintendo switch and PlayStation
6599200	6599840	four.
6599840	6600560	Neat.
6600560	6601200	That's it.
6601200	6601680	All right.
6601760	6602960	That's it for the year.
6602960	6603760	That's it for the year.
6603760	6604080	All right.
6604080	6606480	Traveling to Japan and checking out the releases there.
6606480	6609280	Uh, it's, it's a little different Christmas, a little different there.
6609280	6613360	So here's some games that you can play while you enjoy your cake, uh, on the Nintendo switch
6613360	6616960	this week, earth defense force world brothers, like Loki just mentioned is out in Japan as
6616960	6617120	well.
6617120	6624960	And the 24th fight of gods also out, uh, sniper elite for vampire with a Y, uh, is out, uh,
6624960	6630240	also the Alistair collection, uh, and metal max Zeno.
6630240	6636000	Um, and the, uh, that's a peripheral, uh, that's it, but there's, Oh, next week, I'm
6636000	6639600	going to spoil next week's just cause I want to get dark soccer's reaction to the fact
6639600	6641280	that I'm on new year's Eve.
6641280	6644000	Digimon survive is coming out on the switch in Japan.
6644000	6644640	That's kind of fun.
6645600	6651680	Dark soccer was really the only person I knew who, who stand Digimon, um, and maybe
6652640	6660880	Digimon zero two, um, that the whole first era Digimon Digimon zero two and, uh, uh,
6660880	6662000	Digimon try.
6662000	6662400	Gotcha.
6663120	6665920	Um, the PlayStation four, pretty similar story.
6665920	6669920	You're at defense for swirl brothers, vampire, the Alistair collection.
6669920	6672960	Um, uh, all that same stuff also on the PlayStation four.
6672960	6674800	So those are your releases for this week.
6674800	6675600	How about the UK?
6675600	6679600	Dark soccer is only one, only one.
6680640	6683520	And it is overdrive to ultimate deluxe edition.
6683520	6691520	That's it on the 22nd, which is in a day in the UK very soon.
6692720	6693360	All right.
6693360	6694800	We have some more stories for you guys.
6694800	6698720	Then we'll get to the listener round table, but first, uh, Loki.
6700000	6700400	Yeah.
6700480	6706880	So, uh, as we've, I don't know, it's, it's just the game industry, I guess, but, you
6706880	6711520	know, we talked about shady reviews and stuff and not, um, revealing all the information
6711520	6714880	when, uh, we were talking about cyberpunk and that type of thing.
6714880	6721280	Well, now game companies are wisening up to the fact that game reviews come out.
6721280	6724400	People purchase the game space on those initial reviews.
6724400	6729200	And sometimes they don't like hearing about how there's microtransactions in the game.
6729200	6730160	So what did they do?
6730160	6735360	If you're Ubisoft, you wait a month before you start selling those really egregious microtransactions.
6735360	6736560	And that's what they do with it.
6736560	6745120	Or you wait until right before the Chris McQuanzica holiday season, when this gift is going to
6745120	6746640	start showing up for people.
6746640	6748400	And that's when you pull the trigger.
6749600	6750960	And this isn't new for them.
6750960	6753680	They've done sort of XP booster type things before.
6754320	6758960	But now Assassin's Creed Valhalla, they've, I guess, updated the game to include them.
6759520	6766400	And it's going to leave you, um, $10 lighter if you decide to purchase it and it'll allow
6766400	6770240	you to earn 50% more experience.
6772320	6777200	And it's, uh, you know, I don't know, clearly.
6777200	6778080	I mean, I get it.
6778080	6782080	Sometimes people are in a hurry to play a game and stuff like that, and they don't want
6782080	6787120	to, um, you know, work through whatever.
6787120	6790000	But, you know, back in the day that used to be like cheats and stuff.
6790000	6796640	And let's be honest, if, if this is the type of thing that you like doing, I might suggest
6796640	6800160	getting a PC because you can just cheat without paying $10.
6801040	6806960	You can just increase, you know, your levels or whatever, without having to shell out money
6806960	6808640	for something that would normally be free.
6808640	6810560	Just use modifications.
6810560	6811520	Exactly.
6811520	6817600	You can get double XP and titties in your game through the magic of mods.
6818560	6820720	This is not the first time, like I said, that they've done this.
6820720	6822320	They did this in Odyssey as well.
6822880	6828800	And they had denied before that boosters, um, didn't influence the design of the game.
6828800	6834880	They, they, they basically say they didn't throttle the game, um, based on this stuff.
6834880	6838400	However, you may remember there was also, you know, the Lord of the Rings game that
6838400	6846240	came out that they did like, and a lot of these games do increase the grind to allow
6846240	6850000	you to, um, be more motivated to purchase these.
6850000	6856960	So they may say it that didn't influence it, but it influenced it.
6856960	6859840	Quest busters, uh, quest buster, excuse me, in chat is pointing out.
6859840	6863200	Um, Oh, come on the experience boost for 10 bucks for Valhalla.
6863200	6864800	It's not really necessary.
6864800	6868240	So kind of pointing out that, you know, for this game, it's probably not needed.
6868880	6870560	Odyssey's leveling was glacial though.
6870560	6872640	There was definitely a difference there versus origin.
6873840	6878800	So kind of interesting how you may not need it, but they'll still sell it to you.
6879600	6880480	Exactly.
6880480	6885200	Speaking of things that they're going to sell to you as a subscription to their Ubisoft,
6885200	6886720	uh, game service.
6886720	6891680	So Ubisoft plus of course, you know, that $15 service that, uh, basically like the EA
6891680	6892720	play stuff.
6892720	6896560	Well, now they're going to be offering it to stadia users as well.
6896560	6897360	So that's right.
6897360	6900800	Not only do you get the pay for stadium, but you can also pay for this as well.
6900800	6905280	If you want to play all these different Ubisoft games, I guess that's slightly better than,
6905280	6914320	um, pain for each individual game with stadia as that's not very, um, good, uh, value as
6914320	6914800	it is.
6914800	6920240	But I mean, this is slightly better, I guess, but it is something that they are offering
6920240	6921840	because, you know, they want all the money.
6921840	6922560	So why not?
6924240	6924720	Why not?
6925520	6926160	All right.
6926160	6926560	Yeah.
6926560	6930480	Well, let's move on and talk about that streaming service that y'all are going to play this
6930480	6934880	game on and complain about this DLC on just like we're doing right now here on lovely
6934880	6938800	Twitch and a Twitch has announced a variety of policy updates this week.
6938800	6941840	In fact, you've probably been seeing some of them scroll across the bottom for those
6941840	6945040	of you that are, uh, watching live on Twitch this week.
6945040	6948720	Um, and, uh, yeah, it has to do with some big policy updates.
6948720	6950960	They did a town hall earlier this week.
6950960	6954720	Finally, they had promised that and they did the town hall and they talked about some,
6954960	6959600	recent policy changes and they address some things about the DMCA sexual harassment ads
6959600	6961120	and some of those other issues.
6961120	6967120	Um, but what was interesting is kind of what everybody kind of was talking about after
6967120	6974880	the fact was Twitch has decided to ban words like simp in cell and Virgin, but when used
6974880	6977360	in derogatory contexts.
6977360	6980480	So, I mean, like if I was talking about deserve to be
6980480	6989840	Well, if I'm talking about the Virgin Mary at Christmas or something, then that's, I,
6989840	6990400	that's fine.
6990400	6996000	Cause I'm not using it in a derogatory manner, but if I'm calling somebody a Virgin who can't
6996000	6999360	drive, then that is using it in a derogatory manner.
6999360	7004160	But how is Twitch going to understand context of stuff?
7004160	7008000	Because that's a great question that I think they should answer.
7008880	7015440	Cause I, if I'm going to guess, I'm going to say they can't because most of these platforms,
7015440	7019760	when it comes to banning people for different things, you know, they'll cite that you're
7019760	7026240	violating their rule, but it may be, you know, in the context of it, it may not be egregious.
7026240	7032400	Um, so I don't all of a sudden believe that they're going to start applying context to
7032400	7032720	this.
7032720	7035920	I think they're just going to straight up, just ban it altogether.
7036000	7040240	In fact, I'm going to stop you because we don't want misinformation out there.
7040240	7041520	They did clarify.
7041520	7044160	These words are not blanket banned.
7044160	7049200	They will only incur penalties when they quote negatively refer to another person's sexual
7049200	7050240	practices.
7050240	7053760	It does sound like it is.
7053760	7058320	And Twitch is kind of adding it to their utility belt of reasons.
7058320	7064000	We could ban you if you're being a douche nozzle in someone's chat, then we can say,
7064000	7066880	well, you're not supposed to use words like that in a negative context.
7066880	7070080	You called somebody a virgin who can't drive in their chat.
7070080	7072000	And so you're, you're banned for that.
7072000	7076160	Cause you were in general, you were being an asshole, but this specifically is why you
7076160	7077200	got the ban.
7077200	7082320	I, I, I kind of feel like that's what they're doing, but I'm not disagreeing with either
7082320	7085360	of you either because there's so much of it that's subjective.
7085360	7089600	And how do we know that this is going to be applied appropriately across the board?
7089600	7089920	Right.
7090160	7094560	So, um, it should be noted they've already been, uh, removing emotes.
7094560	7100160	So, um, that's why you don't have a VoG network simp emote is that we're not allowed to have
7100160	7100480	them.
7100480	7102320	And it wasn't something we wanted anyway.
7102320	7103360	Um, but.
7103360	7108720	We, there, there have been channels that had emotes and, uh, they're no longer there and
7108720	7109920	they don't approve new ones.
7109920	7115440	Um, now some people are still calling out some of the other problems that are still
7116240	7120880	hap- happening on Twitch, such as you can still walk into people's chat and say slurs
7120880	7122320	with little to no action.
7122320	7126960	And, uh, where was the, where is the outrage that people are having over these words?
7126960	7128080	Simp, Incel, and Virgil.
7128080	7132640	Where was that outrage when black and female streamers were complaining about being harassed
7132640	7133520	on Twitch?
7133520	7139440	That comment from a streamer DaPurpleSharpie, where was Twitch's we need to stop harassment
7139440	7140400	stance then?
7141200	7143120	So fair question.
7143120	7151120	Um, I guess one could say at least they're trying, but this almost goes back to what
7151120	7155360	we said at the top of the show with the Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft thing.
7155360	7157920	It's one thing to put out a statement.
7157920	7160480	It's another to take the actions to back it up.
7161040	7164960	And I think that's where we're at here with the Twitch thing.
7164960	7169440	It, okay, how nice that you have a policy now and you are putting on this front of taking
7169440	7170720	things seriously.
7170720	7177200	But until you put the actions behind it to make folks like DaPurpleSharpie feel more
7177200	7184560	welcome on Twitch, as opposed to the unnecessary bullshit that streamers have to put up with
7184560	7190160	sometimes, um, then if we just think it's all lip service and I get that.
7190960	7197360	So I think we need to see Twitch, you know, really do something, uh, besides just, oh,
7197360	7201200	we're going to ban for these certain words, like actually do them.
7201200	7205920	So, well, here's the funny thing too, is like, like after this announcement came out, there
7205920	7212880	was actually, um, one of the, uh, team members of, I guess the Atlanta phase who go, his
7212880	7213760	name is Simp.
7214400	7219760	And so he's like, uh, I have like some issues with this idea.
7219760	7225680	Well, but, but also this is also, I honestly, Loki, like I get that, but I think this is
7225680	7230400	a problem where people are fixated on the headline and the headline going around is
7230400	7232880	Twitch has banned Simp in cell version.
7234000	7240160	People aren't reading the fucking article and noticing that it's banned when used in
7240160	7244800	certain contexts and there's no blanket robot ban on those words.
7244800	7252640	So that guy who called himself Simp is not by context breaking the rule just by existing.
7253440	7261040	It's if somebody decides to take it to a place where they're making fun, you know, then I
7261040	7265440	feel like people are reacting to a headline only without really looking at the details
7265440	7265920	of it.
7265920	7267040	And that works both ways.
7268000	7269360	So, sure.
7269360	7269680	All right.
7270480	7275520	Sia Tabiri in chat says, share, you're a Simp in cell virgin who can't drive.
7275520	7281040	That'll be the remake, Sia Tabiri, the unavoidable remake of Clueless.
7281040	7286640	I hope, I hope some of you caught my reference there to the holy text of the great Alicia
7286640	7287520	Silverstone classic.
7287520	7287920	Thank you.
7287920	7288720	Thank you, Dark Sakura.
7288720	7289920	I knew if anyone would.
7289920	7290480	All right.
7290480	7292960	Rest in peace, Brittany Murphy, Forever in Our Hearts.
7292960	7294560	All right, moving on.
7295280	7296240	Let's get to some other stuff.
7296240	7296880	Dark Sakura.
7298000	7305440	Well, we had talked a little bit about, you know, safety and trying to ban whatever.
7306800	7309840	So we have news from Afghanistan.
7309840	7313840	They've banned PUBG and called for regulation of video games.
7313840	7321280	As the Afghanistan Telecom Regulatory Authority, the ATRA announced that they decided to ban
7321280	7326080	PUBG temporarily after a comprehensive assessment.
7326080	7331840	They held meetings with various ministries like their religious affairs, education, public
7331840	7337840	health, communications and science, psychologists, parents, headmasters of schools, telecom,
7337840	7343360	civil activists and PUBG gamers before submitting a report to the authority board.
7344960	7348800	And the quote, the decision was taken to block this game on a temporary basis, considering
7348800	7350880	social and security perspectives.
7352160	7357920	ATRA continues investigations and consultations to find out a permanent solution there, too.
7360160	7365600	They were saying that the games have negative impacts on children,
7366160	7374320	um, that they want to provide support for games that comply with Afghan and social culture,
7374320	7376080	as well as religious values.
7376720	7379840	And so the ban, well, they didn't say so.
7379840	7382240	It also would apply to, I think, all iterations of PUBG.
7383520	7390560	And they've now joined the list of other countries like Nepal, Iraq, Jordan, Pakistan, India,
7391120	7400000	um, to prevent in some places said negative effects or to be harmful for society and would
7400000	7402880	also cause a potential national security threat.
7404720	7414160	In Pakistan, the ban was temporary with the Islamabad High Court lifting that ban later.
7414800	7421040	Um, the country, though, in India, there are things saying that their ministry of electronics
7421040	7427040	and I.T. were alleging that the game was stealing user data in an unauthorized manner for servers
7427040	7428480	outside of India.
7429280	7431280	So there you go.
7431280	7432000	Interesting.
7432000	7436400	A very real reaction from S.H.A. 100 Matt in our chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network,
7436400	7440080	who says the folks who care will fire up those VPNs to play.
7440880	7441120	Yeah.
7441120	7443840	So kind of go outside the ban using that.
7443840	7445520	And that's that's for sure.
7445520	7449840	But not every day you hear about a country banning a video game.
7449840	7451520	So interesting nonetheless.
7452160	7453760	So all right.
7453760	7454800	Well, let's move on.
7454800	7455300	Loki.
7457520	7458020	All right.
7458800	7464720	So we it's been a couple of weeks since the game awards, but we have some of the kind
7464720	7465840	of numbers and everything.
7465840	7469920	So not surprising because everybody's stuck at home.
7469920	7476800	Viewership has increased by 83 percent, and that was over eight point three million viewers
7476800	7479120	that tuned into the game awards this year.
7479120	7483600	So pretty, pretty decent size event, I think.
7484400	7489520	And so that was all coming from Jeff Keighley on Twitter talking about the viewership for
7489520	7490000	that.
7490000	7494800	And of course, you know, I expect it to be even bigger next year.
7494800	7496160	So pretty awesome.
7498400	7502560	Yeah, I think you're right that probably the stay at home probably played into that a lot.
7502560	7504640	There's just more people in general watching TV.
7504640	7507760	But I think there is something to be said about this particular award show is getting
7507760	7508880	a lot more credit.
7509680	7512880	And I think a lot more of the co-streaming is helping, too.
7512880	7515920	Like, I'm not just saying that to toot our own horns here at VOG Network, but I think
7515920	7520560	there's a lot of people out there that are creating an event out of this like a watching
7520560	7525040	event, you know, similar to, you know, an E3 press conference or some other type of
7525040	7530240	big event watching and doing it live is very important, because if you're not watching
7530240	7533040	it live, you're going to get it all spoiled for you on Twitter and the newsletter.
7533040	7536560	So I think it has become kind of event watching in that regard.
7536560	7542640	And I think even, you know, when we look at next year and, you know, hopefully by December
7542640	7548000	some sense of normalcy returning that you're still going to see that this does very well.
7548960	7553280	So I know I'll still be watching and we'll probably still do another live react like
7553280	7554240	we did last time.
7554240	7555200	It was fun.
7555200	7555700	Yeah.
7556480	7556980	All right.
7558000	7562000	For our last story tonight, you knew I had to talk about this at some point because this
7562000	7563200	was one of those.
7563200	7565600	Maybe I would have chosen my words differently, Doug.
7566400	7567680	Let's talk about this.
7567680	7569280	So this was in the interview.
7572160	7574960	Yes, I don't know why I saved this one for last night.
7574960	7580560	I feel like sometimes in the B block, we don't really have, like, great big things
7580560	7581680	to comment on.
7581680	7583760	So I was like, let's save this one for last.
7584800	7592880	So, Doug, let's talk about what you said this week and who I'm referring to is the Nintendo
7592880	7595920	of America president, Doug Bowser.
7595920	7598080	You'll never be Reggie Fils-Aime.
7598080	7598880	You'll never.
7598880	7601280	You're just a, you're a CEO.
7601280	7602800	No one will have the Reggie jawline.
7602800	7604800	You're a CEO who can't drive.
7604800	7607840	All right, look, Doug, I'm just being an asshole.
7607840	7614000	Like, Doug Bowser is fine, but this particular quote in this particular interview and this
7614000	7617200	particular answer to this particular question ain't it.
7618160	7619280	So what am I talking about?
7619280	7621200	So he did an interview with Polygon.
7622240	7624880	There's a whole other thing I could talk about, but I'm not going to tonight.
7625840	7627520	He did.
7627520	7633520	I'm going to just start calling him Porygon, like the really crappy looking Pokemon.
7633520	7640000	So Bowser did an interview with Porygon and he was talking about special releases like
7640000	7641920	Super Mario 3D All-Stars.
7641920	7648400	And basically the question that came up was, you know, what, what, why are you doing this?
7648400	7649680	Why are you end dating?
7649680	7652480	It seems like you guys really like March 31st.
7653120	7656640	You're not going to let people buy Mario 3D All-Stars after that fact and, you know,
7656640	7658800	Super Mario 35, you know.
7658800	7661600	So how does Mr. Bowser respond to this?
7662240	7665920	I think I use a simple word, celebration.
7666560	7672720	It's just, this is a celebration of Mario's 35th anniversary and we wanted to celebrate
7672720	7674880	in unique and different ways.
7674880	7679680	And we've done that through games like Super Mario 3D All-Stars, or we will be doing that
7679680	7684320	through future releases like Super Mario 3D World and Bowser's Fury.
7684320	7686800	That wasn't the question, Doug.
7687520	7693680	That wasn't an opportunity to sell more copies of Super Mario 3D World, Doug.
7693680	7696960	It's not about celebration, Doug.
7696960	7701840	It's about why are you stopping to sell these games on March 31st?
7703120	7708080	So there are various ways that we're celebrating Mario's 35th and with some of these titles,
7708080	7713440	we felt it was an opportunity to release them for a limited period of time.
7713440	7715200	They've done very, very well.
7716000	7719440	In other words, you stupids bought it.
7724240	7727760	Roll credits because that's what it boils down to.
7727760	7731280	The celebration is we made a lot of fucking money.
7731920	7733600	That's the celebration.
7734240	7739680	We found when we artificially create shortages that it drives up sales.
7739680	7743120	And so now we're moving that to digital products is what he meant to say.
7745600	7746800	Shall I continue with a quote?
7746800	7747520	Oh, yes, I will.
7748640	7754240	Super Mario 3D All-Stars has sold over 2.6 million units in the US alone.
7754240	7758880	And so clearly consumers have been able to jump in and enjoy that.
7758880	7762400	And it's not strategy that we're going to be using widely.
7763600	7766320	Notice how he says they might use it again, though.
7766880	7772560	But it's one we thought was very unique for the actual anniversary.
7772560	7775520	Yes, Doug, I would call it unique.
7776240	7777840	That's a good word.
7777840	7781360	Oh, Doug, I'm just going to, like, start using Doug.
7781360	7787680	Like I don't know why I've decided to just call him Doug.
7787680	7789200	But that is that is where I'm at.
7789200	7791440	That is the reaction I had to this whole thing.
7791440	7796640	OK, I propose from here out that any time someone in the video game industry
7796640	7797680	says something stupid.
7798880	7800640	They're Doug, like a Karen.
7801200	7803200	Sure, Doug.
7803200	7803760	You know what?
7804560	7807200	An amazing 90s Nickelodeon cartoon you are not.
7808560	7810160	No, you are not quail man.
7810160	7811440	Look, here's the thing.
7811440	7815680	And again, I know I sound like I'm just dumping on him based on this one bad quote.
7815680	7820720	But this is this is the shit that really annoys us about Nintendo is.
7822000	7823440	It's a celebration.
7823440	7827040	No, it's not as you did this to sell more copies of the game.
7827040	7830240	And in this interview, you are basically saying it worked.
7830240	7831600	You bought it, suckers.
7832160	7837200	But he can't really say that because Doug is the president of Nintendo.
7837200	7845520	And so Doug cannot just say, well, we did this so we would sell as much as possible
7845520	7850080	this fiscal year with our kind of weaker than usual holiday lineup,
7850800	7855520	because that's that's not an answer Doug can give Doug.
7855520	7864640	Let's see what our our commenters have to say over at twitch.tv.
7864640	7865360	You okay over there?
7866160	7872320	Yeah, I just keep knocking into my thing and I'm showing my gym teacher Dean Winchester.
7873200	7873440	Okay.
7874240	7875120	To cleanse the palette.
7876880	7879680	Phoenix7726 says, well, Doug is no Reggie.
7881440	7884480	Questbuster says it's a celebration of sales numbers.
7885120	7887760	Sia Tabiri says, now I have Patty.
7887760	7890240	You're the mayonnaise for me stuck in my head.
7890240	7891040	You're welcome.
7891040	7895280	And for the record, that's the only kind of mayonnaise I tolerate is mayonnaise named Patty.
7896880	7898480	I like mayonnaise on a patty.
7898480	7901600	And sj100 matt says this isn't funny, Doug.
7903440	7908480	And sj100 matt says you get no points and may God have mercy on your soul, Doug.
7908560	7913520	I'm just gonna stick with okay, Doug.
7913520	7916160	That's now a thing, but it's a thing in my head.
7916160	7916880	It was a thing.
7916880	7918400	It was a thing I heard.
7918400	7918800	All right.
7919760	7921680	Thanks for letting us know, Doug.
7924000	7924400	All right.
7925200	7927840	Anyhow, let's get to the listener roundtable.
7927840	7934720	If you want to say, okay, Rob, I have a question for you or Jamie or Matt.
7934720	7935920	What's your question?
7935920	7937440	You can ask that now in our chat room.
7937520	7940960	It's the listener roundtable we have via chat and emails.
7940960	7942800	Every week we invite you guys to email us.
7942800	7945200	Participate at orangelandtrader.com.
7945200	7948640	If you'd like to send us an email letting us know your thoughts for the week.
7948640	7950480	I don't know if we had anything tonight,
7950480	7953840	but I will ask the queen of the mailbag dark Sakura what she found.
7955440	7956480	Oh, two emails.
7956480	7957680	And one of them is from me.
7958480	7959360	Oh, how nice.
7960160	7960400	Yep.
7961040	7961680	Hey, Jamie.
7961680	7963600	Just a follow-up email from last week.
7963600	7964880	See from me.
7964880	7966400	I finally started Animal Crossing.
7966480	7968880	I got to say I'm pretty hooked for some reason.
7968880	7972240	I am having an issue where the holiday ornaments will spawn in my trees.
7972240	7974080	So I can't craft any holiday stuff.
7974080	7977040	I've tried to time travel and try to fix it, but nothing.
7977040	7978080	Please don't time travel.
7978720	7982960	It seems like every video I find people who already have Isabella unlocked and I don't have her yet.
7984080	7986640	I guess she is the one who makes the holiday announcements.
7986640	7987120	True.
7987120	7987680	Any ideas?
7987680	7989520	I hope to visit your island soon and check it out.
7991280	7992320	Happy holidays, everyone.
7992320	7994160	This is from Frodo Swagons.
7994160	7996960	The thing is, is that you're not going to be able to do it yet in your own village.
7998320	8007360	You get the recipes after you have the town center and get more of the DIYs and stuff.
8007360	8008960	So you do need Isabel.
8009680	8017920	However, I would be more than happy to make you the things that I can if you want to.
8017920	8019680	I think I got your friend code.
8019760	8025040	Message me on Twitter, because that's really where I spend most of my social online time.
8025600	8027280	It's at Dark Sakura.
8027280	8028400	S-A-K-U-R-A.
8029680	8037680	And we'll work out a time for you to come over and shake my trees, get my ornaments.
8037680	8039600	That's very nice of you to offer.
8039600	8043520	But yeah, that was to say, that's what my gut was saying, too.
8043520	8048000	Even though I haven't played Animal Crossing in a few months, I've abandoned my poor villagers.
8048720	8051200	You probably got roaches in your house.
8051200	8051700	Probably.
8053680	8054180	What?
8054640	8060720	I was just gonna say, it's probably the whole, like, it takes 10 days or is it 14 to really
8060720	8061920	get your town up and running.
8061920	8066400	And that's probably the issue is that that time gating in the beginning is probably stopping
8066400	8067760	all the events from unlocking.
8067760	8071680	Unfortunately, it's just not a great time to start, unfortunately.
8071680	8076880	But you have a great answer there is that if you can't do it in your town, you go to
8076880	8077760	someone else's town.
8078400	8080320	You get to do a full cycle of the year, though.
8080320	8084240	The thing is that you're still not going to be able to get those DIYs unless someone gives
8084240	8084740	them to you.
8085360	8087600	And I think you're only getting one per.
8088400	8093760	So if I happen to somehow get any, because I make Dan give me all the ones that he finds
8093760	8098720	because I haven't been able to find any myself, let me know.
8098720	8100080	I will save what I can for you.
8100720	8105200	Catch snowflakes in the meantime, if you can catch snowflakes in your early village.
8105760	8113680	And I'll make you like a snowflake door ornament or a few things that I can with the, you know,
8113680	8118960	like a ski wall or something or an iceberg floor, something like that.
8119520	8123440	I'm still wanting more of those like the holiday decor.
8123440	8126800	I mean, even though it's like not my fucking holiday, I'm kind of sick of it already.
8128000	8129760	Not saying that other people enjoy it.
8129760	8131840	I just don't like the Jesus stuff.
8132400	8136160	Um, but I like trees and I like lights and I like all of that.
8136160	8141360	So if anyone also gets those recipes and do you do what some of my friends do and call
8141360	8142480	them a Hanukkah bush?
8142480	8144560	Because I always thought that was no, I do not know.
8144560	8146880	That's honestly the stupidest thing I've ever heard of.
8147680	8148720	I had a friend who did that.
8148720	8149440	I thought it was funny.
8150080	8155600	Oh, the thing is, is that and I actually kind of got into it on my Facebook with somebody
8155600	8161760	about that big house that was lit up for Hanukkah is that it's kind of like Hanukkah is not
8161760	8162800	a big holiday.
8162800	8164400	It's like pretty tiny.
8165280	8173440	And on top of that, it's like, it's kind of not the best thing to try to turn a holiday
8173440	8179920	that has nothing in common with, you know, Christmas or all the shit that goes with Christmas
8179920	8181040	into something that it's not.
8182160	8182720	I get it.
8182720	8183280	Yeah.
8183280	8185600	Like, you know, it's, it's, it's,
8185600	8187440	this only happened because of kids, right?
8187440	8190800	They didn't want kids to feel left out during this, during this part of the year.
8191520	8193040	And non-practicing Jews.
8193040	8193760	Yeah, I get it.
8193760	8194240	I get it.
8194240	8197520	But the other thing too, is it like, there's this whole commandment about assimilation
8197520	8198880	and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
8198880	8203920	Um, because I mean, technically, if you're looking at Christmas, it's a pagan holiday
8203920	8206000	that was co-opted by early Christians.
8207200	8216480	So just saying, you know, um, but at the same time, uh, Hanukkah is, I think the only celebrated
8216480	8219200	holiday that is not at all in Torah.
8219840	8221520	It came from the book of the Maccabees.
8222080	8227280	And that was, it's more biblical Apocrypha instead of actual Torah.
8227280	8229920	And there's your Judaism lesson of the season.
8229920	8230320	Thank you.
8231040	8231520	All right.
8232080	8234960	But I like it because I can set shit on fire and eat potatoes.
8234960	8240400	Who knew that an Animal Crossing email would set the only year on Orange L'Andrea.
8240400	8241040	Next email.
8242720	8243280	All right.
8243280	8246160	But yeah, Frodo Zwagens just messaged me on Twitter.
8246160	8253520	Anyway, um, the only other email that we got is Dear OLR, I hope you are all well and managing
8253520	8258160	to stay in chipper spirits, even if we may not be able to spend the holidays with companies
8258160	8259440	would want to this year.
8259440	8262480	Personally, this year has been a good time to escape to video games.
8262480	8266720	I found myself lately not wanting to leave a game behind right after beating it, which
8266720	8268240	brings me to my question.
8268240	8272160	Are there any games you found yourself so invested in you made it a point to 100% to
8272160	8272960	complete them?
8273600	8279040	In the last couple of days, I got the platinum trophy for God of War, my second platinum
8279040	8281520	as my first was Nier Automata.
8282880	8287200	This game was an interesting case because when I started it, I was very half interested.
8287200	8289360	I thought it would be a slog to get through it.
8289360	8293600	And then the story started to really draw me in once some new characters were introduced
8293600	8296960	and the world took on a scale I had previously underestimated.
8296960	8301440	I felt the need to explore all of it, taking on some challenging bosses in the process
8301440	8303200	that were incredibly thrilling to fight.
8304560	8308320	I will go ahead and pause at that point in the email and say I was like that with Mass
8308320	8308720	Effect.
8308720	8311520	And then I started doing boundary breaks and trying to see actually how the game was put
8311520	8312020	together.
8313040	8316160	But I never bothered for platinums on anything.
8316160	8319600	I usually like, you know, I jump from one game to another.
8319600	8320960	I've talked about that a lot on this show.
8320960	8325040	It's not often that I get in that mode where I'm like, I will do everything I possibly
8325040	8325840	can in this game.
8326400	8330480	Oddly enough, the MMOs kind of end up working that way for me, even though I'll never
8330480	8331120	reach the end.
8331680	8334960	It's kind of one of those that's and that's maybe why I don't have all the platinum
8334960	8336160	trophies to show for it.
8336160	8337760	As you guys, oftentimes it's the MMOs.
8338480	8342480	But I remember one distinctly was Diablo 3 when that came out.
8342480	8343680	That was your jam for a while.
8343680	8344400	Oh, my God.
8344400	8345520	Like, I don't know what happened.
8345520	8347920	I was just like, I will get a platinum in this fucking game.
8347920	8349200	I will get that trophy.
8349200	8349760	And I did.
8350400	8352400	And then they decided to release more trophies.
8352400	8356880	So it's funny, even though I have the platinum trophy in Diablo 3, I do not have all the
8356880	8360160	trophies because I never bought the Necromancer expansion on PlayStation.
8360720	8362880	So it's kind of one of those interesting little.
8363520	8367200	Oh, I got I got something that I really shouldn't have because I don't have every trophy.
8368000	8377440	But I did this time kick for a little while where I was trying to get different different
8377440	8378400	weird achievements.
8378400	8384720	And well, remember when I was trying to get, like, the book achievements and getting, like,
8384720	8389600	different like masking potions or whatever to make it into, you know, or sneaking in
8389600	8391040	through the sewers to get to.
8393120	8394880	Why can't I think the under city?
8394880	8396480	Yeah, that's a great example, though.
8396480	8397840	Achievements in the MMOs.
8397840	8403040	I do hunt that stuff because, you know, in like in WoW, you would get titles or maybe
8403040	8404720	little pets for certain ones.
8404720	8406400	And it's the same thing of Final Fantasy.
8406400	8408720	Like, there's a lot of minions as your title.
8408720	8409680	Yeah, exactly.
8409680	8412560	So, yeah, I hunt that stuff in MMOs all the time.
8412560	8415760	So I just like the really the really fun, crazy ones.
8415760	8420320	But the challenging one for me was getting all of the on an alliance character, getting
8420320	8421920	the reading material and under city.
8422800	8423600	Loki, what about you?
8423600	8425040	Is there anything where you sat down?
8425040	8427040	You said I will fully complete this game.
8428640	8430880	There's I don't know.
8430880	8437440	Like, I think maybe like a lot of the Lego games all end up getting everything in.
8439520	8441440	I don't know if I've done it for Saints Row, though.
8441440	8444640	I think there's been some tedious missions that I haven't been able to do.
8444640	8448560	And then there's also some stuff I think we have to play the game fully co-op, which
8448560	8449440	I haven't done.
8451920	8456080	And also in some games like Saints Row 2, it's impossible because a lot of it had its
8456080	8460000	humans that had to do with online play, which doesn't exist anymore.
8460000	8460500	So.
8462400	8465040	Yeah, I think it's just mainly like the Lego games and stuff.
8467520	8470240	All right, moving on with the email, then.
8470240	8473440	Actually, though, I did have another one that I'm kind of doing it in, and that is Animal
8473440	8473940	Crossing.
8474960	8479360	Not necessarily their achievements, but there are a lot of I'm trying to finish like some
8479360	8480960	of the Nook Mile stuff.
8482320	8483200	For the Nook Points.
8484320	8488080	So like the redecorating my house a certain number of times, catching certain fish, and
8488080	8490080	I'm trying to fill out my inventory.
8490080	8498080	So I want to have as complete of a catalog as I can and try to get all the fish and all
8498080	8504560	of the I already have like a full museum for my fossils, but I want all the artwork.
8504560	8510160	So it's more like a personal one for me, but I also get my Nook achievements with it.
8510160	8515040	So great example, because Animal Crossing and Nintendo in general doesn't have platinum
8515040	8520320	trophies or achievements, but it has its own kind of system built into the game.
8520320	8521920	So you're kind of working on that.
8521920	8526960	Yeah, I kind of don't really give a shit about it, like on a system level, if that makes
8526960	8531840	sense, like I don't really care about any character or personal achievement, because
8531840	8535600	honestly, my life is worth more than what a video game tells me it is.
8536560	8540640	So, but for me, this is just something fun that I do to add a little bit more replayability
8540640	8541600	to the game.
8541600	8548800	So to continue on with the email, this year also has had me return to older games to 100%
8548800	8549600	them.
8549600	8554560	I did things like finally getting all 100 gold skulltulas in Ocarina of Time, as well
8554560	8558960	as getting the 120 stars in the Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Galaxy.
8558960	8560960	Anyway, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
8560960	8564000	Season's greetings and many game beatings, Garth Wolf.
8564000	8565440	I love that.
8565440	8566640	I'm stealing that dude.
8566640	8567760	Many game beatings.
8567760	8568260	Love that.
8568800	8570800	I am actually putting that on my freaking Twitter.
8572240	8574800	That is like the coolest thing that I've seen all day.
8574800	8575520	All right.
8575520	8576320	Thanks for the email.
8577600	8578480	Yeah, thanks Garth.
8579840	8580960	Party on Garth.
8580960	8586480	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for the future here
8586480	8587280	on the show.
8587280	8588240	Let me get to chat.
8588240	8590160	I thought I saw a question way back.
8590160	8592880	We started talking about the, oh, here we go.
8592880	8595200	No one special with a round table question for us tonight.
8595200	8599200	With all the miscellaneous storefronts having started their holiday sales or about to start
8599200	8603680	them, are any of you planning on getting that one game that you've been eyeing for a while
8603680	8604000	now?
8604000	8605920	If you are, what game?
8605920	8608880	Oh, I know no one special loves to talk about sales and discounts.
8609840	8610800	Good question though.
8610800	8614320	Is there something I've been holding out for on a particular sale?
8615440	8621120	I've had, this may shock you, but there's like just a lot of weird shit has been, 2020
8621120	8622400	has like warped my mind.
8622960	8626640	So like all of a sudden I'm super into the Pokemon mainline games.
8626640	8627760	When was that going to happen?
8627760	8628320	Right.
8628320	8632640	But the other thing I've had my eye on, I kind of really want to get Mortal Kombat 11.
8633600	8640080	So I'm waiting for like the rights, like, but I want the all in one and done package,
8640080	8643760	like all the characters, all the story.
8643760	8648720	I want one fucking game with it all, which I think is just Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate,
8648720	8649840	if I'm not mistaken.
8649840	8653760	So I'm kind of waiting that to hit the sweet spot and then I'll probably pick it up and
8653760	8655600	look away when the fatalities happen.
8655600	8658480	But I mean, as a fighter game, those games are really solid fighters.
8659040	8663040	Um, and I'll wait for an injustice, which will be more up my alley.
8664080	8667840	So, um, that's my answer to that.
8667840	8669920	Anything you guys are holding out on a good sale for?
8674240	8676880	Some stuff I want is actually on sale right now.
8676880	8682480	Um, on Steam, um, it's just, it's hard for me to sit down and play anything on my computer
8682480	8684400	with some of the back problems I've been having lately.
8685040	8689760	Um, but like Wadham just got its release and I really wanted to play that.
8690640	8693840	Um, and, uh, Death Stranding is on sale.
8693840	8695600	Hold on, I'm actually looking at my wishlist right now.
8696400	8701440	Um, because I got, yeah, Detroit Become Human actually, I think was on sale briefly, but
8701440	8705120	yeah, Wadham is on and it's on sale for like 10 bucks.
8705760	8706260	Nice.
8707040	8707540	Purchased.
8708340	8715300	Um, Epic store has given out those $10 gift card or $10, uh, discounts or whatever.
8715300	8720740	And basically if you downloaded city skylines, which is free, um, you got 10 bucks.
8721300	8722820	So I don't know.
8722820	8729300	I was looking at, um, that last, the harmonics game that you just released, but yeah, fuser.
8729300	8729860	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8729860	8731060	I've been looking at it too.
8731060	8733060	It's still like, it's still $49.
8734020	8738260	And like, I looked at all the DLC and stuff and I'm like, eh, that's so expensive.
8738260	8740340	So I may wait on that.
8740340	8746820	So, you know how I said I really wanted to do a, um, uh, make a, uh, visual novel.
8748340	8751860	And, you know, visual novel maker is like for the whole thing is like 70 bucks.
8751860	8752980	Oh, is it on sale?
8753700	8755460	75% off.
8756340	8757140	You better get on that.
8757940	8758440	Yeah.
8758900	8759400	Nice.
8759400	8760520	I'm going to go broke.
8760520	8763480	So maybe my, my book will end up being a visual novel.
8763480	8766600	If, uh, somebody wants to help me with your artwork.
8766600	8767100	Nice.
8767100	8771080	Ooh, I should look in some of that, um, game making software, even though we all know I
8771080	8772600	don't have the attention span to do it.
8772600	8775560	I'm always kind of looking at that stuff, uh, on steam.
8775560	8779240	I'm sure a lot of it's, uh, going on deep discount here and Alan probably has.
8781000	8783720	I would just wait for like humble bundles, man.
8783720	8787000	They've got so many things that they offer on there.
8787560	8792520	Um, like discounts for different, like game making things and like tools.
8792520	8797080	In fact, that that's where I was going right now is I was trying to see and like, do I
8797080	8798360	have that already?
8798360	8801000	Because I very well may have that already.
8801000	8804600	I'm going to, I'm actually going to, I'm going to ask Alan real quick.
8804600	8806200	Cause he's a big PC gamer.
8806200	8812040	Um, I won't make him come on cam cause he's not dressed for it, but, um, he just gave
8812040	8813880	me this look that was really funny.
8813880	8815720	Is there any, yes, I am right.
8815720	8821800	Is there any steam sale, any steam game that you're looking forward to since, you know,
8821800	8824760	you're, you're playing Skyrim again right now.
8824760	8827640	That's, you know, games like what, 10 years old at this point.
8827640	8832120	Um, is there anything you've kind of been waiting for the right sale on a game before
8832120	8833160	you finally jump into it?
8834680	8838120	He's thinking Witcher three, maybe he's suggesting.
8838680	8839080	Yeah.
8839080	8842200	I mean, you know, now the CD project reds finally moved on.
8842200	8843720	They got a whole other problem.
8843720	8846360	I think it's safe to say nothing further will be done on Witcher threes.
8846360	8846840	There's that.
8846840	8847320	Okay.
8847320	8847820	Yeah.
8848280	8854040	There's a, there's actually some pretty interesting sales, like moonlighter, uh, vigil, uh, resident
8854040	8856200	evil resistance, oxygen not included.
8856200	8857880	Those all seem to be on sale.
8860440	8860920	All right.
8860920	8861420	Neat.
8862280	8862780	All right.
8863400	8867480	Well, if that's it, then I think we're getting down to last minute stories.
8867480	8871720	I don't know if we have any of those before we wrap it all up, uh, dark soccer or Loki.
8872280	8872600	Yeah.
8872600	8873100	Yeah.
8874120	8874620	Yeah.
8875080	8879160	So let's talk back about, uh, cyberpunk again.
8879160	8880520	Oh, apparently cyberpunk.
8881160	8882840	Cyberpunk has a problem.
8884040	8885400	They have a dildo problem.
8886280	8892360	Distracting number of dildos are apparently appearing in the game as a problem or feature
8894360	8899640	both little call may little call and be surrounded by dicks all the time.
8899640	8900440	I mean, seriously.
8901240	8907800	So apparently they're going to be fine tuning that to see if they can, um, uh, tone it down
8907800	8910280	a bit, but yeah, it is.
8910280	8913640	It's something, well, in certain districts in the game, they have like a red light district
8913640	8919640	that, you know, that stuff's everywhere, but yeah, it's, it's silly.
8922040	8922680	All right.
8922680	8924760	Anything else besides dildo updates?
8925640	8926440	That's it.
8926440	8926680	All right.
8926680	8928440	Oh, well, that's a good note to end on.
8928440	8928940	All right.
8929900	8931500	Let's wrap it up then.
8931500	8934460	Uh, final thoughts and good night time.
8934460	8938780	So, um, thank you guys, of course, as always for listening to the show, uh, downloading
8938780	8941580	our show or listening live, however you consume the show.
8941580	8943100	Thank you so much for doing that.
8943100	8945180	Uh, and, uh, please help us spread the word.
8945180	8950300	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need the, the, the voices out there,
8950300	8952700	uh, to come join us on the show.
8952700	8956700	So help us spread the word, tell a friend or two about the show, leave us a nice review
8956700	8960220	wherever it is you found the show and, uh, really appreciate that.
8960220	8966940	And of course, um, since we don't have another show until I think the 26th, no 27th will
8966940	8971420	be the next show, um, have, have a good holiday, whether it already passed or whether it's
8971420	8973980	upcoming, uh, hope everybody's having a good holiday.
8973980	8977100	And I know everybody's kind of starting their vacations too.
8977100	8981580	Um, please be safe, uh, just because there is a vaccine that doesn't mean the pandemic
8981580	8981980	is over.
8982620	8984460	Um, they're giving it to all the rich people.
8984460	8985180	Yes, that's true.
8985180	8986620	They're giving it to all the rich people first.
8987340	8990460	Um, so please, uh, please stay safe.
8990460	8992620	Um, I'm not doing anything for the holidays this year.
8992620	8993820	We canceled all our plans.
8993820	8995580	I don't want to do anything.
8995580	8999980	So, um, you know, uh, I'll be catching up on some games, maybe try to pour some of that
8999980	9001660	energy into creative stuff.
9001660	9005180	Um, maybe try to make some more, you know, videos on demand and things like that.
9005180	9005900	We'll see.
9005900	9007660	Um, so just be safe guys.
9007660	9010300	Uh, anyway, let's get everybody's actual final thoughts here.
9010300	9016940	Um, I guess I pretty much gave mine, but I will elaborate and say, oh, this holiday
9016940	9020220	would be a great time to start a marathon game of civilization.
9020220	9021500	I think maybe that's something I'll do.
9021500	9023260	Cause I actually have the time to do it.
9023260	9025100	Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?
9025980	9027980	Uh, just gonna be working more on my game.
9027980	9030780	So I'm keep, keep on working on that.
9031660	9032300	Great.
9032300	9034540	And last but not least, Stark soccer, your final thought.
9034540	9042700	I attempted to give you a Duolingo, uh, uh, subscription for Japanese.
9043340	9043660	Nah.
9043660	9045500	Um, I don't know.
9045500	9048140	Um, actually I do have one.
9048140	9049660	Be kind to people.
9049660	9053660	Don't assume that just because someone looks like they're able-bodied, that they're not
9053660	9058060	dealing with some difficulty or disability or something really hard in their life.
9058700	9060220	Um, just be kind.
9060780	9061260	That's all.
9061260	9061900	Be kind.
9062460	9063420	Be kind to other people.
9063420	9064460	Be kind to yourself.
9065340	9065740	All right.
9066540	9069660	Or as my mom would say, can't you be fucking nice.
9069660	9070380	It's Christmas.
9071020	9071420	No, no, no.
9071420	9074780	There's a difference between being nice and being kind.
9074780	9075420	No, I got you.
9075420	9076140	I got you.
9076140	9078380	Being kind also means fucking fight.
9079340	9082300	I couldn't help but think of that in the spirit of the holiday.
9082300	9083420	What my mom used to say.
9083420	9083740	All right.
9083740	9084940	Your mom was cool.
9084940	9085660	Yeah.
9085660	9086300	All right.
9086300	9087180	Anyway, that's it.
9087180	9088700	We're going to have a great night.
9088700	9089340	Great week.
