0	13240	This week, the never-ending flame wars and battle of console supremacy continues!
13240	16640	It's a new console generation, and I hope you have the console where your friends play
16640	17640	and library exists.
17640	21000	After all, it's your choice for your own reasons.
21000	24760	Never forget the immoral words of your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki that
24760	28040	a console is only as good as the games that are on it, which this generation includes
28040	31280	the games you previously owned still being compatible on the new consoles.
31280	34280	We'll discuss this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show
34280	37280	where every gamer has a voice.
37280	45640	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where
45640	48160	every gamer has a voice.
48160	53160	We are back once again with another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
53160	59600	Live tonight with episode number 844 of our show for November the 22nd of 2020.
59600	63660	My name is Rob Roberts, and I am joined by my co-hosts.
63660	67120	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
67120	68120	Hello.
68120	70240	Hi, how are you?
70240	71240	I'm well.
71240	72240	Good.
72240	74200	I'm going to come back to you in a minute though, because we have some more stuff to
74200	75200	discuss.
75200	76200	Exactly.
76200	77200	Okay.
77200	78200	Say hello.
78200	81300	And I said before the show I was going to do it differently, but 18-year-old habits
81300	82860	are hard to break.
82860	86140	So please also say hello to Techmaster Loki.
86140	87980	Hey, how's it going?
87980	88980	Hey, good.
88980	89980	How are you?
89980	90980	Doing all right.
90980	91980	Good.
91980	92980	What's that game behind you tonight?
92980	93980	Was that Uniracers?
93980	94980	It's kind of what it looks like.
94980	95980	It is Uniracers.
95980	96980	Rad.
96980	99460	I was refreshing it because there was a nice banner ad for some sort of, I see a berry
99460	100460	thing.
100460	101460	I was like, nope.
101460	102460	All right.
102460	103460	Well, that's okay.
103460	104460	That's okay.
104460	105460	Oh, that's another banner ad.
105460	106460	Cool.
106460	107460	That's the Nintendo 64 version.
107460	108460	Isn't it?
108460	109460	I don't know if I ever played.
109460	110460	Super Nintendo.
110460	111460	Okay.
111460	112460	It is Super Nintendo.
113060	114060	Is it Uniracers 64?
114060	115060	Am I making that up?
115060	116060	No.
116060	117060	Then you're making that up.
117060	118060	I am totally making that up.
118060	119060	Why did I think there was a second Uniracers game?
119060	121780	Maybe you're thinking of Excitebike.
121780	122780	Was it on Game Boy?
122780	123780	I don't know.
123780	127540	No, I'm definitely not thinking of Excitebike.
127540	130340	I don't remember if there was a Game Boy version of Uniracers.
130340	134820	There might've been, but no, it was only on Super Nintendo.
134820	136540	All right.
136540	140180	Before we get into our kickoff topic tonight, which is going to be about a game we've talked
140180	142140	about a little bit on this show before.
142820	146560	I want to go back to Dark Sakura tonight because we've been talking the past couple of weeks
146560	155700	about you are a fan of the show Supernatural, which has a pretty impressive run.
155700	164460	It's not quite as impressive as the run of this show at 18 years, but 15 years, great
164460	171580	minds think like me, 15 years of a one TV show is certainly no slouch.
172380	176340	You and I were talking a little bit before the show tonight, a finale was met with some
176340	180700	mixed kind of feelings.
180700	183340	By the way, on cam, I have baby.
183340	184340	I don't even know what that is.
184340	187580	Do they have a Batmobile type of thing?
187580	188580	Is that what that is?
188580	189580	It's the Impala.
189580	190580	It's the baby.
190580	192180	I think I've maybe ever seen one episode.
192180	197820	It's a lot to catch up on, but I will say Dark Sakura, it wasn't your endorsement that
197820	200020	made me want to watch Supernatural.
200020	203580	Do you know who endorsed Supernatural that now I want to watch it?
203580	204580	Stacey Abrams.
204580	212420	Well, yeah, I think the entire fandom let out a big gasp when they found she was a fan.
212420	215740	She's clearly a sci-fi nerd and I'm living for it.
215740	216740	Yeah, totally.
216740	223540	I've really been enjoying following her on Twitter lately, but yeah, my favorite show
223540	230260	that I've watched since the first episode that a lot of the milestones I've had as a
230260	235340	host of Orange Lounge Radio, I have had as a fan of Supernatural as well, including getting
235340	243500	married and losing a cat and getting another cat and all of our milestones.
243500	249860	I'd also like to say that for me, because I'm only a couple of years older than Jensen
249860	255660	Ackles who plays Dean, that I have grown up with the characters and so it was kind
255660	262500	of for me watching the characters grow as people and me growing, it made logical sense.
262500	264100	I could stay with that aspect.
264100	265100	Does that make sense?
265100	266100	Oh yeah, no, absolutely.
266100	270460	You know, and somebody, I had tweeted a little plug for the show tonight as I tend to do
270460	273900	on my personal Twitter account and somebody was kind enough to reply.
273900	276860	It was Sy Coon on Twitter replied and said, do you remember that name?
276860	281060	I remember from chat a long time ago said, oh, LR was a formative part of my youth and
281060	282420	I still love them to pieces.
282420	284020	Go have a listen pals.
284020	289540	And I was like, oh, that's, that's why I still do this shit every week is nice comments like
289540	290540	that.
290540	291540	It's very kind.
291540	294180	I do also want to introduce our chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night
294180	298500	at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash
298500	299500	vog network.
299500	301660	And you guys can participate along with our show.
301660	307580	First comment tonight from Kevin DDR who says, oh, LR outlasting supernatural is truly
307580	309300	an accomplishment.
309300	310300	Thank you.
310300	311860	At the end, there can be only one.
311860	314620	So there's another like big thing that's happening next week.
314620	319820	So the ready player twos coming out and I was reading, I was like trying to re read
319820	322580	some reviews on it and they're all, yeah, it's nine years in the making.
322580	328620	Like it's been nine years or he's cheese, but time flies.
328620	329620	Seriously.
329620	335060	Um, yeah, I was just going to ask you because we were talking a little bit before the show
335060	339020	about supernatural and kind of the fandom reaction and, and you know, I know this is
339020	344500	a show about video games, but I definitely saw some parallels, uh, in a not great way,
344500	348060	unfortunately, to kind of what you were talking about with some of the stuff in the supernatural
348060	351420	fandom and things that we've seen in the gaming fandom.
351420	356500	And you know, we're talking about history and things that have changed in 15 years or
356500	360260	18 years, depending on what show we're talking about right now.
360260	366980	Um, one of those things that is kind of better and worse is the fact that you can reach out
366980	370020	to people so instantaneously on social media.
370020	373220	I mean, when this show started, we didn't have Twitter and some of that stuff.
373220	374820	And in some ways they, thank gosh.
374820	375820	Right.
375820	377100	But Jamie, you want to elaborate on that a little bit?
377100	380060	Like what's, what's the supernatural fandom going through?
380620	388540	Well, a lot of people are, are kind of up in arms over the ending, um, that, you know,
388540	392940	there were characters slighted that the way that it ended in shit, I really don't want
392940	399460	to spoil it, but the way that it was ended, denied certain aspects of characters that
399460	406180	it ruined character arcs and, and me, I personally, I don't see that I, I thought it was, it was
406180	408820	right the way that it ended.
408820	415860	But we've now had so much, just, I don't even have a word for it.
415860	421260	Just people who have been, we've gone from the flat out and I'm looking at some of it
421260	426020	as grief, you know, cause people keep, people can grieve over the stuff that they love that
426020	430860	that's appropriate, but I'm, you know, we still have a lot of the denial and, Oh, it
430860	434420	should have been this way and let's petition to have their, their, the petitions already
434420	435420	out by the way.
435420	441220	Um, but like one of my favorite actors who was just a glorious human being, Jim Beaver,
441220	447820	he was chased off of Twitter because, you know, and I don't even think that a lot of
447820	456140	what was going at him was, uh, was necessarily badly worded or attacking, but it was so many,
456140	457260	you know what I mean?
457260	462660	When you have a lot of people saying the same thing and not all of them are mature about
462660	465020	it, it'll really come across as bullying.
465020	466020	It's overwhelming.
466020	467020	Yeah.
467020	472500	Um, and um, you know, people are now going on IMDB and leaving poor reviews.
472500	477780	And the thing with that is that a lot of them are making light of mental illness and suicide
477780	482580	and every last one of them I've run across, I have reported because you don't fuck with
482580	483580	those topics.
483580	484580	You do not.
484580	489220	Um, but especially when I have friends that would be with me today, if they hadn't taken
489220	490220	their lives.
490220	502660	Um, there, uh, there've been just, just anywhere from just, you know, basic whining to really
502660	503660	good conversation.
503660	508500	The really good conversation is what I have been, uh, been happiest with.
508500	517580	Um, and, uh, there have also been, I'd say discussions about, you know, really good discussions
517580	523380	that have come out about sexuality, about, um, representation, you know, arguing out
523380	531420	against the kill your gays trope, which, um, I, I half see it and half don't, and I can
531420	532420	go into that.
532420	538180	Um, when I post my blog post, um, because there's going to be a blog post, I actually
538180	540180	could not post Friday night.
540180	544580	Um, well, cause number one, um, I was in Reno.
544580	548220	I'm sure there's many blog posts that are being written about the finale, not just,
548220	549220	you know, I wasn't in Reno.
549220	550420	I just come back from Reno.
550420	556020	Um, but, but no, I am going to be, because also some of my perspective on it does come,
556020	563980	I think a little bit just from being autistic that I don't, I have an emotional investment,
563980	566900	but not an emotional expectation, if that makes sense.
566900	572980	I'm really looking at it more as the, the details as opposed to what emotion it evoked.
572980	573980	Does that make sense?
574380	579860	So it was like, how I feel about it is irrelevant in regards to how it actually was.
579860	584100	And so my feelings are in that region.
584100	586780	Let me get some comments from our chat over Twitch TV slash VOG network.
586780	590820	Um, Sia Tabiri in chat says, if anyone is really that sore about things, they could
590820	593860	always look for screen manipulations or fan fix.
593860	597220	You know, um, I think that's an interesting way to kind of deal with it.
597220	600820	And the way I would prefer to see people deal with it rather than bullying is that if you
600820	603140	don't like the ending, write your own damn ending.
603140	606660	I mean, it's not going to do anything to change what happened on TV, but at least you kind
606660	608260	of release that from your system.
608260	611180	And that's something you can share with other people who can then choose to accept it or
611180	612180	reject it.
612180	614420	You know, that's, that's the great things about stories.
614420	617260	You can either let it affect you or not.
617260	618260	Right.
618260	620300	Well, and see, that's the thing.
620300	627380	And for me, I'm, I'm very, I'm not, you know, the big thing was the Destiel shippers, right?
627380	631740	You know, uh, Dean and Castiel, which I'm not one of them.
631740	636500	I mean, if, if it ended up had being a hundred percent canon, then, okay, cool.
636500	641500	You know, I didn't see it coming, you know, maybe one-sidedly, but it is what it is.
641500	647860	Um, I also don't get whatever subtext that people are pointing at, but again, that could
647860	649660	just be because I'm autistic.
649660	653260	We don't really usually get that kind of subtext.
653260	659420	I mean, just as people, you know, um, but I thought that within the scope of what they
659420	662020	had available, it was, it was very well done.
662020	663020	I was pleased with it.
663020	668500	I was satisfied and I cried like a baby, which is great because, and I might've even mentioned
668500	669500	it in the past.
669500	674560	I haven't really been able to cry even after my dad died, um, with everything going on.
674560	676740	It just would not come out.
676740	684220	And like with, uh, with episode 18, I could cry some with episode 20, I bawled and every
684220	688620	time I go back and watch any scene, I, I cry.
688620	691140	And it's been really good for me because now I know what to do.
691140	696300	If I need to cry, I just go back and watch some of those scenes, you know, um,
696300	700780	Isn't that interesting when, when art evokes that type of response because, you know, going
700780	705080	to games and not to spoil my gaming week, but surprise, I was playing No Man's Sky this
705080	708740	week and it was a very random thing that happened in the game, but it was something that made
708740	710140	me think about my mom.
710140	714380	And I did start like welling up a little bit and, you know, I get through most days now
714380	719960	not crying, you know, that all kind of stopped in 2017 when she passed, but there's definitely
719960	724420	little moments in art that will evoke that type of response.
724420	729180	So it's interesting, you know, and, and that can also be TV shows or movies.
729180	734140	Even thinking about it right now, this is the first time I've actually talked to somebody
734140	739220	verbally that is not Dan and, and Dan's not like the biggest fan of the show.
739220	743300	He's caught episodes with me, but you know, we, we had to talk about it.
743300	747380	But I found his observations to be astute.
747380	753260	But the biggest thing I kept thinking of reading everything on, on Twitter, cause I've basically
753260	756900	I've been living on Twitter lately just because I've noticed you've, you've had an increased
756900	759820	Twitter presence from where we were a year ago for sure.
759820	762780	And I actually really, really enjoy the platform a lot more.
762780	763940	I don't really do the list so much.
763940	769220	I kind of like the randomness to come to me and then I check on certain people in person.
769220	776140	But for, for me, the biggest parallel that would just really struck out to me was the
776140	781380	Mass Effect 3 ending, how people acted about that to the point where they actually did
781380	790900	go in and do a revised-ish ending, you know, have the various endings for it.
790900	800100	And I just thought that it was, I just, it just seemed like, Hey, I've, I've heard this
800100	801100	song before.
801100	805260	I've seen the same exact thing happen.
805260	813180	And you know I was actually really happy enough and lucky enough that I could attend some
813180	817420	of the, the Q and A panels that Creation Entertainment has done in light of not being able to have
817420	818420	conventions.
818940	824020	They usually are the ones that run like the various supernatural cons.
824020	833700	And so today was the, the panel this morning with Misha Collins that played Castiel and
833700	838660	then with Jared Padlucki who played Sam.
838660	841020	And I really liked what they had to say about it.
841020	842260	I've recorded both of them.
842260	846860	I'm planning on making them available at some point.
846860	852420	But I really enjoyed the insights they got sort of behind the scenes as the actors behind
852420	857860	it and speaking of representation and, and how it went and talking about, you know, their
857860	863220	own feelings about the ending, which honestly I would a hundred percent see it.
863220	872620	And by the way, Brad, pod culture in chat, that actually I think was absolutely necessary.
872620	875900	Please elaborate for our podcast listeners who can't see chat.
875940	882460	He said the part I hated fucking rebar that a lot of people are kind of sticking on that
882460	883460	point.
883460	886460	And honestly enough, it's not the rebar that did it.
886460	887740	It's the attacker that did it.
887740	890980	It just happened to be there.
890980	897860	And so, which by the way is always how I, I saw that going.
897860	903660	And there's lots of parallels to something that happened in, I want to say season three.
903660	910500	Yeah, it was not season three, um, in, uh, in season two, um, but, uh, I won't go into
910500	911500	that here.
911500	912500	I won't go into that here.
912500	913500	Yeah.
913500	916300	Bobby suggesting you do a vog round table on the finale because clearly there's a lot
916300	917420	more to say.
917420	918420	I think you should do it.
918420	919420	Absolutely.
919420	920420	Get some people together.
920420	921420	Yeah.
921420	925700	Um, we'll, we'll, we'll see about that happening, um, when I don't have 50 million things going
925700	926700	on.
926700	928820	Can I get together a couple listener comments here and then we can move on?
928820	929820	Sure.
929820	931380	Um, so this must be one of your Twitter buddies.
931380	936340	I don't recognize this name, but SV writer 1000 says, I cried a lot also, LOL, or I'm
936340	937340	sorry.
937340	938340	I cried.
938340	939340	Also, I answered a word there.
939340	940340	LOL.
940340	941420	It was a long time coming for me and I'm going to miss this show.
941420	942420	So you're not alone.
942420	945140	I am a million percent with you on that.
945140	949380	I yeah, I'm tying it to games again a little bit.
949380	950380	SSG 100.
950380	954260	Matt says it's like folks attack the mass effect crew after they didn't like the ending
954260	957540	of three threats, downloading the game on platforms.
957540	961300	It's just not necessary, no matter how important a fandom it is to you.
961300	962300	Absolutely.
962300	965900	And I think that's probably the note we'd want to kind of try to wrap this up on is
965900	972420	that, you know, that these types of responses are just like, it's, it's too much, you know,
972420	977900	if you don't like something, okay, you know, but somebody else might've liked it, you know,
977900	978900	I don't know.
978900	979900	Yeah.
979900	983980	Well, and see, that, that's the thing is that right now I just watching the fandom in general
983980	989060	and you know, I've saw the same thing happening with mass effect that people are going through
989060	990300	the stages of grief.
990300	996340	I mean, eventually the acceptance is going to happen but you know, that's why I've been
996340	998380	really encouraging people.
998380	1001220	You know, I started writing a fanfic.
1001220	1005180	I mean, now my fanfic is within the set canon.
1005180	1011500	So it follows the ending as it portrayed on, on TV.
1011500	1017940	But for me, I'm working out a few things in my, in my fanfic.
1017940	1020220	I've already written a chapter of it.
1020220	1025900	I wrote that chapter in like, I banged that out in like a couple hours.
1025900	1032500	So it, I've seen some really beautiful fan art come of it.
1032500	1037540	I mean, the same thing happened, you know, I wrote my own fanfics for mass effect after
1037540	1038540	the end.
1038540	1045660	Cause to me, you know, my, my canon in mass effect for the ending is where Shepard lives,
1045660	1046660	you know?
1046660	1053420	And I wrote like what three, four different fanfics around that ending, you know?
1053420	1062260	So I really would encourage any any of my my Twitter buddies who are listening to the
1062260	1069020	podcast right now I would really encourage you that with your, with your feelings about
1069020	1073620	this, with how you're doing it, put it into something creative, which I do need to interject
1073620	1074620	one last thing.
1074620	1075620	All right.
1075620	1083860	That a bunch of fans, you know, in, you know that's what I'm thinking of just in their
1083860	1090420	reaction to wanting to do something when they could not do anything about the ending, right?
1090420	1096860	They gathered, they raised a lot of money for the Trevor project.
1096860	1101980	Like the goal was something like 800 bucks and it's now almost a 2000 nice.
1101980	1108700	And I'll find, I'll find the, the link to the charity but I, it's called like Castile
1108700	1109700	something.
1109700	1111180	I'll have to look it up again.
1111180	1118580	So I will find that again and I'll, I'll put it in the chat here and I'll see about reposting
1118580	1119580	it again on my Twitter.
1119580	1123700	I posted about it a few times, but to take the seat and that's what should have been
1123700	1124700	done with Mass Effect.
1124700	1129900	That should be done anytime the fandom is in arms and is upset about something.
1129900	1132760	Take your energy and funnel it into something positive.
1132760	1136980	I was just so proud of the Supernatural family for doing that.
1136980	1141280	I was just going to say it's interesting that you brought up specifically the Trevor project
1141280	1146300	because, um, I was, you know, just messing around on my new Xbox series X that I talked
1146300	1147960	about last week on the show.
1147960	1151840	And you know, Xbox has their own little like rewards app and rewards thing that you can
1151840	1152840	do.
1152840	1157840	Um, and one of the, uh, things that's in there right now is that you can spend 1000 points
1157840	1162640	to basically donate a dollar to the Trevor project and Microsoft will match that.
1162640	1165120	And specifically that charity is in there and was called out.
1165120	1167620	I noticed it was like a featured thing in the Xbox rewards app.
1167620	1169100	So I thought that was pretty cool.
1169100	1170100	Check that out.
1170100	1173400	And you can actually, they have a way you can earn a thousand points really easy just
1173400	1174880	by getting two achievements too.
1174880	1176960	So it's pretty cool.
1176960	1180640	So I found it, by the way, I'm going to put the link in the, in the chat cause it's kind
1180640	1185160	of a long one, but if you just look up the Castiel project, okay.
1185160	1186440	So I was actually wrong.
1186440	1191720	The goal was 1500 and we've raised $46,220 for the Trevor project.
1191720	1192720	Nice.
1192720	1193720	All right.
1193720	1194720	All right.
1194720	1201200	Well, blowing that out of the water by 40 by was 400%.
1201200	1202200	Almost 400%.
1202200	1203200	All right.
1203440	1204440	All right.
1204440	1206760	Well clearly you're going to need a three hour round table to get out all your thoughts
1206760	1208920	on the supernatural finale.
1208920	1215080	I'm just saying that, you know, my last piece is just do, do, do what these fans have done.
1215080	1216080	Funnel it into something good.
1216080	1217480	Funnel it into something good.
1217480	1221480	And that's a message that can be used on gaming and all that as well to kind of tie it back.
1221480	1222480	All right.
1222480	1223480	Indeed.
1223480	1230600	Well, speaking, speaking of gaming, sorry, choking live on air.
1230600	1236000	Um, Loki, why don't you take our kickoff topic story off my hands tonight, please?
1236000	1238400	Cause it's a game we talk a lot about on this show.
1238400	1239400	Yeah.
1239400	1244120	So Pokemon go had a major update that, uh, did a bunch of things.
1244120	1250520	So first off they added a level cap, um, they increased the level cap up to 50, which is
1250520	1251520	pretty awesome.
1251520	1257600	Um, they are also introducing seasons that change every three months, uh, which will
1257600	1263640	do introduce, I guess, new Pokemon, uh, exclusive to those seasons as well.
1263640	1273360	Um, and they're also introducing new monsters that were part of, uh, the Kalos region.
1273360	1275480	And so they've added a bunch of those as well.
1275480	1281240	Gen six, Pokemon X and Y, some of them sit with me here in the OLR studio actually, except
1281240	1284240	they're on the other side, so I can't grab them, but some of them are with me here in
1284240	1285240	the OLR studio.
1285240	1286560	It's those starters from X and Y.
1286600	1291720	So just kind of, uh, you know, all these updates all at once, and it's going to be coming out
1291720	1295240	on November 30th is when that's going to hit.
1295240	1297680	So I'm pretty cool.
1297680	1298680	Lots of cool stuff.
1298680	1304800	Um, they're also going to be a special badge if you have hit 40 already, uh, once the update
1304800	1307640	hits and you'll be able to get that.
1307640	1309820	So it's a legacy.
1309820	1318660	And then I guess starting December 2nd, they're also going to have, um, some special French,
1318660	1321020	uh, Pokemon as well.
1321020	1322020	Uh, Klefki.
1322020	1324460	Uh, yeah, it's like another regional.
1324460	1329580	You can only get it in France because that's what Pokemon X and Y was inspired by.
1329580	1332280	They did something similar for, um, New York city in Gen five.
1332280	1337380	There's like a bowl you can only get in New York city, um, or that area.
1337380	1338420	It's actually pretty generous.
1338420	1340380	It's not just New York city, but that area.
1340380	1341380	Yeah.
1341380	1343060	So it sounds exciting.
1343060	1347340	I turned it on the other day just to, cause I haven't played in a while.
1347340	1352740	So there was a few new Pokemon I was able to get, but still not really playing it.
1352740	1358260	Um, some of the requirements to get to level 50 are coming out already because the game
1358260	1363220	is, um, uh, already went live with that in like Australia or some parts of Australia
1363220	1366180	and some other parts of the world that always kind of get to test this type of stuff.
1366180	1371220	So of course, Reddit is all over the information gathering and all this stuff, just to give
1371220	1373780	you an idea of what it takes to get to level 41.
1373780	1374920	All right.
1374920	1380500	So to get to get from zero to 40, 20 million XP total will get you there.
1380500	1381500	All right.
1381500	1386980	So, but if you want to get to 41, you'll have to get that bar up to 26, you have to get
1386980	1392340	6 million more XP and you'll have to power up a legendary Pokemon 20 times.
1392340	1396140	Eh, you can do that, winning enough, winning enough raids and getting the rare candy.
1396140	1398220	Win 30 raids.
1398220	1399220	That's going to take a little time.
1399220	1401120	You got to find 30 raids to play.
1401120	1405700	If you're only using the free passes, that's going to take you a month.
1405700	1411620	And here's the big one, catch 200 Pokemon in a single day.
1411620	1414300	And that is the requirements to get to 41.
1414300	1415300	Don't we all have lives?
1415300	1421020	Well, I mean, I think I can do it with my Bluetooth, but this is definitely the kind
1421020	1424620	of thing where you would have to grind the game for like four or five hours just to get
1424620	1426620	to 41.
1426620	1430900	And you know, the interesting question is why?
1430900	1437860	Because anybody who's level 40 will be able to power up Pokemon all the way to level 50,
1437860	1440460	which will also be the new level cap for your Pokemon.
1440460	1445940	It used to be that you could only level Pokemon one level higher than you are now.
1445940	1449060	But now they're going to make it so that you can level Pokemon up to 10 levels higher than
1449060	1450120	you are now.
1450120	1458380	So really, the only point to get to level 41, 42, 43 and so forth is E-peen.
1458380	1460920	There's really not a lot of other point that I saw anyway.
1460920	1466040	I don't know, chatters, if you have an opinion on why would you even get to 50 outside of
1466040	1472300	showing off your, you know, pokey dick, then I'm curious what the reasons are, because
1472300	1474440	I'm not sure.
1474440	1480760	And just, you know, they only have the requirements up to level 46 right now, because level 46
1480760	1486400	has a take a snapshot of Pokemon seven days in a row requirement.
1486400	1488360	So it's it's time gated to a week.
1488360	1492380	So they like physically can't get past it yet to see what's beyond 46.
1492380	1498120	But do you know how much experience you need to get to level 46 82 million total?
1498120	1504680	No, not saying the game one to 20 is the end of the game right now.
1504680	1510880	You're going to have to go through the current game four times to get to level 46.
1510880	1516200	Now with as much as I've played Pokemon go on and off over the years, I've gone the one
1516200	1520320	through 40 twice, I have about 42 million XP.
1520320	1524880	That is just enough to get me to level 43 if I do all the tasks.
1524880	1525880	So I don't know.
1525880	1531560	I know like on one hand, the new levels sound interesting on the other, I feel like it's
1531560	1535720	an episode of whose line it is it anyway, where it's all made up and the points don't
1535720	1537040	matter.
1537040	1542220	To me, it sounds just like Ingress where like I got stuck not being able to level up to
1542220	1547400	another level because you had certain requirements that you have to hit, I could never hit him
1547400	1551520	to get enough silver badges or whatever gold badges.
1551520	1554180	So Oh, technically, that's in this I left that out.
1554180	1557380	But you're going to have to have a certain number of gold and now platinum there's new
1557380	1562700	badges coming platinum badges in order to be able to get to certain levels and it's
1562700	1565420	it didn't look too bad to me.
1565420	1566420	But I don't know.
1566420	1570300	I also have a lot of history and Pokemon go so whatever.
1570300	1573420	By the way, I guess I should mention this at some point since you brought up Ingress.
1573420	1574860	I haven't played Ingress in eight days.
1574860	1577900	I think I'm I think I'm kind of over it.
1577900	1579280	Some stuff happened.
1579280	1582660	And I'm just kind of like, what am I doing this for again?
1582660	1586980	Like Oh, yeah, it's been very motivating to go out and walk and do some of that other
1586980	1587980	stuff.
1587980	1590900	But honestly, like the game is getting stale.
1590900	1594180	It's hemorrhaging a lot of players.
1594180	1598300	And even though it's probably the player base is maybe a quarter of what it used to be at
1598300	1603020	one point, Niantic still can't seem to be able to police their own game and make sure
1603020	1604060	it's fair.
1604060	1607660	So I kind of hit a point where I'm like, I've had it yet.
1607660	1611220	I just turned right around and started playing Pokemon go so I get so it's like, I guess
1611220	1616020	I'm still kind of Niantic but my my thing is I'm not going to give it any money.
1616020	1618820	I'm done a different kind of game.
1618820	1622700	Well, you know what I do is they've got that whole Google app.
1622700	1624980	It's a Google rewards or whatever.
1624980	1629220	And so you take pictures of your receipts when you go shopping and of course they steal
1629220	1630220	your data that way.
1630220	1631500	But is that on iOS?
1631500	1633060	I always thought that was an Android only thing.
1633060	1634300	Oh, I don't know.
1634300	1635300	But it's on Android.
1635300	1638660	I've got like, I get like at least a buck a week.
1638660	1644620	So and it's just, you know, I could use it for in game stuff if I was actually playing
1644620	1650180	Pokemon go, but I don't so but it's a cheap way to do it.
1650180	1655420	Just I'll just I'll just be a bigger deck on the gym game and Pokemon go I've usually
1655420	1659300	been very passive in that game, but I'll get my 50 coins.
1659300	1662120	So Ingress taught me how to be a territorial dickhead.
1662120	1666420	So I'll do it.
1666420	1670540	Somebody tried it with me today and Pokemon God was feeding golden berries to their Pokemon
1670540	1671540	that was still in the gym.
1671540	1674860	Well, I noticed this person was in another gym down the street.
1674860	1677900	So I use the good old Ingers trick attack at once.
1677900	1681100	And while they're sitting there like waiting to recharge it when you attack it again, you
1681100	1683240	go take the other gym down the street.
1683240	1685220	And I fucking did it today is somebody.
1685220	1688100	So you know what?
1688100	1692260	I guess Niantic has unleashed the beast if nothing else will say that.
1692260	1696700	So also don't knock my I would have never done it if this person had to knock me out
1696700	1698980	of a gym in less than 10 minutes.
1698980	1701900	I didn't get a single coin from the gym because they knocked me right out and I was like oh
1701900	1703180	hell no.
1703180	1708500	So yeah act deft and chat says territorial asshole the game.
1708500	1710980	Fifth Dream says territorial asshole goose game.
1710980	1716660	I'm sure the person I am like completely asserting dominance over is probably like a 13 year
1716660	1718140	old.
1718140	1720500	But you know what kid life's not fair.
1720500	1723140	There you go.
1723140	1727580	Get used to being beat down and yeah.
1727580	1728980	Yeah.
1728980	1734420	If you think I mean wait until you have to deal with a bank and a job anyway.
1734420	1741240	SSG100 Matt says if you drop incense and stay home you can get 200 Pokemon fine.
1741240	1742240	That is true.
1742240	1749020	Pokemon Go did roll back the excuse me roll front the the COVID-19 restrictions they had
1749020	1751200	previously removed from the game.
1751200	1752200	Those are back.
1752200	1753200	So that's good.
1753200	1757180	Probably not a good take when a lot you know when we're having the largest spike ever in
1757180	1761740	the well no no they they they implement they remember how they took those things away.
1761740	1767140	They put them back like two days ago so I'm saying like they made that choice and everybody
1767140	1770880	started locking down even more and they're like oh yeah.
1770880	1775960	Are you saying the recent spike in COVID cases is Niantic's fault.
1775960	1778160	What I'm saying is it's Ingress's fault.
1778160	1784660	And sure I don't know what I'm saying is that you know perhaps you know they kind of got
1784660	1790360	a clue when you know California which I think is where their headquarters is locked down
1790360	1798080	and they're like oh maybe maybe perhaps we should you know bring all that stuff back.
1798080	1799080	Stay safe everybody.
1799080	1801260	It's it's crazy crazy out there right now.
1801260	1805920	So all right yeah if you are going to play Pokemon Go and stuff just make sure you're
1805920	1807820	doing it the right way.
1807820	1811260	I mean I went out and did community day over the weekend I guess I'm getting into my gaming
1811260	1812260	week but whatever.
1812260	1818140	I went out and did community day on Saturday and honestly I didn't run into anybody.
1818140	1823100	It was pretty empty at the Capitol and I imagine having a six hour window is nice with that.
1823100	1828160	My other understanding is that there was some type of political rally that turned into fist
1828160	1831740	fighting that had been broken up before I got there.
1831740	1835540	So maybe that helped clear the area of people because I was like wow nobody's around and
1835540	1836780	everything's fenced off.
1836780	1840380	This is really pleasant today.
1840380	1848480	So anyway let's see going to some comments from our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network
1848480	1853500	bonds 006 says going to Central Park with incense can also rake in 200 Pokemon.
1853500	1856040	The issue would be food restrooms and battery power.
1856040	1858780	Yeah just you know have your plan for 200 Pokemon.
1858780	1862200	I I think it's doable but you got to be dedicated.
1862200	1867680	But again I think you have to ask yourself the very hard question I've asked myself with
1867680	1874780	a lot of games recently which is why or do you need to be level 41 or 50 or whatever
1874780	1882340	it is only Sonic and chat says Pokemon Go still is an opening on my iOS 14 phone WTF.
1882340	1883340	I run the same.
1883340	1887240	I run the most current iOS like fourteen point one or two whatever they're out on right
1887240	1889420	now and it's it's fine.
1889420	1892220	So not sure if it's a log in issue what's going on.
1892220	1897660	Try uninstalling it and then reinstalling it the classic off and on again type of switch.
1897660	1900440	You'd be surprised I might sound like I'm talking down or so I'm really not.
1900440	1905700	It is a very obvious yet not so obvious fix sometimes.
1905700	1909620	So all right anyway.
1909620	1910620	Let's move on.
1910620	1911800	We're dipping into our gaming weeks.
1911800	1913360	So let's talk about our gaming weeks.
1913360	1914880	How was your gaming week.
1914880	1918820	Before we get to that actually I want to make sure I plug a certain something something
1918820	1926420	because today is very special because we just launched here at VOG Network a brand new merchandise
1926420	1928980	store that are that are that are.
1928980	1935000	So you know it's obviously I never am going to sit here and go you need to give us money.
1935000	1936380	No you don't.
1936380	1939980	But I'm always very thankful when people do decide to do the subscriptions and the bits
1939980	1940980	and all that good stuff.
1940980	1942620	It's very very nice.
1942620	1946220	And you know we do spend money on hosting the Web site.
1946220	1950940	There's a lot of like legal fees and things because VOG Network is an actual business.
1950940	1954220	Hopefully next year we can get into sponsoring conventions again to help get the word out
1954220	1956240	about our shows and so on and so on.
1956240	1960500	And for a long time you guys have been asking where can I get a VOG Network t-shirt please
1960500	1962240	let me buy a VOG Network t-shirt.
1962240	1967820	Well good news you can now buy a VOG Network t-shirt and you just can go over to VOG network
1967820	1973060	dot com slash shop is the right word I believe Bobby Black Wolf because I said the right
1973060	1977900	I said store earlier but I think Bobby is making both redirect.
1977900	1983160	He's Rob proofing the URL but VOG network dot com slash shop will take you to the brand
1983160	1984700	new merch store where you can.
1984700	1987800	I think what's in there right now there's a Bobby Black Wolf mug.
1987800	1991900	There are three different types of shirts in there and there is some face masks.
1991900	1993900	How appropriate for the season.
1993900	1995260	Unfortunately there was no black.
1995260	1996900	There were no black face mask.
1996980	1998980	They only offer the face masks in white.
1998980	2002860	But thankfully we do have a white version of the VOG logo or it's actually black.
2002860	2003860	You know what I'm saying.
2003860	2005760	So it works on a piece of the white stuff.
2005760	2010620	So and if you like the VOG logo say thank you to Dark Sakura because she made that like
2010620	2015700	what eight years ago at this point whenever this network started was eight years ago I
2015700	2016700	lost track.
2016700	2017700	I'm old.
2017700	2018700	Yeah something like that.
2018700	2019700	All right.
2019700	2024740	So VOG network dot com slash shop if you actually buy it during the show it will scroll along
2024740	2028980	the bottom and say Rob Roberts just bought a VOG network mask.
2028980	2031720	So I mean that may be incentive or decent.
2031720	2032820	You don't.
2032820	2033860	It's an optional part.
2033860	2036540	If you don't fill it out I don't think it shows anything.
2036540	2038040	So just a heads up on that.
2038040	2041700	So if you're like I don't want people to know what I'm buying then don't fill that part
2041700	2043580	out at the bottom and it won't scroll anything at all.
2043580	2045820	So but thank you of course for your support.
2045820	2046820	Really appreciate it.
2046820	2052180	I'm not going to pimp that all the time or every week but we are going to look at trying
2052180	2055300	to add stuff to it as well.
2055300	2058740	Perhaps you'd like an O.L.R. or an Orange Lounge radio specific piece of merch.
2058740	2062020	We're working on it is soon.
2062020	2063020	Trademark.
2063020	2064020	All right.
2064020	2067060	Anyhow let's get into our gaming weeks now because I just want to make sure I got that
2067060	2070380	announcement out VOG network dot com slash shop Dark Sakura.
2070380	2073300	How was your gaming week.
2073300	2074300	It was.
2074300	2076700	There is there's some pinball.
2076700	2080220	We moved a lot of stuff around.
2080260	2086900	I played Animal Crossing of course because I'm not going to not play Animal Crossing.
2086900	2095300	But but yeah I mean honestly I think all of my energy was on like Supernatural finale.
2095300	2099340	And so that was sort of my focus.
2099340	2103380	It's a shame there was never a video game you know.
2103380	2110900	Oh well I'm surprised there was no there was there was tabletop R.P. but you know like
2110900	2114500	card games there's Supernatural clue which I kind of want.
2114500	2115500	Oh that's good.
2115500	2120060	And Trivial Pursuits and Monopoly because they did freakin versions of everything from
2120060	2121060	Monopoly.
2121060	2129460	But but yeah not not really so much just a lot of the Animal Crossing and word and wordscapes.
2129460	2133460	That's my other jam.
2133460	2134460	All right.
2134460	2138020	If that's it for Dark Sakura we'll move to Loki and your gaming week.
2138020	2141420	I didn't play a whole lot this week because I've been just mainly working on my stuff.
2141420	2148620	I did try to play a little bit of Minecraft but the problem is that Mojang updated bedrock
2148620	2156540	this week to some new version that's was have some parity with the Java version and their
2156540	2158220	servers are having trouble.
2158220	2162260	Oh I guess it's not necessarily that update as well but they also added realms to the
2162260	2165060	PlayStation users.
2165060	2168260	So now that they can access that as well and servers.
2168260	2174620	And so that's causing all sorts of problems being able to connect to our realm and stuff.
2174620	2178860	So that kind of sucked because my kids wanted to play with me and I couldn't.
2178860	2184920	So I did play a little bit though and that was all right but couldn't play in my realm
2184920	2185920	and that's disappointing.
2185920	2189960	But I worked a lot on my game and that's still coming along.
2189960	2195180	I know I keep seeing your little updates on Twitter and I'm so I really want to see it.
2195180	2196180	I'm so excited.
2196180	2197180	It's going to be the best holiday present.
2197180	2198180	I really want to show it to you.
2198180	2199180	All right.
2199180	2200180	Well get finish it up.
2200180	2201180	All right.
2201180	2207000	My gaming week continued adventures on my Xbox Series X that I talked about last week.
2207000	2210080	I actually did a stream on my personal channel earlier this week.
2210080	2213840	Cheap plug over at Rob Roberts also here on Twitch.
2213840	2218960	The video on demand is still there and I don't lock my video on demand so you can go
2218960	2219960	watch it if you want.
2219960	2224980	But I did a pretty thorough playthrough of well not complete playthrough but I was explaining
2224980	2227740	and narrating my choices in No Man's Sky.
2227740	2232600	So I was playing that for a good probably two hours on my feed earlier this week on
2232600	2233660	Xbox Series X.
2233660	2240840	I got to say I tried to stream originally from the Xbox and I guess the one negative
2240840	2246360	I'm going to say about the Xbox right now is that trying to stream from it on Twitch
2246360	2247360	sucks.
2247360	2252960	I'm sorry it's not good compared to how it was on Sony because you have to do it through
2252960	2260240	the Twitch app and you have no way to test the audio and you have no way to test the
2260240	2262720	video without going live.
2262720	2265040	I'm a perfectionist and I hate that.
2265040	2270320	So I hit the button to go live to broadcast from my Xbox and my camera looked like shit
2270320	2274120	in the living room and I couldn't hear myself even though I had a headset plugged into
2274120	2275120	my controller.
2275120	2277280	So I was like alright this is a terrible idea.
2277280	2281240	Do you just hook the camera to the Xbox how does that work?
2281240	2284080	It will use any USB camera.
2284080	2288160	So it's that I guess that is a plus over PlayStation is that you can use any USB camera.
2288160	2293280	I actually used this same camera that we use for Orange Lounge Radio is on a little tripod
2293280	2298240	so I moved it into the living room and yeah but my light you guys know my living room
2298240	2300040	the lighting in there is terrible.
2300040	2303240	So it wasn't good on the stream.
2303240	2307960	So I did like two seconds of that I was like forget it I'm going to move the Xbox into
2307960	2314120	my office and honestly that was really easy because one thing I love about the Xbox it's
2314120	2315120	a box.
2315120	2320080	It's very it's a decently sized console but it's very easy to pick up and move.
2320080	2323080	There's no power brick or anything.
2323080	2326600	I already had an HDMI cable hooked up in my office.
2326600	2329280	I just had to unplug the Wii U from it.
2329520	2330880	Rest in peace.
2330880	2335240	But then I just I put the box plugged it in where the Wii U was put in the we use HDMI
2335240	2340800	cable and I was able to stream the Xbox in my office on my PC.
2340800	2342080	Very easy.
2342080	2345000	And so yeah that's that's how I'll do it in the future.
2345000	2346000	Yeah.
2346000	2348880	S.G.O. 100 Matt says the alternative is to just put it into a capture card and do it
2348880	2349880	through OBS.
2349880	2351960	Yes that is what I did.
2351960	2355640	Yeah that's probably what I'm going to start doing because I wanted I've been wanting to
2355640	2361640	because I've been watching some people actually speed run the console Minecraft doing random
2361640	2366160	seeds and it looks like it's a pretty casual thing you can do.
2366160	2369800	So I kind of want to get into it because there's not a lot of competition on the console version
2369800	2370800	of it.
2370800	2374160	Whereas I normally play on the PC console version of it if you will.
2374160	2377800	But I can play on the console console version of it on my Xbox right here.
2377800	2379320	So makes sense.
2379320	2380320	Yeah.
2380320	2382920	So that made it really easy to stream.
2382920	2388440	So I'll do that again for sure because it's it's interesting because at least two people
2388440	2392200	one of them being Bobby Black Wolf has said you know after you kind of played that on
2392200	2396360	your stream it made me want to go check out all this stuff that I realized they'd added
2396360	2397360	to the game.
2397360	2398760	So I take that as a compliment.
2398760	2399760	Thank you.
2399760	2403760	Although Bobby found out the PlayStation 5 version of No Man's Sky has some issues right
2403760	2406560	now and it's all with the HDR.
2406560	2415680	The HDR effect is it's it's like turned up to 21 on a scale of 1 to 10 the HDR is 21
2415680	2418200	and so it looks really bad.
2418200	2421920	But if you turn the HDR off the game runs fluid fine.
2421920	2429240	I had I had no doubt that the game would run just as smoothly on PlayStation 5 as it does
2429240	2430560	on Xbox.
2430560	2435820	And to be fair the Microsoft version has some weird shit all of its own like the aliens
2435820	2440060	I mentioned lastly the aliens will sometimes hold things and that thing will move all over.
2440060	2445900	I have warped into a planet just to be dropped from six feet above.
2445900	2448620	Like I warped there's no ground.
2448620	2454180	So there's some weird bugs still but I'm sure Hello Games is aware and I know they're aware
2454180	2455780	of the HDR thing.
2455780	2458620	And so they'll they'll fix that all up in the coming weeks because they've been very
2458620	2460140	good at supporting their game.
2460140	2461440	So yeah No Man's Sky.
2461440	2468220	So on Xbox I played Ori and the Blind Forest not the new one will of the wisps because
2468220	2472480	in my head I'm like I can't play the new one until I beat the old one.
2472480	2476920	So I started the old one again and I always forget how the beginning of that video game
2476920	2483400	is like the beginning of the movie up like you're just it's it's a lot.
2483400	2487860	So just be emotionally ready that you're going to have some feels when you start playing
2487860	2488860	Ori and the Blind Forest.
2488860	2492020	Otherwise it's a beautiful game and this is the first time I've been able to play it
2492020	2494040	in 4K HDR.
2494040	2495040	It looks great.
2495040	2496040	Love it.
2496040	2497900	So there's that.
2497900	2503660	And yeah otherwise been continuing my adventures in Final Fantasy 14 of course and a little
2503660	2504660	bit of Hades too.
2504660	2505660	Just a little bit.
2505660	2506660	A little bit.
2506660	2507660	So that's my gaming week.
2507660	2508660	All right.
2508660	2513920	So with that I think we should get into some gaming news and see what's been happening
2513920	2514920	this week.
2514920	2518060	Loki, why don't you start us off with some gaming news.
2518060	2519060	Yes.
2519060	2522980	So I'm very excited that Cyberpunk is right around the corner.
2522980	2529300	They just put out a brand new gameplay trailer and it looks amazing.
2529300	2535780	So to kind of coincide with that they are recognizing that there's been a problem with
2535780	2540340	DMCA takedowns with copyright music on Twitch.
2540340	2547340	They've actually worked on creating a brand new mode for Cyberpunk that allows folks to
2547380	2553060	be able to disable certain copyrighted tracks basically saying if you're planning on live
2553060	2557580	streaming Cyberpunk or if you just want to make videos we want to introduce you to a
2557580	2561000	new mode that allow you to disable certain copyrighted tracks.
2561000	2565740	We know that for content creators licensed music can sometimes be problematic.
2565740	2570220	So with this new mode you'll be able to disable a small number of selected tracks which could
2570220	2576680	cause some issues replacing them with a different song helping to avoid any problems.
2576680	2577680	Thank you.
2577680	2581560	I know other games that do that but it is nice to see that they are recognizing that
2581560	2586160	in this day and age that it's probably a good thing to do.
2586160	2591640	So I'm looking forward to them trying that out when it does come out.
2591640	2595640	Yeah, I wonder if this is a new normal for games in a way.
2595640	2596780	It really should be.
2596780	2600860	We have seen it before, you're right, but obviously there's a lot of hype around this
2600860	2604400	game because the number of times it's been delayed and the fact that it's by the guys
2604400	2607700	who did The Witcher which is very well received.
2607700	2614240	So I'm glad they have this option in there and it makes me wonder if it's kind of setting
2614240	2622600	an example for other games to follow that maybe should consider putting in a DMCA proof
2622600	2625240	mode or whatever you want to call it in the game as well.
2625240	2629680	I don't know if they ever, I mean I would still be interested to see if it's gonna,
2629680	2633640	I mean I think they're doing their best guess on this right now with licensing because it's
2633640	2638960	all tricky with that type of stuff but hopefully that if it doesn't end up working out that
2638960	2642080	they can still patch out more stuff on it.
2642080	2645840	I just don't like, at least the effort is nice.
2645840	2647360	Yeah.
2647360	2650980	Speaking of like Twitch antics, I'm gonna kind of sidebar a little bit here because
2650980	2653160	Bobby was talking about this in depth on his show.
2653160	2654600	He even got a call on it.
2654600	2659920	Somehow it wasn't even on our list tonight but it's close to this story and it has to
2659920	2664120	do with the new Hyrule Warriors that came out, the Age of Calamity, which I know I have
2664120	2666840	a lot of friends on Twitch who have been streaming that and playing that.
2666840	2668360	Yeah, my son has it.
2668360	2669360	Oh really?
2669360	2670360	How's your son like it?
2670360	2671840	You didn't bring it up during your gaming week.
2671840	2673560	Well I guess it's your kid's gaming week but.
2673560	2675520	I'm not playing it yet.
2675520	2679520	He's very excited about it because he played through the demo like constantly, he played
2679520	2681160	a ton of the demo.
2681160	2685920	Thankfully what's kind of nice about it though is because he played the demo, it saved his
2685920	2691280	progress and he was able to continue just after the demo and plus it also gave him some
2691280	2695160	starter sword or something like that for playing the demo as like a bonus which is pretty cool
2695160	2697520	but he's really enjoying it.
2697520	2700480	Real quick, sorry, this is another great new trend in the games too.
2700480	2705720	The Dragon Quest XI Definitive Edition demo on Xbox, same thing.
2705720	2710040	If you play and it's like a 10 hour demo and the save file will transfer over to the full
2710040	2712960	game when it comes out so just on it.
2712960	2715080	I like that trend too.
2715120	2718160	Because he was worried that he'd have to restart his progress and I'm like well you know it's
2718160	2722720	a demo you know sometimes you have to do that but I asked him after he played it because
2722720	2727040	he said oh yeah I'm at Death Valley and I've already done all this stuff and he's talking
2727040	2730320	about it and I'm like oh so you didn't have to restart?
2730320	2735760	He's like no no no it let me continue from where I was and so yeah he's really enjoying
2735760	2736760	it.
2736760	2742760	He's like huge into the Breath of the Wild lore and everything now which is kind of crazy.
2742800	2748360	He plays a ton of Breath of the Wild and now he's been playing a ton of this so it's pretty
2748360	2749360	cool.
2749360	2753320	Boy I keep forgetting your kid is getting older and older and to the point where like
2753320	2756520	he's getting to be like a young man with his own taste.
2756520	2759160	Oh my god this is your youngest son wow.
2759160	2761760	He's getting older too.
2761760	2767680	Yeah my 10 year old son he's playing mostly Roblox still and a little bit of Among Us
2767880	2775440	but it's mostly my youngest son is playing the Hyrule Warriors and the Legend of Zelda
2775440	2778960	stuff he's really into Breath of the Wild.
2778960	2785680	So anyway the reason why I brought up Hyrule Warriors Tangent Train is because some folks
2785680	2790960	in Australia were streaming it right when the game came out in Australia and they ended
2790960	2796840	up getting DMCA'd by Nintendo because they were playing the game before release but it
2796880	2802680	wasn't before release in Australia it's just that Nintendo of America was America centric
2802680	2808560	and probably you know set the clock on their legal eagles to be midnight or 9pm pacific
2808560	2813800	whatever and Australia is what like 18 hours ahead or something so long story short these
2813800	2819040	guys in Australia got shut down for breaking DMCA when they when they really weren't doing
2819040	2821000	anything wrong.
2821000	2826040	It's kind of fucked up I mean but at the same time it it's a tough lesson in we are all
2826080	2829480	at video game companies mercies on the streaming thing right now.
2829480	2836040	It is and it's this is not new I mean there's been times where and this this is a little
2836040	2840320	bit more egregious though because there's been times where a copy will leak out and
2840320	2845520	then they will play it like several days before it comes out and then they'll DMCA them because
2845520	2852520	of that but this is released in your own region I mean that's that's a bit ridiculous.
2852520	2858640	Yeah I it's it's rough and I hope Nintendo would work with Twitch to restore these Australian
2858640	2860760	people who are really doing nothing wrong.
2860760	2867100	Was it Nintendo or Tecmo Koei because you know they're the ones that developed the game.
2867100	2872520	I believe all the stories were saying Nintendo but I didn't didn't Nintendo publish it even
2872520	2873520	if Tecmo Koei made it?
2873520	2876040	I think Nintendo still published it.
2876040	2882000	Yeah Bobby's confirming it was Nintendo that did it so so anyway you know but tough lesson
2882000	2887520	for our friends in Australia is that shouldn't even be a lesson there's no lesson to learn
2887520	2891320	you what you bought the game you're playing it on release well understand why they even
2891320	2895500	got struck down I get what you're saying Loki and you're right maybe that's not the best
2895500	2900300	word choice on my part but I still am going to err on the side of we are all on borrowed
2900300	2905860	time with this video game streaming thing anyway as it is so Nintendo is gracious enough
2905860	2910000	to let us you know stream the game and unfortunately they you know had the clock too early on the
2910000	2916080	Australia thing but Twitch is on American soil and Nintendo of America is on American
2916080	2921080	soil so by broadcasting through Twitch they kind of were held to the American rules and
2921080	2926120	it's something to think about I get and Loki it's not that I disagree with you it's one
2926120	2931860	of those like it sucks but it's the way it is and there ain't a lot we can do about it
2931860	2936240	they make it too difficult to broadcast their games then people aren't gonna broadcast their
2936240	2940960	games the broadcast other games I mean that's just kind of the way it is I mean they took
2940960	2946200	this hard stance before with like having everybody sign up for their Nintendo partner program
2946200	2951320	so that they can stream games or put stuff on YouTube so they could share in the revenue
2951320	2955400	I mean I was I'm sorry I had to wait it's scrolling along the bottom right now because
2955400	2959200	we have headlines that scroll throughout the show from various gaming websites someone's
2959200	2964200	already playing cyberpunk 2077 on Twitter that's a whole different thing that's obviously
2964200	2970240	someone has a review copy or there's they have I would assume it's a review copy this
2970240	2975180	early they wouldn't be shipping yet so they have a review copy that they're probably playing
2975180	2980600	and that's a big no-no and they will get caught I would assume act-def does want to point
2980600	2984540	out and it is always important if we get facts and stories have changed we need to report
2984540	2990080	those so act-def in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says they have been restored and
2990080	2995460	Bobby is saying reviewers don't have their copies yet you know because we're in a position
2995460	2998920	on Twitter and stuff and just having networked with enough people at e3 over the years and
2998920	3003980	stuff we we sometimes know when that stuff is out there and cyberpunk is not out there
3003980	3009260	yet but you know what is out there are the warehouses starting to store the disk because
3009260	3014340	you know it's a process to get the yes well I mean maybe I don't know just from the distribution
3014340	3019480	side it's usually more last minute but maybe these larger retailers are I would think it's
3019480	3027340	a bit early normally product doesn't arrive that much that early ah but they delayed the
3027340	3032100	game for a day one patch and they did it really late in the game so what do you want to bet
3032100	3037620	a lot of stuff was still moving for the old release date no I don't I don't buy it because
3037620	3042660	even if that was the case I mean that was still several weeks before it would launch
3042660	3050280	it's not to say that that hasn't happened I mean like for example there was I'm only
3050280	3054240	not pushing back because you've worked in distribution so I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm just
3054240	3058200	saying like if it were like an issue where like they have the recall something they would
3058200	3062560	recall it back it wouldn't be just sitting in a warehouse for months because they would
3062560	3067120	be tagged with the wrong release date anyways you'd see you know do not open until like
3067120	3071580	November 10th or something I don't remember the original release date thing is in November
3071580	3077860	I don't know whatever someone has it someone's playing it I'm sure they're not happy about
3077860	3081060	it but at least they're not striking their videos down as far as I'm aware they're more
3081060	3086380	like saying just be aware you know this is out there so well it is nice though it is
3086380	3090560	nice so that active mentioned in chat they have been restored so I'm glad they were able
3090560	3097100	to work it out you know the Nintendo and Australia and all that stuff but it it wasn't a great
3097100	3100660	thing that happened but maybe it's something for Nintendo to think about in the future
3100660	3103960	that maybe they should set that clock you know if the game releases what would be the
3103960	3107960	first country in the world to get video games New Zealand if that would or there's there's
3107960	3115480	an island the is Vanuatu or something but none of those none of those small islands
3115480	3120360	are technically game region releases they kind of usually I think a place like that
3120360	3124940	kind of shares with New Zealand and Australia so let's assume New Zealand is the first country
3124940	3130120	in the world that they get stuff then the clock has to be set to their time basically
3130120	3137120	so anyway all right uh Phoenix 7726 says I mean it's CD Projekt Red if it did get out
3137120	3141580	and it was ready to ship out they might not care much might have figured that it was inevitable
3141580	3145700	it would probably also depend on what was being shown my understanding is the person
3145700	3150120	who has Cyberpunk was showing the beginning of the game which CD Projekt Red's kind of
3150120	3157380	shown a million times already anyway if that person was out there streaming the ending
3157380	3160380	well my understanding is there's supposed to be a variety of endings so maybe it won't
3160380	3165300	be the most but I be careful when you start to stream stuff deep into the game especially
3165300	3169780	if there's big spoilers that's the stuff I would be very careful with I'm not up and
3169780	3174340	up on the story behind Cyberpunk so I don't know if there's like if there could be deaf
3174340	3178980	characters and stuff that could really spoil it for some people I don't know but I wouldn't
3179000	3182440	I'd be very careful in streaming any of that stuff because that's the stuff they're going
3182440	3189820	to want to keep a lid on for sure all right Bobby says apparently the prologue is six
3189820	3194720	hours long six hours before you get to the title card if you thought Persona or Kingdom
3194720	3199800	Hearts 2 had a long prologue how's that compared to Yakuza like a dragon which by the way I
3199800	3203480	watched some other people talk about that game and it has to be a little bit more interested
3203480	3209820	actually play because they say it is is very much like an RPG like a turn-based RPG it
3209820	3217340	just it's it is very slow to get started but man I've been playing that for several hours
3217340	3224100	and I'm still not past the tutorial section of the game wow all right well let's move
3224100	3230180	on I want to talk about another big game that's recent and that is Doom Eternal you know came
3230200	3236960	out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox one and you know it has it's now on game pass so if you want to
3236960	3241840	play it on your Series X you can do that it's on PC of course the platform that's missing thus
3241840	3248120	far is the Nintendo switch and you might remember the I want to say original doom but the original
3248120	3254480	doom reboot from a few years ago that did come out on Nintendo switch and it was received pretty
3254540	3260360	well so folks on Nintendo switch some of them were really looking forward to Doom Eternal well
3260360	3264700	I shouldn't say past tense so here's the thing it is still coming but there was a little bit of
3264700	3270700	confusion because apparently GameStop reached out to some folks who pre-ordered Doom Eternal
3270700	3276920	on switch and said the game is canceled so this caused people to go what oh is this because
3276920	3283040	Microsoft bought Bethesda so now they're canceling the switch release how could this happen well
3283100	3289180	here's what's happened so the Bethesda support account on Twitter chimed in we have not made
3289180	3294820	any announcements on doom eternal being canceled for switch keep an eye on our website and official
3294820	3300140	Twitter channels for more information well here's the statement from Bethesda while doom eternal is
3300140	3306500	a hundred percent on track for an imminent digital only release on Nintendo switch the absence of a
3306500	3312140	physical release at retail resulted in canceled pre-orders affected customers will receive full
3312160	3317540	refunds and should contact their preferred retailer for more information so the physical
3317540	3324000	version of doom eternal was canceled but it will still release in digital form only which you know
3324000	3330140	I may be a problem if you're a collector if you're you know for a lot of people are buying digital
3330140	3335960	anyway so it's not really a problem what's to blame we don't know was the demand there we don't
3335960	3340720	know is that the pandemic and supply shortages and being able to make the game we don't know
3340740	3345900	the reasons we just know it's not going to be happening physically anymore um let me ask you
3345900	3351460	guys though if this was a game you were really interested in and they suddenly canned the
3351460	3357340	physical release in favor of a digital only one would this make you not want to buy it or would
3357340	3361980	you just kind of shrug your shoulders and be like hey all right well at least I'll still play the
3361980	3368420	game I mean on the switch probably not a big deal I get most of my games digitally anyways I except
3368560	3374600	last high rewards I did pick up physically because I have so many games installed to my memory card
3374600	3382120	that like I'm running out of space so I just figured I'd grab this one physically but you
3382120	3388320	know it's no big deal I don't really if at this point it doesn't matter yeah I think there's so
3388320	3393500	much that's digital only anyway it's not a huge deal like just a couple weeks ago or last week
3393500	3397160	actually we were talking about fuser Shane was on the show talking about how much he loved to
3397160	3402140	harmonics his new fuser and I remember when I was like oh that's like a download only thing right
3402140	3407140	so how much is it like 20 bucks he's like no it's $60 it's full price game I'm like what but that's
3407140	3412400	where some things are going now is that you know and to be fair if I were to buy it on Steam or a
3412400	3421500	lot I'd be paying full price for it there too so it's kind of kind of interesting anyway one of the
3421500	3427140	thing I want to say though on the Bethesda and Xbox issue before we go to our next story is that
3427140	3434960	the folks at Microsoft have clarified this is coming from Tim Stewart who's the chief financial
3434960	3441280	officer over Xbox said quote what we'll do in the long run is we don't have intentions of just
3441280	3448240	pulling all of Bethesda content out of Sony or Nintendo or otherwise but what we want is but we
3448240	3454940	want is we want that content in the long run to be either first or better or best or you pick your
3454940	3461940	differentiated experience on our platforms we will want Bethesda content to show up the best as on
3461940	3466820	our platforms that's not a point about being exclusive that's not a point about we're being
3466820	3472300	adjusting timing content or roadmap but if you think something like game pass if it shows up
3472300	3476820	best in game pass that's what we want to see and we want to drive our game pass subscriber base
3476880	3481800	through that Bethesda pipeline so a couple interesting things about it no they're not
3481800	3487380	gonna pull out of Sony and switch but they do fully intend on making the best version on Xbox
3487380	3493040	that's for sure I mean as it makes sense of course that should be obvious to literally anybody the
3493040	3499440	other interesting thing about that comment nowhere in it did Tim Stewart the chief financial officer
3499440	3510340	say the word Xbox the word he said was game pass hmm just an interesting observation there's been a
3510340	3515820	lot of talk about what is Microsoft's plan in this whole thing does Microsoft care about how many
3515820	3522340	Xboxes they sell because that answer says that's not what they're looking at mr. chief financial
3522340	3529720	officer just don't make money off consoles it's just it's just an interesting confirmation of
3529720	3535000	something I think we all I mean a backhanded confirmation fine it's not really a confirmation
3535000	3542000	but it is for me of something we've all been kind of speculating about anyway as to what is Microsoft
3542000	3548320	really in this to do right now that was the most interesting part of the quote for me the rest of
3548320	3557540	it was obvious anyway Zen monkey 11 in our chat says buying Skyrim digital on ps4 before it's
3557540	3562980	pulled from PlayStation 4 store I actually don't think that'll happen Zen monkey what what is
3562980	3569620	Microsoft have to gain from that especially a game as old and dusty at this point as Skyrim I'm
3569620	3573760	making it sound terrible it's really not I just played Skyrim last week okay it's still gorgeous
3573980	3579260	all these years later Alan is playing it again right now with all the new mods so Skyrim is in
3579260	3585220	some ways a timeless game what does Microsoft have to gain pulling it from PlayStation when so many
3585220	3591860	people already have that game on PlayStation like I just would Don Mattrick have pulled it from
3591860	3598220	PlayStation probably is Phil Spencer gonna do it nah and I think a lot of these other comments we've
3598240	3604800	seen coming from Microsoft they they're not they're not thinking about we've got to have
3604800	3614540	Xbox be the only platform it's game pass so when Sony puts out that competitor to game pass we'll
3614540	3618760	talk about that later in the show when Sony inevitably puts out that competitor game pass
3618760	3623840	beyond what they're already doing a PlayStation Plus that my friend is where you will never see
3623840	3631700	Skyrim you will never see doom you will never see starfield or any Bethesda product on PlayStation
3631700	3637860	game pass Sony is gonna have to get in bed with some other companies I mean but granted they've
3637860	3642140	got a pretty strong first party lineup as it is you can't you know I think they do pretty well
3642140	3649580	with what they got but Sony will have to get in bed with other third parties to get on their game
3649580	3658040	pass Phoenix 7726 says on one hand Microsoft is not EA so Bethesda will probably not die on the
3658040	3663120	other hand consolidation ain't good in this market I think it's really early to be thinking
3663120	3667600	about consolidation and those types of things too especially in this nature of this pandemic world
3667600	3673040	we're living in and like like a lot of companies are having a hard time putting out games right
3673040	3681700	now fuck look at Microsoft themselves halo got halo should in any other year like needed to be
3681700	3700100	out now but it got delayed to 2021 it's it's different now we have to be thinking of this
3700100	3705280	industry different now than we were thinking about it in 2012 or whenever the last round of
3705280	3710560	consoles will I can't I can't get my ears fucking straight anyway nothing about me straight I can't
3710560	3716060	get the years together anymore but I think it was 2012 but the way we're approaching things
3716060	3724320	it's different now it is so different all right anyway let's move on dark Sakura but then but but
3724320	3731940	then there's Nintendo right so and this is this is something that's already happened a couple of
3731940	3742120	days ago as of now but on the 19th there was the update for Animal Crossing new horizons we got
3742120	3751260	some maple leaves that are floating down that you can catch like getting the cherry blossoms and we
3751260	3759660	had all the holiday events and some toys and new stuff that you can get crafting and you also had
3759660	3769140	the introduction of turkey day which is the 26th and toy day on December 24th with that creepy ass
3769140	3777060	reindeer jingle with his creepy ass eyes and so turkey day is fun you have to collect ingredients
3777580	3783380	to make dishes so everyone can have turkey day where they you know apparently eat his kindred
3783380	3792980	and then of course toy day is you know you you'll get all the snow and decorated trees and ornaments
3792980	3802220	and crafting and stuff like that they have also put in new hairstyles and reactions which I have
3802220	3807300	yet to redeem I probably should do that but the thing that's really good about the hairstyles is
3807300	3818180	that it's bringing in more hairstyles that are I'd say typically associated with with the black
3818180	3823620	community so there's like you know puffs and cornrows and and natural hair and everything
3823620	3830900	which I think is wonderful because it's representation there's also a home storage limit
3830940	3841420	upgrade so basically if you have paid off your final loan in full then you can get your your
3841420	3849020	storage expanded to 2,400 slots which I needed I had a very full storage Sia Tabiri in our chat
3849020	3854780	room is clearly more excited about this than anything else saying in all caps more home storage
3854780	3860300	I no longer need to sell something every time I see a cute thing at the Able Sisters that pretty
3860340	3867380	much I've been just trying to keep like the the non-orderable items in my inventory but yeah I
3867380	3874980	don't keep many many pants I have because I mean basically my character dresses like I do it's Dean
3874980	3883660	flannel and you know t-shirts and shit so but anyway you can also now visit random islands in
3883660	3890060	your dreams so instead of having to have a dream address you can just go wherever there is a
3890060	3897460	collaboration with Animal Crossing pocket camp you can get a pocket camp smartphone you can and
3897460	3907180	this is the big thing for this one is that you can do data transfers so if it allows you to you
3907180	3913140	to transfer your resident data to another system including your name appearance equipment along
3913140	3918780	with your inventory your storage and your home there's a whole separate transfer feature that
3918780	3926620	will let you do the save data and the island itself in the residence to another system but
3926620	3932660	no they couldn't change the fact that if I don't want my youngest son to be in charge of my island
3932660	3941740	I can't change who is actually in charge of my island feedback but anyway there's also more new
3941780	3947740	seasonal items that are gonna start on December 1st at nook stop and different festive items to
3947740	3956060	decorate between the 26th and 31st of December so fun stuff I've been enjoying it when I have
3956060	3962540	actually had energy to play getting lots and lots of leaves I think I've already made half of the
3962540	3968380	fall crafting already it's been pretty cool very cute Jamie I have something to confess I don't
3968660	3973060	say it in a while I haven't played in a while I don't think I've touched my island since Labor
3973060	3981300	Day does ketchup hate me now she's probably crying and things that you haven't come to see here but
3981300	3991660	you can repair your relationship with ketchup actually do me a favor when you play let me come
3991660	4000020	over and catch a roach oh I think you can catch a roach no shoot only you can do it crap I don't
4000020	4003020	know if they actually do that in the game because I didn't see anything in the inventory but remember
4003020	4006620	the old game if you didn't play for a while you could go into your house and catch bugs
4006620	4010980	interesting but I don't think you can do that because you can't actually use the bug net inside
4010980	4018100	of the building now yeah yeah huh yeah I don't think you can all right so no no roach catching
4018100	4026380	for you all right let's move on to our next story Loki so this is pretty cool so apparently
4026380	4033980	Iowa interactive they have revealed that they're beginning work on a brand new project project 007
4033980	4042500	of course IO interactive best known for the hitman series I mean that that could only be good so
4042500	4050540	apparently they are you know creating an original bond game they said it's an monumental undertaking
4050540	4057180	and they believe that IO interactive working closely with their partners at UN and MGM are
4057180	4064220	gonna be able to deliver an amazing game so that's all we know with you know that right now but I
4064460	4074260	mean it sounds like a good combination yeah I was thinking recently too I think it was because of
4074260	4079180	Sean Connery's passing I was kind of thinking like oh it's been a while since we've had like a real
4079180	4084420	like kick-butt James Bond game I know they you know obviously GoldenEye is gonna be that standard
4084420	4090060	that every other game I reloaded in yeah unfortunately lightning didn't strike twice there
4090060	4095020	but didn't they I haven't didn't yay or some other company made a couple games I thought
4095020	4098980	wouldn't there like a I don't even think it was Skyfall but I feel like there was like a game
4098980	4107940	around that time that was like a separate like story all to its own they're like a unique story
4107940	4114500	I thought I don't I could be wrong I might be confusing it with that old get older game on
4114500	4126500	PlayStation 2 but um well they have like there was let's see I'm trying to think I know they
4126500	4131380	have that legends game they have like kind of a whole bunch of different oh maybe that's what
4131380	4136660	was thinking on there yeah yeah yeah I don't know I don't think that was like necessarily a you know
4136660	4144820	unique thing Bloodstone but I don't know if that I don't think that's based on the movie
4144820	4152580	no that's not a movie title so huh well anyway I I think it'll be interesting to see the hitman
4152580	4159300	team and what they do a James Bond it'll be it'll be interesting Zen Monkey 11 in chat says
4159300	4167660	Goldeneye Source is the best to date so all right yeah right I mean the bad things more of a fan
4167660	4174100	project that's certainly not Activision's Goldeneye Reloaded which is not of that caliber
4174100	4179660	or quality yes I feel like we just had a story on Goldeneye Source a couple weeks ago so all right
4179660	4186300	well let's move on and talk about maybe this James Bond game will be so good it gets nominated at the
4186340	4191620	game awards in a couple years we did get the award list or excuse me the nominee list for the game
4191620	4197460	awards 2020 which obviously is going to be a bit of a virtual event they are going to be using
4197460	4204100	three sound stages in Los Angeles London and Tokyo especially since people still can't travel right
4204100	4209380	now makes a lot of sense you can't get all those Japanese developers to LA so they're gonna have to
4209380	4213340	do something in Tokyo but of course obviously you know they're gonna still be taking COVID
4213340	4217460	precautions so I don't know how they're gonna do it watching some of these other award shows that
4217460	4220940	have taken place have been kind of interesting they are seeing it's only gonna be minimal
4220940	4227580	attendees mainly production crew and presenters so no no like audience obviously I mean we we
4227580	4233420	know that's not gonna happen but Jeff Keeley has talked about how it is gonna allow additional
4233420	4239040	presentation events similar to past shows but it's also exploring taking the game awards to
4239040	4245960	different venues in the future anyway as it was previously there's gonna be 45 different platforms
4245960	4250240	you can watch the game awards on so they're still trying to keep up the number of viewers for this
4250240	4258080	and we have the nominees so obviously I could read every category but there's a lot if you want to
4258080	4262880	check them out and you want to vote on the winners you can do that over on the official game awards
4262880	4272240	website but by the way viewer votes only count for 10% of the total vote 90% is the jury which
4272240	4277360	is you know a lot of industry people so food for thought your vote doesn't matter that much all
4277360	4283400	right moving on to game of the year nominees this is the one everybody talks about so the nominees
4283400	4291080	for game of the year are but animal crossing new horizons an entry that I think is surprising and
4291080	4296680	non-surprising being that it's 2020 and this is a game you know we've talked about it at length on
4296680	4302320	this show thanks dark soccer but all of us really have been obsessed with animal crossing is as a
4302320	4307400	way to deal with the pandemic so not surprised to see it here in the list for game of the year
4307400	4313640	there's always one Nintendo game in there doom eternal is also nominated for game of the year
4313640	4320240	which we brought up earlier the Final Fantasy 7 remake is nominated for game of the year ghosts
4320240	4328120	of Tsushima is nominated for game of the year Hades is up for game of the year and the last of
4328120	4335840	us part two is the final nominee for game of the year so some games that are not on the list cyber
4335840	4341640	punk 2077 but that's because they delayed it past the eligibility timeframe we talked about that
4341640	4345880	during the last delay now that it comes out in December it missed the delay window for this so
4346040	4351040	that's why cyberpunk is not nominated some other games that didn't get nominated for game of the
4351040	4355440	year Ori and the will of the Wisps got nominated in some other categories but some folks were
4355440	4361160	thinking it was a shoe-in for game of the year nominee half-life Alex despite everything it did
4361160	4365400	for VR did get some other awards and some technical categories like best game direction best audio
4365400	4372360	design was not nominated for game of the year some other categories that I do think are interesting
4373200	4381680	best mobile game among us is nominated among us came out in 2018 so it's interesting that it's
4381680	4386640	there it's kind of like the Grammys your best new artist the year people finally have heard of you
4386640	4393560	I guess let's see what else what was the other one I wanted to say the best ongoing game was
4393560	4399520	an interesting one as well no man's sky was I know yeah no man's sky is in that category which
4399520	4404800	you know I love that but it's got some tough competition apex legends I mean they've they've
4404800	4410240	gotten fortnight kind of in a similar vein destiny 2 is in that category and Call of Duty Warzone
4410240	4416760	also in that category so interesting interesting Bobby Black Wolf is wondering if among us released
4416760	4425040	for mobile this year that's a good question you might be right on that front that could be some
4425040	4430480	folks in chat putting their opinion out there act def says who do I think deserves to win ghosts
4430480	4435720	of Tsushima who do I think is going to win The Last of Us part 2 what game is gonna be pretty
4435720	4443240	cool if it won Animal Crossing for me I've only played half the games so it's not really fair for
4443240	4451040	me to like put my too much in this there is a big part of me that's rooting for Hades just the fact
4451120	4457040	that it is that little indie game that could in this year I have to admit like me personally
4457040	4460760	that's the one I want to see win based on everything I've heard around the internet
4460760	4463960	and buzz and stuff like that though I actually think ghosts of Tsushima has a really good shot
4463960	4470640	I kind I kind of think similar to how um Sekiro die or excuse me shadows die twice won last year
4470640	4477560	I kind of feel like ghosts of Tsushima is yes I know there's The Last of Us part 2 that's gonna
4477600	4482640	be tough but I don't know there's there was some tough competition last year too I just there's
4482640	4486560	something about the ghost of Tsushima that I think is gonna gonna be the tough one to beat so we'll
4486560	4492520	see any thoughts early on on this list I mean I know you guys are like me and probably haven't
4492520	4502000	played them all but haven't played most of them I mean they're all good choices yeah I don't see
4502000	4506920	a problem with any of those I know some people some people don't like Last of Us to being in
4506920	4519760	there but yeah well some people are wrong so Jamie I don't even think I have to ask which
4519760	4525400	one in that group you're rooting for but as much as you're an Animal Crossing fan I know you got
4525400	4529200	to be smiling that something like Hades got in there too it's always nice to see the indie folks
4529200	4542400	yes yes you do yes yeah I'm really happy I actually really enjoy the art style in it so so
4542400	4552160	yeah I hope so I mean I'd really love to see Last of Us to you know very cool all right well we'll
4552160	4558800	see the game awards themselves are taking place on December the 10th so you don't have that long
4558800	4562840	to wait that's the interesting thing about the game awards I feel like the nominees come out and
4562840	4566640	then it's like two weeks later is the award show like it's a very fast turnaround feel like it's
4566640	4571960	fast faster than the Oscars you want to talk about fast turnaround like there already was
4571960	4581120	that they're talking about doing a g4 special like what in a couple days yeah well it's already been
4581120	4586520	taped because one of my Twitter people made it no secret that they're in it and it's not somebody
4586640	4593040	that was involved in the old g4 so you know it's a they've apparently reached out to some big
4593040	4598840	streamers and folks like that which is not terribly surprising something Bobby picked up on which I
4598840	4603680	neglected when I first saw I neglected to notice it when I first saw it because I have to admit I
4603680	4610160	don't I don't idolize g4 television the way some of you do like I just I'm just putting it out
4610160	4619400	there like why focus on this one thing when there is so much other stuff out there in the media
4619400	4626520	world well okay and that's what I was gonna say is that Bobby had pointed out that like pretty
4626520	4638400	much all the pre tech TV stuff like none of it is represented none of it so it's uh it's this
4638400	4645600	is definitely memories of a certain era of g4 yeah Bobby Black Wolf says I don't idolize g4 I
4645600	4649440	just worked with them for two years that that wasn't a call-out for any specific person or
4649440	4655080	anything and yes I of course you have a long history I mean in a way we kind of do too right
4655080	4660240	because of you know the fact that we were affiliated with all games for those years so
4660720	4669480	but I just feel like now in the year 2020 like g4 televisions coming up to a very full Thanksgiving
4669480	4677280	table and I feel like some people are willing to to just do anything to be a part of the new
4677280	4686920	g4 TV and I'm just kind of like okay but like there's other like I I don't think g4 TV is the
4686960	4696880	top of the mountain in media the way that maybe it was back in the day when you know it was first
4696880	4702360	on TV I think that's more my kind of point there is that g4 is coming to a very crowded space now
4702360	4710880	and and trying to milk the nostalgia and all that stuff and yeah anyway so Bobby Black Wolf says g4
4710880	4716520	began with attack of the show and x-play according to the reunion Tiger class says it's g4 in name
4716520	4726240	only not the g4 you remember so it good luck you know I I won't be watching I've got other things
4726240	4736480	to do okay but but will cheaters and cops be at the table too moving on all right we were talking
4736480	4741240	about a fast turnaround on the game awards let's talk about things that are a slow turnaround
4741640	4751880	Bioware releases right Jamie yeah lady insanity on Twitter put out a link to her blog and she does
4751880	4760200	you know of course lots of stuff for Bioware so the their whole roadmap is out and she posted
4760200	4769200	it on her blog so just to give some highlights of this I'll just start off with with this month
4769280	4777240	with what's left of November and December then is it you know they they did the release for the
4777240	4783080	Bioware stories and secrets from 25 years of game development book it's very very cool has lots of
4783080	4790200	stuff about cancelled games and behind-the-scenes stuff and concept art you know and this was of
4790200	4796120	course after n7 day happened where they announced the Mass Effect Legendary Edition so on December
4796120	4804280	4th is Dragon Age Day but there may be something announced that day we don't know of course
4804280	4810600	December 10th is the Game Awards and there's a rumor that they may be doing another trailer for
4810600	4820280	the next Dragon Age and then Star Wars the Old Republic Echoes of Oblivion they will have new
4820280	4828520	content called Spirit of Vengeance and then going into 2021 a little bit more about the Art of Mass

4844120	4853400	moving a bit forward though April 2022 is when it's projected for the next Dragon Age to release
4853400	4861440	Wow and they're talking about anthem again I don't care about anthem just no it says anthem
4861440	4868200	has been an active redevelopment no I do need to try that now that it's on the EA play game
4868200	4874680	pass thing so it's like okay no no harm no foul no money needed to spend on it I'm curious and
4874680	4884280	of course also the last thing on there is again for 2022 to be determined is next Mass Effect so
4884280	4891720	we'll see no time soon on that I'm sure yeah oh no we'll still be we'll still be doing all our will
4891720	4897880	be like what 40 we'll have hit episode thousand by the time that game's out I'm sure episode
4898120	4902840	thousand that should be a party uh yeah I it really should be the pandemic should be over
4902840	4908440	by then because we're still looking to get to episode 1000 that's we're on 844 tonight that's
4908440	4913960	still gonna be a good at least three years out till we get to a thousand we need to do this
4914680	4923640	yeah are you guys committed um sure but it's a it's a I don't want to take on more than I can
4923640	4930120	chew just I think getting you're already doing it getting to a thousand episodes is gonna be
4930120	4934360	the show oh I thought you meant making it a big event I'm sorry I thought you meant make it okay
4934360	4940760	I misinterpret yes make it make it to a thousand and then we like okay we're done count my lucky
4940760	4945960	stars nothing happens to me of course I want us to be back in the same studio this is I mean
4945960	4952280	I'm glad this works but I miss the magic of all of us being in the same room it's not the same
4952280	4960440	to me so I'm glad we can still be here but yeah but you know there is an advantage what's that I
4960440	4968840	can sit at my desk and eat spaghetti there's a your throne has gone unsad in except by mr smoosh
4968840	4977560	for like nine months now well better dust it off yeah right oh and hey hey um I just took another
4977560	4983240	covid test if it's clean who knows who knows well let's let's get past this big spike that's
4983240	4989160	happening right now but yeah um let's see bobby blackwolf in chat says pull a travis donovan
4989160	4995640	make it to episode 999 and then rebrand and start at episode one yeah uh zen monkey says if you
4996600	5002200	if you make the show seven days a week you get two thousand easy yeah well I mean that's how like uh
5002200	5005720	you know gamertag radio they hit a thousand episodes because I remember talking about that
5005720	5010440	and that's they've done multiple episodes a week this is in no way knocking this incredible
5010440	5016200	achievement that they have it's just their show is different as different podcasts are so they got to
5016200	5022760	a thousand episodes by you know doing multiple episodes in a week which cool uh you know they
5022760	5027880	probably also have been going longer than supernatural has been on tv which is no small
5027880	5033960	feat you know what I mean so uh yeah any show that makes it to a thousand episodes is uh got
5033960	5038120	my respect but yeah when we're going when we're taking it a week at a time it's gonna take a
5038120	5044280	little while and not and to be fair we take off about six shows a year which is way better than
5044280	5053800	any show on tv um but you know holidays things happen travel dragon con or whatever con uh we
5053800	5062120	take off about six shows a year so I'm gonna think about all right uh what when we're done
5062120	5069800	we salt and burn the show we give it a viking funeral uh I was saying a hunter's funeral
5070600	5074920	uh bobby blackwolf and chat says you're gonna need to give us lots of bits and buy lots of
5074920	5080680	merch to do a vegas party oh who said it was gonna be in vegas you know where we're gonna
5080680	5090040	have you know where olr con's gonna be roseville golf land in the party room no all right that's
5090120	5098120	i'm kind of down we get the banquet room at brookfield's i'm down for that too honestly
5098120	5103800	get the banquet room at brookfield's yeah let's do it i love it hey they have my favorite soup
5105480	5111640	anyway uh let's see uh phoenix says i wonder if there's a podcast up to 10 000 episodes
5111640	5117480	yet um i'm sure somewhere there's there's daily shows out there right and not not necessarily
5117480	5123000	about video games but what's uh leo leport and his stuff at aren't they every day
5123800	5128440	he has so many different series like i used to follow a lot of that stuff but like he's got like
5129560	5135400	multiple shows a day coming out like it's just insane that's what happened with pod save america
5135400	5140840	i used to listen when it was like you know this little little new podcast that you know and now
5140840	5147080	it's like a fucking media empire so it's hard to follow they used to have their like daily show
5147080	5153160	they have a few daily shows and they have like an android show and an apple show and a windows show
5153160	5159160	and it's like there's just so many and this is okay sorry tangent but y'all brought it on
5159160	5163560	this is what this is why i can't get through a show like pod save america or any of that stuff
5163560	5168600	anymore oh my god i can't believe i named names i'm sorry guys i i i really respect everything
5168600	5174120	that's goes into a podcast and stuff but here's the thing about a lot of other networks that
5174120	5181320	really bother me you tune in to listen to the show and get your talk right and the entire intro of
5181320	5187160	the show is here's everything that's going on this week on all of the other shows you need to be
5187160	5193080	checking out for like to and then let's go to an ad about squarespace or whatever the ad of the
5193080	5197880	week thing is let's talk about me undies or whatever the fuck is sponsoring a podcast this
5197880	5203960	week right and then it's like by the time you actually get into the content that you tuned in
5203960	5210120	for you're like 15 minutes into the show and i'm saying that as somebody who plays a very active
5210120	5214840	role here at vog network i'm happy to tell you about all the new shows that come on board and
5214840	5219480	all that stuff but i am not going to spend 10 minutes at the top of every show going here's
5219480	5230440	why you should listen to something else it's just anyway am i alone in that okay clearly yes all
5230440	5237720	right uh zen monkey says wow podcast networks do that oh sorry sorry i like how they do the ads
5237720	5245000	for um like uh uh stuff you missed in history and stuff mom never told you the the ones that that
5245000	5250200	are there through i heart radio um even though it's corporate and you know they've got to have
5250200	5257480	the sponsors i think that they space out their sponsor in digestible little chunks that are
5257480	5262600	maybe no more than a minute a minute and a half and it doesn't really interrupt what you're
5262600	5268680	listening to that much yeah like you know um you sure commercial breaks like you're used to like
5268680	5272440	when you're when your things are that way yeah whatever like and honestly when i was listening
5272440	5277720	to the rue paul and michelle podcast which where the hell did that go they just they they stopped
5277720	5282920	right around the time that rue deleted twitter i don't know but anyway um and look i realize that
5282920	5290280	rue has a lot of issues twitter uh it might be back now but i at one point yeah rue like i think
5290920	5295880	rue was getting cancelled for something i don't know was it the fracking i don't know i something
5295880	5301720	was going on bruce twitter is up oh okay well at some point it was down and that show just vanished
5301720	5306680	but anyway like the way they did ads on that show almost became a parody like it was great
5307240	5313240	anyway like i there's nothing i love more than listening to trixie impersonate rue doing an ad
5313240	5320600	spot that's okay that actually sounds really funny but i mean but it is kind of a sad reality um for
5321240	5328680	like for for us we're able to swing a lot of what we do you know yeah but but for some people this
5328680	5334920	is exactly how they are able to keep doing what they do is by by sponsored funding i'm not i i
5334920	5339560	have no problem with sponsorships and commercials and things like that it's it's when it's over
5339560	5343880	done and it's the complete beginning of the show you know what i mean that's where it's an issue
5343880	5349720	i don't want it well it's like i mean even like for example for my for my blog i i do have like
5349720	5355480	a couple little revenue things but they go at the very end of my article and i think that that's
5355480	5361640	kind of how the sponsorship should be is that it should be in an innocuous place yeah all right
5361640	5371240	let's agree let's move on uh next story is uh loki's all right so uh we talked about how some
5371960	5378120	games are getting different enhancements as they move to these new generation of consoles so of
5378120	5383720	course uh with that we see some of these older games that were from the xbox one and playstation
5383720	5392520	4 also getting enhancements as well um however there are seeming to be more coming to the xbox
5392520	5399880	um series x and s because of the nature of how they're able to patch updates for their
5399880	5404440	backwards compatibility so for example later this year we're going to be getting an update
5404440	5410680	for rocket league that's going to allow it to run in 120 fps on the xbox series x and s
5411320	5417720	but they are not able to do that on the playstation 5 without building a full native port
5417720	5425640	of the game um because of the way like i said that that works on the playstation 5 versus
5426200	5433160	the xbox uh series of consoles also um along with that there's gonna be some updates coming
5433160	5440040	to star wars squadrons as well they're gonna allow the game to run at 1440p at 120 fps on the series
5440040	5451000	s and it looks like at 4k at 120 fps as well in the series x which would be incredible um
5451000	5457800	and then of course call of duty war zone is also going to be gaining 120 fps update on consoles as
5457800	5465880	well and um they're saying that also that there's it may end up being around 100 with some of the
5465880	5471720	slowdowns in there but um still need to see that some updates are coming but it kind of sucks i
5471720	5478120	guess with the differences in architecture that it is limiting sometimes with how they're able
5478120	5482440	to implement that and they can't necessarily do it equally across the board with two different
5482440	5492520	uh manufacturers of consoles yeah it's um it's i'm hearing it's it's a little more because bobby
5492520	5497800	was talking about this on his show see a natural network plug a little bit about the um no man's
5497800	5503240	sky on playstation 5 and how it seems to be a bit of a a chore to get the playstation 5 version on
5503240	5509560	there from the playstation 4 disc where you have to kind of like install the the playstation 4
5509560	5514520	version and then once that's there you can kind of choose to download the playstation 5 version
5514520	5518760	which will require the disc to be in your console to play it which makes it i mean i'm not mad about
5518760	5522440	that yeah that makes sense but it's weird that you have to like go through the playstation 4
5522440	5528680	version to get the playstation 5 version whereas i'm gonna be honest my microsoft experience was
5528680	5534120	okay no man skies in game pass download it to my xbox series series x it's obviously getting the
5534120	5539400	new version of the game whatever launch the game and oh it synced my slave file save file to the
5539400	5545160	crowd to the cloud so if i wanted to play my old save which i'd played for like 15 minutes on xbox
5545160	5549320	one i could have brought that in but i just started a new one but i thought it was it was
5549320	5554440	just right there ready to go yeah it seems like they're kind of treatment i mean obviously these
5554440	5559880	consoles are more like pcs every day but they're treating it more like a pc where if i own a game
5559880	5567160	on steam and i get a new pc i can download it but i can play it in you know with better resolution
5567160	5572200	with more graphic enhancements added to it at a higher frame rate and that's kind of how they're
5572200	5577240	treating it with that they're not making it so that i have to create a brand new version of the
5577240	5583160	game for this pc and a brand new version of the game for this pc and i think that's a good
5583160	5588280	approach that they took and hopefully sony will be a little bit more i i don't know if sony can
5588280	5593160	necessarily redesign their whole platform they probably can at this point but maybe adding some
5593160	5598840	more resolutions available because i know we were talking about it last week or so that they don't
5598840	5605080	have 1440p right now at launch they have to patch that in you know maybe adding some of those um
5605720	5611560	as you know different resolutions that they can use to hit some of these higher frame rates like
5611560	5615400	for example going back to rocket league they're saying that they have a performance mode on the
5615400	5624680	series x that plays at 2688 by 1512 resolution at 120 fps um but the playstation 5 version will
5624680	5629800	be limited 4k at 60 fps because i don't think they can do those in between resolutions right
5629800	5638120	now it has to either upscale to you know 4k or downscale to 1080 so it's it's just limited right
5638120	5642760	now by what's available but i don't know they can necessarily redesign everything that's not to say
5642760	5647480	that xbox is going to be the more powerful console because i know that like some games run a little
5647480	5653720	bit better on playstation 5 right now it just it depends on how the developer develops the games
5653720	5657960	for these consoles but it sounds like that on the xbox side of the house it's a little bit more
5657960	5665720	flexible with some of the enhancements they can do all right um yeah i think um you know some
5665720	5669160	everybody i shouldn't say everybody but there's a lot of people out there that always want to start
5669160	5674360	a war with microsoft versus sony but i think the time has come to kind of say you know what this
5674360	5679640	time around it's a very similar sort of thing the the differences between the two consoles i don't
5679640	5683640	and some people strongly disagree with this because of the the dual sense experience you
5683640	5688680	know on the playstation 5 in this but you know as far as like what's the more powerful system
5688680	5693880	like they're getting very close and a lot of these things are very nuanced you know that are
5693880	5697720	the actual differences between the two i don't know i just you know when i look at something
5697720	5703000	like no man's sky and how it plays on xbox series x how it plays on playstation 5 outside of the hdr
5703000	5711160	bug which they will fix it's looks pretty similar you know so yeah all right let's move on
5712600	5717880	phoenix 77 26 says it's pc the more powerful system and you know what for some people that's
5717880	5723400	always going to be the way it is all right let's talk about that and then there's nintendo uh
5723400	5727640	super mario 3d all stars remember that because that's still a big thing they're going to be
5727640	5733000	pushing through the holidays and then never again uh super mario 3d all stars just got
5733000	5738360	gamecube controller support that's actually pretty cool uh since after all it is you know emulating
5738360	5742760	uh super mario sunshine in a way now you can actually hook up a gamecube controller and play
5742760	5747240	super mario sunshine the way it was meant to be played you know speaking of analog trigger or
5747240	5751320	speaking of you know the triggers that you know have the different pressures that was the thing
5751320	5756440	on the gamecube controller that is lost with the switch so that's kind of neat that that is back
5756440	5762520	now um so yeah if you can find a gamecube controller adapter that is uh and a gamecube
5762520	5766520	controller but they're still around you know obviously the smash community really loves them
5766520	5771160	um and you can you can find them have some usb ones though too that you can get that are not
5771160	5775960	necessarily i think they're like uh will the switch recognize them yeah they sell them at
5775960	5780840	the store you know um i think they're like that power a brand or something like that like they
5780840	5787080	have like all the third-party companies and make those cheaper controllers um i don't know if i i
5787080	5792040	would assume it has analog on it as well but i mean maybe that's an option if you can't find
5792040	5800440	the expensive ones now um the other big update with uh the mario 3d collection that will get
5800440	5805080	a lot of people excited is that you can now invert the camera controls with all three titles
5805080	5810520	yay because some people don't you know you get used to using the joysticks a certain way and then
5810520	5816200	it's inverted suddenly and it gets really irritating so uh they also give a vague other
5816200	5820520	general fixes have been applied to improve overall gameplay across all three titles
5820520	5830120	no idea what that means but okay so hero brain's been removed all right let's go to a simpler time
5830120	5835560	and uh take a trip to the gaming vault as we look oh my gosh i ran the wrong footage sorry
5835640	5840840	uh we're gonna go to a simple time and look at the classic game of the week which i might have
5840840	5846360	just spoiled but maybe not enough uh once a week dark soccer dives into the gaming vault and finds
5846360	5851880	a game that she thinks hey you guys should be checking this game out and uh once a month though
5851880	5856760	she decides to go into the pinball vault and choose a classic pinball that y'all should be
5856760	5861080	checking out and i'm sure you guys have no idea what's coming based on that two second oops i
5861080	5864760	just did but dark soccer why don't you surprise us all with the classic pinball of the month
5865640	5872760	it's medieval madness so um medieval madness was put out by williams um it was released in june
5872760	5883720	1997 designed by brian eddie programmed by lyman sheets um they made 4016 units and it has been
5883720	5892120	lauded as one of the greatest pinball tables of all time um so uh another thing about this it is
5892120	5898680	one of the few to have been re-released i will get to that in a moment i own the re-release
5899640	5908840	so um basically it's got sort of a medieval castle theme you know and so as you're playing in the
5908840	5916040	center of the play field there is an animated uh castle and it has a drawbridge and you know all
5916040	5921240	kinds of stuff going on with it and your primary game is is to destroy six castles by hitting the
5921240	5926840	castle's entryway with your pinball so a specific number of hits will lower the drawbridge and then
5926840	5933640	expose the portcullis then um it will get that to rise and then you can keep shooting it and
5933640	5939320	basically you get like light show and different points and everything and then it sort of falls
5939320	5944200	apart and then it puts itself back together for the next mode um it also has two trolls which are
5944200	5950520	animated targets um they are concealed below the play field and pop up during certain game modes
5950520	5957080	and for some reason i always have trouble hitting one of those damn trolls um it also um you know
5957080	5961720	you have like your your left and right lamps you've got your uh different orbits you have
5961720	5972360	a catapult ramp um and so uh this particular though game introduced a feature that prevents
5972360	5977560	a failed ramp from draining your shot down the middle between the flippers and that actually
5977640	5983560	was patented with this machine um another little neat thing about this rob do you
5983560	5989000	want to know who one of the voice actors in this game was uh no idea yeah sure who is it
5989000	5997080	tina faye really yeah the voice for the opera singer princess and the cockney princess
5998600	6004600	so i thought uh that was really cool so yeah tina faye was a voice actor in the game wow um
6005560	6011160	oh the bad class of the game has the game listed as medieval madness and then the cabinet art says
6011160	6020840	ye olde medieval madness um and you know it's it's a really just kind of fun you know
6022520	6028920	very kind of almost an odd game for its theme so your different missions that you have is
6028920	6036040	joust champion you have patron of peasants catapult ace defender of damsels master of
6036040	6042120	trolls and castle crusher you have different multi-balls um you have castle multi-ball
6042680	6050840	you have multi-ball madness which is really fun um and basically um you uh for each
6050840	6057480	madness that you complete that you get different number of balls so single is two two to four is
6057480	6065080	three and five madness is four balls then you have barnyard multi-ball um when you shoot all
6065080	6070040	the catapult items at the castle and then battle for the kingdom which is the uh it's a two-phase
6070040	6077800	wizard mode um and i'm not going to go into all the rules on it but um for uh you know it's got
6077800	6088200	so much going on with it um that uh it's just really kind of complex and really really just
6088200	6098680	fun um so uh as far as ways to play if you don't have access to the table which by the way um just
6098680	6103400	to let you know is that if you find an original medieval madness it'll go upwards of eight grand
6104200	6109240	if they're in pristine when they and this is a contrast when they were new in 97 they
6109240	6116840	were about three grand um so medieval madness was included in the williams volume one tables
6116840	6126840	for pinball fx3 um came out november 9th uh 2018 it was previously a dlc for pinball arcade until
6126840	6134840	june 30th 2018 when williams removed them off for licensing um it is a playable table um on
6134840	6140920	playstation 3 and xbox 360 versions the pinball hall of fame um the williams collection and it
6140920	6145720	was included for ultra pin so now here's where we get to the
6149320	6154920	they did uh two versions of it there's medieval madness remake and medieval madness remake limited
6154920	6163480	edition they all come with a new color dmd they have led lights on the play field
6165160	6171480	and we have the limited edition we had one on order and then as it worked out someone bought
6171480	6181800	one and we ended up buying it from them and this was released by a chicago gaming company
6182440	6188280	um let me see if i can get just a little bit more because it had some other pretty
6189640	6196040	pretty good stuff going on with this one like it had in fact uh you could get like a custom
6197160	6207000	uh topper for it um had all kinds of neat stuff like our particular one um actually has uh like
6207000	6212760	black legs on it it's really sleek looking but here's the here's the funny thing um
6214440	6223640	the um when you open up the um the you know the back glass and look inside um you know i don't
6223640	6230120	know rob have you ever seen behind the back glass on a pinball or matt have you i don't think so no
6230920	6235880	well normally with the with these older ones from the 90s you had a pretty large circuit board that
6235880	6243480	you know controlled the rules controlled all the mechanisms in the game and um this has a very
6243480	6254280	tiny like maybe uh the width of a postcard in square so um the boards on the on this is is
6254280	6260120	absolutely tiny and then of course the fact that it you know you get a color dmd with it which
6260120	6265560	i mean a color dmd by itself is i want to say 500 something like that when you're adding one
6265960	6276040	sort of aftermarket um but i mean it's if if anyone if anyone can find it i absolutely think
6276040	6281080	that it's it's worth having the remake is tons of fun um let me see if you can find what the
6281080	6287320	difference is with the limited edition um the limited okay so there we go i've got the chicago
6287320	6294440	gaming company's website on this so um you can get yeah there's a royal edition that comes with
6294440	6305400	the king of pain p-a-y-n-e um and it's a fully sculpted um uh eight inch tall uh has integrated
6305400	6313000	lighting uh that plays along with the game um and then the leds on it are interactive rgb
6315000	6322680	general illumination was listed as and so it alters your your experience as it changes colors
6322680	6330760	while you're playing um you have uh an extra large display so the display is pretty much i
6330760	6339240	want to say twice as big as the original display and like i said it's color um and uh and i'll
6339240	6344520	link this to people um it's the royal edition which is the one that we have it has the the
6344520	6351880	powder coated black legs so um the classic one is basically just what the classic table was like
6351880	6357000	right special edition is the one with all the leds and goodies and then there's the uh the
6357000	6363560	royal edition that has the topper and everything so we we got lucky and got the uh the royal
6363560	6369320	edition and i will link that in the chat room because i honestly think that it's worth looking
6369320	6378600	at it's a really fun table you know what's funny is that um it's uh it's not really my favorite
6378600	6383640	but i'm glad that we have one it's a really fun one to play um also to tell dark tuxedo
6383640	6389960	they haven't uh just started doing color dmds they've been doing color dmds i want to say for
6389960	6395480	at least the last decade so they're not a new thing they're just still expensive uh and one
6395480	6402680	of the cool things about color dmds um is that you can go in and reprogram colors on it um no
6402760	6408600	some of these newer tables was actually pretty cool like um we we have a metallica and we have
6408600	6417880	a acdc and uh when we got our acdc uh the previous owner instead of putting acdc in it i want to say
6417880	6424120	that he put in i don't remember what band he put in but it was a different band and um you know
6424120	6430840	so you could switch out like different audio so if they're a lot more uh modifiable now um but uh
6431640	6438440	i i really think that uh that if you see one of these in the wild and you have never played it
6438440	6448040	you owe yourself to play medieval madness like i said it is one of the the peak pinball tables by
6448040	6455560	many people's opinions um it's right up there with like i'd say adam's family you know as far as
6455560	6461560	beloved tables um theater of magic you know theater magic isn't a great uh tournament table
6461560	6466760	but it's it's up there with how well loved it is does that make sense oh yeah for sure maybe those
6466760	6471480	are some tables that i definitely love those other ones she named and this is a good one too so yeah
6471480	6479080	but i just like any game that starts off with i am the king of pain so there you go there it is your
6479080	6485320	classic pinball table of the month medieval madness all right check that out uh one of the
6485320	6489240	if you can find the original great and there's a lot of the the newer edition stuff out in the
6489240	6493880	wild too or or uh so somebody had mentioned in chat earlier california extreme kind of has the
6493880	6498280	original but with the modified uh colored uh display on it so which you see on some of those
6498280	6504600	old tables so fun all right let's travel around quickly and check out some rapid fire news
6504600	6509640	uh rapidly some other things happening around the industry uh bobby also pointing out that
6509640	6513720	medieval madness is also in pinball f pinball fx3 of course that's what we were just showing
6514440	6520360	there so yeah it's another way to get it i said that okay uh let's do rapid fire news loki
6521720	6529160	so apparently the whole lego mario um line has been doing very well um i know i have most of
6529160	6535080	them or i should say my kids have most of them um but they're not going to stop with just series one
6535080	6540680	they're actually going to be releasing a series two starting january 1st are they for your kids
6540760	6541800	or are they for you
6544840	6551720	my kids play with them i don't have them anywhere i may help build them sometimes
6551720	6558040	all right but it's mainly for them um so they got some brand new stuff including a
6558840	6565240	sets with a chain chomp in there uh they've got ones the wiggler and some new costumes including
6565240	6573000	the penguin and tanuki marios um some new blind bag character sets with the poison mushroom
6573640	6582440	looks like parrot paragoombas shy guys and ninjis which are kind of cool um yeah and then they even
6582440	6591400	have like a master your own like a create your own adventure maker set that has um one of the
6591400	6596440	koopa kids in there as well and it's kind of more freeform set no new starter set so i thought they
6596440	6601800	would add like luigi to it to like a multiplayer or something but they haven't done that uh but
6601800	6610040	yeah that'll be next year that'll be well they tend to do multiple series within a year and
6610040	6616280	considering that lego mario came out in august of this year i mean it's been running for about four
6616280	6621720	months so they have the opportunity to do multiple series when it comes out next year so
6622680	6628120	looks pretty cool so i kids are already wanting me to pick up all these so we'll see
6628920	6638280	we're a few sets shy of having the entire series one and then along with that where we did get a
6638280	6644680	tease that there's going to be a brand new map unveiled at the game awards for among us
6645480	6653800	and uh the new map is actually looks like a crossover map so it apparently is uh the top hat
6653800	6659320	clans airship from and i can't remember because my kids are telling me what it was i want to say
6659320	6665320	like maybe the sick man adventures or something like that um but yeah it it looks pretty cool
6665320	6670360	so new maps um pretty awesome to see some crossover the other indie games as well
6671480	6678280	neat all right well uh talking about game streaming as uh you know we've kind of brought
6678280	6683080	up previously on the show um there was some issues going on with the different apps being able to
6683080	6687640	have game streaming on ios but they seem to have found a solution and that is to do
6687640	6693240	web apps now uh we also talked about last week on the show that um app stadium which was like
6693240	6700200	a fan app to get stadia running on ios well uh i guess you won't need that anymore because stadia
6700200	6707000	game streaming is coming to ios via a official web app so uh that is happening the testing is
6707000	6712360	supposed to start several weeks from now um but it's nice to have that confirmation i suppose that
6712360	6716760	that is coming what's interesting is that stadia is not the only one talking about using an ios
6716760	6722600	web app this week nvidia uh brought their g force now game streaming service to ios
6723320	6730600	so they are also on a web app um it did launch uh this week it is saying beta though that way
6730600	6736200	you might run into some issues there but um yeah that is uh also out there so that's kind of
6736200	6743480	interesting um moving on to a story about the supplies for the xbox series x apparently
6743480	6750360	microsoft is expecting shortages to continue well into april um microsoft isn't talking about how
6750360	6754360	many consoles they sell anymore they haven't done that for quite some time and you might remember
6754360	6758280	earlier in the show i don't think they really care i think it's the game pass stuff they want
6758280	6763080	to keep touting um but anyway this is uh from that same conference where tim stewart the chief
6763080	6767640	financial officer was saying those other things i talked about earlier he also said that he's
6767640	6774200	seeing these shortages continue into the first quarter of next year meaning through march so um
6774200	6779000	whether the pandemic is to blame for that or high demand to blame for that or all of those things
6779000	6786600	um is unknown but um it's probably all those things to be quite honest so uh yeah unfortunately
6786600	6792040	those shortages will be continuing into next year um i noticed dark sakura stepped away is she back
6792040	6799480	okay yeah i'm back i'm sorry i had it i had my video off so no one would see me
6799480	6803080	nomming down on my salad no problem i just don't want to miss your stories
6803960	6813560	yeah no i can miss them it's okay um so there's a recent um a study from um it's an oxford study
6813560	6822840	that went to nintendo and electronic arts for um uh playtime for for different games so uh games
6822840	6828760	used in this were um animal crossing new horizons and plants versus zombies uh battle for the
6828760	6835480	neighborhood and the data uh led to uh well basically first of all it was to give a more
6835480	6842040	accurate understanding about how long people spent playing the game um and then um they saw
6842040	6849720	that they were able to find a correlation between uh the gameplay behavior and their subjective
6849720	6856520	well-being so that they could show that these video games have actually been really good for
6856520	6864040	mental health um and uh they one of the the things uh they said i'll actually read from what one of
6864040	6869240	the researchers said is uh they found that the player's in-game experience may be more critical
6869240	6873560	for their well-being than merely the amount of time they spent playing players who derive
6873560	6879640	genuine enjoyment from the game's experience more positive well-being so i think that's pretty cool
6879640	6883720	i could tell you that i mean shoot i would have probably gone nuts if i didn't have animal crossing
6885320	6896200	um so um also um uh itch.io is doing something a little bit different for black friday
6896840	6903640	um they're gonna run the sale like everyone else but they're gonna forgo their cut of the game
6903640	6910520	sales and give the developers that share of revenue for the day that's neat so um it's going
6910520	6919160	to be active uh starting at uh 3 a.m eastern time midnight pacific on november 27th so if a
6919160	6925160	developer wants to include their games in the sale then um they can lower the price of their games
6925160	6932840	during that and still make a pretty tidy profit so uh they also have a massive pay what you uh
6932840	6936200	that's right this was the one that they did before where they did the pay what you want bundle
6936200	6942840	uh for uh the n double acp uh legal defense and education fund so cool oh very cool
6944760	6949640	all right well let's move on and travel around the world and check out some release dates of
6949640	6954280	games that are coming out this week this is kind of the last chance before black friday
6955320	6960520	yeah not a whole lot usually comes up this week so uh we do have one significant thing so world of
6960520	6968680	warcraft shadowlands uh still coming to pcmx uh just dance 2021 on playstation 5 and xbox series x
6969640	6978840	we've got star renegades on playstation 4 vigor on playstation 4 and looks like last but not least
6978840	6986280	spirit of north enhanced edition on playstation 5 that is it all right well traveling over to japan
6986280	6991400	it's still you know the the thanksgiving holiday is uh not really an impact over there so they
6991400	6996360	still have a pretty full week for game releases uh and this actually all comes out on november
6996360	7002760	26th so this week on the nintendo switch we have zoids wild infinity blast is out as well as
7002760	7009000	food girls in a regular and limited edition uh moonlighter and saints row four re-elected the
7009000	7014200	japanese uh version of that is out this week uh all of that of course on the nintendo switch
7014200	7020840	um taking a look at the playstation 5 uh it looks like uh just dance 2021 is out of japan this week
7020840	7025880	as well as an ultimate edition of watchdogs legion oh that is paired with a uh non-ultimate
7025880	7031400	edition as well so japan gets their version of that this week and then looking at the playstation
7031400	7041080	4 for the releases there um koi suru otome to shugo no tatse reboot the shield 9 in regular and
7041080	7044840	limited edition well that is quite the mouthful i wonder if that is based off an anime that i'm
7044840	7050600	unaware of i'm trying to load the page to see more information off that um wow there's two
7050600	7055080	checks on the cover of this and one of them is pointing a gun at me so that's an interesting
7055080	7059720	piece of box art there but yeah i'm thinking that is uh based off an anime or manga um
7060440	7064520	but other things coming out in japan this week on the playstation 4 this is pretty neat the dead by
7064520	7070120	daylight uh is getting excuse me dead by daylight is getting a silent hill edition so they're
7070120	7074280	getting like a physical release of dead by daylight but with the silent hill stuff um that
7074280	7078760	was put out for that game not that long ago in japan maybe to get more the audience over there
7078760	7083400	excited about it of course that game continues to do um pretty well i see people streaming it on
7083400	7089000	twitch all the time uh last labyrinth is the other big release on the playstation 4 this week in
7089640	7091960	japan how about the uk dark sakura
7095000	7104360	so yeah uk stuff um so at any rate uh for stuff coming out um this week of course leading into
7104360	7113960	december we have for the 24th we have emporator rome we have football manager 2021 and it's real
7114040	7120600	football not american football um overcooked all you can eat uh that's on playstation

7144440	7152440	and then pang adventures buster edition also in the 27th all right we have a few more stories for
7152440	7157320	you guys before we open it up for questions from chat and further comments on things we either
7157320	7160760	have or haven't talked about tonight but we'll get to that in a little bit first we have some
7160760	7167320	more stories loki yes i don't play any grand theft auto online although maybe i'll change
7167320	7174760	and go back to it at some point but we did get a tease though that there is um some new uh stuff
7174760	7183400	coming to grant the federal line line soon so they've got the new uh ko perico heist uh which
7184120	7190120	is gonna be a uh new location in grand theft auto online so they actually had a small map
7190920	7199560	expansion new interiors and whatnot um we haven't really gotten any new map expansions since the
7199560	7205560	game launched um kind of disappointing we never really got any dlc for it aside from
7205560	7211640	grant the thought online i mean i used lost and damned and um valley gay tony were great in four
7212200	7217240	but we never got any story expansions like that and five which is kind of unfortunate
7217240	7223080	but started off they um teased it a little bit with this teaser trailer that launched
7223080	7229320	that kind of showed a little bit of this new location and then of course um now they have
7229320	7235320	new dead bodies washing ashore um they kind of go along with that as well but they're apparently
7235320	7239880	this brand new private island or something is going to be a new place that we can check out in
7239880	7245480	december and they're saying they're also announcing a new radio station featuring over 100 new songs
7245480	7253080	to get you dmca flagged on twitch right away yeah don't don't stream on twitch if you're
7253080	7260840	listening to that radio station so looking forward to checking that out all right well earlier in the
7260840	7267880	show i was teasing uh some stuff about playstation and perhaps their uh competitor to game pass and
7267880	7273240	uh this is all coming from some comments that were made by the uh ceo of sony interactive
7273240	7279880	entertainment jim ryan he was actually speaking to a russian outlet named t a s s about playstation
7279880	7284680	5 launching there because obviously the playstation 5 is all over the world now i know we
7284680	7290200	got it a week early in the us and japan but um the uk had their release this last week as well as
7290200	7294760	everywhere else in the world so there's a lot more interviews and such to support playstation
7294760	7301400	5 this week um he was asked about the competition with microsoft and what are some of the points of
7301400	7307480	differentiation and he actually said the that console wars it's not a term that he likes to use
7307480	7312920	or that he likes it's great that there's competition i think it makes us work harder it avoids us
7312920	7318520	getting complacent it's great that the consumer has a choice i think that's wonderful now that
7318520	7326600	led into a discussion on game pass there is actually news to come but just not today we have
7326600	7332200	playstation now which is our subscription service and that is available in a number of markets
7333000	7338360	let's take a minute to roll our eyes at that answer because that's not quite the same thing
7338920	7345240	um i'm sorry but it pales in comparison to what microsoft is doing with the direct emulation
7345240	7349560	of the older titles in the library now granted not everything is supported you heard too that
7349560	7355880	they weren't even talking that they're asked about um expanding that playstation plus gold
7355880	7361640	or whatever collection the playstation plus collection yeah they were talking about um
7361640	7364360	whether they were to expand it or not they're not even sure they're gonna do that
7365560	7373400	yep it's just it's just a bonus on top of playstation plus so um well games uh the game
7373400	7380440	wars are right around the corner they like doing announcements at those things so maybe
7381320	7387640	i i feel like it's too soon for sony to do it now when they did just put out that playstation
7387640	7392440	plus collection and a lot of people still can't get a playstation 5 i'm not sure this is something
7392440	7396600	they have to respond to right this minute especially when microsoft doesn't really have
7396600	7402120	first party titles for the new era on game pass right now i think sony wants to be thinking about
7402120	7408040	that for next year um but i honestly i would expect if sony is going to counter with their
7408040	7412760	own type of game pass and they've got some big partners involved in that that maybe aren't as
7412760	7419080	involved in game pass perhaps some more japanese centric companies maybe your capcoms your konami's
7419080	7425480	although konami's not really making games anymore but who knows um stuff from that library uh we
7425480	7432520	we might see that i would think e3 2021 is when sony responds to it officially but maybe sooner
7432520	7436280	who knows a game developers conference even though that's not really a news place so you
7436280	7439640	shouldn't look at it as one and plus it's the day and age the internet they can announce it
7439640	7445880	whenever they want but i i kind of feel like too early to see what the impact is going to be on
7445880	7451000	games pass right now with their console i don't know if they can really say that we're losing a
7451000	7455560	lot of sales because of that no they're both selling out they're both doing well that's why
7455560	7460280	i don't think sony has to respond till the next fiscal year and that's why i don't expect an
7460280	7467400	announcement before april that's my that's my take on it um you know that i think it's weird
7467400	7471000	that he said you know we have nothing to announce now he almost made it sound like it's coming soon
7471000	7475400	but i i think it's still way too soon playstation 5 is doing nothing wrong it's still selling out
7475400	7480360	and hard to get same thing with xbox series x now whether the pandemic's to blame for some of
7480360	7484360	those supply issues i don't know but they're selling what they're making so they've got to
7484360	7489320	be happy with that so i i'm sure they'll be looking to it next year i think we will see
7489320	7493880	something that's a little more elevated and i don't think they will enhance playstation
7493880	7499560	plus collection i think that speculation is right on the money i think uh playstation plus collection
7499560	7506040	was to try to give more incentive to get a playstation 5 when there is a lack of launch
7506040	7513720	titles sure demon souls sure the astro astro bot and uh that stuff but there's not it's that's not
7513720	7518040	enough you guys you know especially when you compare it to some of the prior launches when
7518040	7522360	you look at you know all the titles that were out there when playstation 2 is new so i just i
7523560	7528920	i think that was all and to be fair xbox has the exact same problem because they had to push a lot
7528920	7536760	of their stuff back every every week i i don't think microsoft has a single exclusive this year
7536760	7542760	now for the new systems i think the last one just got pushed back this last week was it mastermind
7542760	7546040	or what i don't remember what's called but there was another one that got pushed back this week
7546760	7553480	so oh was it that uh the one that was like that uh time loop one
7554920	7561480	i think so i don't i don't even remember yeah uh dj rama s says can you really call it a
7561480	7565640	console exclusive when the games are coming out on current gen systems twitch bobby blackwell
7565640	7571560	follows up astro's playroom is literally playstation 5 exclusive and i think that's it
7572440	7580600	i guess pre-installed technically demon souls remake is exclusive but yes that is a remake
7580600	7588040	of a playstation 3 game of course but um technically uh that that remake is a new
7588040	7593720	release and it's exclusive to playstation 5 uh bugsnax is not exclusive to playstation 5
7593720	7598920	it is also on playstation 4 it is free on playstation 5 if you have playstation plus
7599800	7603000	only on playstation 5 it is not free on playstation 4
7604120	7609480	it's very interesting and i hear it's not that bad of a game yeah i'm hearing it's kind of neat
7609480	7618200	yeah so all right moving on dark sakura with some classics yes how about the sega ages
7619080	7625720	i like sega ages yeah um collection yeah although some of the the 2500 ones were kind of weird
7626600	7635800	but at any rate um sega um has wrapped up the sega ages line um it's uh uh for the switch
7635800	7642680	sorry it's given us some really cool stuff we've been very happy very extensive um but what was the
7642680	7650280	most popular so it all really depends on where you are and so there was um an interview with
7650280	7658280	nintendo everything um so kodama reiko um uh okunari gosuke and uh matsuoka chiyoshi
7660040	7664040	in order we have the producer director then supervisor and then the m2 director
7664040	7670760	and we're talking about the biggest hit so in japan virtual racing was the most popular um
7670760	7677400	overseas they said uh it was sonic and then followed by outrun and outrun was super big
7677400	7685400	in europe in particular but they did notice um that p.o p.o got a lot of attention but that
7685400	7693480	was also only in japan i like p.o p.o yeah sega ages was a pretty good it was a good way of doing
7693480	7696520	the retro stuff because they did some really nice upgrades with that i still have to go back and get
7696520	7701240	a few i really wanted the fantasy star one where it actually mapped the dungeons as you were doing
7701240	7704520	them because that was one of the most tedious parts of the game with those dungeons and now
7704520	7713320	they actually map them so that's pretty cool i i i very much would have uh loved to um have
7713320	7720520	like just a big uh fantasy star like completely redone um with all those features as well but
7720520	7728200	like uh the full quadrology quartet yeah yeah i just say quartet because that's another sega
7728200	7738920	thing quartet yeah all right let's move on loki all right so uh this is kind of a cool little
7738920	7745640	tribute that they did in spider-man malice moralis so as you may remember uh chadwick
7745640	7751800	bozeman who played black panther in the marvel cinematic universe passed away this earlier this
7751800	7759320	year and as kind of a little bit of a tribute in the game they have hidden a bozeman way
7760440	7767400	bozeman way i guess and which is located on the stretch of 42nd street between third avenue and
7767400	7774600	first avenue and they said that this is um possibly to um because his breakout film i
7774600	7782680	guess was in this uh a biographical film 42 and that um it's kind of a tribute to that so it's
7782680	7788440	kind of neat to see that the developers give him a nod in this game as well because he was
7788440	7795320	so influential um with the fans of you know definitely the marvel universe so um yeah it's
7795320	7801080	pretty nice yeah and i highly doubt that's the last tribute we see in a video game either or
7801080	7809480	yeah media period yeah all right well speaking of other media um our last story tonight has to do
7809480	7815800	with the last of us officially getting a tv adaptation we've had rumors of it we know that
7815800	7822600	one was being shopped around well guess what hbo is picking it up um hbo has been doing a lot of
7822600	7827000	interesting stuff recently you know obviously i'm sure you all heard the news this week about hbo
7827000	7833080	max and how they got the wonder woman 84 uh release so because obviously theaters are
7834360	7838680	not really a thing right now in most parts of the country at least where we live for sure and where
7838680	7843240	i think many of you are in big cities there's not really theaters i i guess some cities are still
7843240	7848840	doing it but you know every place is handling covet differently the reality is new york and la
7848840	7854520	the two biggest markets don't have theaters right now um so it's hard for movie companies to really
7854520	7861160	do a release especially of a big budget film like wonder woman 84 bobby blackwell is pointing out
7861160	7865560	in his area they're open they're just not very packed that's right just because they're open
7865560	7869160	doesn't mean people are willing to go because of everything going on people know that there's a
7869160	7876120	risk with it um so anyway uh hbo is uh gonna be getting that wonder woman 84 movie it will come
7876120	7883000	out on hbo max the same day it's in theaters which i believe is christmas the 25th um is
7883480	7890120	so that's interesting uh and uh you know we know that disney plus has uh mulan and they the rumor
7890120	7898120	is uh that cruella deville movie uh with what's her name playing cruella that reminds me of
7898120	7904600	victoria what's emma stone is that her name that's it she's playing cruella that rumor is that that
7904600	7908040	movie is going to end up being a digital thing on disney plus and i think there's a couple others
7908040	7911640	on the disney front i didn't even know that was an actual movie that's coming out yeah there's a
7911640	7916280	there's a picture of their out there of her as cruella she looks the part she looks really good
7916280	7923560	and she for those of you that remember victoria on shaking and crying uh the the day i saw what
7923560	7929560	was that movie that she was in with anna ferris the sorority girl damn it i can't think of that
7929560	7934760	movie there's a comedy and it was like how funny the house bunny yes that's it thank you the house
7934760	7941000	i don't know how i know that but i do you know what you just won jeopardy congrats so uh the
7941000	7945400	house bunny when i saw that movie the very first thing when i saw emma stone i was like oh my god
7945400	7949480	this is victoria and i texted victoria and i'm like you need to see the house bunny because this
7949480	7954760	chick is you this is funny so and then victoria ended up meeting her because she went to bra she
7954760	7959400	was in a broadway version of uh cabaret or something anyway i'm really getting disconnected
7959400	7966520	sorry but one tangent leads to another um anyhow so how did i get on and oh yes the digital releases
7966600	7973000	on hbo max which is trying to build themselves up because this is the new reality we're in now
7973000	7979480	everybody wants a netflix and we knew this was coming netflix hulu cbs or whatever they're
7979480	7983880	going to rebrand it as paramount or whatever it's called uh what are what are all the others i can't
7983880	7991480	even name them all now uh hbo max uh what are the other pay tv stuff peacock peacock uh we
7991480	7997560	technically don't have to pay for that one right yeah so anyway there's they're all out there so
7997560	8004120	hbo max is going to be going through with their uh adaptation of the last of us to enhance that
8004120	8008440	and that's another one of those places where i think netflix and what they did with the video
8008440	8015320	game adaptation of the witcher can kind of yes it was a book but you know it definitely reminded
8015320	8020200	a lot of people in the video game uh and it led to other video game stuff too which netflix has
8020200	8024840	had great success with castlevania and all that other stuff anyway so now other streaming companies
8024840	8031400	are looking to video games for potential stories so the last of us is happening uh hbo has confirmed
8031400	8036840	that the writer and creative director behind the last of us neil drachman will pen the series and
8036840	8042920	produce the series it's going to be alongside the creator of chernobyl uh craig mazin sony
8042920	8049320	playstation productions will produce the series what was i didn't even know there was a sony
8049320	8053240	playstation productions what was the last thing they would have done the tester tester
8055160	8063560	i don't know anyway the series will be about the first game so it will not necessarily be
8063560	8068680	the second game i don't know if that's for a season two or what that what happens does it end
8068680	8073320	up going like the walking dead where it completely outpaces i don't know we have to see how the first
8073320	8080120	season does first but hbo has greenlit the production and um that's that's it it's moving
8080120	8085320	forward so we'll see when it's going to come out probably i would say earliest is like holiday next
8085320	8090360	year and that's that's cutting it close uh especially with all the covid stuff i mean i know
8090360	8095400	they're filming things again with precautions and stuff but they might put it off especially if they
8095400	8100760	want to have like hordes of zombies and things they they might put it off for a little bit so
8100760	8106520	there it is all right now we're getting to your part of the show the listener round table where
8106520	8113400	we invite your comments via chat and your emails at participate at orange lounge radio.com i'm not

8130120	8135800	always happy to uh jump in there read them uh anyway and usually we would do drag race talk
8135800	8140680	here but that's a show i haven't watched in months i i know they have all the the way behind
8140680	8147080	they have like drag race holland drag race canada drag race spain is coming but i'm i'm i'm worn out
8148440	8155240	yeah you're you're all drug out you're dragged yeah you got dragged all right but if you guys
8155240	8159480	have uh questions or comments in our chat uh we'll open it up quickly for some chat comments
8159480	8165800	over twitch.tv slash vog network uh if you have some chat comments you want to get in here i will
8165800	8172680	ask though of course loki if you have any last minute stories of course so there was a video
8172680	8178920	put out by sack smashing um i think it was last week actually talking about the brand new game
8178920	8186360	and watch handheld system and of course the question is can you hack it um so he found a way
8186360	8195160	to hack the hack the game to um system to be able to inject a custom modified version of
8196280	8200760	super mario brothers to put you know hack mario brothers or whatever but that wasn't enough
8200760	8207960	because the the question that's always on people's minds is can it run doom and well he's managed to
8207960	8215880	get doom to run on it just a very stripped down version of doom that um he had to take some of the
8215960	8220920	textures out and everything because it is got very limited space it only has a one megabyte of
8220920	8227320	storage uh one megabyte of ram and so it's obviously very limited space that they could
8227320	8236840	run at but it runs sort of kind of in theory it runs do you have to is it so slow that you have
8236840	8241960	to play doom in that scaled down tiny window within your tiny window it is scaled down a
8241960	8247000	little bit it's not like for the game watch system i think it's about 80 of the screen
8247000	8252520	so i mean that's not bad but like that it's not a very strong processor that's in there in the
8252520	8258840	first place um and yeah with not having a lot of storage on there anyways i think we can rule out
8258840	8265640	like dumping a ton of nas games to it but it's still a neat hack yeah and if you want to play
8265640	8271720	doom there are literally five thousand other places you can play do anything else you name
8271720	8277400	it with a screen doom's on it a pregnancy test which is real yes i know pregnancy does
8280040	8286120	all right anything else that's all i had so one thing i noticed we didn't bring up tonight at all
8286120	8289720	it didn't come up on bobby's show it didn't come up here on this show i have to say something about
8289720	8297640	it it's that whole capcom stuff going on now the capcom there so there it's not a capcom leak
8297640	8304920	it's a capcom hostage situation um capcom had uh their information broken we have brought it
8304920	8310680	up previous weeks on the show um and they basically took all this information and were
8310680	8315160	saying uh you got to give us bitcoin or we're going to put the information out there uh they
8315160	8321080	did not give the bitcoin so the information's starting to get out there um that's up to you
8321080	8325160	if you want to go looking for that or not i kind of was like do i want to talk about it do i not
8325160	8331800	want to talk about it do i talk about last week at the end of the show yeah yeah and uh but well
8331800	8337080	there's more there's real specifics that came out within the last few days i'll say this much um
8337080	8341560	because this is one of those well of course this was happening me mentioning this of course this is
8341560	8346280	happening there's information there out there about street fighter six which okay that's one
8346280	8350200	of those of course it's happening at some point but there's information about that out there i'm
8350200	8356360	not going to get into the details because it does feel a little dirty at the same time here
8356360	8362760	at orange launch radio this is you know you know video games gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle
8362760	8366600	and unfortunately i think what's going on out there with all the news it's kind of becoming
8366600	8371240	a part of culture so i'm a little bit torn on the appropriateness of what there is to talk about
8371800	8378360	at the end of the day capcom may change some of those plans um there's things in there about
8378360	8384600	localized games and things you might be excited about uh and all that but 2020 and this year
8385240	8392600	may have changed everything so i wouldn't put too much stock in anything that would have leaked out
8393240	8398920	and uh if you want to go looking for that and looking up that information then you know whatever
8398920	8403560	but uh you know and i found it i've come across it's been hard to avoid on twitter but just just
8403560	8410040	know where it came from that's that's really all i'm gonna say i will say this i will mention one
8410040	8415720	of the things that they discovered that um i think this is one of the things where capcom wasn't
8415720	8419880	saying anything about it openly um but it's one of those things where when i tell you what it is
8419880	8425480	you'll kind of go like that is pretty cool that capcom is doing that and that is that it was noted
8425480	8433160	that capcom is making some real pushes internally to diversify things within their different games
8433160	8441160	to have more strong female representation to have more lgbtq to have more ethnic representation of
8441160	8445320	different races ethnicities and so forth around the world and what's interesting is they actually
8445320	8449000	were calling out like good examples and bad examples in the industries they were talking
8449000	8455160	about like last of us being like some good stuff uh for lgbtq at least a tomb raider for like
8455160	8463320	strong female characters um not so great uh old mario and old zelda but look at how zelda has
8463320	8469880	kind of transformed a little bit uh where it's no longer the damsel in distress but zelda's
8469880	8474280	you know you still can't play as zelda in the game i think that's coming in the next breath
8474280	8478760	of the wild but that's neither here nor there um but you can in the hyrule warriors and all that
8478760	8485000	stuff so it is interesting that capcom is making that push internally to do that so yes that is one
8485000	8491400	thing that the the uh ransom exposed but it's one of those kind of like well neat that capcom
8491400	8496680	wasn't going to trout information about look at the good we're doing but they are doing it
8496680	8503000	internally and they are having those discussions and that part's at least pretty cool so um
8504440	8510840	let's see oh no comments in chat really so that's that yeah so uh uh good luck to um capcom on
8510840	8516360	dealing with all that and uh the the apparently there is some information in there we kind of
8516360	8521960	got into it last week i don't think we need to say too much more about it um that's it i don't
8521960	8525960	really see a lot of questions in chat so i think we're at the point to to wrap it all up for the
8525960	8532360	night dark soccer's voice is spent i'm ready to eat i haven't had a lot of food today so i think
8532360	8536120	we're gonna wrap up let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts first off i want

8601480	8611480	uh dark sakura what's your final thought two things um i look at my blog gen x geeks dot com
8611480	8621720	g e e x and i want everyone to consider um going to random acts dot org and doing their uh 10
8621720	8628520	pieces of kindness challenge do your part to be kind to others and kind to yourself it's
8628520	8634200	it's absolutely worth it you might find that taking the time out just to do a simple kindness
8634200	8643880	for another person can absolutely change your day and theirs and my final thought on this
8643880	8650440	thanksgiving week is i am thankful to people who are canceling or heavily modifying their
8650440	8656040	thanksgiving plans because they're taking um what's going on very seriously and i find it very
8656040	8661560	unfortunate and um sad and in some ways kind of sick that there are people out there who would
8661560	8667640	make it a point to brag about how they plan to have you know 36 people together for thanksgiving
8667640	8673000	uh this year because um they don't believe in what's going on out there in the world and i
8673000	8678600	find that kind of sad that people would uh have such irregardless disrespect for other human
8678600	8686280	beings that they are willing to silently spread uh this particular virus um by continuing to do
8686280	8692200	this by being unwilling to make the small changes that are necessary for us to get through this
8692200	8697880	together so for those of you that are taking this shit seriously i thank you and for those that
8697880	8703800	choose to flaunt and brag and rub it in our face that i'm gonna do what i always want because this
8703800	8711720	is fake and made up a nice hearty fucksgiving to you loki your final thought i'm gonna be working
8711720	8720520	on my game because i got extra time off so oh really just focusing on getting all the core
8720520	8725400	coding stuff done and i have a lot of assets i gotta put together because i have a lot of
8725400	8730920	artwork and stuff and i found some more music to put in there as well so just have to get it all
8730920	8737560	in there in working order goals to have it released before the end of the year so still
8737560	8741880	shooting for that i'm gonna be thankful for the day i finally get to play your fucking game
8744520	8749880	all right sounds good all right thanks you guys stay safe out there happy gaming with all those
8749880	8754440	of you that are modifying your plans uh for this year uh i wanted to make sure i include heavy
8754440	8758440	modifications because i know a lot of people are gonna you know like some situations can't be
8758440	8763640	totally changed but people are making modifications so i'm sure this means that
8763640	8769160	you know thursday friday uh means a lot extra gaming time for those of you out there so enjoy
8769160	8775000	it play games to those of you that are working retail my thoughts are with you on friday i would
8775000	8780520	hope that this year is going to be different in that regard um unfortunately due to the little
8780520	8784760	rant i just gave i think there's some elements of it especially depending on where you are
8784760	8790520	that are not going to be different so um just my thoughts are with all of you hard-working retail
8790520	8796360	folks uh this weekend so that's it have a great week enjoy your video games we'll be back in seven
8796360	8803320	days to continue the discussion have a wonderful night everybody bye-bye you've been listening to
