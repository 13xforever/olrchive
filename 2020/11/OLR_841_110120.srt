00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,320
Hello! It's that time of year where I say if you're hearing my voice, it means that

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,980
your clock is set appropriately, where appropriately it is 6pm Pacific GMT-8, that is. Either that

3
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,280
or you're listening time shifted, in either case, thank you! It's the calm before the

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,600
storm in the year of our misery, and it's about to become exhausting in the home stretch

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,180
of the holidays. Don't get whiplash keeping up with the news. Before you turn on Do Not

6
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,940
Disturb and go for a walk, join our hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki as we

7
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,140
discuss the things we have, the things we're getting, the things we're not yet sure about,

8
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,420
starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:45,500
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

10
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:53,060
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again tonight with episode

11
00:00:53,060 --> 00:01:01,820
number 841 for this November 1st of 2020. My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me live

12
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,580
here on the feed tonight is Techmaster Loki. Hi, Loki!

13
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,920
Hello. How are you doing?

14
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,920
I'm doing fine.

15
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,220
It is good to see you. Sadly, we don't have Dark Sakura just yet. There is some type of

16
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,860
technical difficulty going on on her end with the computer reboot, so I expect her to jump

17
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,920
in here at any moment to join us for the show and we'll get things underway, that's

18
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,300
for sure. In the meantime, before we get into our kickoff topic for tonight, Loki, how's

19
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:33,700
the game progressing? This big mystery project you've been talking about for weeks and weeks.

20
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,700
I know nothing about it because you're very secretive. You're being a AAA game company

21
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,300
right now and I want to tell people about it. How is that coming along?

22
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,060
I thought about putting my own yellow text out, but I didn't.

23
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,260
Oh yeah, right. Oh yeah, we'll get into that later, that's for sure.

24
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:58,820
Yeah. No, it's going okay. So this week it's been, it was finalizing the random spawn generator,

25
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:08,540
which I did, and then hooking up audio, so I did that as well. And yeah, that's been

26
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,980
what I've been working on now.

27
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:14,140
Are you willing to say an estimated release date or are you afraid it's going to turn

28
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,180
into a situation similar to a cyberpunk?

29
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:25,700
Well, I can't say anything right now because I can't really go into more details about

30
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:32,540
that either because that would give stuff away. So I can't say anything because I can't

31
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:40,180
say any more. That's all I can say. I'm trying to get it. I'm hoping to have it ready this,

32
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:47,020
hopefully this month or even, you know, definitely this year. I can't, I can't really go into

33
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,660
more details. Sorry. Otherwise it would spoil things.

34
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,780
I'm going to get the details from your kitty, Stella. That's for sure. That's where I'm

35
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,780
going to get the details.

36
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,940
Yeah, she knows I'm on a call. So now it's, now it's time to start screaming at me.

37
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,500
That's okay. I'm expecting Smush to run in here any minute. We do tape live of course

38
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,800
at the voice geeks network, twitch.tv slash a vog network every Sunday night at six o'clock

39
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,180
Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And I'm trying to read

40
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,300
through chat on what's going on. Okay. I'll tell you what's going on. So one of my pals

41
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,820
from, so it was like a year ago on this show, I talked about that, that survivor LARP that

42
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,740
I was playing online that I won. Right. So one of my pals that played that game with

43
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,580
me, Karen, just joined the chat. So shout out to Karen. Karen and I never got to interact

44
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,920
during the game cause we were on like opposite tribes and we even got swapped opposite each

45
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,320
other. So I never really got to interact with Karen, but I've adored her everything I've

46
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,880
learned about her after the game. So, um, what is going on? So I'm looking to chat and

47
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:46,600
Karen joins and everyone wants to turn it into a discussion about the, the, the term

48
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,380
Karen, uh, that is used to talk about the whole, you know, uh, Kate from John and Kate

49
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,660
plus eight, I want to speak to your manager and all of that stuff. Y'all, y'all, how old

50
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,200
are you? 12? Like I thought we stopped making fun of people over their names. Knock it off.

51
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,160
Shame. Finally. My name is something you don't want to do to a bank so you can let people

52
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,620
live over their names. Good heavens. Good heavens. Where's my shame bell? Ding, ding,

53
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:17,180
ding, ding, ding. All right. Y'all know better, but I know, no, I know, I know most of the

54
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:23,220
time y'all are cool and I also know that everybody's just real tense right now cause there's a certain

55
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,860
thing going on in America this Tuesday that has a lot of people on edge and pointed and

56
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:34,580
with a lot of opinions on everything. So I get it. I get it. I just hope y'all have made

57
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,320
your voting plan. I've been talking about it for weeks and weeks on this program. Yes,

58
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:45,580
we play video games, but it's important to use those voices in, you know, what the government

59
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,460
gives you the right to do, what the constitution gives you the right to do and vote because

60
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:54,340
you're damn right. Government can influence what goes on with video games, right? We've

61
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:59,480
talked about countless issues here on this program, such as remember in California when

62
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:05,840
they were going to say that GameStop could no longer sell a mature game, but that concept

63
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,940
of what is a mature game was very kind of nebulous as to what that was. That's definitely

64
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,240
a political thing. So yes, politics can impact video games. So I hope y'all have made your

65
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,720
voting plan. Get on that. Just so you know, you know, with the election on Tuesday, if

66
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,840
you're planning to vote by mail, it's, it's kind of too late unless you already did it

67
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,960
in a lot of places. So that's why I told you two weeks ago to get your voting plan

68
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:38,080
going. But it's not too late to go vote in person. Or at least you can take. Hi, Jamie.

69
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,480
We hear, Jamie, we hear you. Just a moment. Jamie, we hear you. I don't think she hears

70
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:50,320
us. All right. So, but make sure that you take your ballot in person, if nothing else.

71
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,120
Don't actually drop that in the mail. So, all right. Good. Everybody and everybody in

72
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,640
chat is sharing their plans. Love to see it. Love to see it. Okay, so I think Dark

73
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:04,520
Sakura joined us. Can you hear me now, Jamie? Nope, she can't. She's, she's having some

74
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,960
issues, I guess. Maybe now. Maybe it'll be better. That's the joy of doing live radio

75
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,480
is that sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. But I see the little webcam loading

76
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,560
in. So hopefully we'll have a Jamie here in a minute. Hi, Dark Sakura. Can you hear us

77
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:25,600
okay? Okay, something, something weird is going on. But that's all right. All right.

78
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,560
Looking at some comments in chat. Black and Pat says surrendered my mail to early vote

79
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:35,400
in person. Okay. The break man says I live near the early voting place. It's been busy

80
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,580
every day. I've never seen anything like it. DGRama S says my polling place is three blocks

81
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:45,100
from my house. I'll be heading over after I eat breakfast. Good. Bobby Blackwell says

82
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,060
I'm going Tuesday. That's fine. If you're willing to do the waiting on the day of that's

83
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:56,900
that's totally fine. And we have folks not from America voicing their support. Karen,

84
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,380
who I mentioned earlier, says I'm Canadian, but I support you all. And Act Deaf brings

85
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,520
up the fact that I'm Mexican and the same goes for my part. So we appreciate we appreciate

86
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,740
the love from other countries. And we hope you all participate in the similar processes

87
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,660
in your countries if they are afforded to you depending on where you live, whenever

88
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,820
those elections may be. Okay. So we're still waiting for Dark Soccer to join us. Clearly

89
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,660
she's having some technical issues. We're going to try our best to get through those.

90
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,220
For now, I'm going to jump into the kickoff topic. I apologize. The webcam looks a little

91
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,020
weird. I just have to keep switching between when there's one person on Discord and when

92
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,900
there's two. But we're going to try to get into the top of the show here. So and our

93
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:40,100
kickoff topic. So, Loki, do you want to start us off on a kickoff topic? Because, you know,

94
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:45,020
we're only like not even two weeks from brand new game console releases. Right. And we have

95
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,840
a week. Yeah. Like just over a week. We have Xbox Series X. We have PlayStation 5 both

96
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:59,000
coming out in the next couple of weeks. So we have that coming. And we still don't have

97
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,460
all the answers as to how it's necessarily going to work, which is a little bit scary,

98
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:09,100
I think. Yeah. So. Yeah. So. So. Wait, hold on just one sec. Did Dark Soccer get in OK?

99
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:15,540
Can you hear us? For some reason, she still can't hear us, even though we see her fine,

100
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,140
so we'll have to figure that out. All right. Well, anyway, why don't you tell us what's

101
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:25,060
going on, Loki? Yeah. So we're the question's been, you know, especially with these consoles

102
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,740
now supporting backwards compatibility to a certain extent is, well, how much backwards

103
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:36,900
compatibility are they actually supporting? So with Sony, we're not really sure. They

104
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:42,300
said most games are backwards compatible. But apparently on Ubisoft, they had a blog

105
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:48,780
post listing that there are certain compatibility issues or certain games that wouldn't be backwards

106
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:54,220
compatible on Xbox and PlayStation. It said basically on PlayStation five, all games will

107
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,580
be backwards compatible, except for the following ones. Assassin's Creed Syndicate, Assassin's

108
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:03,620
Creed Chronicles trilogy pack, Assassin's Creed Chronicles India, Assassin's Creed Chronicles

109
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:09,580
China, Assassin's Creed Chronicles Russia, Risk, Star Trek, Bridge Crew, Werewolves Within

110
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:16,780
and Space Junkies. However, they have later retracted that blog post and just to basically

111
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:25,860
put a generic, you know, we pulled the Ubisoft Connect article and form regarding backwards

112
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,740
compatibility for the time being, as there may be some inaccuracies involved with the

113
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:37,260
Ubisoft titles that were playable on PlayStation five. So they haven't yet listed which titles

114
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:45,360
are going to be having issues on there. But I guess we'll have to wait and see. And this

115
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,380
is crazy because, you know, when we saw that list of what games would and would not be

116
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,220
backwards compatible or I should just say would not because it was very short list from

117
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:00,100
Sony. You know, there were 10 games on it. But with all due respect to the developers,

118
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,460
they were not 10 major games, they were games that people could kind of give or take, I

119
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:10,180
think. They were not, you know, you had nothing major on that list. But now Ubisoft is coming

120
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,900
out with this list. And I would say Assassin's Creed and those games and many of the games

121
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:20,180
that Loki made. Those are pretty major games. Now we're having an issue. So it's, it's a

122
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:25,720
little weird that we're finding all of this out like what not even two weeks to go before

123
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,000
the release of the console. Now, there could be a weird miscommunication. It could be that

124
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,200
maybe Ubisoft doesn't have the most recent development kits or something. Maybe there was

125
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,160
a late addition to the emulator software that Sony's working with. So maybe Ubisoft's been

126
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,960
doing their own tests, and they're not concurrent with Sony. That's kind of what I think is really

127
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,600
happening. I think Ubisoft is playing with one version of the emulator, and Sony's on the other,

128
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,760
at least that's what I hope. Because if it turns out that Sony has been kind of like,

129
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,520
I don't want to say lying to us, but that's what it's sure going to feel like. That's what it's

130
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,000
going to come across like. With the backwards compatibility thing, that is going to leave a

131
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,280
really sour taste in people's mouths. I just want to jump in here because I see Jamie on camera. I

132
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:13,640
want to know if we have her on the show officially. Hi, Jamie, are you with us? Okay, we don't hear

133
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,480
you. You're muted on Discord. I can see the mute icon. Oh, she's trying to fix it. Okay.

134
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:23,320
Try now. Hooray! You're here! The headset I'm using now has a kind of weird setup for the mute.

135
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:30,200
Basically, you know how I was using my work headset before this? I found on one of those

136
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:37,320
resale sites someone had a better version of my work mic, and I offered him 10 bucks for it,

137
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:43,000
and I got it for 10 bucks, and it sounds a lot better. Yeah, you sound great. Yeah, well,

138
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:50,120
the headset sounds great. I don't. Well, okay, I know you've been dealing with a little bit of

139
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,520
sick. Let's finish the Ubisoft topic, and then I'll come to catch up with Dark Sakura, okay?

140
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,280
All right, so I'm just glad you're here, and you made it despite all those tech issues. All right,

141
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,600
so anyway, the Ubisoft thing. So, Loki, what's your takeaway from this? Do you think this is

142
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:10,520
Sony's lion, or do you think Ubisoft is not testing correctly? What's your read on what's

143
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,600
going on here? I'm curious about you guys in chat too. I don't know what the issue is with it,

144
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,360
but they're not mainline Assassin's Creed games. They were the ones that were out like on the

145
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:26,280
PlayStation Store or the Xbox original, not original, Xbox Live Arcade stuff.

146
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:32,280
Those are basically the games that they had. I don't know. I don't really play Assassin's Creed.

147
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:38,120
I don't think it's a big deal either way. They're minor games. Maybe they're going to release a

148
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,160
different version for them. Maybe they're just working on backwards compatibility and it's not

149
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,720
going to be backwards compatible at launch or something, and maybe they're not willing to say,

150
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:54,040
oh, it's not going to work at all, maybe just wanting to give a certain date for it. I don't

151
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:59,480
know. It doesn't really matter. I don't think it's a big deal, but they could be a little bit

152
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:06,520
more clear about it because I know when we're talking about the other console, it is more clear

153
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,640
on what games that supports and which ones it doesn't. Going to our chat over at twitch.tv

154
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:17,880
vog network, Fifth Dream says, if your entire reason for being is playing old games or old

155
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,840
Assassin's Creed on a new console, just leave your PlayStation 4 plugged in. You're a small

156
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:30,200
percentage of zero percentage. Respectfully, I could not disagree more. Go ahead, Loki,

157
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,600
I'll get my content. I get that, but it's a value proposition because basically, say for example,

158
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,280
not everybody's like loaded with money to buy these new consoles. They're expensive.

159
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:43,160
And maybe the plan was I'm going to trade my old console in, get some money for it or sell it off

160
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,880
and then buy it because I heard that these games are backwards compatible on that console. So I'm

161
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:53,160
not really losing my library they've purchased online and I can use these console, this new

162
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,800
console to play those games. And maybe you're counting on that because you have some money

163
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,200
invested with this old console. So you can't really afford to keep both of them. Or maybe

164
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,600
you just don't want to have both of them hooked up. It's like, I know, you know, the PlayStation

165
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,280
3 games aren't really supported too well on that console and I don't want to have to hook my

166
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:15,720
PlayStation 3 back up or PlayStation 2 or whatever the case may be. I only have finite amount of

167
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:23,080
space around my TV. So I don't know. I get it. I get the argument that, yeah, maybe you could just

168
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:29,080
keep both plugged in, but it's not the most ideal situation. Right. And here's why I said what I

169
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:34,120
said about, you know, I really disagree with the comment. I'm sorry. And you're not alone in your

170
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,200
thinking. I've had to kind of respond to this a lot with my take on it. But I think especially

171
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,560
with this generation of games, we have new consoles that are really starting to feel like,

172
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:51,560
you know, PC or computer type of upgrades where, you know, a lot of the argument is really being

173
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:57,800
made on this, especially with a lack of launch titles on both sides. I mean, really, I mean,

174
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,040
sure. Okay. You have Miles Morales, which is also on PS4. You have the Demon's Souls remake. And

175
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,920
then on the Xbox side, you have like one or two things, but like, you know, Halo got bumped back.

176
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:12,600
So, I mean, on both consoles, I'm sorry, you have a relatively lackluster launch. So they're really

177
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:20,040
trying to make the argument on this is going to make your old games even better. And Sony's been

178
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,080
making that argument from the beginning. Think back to that early reveal when it was first

179
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,880
revealed in that, I think it was a Wired article about the PlayStation 5 and some of the technical

180
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:35,240
aspects of it. What game were they using to show off the PlayStation 5? They weren't using Demon's

181
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:41,080
Souls. They were using Spider-Man from the PlayStation 4 and showing how the solid state

182
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:47,560
drive could improve the loading times and improve the experience of the PlayStation 4. So my point

183
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:54,600
is, yes, people want to play the old games on the new console because both Sony and Microsoft have

184
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:00,120
been making the argument the old games will be better in this new experience. And that is what

185
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:06,920
has sold me on an Xbox Series X for launch day is because, again, I've talked about this on the show

186
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:14,280
before, I opted into Xbox Series X because my Xbox One is older and I never got into the One X, you

187
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,920
know, the incremental upgrade there. So I really feel like there are going to be a lot of old games

188
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,280
that are going to play a lot better on Series X. I am very much looking forward to revisiting

189
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:29,880
something like Forza Horizon 4, which is a beautiful racing game. I can't wait to try it

190
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:36,520
in 4K, 60 frames a second. That's going to be awesome. So that's, you know, to me, when they're

191
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:41,880
kind of like making the old generation a part of this new generation, that's why it's like really

192
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:48,680
dicey. I think that, yikes, suddenly these games may not work after all, but you've been saying

193
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,920
it's going to be better on PlayStation 5. I don't know if that argument makes sense. So,

194
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,040
DarkSakura, what's your take on backwards compatibility? I know, if I'm not mistaking,

195
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:06,920
you and Dan and your household is not opting into the new generation yet, right? No PS5 or Xbox

196
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:15,480
X for you guys, right? Yet? No, we're really not thinking about doing that anytime soon,

197
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,600
just because we got shit we don't play already. And you know what? That's totally fair. There's

198
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,600
going to be a lot of people that don't upgrade right away, and it doesn't make you guys any less

199
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:31,640
gamers. It's fine. Hell, the way the world is right now, the money thing alone is a barrier

200
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,960
for many people, and we all get that. But anyway, let me ask you a hypothetical. If you were going

201
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,680
to be looking into PlayStation 5 and that whole thing, how much does the backwards compatibility

202
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,440
factor, especially since, you know, DarkSakura, you're kind of the queen of the classic and the

203
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,400
retro here on this show, how much does the backwards compatibility stuff weigh in for you?

204
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:02,280
Not really at all, because I mean, I have the systems. I mean, that's the thing. I have the

205
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:11,800
systems. I don't need backwards compatibility. However, thinking in terms of the, I hate to say

206
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:20,600
the average gamer, you know, they may not have that, those older systems, they may not have been

207
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:27,080
a collector or have the capability to keep field systems, maybe traded it in to get the new thing,

208
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:34,040
and they have all this library of old games. So it would make sense that they would want

209
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:41,400
to maximize that for their user base, all of these companies, and of course, Sony themselves,

210
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,880
but that's logic. And they think with the bottom line, you know, if they can get people to rebuy

211
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:55,720
things, then that's all better for them. I don't know. I mean, I'm also coming from, I guess,

212
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:03,000
a little bit of an old school thought with that, you know, that if, you know, when we got our

213
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:10,760
Super Nintendos, we didn't expect them to play NES games, did we? When we got our N64,

214
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,240
we didn't expect it to play our SNES games. When I got my Dreamcast, I didn't expect it to play

215
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:21,160
Saturn games. So backwards compatibility is a little, it's a lot more of a new concept,

216
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:29,560
I would say, in terms of gaming, that it's a bonus that isn't required to be there.

217
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:34,680
Now the people have come to expect it. Yeah. I mean, I agree with that to an extent,

218
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,120
because we did have, even though Nintendo, you're right, Nintendo did set that standard with the

219
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:43,800
TV consoles, they had the opposite standard when it came to the handhelds. Game Boy Advance did

220
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,600
play Game Boy games, Game Boy, or excuse me, DS played Advance games, et cetera, et cetera. So,

221
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:54,440
I mean, I get it. It's sometimes there, sometimes not. So it's not totally fair to expect it as a

222
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,800
reality, but maybe it's also a sign of, and I don't know, maybe it's a sign of how much PC

223
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:05,240
gaming has started to come in a little bit. And I include Mac, all computers, and phones really

224
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:11,240
with that too, where the backwards compatibility thing isn't even a question because you increment

225
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,080
little pieces or you go to a new operating system or whatever, and the old stuff kind of works.

226
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,720
So I think it's interesting. Not always.

227
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:23,720
Okay. Yeah. Okay. With some exception. And for example, when they did several rereleases,

228
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,800
and I'm not talking about the Windows 3.1 days, I'm talking about just Windows 95 even,

229
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,040
you know, going me edition, you know, whatever was past that.

230
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,560
No, you're... Sorry. Go ahead.

231
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,400
But, you know, more I'd say in like the modern era of say Windows gaming, there are still

232
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,200
ones for pre-Windows 7 that will not run without emulation.

233
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,520
Fair. Because you're right. There is that whole, it's the 32-bit, 64-bit thing. And that came into

234
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,400
play on iOS and I think Android as well. For example, Flappy Bird doesn't play on

235
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,760
the newest iPhones because Flappy Bird, you know, the guy stopped making it and he pulled it and

236
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:11,000
it is not 64-bit or whatever it is. So it doesn't work. And that happened with Windows stuff too,

237
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,800
is that, you know, the newest Windows will not necessarily play all the old stuff stable.

238
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:21,560
So, okay, fair. You got me there. Although it is interesting where a lot of times the

239
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,600
hacking, cracking archivist community, I shouldn't lump all those things in together, but

240
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:33,000
the community that really works to preserve archivism, we'll say, finds these workarounds,

241
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,200
right? You can play classic DOS games on archive.org and so forth because people figure

242
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:44,760
out a way to get around it, right? So there is that. Exactly. Let's see. sj100matt says,

243
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:50,840
folks hiked PS1 through 4 backwards compatibility on 5 even though Sony never really said that they

244
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:58,600
were guilty. But I guess maybe after seeing Sony sell PlayStation 1 and 2 games on PlayStation 4

245
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:04,200
and so you knew it worked, you kind of hoped it would be there, but all right, fine. Anyway,

246
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,160
let's see. Some other comments on backwards compatibility. It's a nice thing, you know.

247
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:14,760
I'd say it's not entirely a major requirement, you know? But it's nice. I think it's something

248
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,680
that they do to keep their user base loyal. That's my thought.

249
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,560
no1special77 in chat says, even if you have the older systems, there are folks that want

250
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,320
backwards compatibility because they'd rather have one machine that plays both

251
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:32,200
newer and older stuff rather than multiple systems hooked up, which can lead to a cluster fuck of

252
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:37,320
wires. That is me. I would love nothing more. Actually, you know what I think one of the

253
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,400
coolest systems ever was? And Dark Soccer did a spotlight on it years ago when there was the

254
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:47,800
classic system of the month, but it was that Panasonic cube that did GameCube and DVDs.

255
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,320
So you could, or was it DVDs or something? But so you could have it all in one. So I would love

256
00:22:53,320 --> 00:23:00,680
nothing more than like a Play Xbox Switch that does everything. I would love that. I know it's

257
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:07,880
not going to happen, but. Or what was, we have the, oh God, what is it? That player that also

258
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:15,720
plays Sega Genesis games. You know, I still have my tech and BLEAM. Actually,

259
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,920
I got all the BLEAM casts. I wonder if like I could get a dollar for it.

260
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,960
I don't even know if he could get that. Let's see. Bobby says I have a BLEAM t-shirt still.

261
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,360
I have a sticker. Wow. Let's see. Quest Buster says I managed to get a splitter that allowed

262
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,000
my Nintendo and Sega consoles to share an RF adapter. It was great, but the back of the TV

263
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:45,720
was like elder God tentacles. And Brakeman says I dream of a future with no cables. It's coming.

264
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:52,440
It's coming because now a lot of the Bluetooth can send a lot of that stuff. Because Alan will

265
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,560
watch Twitch on his phone and he beams it to the TV. There's no native Twitch app on the TV. So he

266
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:04,280
watches Twitch from his phone on the TV and he does that through like Bluetooth. So, I mean,

267
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:10,040
I don't know if the... That being said, the item to which you're streaming must also be

268
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:14,760
capable of the same quality of the device you're streaming from. Sure. Oh, yeah, of course. Of

269
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:21,240
course. And I don't know if like lag and everything is like it's one thing for movies and TV. It's

270
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,400
another when you're actually playing a game, especially like a music based game or something.

271
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:31,800
Lag. Let's invent a concept like reverse latency and, you know, or inverse latency as Google put

272
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:38,280
out. Okay. So the lag may not allow for it yet, but I would say that technology is absolutely in

273
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:43,880
our lifetimes that we're going to have a game console top of the, excuse me, top of the line

274
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,360
that doesn't have wires. Well, it's going to have to plug in. So, well, maybe, no, maybe not. It

275
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:53,880
would just sit on a wireless charging thing or so. Maybe not. I would say within our lifetime.

276
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,560
TVs that actually are powered wirelessly. It's very similar to those wireless chargers, but

277
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:07,080
for a longer distance. So it is possible. It's just not entirely feasible yet. That's the only

278
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:12,040
way I charge my phone anymore is wirelessly because I got a dock for my car. My sister gave

279
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,600
me a thing she bought and she couldn't use and it was actually perfect for my car. So, and it uses

280
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,360
the wireless. You just pop it into the thing and you don't have to plug anything in or whatever.

281
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:25,400
It uses the wireless charging technology. So that way it's very easy to get in and out of there. And

282
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,880
then even when I'm charging at home, I just right by the bed, I have a little wireless pad, plop my

283
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:35,480
phone on there and it charges overnight. Perfect. So, I mean, we're getting there. The brake man

284
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:41,800
says, I mean, no wires, not even power cables. It's a future I dream of. Well, maybe not in

285
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:47,160
five years, but I don't know. We'll see. We'll see. Anyway. All right. Any last thoughts on

286
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:52,760
the Ubisoft and the backwards compatibility issue? I hope it's what I theorized a moment

287
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,720
ago is that Ubisoft does not have the latest version of the emulator that Sony has. I'm going

288
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:05,080
to really hope it's that and that it's just a miscommunication, but we'll find out in like 10

289
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:13,000
days, right? We'll see. All right. Well, let's move on to a segment called How Was Your Gaming

290
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,880
Week? And we'll start off with Dark Sakura. First off, since we had technical difficulties at the

291
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,240
top of the show, I didn't really get to catch up with you Dark Sakura, but you mentioned that your

292
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:27,720
voice was kind of iffy. So you've been a little bit under the weather, right? Oh, remember that

293
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:36,760
massive headache I had last week? It was the start of pneumonia. By the way, I am getting a little

294
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:43,880
bit of lag on the line, but we've had some crap going on with our internet this week. So yeah,

295
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:49,480
I went in having that really nasty headache and it hasn't quite gone away. It's just hung out

296
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:56,280
sort of like pressure on the back of my neck and on my head. And I started developing a little bit

297
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:04,200
of a cough and it felt like my sinus infections normally do, and I have chronic sinusitis. So,

298
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,800
I mean, that's just saying something. And so I talked to my doctor and I gave her my symptoms

299
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:15,880
and she's one of the few that has accepted that my body temperature dropped after I lost all that

300
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:25,960
weight. My normal is in the 97.4 range. So when I said that I hit regular normal, she's like,

301
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:34,360
that's a fever for you. Okay. And so as it went, she had me have a COVID test, which I'd already

302
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,200
had one at work, but I didn't have the results. And I don't know about those mail-in ones,

303
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:45,640
but both of them came back negative. And the one at Kaiser, well, this is my medical provider,

304
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:53,400
they also included the influenza. So I don't have the flu. So yay. But, excuse me.

305
00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:00,840
But my symptoms didn't get better. And actually starting yesterday, they got a good bit worse.

306
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:09,720
And I've had to use my asthma inhaler more than I like to. So I called the advice nurse

307
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:16,680
this morning. They booked me in with urgent care video, which is kind of cool that they're doing

308
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:26,280
that. And the lady's like, she was so funny, this doctor, when she looked at like my allergies and

309
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,440
the sicknesses that I'd had this year, she flat out said, Jesus Christ, girl.

310
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:39,240
So I was like, right. And, you know, I said, you know, I feel like I've got my cat sitting

311
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:46,920
on my chest except I am vertical. So she's like, oh, yeah. So she she's put me on some stuff,

312
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:54,200
which I'm on prednisone. I'm going to be a bitch this week. Just this week? Just teasing.

313
00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:00,520
Just go to your house and cough on me. Well, at least I know it's not, you know,

314
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,840
your covid negative, which is weird because you're describing all of these symptoms that

315
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:10,840
really sound like covid. But it's you know, it's not. And she she does want me, however,

316
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:18,040
to stay indoors as much as possible to treat it like covid, because not necessarily that I'm

317
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:23,400
contagious because I am not contagious, but more that it puts me at a higher risk.

318
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:30,200
And I want to say anyway, if you have a cold, if your allergies are really nasty, and I am not

319
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:35,240
saying this, I'm not a doctor, don't don't take this as medical advice, but it has been advised

320
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,600
that you take extra precautions when being around other people and consider shelter in place.

321
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,360
Yeah. Even if your area doesn't require it. Well, and I remember that was a big thing. Remember

322
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,360
when swine flu hit us all at O.L.R.? I gave you swine flu.

323
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:53,000
Yeah. Loki, did you get it or did you somehow did you get swine flu and we all got it? No,

324
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,360
so somehow you didn't get it. No, I don't think I did.

325
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:59,000
So, OK, so I don't know if I actually gave you swine flu and if I did, I'm sorry, but it's still

326
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,640
funny. It's whatever at this point, you know, I'm I'm still here to tell the tale. So it's one of

327
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,560
those things where and the reason why I bring it up is I remember a big thing with that is

328
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,880
you really had to protect yourself. And I remember when they pulled me out of work for a week,

329
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,480
even though I was feeling fine at that point, like the symptoms were long gone.

330
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,480
But it was all about it wasn't about me giving it to other people. It was about secondary

331
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:26,280
complications coming into me because, you know, I was I was teaching classes of 30 adults at the

332
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:30,680
time and you could easily catch something that could have made it a lot worse. So,

333
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,600
well, and, you know, I didn't even have any idea that I had it until you got it

334
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,720
because you were pretty much the only other person that I had hung around.

335
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,120
Yeah. And I don't know where I got it from. I mean, I went to back when they were still open.

336
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:47,480
I went to Sam's, the kosher deli. Yeah, it was years and years ago. So who knows?

337
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:53,240
It was it was just one of those things. And now it's like, because it can stay airborne for so

338
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,280
long and they're learning so much more about it. And I say that they should have been paying

339
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:03,880
attention to the mass culture in Japan and other Asian countries because they had the right idea

340
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:10,120
when you're sick, you wear the mask because you don't want to share it. And hey, people at work

341
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:15,240
usually give me weird looks that if I had a cough, I was always wearing a mask, but no one

342
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,080
around me would get sick. I thought that would be one of those things like when they talk about the

343
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:24,600
new normal, what it looks like after COVID is over. I thought our culture would kind of adopt

344
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,840
that take where like, yes, you wear a mask if you're sick. But now we have this whole problem.

345
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:33,400
And I don't want to go down this path here tonight. But you all know there's the anti-mask

346
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,880
movement and that whole thing. Right. So I don't know if that's really going to be there or not,

347
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,680
but I don't know. It's going to be interesting. Speaking of COVID though, I will say real fast

348
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:47,320
and I will thank again, you guys know I'm on the last episode of OLR, Shane was here. So I'm sure

349
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:52,200
some of y'all are curious how he is doing. And if he's in chat, please speak up and speak for

350
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,160
yourself, sir. But last I talked to him, he's doing a lot better. So that's yay, good news.

351
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,040
But he does say some symptoms are still lingering. I think he said it was like, I'm at 85%

352
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:09,480
and the doctor says that some of these symptoms can go on for a long time. Like he might be short

353
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:17,720
that 15% for months, which is really unfortunate. But I believe he has said to me something along

354
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,840
the lines of he'd rather have that than a hospital visit. So and I imagine if I had

355
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:28,760
COVID that my take on that would be very, very similar. So interesting take on the mask thing

356
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:34,280
in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network, as Joe and under Matt says, I for sure want to wear a

357
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:40,120
mask at conventions. Act Def says yeah, with the swine flu, it was more about getting worse by

358
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:45,800
catching something else. And I think I've talked about this several years ago. But I actually lost

359
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:52,200
a friend and she was only 24. And I did lose her to swine flu. It was a very different situation

360
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:58,280
from what we're dealing with now with COVID. But she caught it very early. She was in with

361
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:04,200
the whole thing. She was in Vegas for a mutual friend's 21st birthday. And look,

362
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,520
y'all know what happens in Vegas on people's 21st birthdays. I don't got to get into detail,

363
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:13,000
but it would be very easy to probably catch something. But what happened to her is that,

364
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,560
you know, she had swine flu, she was the first person in the entire county where we live to have

365
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:22,360
it. And then she caught something secondary. And that's what and it was so early on that they

366
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,880
didn't really I don't think they knew that that's what was happening. And that's why people were

367
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:31,720
passing. And then by the time she actually passed on the anniversary of this show, June 23rd.

368
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,000
So not to be a downer, but it's the reality of the situation. But by the time-

369
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,680
I lost friends with COVID.

370
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:43,640
Yeah, yeah. By the time October came around, which I think was the timeframe you and I got it,

371
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:49,800
maybe it was November, October, November, it was like doctors knew what to do. They knew to give

372
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,400
out the Tamiflu to prevent a secondary infection. They knew what to do better. And that's what's

373
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:59,720
made this whole COVID thing a little bit scary is that they really still aren't sure how to treat it.

374
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:05,640
And I think some people had a lot of hope when you know who the big one got, you know,

375
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:10,280
COVID and had that whole Regeneron thing. But now they're even saying it just came out this week.

376
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,160
Regeneron is probably not like they canceled the trial of that or put it on hold or something.

377
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,680
It's probably not what they thought it was. So that's what made that they still don't

378
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,760
really know how to treat it. And that's an issue.

379
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:26,200
The thing that people like my mother don't seem to understand is that like,

380
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,720
oh, they keep putting out something new every day. Well, that's fucking science.

381
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,520
Yeah, that's science.

382
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:36,680
When science finds out that it's wrong, it does the opposite of what all of these anti-massacre

383
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:43,400
people do and actually learns and puts out new evidence and says, hey, we were wrong about this.

384
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:51,320
Stop doing this. Here is the right thing. It's integrity. Science has to have that kind of

385
00:34:51,320 --> 00:35:02,040
integrity to be what it is. I mean, it's always changing. I'm trying to think, like 20 years ago,

386
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,680
we thought dinosaurs were big lizards and now we know they're giant chickens.

387
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:15,080
Yes. I mean, imagine living in a time frame when you realize, thanks to science, that this whole

388
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:20,600
time the earth is actually round. It's now been signed. Of course, some people still haven't

389
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:25,880
figured that out, I suppose. But for the most part, we all agree the earth is round because

390
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,920
science has proven that. Right. So, you know, you're right. Science does change. We find new

391
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:36,280
things, you know, the periodic table of elements. Sometimes we find new elements. It's exciting.

392
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:42,280
I mean, it's certainly not the thing that we had in science class and, you know, back in the day

393
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:48,760
when we were, you know, not before I was so decrepit. All right. Anyway, it's not to be

394
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,400
too tangenty, but it happens here on OLR sometimes. Back to gaming weeks. Let's talk

395
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,920
about our gaming weeks. Dark soccer. How was your gaming week? Well, of course, there was

396
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:05,160
Animal Crossing, but I did a completely different kind of game. Ooh. Yeah. And hey, if you can talk

397
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:14,200
about Survivor, I can talk about GISH. Shout out to Karen if she's still out there. Yeah. So GISH

398
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:24,760
is the, it stands for the Great International Scavenger Hunt. And it was arranged by Misha

399
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:31,000
Collins, who played Castiel on Supernatural, who is honestly a very decent human being, a really,

400
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:35,720
really good person. I think that show's been on since they thought the earth was flat, right?

401
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:41,720
That show's been on forever. Three episodes left, Rob. Okay. But it's been on forever. I'm not,

402
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:48,840
like, stop making me want to cry. I'm sorry, but it has been on forever. So nice. Even if they're

403
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:54,920
like, we could just keep doing this or we could stop on a high note. So yeah, but at any rate,

404
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:02,760
it's, and this one was a mini hunt. It was just over a weekend, but usually it's over a whole

405
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:08,440
week and you're given a list and they add stuff to the list during the week to just keep challenge

406
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:16,280
going. But you're awarded certain points for certain crafting things, right? So, and now that

407
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:22,120
the thing is over, I can actually show some of the things I worked on. Just real quick, I'm going to

408
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:29,080
step away. I have to deal with a smoosh situation. I'll be right back. Keep talking and move on to

409
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:36,760
Loki if I'm not back in time. All right. So, so basically what I, you know, it's different

410
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:41,320
crafting things. Sometimes it's baking, sometimes it's makeup. A lot of the different things in

411
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:47,400
there are going to be things like charity work. Like one of the things on there that I desperately

412
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:53,000
wanted to do was get my neighbors to contribute food to a food bank so that I could deliver it

413
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:03,080
and do a picture of me delivering it. But I have the Lurgee, so that was out. So, you know,

414
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:08,760
they're like, I have some pictures up here and I'm going to go ahead and link them in the chat room,

415
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:20,280
but it's on my Twitter at DarkSakura, S-A-K-U-R-A. So, one of the challenges was to make a gory

416
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:28,360
pastry so that when you cut it, it oozes blood. And so I made little strawberry hand pies, but

417
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:36,840
I had like a different, what's the word I'm thinking, rehydrated strawberries from

418
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:41,080
freeze-dried strawberries so that they kind of had this gummy texture to it. And I have that

419
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:49,000
seeping out of the little pocket pie. And then another one had to be a villain from a horror

420
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:57,400
movie cutting out coupons at the kitchen table. So I did Sadako. Yeah, you should see the pictures.

421
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,160
And I'll put up my other one because I misread that it had to be at the kitchen table. So I had

422
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:07,160
to redo my initial picture, but Dan took one of me in front of a static TV. So that was pretty

423
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:13,400
funny. But yeah, this one I had to do by myself because he wasn't here. So it's one of my black

424
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:20,360
wigs backwards and wearing like the leftovers from my Project Nunway outfit. And then, you know,

425
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:27,960
I had to pull some junk mail out to do it. And then another one was, if you have a friend that

426
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:33,160
lives far away, it's doing it like a cheer up jar for their mental health. And Becky moved

427
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:39,800
really far away for me. I mean, I have a difficult time getting out to see her. So I took these

428
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:45,080
little Maneki Neko cards that I had and put like a different, you know, like, hey, remember to

429
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:50,360
breathe, drink your water. On my picture I have, ugh, is a valid emotion. And another one says,

430
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:56,120
make today your bitch, you're lovely, you lovely hurricane. I added in some chocolate and some of

431
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:03,720
those C's lollipop minis. And there's also another letter in there that's like the open on a really,

432
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:10,200
really terrible day. And since Becky did come over last night, since I wasn't contagious or anything,

433
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,480
I was able to give it to her in person. And another one was-

434
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,640
I didn't know she moved. You said she moved?

435
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,520
Well, yeah, she moved out to Carmichael.

436
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,240
Oh, I didn't know that.

437
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,280
Yeah. But for me where I am, that's-

438
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:22,760
Yeah.

439
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,240
That's just, look, she bought her grandparents' house.

440
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:25,960
Oh, nice. Okay.

441
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:34,600
So the other one, instead of Elf on a Shelf, we did Ghoul on a Stool. And since ghouls look like

442
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,840
humans in the supernatural universe, I took one of my ball-jointed dolls and put her in a chair

443
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:45,480
on a stool holding a knife. So, I mean, those are some of the examples. You know, I also wrote a

444
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:51,000
Black Lives Matter haiku. I'll put that up as well. I did it, you know, and I made it look like

445
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:59,400
one of those inspirational quote things. But yeah, it's really good. Like one person did,

446
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:07,000
like, they had this, like, the Gish Mystery House type of thing. And it started off with

447
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,520
Misha and his son West at the Winchester Mystery House, you know, doing a flashlight tour

448
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,520
with clues. And one of the big clues was, like, another thing that we had to do. And it

449
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:19,000
was, like, using, like, code 13, but then on different lines and everything. It was pretty

450
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,520
cool. So someone had to build an expansive mansion in honor of the Winchester Mystery House

451
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:30,760
at a gingerbread. And someone did it. And I was actually on the live call where one of these

452
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,640
people presented it. It was absolutely amazing. I mean, it's, like, worth 130 points. The biggest

453
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:43,000
thing that I did was a video of myself casting a spell to revive my inner child that, of course,

454
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,720
didn't work because my inner child never died. So it's really good. And, of course, he's also

455
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:57,880
on the board for Random Acts.org. And so they have, like, a fundraiser right now through

456
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:04,120
GoFundMe to change a life. And so, of course, challenges involve donating to that and getting

457
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:08,840
10 other people not in your team to donate to that. I was on a team, by the way, me doing a team

458
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:17,720
effort. Go fig. But it was really good. It felt good to do something. And on top of that, it was

459
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:26,520
all perfectly socially distant friendly. It was little ways for people to be a part of things.

460
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:33,880
Now, when you sign up for it, you have two tiers. There is a $19 tier that's just, you know,

461
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:39,160
do the hunt. You're buying into it. And it's a fundraiser. It's for a good cause.

462
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:47,080
I actually, since this is going to be my first one and I wanted to do something really good,

463
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:55,320
I did the $99 tier. Well, because I also got bonus and reasons. I just have-

464
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,560
You don't have to just... It's your money. Spend it how you want.

465
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,760
Yeah. But most of the time, I don't have that to do. So it felt really good to do it. And I'm

466
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:10,440
going to get a bunch of goodies in the mail, so whatever. But it was... I got to meet new people.

467
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:16,360
I have two new Facebook buddies out of it. And it's people all over the country and the world,

468
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:26,200
really, who are coming together for a common cause to have fun together and ultimately to be kind.

469
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:34,360
And that to me... And it's something that they've been quoting from Biden is that... And I'm not

470
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:40,600
trying to sway anybody, but in voting, empathy is on the line. The character of the nation is on the

471
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:50,440
line. And if we can start individually, each one of us just doing different little kind things

472
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:56,920
during the day. Even if it's telling a stranger they have a cute shirt.

473
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,520
But six feet away.

474
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:04,840
At six feet away, yes. Or like today when I was leaving the pharmacy to get my meds,

475
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:09,320
there was a security guard just sitting by herself kind of forlornly looking out the window. And I

476
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:13,960
stopped across the desk. It was actually a good six foot distance. And I just asked her how she

477
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:19,880
was doing today. Hope she had a great rest of her weekend. And she lit up. And for some people,

478
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:24,760
that's all it takes. If you have an elderly neighbor in your neighborhood,

479
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,920
bake cookies and take it to them unless they're diabetic and then bring them chicken.

480
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:36,520
But there's different things that you can do. And I absolutely suggest checking out randomax.org

481
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:44,840
and checking out GISH. I think it's GISH.org, G-I-S-H. But definitely check them out. Run by

482
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:52,120
amazing people. All of them. And it's a lot of fun. And you get to flex your creative muscles.

483
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,960
And the community is just really, really supportive and really wonderful. Even if

484
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:03,000
you're on a different team, people who did the hunts in previous years will give you great

485
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,520
advice. They're absolutely amazing. And then Animal Crossing. That's my favorite.

486
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,520
Of course. Of course. All right. Loki, how about you?

487
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,240
And I did play Pirates of the Caribbean pinball finally.

488
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,600
Oh, where at?

489
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,440
It's pretty at my house.

490
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,600
Oh, not lucky. Nice.

491
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,120
Dan sold a few tables for it.

492
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,880
Ah, OK. Nice.

493
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:28,520
And we just picked up Monster something. I don't think it's one of the Elvira ones.

494
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:32,840
It's like, I think it's Monster Mash or something. So we just got that anyway.

495
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,720
All right. We'll move on to Loki. Loki, how was your gaming week?

496
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,680
Non-existent, really. Because like I said, I've been working on my game mostly.

497
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:45,960
I played a little bit of Orna, but that's pretty much it was just that.

498
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,640
But yeah, I really wish I could tell you what I was working on.

499
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,400
Have video already. I can't show you. So I'm sorry.

500
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,400
Why not? I'm starting to get on Bobby's side with this. Why not?

501
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,080
The only person stopping that is you.

502
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,680
That's where you're wrong. So.

503
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:10,360
Oh, OK. Interesting. All right. All right. Well, OK. So you've been working on your game.

504
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:15,240
We're waiting for that. All right. So my gaming week. So a lot of stuff that I usually play,

505
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:19,960
you know, I was I was I was out doing Ingress. I was doing my my cemetery creeping today.

506
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:25,480
And I realized pretty early on today was a bad day to do the portal scanning because oops,

507
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:33,160
today also happens to be Dia de los Muertos. And so the cemetery I went to, because my genius ass

508
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:37,880
picked a Catholic cemetery today, it was very crowded. And so there wasn't a lot of portal

509
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:42,840
scanning to be done, because while I will while I will creep at the cemetery, I'm not going to

510
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:50,120
totally creep at the cemetery. So there's that act. Act is clarifying it is tomorrow and today

511
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:54,520
is the day of all saints. Thank you. I suppose because it is still the weekend here, there's

512
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:59,000
probably a lot of people that are using today. You know what I mean? So that whole thing. So.

513
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:06,360
All right. So let's see. So I did that and I was playing Pokemon Go and I was getting infuriated

514
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:12,440
by a quest line because there's a quest line that you have to get nine nice throws in a row.

515
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:16,440
And you would think that isn't too hard because that's when the circle is full size. Not too bad.

516
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:23,320
It was like, try it, try it, because it's it's because what happens is that the monster will jump

517
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:28,360
or it'll move. And so you thought you had a nice throw and then it gets away. So I complained on

518
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:35,080
Twitter. And what do you know? Complaining on Twitter works. And what I mean is somebody told

519
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:39,880
me how to cheat and it works. And I'm not going to apologize for it because that task was

520
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:44,520
impossible. So y'all want to know how I cheated? OK. Yeah, of course you do. OK, so here's the

521
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:50,040
deal to get nine nice throws in a row. You want to build up a streak on your own like four or five.

522
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:55,400
But here's what you do. Once you get to about five. Tap on the Pokemon, you're going to catch

523
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:03,960
enable airplane mode, make your throw. If you get a nice throw, turn airplane mode off and reconnect.

524
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:08,120
If you don't get a nice throw and you botch it, close the app immediately without turning

525
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:17,320
airplane mode off. It worked. I got my nice throws in a row and I was so mad because I had a streak

526
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:24,200
going. I was on like eight. But what happened is that when I went to swipe to turn, because I do

527
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:29,080
the quick swipe to turn on airplane mode and the whole thing. When I did that swipe, you know what

528
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:35,880
happened? I threw the pokeball instead. It was a floop and I was like motherfucker. And of course,

529
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:40,120
it broke my streak because I wasn't able to turn on airplane mode. I accidentally threw the damn

530
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:47,880
ball. So I was punished for cheating. OK, I was punished once, but then I got it and cheating

531
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:54,680
worked. Yay. All right. So let's see. There was that. And then the other big news in my gaming

532
00:48:54,680 --> 00:49:02,360
world. I got my 4K TV on Friday. So I have a brand new TV. And so I was firing up some old

533
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:08,360
games. Although I kind of realized like, OK, on the PlayStation 4 Pro, there actually aren't a ton

534
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:13,640
of 4K games. There's just a sizable amount, but not a ton of stuff that like like not like there's

535
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:18,680
stuff like in there like Call of Duty that I don't really play. But Tetris Effect is in there. So

536
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:24,280
that was the first game I played in 4K was Tetris Effect. And I will say it is it is a lot. It was a

537
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:31,720
sharper. And I think I'm probably noticing the HDR stuff more because the colors are a lot more

538
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:36,280
vibrant than what I remember from before. And it's not and I wouldn't say it's like a huge

539
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,200
upgrade. It's not like going from standard definition to high definition. Remember how

540
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:45,400
that all blew our minds the first time? It's not quite that big of an upgrade. But I was I was

541
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:50,760
still pretty I was like, OK, this is cool. And plus, my new TV is five inches bigger.

542
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:57,800
And when it comes to TVs, size is everything like that. Five inches made a big difference.

543
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:05,080
So I was pretty impressed with that. So, yeah. And Bobby Blackwell says, if you have God of War

544
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:10,440
or Horizon Zero Dawn, those are the PS4 Pro showcase games to me. Horizon Zero Dawn is on

545
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:15,560
my list to look at this week. I was like halfway through the game and then I stopped. So I'd

546
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:19,880
probably have to start over because that's just how I play things. But I want to check that one

547
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:26,520
out. But I am really excited for Xbox Series X coming soon, where now everything will be in 4K

548
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:31,880
and the frame rate. And I'm just really looking forward to that. But that caused me to play like,

549
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:38,040
did you know Sonic Mania is in 4K? I actually played that. And yes, in all its great retro

550
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:46,360
pixelated glory, 4K glory. It was cool. And then what else did I play? Velocity 2X. I just randomly

551
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:53,080
came across it. I just wanted to hear the music. So I played the game again. And one other thing I

552
00:50:53,080 --> 00:51:00,520
will mention, I don't always like to base my decision of a game off the demo, but it's the

553
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:05,160
second time I'm doing it in less than a month. Because remember I played that Kingdom Hearts

554
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:10,520
Melody of Memories demo and it's not good. I'm sorry. Not sorry. It's not good. Bobby

555
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:15,480
Blackwell does this on his show. He based Ni No Kuni. He did that off that demo. So if Bobby

556
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:20,440
can do it, I can do it. And so there's another game I played this week where I'm like, I don't

557
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:25,800
know if I want to play this based off the demo. And this is really going to surprise you. You guys

558
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:37,640
ready for it? Hyrule Warriors Calamity Age is not great. Sorry about it. It's as good as it

559
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:43,720
would normally be on a, like, it's, it's the dinosaurs. I mean, it's as good as it normally

560
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:51,160
is. My kids love it. It's not like the frame rate is not great. The pop in is really bad.

561
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:56,840
The textures are not like, and it just like, honestly, when I was playing it, I was like,

562
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:00,600
the original was more interesting to me when I was experiencing that for the first time.

563
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:05,080
Yikes. I don't know if that's the limitations of the Switch. The game may not be fully optimized

564
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:10,280
yet either. I don't know. I did appreciate that they're trying to do new things to it. It is very

565
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:17,640
tied into Breath of the Wild and that lore. And it's very, very obvious. I don't think I can

566
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:26,920
justify dropping $60 on it on release. So, uh oh. So, uh, yeah. So in chat, I will be picking

567
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:31,160
it up because as of right now, my son is still playing. He's been playing it for like the last

568
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:37,720
hour or two, um, on TV. So yeah, I'll probably pick it up. You know what? You can disagree with

569
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:42,360
me. That's fine. You know what? I played Ni No Kuni and I liked it. So sometimes we're going

570
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:46,600
to disagree with opinions and you will probably enjoy. There will be many people that will enjoy

571
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:52,280
Hyrule Warriors and disagree with my opinion. I was just not, the demo did not excite me like I

572
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:57,560
thought it would. And to be fair, uh, the whole Dynasty Warriors series has kind of gone down

573
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:03,320
since 9. They've gotten really sloppy and like, it's just all over the place. So I heard the first

574
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:08,120
Hyrule Warriors is pretty good. So I mean, I enjoyed it. I played a lot more of that game

575
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:13,320
than you guys would think. I don't know. Maybe it's just a demo. Maybe it's early. And that's

576
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:17,320
why you would want to be, I would think you'd want to put your first, your best foot forward,

577
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:25,240
but you think it's in Tecmo Koei and they just do whatever they want. But, um, I don't know. Well,

578
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:29,480
I'll probably pick it up either way. My kids don't care. All right. That's fine. You know what? And

579
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:34,840
you know, I liked a lot of crap games when I was a kid too. I still stand by Friday the 13th on NES.

580
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:41,000
It was a good game, dammit. All right. But that's my kid talking. All right. Let's move on. Let's

581
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,160
talk about other stuff. That's it for our gaming weeks. I don't really have a lot of like housekeeping

582
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:50,120
or other announcements. No time off for the foreseeable future. No time off for anybody.

583
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:54,360
No, but I mean, you know, the holidays are not on Sundays this year and so forth. I don't know. I

584
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:59,400
don't have any out of town trips planned. Um, cause you know, with the pandemic and all, it's,

585
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:05,080
uh, not something we're doing very often. So there's that. So we'll move on. Let's get into

586
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:09,640
what's going on in the gaming world right now. And we'll start with Loki. Who's going to talk about

587
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:17,080
other Nintendo stuff. Direct. So, uh, we had a direct mini, uh, this week and they talked about

588
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:24,120
some new games coming to the switch and some, uh, mini, uh, announcements here. So of course,

589
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:28,360
one of the things they talked about was the Hyrule warriors, Age of Calamity free demo,

590
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:34,920
which is out now, check it out. Game comes out on the 20th. And, um, one thing that was kind

591
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,840
of interesting that they also talked about, which we didn't really get so much over here,

592
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:44,680
but it was definitely a thing that's been in Japan and other regions is cloud streaming.

593
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:51,880
So control is now out on the switch via cloud streaming, uh, assesses Crete Odyssey came out

594
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:56,680
in Japan like that, where you could play the game via cloud streaming because the hardware itself

595
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:03,320
can't really handle running the actual game, but it is interesting to see this being, um,

596
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:06,920
offered for yet another game. I would hope that would seem more kind of come that way.

597
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:14,760
Um, they showed off some more of, um, immortals Phoenix rising, running on the switch. Uh,

598
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:19,960
they talked about bravely default, uh, which is now coming out February 26th,

599
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:26,920
briefly default two, I should say, um, story of seasons is getting a sequel on the switch,

600
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:33,800
a story of seasons, pioneer of pioneers of all of coming out March 23rd. Uh, they talked about

601
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:39,560
no more heroes three, which is going to be coming out sometime, uh, next year. And then also, uh,

602
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:45,000
no more heroes one and two, um, are out now on the switch. So that was kind of a surprise

603
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,560
announcement as well. Uh, hit man three is also going to be coming, uh, to the switch

604
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:57,560
also with that cloud streaming. So that's also very interesting. Um, a game made by how laboratory

605
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:05,640
called part-time UFO, which I believe was a port of a mobile game is coming out soon. I think it's

606
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:12,920
already out. And, uh, what else? Uh, Tropico six coming to, uh, the switch getting important for

607
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:21,880
that, uh, uh, surviving it aftermath coming spring 2021. That's also another port. And in Grifflands

608
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:26,920
sometime next summer is when that's coming out. And so, and they said, this is the last one of

609
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:32,280
the year, right? So there's no more, no more announcements for 2020 after this. So, and in fact,

610
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:38,200
a lot of this stuff was for 2021. So, um, that's, that's it. So I got to say Nintendo's holiday

611
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:43,400
is, I mean, we knew this was going to be the case, but Nintendo's holidays looking a little thin.

612
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,000
Um, but I don't think that's going to stop the switch from selling. And I think

613
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:52,760
with the pandemic and everything going on, it's a understandable. And B I think they're,

614
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:56,840
they're going to be fine. I think they're still going to sell a ton of switches, just people that

615
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:01,560
extra one or a new one for their household. So they can play animal crossing for the first time

616
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:05,960
or the impressive library of games that switch already has. So I don't think Nintendo is exactly

617
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:10,120
going to struggle, but I think there's a lot of fans that are like, ah, I was hoping for

618
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:14,920
something a little bigger than maybe, you know, a new Hyrule warriors and some Wii U ports. Oh,

619
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:18,600
and a new Pikmin, I guess just came out this week, but that's also not for everybody. Right.

620
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:24,920
So, yeah. Yeah. All right. Um, I mean, Pikmin releases came, they really have, I mean,

621
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:31,720
come on, give, give some of the other series, some love F zero earthbound. All right. Uh,

622
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:37,320
but, uh, I would, I would say that the control thing was pretty surprising in the cloud gaming.

623
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:42,760
Have they, I guess they have done that here in the U S right. One of the resident evils they

624
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:48,520
did on the cloud gaming, didn't they? But yeah, seven, I thought, um, or yeah, seven,

625
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:54,280
didn't they bring it? I thought that was in, I can't remember some are only in Japan and I know

626
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:59,000
that this has been the thing in Japan for a little bit because we were kind of commenting on it that

627
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
like, oh, that's interesting. And I wonder when they'll bring that over here. Well, here we go.

628
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,480
Now we're seeing it with control. Um, okay. So Bobby has confirmed me. This is the first time

629
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:12,760
that the U S has had streaming for switch. So I I'm crossing the wires in my head and I, I gave

630
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:17,560
the resident evil thing, a U S release when we didn't actually have one. Um, but I do want to

631
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:23,400
say, uh, dark Tetsuya was talking about that demo of control saying it's only the first 15 minutes,

632
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:27,560
but it seemed to play just fine, but that's actually really good because that also kind

633
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:32,840
of lets you gauge, is this going to work for me or not? And so you can kind of see if that cloud,

634
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:37,080
as I've actually think that's a really cool, uh, thing that they did to do that demo,

635
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:42,680
to allow you to see is streaming going to work for you. So, so I wonder how far away are we from,

636
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:50,120
uh, X cloud support on the switch. You're not the first to suggest that I, I would be so

637
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:55,160
curious if that is really a thing. I know Microsoft would do it. I know they would,

638
00:58:55,160 --> 00:59:01,720
but it would Nintendo. That's the huge question mark. Uh, we'll see, uh, orange right in chat

639
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:06,360
says I did try it out a little bit just to see if it will work on my connection. It did. Uh,

640
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:10,440
they've been doing cloud games in Japan, assassin's creed, one of them, uh, those,

641
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:14,440
that comment again from orange right in our chat over at twitch.tv slash a fog network.

642
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:18,360
So the cloud gaming thing is, is very interesting and you're right. It's, it's going to open the

643
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:25,160
door to other things. I mean, you, you say X cloud, but we could also maybe have Luna

644
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:33,880
on the Nintendo platform. We could have, um, uh, stadia, LOL, maybe, uh, why not tell, tell me,

645
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:38,600
I can think of more reasons why yes than why no, especially from a technical perspective at this

646
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:44,360
point. So we'll see what happens. It'd be very interesting. I'll be curious if Nintendo wants

647
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:49,160
to adopt this streaming thing in their own games. That's what I'm really curious about.

648
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:54,200
We'll see, like offer them on other platforms outside of the switch. No, uh,

649
00:59:55,080 --> 01:00:00,360
deliver other technical experiences and other things via cloud-based gaming,

650
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:06,360
like allowing them to push what the system can do even further through the cloud. Perhaps when

651
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:12,200
switch pro becomes a reality that a person with a regular switch could still experience switch pro

652
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:17,640
games. Thanks to the magic of the cloud. I, I it's a tall order from Nintendo who sometimes

653
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:24,280
seems to lag behind, but Nintendo also has this random ability to get these random things right

654
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:30,040
on the money. For example, making a bang up AR game. That's a really impressive show of the

655
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:36,280
technology with that Mario cart game. Who would have thought? It is. Nintendo would do it, but

656
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:44,520
okay. I have a feeling it's going to go the way the lab. Oh, like it. It's fun for awhile. And

657
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:49,480
then you stop playing it. And that's the whole reason I didn't get it. I knew it would be fun

658
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:55,640
for five minutes, but that's it. But, but you have kids. Don't you think the kids will be into it

659
01:00:55,640 --> 01:01:07,400
longer? No, they don't want to set it up. So it's, it's fun and we could, I'm sure they'd still

660
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,480
want to play it once in a while, but it's like, it's not really engaging. It's not like something

661
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:17,400
that they would want to come back to all the time. They have trouble like setting it up. They don't

662
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:25,960
know how to like unfold the gates and everything, but, um, I mean, it's cool. I just, I think it's

663
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:31,080
going to get pushed by the wayside eventually, at least it folds down to a very small package.

664
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:36,520
And not unlike the, uh, lab stuff, which is just, well, was littered all over my house. I've

665
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:42,040
literally, I think I have thrown away some of the VR stuff, um, because it's just like, I'm not

666
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:46,200
going to play it. Uh, dark soccer. I'm sorry. What were you saying about Mario cart? You jumped in

667
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:49,720
there was something I wouldn't say anything about Mario cart. Oh, what did you say? Oh, okay. I

668
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:56,600
missed it. Sorry. I just said hard. Same. Oh, okay. I was agreeing with, with you about not

669
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:03,400
buying Labo because we knew it was going to be a waste. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Um, let's move on.

670
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:10,040
Let's talk about, um, things besides just Nintendo, uh, kind of a follow up, I guess, to another issue

671
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:15,000
that's been going on with the whole Twitch and the copyright crackdown and so forth. We're seeing

672
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:21,320
more and more games allow you to turn the music off, uh, or disable that element of the game so

673
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:27,880
that you can get around those types of issues on Twitch. Uh, and the game in question is FIFA 21.

674
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:32,920
Now this is notable because if I'm not mistaken, FIFA 21 is the biggest game in the world, right?

675
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:39,160
In the world. Okay. Cause remember Madden is like a very us based thing. When we consider the world,

676
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:45,960
it's about soccer and that's where FIFA is really a King of that. So, uh, FIFA 21 is going to allow

677
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:51,240
you to disable music, to avoid the copyright infringements. There was a title update that

678
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:54,520
went out. So it wasn't actually in the game to begin with because the game already came out,

679
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:59,560
but they did not in the game. Like don't they have independent volume between sound effects

680
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:05,160
and music. Hasn't that been a thing that's been like in games for decades now? Like how is that

681
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:11,160
now a notable thing? Like I understand like, um, the ability, like what they've had, like some

682
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:15,400
games, I don't remember the particulars, but there's some games that have like stream safe

683
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:20,440
versions where it's like music that let me, let me not license music. Loki, let me jump in. Cause

684
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:25,000
I think, you know, I want to make sure I clarify this. So there's actually a picture of the settings

685
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:30,200
menu I'm looking at, and there are options for menu sound effects, volume menu, music volume.

686
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:35,320
So you can do that, but this option is specifically disable all music for streaming

687
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:40,360
purposes. So my thought is there is probably a score of sorts in FIFA 21. Like there probably

688
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:45,240
is incidental music, background music, and so forth that is still in the game that does not

689
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:52,200
get removed when you do this. So, um, this is specifically for, and it is interesting that it

690
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:57,080
calls out and it even shows the option with the, uh, text at the bottom streaming or recording

691
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:04,120
FIFA, this setting disables all music to avoid copyright infringements. So, um, there is that.

692
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:08,760
So, but I will say, Loki, to your, your argument, the slider bar is also still there.

693
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:16,200
So, um, Bobby in chat says they use the license music for in studio sounds this, or in stadium

694
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:21,640
sounds rather this disables that orange, right? Says that's a really good idea. And Zen monkey

695
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:26,360
says, uh, Zen monkey 11 says, yes, you can lower FIFA music. Just lazy gamers, not looking at the

696
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:31,240
menu system. Um, orange right says, I know I'm thinking, ah, if I ever played burnout paradise,

697
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:36,120
that music volume is going all the way down. Yeah. And this is why usually when I play,

698
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:40,520
uh, these types of games I'm streaming in the, which isn't very often, I will usually stick to

699
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:45,640
classical music or I will have, which I has been pointed out previously. And yes, technically the

700
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:51,800
classical music is also because the recording itself is still something that is copyrightable,

701
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:56,200
but that stuff tends to not trigger strikes probably just because it is a very dear. It's

702
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:02,600
not, you know, it's not lady Gaga. That's the reality, right? Um, however, I also have a tendency

703
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:08,360
to, when I play those games, I just keep the game audio very, very low, either through what Loki's

704
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:15,240
talking about, or I just keep it so low that me talking over it constantly is just, it's going to

705
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:20,760
make the, you can barely even hear the music. And so I, and I haven't been flagged knock on wood

706
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:24,120
for anything on my personal channel and VOG certainly didn't, but we definitely,

707
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:29,000
we don't really stream games on this, hardly ever stream games on this channel. So, um, there is

708
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:35,560
that. So, um, we'll see. I heard another thing, by the way, since we're on the topic of Twitch,

709
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:41,640
I heard another thing. I don't know if you guys have heard about this and maybe Bobby in chat,

710
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:47,160
cause it was in discord, but somebody mentioned that Twitch mid-rolls were suddenly back on

711
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:52,760
certain streams that mid-roll ads were popping in. Is anybody in our chat getting that tonight? Like

712
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:58,760
are ads disabled? Because I have a hunch. What's that? Cause I tried to look on, on Twitter,

713
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:04,120
like with the tag, like what's going on. It seems like, and I could be wrong. It seems like the

714
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:09,800
people that are getting hit with those mid-roll ads are using some type of ad blocker on Twitch

715
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:15,640
or using something to try to suppress the ads on Twitch. So Twitch is kind of like one upping it by

716
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:22,440
putting these ads in a different way. So yeah, it worked out well for them. Yeah. Uh,

717
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:26,920
pixel pocket says it seems to me like some ad blockers stopped working. Act Def says,

718
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:31,480
considering that like 75% of us are subbed, I'm going to say no. You're right. We are very

719
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:35,240
fortunate that many of you are subscribed. Thank you for that. We're very lucky. Thank you. Thank

720
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:39,720
you. But surely there's a handful of people out there who are not subbed. And I'm just curious,

721
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:44,600
have you been getting mid-roll ads during the show? Because I watched, I watched a good hour

722
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:48,040
and a half of Twitch the other day. I didn't see them yet, but it might just be on certain

723
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:54,040
channels. I have no idea. So, uh, dark Tetsuya says I haven't seen any tonight watching on PS4.

724
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:57,240
I don't know how widespread it is yet, but didn't you get gifted a sub a couple of weeks ago,

725
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:01,880
dark Tetsuya? You might've been. Pixelbaka says I haven't gotten any ads so far this stream. So

726
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:08,920
we'll, we'll see. I don't know. I, again, I have, I hope it's not back because obviously we've

727
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:14,760
talked a lot about why that was a bad idea and we did a whole round table on this weeks ago.

728
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:20,360
If you haven't watched it yet, I, this is, this is why, even though, uh, Bobby and I recorded that

729
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:24,840
like the day after Twitch supposedly changed their policy, there's a lot of stuff in that that still

730
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:30,840
holds true. So go check that out over on YouTube or over at vognetwork.com. So, all right.

731
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:36,360
So anyhow, uh, but as far as the current Twitch issue that we know is out there with the copyright

732
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:41,240
stuff, uh, you'll probably see more games that are doing this, uh, that will help you be able

733
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:46,760
to stream on Twitch, uh, issue free. All right, let's move on dark soccer. You have something for

734
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:55,880
us, right? I do. And I had to remember that I don't no longer have my, uh, mute button on my mic.

735
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:03,160
So, um, I'm actually pretty excited about this and Dan actually was pretty excited too. He texted

736
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:13,640
me this, uh, so, um, arcade one up is, uh, doing pinball. I mean, pinball and, you know, that,

737
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:21,080
you know, is the magic word, uh, for me and in my house. So, um, they are doing, uh, a three quarter

738
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:30,200
scale, uh, pinball table, and it is going to be digital pinball. Um, there will be, um, uh, three

739
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:34,520
different ones that come with 10 different games. So to go ahead and start off with the first one,

740
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:39,320
it's Star Wars, uh, digital pinball. Then we have Marvel digital pinball and an attack from Mars

741
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:45,960
digital pinball, which I used to have an attack from Mars. So the games that come with, um, each

742
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:51,960
set, the Marvel games, uh, pinball includes Spider-Man, Civil War, Wolverine, X-Men, Thor,

743
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:57,720
Marvel's Women of Power, A-Force, Ghost Rider, Venom, Fantastic Four, and Fear itself. Star Wars

744
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:04,200
pinball has Boba Fett, A New Hope, Octo Island, Battle of Minbom, Darth Vader, Masters of the

745
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:08,440
Four, Star Wars Rebels, Han Solo, The Force Awakens, and Empire Strikes Back. That's a lot

746
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:15,560
of pinball. Um, now the attack from Mars pinball is actually real pinball. So, um, it's attack from

747
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:21,800
Mars, Fish Tales, The Getaway, Junkyard, Medieval Madness. I mean, right now getting that from

748
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:27,240
Medieval Madness, you know, um, Whitewater, which is another great one, although I'm sure it's not

749
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:32,440
going to come with the topper with the fan on it. Uh, Red and Ted, Fun House, which creeps me the

750
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:37,400
fuck out. Um, it's kind of like a giant head on it. The ones with heads freak me out. Uh,

751
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:43,880
Tales of the Arabian Nights and No Good Gophers. Um, Tales of the Arabian Nights, by the way,

752
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:51,160
is done by John Papadook, um, who, yep, you know what else he did? World Cup soccer and Theater of

753
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:57,000
Magic. Makes sense. They all have like a big thing in the middle of the table. Oh yeah.

754
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:01,800
But attack from Mars by itself is just a really fun one. Fish Tales is okay. We used to have a

755
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:09,160
getaway, um, which was a sequel to, um, great, no, I don't remember the name of the table. I

756
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:18,600
think I've covered the getaway. Um, I think that the, uh, that was a, uh, and I'm sorry,

757
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:22,520
it's going to, oh, it was High Speed 2. It was the, it was the sequel to High Speed.

758
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:30,200
Um, but yeah, it's, uh, it's really happy. No Good Gophers is a fun one. I love Tales of the

759
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:34,680
Arabian Nights. Fun House is, but it's a good table. Don't get me wrong. Whitewater is fun.

760
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:42,520
Medieval Madness though, um, for those who don't know, Medieval Madness recently had a re-release,

761
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:48,200
well, by recent, I mean, like a few years ago. We own one of the re-releases, like a special

762
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:52,920
edition of the re-release. Um, so it's missing like some of the branding on it and certain

763
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:59,400
things, but it is Attack from Mars. So these tables are going to stand, um, though they've

764
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:06,440
got a, uh, a 24 inch recessed screen. So it's going to be like, you're looking at it. It has

765
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:13,720
built an accelerometer so you can nudge and, you know, tilt if you screw up. Um, it is roughly,

766
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:23,240
I think three feet tall if I'm right. Um, and according to, um, uh, Arcade One Up, um,

767
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:31,160
on their site, it's supposed to arrive around December, 2020. Um, all of them, uh, it looks

768
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:36,680
like they're actually going to be sold physically through GameStop and Walmart. Um, and the Marvel

769
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:43,880
one apparently is already live for order at GameStop. Um, now, I mean, I, I, I'm reserving

770
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:49,720
judgment on the first two because clearly those are not like, and, but what I mean by legit

771
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:56,120
pinball is that they're not based off of legit tables, right? Right. They're the Zen pinball

772
01:11:56,120 --> 01:12:05,000
original creations. Yeah, exactly. But, um, the Attack from Mars one is I think the one to have

773
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:11,480
if you love your, your classic pinball, that would be the one that we would get. Uh, we would

774
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:19,240
have to move things. I'm tempted, but I don't have any more room for those machines. The burger,

775
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:25,960
the burger time one was enough. What? It's a little one. We got to work on the house thing

776
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:30,440
first, by the way, I got to do just a quick aside because people, I know you Dark Soccer and Loki,

777
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:35,560
you can't see my camera because of the intense tech rig that we have here at OLR. They can only

778
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:39,960
hear my voice. They can't see me like you guys can on Twitch, but a mysterious hand just dropped

779
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:46,840
this box in frame. And, uh, some folks in chat are asking, what is this? So what this is, Alan

780
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:54,520
just got back from Costco and he just dropped this in front of me. This is a pack of 40 Stroop waffles

781
01:12:54,520 --> 01:13:03,480
or Stroop waffles, if you will. 40 Costco sized box of Stroop waffles. The big one. This is big.

782
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:08,360
So I'm coming over. I'm not going to pay just, and my COVID test was negative. Dark Soccer is,

783
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:13,320
my COVID test was negative too about two weeks ago, but yes, hang out. This is, this is 40 cups

784
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:19,640
of coffee right here. Well, that's, you don't, you don't have to use coffee. You could use tears and

785
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:28,040
that's the way you're supposed to do it. You're supposed to put it on top of a cup of coffee

786
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:32,920
or, you know, whatever your hot drink is that you like, and that helps soften the cookie and

787
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:37,640
the syrup that's in there. So there you go. And there's only, I'm looking at it, there's only 140

788
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:44,600
calories in one Stroop waffle. So there you go. Latest Costco find from, uh, the husband. So thank

789
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:50,840
you, Alan, for bringing that to my attention and so much for any weight I was trying to lose.

790
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:55,480
See ya. Anyway, sorry, Dark Soccer, but, um, it was Stroop waffles. It's important.

791
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:59,720
Yeah. Well, at any rate though, I think that I actually already closed the article,

792
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:05,960
but I think they're supposed to retail for 500. Sounds about right. Yeah. Um, but yeah, um,

793
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:14,040
assuming that we do end up getting one, um, I think that we're gonna, um, I'll definitely,

794
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:20,120
we'll do something live for, for everybody when we get ours. Um, and by the way, Rob,

795
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:26,760
if you want to, I can send you my workout routine, which I'm still doing while I'm sick,

796
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:30,600
just a lighter one, because it involves my physical therapy. You know, it's interesting.

797
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:37,400
So the TV, the TV we got has all these built in things. And one of them is like a health channel

798
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:41,480
that has like workout videos on the man built right in the TV. And I don't know how good they

799
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:47,800
are, but, um, I like my workout videos, 1980s style. I want to see those obscene,

800
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:51,880
like tights that people used to wear in the, like the Jane Fonda workout tapes,

801
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:58,280
or I'm sorry, nothing will ever, ever top Richard Simmons sweat into the oldies.

802
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:06,040
I used to have the Cindy Crawford workout tape. Didn't share have a workout tape at one point.

803
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:12,200
Sure. Does everything she's a goddess, but this I'll tell you this right now that Cindy Crawford

804
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:20,680
workout tape was like a kick your ass. I mean, it was hard. And the fun thing about it is that

805
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:30,680
that is what got me into weightlifting when I was in high school. And, uh, after, uh, losing the

806
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:34,360
weight that I did, cause I was, you know, I was powerlifting before that and was building my dead

807
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:39,080
lift and I threw out my back. Um, I've been able to completely do my workout at home. I actually

808
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:44,920
wrote a blog for it, um, for, uh, Gen X geeks. Um, just, you know, putting out like what my

809
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:49,960
personal routine is, like what, what equipment that I have, cause it was really inexpensive

810
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:55,320
just to encourage everybody. So maybe. Chat, you guys are cracking me up. Uh,

811
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:59,720
Sia Tabiri says my grandma used to have the Angela Lansbury workout tape.

812
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:03,560
What? There was an Angela Lansbury workout tape. What?

813
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:08,280
Well I'm sure that the older crowd could make use of it.

814
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:14,920
So could the gays. We love murder. She wrote, come on. All right. Uh, let's see.

815
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:20,840
Sia Tabiri in chat says my sister and I each had one of the MTV grind tapes. Oh God.

816
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:28,680
Remember when there were shows on MTV, like the grind that was just people dancing. I mean,

817
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:33,880
that goes back to like, it was just soul train on MTV bandstand.

818
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,920
Is soul train still on? I think soul train is still on. It might be. I think they still do

819
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:46,360
make it in the Bay. What's his face? Dio Don Cornelius. Yeah. The Bay area had some

820
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:51,640
local TV show that was a dance thing too, because Mel was on it like twice.

821
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:57,640
Soul train ended in 2006, but they do have like the soul train awards.

822
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:01,720
Okay. Is Don Cornelius still alive? He'd know he died in 2012.

823
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:07,080
Yeah. Yeah. Anyway. All right. I used to watch soul train regularly.

824
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:10,360
Same. It was all that was on like Saturday morning when I was awake.

825
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:14,120
Right after my cartoons. It came on after my cartoons.

826
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:20,200
All right. Let's move on. We're running long on the show tonight. We got other topics to talk

827
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:26,040
about, but I know it's hard not to get derailed by Angela Lansbury and soul train. Uh, moving on,

828
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:32,040
uh, Oh, I got, I thought you were laughing, dark soccer, but that was coughing. I was like,

829
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:36,760
what's so funny? Oh, that's not funny. I felt it come. That's why I've been keeping my line

830
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:42,120
muted so that I wouldn't, you know, put lungs on the air. All right. Fair enough. Uh, Loki,

831
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:49,480
what's next in the gaming world? So, because, um, another, I think this bit's confusing. In fact,

832
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:54,440
I was actually talking with Exeter on Twitter about it because he had purchased a PlayStation

833
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:59,960
five with a place new PlayStation five HD camera. I'm like, Oh, what's that used for?

834
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:04,120
Because I don't think that's compatible with the PlayStation VR. And that's really the only thing

835
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:09,480
I use my camera for. And he's like, Oh, it's only for web, you know, for, um, you know,

836
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:16,760
broadcasting yourself on playing games and stuff. Um, so to solve that problem, because apparently

837
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:20,200
the PlayStation camera that came with the PlayStation four is the only compatible with

838
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:25,560
the PlayStation VR. And so if you want to play PlayStation VR games on the PlayStation five,

839
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:29,560
you need some way to plug it in since it doesn't have the proprietary connector on the back of the

840
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:33,960
PlayStation five, how are you going to do that? Well, the way you're going to do that is you go

841
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:41,960
to Sony's official website and you request a, um, a free cable. And the way you do that,

842
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:46,920
you have to provide them with the serial number on your PlayStation VR unit and your shipping

843
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:52,920
information. And they will ship it to you for free. So it may take up to two weeks to get that

844
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:59,800
in. Um, that kind of sucks. Although I want to say that like, it's something similar. They did

845
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:07,080
something similar with, um, the connect back in the day because the new systems that they made

846
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:13,160
the newer slimmer models had the connect port built in, but the older original, uh, Xbox three

847
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:17,480
sixties did not have that. And so you had to have an adapter to plug it in that that you could

848
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:25,240
request for free as well. Um, but still annoying that you have to do that. All these hoops to jump

849
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:29,000
through. I don't understand why the new camera, especially since it's a better camera, you would

850
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:35,080
think that it being a better camera might make it work better, but maybe, I guess it just doesn't,

851
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:41,960
maybe it doesn't protect the dot field or whatever it needs to track stuff. Just you would think that

852
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:47,400
they would support something like, I don't know, but whatever. It's a hope you got to jump through

853
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:52,360
if you want to use, you know, the PlayStation VR and the new system. And I'm still curious what

854
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:58,040
like, cause I know we're getting upgrades with faster load times and all that stuff for, um,

855
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:02,600
the PlayStation five and playing PlayStation four games. I'm curious to see what kind of

856
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:06,760
enhancements we get with PlayStation VR games. Since I know with the pro, we have like higher

857
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:10,600
resolution and more details and stuff like that. If we're going to get something similar with,

858
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:14,840
uh, the PlayStation five as well, or if it's going to go even beyond what was offered with

859
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:18,840
the PlayStation four pro. I honestly feel like based on the comments, I guess we didn't have

860
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:24,120
the related story tagged. I, maybe you saw this Loki about the, the comments from the CEO on VR

861
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:29,480
and how it sounds like VR is kind of on, I don't want to say it's like, it's like on hold for the

862
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:34,360
minute. It sounds like, like they're just not really making anything for PS VR right now. And

863
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:38,760
that's something they're going to revisit later on the PS PlayStation, the PlayStation VR too.

864
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:43,000
Yeah. Which is, I mean, I don't know. I have mixed feelings on it because I'm kind of like,

865
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:48,040
well, if the PlayStation VR is like the number one headset right now, like keep that train rolling.

866
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:53,720
And it just kind of like insert another joke here about Sony really not supporting their hardware,

867
01:20:53,720 --> 01:21:00,280
but at the same time X files poster, I want to believe, um, that they're going to, you know,

868
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:06,920
maybe focus on this part of PlayStation five and getting the games there for the more traditional

869
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:11,960
type of media first. And then they'll kind of take a good hard look at VR later with some of

870
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:16,520
the leaps and bounds that, you know, the VR technology has made such as potentially,

871
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:21,880
you know, that PlayStation four VR has wires, wires, lots of wires, and we know that VR is

872
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:25,880
getting more and more to a place where there's going to be a lot less or perhaps none at all,

873
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:31,720
perhaps, but you know, we'll see what they decide to do. Um, so I, Loki, I would just say

874
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:37,560
beyond the perks of loading times on the solid state drive and what the PlayStation four pro

875
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:41,640
could do. I wouldn't set the bar too high. Like it's probably going to be like playing it on a

876
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:47,960
PlayStation four pro. Yeah. Someone's someone needs to remind Sony that the V and PSVR does

877
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:53,320
not stand for Vita. So they probably shouldn't just forget about it. Well, and my question is,

878
01:21:53,880 --> 01:22:00,040
okay, so Sony wants to put it on hold, but what about third-party developers? So I guess

879
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:04,120
if they're going to continue to make VR games, they're essentially making PlayStation four VR

880
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:09,400
games. Um, that would be, uh, workable through backwards compatibility, but you're probably

881
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:13,320
going to see a lot of developers want to, I mean, you'll probably see less and less PlayStation

882
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:19,160
exclusives and more games that are like, you can play it on PlayStation four VR, or you can play

883
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:27,080
it on Oculus, or you can play it on, you know, HTC vibe and so forth. My assumption is when we

884
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:33,960
see the play, like if we had gotten a PlayStation two VR now, it probably wouldn't look very

885
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:40,120
different or it would be really expensive. And that's a lot to ask, put, put down $500 for a

886
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:45,480
PlayStation five and another $500 for the PlayStation headset. That is a lot to ask.

887
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:51,960
So I kind of understand the strategy behind, maybe we don't want to do the new VR headset this year.

888
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:56,920
Let's do that in a year or probably even better because of the pandemic and everything it's

889
01:22:56,920 --> 01:23:02,680
done to 2020. Let's do that in 2022. So that's my guess is you're going to see a PlayStation VR

890
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:09,320
two in 2022. And then at that point, it will be about, well, where is the technology for VR at

891
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:14,120
that point? How is that going to work into the very consumer friendly, you know, type of PlayStation

892
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:20,280
VR system. But I think if Sony really wants us to believe that they're invested in it,

893
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:27,560
I really want to see them make a game that is like for PlayStation VR two, not something that's

894
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:32,600
like enhanced or better with. I want to see that too, but I want to see them really make a game for

895
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:39,000
this PlayStation VR two. And I, I think that will probably be something to look forward to in 2022.

896
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:45,320
So from that standpoint, I do kind of get what they're doing. I mean, let's be real. If they

897
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:50,760
were putting out a PS five VR headset now, you would not want to pay for that and a PlayStation

898
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:54,680
five. You're just not, some people would, of course they would, but it's not going to be

899
01:23:54,680 --> 01:24:00,600
enough. So I understand why they're like, we're going to wait a little bit, even though they're

900
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:09,640
on the top right now of the VR game. So, all right, let's move on and talk about, um, a

901
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:13,400
company that I wish would get out of gaming altogether, but I'm a little bit biased, I

902
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:19,880
suppose. And it's Facebook. Uh, Facebook is getting into cloud gaming. Why not? Huh?

903
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:25,080
Everybody, another company to join the party. You've got Stadia. You've got Luna from Amazon.

904
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:31,320
You've got, um, X cloud. Why not? Let's have Facebook in this as well. So now Facebook has

905
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:37,960
launched their own cloud gaming service. Um, but here's some, are you going to be able to play,

906
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:43,480
control, or are you going to be able to play, I don't know, uh, destiny or whatever the

907
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:53,240
no, you can play asphalt nine legends, PGA tour, golf shootout, solitaire, Arthur's tale,

908
01:24:53,240 --> 01:25:01,640
and mobile legends adventure, which is pretty much cookie clicker, but as, as a, uh, RPG or

909
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:08,520
whatever. In other words, these are fairly mundane mobile games and look, there is a time and a place

910
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:14,360
for mundane mobile games. I love things like cookie clicker when I'm opening it for 30 seconds in the

911
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:19,240
checkout line at target or something. And then, you know, going on to whatever else is going on

912
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:27,560
as far as cloud streaming though. Uh, okay. This is a weird thing to launch, but anyway, if you

913
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:33,880
want to check it out, I guess you could find them in the gaming section of Facebook. Oh, by the way,

914
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:39,560
that's also where you'll find their, um, competitor to Twitch and that whole thing. And where mixer

915
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:46,040
ended up pointing people to, um, at some point there are going to be cloud playable ads in your

916
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:50,920
Facebook newsfeed. So in other words, if you're not opening the gaming hub enough, as you're

917
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:56,440
scrolling through your Facebook feed and endlessly doom scrolling, uh, all the updates and so forth,

918
01:25:56,440 --> 01:26:03,880
you're going to see not just an ad, but an ad you can play live. So it'll be like a gaming ad

919
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:10,360
you could just jump right into. Think about how the here's the thing. They're using it for gaming

920
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:17,720
now, but think about what this is going to be when bam, you jump right into a 3d virtual house tour

921
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:22,600
or you jump into, I mean, there's a lot of places I think where this technology could end up going.

922
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:28,280
And that's what Facebook wants to get into, I suppose. So, uh, this service is also coming to

923
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:33,800
the dedicated Facebook gaming app on Android. As we know, there is not a dedicated Facebook gaming

924
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:40,280
app on iOS because the cloud gaming and iOS have not, uh, figured that out yet. Although we are

925
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:47,320
seeing web based apps as a solution and perhaps that will come in the future. So, um, we'll see,

926
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:53,240
but nothing to say officially on that right now. So, uh, SHO and her mat says fairly mundane,

927
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:59,320
much like surfing Facebook. Uh, so there you go. Uh, Zen monkey 11 said the games sound like

928
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:05,560
clone apps. Yeah. I I'm not exactly jumping to reactivate my Facebook account so I can play

929
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:15,160
these games. Uh, I'll say that much. So anybody going to check out Facebook gaming? No. Okay. No.

930
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:24,040
I, I block every game request thing that comes across my plate anyway. So I, I hate them. I

931
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:29,400
don't want a game in Facebook. I don't want to play any of their shit. I don't want to give them

932
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:35,560
any more money. The only reason I have a Facebook anyway, still is for my sister's stuff and for

933
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:41,240
the communities I'm running. So I don't want to give them any more fucking attention. Remember

934
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:48,200
when the most annoying thing on Facebook was a poke is still fucking annoying. Can you still

935
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:53,800
poke people on Facebook? You can still poke. I have, I was up to like 400 with one of my friends.

936
01:27:55,240 --> 01:28:03,000
That's a lot of poking. Well, uh, did, did they, didn't they have a thing?

937
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,840
When they're an app called poke at some point, it was like their Snapchat competitor or something.

938
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:11,960
And it's, it's long gone. Uh, let's see sacred Jade and chat over Twitch TV slash

939
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:17,640
vog network says hard pass on Facebook gaming. I deleted my Facebook profile. Congratulations.

940
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:24,200
Um, I can't, I understand. I understand. I only deactivated and you know, I may go back as

941
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:28,840
especially, you know, after the election, I might be able to tolerate it again. We'll see. I'm

942
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:33,560
practically living on Twitter these days when I was like pretty much like a not Twitter person.

943
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:38,040
Twitter, Twitter is just a, it is, I get why Twitter is really annoying, but yeah,

944
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:44,440
Twitter is so much more cure curatable if you know how to do it because people get really

945
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:49,160
annoyed when it's like, Oh, you get your default Twitter feed that shows every, but once you learn

946
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:53,080
how to really curate Twitter and make it work for you, it's, Oh my God, it's, it's great. Now

947
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:56,600
it's not a perfect platform. Look at my wild at my life feed anyway. And then I check the people

948
01:28:56,600 --> 01:29:01,640
I care about. Yeah. Zen monkey 11 says I want my space back. Love the Twitter. So funny in there.

949
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:07,080
I want my space back too. I want to have, you know what? I I'm sick of this disagreeing on,

950
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:13,400
on politics and that whole thing. I want the fights to be about why aren't I in your top eight?

951
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:19,240
That's the fights I miss on my space. Jamie, did you have me in your top eight on my space?

952
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:23,720
I hope so. You know, as a matter of fact, I did. I think I'm pretty sure I had you there too. I

953
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:27,640
think I had, I think that was right. That was right around the time oil are launched. So I

954
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:32,440
think I had to have you and Loki in the top eight on my space. I'd have to look for my account

955
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:40,440
again, but I know that it was you and Jessica and Matt. And, uh, you know, I think my friend Risa

956
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:46,760
OLR had a MySpace. I know it did because we had clips of the show. I'm talking like early ass

957
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:52,440
fucking clips of the show on our MySpace page. So I doubt it's there anymore. I don't know. Good

958
01:29:52,440 --> 01:30:02,520
luck to you if you can find it. All right. Anyway, let's move on. Uh, let's oh, oh boy.

959
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:06,600
Let's follow up Facebook with a political story, but this was, this was a lot softer, right?

960
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:15,720
Yeah. I mean, and it's just kind of a, a little thing. Um, basically, um, in Fortnite, Joe Biden

961
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:22,600
has a map and might've covered this in the past that there was one with, um, animal crossing.

962
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:27,880
There was an animal crossing town dedicated to the Biden campaign. And I'll tell you,

963
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:39,400
I'll tell you what are, I mean, I, I, I vote blue, but I'm a socialist at heart and I, I am so in my

964
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:46,200
heart happy to see that it, you know, people embracing video games to reach that audience,

965
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:52,200
you know, who their people are, where all the GOP is still like, Hey, get off my lawn. Yeah. Um,

966
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:59,720
but anyway, um, yeah, there's a Fortnite map dedicated, uh, to, uh, to the Biden campaign and

967
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:09,240
to, uh, Kamala Harris. And, um, there's like, uh, different, um, different, like, uh, TV monitors

968
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:17,400
in there that have like different things like, uh, um, uh, build back better and like, uh,

969
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:23,560
this one screenshot here in subway, like there's no Malarkey station and Harris highway and all of

970
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:31,800
that. Um, and so, uh, but then the map is called build back better with Biden. Um, and it's

971
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:39,480
supposed to educate young voters on what the democratic party stands for. Um, and then, uh,

972
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:47,000
it takes you on like this adventure through this reboot city, um, where, uh, you can stay on like

973
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:53,880
this Island and you have many quests to do and you have to collect countless sneakers and check

974
01:31:53,880 --> 01:32:02,120
out Joe's ice cream shop. And so it is pretty cool. The code to get to this is, uh, zero two

975
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:10,200
one five four five one one one eight two three. Um, so yeah, it is pretty much, you know, it's

976
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:19,320
focused on, uh, on Biden's campaign and education. Um, but it's, it's a good idea. It's the type of

977
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:26,680
thing, you know, like what AOC was doing with, uh, with her, uh, uh, live streaming, you know,

978
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:34,680
and by the way, if anyone is interested for the animal crossing one and the Biden HQ Island,

979
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:43,000
the, uh, dream address code is seven two eight six five seven one zero seven four seven eight

980
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:49,960
da first, of course, because it's a dream address. No. Um, I was just saying, I just want to ask like

981
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:54,040
a serious question here because obviously, obviously it's no secret that I'm team Biden

982
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:58,840
on this. I mean, I was team Warren, but I, I, I, I'm more than happy to be team Biden when

983
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:03,240
presented with the other option. And I've made it no secret how I feel about that on this program.

984
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:09,880
But the, the hard question I want to ask is, is there really a point to this? Is there going to be

985
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:16,440
fun to be had here because video games are supposed to be fun or is this obvious propaganda?

986
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:23,800
Because I mean, what made AOC's Twitch stream really, really work is that it was very organic

987
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:30,280
and it didn't feel like even the politics that were in it did not feel forced. Her lines of

988
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:35,960
don't forget to vote and talking to the British guy about healthcare, uh, in, in his world versus

989
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:41,480
ours was that it felt very organic and it felt very much like a Twitch streamer, thanking someone

990
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:46,840
for the donation or talking to friends on discord. And I think that's why AOC stream, whether you

991
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:53,400
agree with her or not really worked is Biden's going to feel organic or is it going to feel like,

992
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:59,320
okay, I just went to propaganda Ville. It's not intended to be organic, not like AOC's thing,

993
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:06,040
but you know, it's intended to, it is, it is a campaign strat. I mean, fair and simple.

994
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:12,920
Um, in fact, with Biden's Island on animal crossing, like the house inside has, is filled

995
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:17,880
with like desk and campaign pamphlets and promotional materials. It's been turned into,

996
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:24,920
uh, a campaign office, but, but yeah, but the whole thing is it gets people talking,

997
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:31,720
it gets interest, whether or not you want to go to that either location in whatever game or

998
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:37,320
whether or not you say, Oh, well, you know, that's a stupid idea or he's just, you know, pandering,

999
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:42,040
you're talking about it. Fair. And you know, and you know what the answer might be? I'm actually,

1000
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:46,760
actually what ultimately where this goes is because this is in the news and you know,

1001
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:51,560
they know to an extent it's going to be in the news. Um, there are people on Twitch that will

1002
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:56,120
do a Twitch stream where it's like, I'm going to go visit the Joe Biden Island or I'm going to go

1003
01:34:56,120 --> 01:35:01,960
visit the Joe Biden, uh, Fortnite map. And now they're having an organic conversation about

1004
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:09,080
politics on their Twitch feed. And maybe that is this it's, it's not necessarily the map or the

1005
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:14,600
Island or whatever it is themselves. It's maybe the conversation that it starts. Well, and that's

1006
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:23,320
what I just said that. Yes, I guess it is. Yes. It's it's they're, they're talking about it. It's

1007
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:27,240
getting it out there and you know, and the people are going to be cool. Let me check the Biden thing

1008
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:32,600
because when it's, you know, it's going to get me clicks. I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm laughing

1009
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:36,680
because a headline just scrolled by, you know how on Twitch we have the headlines at the bottom,

1010
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:42,520
a headline just scrolled by that said from Kotaku bad cat. And that was the headline. I'm like,

1011
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:47,240
what the fuck video game is that bad cat? Did you guys see that?

1012
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:54,760
Um, Oh my God, that just, that actually last night, um, you know, one of the things I mentioned

1013
01:35:54,760 --> 01:36:01,160
I had to do for Gish was, uh, resurrect my inner child via a spell. Um, and Midna wanted to be a

1014
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:07,080
part of it. She wanted to run off with one of the GI Joes. I still have, she wanted to run off with

1015
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:13,480
snake guys, just saying, I mean, I would run off with snake guys just saying, but that that's bad

1016
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:21,960
cat, bad cat context to, to clarify what bad cat actually was in the Kotaku article. It's a mod for

1017
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:27,160
resident evil that turns, I forget what the giant like zombie thing is, but turns it into, uh,

1018
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:34,920
was it Tom from Tom and Jerry? Oh God. Okay. The tyrant.

1019
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:39,640
Okay. So, so it is video game related. So it was a game related headline. Who knew?

1020
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:44,280
All right, let's move on. We're running so long tonight. It's going to be,

1021
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:52,600
let's move on. Who's next? Uh, is it Loki? Yeah, it's me. Uh, so let's talk about a launch game

1022
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:56,440
that's getting delayed for the PlayStation five. So one of the games they were showing

1023
01:36:56,440 --> 01:37:00,600
off was destruction all stars, which was supposed to be launched title.

1024
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:09,560
Also one of those launch titles that's $70. Ooh boy. That's Sony upcharge. Um, it is now

1025
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:15,720
coming out in February, 2021, according to the PlayStation blog, um, as an added bonus as well

1026
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:21,080
for PlayStation plus subscribers, it'll be available for free for two months for no additional

1027
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:29,960
costs. So you'll get it as far as PlayStation plus that's better than paying $70. Yes. So it's

1028
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:35,560
interesting. It's very much a case of bad news. It's delayed. Good news. Uh, most people that are,

1029
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:39,560
you know, probably investing this money on PlayStation early are also PlayStation plus,

1030
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:45,880
so you're gonna get it for free. So yeah. Yeah. It's, I guess the news could have been a lot worse,

1031
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:51,560
right? That's true. That's the interesting thing. Halo got delayed, but it's going to be on Xbox

1032
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:57,080
game pass. And again, chances are, you know what, if you are adopting Xbox series X right away,

1033
01:37:57,080 --> 01:38:01,960
you probably have game pass, not everybody, but most people probably do. All right. Well,

1034
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:08,760
speaking of releases and, uh, games that got bumped back, uh, you'll notice what was absent

1035
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:15,400
from my gaming week already. World of Warcraft shadow lands. So that was a fun week and now

1036
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:21,800
we're back. But, um, and I did play a lot of Final Fantasy 11. Oops, but no, I, I, I'm, you know,

1037
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:27,240
what 14 Final Fantasy 14. Oh shit. I said 11. Didn't I? Sorry. Yes. 14. You're not playing

1038
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:32,920
11 without me. What? Sorry. Sorry. My 2006 brain kicked in the mobile version finally came out.

1039
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:38,440
No, no, no. Yes. If I was 14. Sorry. Um, but anyway, yeah, I don't know. I I'd be curious

1040
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:43,080
about the expansion. I just don't know if I'm $50 curious, but I know there's a lot of people that

1041
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:47,560
love their Warcraft and love their characters. And I am happy to report for all of you that shadow

1042
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:52,440
lands is finally going to be coming out on November 23rd. Hey, that's a special day for

1043
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:57,880
Warcraft because it is the 16th anniversary of the game. Um, not that 16 is often a number that

1044
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:02,040
gets celebrated unless you're an MTV show where, um, kids scream when they don't get the car they

1045
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:07,560
want. Uh, but for this sweet 16, uh, world of Warcraft shadow lands will finally be released.

1046
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:12,840
And, uh, there, it even comes out, it comes out at 3 PM Pacific time on that day because they have

1047
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:16,040
to do it that way because people all around the world are playing this game. And, you know,

1048
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:19,880
it's going to be a world rush to who can take that boss down first. So it goes live at the

1049
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:25,240
same time for everybody. Uh, so that ended up being a four week delay, which all things

1050
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:31,560
considered was not a terrible delay for the game. Um, but there's also going to be a warmup event,

1051
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:37,320
whatever that means on November 10th, where you will be able to take on a flood of scourge.

1052
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:41,560
I seem to remember when the last expansion was about to come out, there was an event like this,

1053
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:46,440
and it was a really easy way to gain levels fast. So I wonder if this will be a thing that's

1054
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:51,160
similar. I don't know, but November 10th is when the flood of the scourge happens. And also there

1055
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:57,720
will be season one of shadow lands on December 8th, I guess that's PVP and the first raid castle

1056
01:39:57,720 --> 01:40:04,280
nathria will also open on December 8th. So you can take your time getting to the new level cap of

1057
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:08,600
60, excuse me, uh, before you take on the raids. I actually liked that they don't release that

1058
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:14,920
stuff right away to be honest. So, all right. Um, pod culture points out, uh, November 23rd is also

1059
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:19,640
Dr. Who day. And you know, I imagine there's a lot of stuff kind of happening that day because it's,

1060
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:25,560
it's the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, right? Thanksgiving is the 26th, right? Or 27th,

1061
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:30,040
something like that. So it's, it's just days before, um, Thanksgiving. And that's like,

1062
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:36,280
you know, right before the retail season kicks off. Although I'm sure Black Friday, as we know

1063
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:40,680
it here in the States is going to look a lot different this year. You're already seeing stores

1064
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:45,560
like Best Buy and stuff are kind of like, we're going to start early and kind of push you more

1065
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:50,280
towards online for obvious reasons with everything going on in the world. I'm sure there will still

1066
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:55,720
be, I'm sure there will still be plenty of people that are going to the store on Black Friday, but,

1067
01:40:55,720 --> 01:41:01,800
um, not me, that's for sure. So, and I think, I think stores are kind of realizing they got to

1068
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:05,720
think outside the box a little bit that not everybody's going to want to rush the store,

1069
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:12,760
um, early that day. So, all right. Yeah. And DJRama S is, uh, uh, uh, kind of concurring there,

1070
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:18,280
uh, Black Friday deals done started. I'm good with this. Yeah, for sure. All right. Well,

1071
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:23,560
let's take a trip down memory lane when if a game was delayed by four weeks, we didn't know about

1072
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:28,520
it. Um, because we got our gaming news through magazines, there was no internet. It's the classic

1073
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:33,320
game of the week. Every week, dark soccer steps into the gaming vault to define a game that she

1074
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:38,840
thinks, Hey, you know what, brats, you should be checking out this game. Forget your newfangled

1075
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:45,320
Xbox series Xs and your PlayStation fives. I want you to go back to the PlayStation one. No way. I

1076
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:51,400
want you to go back sooner than that and check out this classic game of the week. Dark soccer.

1077
01:41:51,400 --> 01:42:02,520
What'd you pick for the kids tonight? I picked, uh, an RPG that is as iconic as anything else

1078
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:10,520
that this company has released. I picked Romancing Saga, which came out in 1992. It is a RPG, uh,

1079
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:16,280
developed and published by Square. It came out for the Super Famicom. Um, now it's actually the,

1080
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:26,280
uh, fourth game in the saga series. Um, and this particular one, um, actually had like a

1081
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:33,080
bunch of different, um, various releases on it. And it was a fairly, as far as some will say is

1082
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:42,680
kind of a big one. Um, this, uh, this one was actually, we made, um, for, uh, the Wonder

1083
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:49,160
Swan color. Um, it was done for mobile phones. Um, and I'll be getting into that, uh, in a

1084
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:59,640
little bit, but this is, uh, this is a game that while, um, not many people will think of in the,

1085
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:08,440
in the saga series. Um, it was one of the first ones that, um, so that's fine. Um, anyway, um,

1086
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:15,160
you, uh, you basically follow eight different protagonists on different quests throughout the

1087
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:22,120
world, and they all accumulate in a fight against the dark god, uh, Saruin. I guess that's how it's

1088
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:27,240
pronounced. That's always how I did it. Um, and it's very nonlinear. Um, you do have term-based

1089
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:35,480
battles, um, group formations, and like the other saga titles, there are no experience points. Um,

1090
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:41,320
your character attributes and skills are determined by what you do in battle. Um,

1091
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:51,160
so it was, um, you know, so the other saga games, um, this was supposed to be the, uh,

1092
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:56,680
the new one for the Super Famicom. There have been others on Game Boy. Um, they brought back,

1093
01:43:56,680 --> 01:44:03,080
um, the series creator, um, Kazu Akitoshi as the director, the designer and writing the scenarios.

1094
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:10,360
Um, and then, uh, the character designs were done by Kobayashi Tomomi, which actually is her first

1095
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:15,880
work that she did for the series. Um, music done by Ito Kenji, who also did like Final Fantasy

1096
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:22,360
Legend 2. Um, so it had a really, really good, uh, design group behind it right away.

1097
01:44:23,160 --> 01:44:30,200
So when you start off the game, um, you're going to choose your first protagonist and you're going

1098
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:37,320
to, um, explore the world. You know, it's free, free, free reign over everything. You know,

1099
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:43,160
you trigger different story points as you go through it. You have battles, side quests,

1100
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:49,480
and then you're going to build up your party as you go along. Um, some members, um, that you can

1101
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:56,920
recruit are the protagonist you didn't choose. Um, and so, uh, your progress is based on the number

1102
01:44:56,920 --> 01:45:02,760
of the main events, um, your strength, who you've talked to, um, and it's been called the free

1103
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:08,600
scenario system. Um, you encounter enemy sprites on the field, you fight with them, you have a

1104
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:15,400
three by three grill, uh, grid, um, that affects how you're going to be able to interact with the

1105
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:24,120
enemy. Um, so, uh, there, there was a big remake done for now. This is the big one on here, um,

1106
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:30,040
is it was remade for PlayStation two, which was subtitled, uh, minstrel song. It was released,

1107
01:45:30,040 --> 01:45:40,360
uh, by, uh, Squenix in 2005. Um, with, uh, this one, it does have, uh, the non-linear exploration,

1108
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:46,840
but the environments are all in 3d. Um, and it brought in some elements from the later saga

1109
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:53,080
titles. Um, and, uh, when you choose your, uh, you know, your protagonist, you go through the

1110
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:59,240
game the same way. You have a quick save, uh, you have a hard saves in, you know, your towns

1111
01:45:59,240 --> 01:46:04,760
where things like that are, um, and you customize your party, you have your character classes,

1112
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:13,080
um, and a character can lose their life points. Um, so like your character health is a combination

1113
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:17,480
of your standard health and your life points and you lose life points being knocked out enough

1114
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:22,760
times in a battle. And then you lose all of your life points. The game is over. So that's

1115
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:30,280
kind of an interesting take on it. Um, but yeah, it did, uh, it did, uh, start its development in

1116
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:36,520
1990. Um, and they really wanted to go to the super Famicom because the other saga games on

1117
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:44,200
Game Boy had been so popular. Um, and so, um, and actually we did get final fantasy legend three,

1118
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:51,000
it was a saga three. Um, but they really wanted it to be a particular saga game.

1119
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:57,800
The name Romancing, uh, actually, uh, was, uh, inspired by an American movie Romancing Stone.

1120
01:46:58,520 --> 01:47:05,640
Remember that movie? Like Kathleen Turner, right? Yeah. Um, and the producer of the game was, uh,

1121
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:13,480
Miyamoto Masumi, who was the founder and former president of Square. So, um, so yeah, the, the

1122
01:47:13,480 --> 01:47:21,160
game had, uh, a pretty big release when it came out January 28th, 1992. Um, and it was the second

1123
01:47:21,160 --> 01:47:26,200
super Famicom title that Square did. It followed final fantasy four, which we got, of course, this

1124
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:32,760
too. Um, it dated three guidebooks for it. Um, it got a virtual console re-release on the Wii in

1125
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:42,600
2009, Wii U in 2015 and 3DS in 2016. Um, it was supposed to have been, uh, uh, localized,

1126
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:49,320
um, to be brought out in the US. Um, it was, uh, stated by Gameport in 1993, but it never got

1127
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:55,880
released outside of Japan. Um, the text translation and complexity of the game they figured would be

1128
01:47:55,880 --> 01:48:02,280
off-putting and not cost-effective given what they projected this to be. Um, at any rate, um,

1129
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:08,440
in 2000, uh, they did a version, an enhanced version of Romancing Saga for the Wonder Swan

1130
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:15,800
color. Um, and we know that Square really loved the Wonder Swan color doing this out. Um, but,

1131
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:25,240
uh, it was, it was, uh, not on Game Boy Advanced and that's because Square and Nintendo, that was

1132
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:30,840
when they were having their thing when Square went to PlayStation, remember? Um, yeah, so all that,

1133
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:35,720
but they added, um, a few new abilities that you could dash and avoid enemy encounters,

1134
01:48:36,280 --> 01:48:43,160
um, different materials, a couple of stories, uh, changes, different side quests. Um, and it was part

1135
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:49,640
of the Square Masterpiece series of classic titles for Wonder Swan. Um, it was ported to mobile

1136
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:55,560
platforms by Square Enix. Um, it was based off Wonder Swan port. Um, they just did the graphics

1137
01:48:55,560 --> 01:49:02,520
for mobile. Um, it came out for, in 2009, for iMode phones, um, and then for the SoftBank phones

1138
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:11,080
and EasyWeb, and it closed, uh, down in 2018. So then there's the PS2 remake, which was Romancing

1139
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:18,760
Saga menstrual song. Um, and it was like rebuilt from the ground up, like I said. Um, and the,

1140
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:27,400
the art style references the sprite design, but tried to go a little bit more like some of the

1141
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:33,560
Final Fantasy series. And it has a completely different taste. It was meant to appeal strictly

1142
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:41,160
to, um, not really appeal to any particular market, just be something that's, that's

1143
01:49:42,040 --> 01:49:48,760
attractive overall. Um, and, uh, the game was re-released through PlayStation Network for

1144
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:54,600
PlayStation 3 eventually. Um, and then a special edition that had a download code and jigsaw

1145
01:49:54,600 --> 01:50:01,000
artwork done by Kobayashi, um, the designer. Um, there was supposed to be, uh, they actually

1146
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:07,560
announced a North American re, uh, release at E3 in 2005, um, along with, uh, Dragon Quest 8,

1147
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:15,240
Final Fantasy 7, and Kingdom Hearts 2. Um, it released on October 11th. They removed a

1148
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:21,960
menstrual song from the title. Um, they did, uh, some dubbing, um, done by New Generation Pictures,

1149
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:26,280
um, who had worked with Squenix on some of the Final Fantasy and Valkyrie profile series.

1150
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:35,960
And then there was a European released after that. Um, so, uh, this, uh, the original title

1151
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:41,400
wasn't remastered because we drew, I guess they dropped the menstrual song for us.

1152
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:45,640
It had really good music. I mean, I don't know how much of the video I let you listen to,

1153
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:51,880
but the music in this game is really top notch. It's just that got that square brilliance to it

1154
01:50:51,880 --> 01:50:59,560
as, as the RPGs on the SNES that most of the RPGs we did on the SNES, um, display. Um, so for the

1155
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:06,680
Super Famicom version, it is ranked as the fifth best-selling saga game of all time. Um, it is sold

1156
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:13,160
more than 1.3 million copies worldwide with 1.1 million, of course, sold in Japan and those others

1157
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:22,520
overseas. Uh, Hamitsu, um, didn't like the graphics as much as Final Fantasy 4, but they liked the

1158
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:31,560
system. And so, uh, Hamitsu score was, uh, 31 of 40 for Super Famicom, 32 of 40 for, uh, PS2, which

1159
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:37,240
by Famitsu, not bad, not bad at all. And I can actually see that criticism. I mean, I, I never

1160
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:41,880
played this game because obviously it wasn't, you know, released here until, uh, you got the

1161
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:46,600
translation hacks and the other versions you were talking about. Um, but I can see that criticism is

1162
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:51,880
that, you know, especially these battle scenes look very plain, I guess. And even the world maps,

1163
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:56,760
they look very plain compared to Final Fantasy 2, which is what we would know it as in America,

1164
01:51:56,760 --> 01:52:02,040
but you all know it's actually for, um, as, but I can see that the battle system does, it does seem

1165
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:07,160
like there's, there's more to it. So I actually, it's interesting, just not even knowing that much

1166
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:12,360
about the game, but based on like what you just said, I can like kind of see that. Yeah. And one

1167
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:17,640
of the, one of the things with it though, is that, uh, American critics kind of panned the, um, the

1168
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:25,000
battle system in it because they thought it was too complex. But I mean, I liked it. You know,

1169
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:29,720
when I played a little bit of it, you know, back on my, you know, fan translated emulation days,

1170
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:37,560
um, it, it's, it's a solid game with a solid story. Um, uh, but moving, moving forward,

1171
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:43,880
of course, um, it proved to be so popular and influential that, um, you know, and of course

1172
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:48,840
it brought in new mechanics and a new type of, of gameplay that after it was so successful,

1173
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:54,440
they did two further titles for Super Famicom. They had Romancing Saga 2 and Romancing Saga 3.

1174
01:52:54,440 --> 01:53:04,760
Um, uh, 2 came out in 93 and 3 came out in 95. And so that's the game. Um, I, I like what ACT

1175
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:12,040
DEV said, then we got Mystic Quest. Um, Mystic Quest wasn't bad. It was like RPG for very small

1176
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:16,840
children. And it had a great score. We'll give, we'll give Mystic Quest that it had good music.

1177
01:53:17,640 --> 01:53:25,160
Yeah. And, you know, I honestly, I think that the, you know, and you know, how much like the

1178
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:32,200
saga games, uh, like that came out on PlayStation go for. Oh yeah. You know, um, Saga Frontier,

1179
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:38,840
um, you know, all of those, they. Which is funny cause I rented Saga Frontier once and I hated it.

1180
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:46,760
Yeah. You know, I have, um, crap was that I had another saga game that I have in Japanese,

1181
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:55,080
honestly. And it ended up being like way too like advanced, uh, text heavy that I couldn't,

1182
01:53:55,880 --> 01:54:01,080
couldn't really do. Um, but yeah. Um, but I mean, it's just,

1183
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:09,640
it's a shame that we never got the Super Famicom. We could have had it. Um, and I think that,

1184
01:54:09,640 --> 01:54:17,560
you know, this particular game is just, you know, it, it really did something, you know, like,

1185
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:22,840
like I say, it was a square second game on the system and I think it really set off a boom in

1186
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:30,520
JRPGs on the Super Famicom. So, um, but of course, you know, for the other games in the title,

1187
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:36,360
of course, the saga games, um, came out in the US as Final Fantasy Legend, Final Fantasy Legend 2,

1188
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:40,760
and Final Fantasy Legend 3. Then there was Romancing Saga, Romancing Saga 2, Romancing

1189
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:48,040
Saga 3. Um, then there was Saga Frontier, Saga Frontier 2, and, uh, we got, uh, Unlimited Saga,

1190
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:53,880
Emperor Saga, Imperial Saga, and Saga Scarlet Grace. And there was the Legend of Legacy and the

1191
01:54:53,880 --> 01:54:58,520
Alliance Alive. So those are the things that came out with the Saga series.

1192
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:05,640
Really has its own amount of following, maybe not as much as the Final Fantasy ones, but it was

1193
01:55:05,640 --> 01:55:11,320
pretty good. All right. And now they're talking about Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. Yeah. I see

1194
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:16,200
that in chat talking about that. All right. Well, there it is your classic game of the week,

1195
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:23,080
Romancing Saga for the Super Famicom. I have to say that instead of Super Nintendo because, uh,

1196
01:55:23,080 --> 01:55:27,240
well, we never really got it. Oops, got the wrong shot there. We never really got it on the, uh,

1197
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:33,800
Super Nintendo. So, all right. Well, that is going to do it for Dark Sakura tonight because

1198
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:38,680
I know we only wrote you in for half show because you are, you are sick. So, um, please feel better.

1199
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:43,640
I mean, I haven't, you heard my voice cutting out. Yeah. We can hear it starting to go. So rest up,

1200
01:55:43,640 --> 01:55:49,240
feel better. I know all the chat, um, is, uh, sending you good vibes to heal up soon and all

1201
01:55:49,240 --> 01:55:56,440
that good stuff. I actually see me unmade for once. Yeah. I'm in my, but I have a new webcam

1202
01:55:56,440 --> 01:56:00,680
that honestly, I think it's got some problems. I mean, I didn't pay much for it, but better than

1203
01:56:00,680 --> 01:56:04,040
my old one. I think it's better than your old one. Yeah. It's a different angle tonight. It's good.

1204
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:08,440
So I'm looking for, I, but I will say when you are feeling better, I am looking forward to the

1205
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:13,720
return of the wigs. Not that your natural hair isn't beautiful, but we do. This ain't natural.

1206
01:56:13,720 --> 01:56:18,760
There's nothing natural about this color. We do love a good wig. All right. We love a wig.

1207
01:56:19,240 --> 01:56:22,760
Before I let you go to our soccer, any final thoughts or last words for our listeners tonight?

1208
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:28,840
I'm coming to your house right now for a stroke. Oh, um, I do have my thoughts. I,

1209
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:32,840
I know that there's not going to be much time by the time the podcast gets released,

1210
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:41,320
but go out and vote, do it and, um, be safe when you do it. Wear your mask. We are coming into

1211
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:50,280
the third wave of coronavirus. Um, and gen X, geeks.com, G E X. Oh, one last thing. Yeah. I

1212
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:59,000
was on the last episode of, am I mental? Oh yes. Yes. We had Eon. Their show can be about one hour.

1213
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:05,240
They have a hard cut at three. We hit the hard cut without noticing. Wow. All right. Two hours.

1214
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:11,800
Sorry. So yeah. Um, I brought a little OLR randomness. It happens. All right. Yeah.

1215
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:16,280
Go check it out. You get to hear me talk about how fucked up my brain is. I got to check that

1216
01:57:16,280 --> 01:57:20,360

1217
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:24,760
discussion. A lot of it, Rob. Yeah. I mean, I'm not tuning in to hear that. I just, you know,

1218
01:57:24,760 --> 01:57:30,040
I'm curious to hear, you know, the discussion we talked about supernatural hot too. Well,

1219
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:33,240
I can get that without just talking to you on text message. All right.

1220
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:38,040
All right. Well, Hey, my, my, my love to you guys, my love to the listeners,

1221
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:43,560
pet all the cats and harass all the children. All right. Will do. Have a good night.

1222
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:50,120
Look, you tell Nellie I owe her cookies. Bye. All right. Bye. Take care. All right. We'll do.

1223
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:56,760
All right. We'll fix up the camera shot there and we will move on to talking about some rapid

1224
01:57:56,760 --> 01:58:02,920
fire news and traveling around the industry with some quick headlines. Loki. Yes. So we've found

1225
01:58:02,920 --> 01:58:07,960
out what the new games for this month are going to be for free that your games with gold, if you

1226
01:58:07,960 --> 01:58:17,080
will, on the Xbox side of things, we have a looks like Aragami shadow edition and swim sanity.

1227
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:25,720
Those are both Xbox one and then Xbox compatible games we have looks like full spectrum warrior,

1228
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:31,800
which is actually an original Xbox game and Indiana Jones or Lego, Indiana Jones

1229
01:58:32,840 --> 01:58:40,200
or the Xbox three 60. So, uh, interesting. And then great titles with the new console coming

1230
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:45,480
out. Sorry, but they're not, but I, you know, it's so hard now because of game. Exactly.

1231
01:58:45,480 --> 01:58:51,880
It's so hard because of game pass. Like. Exactly. Like I'm not disappointed because I have game pass.

1232
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:57,240
But yeah, no, I mean, you, you do have to look at what's going on with Sony, which, you know,

1233
01:58:57,240 --> 01:59:02,680
you'll get to and it's, it's a different story. So Sony's got some more exciting stuff. So for

1234
01:59:02,680 --> 01:59:09,160
example, they have hollow Knight Boyd heart edition and middle earth shadow of war. That's on

1235
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:16,360
on PlayStation four. Um, also if you're a PlayStation five owner, you get bug snacks.

1236
01:59:17,160 --> 01:59:21,080
That's huge. Those are. Yeah. And that's going to be available for two months as well,

1237
01:59:21,080 --> 01:59:25,160
much like the other game on PlayStation five that they were offering for two months,

1238
01:59:25,160 --> 01:59:31,080
uh, next year. So this is from November 12th through January 4th. You can pick up bug snacks.

1239
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:36,440
I'm wondering since I don't own a PlayStation five, if it's one of those things where I can

1240
01:59:36,440 --> 01:59:42,280
kind of add it to my library type of thing. So I used to do that with Xbox one games back when I

1241
01:59:42,280 --> 01:59:47,880
still had a third Xbox or Sony's going to be complete dicks about it and just say, no, sorry,

1242
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:53,640
you didn't register PlayStation five of those. Uh, okay. I've got to be lucky to be fair. That's

1243
01:59:53,640 --> 01:59:57,960
not them being dicks. That's just business, you know, by a PlayStation five. It's a little,

1244
01:59:57,960 --> 02:00:02,760
it's a little bit being a dick, but no, no, no, no. It is though, because I'm paying for their

1245
02:00:02,760 --> 02:00:07,160
PlayStation plus service. So I should be entitled to the games that they're offering for free.

1246
02:00:07,160 --> 02:00:11,080
It shouldn't be a caveat that, Oh, well, I'm sorry. You got to also purchase a PlayStation

1247
02:00:11,080 --> 02:00:14,920
five right now. Cause that wasn't the way it used to be with other systems. All right. I'll give you

1248
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:18,760
that. But we don't know to me, but we don't know if we'll be able to redeem it or not yet. Yeah.

1249
02:00:18,760 --> 02:00:23,400
Anyways. But they are very explicit that it is only the PlayStation five version of bug snacks

1250
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:27,720
that we do know. You can't hit that and then get it on your PlayStation four that you can't do.

1251
02:00:27,720 --> 02:00:33,480
We know that. Yeah. So you, you will get it a PlayStation five copy in your library if you will.

1252
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:39,800
Um, so yeah, I'll go ahead and try to do that. But I like, I finally was able to redeem the

1253
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:45,240
October ones. I could not get their online site to work correctly. It would not detect that I have

1254
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:50,440
PlayStation plus, even though I very much do have PlayStation plus I have a boot up my PlayStation

1255
02:00:50,440 --> 02:00:54,920
four to actually go download them. There's a very easy new method to try that I will talk about

1256
02:00:54,920 --> 02:01:00,520
later wink. Yeah. Look at the show roll what's coming up and that's how I did it. And it's,

1257
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:07,160
it's easy. All right. And then on top of that, um, we talked about last week, how call of duty was

1258
02:01:07,160 --> 02:01:15,640
reducing the file size of modern warfare, um, to allow it to be, you know, more digestible,

1259
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:24,040
but, uh, the new call of duty black, um, cold war, uh, black ops, cold war, it's going to be

1260
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:33,640
250 gigabytes on PC, which is enormous. Oh my God. So apparently though they have a non 4k

1261
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:40,440
install, which brings it down to one 75 gigabytes or a multiplayer only client, which is only 50

1262
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:48,360
gigabytes, but Jesus says ridiculous. Wow. Hopefully the console version isn't, isn't as big

1263
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:53,640
because I mean, the day one batch, that's the whole game. We'll look at like play, look at a

1264
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:57,640
PlayStation five. I think the usable hard drive space on that. It's like only 700 megabytes. So

1265
02:01:57,640 --> 02:02:03,000
you're talking about third of the hard drive used up for one game. That's so stupid. Um,

1266
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:07,160
Bobby black Wolf and chat says, remember data caps in many areas are only 1.2 terabytes.

1267
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:10,920
So that's almost one fifth of a monthly data cap. And yeah, I'm, I'm getting to the point where

1268
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:17,240
those data caps are really getting to be a concern. We hit like 980 gigs, like within the

1269
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:24,120
past month, but it's because, um, without getting into it, like basically like somebody would leave

1270
02:02:24,120 --> 02:02:30,520
Twitch streams running and not be there watching them for a couple of hours. Um, and you know,

1271
02:02:30,520 --> 02:02:36,840
I was like, we got, but you know, I understand like, I'm sympathetic to this because how often

1272
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:42,280
have we had the TV on in the background and just had it running and it's background noise. Shit.

1273
02:02:42,280 --> 02:02:47,560
My TV came with an ambient mode that that is its purpose is to just be on in the background kind

1274
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:52,680
of running. So that's kind of like what we've kind of instilled with our motions, but now it's like,

1275
02:02:52,680 --> 02:02:58,600
Oh crap, I can't do that with a constantly downloading stream or something because

1276
02:02:58,600 --> 02:03:03,400
I might hit a bandwidth cap. Like, and that's, it's crazy that that's the thing we have to

1277
02:03:03,400 --> 02:03:08,840
worry about right now. I really hope these companies kind of evaluate that stuff. So yes,

1278
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:13,320
Bobby Blackwell says Smush needs to close his Twitch streams. Yes, he does. Yes, he does.

1279
02:03:13,960 --> 02:03:20,040
So, all right. And no one special Twitch streams. Did I, I don't think, I don't think I said the

1280
02:03:20,040 --> 02:03:26,440
other thing you're hinting at there. All right. Anyway, let's move on. Um, so, uh, let's talk

1281
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:30,760
about N7 Day cause that's going to be this week. And of course, if you're a fan of Mass Effect,

1282
02:03:30,760 --> 02:03:37,320
then you know that November 7th or N7 is kind of a big deal. Um, and you know, N7 Day never went

1283
02:03:37,320 --> 02:03:41,880
away. It's always kind of an annual celebration of Mass Effect, although I feel like they do some

1284
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:48,040
bigger things one years than others, but, uh, what's happening, uh, Marc Meer actually said,

1285
02:03:48,040 --> 02:03:53,640
uh, over the weekend that he's going to be doing a, or joining an N7 Day stream that's taking place

1286
02:03:53,640 --> 02:04:00,120
on November 7th at 11 AM Pacific. And it's not just going to be him. Jennifer Hale will be there

1287
02:04:00,120 --> 02:04:05,640
too. So if you're male Shep or female Shep, guess what? They will both be there. And the voice actors

1288
02:04:05,640 --> 02:04:13,960
for Caden, Liara, Jack, Grunt, Ashley, Samantha trainer, Morden and Legion are all going to be

1289
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:20,360
there. Now, something interesting I noticed about that list. It's all characters from the original

1290
02:04:20,360 --> 02:04:26,440
trilogy and none from Andromeda. Now, I said I wasn't going to talk about that game until

1291
02:04:26,440 --> 02:04:33,720
they officially announce it, but if I were going to finally, finally fucking announce that game,

1292
02:04:34,520 --> 02:04:37,800
this might be the group of people I want to get together on a Zoom call to do it.

1293
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:42,680
Probably. Didn't we have it rumored that it was supposed to be still coming out like, uh,

1294
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:49,320
like trademarks or something or, uh, ESRV ratings? You know what, Loki? I'm not going to talk about

1295
02:04:49,320 --> 02:04:57,640
it. You know, sorry. You know how I feel. It'll happen when it happens. But I,

1296
02:04:59,480 --> 02:05:03,960
let me just put it this way. If they don't say anything at this November 7th thing,

1297
02:05:04,600 --> 02:05:10,280
then like, I am so done. I am so, I can't even. Wouldn't it make more sense for those remakes to

1298
02:05:10,280 --> 02:05:14,840
come out on the brand new systems that they're releasing just now versus like the current

1299
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:19,080
systems? Wouldn't you think that that might be why they're waiting a little bit? And I'd

1300
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:24,600
be okay with that. And that Loki, that's a very logical answer. Um, and I am all about that

1301
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:32,600
answer if that is the case. Yes. We'll see. All right. Anyhow. Uh, other, one other story here.

1302
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:38,440
Oh yes. Wizardry. I don't know if y'all know about the wizardry series, but this, this goes way back

1303
02:05:38,440 --> 02:05:43,720
in gaming's history, right? The classic classic games wizardry. Um, well, a Japanese company

1304
02:05:43,720 --> 02:05:50,520
named DRECOM has just picked up the copyright domestic foreign trademark rights to wizardry.

1305
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:55,720
And that means they now have the copyrights to wizardry six, seven and eight and wizardry gold.

1306
02:05:55,720 --> 02:06:01,320
And they basically have the trademark over that name. This company is saying they will, uh, keep

1307
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:05,320
their commitment to the acquisition of popular intellectual properties and the development and

1308
02:06:05,320 --> 02:06:12,200
cultivation of the internal properties. Here's the downside. DRECOM is a mobile game developer

1309
02:06:12,280 --> 02:06:17,400
and they're based out of Tokyo. Uh, now they've worked on cool stuff like Disgaea, RPG,

1310
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:23,640
everybody's golf, the mobile version. So, you know, there's the, it's not all bad news. Um,

1311
02:06:23,640 --> 02:06:29,080
but that's where the wizardry stuff is right now. So maybe, maybe Loki, they'll make something that

1312
02:06:29,080 --> 02:06:37,880
will be for Facebook gaming cloud service. Oh, check out that wizardry I'm showing. All right.

1313
02:06:38,520 --> 02:06:43,000
That's it for rapid fire news. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates. I

1314
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:46,680
know we're getting into that time of year where there's going to be a lot, right? Loki.

1315
02:06:47,400 --> 02:06:52,520
Um, not so much this week because they're saving it all for next week. Um, this week we've got,

1316
02:06:52,520 --> 02:06:59,240
uh, Bakugan champions of Astoria that's on Nintendo switch, uh, Jurassic world evolution

1321
02:07:24,680 --> 02:07:29,480
tropical six on Nintendo switch. That's it. All right. Well, Japan has, uh, quite a few

1322
02:07:29,480 --> 02:07:33,640
releases this week compared to other weeks on the Nintendo switch this week. Uh, we have

1323
02:07:33,640 --> 02:07:39,960
alpaca ball all stars is out this week. And I'm wondering if, I'm wondering if that is actually

1324
02:07:39,960 --> 02:07:48,920
some type of game that stars alpacas that you actually like. Oh my God, it is fabulous. I am

1325
02:07:48,920 --> 02:07:54,520
all about that. Uh, and it looks like that game's coming out in Europe as well at some point. So

1326
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:58,600
I'm sure we'll get it here. We'll see. Um, other games coming out in Japan, construction simulator

1329
02:08:11,320 --> 02:08:16,520
shadow verse champions battle and a game called Mary Skelter finale. And I was like,

1330
02:08:16,520 --> 02:08:21,080
what the hell is this game? Check out this description. You ready? Mary Skelter finale

1331
02:08:21,080 --> 02:08:26,280
is the latest series that depicts the end of jailbreak drama that revealed through Mary

1332
02:08:26,280 --> 02:08:30,120
Skelter nightmares, Mary Skelter two and the Mary Skelter short stories.

1333
02:08:30,120 --> 02:08:35,000
The protagonist who is trapped in jail with a living prison full of strings,

1334
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:41,960
monsters called Martians aims to escape with the help of blood maidens who possess a special power

1335
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:46,520
and judging from the special art book, the blood maidens are sexy maidens.

1336
02:08:47,480 --> 02:08:53,800
So, I mean, aren't they all, I would hope so. All right. Happy Halloween. A little late. Anyway,

1337
02:08:53,800 --> 02:08:59,400
on the PlayStation four that Mary Skelter finale games also out there, as well as ACE combat seven,

1338
02:08:59,400 --> 02:09:03,480
getting a price reduction and, uh, that's it. So it's a little more exciting on the switch this

1339
02:09:03,480 --> 02:09:09,560
week. Um, how about the UK Loki since, uh, dark soccer took off. So yeah, in the UK, we've got,

in chat. And so, uh, we have SSJ, I'm sorry. Act Def says, um, president cat and vice president

1353
02:10:45,240 --> 02:10:50,280
alpaca, um, better than the current administration and just saying, uh, how, sorry, I'm not supposed

1354
02:10:50,280 --> 02:10:55,160
to talk about politics. Damn it. Uh, but active. I love the fact checking that happens on the show

1355
02:10:55,160 --> 02:11:01,880
where our chat goes the extra mile at depth in chat says, uh, or gave a link alpaca ball

1356
02:11:01,880 --> 02:11:08,440
all stars is on steam right now. So you don't have to be in Japan to play alpaca ball unless

1357
02:11:08,440 --> 02:11:12,760
you want to play it on switch, I guess, uh, in Japan. Uh, but you can get it on steam right now.

1358
02:11:12,760 --> 02:11:17,080
And, uh, active to say it is, it is what you think it's alpacas playing soccer best game ever.

1359
02:11:18,200 --> 02:11:23,160
I mean, what, what more do you need? I like, I like a game. That's honest. You know,

1360
02:11:23,560 --> 02:11:29,720
I don't like a game where the title doesn't make sense and it's vague. And what does it mean?

1361
02:11:30,280 --> 02:11:35,480
I'd like a game that just puts it all on the table. You know, this is what it is.

1362
02:11:35,480 --> 02:11:43,080
Take it or leave it. All right. This is an alpaca and it's playing soccer. Exactly.

1363
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:49,400
Uh, vidpower 573 in chat says alpaca ball goes great with goat of duty.

1364
02:11:50,040 --> 02:11:56,920
What about goat simulator? All right. Go to duty is a little different. It's more of just,

1365
02:11:56,920 --> 02:12:02,280
it was kind of, uh, joking off of goat simulator and then, um, call it duty. So

1366
02:12:04,200 --> 02:12:09,080
I don't know. It was free for a while ago. That's just J 100. Matt says if 2020 continues to go

1367
02:12:09,080 --> 02:12:16,680
south, at least we have this. That's right. 2020 the year of COVID pandemic and well,

1368
02:12:16,680 --> 02:12:23,880
Hey, at least there was a packable moving on. You guys are killing me. Moving on. Let's get

1369
02:12:23,880 --> 02:12:30,360
to the next story. Uh, Oh, everyone's talking about this, right? Logan. Yeah. So, uh, fortunately

1370
02:12:30,360 --> 02:12:37,880
we, we got the news and even though games have gone gold, like cyberpunk 2077, apparently going

1371
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:42,680
gold does not mean that it's still not going to be delayed again. And that's what happened. So,

1372
02:12:43,560 --> 02:12:50,440
they had put out a message on Twitter saying that, you know, we were sorry, but unfortunately we need

1373
02:12:50,440 --> 02:12:55,640
additional time to work on that. That ominous black text on a yellow background. That's starting

1374
02:12:55,640 --> 02:13:01,160
to look like the fucking BBC breaking news alert logo. Like when you, when you see it pop up on

1375
02:13:01,160 --> 02:13:09,880
your Twitter feed, you're like, Oh, what now? Right. It's currently been delayed to December

1376
02:13:09,880 --> 02:13:16,760
7th or I'm sorry, December 10th. I say currently, because I have a feeling that's going to be

1377
02:13:16,760 --> 02:13:28,520
delayed again. And if you want to believe anonymous posts on Twitter, then according to an anonymous

1378
02:13:28,520 --> 02:13:35,240
insider that works at CG product, read about four to five months worth of time to work on the game.

1379
02:13:35,320 --> 02:13:42,440
So whatever at this point, like I, I don't, so they're working on the day one patch stuff

1380
02:13:42,440 --> 02:13:49,560
right now. Obviously I don't see how it gets delayed that much because the game went gold,

1381
02:13:49,560 --> 02:13:56,920
right? And they're already pressing the disks, right? So three weeks to make a patch that fixes

1382
02:13:56,920 --> 02:14:01,720
some pretty major issues, I guess makes sense, even though technically there's going to be

1383
02:14:01,720 --> 02:14:05,160
people who can't download that patch right away. So that disc needs to be able to like,

1384
02:14:05,160 --> 02:14:10,760
kind of play the game, but delaying it all the way to March for a day one patch, that just seems

1385
02:14:10,760 --> 02:14:15,960
a little, I don't know. But again, you, you, you said the source, so take it or leave it is a

1386
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:22,680
forum post. So, you know, take it or leave it. That would just be very surprising. That's all

1387
02:14:22,680 --> 02:14:27,400
I'm going to say. And look, I've heard all that. I get it. I get it. And I usually game delays are

1388
02:14:27,400 --> 02:14:32,280
fine because I get it. A good game is a bad game is a bad game forever. Blah, blah, blah. Said

1389
02:14:32,280 --> 02:14:37,320
Miyamoto. Nobody will remember the delay, which or three was delayed a ton of times. Who cares

1390
02:14:37,320 --> 02:14:41,320
at this point? Yes, yes, yes. I get it. And I support all of that. And yes, if the game

1391
02:14:41,320 --> 02:14:47,480
isn't ready, then fucking delay it. I get it. However, the sheer number of times it's had to

1392
02:14:47,480 --> 02:14:53,080
be delayed. And then on top of that, a three week delay, like a little baby step delay.

1393
02:14:53,080 --> 02:14:57,320
There's something about those little, like, you know, bumblebee looking announcements on

1394
02:14:57,320 --> 02:15:02,040
the cyberpunk Twitter that are just starting to become self parody in a way. You know what I mean?

1395
02:15:02,040 --> 02:15:07,000
It's like, and they are, in fact, a bunch of people were parodying to make all sorts of

1396
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:11,640
announcements. Where is your project management? Like, how have you guys missed the day so many

1397
02:15:11,640 --> 02:15:19,640
times? Well, I'm okay. You know what? Pandemic. Everybody's working from home. Not everybody was

1398
02:15:19,640 --> 02:15:26,200
prepared for that. I do get it. But you know, you just can't help. But that was the September to

1399
02:15:26,200 --> 02:15:31,800
November delay. So what about the rest of the time? You can't help, but just feels a little

1400
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:38,520
bit of like, Oh my God, what is what is going on over there? But hey, look, if the game comes out,

1401
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:42,360
and it kicks all sort of asses every, you know, everybody's setting the bar pretty fucking high

1402
02:15:42,360 --> 02:15:47,400
for this game. So I mean, that's that act. I see that as a problem in some ways. Maybe the delays

1403
02:15:47,400 --> 02:15:51,400
are to help lower the bar. I don't know. But people are setting the bar pretty fucking high

1404
02:15:51,400 --> 02:15:57,000
for this game. So hopefully it delivers. And you know, people, you're right, like The Witcher 3,

1405
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:00,920
nobody's gonna care about the delay at the end of the day. But, and I brought this up on Bobby's

1406
02:16:00,920 --> 02:16:05,000
show before we went live tonight, one interesting thing about even a three week delay is that now

1407
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:09,400
this game is no longer going to be eligible for the Game Awards this year. Because Game Awards

1408
02:16:09,400 --> 02:16:13,640
eligibility, if I remember right, based on last year, runs through the last week in November. It

1409
02:16:13,640 --> 02:16:18,520
may not be exactly November 30. But it's around that like, black, sorry, something just fell over

1410
02:16:18,520 --> 02:16:23,720
in studio. It's around that Black Friday timeline. So by bumping into December, they're gonna miss

1411
02:16:23,720 --> 02:16:29,240
it. So now it's not going to be eligible for Game of the Year. And it's gonna have to be one of

1412
02:16:29,240 --> 02:16:35,320
those games that you kind of remember deep into 2021 against whatever else comes out next year.

1413
02:16:35,320 --> 02:16:42,600
And you know, you might have some big, you know, like, Horizon Forbidden West, or maybe even the

1414
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:46,920
Ragnarok game are going to be out on PlayStation 5. Microsoft will finally get Halo out and

1415
02:16:46,920 --> 02:16:50,200
whatever other big titles they have, you know, there's gonna be some pretty whopper titles next

1416
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:55,240
year. So Cyberpunk is gonna have to compete against all that as opposed to this year where

1417
02:16:56,280 --> 02:17:00,920
Nintendo isn't putting out a lot this holiday. Animal Crossing is likely to be a Game of the

1418
02:17:00,920 --> 02:17:04,760
Year nominee just because of what it, you know, kind of represents with the pandemic and everything.

1419
02:17:04,760 --> 02:17:10,600
And Final Fantasy 7 Remake will probably get a nomination. And I'm not saying, I think Hades

1420
02:17:10,600 --> 02:17:14,120
really stands a shot at getting a nomination. At least I hope it does. It does in my heart.

1421
02:17:14,680 --> 02:17:20,280
But I feel like this is like an, and it's not what the quality of games this year has been bad.

1422
02:17:20,280 --> 02:17:26,600
But I think just by nature, because it has been in a technological sense, the lame duck year before

1423
02:17:26,600 --> 02:17:30,680
the new consoles, and then the pandemic on top of that, I mean, look at the pandemic did in the

1424
02:17:30,680 --> 02:17:35,800
movie industry, right? Like the Oscars next year. Like, what are the Oscars gonna look like next

1425
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:40,920
year? They're combining like, isn't it like 15 months of movies or something? It's gonna be weird.

1426
02:17:42,920 --> 02:17:50,920
So, it's gonna be interesting to see what that does to award season and so forth and what game

1427
02:17:50,920 --> 02:17:58,120
actually does win the game awards. So, SSG100Matt in chat says, I'm fine with the delay. All kidding

1428
02:17:58,120 --> 02:18:02,120
aside, I personally don't have the time to play right now. I just moved and I don't even have a

1429
02:18:02,120 --> 02:18:09,960
console set up. Do you think, Loki, if they were to do a bigger delay into March, and that's a big

1430
02:18:09,960 --> 02:18:14,920
if, okay? I'm gonna play the tin foil hat game just because we have the time to do that on a

1431
02:18:14,920 --> 02:18:20,760
three-hour show. To play the tin foil hat game, if they do bump it to March, you had just mentioned

1432
02:18:20,760 --> 02:18:25,160
about Mass Effect. Wouldn't you rather they delay it to make it even better on the new systems?

1433
02:18:25,160 --> 02:18:32,040
Do you think bumping it to March may be because they're going to jazz it up, zhuzh it up for the

1434
02:18:32,040 --> 02:18:35,720
new systems even more than they'd planned? They were already gonna do that, though. They were

1435
02:18:35,720 --> 02:18:42,120
already delaying the next-gen versions until March, so they were already planning. Isn't that the problem?

1436
02:18:42,920 --> 02:18:48,120
Didn't they say that in their last release? They have, yeah, but they have nine versions to work on

1437
02:18:48,120 --> 02:18:53,080
excluding the two next-gen versions. They have the versions, basically, so they have the, you know,

1438
02:18:53,080 --> 02:19:00,760
PlayStation 4, PC. They have, you know, the PlayStation 4 Pro, PlayStation 5 backwards

1439
02:19:00,760 --> 02:19:07,400
compatibility, Xbox One, Xbox Series X backwards compatibility, Xbox Series S backwards

1440
02:19:07,400 --> 02:19:14,440
compatibility. I'm not sure what all the other ones were, but it's a lot of stuff that they have

1441
02:19:14,440 --> 02:19:18,680
to test to see if it's going to be working correctly, and

1442
02:19:21,080 --> 02:19:25,560
I don't know. That's excluding the other versions, though. Oh, and I'm sorry, Stadia.

1443
02:19:25,560 --> 02:19:33,640
How could I forget Stadia? Well, it's easy. Facebook Gaming. I don't see Facebook Gaming on there,

1444
02:19:34,200 --> 02:19:39,880
so that's a plus. Clearly, it's not a real game. All right, let's move on. Loki, I mentioned earlier

1445
02:19:39,880 --> 02:19:44,440
in the show about another way to get your PlayStation Plus games, and that is through

1446
02:19:44,440 --> 02:19:51,000
the brand new PlayStation app. So, Sony actually updated the PlayStation app, which is to match

1447
02:19:51,560 --> 02:19:58,360
the re-look of the PlayStation 5 and so forth, and so far, the new app seems to be doing better than

1448
02:19:58,360 --> 02:20:02,040
the new store did when we were talking about that last week, where it was like, where is the title

1449
02:20:02,040 --> 02:20:05,640
of the games? But I will say, if you check out, are you looking down right now because you're

1450
02:20:05,640 --> 02:20:09,880
downloading the app? I'm looking at my PlayStation. I already have a PlayStation app.

1451
02:20:11,400 --> 02:20:14,840
Look, I have to look at my phone during the show sometimes, too. That's too funny a time

1452
02:20:14,840 --> 02:20:20,040
that I'm talking about that, and suddenly you're looking down. Well, I want to see if it looks

1453
02:20:20,040 --> 02:20:24,440
right. And see if you can redeem your PlayStation Plus game and see if it's a little easier. Oh,

1454
02:20:24,440 --> 02:20:30,440
wait, you already did. I already did, yeah. All right. Well, anyway, so you can go into that,

1455
02:20:30,440 --> 02:20:35,000
and what's neat about it is that you'll be able to actually manage your PlayStation 5

1456
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:42,120
storage through the app as well, which I believe Xbox Game Pass app allows you to do that a little

1457
02:20:42,120 --> 02:20:48,360
bit, too. So it's nice that Sony is joining that, too, where you can kind of mobile manage it,

1458
02:20:48,360 --> 02:20:51,800
especially when you're talking about downloading big games. And I think that's why it's important

1459
02:20:51,800 --> 02:20:55,960
to be able to connect to your system and kind of manage some of the big, big, especially if you got

1460
02:20:55,960 --> 02:21:03,720
like 250 gigs filled up by Go to Duty or whatever, then you got to delete some stuff to make room

1461
02:21:03,720 --> 02:21:10,200
sometimes. So anyway, the app was updated this last week. It was updated on iOS and Android.

1462
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:14,120
There's now a home screen, and you have friends on there and recently played games. The app used

1463
02:21:14,120 --> 02:21:19,880
to be split. There was a messaging app, and thank God somebody figured out that was a terrible idea,

1464
02:21:19,880 --> 02:21:23,480
and they homogenized that into the one app. So if you have the standalone messaging app,

1465
02:21:23,480 --> 02:21:28,280
you can get rid of it. The main app will show you your friends list, let you chat with those people.

1466
02:21:28,360 --> 02:21:36,200
Messages is in there as well. And that's pretty cool. You can also, through the app, voice chat

1467
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:40,520
with friends on their PlayStation. So that's something they're kind of bridging the gap with

1468
02:21:40,520 --> 02:21:45,080
as well. Whereas like, you know, on Nintendo, the only voice chat is through the app. And I don't

1469
02:21:45,080 --> 02:21:51,400
think Microsoft really has that right now, where you can chat through the app with people in the

1470
02:21:51,400 --> 02:21:56,040
game. It could be wrong. Good, because it's a terrible idea, unless you're not like playing

1471
02:21:56,040 --> 02:22:00,840
with people and you just want to chat with some random person that has a PlayStation account,

1472
02:22:00,840 --> 02:22:04,600
but they're not playing games. You could just like call them on the phone,

1473
02:22:05,720 --> 02:22:13,880
or FaceTime or whatever. Use my phone for phone things? No. Or, you know, Discord's the thing,

1474
02:22:13,880 --> 02:22:19,240
I guess. Yeah. Discord's the big one now too. That's a lot. Like, you know, I play games with

1475
02:22:19,240 --> 02:22:24,360
people. We just hang on Discord. So there's been nights where like, I'm playing something,

1476
02:22:24,360 --> 02:22:27,400
my friend's playing something else, and we're still just chatting on Discord. You know,

1477
02:22:27,400 --> 02:22:34,120
whatever. So anyway. Also, the store. You know, the store is integrated into the app,

1478
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:37,560
because that's the real money maker. So because the app doesn't cost you anything,

1479
02:22:37,560 --> 02:22:41,160
but if you want to buy stuff through the store, that will do it. But you can also, again,

1480
02:22:41,160 --> 02:22:45,400
manage that remotely. So that's pretty cool. I'm glad to hear the app is getting an update.

1481
02:22:45,400 --> 02:22:49,400
I'm very glad to hear it's not two separate apps anymore. And again, I went in there and

1482
02:22:49,400 --> 02:22:53,880
used the app a little bit and it was good. I was able to redeem my game. So try that next month,

1483
02:22:53,880 --> 02:22:58,600
Loki. I will try that next month since their website sucks. All right. So bad. Maybe they'll

1484
02:22:58,600 --> 02:23:03,400
fix the website by next month, but we'll see. All right. I got another story for you guys,

1485
02:23:03,400 --> 02:23:08,760
and it's about Netflix. I know a lot of you guys are, you know, streaming and watching all that.

1486
02:23:08,760 --> 02:23:14,280
And we know that there's a lot of video game related projects in the works at Netflix right

1487
02:23:14,280 --> 02:23:20,920
now. But let me take a moment to tell you just how many there are. There are 10 different projects

1488
02:23:20,920 --> 02:23:28,440
in the works right now at Netflix. And this list doesn't even have The Witcher, apparently. The

1489
02:23:28,440 --> 02:23:33,640
Witcher Blood Origin, I guess, is the new... I'm sorry. The Witcher Blood Origin is the prequel

1490
02:23:33,640 --> 02:23:39,640
series. So that is on the list. But The Witcher season two is not on this list I'm about to read

1491
02:23:39,640 --> 02:23:43,800
here. So there's two Witcher shows right now. Although yes, if you want to get technical,

1492
02:23:43,800 --> 02:23:49,400
The Witcher is based on a book. But we all know the game helped and the game set our expectations

1493
02:23:49,400 --> 02:23:55,320
of what the show would actually look like. What else is in the works? Resident Evil,

1494
02:23:55,320 --> 02:24:01,400
a live action series. Resident Evil Infinite Darkness, a animated series. Assassin's Creed,

1495
02:24:01,400 --> 02:24:08,680
a live series. Cyberpunk Edgerunners, an animated series. Splinter Cell, an animated series. The

1496
02:24:08,680 --> 02:24:16,840
Division, a live movie. Devil May Cry, an animated series. Final Fantasy, a live series. I keep

1497
02:24:16,840 --> 02:24:21,800
forgetting that is in development. It's actually... This list doesn't say it's Final Fantasy 14,

1498
02:24:21,800 --> 02:24:25,880
but it is. Not something because it's the same people that did The Witcher that are working on

1499
02:24:25,880 --> 02:24:31,720
it. And The Cuphead Show, an animated series. All of that being worked on right now. And

1500
02:24:31,720 --> 02:24:36,760
Castlevania is getting a fourth season. Dragon's Dogma just came out within this last month,

1501
02:24:36,760 --> 02:24:42,280
that animated series. So Netflix is like the home of video game adaptations right now. It's

1502
02:24:42,280 --> 02:24:51,320
pretty crazy. But that's good. What do you think about all these video game projects on... This

1503
02:24:51,320 --> 02:24:55,800
doesn't even count what's already out there, like the Ingress anime, although I doubt they're doing

1504
02:24:55,800 --> 02:24:59,800
another season of that. Or some of the other stuff that's out there. It's just kind of neat.

1505
02:25:01,880 --> 02:25:05,800
I probably won't get around to watching it. I still haven't watched any of The Witcher or

1506
02:25:06,440 --> 02:25:11,240
Castlevania, even though I hear those are really good. I did, unfortunately,

1507
02:25:11,240 --> 02:25:19,000
try watching the Ingress anime and that was not very good. I don't know. Maybe I'll check out

1508
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:27,800
one of them. Maybe the live action Final Fantasy 14 would be interesting. We'll see. I have to run

1509
02:25:27,800 --> 02:25:34,600
out of things to watch. Questbuster in chat says, the Dragon's Dogma one isn't bad. So there's that.

1510
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:40,520
SG100Matt says, hope they all don't suck. All right. I think they're pretty good so far. I

1511
02:25:40,520 --> 02:25:45,960
don't think that there's a lot that have been really terrible. The only thing that makes

1512
02:25:45,960 --> 02:25:51,560
Ingress the anime bad is the same thing that makes Ingress bad. And that's the storyline's

1513
02:25:51,560 --> 02:25:55,800
too convoluted and doesn't make any sense. Who plays for the story?

1514
02:25:56,600 --> 02:26:00,760
I will cry. I understand that. But why make an anime if the story is not compelling?

1515
02:26:01,720 --> 02:26:08,760
I don't know. It's just not very good. But that's the fault of the source material. Not so much

1516
02:26:08,760 --> 02:26:15,960
that the people aren't talented enough to make it into a series. All right. Well, let's move on.

1517
02:26:16,520 --> 02:26:19,400
Loki, we have a couple more stories before we get to the listener roundtable. Loki.

1518
02:26:20,520 --> 02:26:24,360
People need to leave Sakurai alone. I mean, he's just a perfectionist. A little too much

1519
02:26:24,360 --> 02:26:31,960
of a perfectionist, though, because his original scope for the adding Steve and the Minecraft

1520
02:26:31,960 --> 02:26:38,200
characters to Smash Ultimate was he wanted to allow players to create their own Minecraft

1521
02:26:38,200 --> 02:26:43,480
levels and be able to import them into Smash. That's crazy. Obviously. Obviously, that was not

1522
02:26:44,360 --> 02:26:49,640
something that was implemented. Welcome to my Minecraft level dungeon of dicks.

1523
02:26:49,640 --> 02:26:53,080
Because you know, that's what they would have done.

1524
02:26:54,120 --> 02:26:59,160
It was too difficult in development to get it working. And so he just didn't end up having

1525
02:26:59,160 --> 02:27:06,920
something, you know, like that implemented. But. I mean, it's fine that Sakurai opted to take a nap

1526
02:27:07,800 --> 02:27:11,400
and he earned it, so leave him alone. Like, I could do all this extra stuff

1527
02:27:11,400 --> 02:27:15,400
or it could take a nap and nap is probably a better thing. Honestly,

1528
02:27:15,400 --> 02:27:17,640
he earned it. Don't give him shit. I will fight you.

1529
02:27:20,600 --> 02:27:24,760
All right. So can you imagine what that would have looked like if actual Minecraft was?

1530
02:27:24,760 --> 02:27:27,320
I think that was just a bad idea to begin with, because, you know,

1531
02:27:27,320 --> 02:27:33,160
people are going to do Booby Stadium, Dungeon of Dicks, you name it, somebody's going to do it.

1532
02:27:33,160 --> 02:27:38,920
So it's probably for the best that they didn't, you know, didn't do it. All right.

1533
02:27:38,920 --> 02:27:44,920
Yeah. Moving on. This is a this is a nice one to end the show on a little bit. We still have

1534
02:27:44,920 --> 02:27:51,080
Listener Roundtable coming up. But for our last news story here, the PlayStation 2 is celebrating

1535
02:27:51,080 --> 02:27:57,880
an anniversary. That's right. The PlayStation 2 is 20 years old this week. The PlayStation 2

1536
02:27:57,880 --> 02:28:02,840
came out 20 years ago in North America. So I know some of you want to get technical with the

1537
02:28:02,840 --> 02:28:07,560
Japanese release and all that good stuff. But obviously, a lot of people looking back fondly

1538
02:28:07,560 --> 02:28:12,280
on the PlayStation 2 as one of the greatest consoles of all time. You know, yes, even

1539
02:28:12,280 --> 02:28:17,240
counting Super Nintendo and Dreamcast and all your other faves. You know, PlayStation 2 brought

1540
02:28:17,240 --> 02:28:21,800
us a lot of huge series when we talk about things like God of War, you know, just how Metal Gear

1541
02:28:21,800 --> 02:28:25,640
Solid, although, yes, the original was on the PlayStation, the sequels really upped the game

1542
02:28:26,440 --> 02:28:32,520
and so on. Like, was there a game that just really defined the PlayStation 2 for you, Loki?

1543
02:28:32,520 --> 02:28:45,400
I mean, a lot of like Grand Theft Auto 3 and 4, or I'm sorry, 3 and Vice City, San Andreas.

1544
02:28:45,400 --> 02:28:50,600
I mean, those are pretty big. Dance Dance Revolution, a lot of the games we played on there.

1545
02:28:50,600 --> 02:28:56,520
Honestly, BeatMania 2DX, even though that was in Japan. Like for me, those games really defined

1546
02:28:56,520 --> 02:29:01,560
that era and like why I had a Japanese PlayStation 2 before I had an American one because of that.

1547
02:29:01,560 --> 02:29:07,720
A lot of like the early stuff I want to say, because, you know, back the PlayStation was also,

1548
02:29:08,680 --> 02:29:15,560
well, I didn't have Final Fantasy XI on it, but I did have the HD loader, so that was fun,

1549
02:29:15,560 --> 02:29:20,840
you know, loading games on with that. Oh, yes. Here's some answers from chat. Bobby Blackwolf

1550
02:29:20,840 --> 02:29:28,920
says Kadamari Damacy. W04 says all the Clover Studio games were mint. Vidpower says PlayStation

1551
02:29:28,920 --> 02:29:35,960
2 was a great console and a great DVD player. That's very true. That is why that thing sold

1552
02:29:35,960 --> 02:29:41,640
buku bananas because, you know, putting the DVD stuff in there was a great idea. Sacred Jade says

1553
02:29:41,640 --> 02:29:51,400
Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance and Deception. So, yes. And Magic Pen Gel from me. That was a

1554
02:29:51,400 --> 02:29:56,680
PlayStation 2 all time great. Although, you know, I've always been a sucker for Final Fantasy games.

1555
02:29:56,680 --> 02:30:03,240
So, I mean, Final Fantasy X was huge. XII was great. And, of course, XI online. PlayStation 2,

1556
02:30:03,240 --> 02:30:07,880
that game was made for PlayStation 2, really. The PC was kind of secondary. By the time we got it

1557
02:30:07,880 --> 02:30:12,120
in the US, we got it with the first expansion. That game was really made for the PlayStation 2

1558
02:30:12,120 --> 02:30:17,560
in Japan. So, that's a big one too. Some other music games coming in from Bobby saying Mad

1559
02:30:17,560 --> 02:30:23,880
Maestro and Guitar Man. So, yeah. Good answers, guys. Good answers. So, looking back on the

1560
02:30:23,880 --> 02:30:30,760
PlayStation 2 and yes, you're old because the PlayStation 2 just turned 20. Now, how old are

1561
02:30:30,760 --> 02:30:37,000
you? How old were you when you got a PlayStation 2? Add 20 to it. All right. You're welcome.

1562
02:30:37,880 --> 02:30:45,080
Let's move on to the listener roundtable. If you have questions in chat or comments or think

1563
02:30:45,080 --> 02:30:49,400
probably going to be cursing me out after what I just said. But things you want to talk about here

1564
02:30:49,400 --> 02:30:53,640
on air, please, by all means, leave those questions and comments in chat. I'll get to as many of those

1565
02:30:53,640 --> 02:30:59,960
as I can. But as part of the roundtable, I also want to get to the mailbag. So, let's get to the

1566
02:30:59,960 --> 02:31:05,720
mailbag tonight. And we do have a couple of emails tonight here. And first, I want to mention this

1567
02:31:05,720 --> 02:31:11,720
because Bobby can't resist a cheap plug here. But it's a good plug and I will allow it. Saying,

1568
02:31:11,720 --> 02:31:17,320
thing you're looking forward to in Awesome Games Done Quick, where do we mention on last week's

1569
02:31:17,320 --> 02:31:22,120
show? I thought we did. If we didn't, then I'll say it. Bobby is going to be a full host for the

1570
02:31:22,120 --> 02:31:29,640
next one. He was a pinch hitter host on the Summer Games event. And he did one hosting stint on the

1571
02:31:29,640 --> 02:31:35,240
Devil May Cry 4 speed run. But he's going to get a full shift this time. He's going to be doing

1572
02:31:35,240 --> 02:31:41,240
multiple games for Awesome Games. That's great. Congrats, Bobby. And yes, I did look at the list

1573
02:31:41,240 --> 02:31:45,800
earlier this week. And the thing that caught my eye that I hope Bobby gets to voice, although I'm

1574
02:31:45,800 --> 02:31:52,360
sure lots of people will be wanting to do it, is the Beat Saber Showcase in VR. Even though I know

1575
02:31:52,360 --> 02:31:59,480
Bobby doesn't like those super crazy hard levels, but I think if somebody else is doing it and is

1576
02:31:59,480 --> 02:32:05,080
doing it very well, it'll be an awesome thing to kind of look at, watch and talk about. So, for me,

1577
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:09,000
that Beat Saber expert thing definitely caught my eye. And I hope they don't put that three o'clock

1578
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:13,640
in the morning my time. I hope it is a primetime event that I'll be able to watch. I also think it's

1579
02:32:13,640 --> 02:32:17,880
interesting they have things like BPM, Bullets Per Minute, where that's like a very recent game.

1580
02:32:17,880 --> 02:32:23,400
Although, I mean, the game's done quick event, they put out new games are in it all the time.

1581
02:32:23,400 --> 02:32:27,560
So that's pretty cool. I don't know if you got a chance to look at the list, Loki, but is there

1582
02:32:27,560 --> 02:32:31,960
any speed run you're looking forward to? I'm looking at it right now. The Diablo 3 one caught

1583
02:32:31,960 --> 02:32:38,600
my eye too, because Diablo 3 is very random in many ways. Like the maps can be very random. So

1584
02:32:38,600 --> 02:32:45,880
I'm kind of curious about the speed run strategy. I imagine there's certain ways you can kind of

1585
02:32:45,880 --> 02:32:54,040
tell the seed and things like that. So I'm curious to how that'll work. Yeah, I don't know if there's

1586
02:32:54,040 --> 02:33:00,120
anything like I'm super hyped to see. I was hoping they'd have another Minecraft run, but they have

1587
02:33:00,120 --> 02:33:04,360
Minecraft Dungeons, which would be interesting. So I'll check that out. I like Minecraft Dungeons.

1588
02:33:04,920 --> 02:33:09,240
It's like an old school Diablo. Yeah, so that'd be interesting to see.

1589
02:33:12,840 --> 02:33:20,120
Yeah, I don't know. Does anyone run the Burger King games? Because I would really like to see

1590
02:33:20,120 --> 02:33:25,320
that. Loki, you're going to be the first. You need to work on that. No, I don't have them anymore. I

1591
02:33:25,320 --> 02:33:30,520
only have a Pocket Bike Racing, and that was literally the worst one of the bunch. I think I

1592
02:33:30,520 --> 02:33:36,040
have a copy of Sneak King still, and it should be backwards compatible. I don't know. I've never

1593
02:33:36,040 --> 02:33:42,760
tried. It should be, you know, because they have both the Xbox and Xbox 360 versions on the same

1594
02:33:42,760 --> 02:33:47,960
disk. Loki, Loki, hell with your game. To hell with your game. You need to be the world speed

1595
02:33:47,960 --> 02:33:53,000
run champion of Sneak King. No, I don't want to do that. It was funny though. Actually, I like

1596
02:33:53,000 --> 02:34:00,120
somebody I follow who's a game developer. This guy named Danny who streams a lot on, or he does a lot

1597
02:34:00,120 --> 02:34:06,440
of YouTube stuff, and he's actually been dedicating himself to try to become a Minecraft speedrunner.

1598
02:34:06,440 --> 02:34:10,520
I was like, yeah, you know, he could do it. I probably could do it too. I just still, so the

1599
02:34:10,520 --> 02:34:16,360
problem is I don't use mousey keyboard a lot for anything PC, so I'm already at a disadvantage

1600
02:34:16,360 --> 02:34:22,520
because I never was really kind of, I'm not used to using the mouse and keyboard, so I'd have to

1601
02:34:22,520 --> 02:34:28,760
get used to that, and that's a whole learning curve right there, but I like watching them.

1602
02:34:29,480 --> 02:34:33,640
All right, let's get to some emails. We did get some emails tonight. Participate

1603
02:34:33,640 --> 02:34:39,400
at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, and we're going to read some on the air. So we have Amish

1604
02:34:39,400 --> 02:34:46,040
with our first email tonight. Hello, hello. Saying, dear OLR, hi. Amish here, or Michikins on Twitch.

1605
02:34:46,040 --> 02:34:49,880
First and foremost, I'd like to ask you that you please excuse any spelling and grammar mistakes,

1606
02:34:49,880 --> 02:34:56,120
as my spelling and grammar are horrible. Well, lucky you got me tonight. Just teasing, maybe.

1607
02:34:56,120 --> 02:35:01,800
All right, so moving on. No worries. I have bad spelling and grammar because text messages have

1608
02:35:01,800 --> 02:35:07,800
ruined me, as I think they've ruined a lot of people. Anyway, now down to brass tacks. So

1609
02:35:07,800 --> 02:35:13,800
I've been watching the show since maybe early 2000-ish, and I have to say I am a long-time fan.

1610
02:35:13,800 --> 02:35:19,880
That is a very long time. So we started in the early 2000s, so thank you so much for being here

1611
02:35:19,880 --> 02:35:24,360
and being a part of it. Thank you, thank you. I may not always participate, but I do listen to

1612
02:35:24,360 --> 02:35:29,240
every show. I just wanted to let you know you are all doing a great job at uplifting every gamer's

1613
02:35:29,240 --> 02:35:33,800
voice and letting them be heard. That means a lot that somebody would call that out and acknowledge

1614
02:35:33,800 --> 02:35:38,600
that. So thank you very much, Amish. I appreciate that. I'm saying, continuing on with the email.

1615
02:35:38,600 --> 02:35:43,800
Anyway, what I was writing about was that recently you discussed inclusion of the disabled in games.

1616
02:35:44,360 --> 02:35:49,400
Well, recently I purchased Watch Dogs Legion and discovered they have closed captioning in the

1617
02:35:49,400 --> 02:35:54,760
game's menu. When you boot up the game, or is it load the game now? Yeah, I'm that old that I still

1618
02:35:54,760 --> 02:36:01,320
spell disc to mean disc and boot to mean load. Anyway, well, as long as you're not saying when I

1619
02:36:01,320 --> 02:36:07,400
load star comma eight comma one the game. That's an old C64 reference. I'll leave it at that. I

1620
02:36:07,400 --> 02:36:11,400
think people say boot load. I think we all know what you mean. So it's interchangeable, really.

1621
02:36:12,760 --> 02:36:17,960
It has the option to use captions and voice when playing the game. I thought that was really neat.

1622
02:36:17,960 --> 02:36:23,960
The game literally reads, that's the voice part, what's on the screen for the visually impaired.

1623
02:36:23,960 --> 02:36:29,160
That is really cool because I know we have folks who are visually impaired who have listened to

1624
02:36:29,160 --> 02:36:34,440
OLR in the past. I don't know if they're listening this week, but I know that type of accessibility

1625
02:36:34,440 --> 02:36:40,360
really allows them to play more games. And I am all about games are for everyone. So when a

1626
02:36:40,360 --> 02:36:44,920
developer takes the time to put that in their game, I think that means a lot to a lot of people.

1627
02:36:44,920 --> 02:36:49,640
So I think that's rad. And I'm glad you called that out so that, you know, if Watch Dogs Legion

1628
02:36:49,640 --> 02:36:55,160
maybe wasn't on your radar and maybe you have a disability that this could really help you,

1629
02:36:55,880 --> 02:37:01,400
we should put that game on people's radar. That's great. Meaning text and actions, which I think is

1630
02:37:01,400 --> 02:37:06,840
cool. Hopefully more games will include such info to help more and more disabled gamers out there.

1631
02:37:06,840 --> 02:37:11,560
Well, have a good day. Sincerely, Mish. Thank you so much for the email, Mish. Thank you for the

1632
02:37:11,560 --> 02:37:17,080
kind words about the show, of course. And thank you for the FYI that Watch Dogs Legion has some

1633
02:37:17,080 --> 02:37:24,920
pretty awesome accessibility issues. Really appreciate that. Cool, cool. And I gotta say,

1634
02:37:24,920 --> 02:37:29,720
you know what? Even when it comes to things like closed captioning, now I know that's different.

1635
02:37:29,720 --> 02:37:33,560
You were kind of talking about that there's like voices that'll narrate what's on screen,

1636
02:37:33,560 --> 02:37:38,360
kind of like, I don't know if you guys know this, but there will oftentimes be showings of movies

1637
02:37:38,360 --> 02:37:43,160
at the theater or like things you can get where there's like an extra like earpiece you can use

1638
02:37:43,160 --> 02:37:47,080
that if you are visually impaired will describe what's happening on the screen.

1639
02:37:47,080 --> 02:37:50,440
Cause like, you know, if there's, it's an action, if you're watching Fast and the Furious or

1640
02:37:50,440 --> 02:37:57,080
something, the dialogue in those movies is not exactly at shining point. So some say,

1641
02:37:57,080 --> 02:38:04,360
is it just like bananas, bananas, but like fiery car explosion. I haven't watched it. So I couldn't

1642
02:38:04,360 --> 02:38:10,040
tell you, but I think it does. I, you know, I don't want to poke fun at it because I think

1643
02:38:10,040 --> 02:38:14,360
it is a great thing that they're doing. Um, but you know, I think they do describe a little bit

1644
02:38:14,360 --> 02:38:18,040
more in detail what's going on. However, I will say that the reason why I brought it up, like

1645
02:38:18,040 --> 02:38:25,320
closed captions, like I, I am a fairly abled gamer where I don't necessarily need closed captions to

1646
02:38:25,320 --> 02:38:31,640
get through a game, but I like using them because what I do get is that I get really distracted by

1647
02:38:31,640 --> 02:38:37,400
background noise. And sometimes it's really hard for me to isolate of one voice when there's like

1648
02:38:37,400 --> 02:38:41,080
a lot of other stuff going on, like my brain kind of wants to go, well, what's that music? What's

1649
02:38:41,080 --> 02:38:45,560
this? You know, it's, it's kinda like, so when the closed captioning is on the screen, I can actually

1650
02:38:45,560 --> 02:38:51,160
kind of like focus on what the person is saying. And that I think is a great, and I will watch

1651
02:38:51,160 --> 02:38:57,640
movies with it. And I know some people hate it. Um, but like, if you've ever watched a foreign film,

1652
02:38:57,640 --> 02:39:02,120
you're reading that stuff anyway, which is silly. If you won't watch foreign movies, cause you have

1653
02:39:02,120 --> 02:39:06,280
to read subtitles, then you're missing the fuck out. Cause there's a lot of great stuff out there.

1654
02:39:06,280 --> 02:39:11,240
So, um, I will use closed captioning on, um, you know, English movies just so I can make sure I

1655
02:39:11,240 --> 02:39:16,520
don't miss things or a funny joke or things like that. Um, Bobby Blackwell says I watch Dr. Who

1656
02:39:16,520 --> 02:39:22,840
with closed captions because of the accents. Yeah. I mean, exactly. That's a good reason to,

1657
02:39:22,920 --> 02:39:27,480
uh, Questbuster says I grew up with sub-titled anime, so my eyes are ready.

1658
02:39:27,480 --> 02:39:31,880
And Questbuster also points out the first thing that Watchdogs Legion does is run you through

1659
02:39:31,880 --> 02:39:36,760
those accessibility options, which are pretty neat. Uh, Amish is in chat. Hey Amish, who says,

1660
02:39:36,760 --> 02:39:39,800
uh, Hey, yeah, I couldn't remember what it's called, but it literally tells you when the

1661
02:39:39,800 --> 02:39:44,840
game starts press X button. And I thought that was neat. I use captions myself because I'm visually

1662
02:39:44,840 --> 02:39:51,240
impaired somewhat. Uh, and they have that for Minecraft as well. W04 with a good comment too,

1663
02:39:51,320 --> 02:39:55,480
that closed captioning is a lifesaver when you have roommates. And that could go a variety of

1664
02:39:55,480 --> 02:39:59,320
ways because your roommates are being distracted in the background or like your roommates might be

1665
02:39:59,320 --> 02:40:02,520
on a different schedule and trying to sleep. So you're trying to watch a movie at a really

1666
02:40:02,520 --> 02:40:08,680
low volume. So yeah, a good call. So, uh, tiger con chat says my issues with movies with subtitles

1667
02:40:08,680 --> 02:40:14,840
is that it distracts me from actually seeing the visuals. Well, then you can, you know, they do

1668
02:40:14,840 --> 02:40:19,560
have dubs that are available if you want to do it that way. Sometimes it depends on the movie,

1669
02:40:19,880 --> 02:40:25,000
or turn closed captioning off, but I, what I like is that there's an option.

1670
02:40:26,200 --> 02:40:31,800
You can, you can do a tiger Claus way or you can do it my way. Like I think that option is great.

1671
02:40:31,800 --> 02:40:37,560
So, all right. Um, I will get to another email here, but Loki, did you want to chime in with any

1672
02:40:37,560 --> 02:40:42,600
last minute stories or anything here before I get to another email? Yeah. Since everyone was

1673
02:40:42,600 --> 02:40:48,360
memeing on the fact that the Xbox series X looks like a fridge, they went ahead and made it into

1674
02:40:48,360 --> 02:40:54,680
a fridge. So they're offering, well, they have three of them that were made three Xbox series X

1675
02:40:54,680 --> 02:41:00,520
fridges. Um, two, they gave to influencers one they're giving away. I thought it was funny

1676
02:41:00,520 --> 02:41:04,920
though, that they actually had a fridge that they made, or at least decked out one to look like a

1677
02:41:04,920 --> 02:41:09,800
Xbox series X. I think that's great. I love it. I wish I was Snoop dog. Cause he got one, right?

1678
02:41:11,160 --> 02:41:17,800
Yeah, he got one and I can't remember the tech. She's a tech streamer. She got one too. Uh,

1679
02:41:18,600 --> 02:41:22,920
I just seen, I think, um, and yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They're giving one away.

1680
02:41:23,960 --> 02:41:30,520
She was huge on Justin TV back in the day, if I remember right. So, uh, anyway, I,

1681
02:41:30,520 --> 02:41:38,760
damn, I wish we were popular Loki. I want an Xbox fridge. Eight or 18 years of anything, you know,

1682
02:41:38,760 --> 02:41:44,200
or, or was it, or is it one other one I was going to mention too. Uh, so they made the announcement,

1683
02:41:44,200 --> 02:41:49,800
the play date is almost done. It's going to be $149 and coming out early 2021. Yeah. And then I

1684
02:41:49,800 --> 02:41:57,720
saw, what was it? Uh, Danny over there at, uh, um, gamertag radio is like, Oh look, Hey, I got

1685
02:41:57,720 --> 02:42:02,120
this too. It's like, okay, listen, you've gotten enough free systems already in the last few days,

1686
02:42:02,120 --> 02:42:07,640
doing your photo shoots and all that. Cut it out. Don't hate on other people's success.

1687
02:42:07,640 --> 02:42:11,960
Don't hate, don't hate. I'm just joking. It's just funny though. Cause like, so here's my

1688
02:42:11,960 --> 02:42:15,960
glamour shoot out front of my apartment. Here's my glamour shoot in my apartment.

1689
02:42:15,960 --> 02:42:19,320
They made, he made a lot of content. They got it. They got their money's worth there. Yeah.

1690
02:42:20,040 --> 02:42:24,760
All right. Uh, let's see. Vid power and chat says, well, the Xbox series fridge be worth a

1691
02:42:24,760 --> 02:42:29,320
lot of money in the distant future due to its rarity. Why would you ever sell it? If you were

1692
02:42:29,320 --> 02:42:34,600
Snoop Dogg or I Justine, why would you ever sell it? I'd use it. Come on Microsoft. We're looking

1693
02:42:34,600 --> 02:42:38,360
at getting a new house. I want a new fridge. All right. And I would love my fridge to grow,

1694
02:42:38,360 --> 02:42:42,120
glow green like that. Like I know a lot of people associate green with the fridge and like,

1695
02:42:42,120 --> 02:42:46,520
Oh, it's moldy or something. But no, I think, I think an Xbox would give the kitchen a nice

1696
02:42:46,520 --> 02:42:51,320
mint flavor. Don't you? All right. Anyway, let's get to another email here and then I'll,

1697
02:42:51,320 --> 02:42:55,640
I'll see if there's anything else low. He wants to talk about this email is coming from Y Y R

1698
02:42:55,640 --> 02:43:01,160
over at participate at orange lawns, radio.com saying hello, LR on last week's episode,

1699
02:43:01,160 --> 02:43:05,320
there was a discussion about whether streamers should have to pay royalties to game developers

1700
02:43:05,320 --> 02:43:10,920
or publishers as a small indie developer myself. And I'm going to add this part,

1701
02:43:10,920 --> 02:43:15,640
download super multitasking. Thank you. Uh, continuing the email, I found the discussion

1702
02:43:15,640 --> 02:43:20,360
interesting and I felt compelled to weigh in as an example, it was argued that since music

1703
02:43:20,360 --> 02:43:24,360
royalty should be paid. If music is played, why shouldn't developer be paid when their game is

1704
02:43:24,360 --> 02:43:28,440
played. And once again, we have a situation where games are different from other forms of media.

1705
02:43:28,440 --> 02:43:32,920
Music is obtained and paid for very differently from games. Most of us either replay music that

1706
02:43:32,920 --> 02:43:37,720
we already own, listen to music included in the background of games we play, or hear music using

1707
02:43:37,720 --> 02:43:43,560
a streaming service. Back in my day, you used to tape them off the radio and then play the cassette

1708
02:43:43,560 --> 02:43:48,600
tape. Am I right? Loki. That's how we used to do it. All right. Um, where the beginning and the

1709
02:43:48,600 --> 02:43:52,760
end are kind of missing. All right. Uh, anyway, uh, let's see what are the streaming service? Yes.

1710
02:43:52,760 --> 02:43:57,560
Uh, if it's the latter, the streaming service pays a tiny royalty to an artist and or a publisher,

1711
02:43:57,560 --> 02:44:00,920
but it's one of the other two options. No money changes hands at all.

1712
02:44:01,720 --> 02:44:06,440
If a streamer decides to play one of my games on stream, they've already paid me. None of my

1713
02:44:06,440 --> 02:44:10,280
currently released games are free to play. So in essence, they've already paid me a royalty of

1714
02:44:10,280 --> 02:44:15,560
sorts further. I could consider it free advertising. When a streamer plays one of my games, I naturally

1715
02:44:15,560 --> 02:44:20,200
want as much exposure as possible. So this definitely is a benefit to me. Now you could

1716
02:44:20,200 --> 02:44:24,440
make a counter argument. What if I sell a million copies and I no longer need that exposure. The

1717
02:44:24,440 --> 02:44:28,760
counterpoint to that is simple. This is the gaming industry. One successful game does not guarantee

1718
02:44:28,760 --> 02:44:32,760
another. When my next release comes out, I will absolutely need to get it in front of as many

1719
02:44:32,760 --> 02:44:37,400
eyeballs as possible. So naturally I'll want the streamers to help me out. Once again, it's a

1720
02:44:37,400 --> 02:44:42,840
mutually beneficial relationship on both sides. Streamers get content developers get exposure.

1721
02:44:42,840 --> 02:44:47,000
I see zero issues with it. If I'm offered a royalty in the future, maybe I'd take a small

1722
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:52,680
one, say 2%, like the milk. I just wouldn't want to disturb that mutually beneficial relationship.

1723
02:44:52,680 --> 02:44:58,360
So that's my two cents. And you know what? I appreciate hearing a developer perspective on

1724
02:44:58,360 --> 02:45:04,280
that. I'm still of the feeling that it should maybe be a little bit of a choice. And again,

1725
02:45:04,280 --> 02:45:09,160
it's not like a hard line for me. Like I'm not saying like, oh, they need to be collecting their

1726
02:45:09,160 --> 02:45:15,000
money and all this stuff. I'm more of the mindset where I'm kind of surprised companies like

1727
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:20,440
Nintendo haven't taken more of a stance on it and tried to be more assertive because Nintendo

1728
02:45:20,440 --> 02:45:26,680
doesn't really need the exposure in that regard. I'm just kind of surprised we haven't really had

1729
02:45:26,680 --> 02:45:32,280
that conversation. And we kind of have had to an extent on like YouTube, but Nintendo has really

1730
02:45:32,280 --> 02:45:38,760
yet to like really assert it on Twitch. So maybe they do ultimately feel like, hey, the exposure,

1731
02:45:38,760 --> 02:45:45,800
the talk, it's all ads for our game. It's a good thing in the long run. But I just kind of feel

1732
02:45:45,800 --> 02:45:56,360
like if that shoe were to ever to drop, I'm not sure the streamers out there are as in the clear

1733
02:45:57,000 --> 02:46:02,840
under repurposing the content with so much percentage of your own content and those

1734
02:46:02,840 --> 02:46:08,760
sort of laws that they kind of claim as they might think. But I think at the end of the day,

1735
02:46:08,760 --> 02:46:13,960
and I think common ground that I do have with everybody in this scenario is that we need to

1736
02:46:13,960 --> 02:46:18,520
take another look at this law because the trademark, the patent, the copyright and all

1737
02:46:18,520 --> 02:46:23,320
this law we're working with is from a very different era when these sorts of technologies

1738
02:46:23,320 --> 02:46:27,480
didn't exist. And we need to kind of examine this law as a whole. So we don't have a fucking gray

1739
02:46:27,480 --> 02:46:31,320
area so that we're not asking these types of questions as to like, what is a person entitled

1740
02:46:31,320 --> 02:46:35,320
to and dah, dah, dah, dah, and all this stuff. So that's where my head is at with it, honestly,

1741
02:46:35,320 --> 02:46:40,200
at the end of the day. So yeah, and Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, fair use in video games

1742
02:46:40,200 --> 02:46:45,000
has never gone in front of a judge. So we don't know if it's legal or not yet. And that's what

1743
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:51,560
I'm saying is that look, I love streaming too, but I'm of this reality where it's like, you know

1744
02:46:51,560 --> 02:46:58,520
what? The shoe might drop someday, but, and I'll end with this and I'll move on with the rest of

1745
02:46:58,520 --> 02:47:03,720
YYIR's email. If that shoe were to drop and I couldn't stream Nintendo games anymore, I keep

1746
02:47:03,720 --> 02:47:08,040
making them the bad guy and I'm only doing it because of that history with YouTube and everything

1747
02:47:08,040 --> 02:47:13,800
they tried to pull there. It makes it easy to point at them as the bad guy first. But if YYIR

1748
02:47:13,800 --> 02:47:19,720
were to come out and say, look, I know the law allows me to collect, but as an indie developer,

1749
02:47:19,720 --> 02:47:24,200
I'm not going to because of all these reasons I just stated in the OLR email, then guess what

1750
02:47:24,200 --> 02:47:30,680
YYIR, I'm playing your game. And I bet a lot of streamers would feel the same way. So, and I think

1751
02:47:30,680 --> 02:47:34,840
at the end of the day, and that is kind of where I landed last week is that you can make it an

1752
02:47:34,840 --> 02:47:39,720
option, but at the end of the day, streamers, if there's companies out there that say we realize

1753
02:47:39,720 --> 02:47:44,680
we could collect if we wanted to, we're not going to, to encourage you to play our game,

1754
02:47:44,680 --> 02:47:48,680
then streamers are going to follow suit. And I really think at the end of the day,

1755
02:47:48,680 --> 02:47:52,520
that's what's going to happen. Okay. So I think, I hope you hear the common ground that I really

1756
02:47:52,520 --> 02:47:57,000
think we kind of both have, but I'd love to hear your perspective as somebody who develops and

1757
02:47:57,000 --> 02:48:02,120
quite frankly has had their games streamed by me and other people out there, as you were talking

1758
02:48:02,120 --> 02:48:06,360
about in a previous email, which is always cool to see. All right. Onto another topic from YYIR.

1759
02:48:07,320 --> 02:48:13,800
I'll end by saying that I'm deeply disturbed and highly offended by a comment Rob made last week.

1760
02:48:14,760 --> 02:48:22,280
Well, he dared to say that White Castle burgers were gross. Rob, you take that back. You take

1761
02:48:22,280 --> 02:48:27,320
that back right now, or I will be all over you like mayonnaise on French fries or not.

1762
02:48:28,520 --> 02:48:38,360
My official response is I said what I said. That is my response. White Castle burgers are gross.

1763
02:48:38,360 --> 02:48:42,840
You know why they're gross? And I think it's why I don't really like McDonald's burgers that much

1764
02:48:42,840 --> 02:48:50,760
either. It's that steam cooking that they do at White Castle. It's gross. Now look,

1765
02:48:52,200 --> 02:48:57,640
I wasn't high when I ate them in Vegas and maybe if I had been, I would have enjoyed it more.

1766
02:48:57,640 --> 02:49:02,840
Not that I'm saying you are, but I'm just saying. I am disappointed that their closest restaurant

1767
02:49:02,840 --> 02:49:08,520
is in Vegas, but yeah, go on. Yeah. And that's where I had them for the first time was in Vegas.

1768
02:49:08,600 --> 02:49:14,520
So, there is that. S2100 Matt says, I mean, Rob wasn't wrong. Thank you, Matt. Appreciate

1769
02:49:14,520 --> 02:49:21,560
you being in my quarter. W04 says do not back down, Rob. I won't. This is my hill and I'm dying

1770
02:49:21,560 --> 02:49:27,160
on it. White Castle is overrated, but W04 does follow up saying in and out over everything.

1771
02:49:27,160 --> 02:49:30,760
Maybe it's because I live in California, but like in and out. In and out is good.

1772
02:49:30,760 --> 02:49:38,440
I don't dislike in and out by any means, but I feel like I only eat it when people are visiting

1773
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:42,520
want to have in and out because they can never have it. And that's enough for me.

1774
02:49:42,520 --> 02:49:48,840
Like it's very rare that I'm like craving in and out. You know what I mean? I'm usually more,

1775
02:49:48,840 --> 02:49:53,720
I'm more now into places like Smashburger and like those types of places that kind of

1776
02:49:53,720 --> 02:49:58,840
Chipotle-ed the burger by doing and Shake Shack. We actually have a Shake Shack here in SAC now.

1777
02:49:58,840 --> 02:50:04,760
That came up on a previous episode and I like going there. I like the slightly more upscale.

1778
02:50:05,400 --> 02:50:11,560
Um, I do think as far as like, but see steaming the burgers, see, uh, DJ Rama S says, bro,

1779
02:50:11,560 --> 02:50:15,880
steam burgers are the best. Hard disagree. I'm sorry. Like if I, if I have to eat a fast food

1780
02:50:15,880 --> 02:50:20,840
burger and I know now I know I'm going to get screamed at if I'm talking like fast food,

1781
02:50:21,560 --> 02:50:27,240
honestly, like the way Burger King does it with the flame grill is way better than like

1782
02:50:27,240 --> 02:50:33,080
McDonald's or White Castle. That is, that is the way to do it. So that's my opinion. All right.

1783
02:50:35,480 --> 02:50:41,160
Uh, let's see. So lastly from YYR, uh, thanks again for the show. Election day seemed to be

1784
02:50:41,160 --> 02:50:46,600
miles away and here it is just two days out. We've made it this far. Hope you all continue

1785
02:50:46,600 --> 02:50:53,720
to hang in there. I'm trying. Hugs, Aaron, YYR. Thank you. It's uh, it's, it's been a crazy year

1786
02:50:53,720 --> 02:51:00,760
and like, honestly, I'm sitting here going, what can I do on Tuesday night that will not like,

1787
02:51:00,760 --> 02:51:06,360
and like the easy answer is play video games, but like where I am not even tempted to flip the

1788
02:51:06,360 --> 02:51:11,800
channel and obsess over the map as the vote tallies are coming in. And, you know, my,

1789
02:51:11,800 --> 02:51:16,760
my own feelings on all of this, like, what can I just like, I seriously just want to get in the car

1790
02:51:16,760 --> 02:51:21,000
and drive to the forest and go camping or look at stars or something that night, just

1791
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:26,760
so I am nowhere near your, you're going to go to the Fort. Yes. I'm going to go to the Fort.

1792
02:51:26,760 --> 02:51:35,400
All right. Uh, any other last minute stories for us? Thank you for the email YYR.

1793
02:51:36,680 --> 02:51:41,640
Um, no, I don't really have anything else. All right. Then I think we're going to wrap up the

1794
02:51:41,640 --> 02:51:46,040
show. So, uh, that's it. Thank you guys so much for listening to Orange Launch Radio. I appreciate

1795
02:51:46,040 --> 02:51:51,960
you participating along with the show. Uh, thank you so much. Uh, we are the show where every gamer

1796
02:51:51,960 --> 02:51:55,000
has a voice. So if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, tell a friend,

1797
02:51:55,000 --> 02:52:01,000
uh, help us spread the word, um, tell a friend or two about the show, a nice tweet, an auto host on

1798
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:06,520
Twitch goes a long way. I still can't see the host cause I'm logged in with the wrong account, but,

1799
02:52:06,520 --> 02:52:10,680
uh, I'll have to talk to Bobby if maybe I should switch over to the main account when I do this so

1800
02:52:10,680 --> 02:52:16,920
I can see the host. Um, but yeah, thank you guys so much for that. Um, uh, for, for the hosts and

1801
02:52:16,920 --> 02:52:20,280
all that stuff and those that go the extra mile with the follows and the bits and subs and all

1802
02:52:20,280 --> 02:52:24,360
that really appreciate you. And I'll, I'll shout those out after the show here, uh, live on Twitch.

1803
02:52:24,360 --> 02:52:29,960
Um, and thanks. Thanks for, um, uh, giving us something to look forward to in these pandemic-y

1804
02:52:29,960 --> 02:52:34,920
times where it's like, ah, I'm stuck at home all the time, nothing to do, but the show gives me

1805
02:52:34,920 --> 02:52:39,880
something to look forward to. So I really appreciate that. All right. Um, final thoughts

1806
02:52:39,880 --> 02:52:46,360
time. Loki, how about you? Your final thought? Just going to keep working on my game. Sounds

1807
02:52:46,360 --> 02:52:53,160
like a way to do it. Make making progress. All right. And my final thought is, um, whatever

1808
02:52:53,160 --> 02:52:59,720
happens on Tuesday, it's going to be fine. No matter which side of the fence you're on politically,

1809
02:52:59,720 --> 02:53:07,080
it's gonna, it might feel very bad. Um, but you know, and I've said this on a previous episode

1810
02:53:07,080 --> 02:53:11,560
about you all know my love of drag queens and things like that. And I, I kind of ending with

1811
02:53:11,560 --> 02:53:17,480
my final thought as something like Katya said on an episode of All Stars 2 that has not left my

1812
02:53:17,480 --> 02:53:23,000
mind since then, uh, is when she says, she looks in the mirror and she says, I'm not going to panic

1813
02:53:23,560 --> 02:53:30,280
because I don't do that anymore. So that is my mindset going into whatever may come this week.

1814
02:53:30,280 --> 02:53:36,520
And, um, and 2020 in general, because even if the election does go the way I want it to,

1815
02:53:36,520 --> 02:53:39,320
and I'm talking up and down the ballot with propositions and everything else that I'm,

1816
02:53:39,320 --> 02:53:47,960
I'm looking at, not just the, not just the big one. Um, I, I just, yeah, I'm not gonna panic

1817
02:53:47,960 --> 02:53:52,520
about a lot of stuff that I don't, I can't control. So that's, that's it. Yeah. And pod

1818
02:53:52,520 --> 02:53:57,800
culture and chat says, it's going to be ugly no matter how things go. And I think that is true.

1819
02:53:57,800 --> 02:54:03,160
Act F says, if we have endured 2020 so far, we can make this work. And I hope so. And I hope the one

1820
02:54:03,160 --> 02:54:11,000
positive thing about this extremely negative year is that humanity can evolve as a result of it.

1821
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:14,600
If that makes sense, we're going to become smarter together and stronger together,

1822
02:54:15,800 --> 02:54:22,440
hopefully. And I'll leave you on that thought. So, um, enjoy playing your games, enjoy, uh,

1823
02:54:22,440 --> 02:54:29,240
the next, um, you know, seven days of gaming, enjoy, uh, this week, you know, uh, and enjoy

1824
02:54:29,240 --> 02:54:34,440
looking forward to the next consoles, PlayStation five, uh, and Xbox series X and all that good

1825
02:54:34,440 --> 02:54:40,840
stuff. Have a wonderful week. You guys we'll see you next time. Good night. You've been listening
