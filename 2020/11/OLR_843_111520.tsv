0	13360	I've always envied the difference of music culture in Japan. Since I started playing
13360	17200	imported games, I also learned about the number of albums they release. Everything from official
17200	21940	OSTs, remix or remake OSTs like the Final Fantasy piano and vocal collections to doujin
21940	25280	released by the producers themselves. But here in the States and on the internet at
25280	29500	large the story is very different and I don't wish the legal hassle on anyone. Join your
29500	33500	hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki as they explain this and the rest of the week's
33500	36500	news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
36500	46000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
46000	53140	where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio Live. Once again tonight episode
53140	60560	number 843 of our show for this November the 15th of 2020. My name is Rob Roberts and
60560	66320	I'm joined here as I am live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network with my co-hosts
66320	70140	say hello first and foremost to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
70140	71140	Hello.
71140	73140	Hi Jamie, how are you doing?
73140	82080	Oh I'm on week four but I'm finally starting to feel better. I'll put it this way my tests
82080	85080	are negative but my doctor hasn't ruled out COVID.
85080	89900	Oh interesting. I've heard of false negatives and things like that so.
89900	93900	Well the thing is is that I also did the serology test and the serology test is pretty much
93900	103220	useless because a good portion of the population doesn't create antibodies.
103220	107700	Well hang in there I'm glad to hear you're at least on the mend and doing better.
107700	115800	Yeah I basically have one more week of recovery and then I'm clear so.
115800	116800	Sounds good.
116800	120640	It's just my voice has been cutting out so but I can talk a little bit longer just it
120640	125000	still is kind of like sounding like you know that fry.
125000	128520	I'm really looking forward to the day when all of us can be in the same studio again
128520	133600	I know it's still several months out but just really looking forward to that day so.
133600	135800	Just wait until we have a competent administration.
135800	142460	I know 65 days anyway before I introduce everybody else it's no secret obviously this
142460	147920	week new game console release week it's a big week and dark soccer we've talked before
147920	151900	on the show about how you guys are kind of waiting for a little bit so I thought since
151900	155560	you are the queen of classic games I thought I'd put you on the spot with a different question
155560	159140	here and I'm going to open this up to our chat as well because of course we do tape
159140	163540	live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network twitch.tv slash a vog network Sunday
163540	166860	night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwell show
166860	170660	so the question is we're going to be talking about some launch games that came out and
170660	174700	you know some other things too but looking back on all of the systems throughout history
174700	180300	and all of the various launch titles we've had like you know.
180300	183740	Games that have launched consoles there's been some good ones there's been some terrible
183740	189220	ones I'm kind of curious dark soccer if you have a particular favorite or maybe memorable
189220	194860	launch title in your heart.
194860	197780	I am putting her on the spot I didn't warn her about this question so she might need
197780	201740	a little time to think but I'm putting you all on the spot in our chat room as well if
201740	206900	you guys have any questions or any any questions of course you have questions.
206900	210180	There were definitely ones that I like but I think the one that really just stuck itself
210180	216560	out as memorable for me actually I've got two that I can name because I just remember
216560	222800	how how cool it felt you know was a I'm pretty sure Super Mario World was a launch title
222800	229680	it was yeah I mean I remembered Super Mario Brothers wasn't initially so I kind of was
229680	235520	getting into a little bit mixed but yeah Super Mario World was like one of the big ones for
235520	243440	me we had gotten my mom's like that year should we get your brother a Super Nintendo or Genesis
243440	249440	and I'm like you're getting them Super Nintendo and it's for me so I told her what games to
249440	253760	get I was like I don't care what else you get but you have to get you know a link to
253760	263800	the past you know but Super Mario World was for me just the big thing that made me super
263800	271560	super excited about having a Super Nintendo I played the shit out of it my brother sucked
271560	279400	at it but you know they were like 10 something like that and I probably played it so much more
279400	287480	than they did I've beaten it completely by myself when the game first came out and when I dedicated
287480	296920	a lot of time to link to the past after that but that really stuck out for me and then another one
296920	307000	was Sonic Adventure because remember we had our our Dreamcast pretty much right after the
307000	314920	Japanese launch and we played so much Sonic Adventure and you know looked for all the
314920	323480	glitchy stuff and everything I really really enjoyed Sonic Adventure I was really into it
323480	330760	of course it had some of my favorite Japanese voice actors in it like for Knuckles at this
330760	337240	time okay I have to also explain I had a minor obsession with with Hayashi Nobutoshi who was also
338440	346040	he was Tatsuki in Fushigi Yugi he was Basara in Macross 7 got a really amazing singing voice
346600	357560	and you know so and he was you know he he was in the game and I he was Knuckles he was Knuckles
357560	365400	voice actor and so I was really really just enamored with the game I liked playing Amy even
365400	373080	though she was a little bit annoying I liked the music in it I was so enamored so when the US
373080	378120	Dreamcast launch happened so I actually have to rewind a little bit more for that because there
378120	386360	was the rental before launch and we did rent a US one yeah yeah and that demo version that was the
386360	395800	US one and then after that when we got our our US Dreamcast we just played through Sonic Adventure
395800	401160	again of course I had to switch the voices back to Japanese because after playing it so long in
401160	407240	Japanese the US voices were disjointed to me it was just not saying the voice actor was bad I'm
407240	412440	just saying that I was still used I mean I have the same problem with anime today like if I go
412440	415880	watch any Dragon Ball I have to watch it in Japanese because those are the voices I heard
415880	421960	first right um I still prefer Ranma in Japanese because I watched it that way first Sailor Moon
421960	428280	same thing you know um so uh the one of the few anime that I'm not like that with is those who
428280	432760	hunt elves because I first watched it in English and I got used to those voice actors so it's kind
432760	441000	of um but but going back to it um you know I I those two were probably the big ones that stick
441000	448440	out in my head as far as um some of the more memorable ones all right um great yeah I really
448440	452280	loved it great answers um let me add some stuff in chat and then I've got to introduce uh the
452280	458040	other folks on tonight's show who've been waiting patiently uh so uh let me see uh act def says
458040	462280	breath of the wild is definitely one of the best launch titles ever yeah nintendo certainly knows
462280	466840	how to launch a console huh I like this answer from bobby blackwolf my favorite xbox 360 launch
466840	474920	title was geometry wars and she hulk 10 says dead rising 3 for xbox one was and is awesome I forgot
474920	479560	that was a launch title and yeah the dead rising series that was a good one all right uh waiting
479640	483960	patiently and with us every week say hello of course to tech master loki joining us tonight
485240	490440	hello hey loki how are you doing I'm doing okay what are you running behind you tonight is that
490440	495800	is that final fight like a sequel not the first one what is that no it's cadillacs and dinosaurs
495800	502600	I have an idea for like I've seen that for um a game I was supposed to put behind me and like
502600	507080	I had it like earlier this week I was like oh yeah I saw a game like yeah I need to do that one and
507080	513640	completely forgot it today oh no like mo wiki was it that I saw like it was something that I saw out
513640	518360	there I was like oh yeah I totally remember that I need to put that behind me but nope completely
518360	524200	forgot so my memory has always been terrible it's been getting worse as I get older and now it's
524200	528280	getting even worse because this whole quarantine situation and they actually say that like you
528280	533160	know it's it's contributing to people having the brain fog and all that stuff so it's uh
533880	538440	welcome to old age loki yeah I don't know if it's that it's just there's you know different things
538440	544920	going on this week so I I'm sure whatever it was that I saw you know I thought it might have been
544920	550040	like um sam and max I can't remember if I've done that already because of all the like sam max news
550040	555080	we'll be talking about but um I don't know if it was that it was something else but like I saw it
555080	559720	and I was like oh yeah I need to do that and then immediately like today I was like okay wait what
559720	563560	game was that I was thinking of so I have it really quickly come up with something all right
564120	567560	well we'll come back to you in a minute because I want to talk about how launch week has been
567560	571480	going for the new consoles uh I want to know did you well okay I'm gonna even guess did you even
571480	576440	get your xbox you were worried about that with walmart no it came right when they said it was
576440	581880	going to so yeah I actually earlier than they said it was going to so they originally said it
581880	587240	was going to be here on the 12th but it ended up being here on launch day so it was fine um
588200	593000	but yeah yeah I have it sitting right here under my monitor I think I got my got my controller
593000	600120	and everything but yeah it's sitting here I got a brand new 4k monitor um for it so it's looking
600120	603000	nice all right well I'm gonna come back to you in a minute because we're gonna talk all about the
603000	607560	new xbox but um he's been waiting there so patiently and you guys on twitch uh that are
607560	612280	watching live can see that he's back tonight and I've got to introduce say hello everybody to
612280	616440	shane or shad starzik on twitch if you will who's joining us again tonight hi shane
617480	621560	hello and I gotta say shane you are looking so much better than the last time you were here
622760	627960	yeah I feel better good still run down I'm actually feeling run down but that's okay
627960	632760	I've got dr pepper and I have to study for a test tomorrow so I'm gonna be up all night
632760	637320	yeah and for those um that missed uh the episode you were here what about like four or five weeks
637320	643800	ago um on the show and you were right in the midst of three was it wow time flies uh you were
643800	647640	right in the midst of battling covid last time you were on the show but you came here anyway to talk
647640	652360	about I think it was the pokemon dlc you were talking about that night so um and you you were
652360	657720	kind of like lying in bed still but tonight you're you're propped up you've got you know that light
657720	665720	effect I know I'm in my I'm in my computer chair my little corner in the living room and I'm using
665720	673000	my brand new iphone 12 pro math oh rub it in why don't you shaky I don't have a web so this is just
673000	677240	what has to work no honestly the phone works I'm using the phone for this particular shot here
677240	683160	that's going out on twitch right now so it works all right um but uh part of the reason I brought
683160	687320	you here tonight was because uh if you've been listening to orange launch radio then you know
687320	692280	that I want to get an or I've gotten an xbox pre-ordered one of those uh we'll talk about
692280	697800	how that went because it wasn't so smooth loki got an xbox none of us really have playstation
697800	706440	5 represented here uh so shane you got a playstation 5 this week right and so so you've
706440	713160	got both so I want to talk to you about how this week went so obviously um this is a big week uh
713160	717160	last week our show got cut short abruptly unfortunately thanks to the internet which
717160	721640	I'm hoping is holding in there more steady tonight knock on wood but I've had less problems this week
721640	727240	which is good um but um last week we were still able to talk for an hour and a half we talked a
727240	732920	good chunk about how we are on the dawn of a new generation with playstation and xbox launching
732920	737000	new consoles you know and we were kind of wondering you know is it too early for them to
737000	741880	be doing it is it going to be worth it and all this and now we have a lot of answers to many of
741880	746520	those questions um echoing something that bobby said uh he goes on of course before us here at the
746520	752040	voice geeks network echoing something that he said uh is that well clearly the launch went
752040	756840	great because they're selling out so no these consoles didn't go or I'm sorry no these consoles
756840	761640	didn't come out too early because they're selling out so it's going very well and yeah the consoles
761640	769560	have been very hard to obtain um loki I'll start with you uh on the xbox series x so tell us how
769560	773880	that went for you the ordering process and kind of what you've been playing on it I figured we
773880	778920	usually do a kickoff topic here on tonight's show and then we do our gaming weeks but this week the
778920	783960	big topic is our gaming weeks so we're just going to kind of jump into it so loki I'm going to kind
783960	789320	of ask you about your gaming week with the xbox series x sure so like the ordering process it was
789320	795880	basically when those orders were opened up originally back in september I just had all
795880	801080	the different you know retailers online uh all their sites open and walmart happened to be the
801080	806200	first one that let me put something in my cart and submit the order so that's what I went with
806200	811720	and so I was always I was kind of worried that it may not arrive on time or at all because I
811720	817880	had issues with my mario kart live where came to be launch day and they hadn't even shipped yet
817880	822120	so I had to cancel that one but thankfully I was able to get that in store um I knew that wouldn't
822120	828920	be the case with the xbox series x so um other than that I mean it was fine it arrived on time
828920	832520	like I said you know I was worried that it would be here late um because originally they were
833080	839400	estimating the 12th but it arrived on the 10th and I was like cool and uh
840200	845720	uh so really what I've been playing on I don't really have a ton of stuff so I haven't had an
845720	852840	xbox since the 360 so I finally got games pass ultimate and I just was downloading some stuff
852840	857720	on there actually I was looking at all my xbox stuff I have on there like 94 games because of
857720	864520	my old 360 games of gold stuff um so there's quite a bit old 360 games I have but I don't
864520	872440	really have a lot of um xbox one games I guess I have a few with like crackdown and uh forza
872440	879080	because I purchased those on pc uh which is nice but um so I ended up getting yakuza like a dragon
879080	883320	because I wasn't really sure of what launch games I really wanted there was nothing really kind of
883640	888440	standing out and I was trying to look at look for something that was really showing off the series
888440	894600	x and really the only thing they have is like forza horizon 4 and I already have that so I
894600	899480	started downloading that it's taken a long time but I think it's finally downloaded now I've been
899480	906120	mainly playing yakuza um which is interesting because I've never played a yakuza game before
907000	914520	and this one is more like a um an rpg so they've they actually set up because the main character
914520	921480	is a huge fan of dragon quest and so it's all turn-based combat which I I love it it's great
921480	929080	cool um the story is a bit slow but it's just like it really feels like playing like a dragon
929080	933560	quest or final fantasy game it's just kind of funny in that sense I I heard that I heard that
933560	938040	that was um like that that it was more like an old school rpg so it's kind of more of a spin-off
938040	941800	game so you know and I've had people for years telling me you need to get into yakuza you need
941800	947000	to get into that series I wonder if the fans of the series would think this is a good one to start
947000	951480	with or no don't start here definitely different because the other ones are brawlers I mean this is
951480	957160	still a brawler but it's turn-based so it's different um it's all right I mean it's certainly
957160	964600	not like a huge powerhouse like pretty looking game I mean it does look um not like it's pushing
964600	970120	the high-end graphics or anything like that but I don't know it's all right I I've enjoyed it a
970120	974280	little bit I haven't been playing a whole ton because I've been working on my game but I did
974280	980200	play like a probably like five hours of it so far and it's all right it's just there's so much story
980200	985240	and we're like I'm still like in the tutorial section of the game haven't even gotten very far
985240	992120	and it's just it's so much dialogue like I get it but there's like some of it doesn't really
992920	998200	it's just like dragging out so long like oh my god and they have options to skip past dialogue
998200	1003720	but I'm like worried I'm missing something but I'm really not missing anything um so I don't
1003720	1010280	know it's just it's really slow to get started but it is somewhat interesting the story is
1010280	1015400	interesting enough it's just it's like oh my god when are we going to get to like the actual like
1015400	1021640	game um but the action's cool so there are some action sequences and stuff in the game um I don't
1021640	1026840	know I I enjoy it so far we'll we'll see how long I play through it and everything um aside from
1026840	1031960	that I did try Minecraft a little bit because my kid wanted me to play it and honestly I can't say
1031960	1039640	that it looks any different that's definitely not a game that would uh benefit from the series x now
1039640	1047320	saying that once they do push out the ray tracing stuff which I have played on pc uh that does
1047320	1053240	look really great like if they can do that on a series x then that would be definitely one to
1053240	1060040	revisit because it looks really good when they do that um but right now obviously it doesn't
1060040	1067080	look any different than it did before um I saw it in the list I haven't downloaded it yet but
1067960	1073880	lost odysseys on games pass since I was like we should go back to lost odyssey um but no I've
1073880	1079320	been really kind of just going through there to see you know what really um showcase the system
1079320	1085640	I know Ori um might be a good one um fours horizon like I said I've already downloaded that but like
1085640	1090680	I'm worried I don't want to fill up the hard drive already with this all the games out and stuff and
1090680	1098920	I mean hopefully still uh we have uh cyberpunk coming out in you know a little less than a month
1098920	1103400	yeah we definitely definitely don't want another delay on that for sure yeah so hopefully that
1103400	1108520	comes out but yeah I'm gonna jump in here because I I forgot we have a time constraint with shane
1108520	1112120	so I want to make sure he's able to um get his impressions especially with the playstation 5
1112120	1115960	and so forth so I'll come back to you though loki if you have more to add um but shane how
1115960	1123080	was your week with the new consoles how did that go for you um so pretty easy for me in terms of
1123080	1128840	getting them we've talked about like the magical powers I have for things like persuasion for
1128840	1136520	people to get stuff done and I'm also an expert at getting in line for things which is kind of how I
1136520	1142760	got at least one of these consoles um so xbox whatever you guys are going to talk about that
1142760	1147800	I haven't really done much with it to be completely honest um real quick why why is
1147800	1152600	the xbox taking a back seat for you because it wasn't the console I was originally getting I
1152600	1162040	only got it under a weird circumstance so um okay ps5 I went to best buy because I had gotten a
1162040	1166680	pre-order there and I went at six in the morning because that was my time slots because they were
1166680	1174760	doing time slots to pick up uh your system and literally there were probably about 20 people 20
1174760	1180200	25 people that were there for the same time slot like they were all people that had it pre-ordered
1180200	1187400	it was a pretty smooth process except I saw if you haven't seen the box I can't really reach it
1187400	1191960	right so whatever it has a little handle on top so you can carry it it's one of those like cheap
1191960	1198680	little plastic handles isn't it it's really flimsy and I saw three people hold it by the
1198680	1202920	handle and the handle snapped while they were holding it and the console come crashing down
1202920	1210520	to the floor as they were walking out of the store yike so yeah that wasn't good um otherwise
1210520	1217800	I I don't want to say I'm a Sony fanboy but I tend to just play on their products mostly besides
1217800	1225320	Nintendo and uh I love my ps5 the controller is fantastic it's just basically the same as
1225320	1232760	what the joy cons were trying to do but a little more advanced feeling um for launch games I've
1233400	1241320	I got four I got Demon's Souls which I haven't played yet I just installed it I got the Miles
1241320	1246520	Morales game that came with Spider-Man 1 and so I played a little bit of Spider-Man but not Miles
1246520	1254760	Morales yet uh I got the Sackboy game haven't even opened it yet or installed it and I got
1254760	1261720	Godfall I did install that and I played that for probably a good hour and a half pretty fun little
1262520	1271000	like hack and slash loot game um and it's really pretty and that's what I guess I didn't realize
1271000	1281960	I was missing on my um on my consoles was like a really nice high definition 60 frames per second
1281960	1287080	experience and that's what I'm getting with these new games I don't I don't switch it to oh no I
1287080	1294440	don't switch Godfall into the pretty fancy ray tracing mode because it just chugs if you do that
1294440	1299880	but if you keep it on performance it's beautiful and really fast Spider-Man though super cool
1299880	1305880	looking at 60 frames a second but I keep it on the visual fidelity mode because it's really
1305880	1312360	really nice looking I can deal with 30 frames a second problem and Astrobot to me Astrobot is so
1312360	1318040	good I don't care if it's just like Playstation propaganda throughout the entire game it's such
1318040	1322440	a nostalgic trip for some of the things I've seen I love it I've heard a lot of good things
1322440	1327400	about Astro Boy considering you know I think most people are kind of I'm sorry Astrobot
1327400	1332840	Astro Boy is a different thing considering so many people were um like overlooking it as just
1332840	1336760	just kind of writing it off as oh the tech demo game that you know they're just kind of throwing
1336760	1340840	in there because it's cheap but it really seems like a lot of social media is really taking to
1340840	1346440	this game like no it is it's a strong game on its own just for like you're saying the nostalgia
1346440	1349880	features and being able to kind of show everything off like it's it seems like it's a much better
1349880	1355880	kind of deal than one two switch same oh yeah for sure and it really gets you acquainted with
1355880	1363640	the controller and all the things that are uh available to to uh be used for that fancy new
1363640	1370600	controller um we'll see if in even six months time if other games are taking advantage of it
1370600	1376680	Godfall didn't really feel that special um in terms of like fun controller things neither did
1376680	1385240	uh regular Spider-Man so uh we'll see maybe maybe more people will look to Astrobot now that it's
1385240	1391320	out more developers will and really see what they can do with that um just tell me if you have to
1391320	1396200	go by the way but um I I want to ask you this question kind of about the since I don't you know
1396200	1400680	you're kind of like our PlayStation 5 voice tonight what do you kind of think like do you
1400680	1407160	feel like this console is like a huge step up from the four like what is this like really bringing to
1407160	1416040	the table for you that's exciting so the load time and that's something I can like even speak
1416040	1422440	to on the Series X the load times make all the difference in the world it feels like for example
1422440	1428760	besides Astrobot probably the game I played most on the PS5 is Fuser um from Harmonix I
1428760	1434760	wondered when you were gonna bring that up yeah because these are so good um so I just downloaded
1434760	1439080	it all I was playing a little bit on PS4 when it launched then I was like screw it I'm not even
1439080	1447640	going to keep my PS4 out here anymore so let's just move everything to PS5 and just I can't
1447640	1454200	believe how I was sitting through load times before this these systems it's just I never
1454200	1462680	want load times again but the trade-off is at least for now I'm already onto like maybe 400
1463320	1470760	under 400 gigs left on my PS5 for storage space and that sucks that like Spider-Man both of them
1470760	1477560	together were already 100 gigs that's like almost under just under a seventh of the entire hard
1477560	1484920	drive that you get or no just under about a six yeah it sucks like I don't know what they need
1484920	1491320	to do I don't know what the industry needs to do to make these things cheaper but that's I guess
1491720	1499000	I guess beautiful graphics fast loading ridiculous face constraints that's what the new generation
1499000	1505800	feels like um at least we know the space stuff is upgradeable later on um if but it's kind of
1505800	1509480	expensive those I mean at least the official like solid state drives are kind of expensive
1509480	1513480	I mean a regular USB drive not so much but then you're missing that perk of the loading time which
1513480	1518440	yeah over on Series X which I'll talk about in a minute I'm definitely noticing like wow this
1518440	1522600	really changes things with the loading time it's pretty impressive I don't even have time to switch
1522600	1527960	to like the right input on my Series X before it's already up like I'll hit the button on the
1527960	1531960	controller to turn on the system and I hear the noise and then I reach for the remote and turn it
1531960	1537720	to the right input and it's already there it's instant it's pretty amazing um tell us quickly
1537720	1541240	before I let you go about about Fusor like what is it about that game you love so much
1542200	1549000	I love drop mix and Fusor is just drop mix without physical cards and you get to make a character
1549000	1557320	and you get a weird camp mode and it has like rhythm based mechanic like timing and it's so
1557320	1564760	much fun I just just hope it's not like I hope it gets supported for longer than six months
1564760	1570440	because that feels like the average harmonics game or even that might be stretching it um but
1570440	1576840	I already want more dlc I went all in on it got the big fancy pack uh I pre-ordered so I got three
1576840	1584440	more songs and literally uh you make like your own sort of deck thing your own box of different like
1584440	1590920	music cards and every single box I make like there's three songs I keep in there I don't care
1590920	1597560	if it has to be like if they're focusing on like uh rock music or if they're focusing this box on
1598200	1605640	uh rap and r&b and stuff like that or country like I always keep freaking ghosts and stuff
1606600	1615560	by deadmau5 and rob swire eyes by rufus soul and the other one keep in there oh where's your head
1615560	1621560	at my basement those three are always in every box I make because I refuse to let them go because I
1622360	1629880	I always throw the vocals on over uh with one of those songs I can't stop um are they gonna uh
1629880	1633960	I thought I was reading this might be a thing but let's say you wanted to so obviously shared play
1633960	1639160	is the thing in the sony universe if you wanted to share play your playstation 5 but I'm only
1639160	1645080	on playstation 4 am I going to be able to see that or does that not work interesting we'll have
1645080	1651640	to try it because I haven't tried any like I haven't really done a lot okay so here's how it
1651640	1658280	is oh I got two new fancy consoles what do I do last night I play pokemon it's just you know like
1658280	1663480	I'm sitting 15 feet away from them looking at them and I'm like oh but I should probably go shiny
1663480	1669160	in pokemon that's a good idea I get it though because like you know I have shiny new consoles
1669160	1674120	and we're still signing on to play final fantasy 14 and do dungeons so you know I will not put
1674120	1678840	that on my ps there is no space for that game yeah I'm good with keeping that on my computer
1679960	1684600	all right uh shane I know I I gotta let you go because you have another uh thing you gotta do
1684600	1688440	but um thanks sorry I know you had to sit there for a long time but uh we have a lot to say sorry
1688440	1696520	about it um but I'm sure we'll have you back again soon okay okay take care buddy bye all right um
1696520	1700840	so while I fix the camera settings here live on twitch um loki anything else you want to see on
1700920	1705560	the xbox because I had to cut you off a little bit sorry no it's fine so it's funny enough like
1705560	1710360	I was looking at uh some of the playstation 5 games that have come out like especially like
1710360	1718040	the footage of um spider-man miles morales and even like uh sack boy and um astro bots and stuff
1718040	1724040	kind of makes me want to playstation 5 but I'm certainly waiting until next year when um I don't
1724040	1730520	think they're gonna go down in price but when there's um more availability and maybe when
1730520	1739720	playstation vr2 gets announced or is coming out um so we'll see when that happens but um definitely
1739720	1745960	in the short run like I think there's more um interesting games on the launch end for
1745960	1751320	playstation 5 but the reason I picked an xbox series x is because I feel especially with all
1751320	1755320	these company acquisitions and bethesda and everything that there's gonna be a lot more games
1755960	1763000	exclusive games coming to the xbox side of things um it's definitely a game pass machine and that's
1763000	1768760	not a bad thing yeah yeah and what's cool though like too like with yakuza like say for example if
1768760	1774200	I don't want to have that on my uh like I feel that this game's kind of a grind fest I was like
1774200	1779480	man if I could really run this with like trainers and stuff on pc it'd be great and I can because
1779480	1786120	it's all cross by so I have it on pc too when I make a purchase on xbox um series x or on the
1786120	1793320	xbox marketplace so like I could essentially download it to my pc if I have not enough space
1793320	1799960	on my series x interesting um yeah because they've been doing the cross by thing for a little bit
1799960	1804200	because like I remember forza horizon on xbox one and there's been several titles on xbox one
1804200	1808520	a lot of especially like the real first party microsoft stuff was cross by and that's why
1808520	1813240	there's a lot of people that are like why do I need to get an xbox if I have a pc I don't need
1813240	1817800	to get which is fine sorry I shouldn't do a voice with that but for some people it's what I hear
1817800	1822280	because I feel like they're trying to take a dig at xbox but I realize some people have that very
1822280	1827080	measured approach to where it's like I've got a top of the line pc there's not really anything
1827080	1832120	micro the xbox going to do for me and I do kind of get that but like if you sign up for game pass
1832120	1837160	microsoft still got your money yeah I don't think they care whether you get a system or not I think
1837160	1841320	it's long as you're playing their games they don't really care and and that's the thing it's
1841320	1847160	like if you don't want to get you know an xbox series x right now maybe there's not something
1847160	1851960	that you want to play on it you can always get games pass or whatever and play their games and
1851960	1857320	they come out you don't have to pay any additional money for it so it's not too bad I honestly so
1857320	1862200	this is going to be a really weird statement but I'm gonna this is my early thought like and I I
1862200	1866600	think the series x is great I'm gonna get my impressions in a minute but I almost feel like
1867320	1872200	what game pass is bringing to the table and eventually what sony is going to have to respond
1872200	1876920	with their with their own you know playstation plus library sorry I always get the name wrong
1876920	1881000	of that but you know they're they're equivalent essentially I almost feel like the next generation
1881000	1886680	in some ways is more about that and the transition to that kind of ecosystem than necessarily about
1886680	1892680	more bigger graphics and ray tracing and okay the loading times yeah I mean that is that is certainly
1892680	1896840	a big difference but I almost feel like that other transition is going to be more representative of
1897400	1903640	what we went through in this generation from the last generation if that makes sense so all right
1903640	1909960	yeah so anyway um let me talk a little bit about my uh story with the series x so it actually is
1909960	1917080	a little bit interesting because um what ended up happening is that I got the um series x on
1917080	1923320	amazon I pre-ordered it there the day it went live for everybody and um I got that email on
1923320	1927800	monday that a lot of people got that said oh uh you're not going to be getting that console until
1927800	1933080	december 31st you know at some point until then some so I knew I wasn't going to be getting it
1933080	1939240	tuesday so um I was like crap I've got to go find somewhere that I can actually like try to
1939240	1944280	find one of these on shelves so shane said he heard that best buy and target were doing things
1944280	1950360	so he was on best buys website I was on target's website and I was able to get one long story short
1950360	1956040	at target so I went into a store and picked one up at target um and you could I had to go to the
1956040	1961880	other side of town to do it but I was I was like hey I got one whatever I'm good so that process
1961880	1966680	honestly was pretty easy um they didn't shrink wrap the box or anything they didn't even put it
1966680	1971240	in a bag they and there's no handle on that box so the dude just kind of brought it out was like here
1971240	1976920	you go and like handed me the box which I had to take take this xbox series x out to the parking
1976920	1983160	lot to my car like just no way to hide it but you're mugging yeah I know right thankfully it
1983160	1987880	was still light out and there's signs at target they're everywhere that are like security cameras
1987880	1994040	still in use uh that whole thing but I made it home um and again a big reason why I opted for
1994040	2002920	series x as opposed to playstation 5 is because I have a playstation 4 pro I don't have an xbox 1x
2002920	2008520	so I figured the jump from xbox one the xbox series x was going to be a bigger jump and I
2008520	2015720	really think I was right um so one of the games I've been playing a lot of on series x is no man
2015720	2021080	sky yep I never shut up about that game and I've started that game probably over like seven times
2021080	2026200	well guess what bitches I started my eighth playthrough thanks to a game pass and having
2026200	2034680	that on series x you will notice if you have xbox the new one if you go into the game pass library
2034680	2041720	it has a little icon in the corner that says enhanced for xbox series x or s has a little logo
2041720	2046040	for that so you can actually see the games and uh no man's sky of course is one of them we talked
2046040	2050840	about on last week's show that it was going to be getting that and um there's a bunch of others too
2050840	2056840	dead by daylight forza horizon the new ori game um and so forth so there's there's plenty of games
2056840	2063480	that have gotten the upgrades and did I notice the upgrades for no man's sky on series x um compared
2063480	2071560	to playstation 4 pro yes I did um it number one is the loading times my god like I used to have
2071560	2076200	to sit there for a minute and a half you know while it's loading into the galaxy in my plate
2076200	2081240	that now it's down to seconds it's like 20 seconds 30 seconds um something like that it's
2081240	2092840	it's crazy um and um I I notice the graphics um I I do notice a little bit of pop in um but I
2092840	2098120	noticed that on any of the consoles or I've I've noticed pop in on pc I just think it's part of how
2098120	2105080	the algorithm is in that game um but the thing that kind of strikes me is that I notice the high
2105080	2110600	definition textures even on things that are in the distance and that's probably the biggest thing
2110600	2115640	that I noticed playing on series x versus playing on any other system I've played on I've played
2115640	2121240	that game on a lot of systems um especially I will say I played no man's sky just a little bit
2121240	2128040	on xbox one when it first went to game pass it's it's garbage on the original xbox one compared to
2128040	2133400	what it is now like the game the game hasn't changed but the graphics like night and day
2133400	2140360	night and day it looks so much better so um I uh yeah I enjoy uh I enjoy I'm enjoying uh
2140360	2144760	no man's sky again I've probably dropped easily like 10 hours on the latest playthrough
2144760	2148920	I am blowing up my twitter with screenshots because that's one of my favorite things to do
2148920	2155240	in that game because I just like you know I people say no man's sky is kind of like minecraft and
2155240	2161720	there is it's it's definitely crafting is the backbone of the game um but minecraft to me
2161720	2166120	everything looks very samezy you're either overground you're underground you're in the
2166120	2170280	nether you know but there's only so many different environments that's the thing about no man's sky
2170280	2173720	that really strikes me is that every time you go to this new planet it's going to look a lot
2173720	2178440	different from where you were at before yes there's there's some basic types that they all
2178440	2183000	kind of fit into but there's definitely enough variety and enough rare stuff that happens to
2183000	2188680	kind of keep things exciting and that's that's part of why I really enjoy no man's sky um here's
2188680	2194920	the other interesting thing I noticed with series x though is that because I didn't do xbox 1x
2196120	2203240	there's some games that were already enhanced for xbox 1x that I kind of missed so I went to
2203240	2208440	go check some of those out too so some of the other games I played this week I played skyrim
2208440	2215000	the definitive edition whatever the they call the remaster one because alan is back into playing
2215000	2218840	that on pc so he's playing that a lot so I was like oh I'll download this to show it to him on
2218840	2225960	xbox and we were both kind of taken with wow this looks really good like you know it's like playing
2225960	2231080	max settings on a pc but it's on my tv and the frame rate very good like when you're looking
2231080	2235080	around and stuff that whole opening when you're in the back of the cart and everything sometimes
2235080	2238680	you know the frame rate could get a little weird there if you're looking around a lot of pop in on
2238680	2245240	the trees and stuff looks very fluid on the xbox series x you definitely notice it so I think
2245240	2249720	that's another thing that you know it's very similar to how if you're playing playstation
2249720	2255080	4 games on playstation 5 it's like oh like god of war is like 60 frames a second now like
2255080	2259640	everything's like running better a lot of that is happening with the xbox one games too I think
2259640	2265560	even on things they're not advertising our xbox series s or x the other one that I played a little
2265560	2276200	bit of that I was like wow this looks so good was final fantasy 15 and you know that game has
2276200	2283640	its pluses and it has its minuses but I will say it looks great in 4k um but you know I I that was
2283640	2288840	the first time I'd really gotten to play that in true 4k so um kind of interesting uh other games
2288840	2294280	I checked out on the series x this week uh I checked out tetris effect connected I did not
2294280	2300680	like that multiplayer is only restricted to ranked or play with friends so there's no casual
2300680	2306120	mode that's unranked I was a little disappointed in that otherwise it's um tetris effect without
2306120	2313160	the vr part which is still a great game and worth uh you taking a look at if you have a game pass or
2313160	2318520	what have you um and then forza horizon 4 I looked at briefly for a little bit and of course that
2318520	2323880	game looks great too and it's just one of those things where how fast that game moves that game
2324040	2329240	moves so fast and it looks so good while it's doing it so I I definitely am noticing like
2329880	2336520	the fluid like you get more constant 60 frames a second things look really good in the distance
2336520	2342600	as well as they do close up I am noticing some of those like subtleties in this new generation but
2342600	2349720	are the games themselves different yet well no because most of the launch games are all bumped
2349720	2355240	back especially on the xbox side we barely got anything on the xbox side you got the yakuza you
2355240	2361960	got assassin's creed and stuff but nothing that really feels distinctly next generation and I'm
2361960	2366440	imagining it not until the new halo game or something really strong first party or really
2366440	2372200	going to see that but that being said I'm very I'm very happy with the xbox series x it's like
2372200	2377080	getting a brand new video card in the computer and a new chip and like getting that upgrade that
2377080	2380760	really gives it a kick in the pants and now you want to go back and play all your old favorites
2380760	2385640	to see how smooth they run again it's very that and that's that phase we're in right now while we
2385640	2392760	wait for these other big launch titles so um some comments from chat I'm sorry I've been ignoring
2392760	2397800	you guys um Bobby Blackwell says yeah I've been playing Final Fantasy 15 on my xbox 1x and it's
2397800	2405080	beautiful um let's see uh bonds 006 says I'm playing Tetris Effect with a girlfriend on xbox
2405080	2409960	she will learn the ways of Tetris well Tetris is for for everybody boys and girls and
2409960	2417640	everything uh all the peoples um let's see um sj100 matt says I'm really getting a series x
2417640	2422360	first to play game pass and at some point cyberpunk I will be getting uh enjoying
2422360	2427480	forest horizon 4 when I eventually do get my series x which will be some time week of thanksgiving
2428440	2434280	um act def says which of these will rob end up with more of no man's sky playthroughs or copies
2434280	2439320	of mass effect 3 uh this would be like my eighth no man's sky playthrough but it's not my eighth
2439320	2444680	copy of no man's sky uh it's just I've started a new playthrough every time they do a big patch so
2444680	2449400	I think no man's sky is gonna have a beat Bobby Blackwell says I think no man's sky also got a
2449400	2455720	playstation 5 upgrade yes it did uh and I would fully expect all the nice things I said about
2455720	2460440	xbox excuse me all the nice things I said about no man's sky on xbox series x are probably going
2460440	2466040	to apply to the playstation 5 as well and anybody jumping up from an original playstation 4 version
2466040	2473000	I'm I'm fairly positive you're going to think all those same things um so there is that um
2473880	2479960	I will say I've noticed a few bugs in no man's sky I tweeted one of them I died instantly on
2479960	2485640	loading one of my saves that was a bummer but you know things happen um and uh sometimes when the
2485640	2490600	aliens tend to hold objects or they're talking to you and the objects kind of vibrate and shake
2490600	2495880	and move everywhere like they're not staying in one place um I feel like these are things that
2495880	2501000	we're gonna see a patch from hello games in a week or two the only thing that broke the game was that
2501000	2507480	loading bug and I feel like that may not be I feel like that may just happen in that game and it may
2507480	2513800	not be exclusive to an xbox thing I feel like you can probably get that on pc honestly so there is
2513800	2519880	that um okay um I think that's pretty much all I need to say on my gaming week uh Loki any anything
2519880	2525800	else on the xbox that I missed no not really I can't think of anything are you happy with your
2525800	2531640	purchase so far do you think are you glad you got one now um yeah I'm happy that I got it I'm gonna
2531640	2537000	be really happy once cyberpunk comes out even though I already have it purchased on pc um I'll
2537000	2543400	get it twice I guess um I don't know I mean I probably didn't need it right away but
2544760	2550840	you know it's it's better just to get it now and then instead of trying to fight to get it later
2550840	2556600	on I guess all right well let's see if anybody wants to add anything to their gaming weeks outside
2556600	2562200	of these new consoles so dark soccer I'll start with you because I'm sure your gaming oh you just
2562280	2570200	popped up you good to go okay uh and you just I didn't you might be muted still but um how was
2570200	2576040	your oh there you go okay how was your gaming week dark soccer outside of new consoles well we
2576040	2582120	picked up a thing for um Dan's birthday that's a new console oh what but I'm not talking about it
2582120	2589800	yet okay I have a story about it later uh oh okay I know where this is going okay okay got it a
2589800	2597480	thing that ign ranked above the xbox and the playstation 5 okay I'm curious all right we'll
2597480	2604280	talk about that in a minute then yeah so I so I actually played some of it today uh again that
2604280	2612680	will come up later um I played a little bit of pinball um it's been kind of hard to play anything
2612680	2617160	else and playing animal crossing we just had our driveway done so it was really loud outside and I
2617160	2622120	could hardly hear anything and on top of that anytime I tried to play something that like would
2622120	2628840	get me excited um well my heart would start racing really badly and I would almost have
2628840	2635160	an asthma attack so I'm keeping it calm just keeping it calm lots of wordscapes and lots of
2635160	2639560	animal crossing and a little bit of pinball but you know it gets the heart racing a bit much
2639560	2645640	is it was basically coming off of the prednisone anything that I was playing that would kind of you
2645640	2651080	know kick me up into into overdrive would uh get my heart rate racing too fast because the
2651080	2658280	prednisone so now that I'm off of it I can play some stuff again so yay no scary games for a
2658280	2663560	little bit oh no scary games are fine because they don't really scare me it's just things that are
2663560	2672840	more like actiony you know okay so um but uh I've uh I've got a few few things coming up on my plate
2672920	2678360	and I'm finally once uh all of this is behind me I'm gonna do my charity stream
2678360	2685160	so you get to see uh I think that um dream daddy went out on my pole
2686840	2694040	so I'm gonna gonna get me a daddy let's see which daddy I go for might get myself a nice bear
2694040	2699640	oh it's not the first time I've heard that all right probably not from an ace girl
2700600	2704440	uh loki anything you wanted to add to your gaming week outside of the new stuff
2705160	2709560	um well just you know I did like I said I did play a little bit of Minecraft I played a lot
2709560	2718120	more Minecraft though on pc and I was working on our realm that um myself and my kids have so I was
2718120	2725080	finishing up this giant roller coaster with like tons of redstone stuff in it um so I finished up
2725160	2730680	the actual like coaster part of that still need to decorate it but it's our our giant um
2731480	2736520	creeper mine type roller coaster thing it's kind of fun because we actually have like a creeper in
2736520	2740200	a minecart that we have triggered to go at certain times so you see him like zoom by
2740200	2744360	if I have to add some more of that stuff in there have to probably shoot some video for it at some
2744360	2751000	point and then also uh my youngest son wanted me to play egg wards with him on one of the
2751000	2757080	Minecraft servers out there so I tried that today as well and unfortunately it's hard to play with
2757080	2762680	people that you don't know that there's no strategy or anything and no one's talking
2762680	2767640	and everybody's just kind of doing their own thing or just idling there so that was fun um
2768200	2775320	but yeah he was really excited about it so oh and Orna played more Orna yep that's about it yeah I
2775320	2779320	don't think I have a lot to add to my gaming week outside of the consoles except you know continuing
2779320	2784760	my uh my paladin in final fantasy 14 hit 80 so there's another class at 80. I will say to answer
2784760	2790680	act f's earlier question I have more jobs at max level in final fantasy 14 than I do playthroughs
2790680	2795480	of no man's sky if you want to know the game I really play too much of there's your answer there
2795480	2799320	but I also did a live stream of that earlier this week because I was like I haven't done a stream in
2799320	2807160	a long time um my some aspects of my mental health are actually improving um I can't imagine why um
2807160	2811800	but I was in a place where I felt like I could I could do a stream earlier this week so I did
2811800	2818200	um and uh yeah it felt pretty good I'll have to do more I I've been directly asked on twitter by
2818200	2823960	multiple people if I will do no man's sky on the xbox series x as a stream yes I just don't know
2823960	2829880	what night yet so um stay tuned for that on my personal channel at rob roberts um and then uh
2830840	2837080	you know kind of the gps stuff um I'm a little irritated with the niantic gps stuff but I'm
2837080	2840520	gonna save that for another week I want to I want to marinate on that and see how I feel in seven
2840520	2847560	days um but I have been playing orna still so that's um that's pretty good so yeah um I'm
2847560	2852680	looking for other suggestions of gps games that I haven't like I I thought I was on top of all of
2852680	2857400	them but I think there's some that I've missed out on so um I I was writing a tweet about that
2857400	2861960	so I'm kind of curious if I might discover anything new this week we'll see so uh yeah
2861960	2866600	act deaf to chat says that's true final fantasy 14 is the game you're always playing yes that is
2866600	2871800	very true but it's kind of the social element of that game for sure but a lot of people like for
2871800	2876440	some people call of duty is that game because they get online with their friends and play that game
2876440	2881400	for some people um destiny is that game because they get online or destiny 2 whatever get online
2881400	2884680	and play you know what I mean a lot of people have that kind of game that their friends get
2884680	2890360	together and play for some people um it's dungeons and dragons you know before the
2890360	2894680	pandemic people were getting together and playing dnd during the pandemic they're doing it on zoom
2894680	2899320	you know and other alternative board game types of things so there's always game night for something
2899320	2903400	to run a game what's that I'm just looking for someone to run a game for me to be in
2904200	2909800	oh you should you should run second edition for me you should uh get a podcast type thing
2909800	2916280	together dm I'm a shitty dm no no but you don't have to dm it you can be the one that records it
2916280	2921400	and publishes it if you want but I need someone to run it and I need someone to run second edition
2921400	2926840	dnd for me all right well y'all y'all heard her y'all heard dark soccer's request get in touch
2926840	2932120	with her on twitter you're a twitter person now you you weren't using the site very much at all
2932120	2936920	for a long time and now just in the past few months your twitter's been on fire I'm pretty
2936920	2942680	exclusive on it now I mean I need like this is a stupid ego thing but I really wish that I had
2942680	2948120	like the eight more followers to hit a thousand because I did ignore it for a while you know yeah
2948120	2954120	and now I've got two of them don't forget I have gen x geeks because of course my blog and which
2954120	2960440	my blog is actually I feel like it's starting to to do better I found my flow on it oh good so um
2960440	2966920	but but I mean yeah okay so you have two twitter accounts on your phone
2967720	2972920	do you know how do you know how many I have I have this I'm just showing it from a distance
2972920	2979800	I have one so I have my okay one two three four five six seven eight nine I have nine accounts
2979800	2985960	on my phone nine twitter accounts because yeah and no there's no after dark alt we're gonna rule
2985960	2993160	that out right now that is not one of them okay but I have me olr horde house I haven't used this
2993160	2999960	in 2014 uh my very secret day job twitter account that nobody knows about nobody's going to know
2999960	3005240	about that is not an invitation to go find it um because that is that is me separating day and
3005240	3012680	night stuff vog network guys on a show reading his fundamental podcast pokey stop podcast and shaking
3012760	3016840	and crying I have nine twitter accounts now granted I only use maybe three of those
3016840	3023720	with any regularity anymore but it's just funny so soon soon you'll have more of them because I mean
3024520	3029080	I made one for the sisters a long ass time ago I had like another personal one that
3029080	3034360	was going to be super private that I never used and I had lady 99 for a while when I was doing my
3034360	3040760	sort of uh protest stuff and I just said fuck it I'll just be public about my protesting gotcha
3041400	3046200	so I mean I've got I've got maybe about that many just that I've had for different purposes
3046200	3053800	and different organizations that I'm in but right now I'm focusing on those two because um I want
3053800	3061080	to have something dedicated for my blog um and then um something that's just like my thing that
3061080	3068680	I can complain at everybody about and uh get overwhelmed with people posting about
3068680	3075480	chipping on supernatural I've noticed a lot of supernatural chat on your twitter this week but
3075480	3080360	I get it because the show I know is winding down and hey you know what Stacey Abrams is talking
3080360	3085560	about supernatural on her twitter so you're in good company oh yeah no that's cool she's been
3085560	3092520	getting some love from the cast uh as well um and I've actually been I've had a couple of just
3092520	3096520	little quick chats with with some of the some of the folks who do some good things I've actually
3096520	3100040	really started getting involved I know this is completely different started getting involved
3100040	3108120	with random acts.org um that uh some of the people who have been or associated with the cast um
3108120	3113080	organized for doing basically good charity work but also just encouraging everyone to be a little
3113080	3119160	kinder so be kind and run me a dnd game well I I have lots of kind things I could say about Stacey
3119160	3123800	Abrams I'm not even going to make it a political thing I mean yes I I love her politics but just
3123800	3128280	even outside of that and even if you are you know in a different political mind
3128280	3134440	spot I will say I love the fact that she is like an out nerd in politics and she's very you know
3134440	3138280	she talks about supernatural did you see that video where she was ranking all the star tracks
3138280	3145480	and she wasn't sitting there going well I always like she like she had her facts she's like I like
3145480	3151080	this one because of this story and what it does is I was like okay okay not not that anyone should
3151080	3156360	ever have to prove I wasn't top on there though I don't want to hear it ds9 was not top sorry
3156360	3163160	uh what did she put on top maybe she did no no she put voyager on top because I was like yes
3163160	3169320	yes me too I was like I that's another reason I love her she put voyager on top
3170200	3175720	voyager wasn't didn't deserve the bad rap that it got yeah I I still say deep space nine is the
3175720	3180280	best of them all yeah but no I mean she she not and I was gonna say not that anyone should ever
3180280	3187240	have to prove her fandom but there is something extra special about the fact that she had like she
3187240	3192600	had deep answers anyway I'm sorry this isn't the Stacey Abrams fan club podcast I mean it could be
3192600	3198200	but it's uh it's OLR let's talk about other video games uh anything else for our gaming weeks I
3198200	3203320	think we got it all out let's then move on to some news there's been a lot that's been going on in
3203320	3209800	the news um about new consoles and other stuff as well right Loki uh yes so of course more
3209880	3213640	information coming out about the consoles and what they support and don't support
3213640	3219720	so one bit of um information that we have is right now the playstation 5 doesn't support
3220280	3226840	1440p resolutions so if you have a monitor that's 1440p well you're just gonna have to play it at
3226840	3231640	1080p instead um which is unfortunate because I know a lot of people that are getting high
3231640	3237560	refresh rate monitors may only be able to get 1440p like the one I got right now I was hoping
3237560	3244360	to get an hdmi 2.1 because that's what all these new consoles are um but there aren't any monitors
3244360	3250360	or hdmi 2.1 right now so that's basically what you need to be able to do 120 frames per second
3250360	3259880	and 4k at the same time so now I can only do 4k and 60 fps or I could do 1440p at 120 so that's
3259880	3266040	kind of what I'm sticking with at least on the Xbox side but the Xbox series x does support 1440p
3266040	3273400	so that's always good um now whether that may be coming to the playstation 5 later possibly because
3273400	3281640	right now according to the VP of platform management uh Hideki Nishino basically said that
3281640	3287240	they wanted to prioritize tv support that's why that 1440p isn't currently supported because
3287240	3295800	that's mainly a monitor format and not a tv um but later on there's um no reason no technical reasons
3295800	3301240	to be able to support that later on so that may be something that's coming if demand um requires
3301240	3308360	it to um along with that there are some issues with some of the games that are backwards
3308360	3314760	compatible that may have um problems playing now we talked about last week how there are some of
3314760	3322760	the assassins creed games that were not being supported 100 and actually one of those assassins
3322760	3328840	creed syndicate I believe is one of those that does have an issue playing it does actually run
3328840	3336280	but their shadows are kind of like strobing a bit it's all glitched out but up the 4000 plus titles
3336280	3344200	that are backwards compatible they said about 115 of those are tagged as um you may experience game
3344200	3349160	behavior or unexpected game behavior while playing this playstation 4 game on your ps5 console
3349160	3354120	so is that why ubisoft had it remember that story a couple weeks ago and we were like
3354120	3358280	maybe ubisoft wasn't running the same version emulator at least that was my theory and ubisoft
3358280	3362680	outed all these games it's not backwards compatible and they pulled it so it sounds
3362680	3369480	like there may have been some like a truthiness in that because okay assassins creed is backwards
3369480	3375640	compatible but or syndicate specifically is backwards compatible but it's got some flaws
3376360	3381560	yeah like for example they talked about some of the other um annoyances that you may run into grip
3381560	3388200	for example you can um it says that there's issues but nothing's really been noticeable
3388200	3394040	everybody's golf there's some flick you're a flickering scenery graphics mainly the trees
3394040	3399960	it could be like how that stuff is being rendered and certain engines um and emulators even going
3400360	3406120	back to like nes emulators have had this issue like um i remember castlevania 3
3406760	3412360	the vertical scrolling levels were the biggest pain to get emulated for the longest time
3412360	3417560	because they're the way those were being kind of like done was very different and the emulators
3417560	3422520	didn't know how to do it so if you tried to play castlevania 3 early on back in my day in the nes
3422520	3427640	emulator days this was college so yes i was using emulators and playing all sorts of stuff in them
3427640	3432760	um but like you couldn't get past you know the like second part of the first level of
3432760	3437720	castlevania 3 because it was a vertical scrolling part anyway just it's just emulators have always
3437720	3442440	had these problems because they're emulating they're not perfectly the hardware right so
3442440	3448200	just you know um keep in mind that you know you may run into some issues they have a backwards
3448200	3454760	compatibility page that talks about um some of the issues that you may run into but you know it's
3454760	3460600	it's not to say that they are always going to be broken it could be that they fix them down the
3460600	3467000	line but at launch i mean four thousand out of you know um and only having like a hundred of
3467000	3479800	those kind of broken that's not bad so um yeah and then on top of that though um i i don't know if
3479960	3485160	anyone's really asked the question about region locking but apparently the playstation 5 games
3485160	3490200	are also going to be region free which i believe it was the same with the playstation 4 i i'm kind
3490200	3497880	of glad that we've moved past the whole region locking with video games um so hopefully that
3497880	3505720	stays the same but yeah apparently it is been confirmed via their faq's that yes it is still
3505720	3513640	region free so that's good i would assume though the same might not be able to be said about
3513640	3521160	uh all uh placey or i should say uh 4k blu-rays i'm not sure if those are still region locked
3521160	3524600	but at least the games themselves are not
3524600	3537400	hmm how where so i mean region locking thing thing of the past right well yeah we haven't
3537400	3546040	really seen it since uh the playstation 3 i think um on sony side yes nintendo
3547080	3553480	i think 3d wasn't 3ds or ds i feel like it was more recent on the xbox no the xbox 360 was
3554280	3561400	region locked the playstation 3 i cannot remember if that was region locked the thing maybe there
3561400	3567160	might have been some games that were some that weren't um nintendo side i want to say
3569000	3576840	probably the wii u i know that their cartridge games weren't but i don't know if the wii u discs
3576840	3585960	were region locked um obviously i don't think the switch games are but i know 3ds and nintendo ds
3585960	3594760	games were not locked all right well um let's move on then and let's oh actually let me get
3594760	3599320	some quick chat messages here because uh bobby blackwolf says uh note that there's no dolby
3599320	3605000	vision or atmos in playstation 5 and there never will be it seems um he does say it going to say
3605000	3609960	though that 4k uhd blu-rays will pass through fine if you turn on bitstream audio output in
3609960	3614920	the dvd player settings menu and that has to do with a like a licensing thing for that technology
3614920	3621080	probably right i'm assuming well yeah because i know with atmos like i have my headphones i'm
3621080	3630280	wearing right now actually are adobe atmos um and i had to download the app because i had to do that
3630280	3637640	on pc as well i download the app um and put in a serial number that i got with my headphones
3637640	3644760	to be able to use the atmos part of that or the seven one surround sound um but yeah i did the
3644760	3649400	same thing on the series x thankfully it worked without having any troubles like because i was
3649400	3654920	like oh no enter a serial number i don't have that anymore um but thankfully because i purchased it
3654920	3663000	on pc that it remembered it all right well moving on let's talk about something that was all over
3663000	3666760	social media earlier this week when it was happening because this was unfortunately one
3666760	3671320	of those things that was kind of playing out live um and you know that can be both a good thing and
3671320	3677160	a bad thing um good because you can follow along but bad because a lot of stuff kind of gets thrown
3677160	3682120	in that isn't necessarily true and that is the situation that happened with ubisoft montreal
3682840	3689160	earlier this week um a couple days ago uh in the afternoon uh there was a really scary situation
3689160	3694120	that happened there um that uh there was talk on social media about oh my gosh there's like an
3694120	3698760	armed gunman that went into the building and was shooting and all of this well yes and that's the
3698760	3703640	part that social media thankfully got incorrect apparently that was the type of thing that had
3703640	3708600	been called in however the whole thing if you hadn't heard by this point it ended up being a
3708600	3714600	fake 911 call that triggered all these events that happened on friday um so there was a bunch
3714600	3718200	of stuff that was uploaded to twitter and that's why all this kind of like you know talk about what
3718200	3724440	was going on um had happened from um so yeah some folks had been working from home because uh you
3724440	3729080	know the pandemic some were still in the office so some people were tweeting like i know those
3729080	3735080	people on the roof because those are you know my co-workers and stuff um it was it was unfortunately
3735320	3741000	a fake 911 call that appears to be some type of swatting event um that happened which definitely
3741000	3746680	just makes us go like uh it's just it's kind of just disgusting that these swatting events still
3746680	3754840	happen um you know and why was ubisoft montreal targeted um it is very easy to tie that to gaming
3754840	3759960	culture because we've seen the swatting thing happen with you know twitch streams and and
3760040	3766840	things of that sort um and you know it's it's i i shouldn't make that assumption that it's because
3766840	3771400	they're a gaming company and somebody was upset about games that they did this unfortunately
3772280	3779320	track record kind of makes that a safe assumption that it probably was some type of weird
3779960	3785320	somebody trying to prove a point um and you might look at this and go well nobody was hurt
3785320	3789720	um uh do you know the psychological trauma this type of shit can put on people
3790360	3794840	seriously like read the accounts of some people who have gone through this on their social media
3794840	3800360	and stuff like this um there was definitely damage done so this is not an ever oh nobody got hurt
3800360	3805400	hahaha type of situation um when you do this type of swatting stuff i i know i appreciate the choir
3805400	3809320	here with this audience and you guys that are tuning in here are decent enough to know this
3809320	3815400	but i'm gonna say it anyway um you know when you're doing that swatting stuff to you know
3815400	3819480	haha get a rise out of people you are hurting you're intending to hurt and harm people
3819480	3825240	and it's about time that the law really caught up with that and had some really severe punishments
3825240	3832360	um on a on a on a national or at least state level scale um of how that's dealt with now
3833240	3837720	because i'm sure somebody will jump in there and say oh this happened in canada um
3838120	3844680	again i don't i don't know how to eloquently phrase this um but if i am to make any sort of
3844680	3850200	lemonade out of the the lemons that is this news the fact that it happened in canada makes me go
3850200	3855240	well maybe somebody will do something about this swatting thing now you know maybe something will
3855240	3860200	happen from the canadian government to really take a look at this issue how it happened why
3860200	3866760	it happened and look at never making it happen again and then hopefully the u.s can you know
3867400	3871560	use it as a blueprint and other countries too we don't want to just you know focus on north america
3871560	3878280	but this this swatting shit is dangerous and it has to stop um and um yeah i don't know what
3878280	3885800	else to say about that anybody want to add to that i can go to our chat too um act efton chat says uh
3885800	3890600	we know that ubisoft isn't the best company out there but this shouldn't happen to anyone at all
3890680	3897480	yeah no the the reputation and all that stuff if if this had happened to ea comcast
3897480	3902040	whatever like worst company you can think of i would say the exact same thing this is unacceptable
3902040	3908200	period um no one special 77 says plus since the police were tied up in a fake call that was fewer
3908200	3912440	cops that were unavailable for a legit call and in a legit situation where cops weren't there
3912440	3918600	folks could have been easily hurt um you know say a car accident had happened where people were
3918600	3923480	seriously injured somewhere you know you're right that takes police away from the availability to
3923480	3932040	do something like that um so it's um it's gross pod culture says even evil g even evil g absolutely
3932040	3940440	anybody anybody meant anybody so anyway it's an attempt for a party to show power over another
3940440	3947880	party and really it's not just for the recipient um you know who is uh definitely going to be
3947880	3953800	suffering um you know trauma from this but the person themselves it's indicative of serious uh
3953800	3960200	mental health problems that need to be addressed and people have died from it yeah oh yeah oh yeah
3960200	3964760	yeah we heard about the guy that got shot it was horrible it was like the neighbor or something i
3964760	3970840	don't know but it was it was horrible i'm sure that wasn't the only one it's so anyway sorry
3970840	3976200	i don't mean to drag things down i mean at least we can say okay at least it wasn't a shooting
3976200	3982040	situation but it's it's not really honest is it it's not right down yeah it's not really good news
3983000	3990280	so anyway not all news is good it doesn't have to be yeah so the the news doesn't care how it
3990280	3995720	makes you feel it's true the news is news just like science is science no matter what you believe
3995720	4002360	that's true so i'm gonna i'm gonna hope this had nothing to do with gaming culture but i'm gonna
4002360	4010040	know in the back of my mind i'm wrong and it is so anyway we'll see we'll see let's move on how
4010040	4014520	about something that is good news dark soccer how about something a little more light-hearted well
4014520	4020200	this is what i was referring to earlier um my husband's birthday is coming up a couple of days
4020200	4026920	after thanksgiving um we often have to deal with this and i've been racking my brain what am i
4026920	4030760	gonna get him what am i gonna get him and he's like i found myself something and i bought it
4030760	4041160	for myself from you for my birthday okay thanks oops so we have the uh the game and watch handheld
4041160	4051400	the new one um it is basically um in the semblance of the old game and watch it actually isn't
4051400	4058360	doesn't feel as as hefty as an old game and watch you know um but it's got like the color scheme
4058360	4069480	the branding and everything on it but it comes with um a uh uh built-in uh uh lcd screen um
4069480	4075080	that uh hat that will play three different games uh one of them is of course super mario brothers
4075080	4079080	um i had to get i had to like re-familiarize myself with the controller because it feels
4079080	4083400	different than playing it with the nes controller um and then there's super mario brothers 2 which
4083400	4088440	as we know it is lost levels which is basically the i bet you want to cry while playing mario
4088440	4097640	the game um and then the um uh there's ball you remember ball it was i believe the first game and
4097640	4105720	watch game um that uh i don't know i said lcd going back it was the the juggling game with
4105720	4109480	the balls but this time it's got mario's face on it although honestly it looks more like luigi but
4110040	4113880	does it the way they have like the little plates or something like that it's kind of moving back
4113880	4117960	and forth and the different okay it's just little balls and you get them from hand to hand yeah
4117960	4122520	well to be to be honest it is one of the easter eggs but there is a way to get luigi and ball
4122520	4129320	anyway yeah there there's actually video now that shows uh every one of the easter eggs including
4129320	4137000	the uh the image galleries and uh uh the oshi screen and how to you know get a warp pipe and
4137000	4142360	everything and the bowser fights um but at any rate because it is a game and watch it also has
4142360	4149160	the clock built in and the clock has different uh super mario brothers uh scenery uh playing through
4149160	4155720	it i don't know why why is then i'm just sorry i got like a little tongue tied for a moment
4155720	4161080	but basically um you know the time gives you the super mario theme clock and it kind of ticks along
4161080	4167720	with it um and it changes from day to night um with the with the you know with the hours
4168440	4174280	um and is that something that's kind of just meant to be running like on your shelf full time
4175240	4179720	since they have like the clock thing okay well was your was your game and watch meant to run
4179720	4186760	all the time no but it's been 30 years yeah but the with the game and watch is you know if you
4187480	4193160	didn't have a watch with you you could use the watch on your game and watch
4194360	4203480	oh okay i see the game and a watch but at any rate um you know i'm going to say this you know
4203480	4210680	it's it's it's neat you know it actually is a fun little nod it's definitely a novelty sort of thing
4211320	4217160	um and i still thought it was hilarious that ign ranked it higher than the uh
4217800	4223800	than the ps5 and the xbox um why did they do that besides for clicks why what was their
4223800	4231640	what was their justification in that i think fun factor okay yeah but at any at any rate you know
4231640	4236520	it's a really cool little thing it's got some nods you can look at it you know it's it's fun
4236600	4241240	you can play super mario brothers the screen is bigger than the gameboy micro so i mean hey
4241960	4249880	um it honestly though and this is just me um maybe it felt like it was
4251320	4257400	that was a good word for it i guess not super hefty does that make sense yeah like it felt
4257400	4265640	really lightweight i'm not gonna say cheap but it did feel really lightweight and the uh
4266600	4272760	you know the the buttons were you know light everything was just light about it um and and
4272760	4278360	i mean it is pretty much a a gimmick it's a fun gimmick but honestly i kind of want one of those
4278360	4283640	little game gears more than this but dan wanted this and dan got this and it's his birthday so
4283640	4289640	what i want doesn't matter um but i think it is uh pretty pretty cool i'm waiting to see what
4289640	4294440	the hackers do to it you know it's funny you bring that up because bob coffee and chat says
4294440	4298920	it'll be interesting to see if someone hacks it to play other nes games my understanding is and
4298920	4303560	i said it already was yeah i was gonna say i think i saw this on our discord over at vog
4303560	4309240	network.com slash discord i think that's where i saw it um somebody had um posted that it already
4309240	4315320	has been somebody got the like a hacked mario rom on there that actually will show the message hacked
4316280	4322520	so um it's happening i wasn't even looking at chat until you said that bob coffee said something
4322520	4329640	yeah but um but i mean um it's it's a really neat little thing you know i'm glad i'm glad we have it
4329640	4337000	you know it's it's really cute and it's definitely you know we're we're sort of stuck in our hardcore
4337000	4342120	nintendo uh fandomism right now you know i mean dan just the other day says i don't want another
4342120	4348600	system that isn't a nintendo system i'm like oh yeah same kind of right now but and so he
4348600	4355080	was right the next system he bought was a nintendo system a little gimmicky tiny nintendo system but
4355080	4360280	it's cute and it's great and it's a little fun thing and it was kind of fun playing super mario
4360280	4364440	brothers on a game and watch you know even though it's not quite the same size as an old game and
4364440	4371160	watch but um but yeah that's cool and you know if you want you know just something kind of fun to
4371160	4377880	have on the go with a little nostalgia i mean you could do worse yeah i have to admit i totally
4377880	4382600	forgot that that thing was even coming out with you know all the hysteria around the new consoles
4382600	4387000	and trying to order them until i saw like a couple of people on twitter were posting their pictures
4387000	4391320	in the box saying look what i got instead and this is kind of like the same type of thing i'm like oh
4391320	4398280	yeah nintendo was launching a console this week too uh i'll put a picture on my twitter but um
4398280	4402680	yeah i mean in in all kidding aside about nintendo's big console entry into the next
4402680	4407720	generation uh i obviously the switch is still gonna sell like crazy this this holiday because
4408040	4412920	not only is it the switch but it's got a pretty robust library of games so there's still going
4412920	4417160	to be an audience of people that you're going to want to play things like uh breath of the wild
4417160	4422200	mario kart and so forth and now of course the mario kart live as we've seen is is going to
4422200	4427400	probably be a big toy that a lot of kids want and so forth so um yeah and then the game and watch
4427400	4432360	is a nice little entry to the collectibles um kind of interesting to see that that's where nintendo
4432360	4438600	is going from the nes classic and the snes classic everybody was like where's the 64
4438600	4443080	classic or the game boy classic well we got a game and watch classic which maybe isn't
4443080	4449080	on the top of people's lists but it's maybe something to hold us over for another year or
4449080	4454760	two until one of those other things we talked about are going so thinking that they're really
4454760	4462600	trying to use that nostalgia to bank of course it's almost like and maybe i'm a little bit off
4462600	4466920	base on this one but i'm wondering if it's sort of like nintendo's fundraising right now
4468280	4475080	um well no we just i i think our show got cut off right before this story came up last week but we
4475080	4479480	did have a story on the list about how the switch no i think you might have got to it i don't
4479480	4486360	remember but there was a story about how the switch has outsold the nes already yeah we we
4486360	4491960	were about to get cut off so i just threw it in okay yeah so um that that whole thing was was
4491960	4497480	there so the switch is still selling like crazy so i don't think they need to fundraise but certainly
4497480	4502840	there's going to be the question of well we are a publicly traded company how can we make our
4502840	4510040	investors more money and that's the answer more money if if they did a kirby one i would buy it
4511480	4517560	they'd have to have like a lot of kirby games on it i just want the the the game in kirby um tiger
4517560	4521560	claw and chat says you think they'll do another game and watch of another game um and orange
4521560	4525640	right echoes the kirby answer but also says i think they're definitely going to make more game
4525640	4531800	and watches isn't a major zelda anniversary coming up yes i believe next year would be 30
4531800	4536760	because this year is 35 for mario right so next year's 35 for zelda or something like that i could
4536760	4542680	i could be off but um i i think uh yeah zelda's zelda's coming up and i wouldn't i wouldn't be
4542680	4547400	surprised though honestly you know what they want to release for zelda's 35th anniversary
4548040	4553160	breath of the wild 2 that's probably going to be next holiday's game and i i think
4553160	4560680	that that's plenty big enough of a zelda anniversary treat so yeah all right well
4560680	4566360	anyhow let's move on we have more stories and uh loki a big one in gaming culture right now right
4566360	4574120	oh yes fun times when we when we're talking about the um the rights of music industry
4574120	4581720	or music holders so the ria and mpa um so anyways twitch you may remember they had
4581720	4590040	a whole dmca fiasco where they were um taking down people's channels um because they had
4590680	4597080	you know copyrighted music in their clips and of course they had really terrible tools for um not
4597080	4603480	even necessarily identifying which you know video you may have had that had that but basically kind
4603480	4610520	of like this nuclear delete everything option was one of the ways to go or you know you could
4610520	4616920	possibly face you know copyright strikes and your channel being deleted so it's really it was only
4616920	4623640	like a mass deletion tool and they only really gave folks you know a few days notice about that
4623640	4631080	so of course they came out and apologized you know saying you know it's basically you know we
4631080	4636280	understand that you're rightly upset with the only option we provided was a mass deletion tool for
4636280	4640360	clips and that we only gave you three days notice to use this tool we could have developed more
4640360	4648680	sophisticated user-friendly tools a while ago that we didn't is on us yeah no kidding you think you
4648680	4654440	live in the same universe that youtube's in you see all the stories about how you know all the
4654440	4660200	copyright stuff they have to go through and you thought that sucks for them and not thinking at
4660200	4666680	all about your own company it's kind of stupid and so of course they said it that was a mistake
4666680	4671480	is or um and we could have provided creators with a longer time period to address their vod and clip
4671480	4675960	libraries that was a miss as well we're truly sorry for these mistakes and we'll do better
4677240	4680760	except you know they're not because that's never going to be the case it's never going to be the
4680760	4686840	end so of course what's going on now well the same stuff you normally see on youtube so for example
4687480	4695800	there was um someone by the name of um makal ronan who said that they had only music they've
4695800	4702360	had on their streams was in-game world of warcraft music played by the game itself yet they've got
4702360	4710680	muted audio on their latest vod because apparently in senjin village um there is the copyrighted
4710680	4717640	music banger called medium windstorm with gus whistles and low rumble from sound effects from
4717640	4722440	hollywood edge sound effects library first off i don't think that those should ever be part of the
4722440	4732440	copyright dmca you know system anyways it's sound effects especially if well okay i i i don't want
4732440	4740200	to spoil but i have to say there is another story in the news this week that is exactly this
4741480	4745640	and for the record sound effects actually do require a bit of engineering and design
4745640	4751400	so yes it is somebody's intellectual property yeah i i can't support it's it's a weird thing
4751400	4755400	i i don't think i can support the fact that you know the sound effects people shouldn't be
4755400	4762200	entitled to their thing but but if it's like i i feel like if it's already in the umbrella of
4762200	4768200	the game that you license especially when the game has said we do not care if you broadcast our game
4768760	4773400	then at some point there's got to be a happy medium there where the streamer is absolved of
4773400	4777400	those incidental sound effects that have happened in the background now if a streamer brings in
4777400	4781960	their own sound board and their own sound effects and starts playing that stuff different that's
4781960	4786440	different and absolutely i think that's fine because and this is why honestly like i'm gonna
4786440	4791880	be honest and this isn't what you guys want to hear but i have always been like i'm not gonna
4791880	4797000	play spotify in the background of my streams and i i i i'll watch streams where people do it and
4797000	4801800	i don't care what other people do but i feel like y'all are on borrowed time like they're gonna come
4801800	4807800	in and stop that and sure enough here we are and people are like what i couldn't play spotify about
4807800	4813480	i couldn't play i couldn't play Madonna while i was playing my games no like i felt like that
4813480	4819880	whole stuff was on borrowed time well however i do think that if the game says you can stream us
4819880	4824920	online then this stuff is in the game and it makes that stuff like guitar hero and music based games
4824920	4831400	in this really weird gray area i get it but i i'm not surprised at the music part of it the sound
4831400	4837800	effect stuff gets a little bit tricky and we've seen on youtube where this gets abused so i also
4837800	4842680	because i don't want to see us make it sound like oh i agree in every single instance no no there's
4842680	4848520	cases where somebody is you know in some third party comes in and sound matches that this happened
4848520	4854440	to one of my youtube videos and um i contested it and it took forever but it was one of those things
4854440	4858600	where it's the principle of the thing you know right i feel like there has to be a way to strike
4858600	4864680	back against incorrect claims well i've seen i've seen some where they've actually there's been a
4864680	4869880	guy whispering or something like that was the clip they made it a private clip and it got copyright
4869880	4876440	claimed for something he's like dude that was my own voice like yeah i don't understand that's why
4876440	4879960	when i'm getting ready to start doing mine i'm going to be doing all the music myself
4880760	4886920	and with my own copyright uh notice on on my youtube channel well that's what's funny it's
4886920	4892600	like there was a thing i saw a video talking about like the copyright system and youtube and stuff
4892600	4898840	and apparently the way someone's gotten around is they make a really terrible and you well not
4898840	4906200	necessarily terrible but like a really unique intro or extro song or outro song and you copy
4906200	4912440	you actually submit that to one of those copyright claim um companies that will actually go out there
4912440	4918360	and flag that and so all of your videos are technically copyright claimed by yourself so
4918360	4925000	it's like huh they can't two companies can't claim the same video allegedly or like it the way the
4925000	4930360	money system works it doesn't allow it to flag it or something like that but basically it would
4930360	4937400	it's not demonetizing and actually this works also for allegedly um monetizing unmonetizable
4937400	4942680	things because you're basically a copyright claiming yourself so you're kind of abusing the
4942680	4948840	system i don't feel so bad for the system to be honest considering how broken it is but that is
4948840	4954040	one way around it that you could do um which i thought was interesting uh also the copyright
4954040	4961000	deadlock that uh jim sterling of course uh famously created was pretty funny uh where two
4961000	4966920	companies fight over the copyright claim for one video and technically two different companies
4966920	4972040	can't claim the same content because no one is the owner then you can't say it's my content and then
4972040	4977720	the other company says oh but that's my content as well it doesn't work that way um the the
4977720	4984440	government is going to have to step in and fix this and modernize these rules and um you know i
4984440	4988040	i don't think that necessarily suddenly happens just because we're going to have a change in the
4988040	4992040	administration because you know there's just there's so many other things i think they're
4992040	4997400	they're looking at and so forth however i will say this one thing we talked about at length a
4997400	5003080	couple weeks ago was the whole like alexandria ocasio-cortez got into live streaming and was
5003080	5007960	doing that among us stream that essentially became a huge like political awareness rally
5007960	5013240	that happened on twitch right and there were other people from other political parties watching that
5013240	5018200	like justin amash who wanted to kind of leverage something like that for himself and so on and so
5018200	5025000	on so i think as you start to see more politicians get into this just wait wait for the day that aoc
5025000	5030520	gets a copyright strike on one of her things that's what it's gonna take the whole copyright
5030520	5036360	system needs to be like redone it's just been abused the hell by disney and other companies
5036360	5045320	ria it they have like these i mean they really should be accounting for fair use um like for
5045320	5049880	example one of the examples of another music thing that was taken down was a cover of a song
5049880	5055640	that someone was covering and they they copyright strike it for the original or um someone using
5055640	5060760	like a five second clip to make a remix or something like that or five second clip of a song
5060760	5067000	for some sort of you know uh comedic effect or something and it gets the whole video gets
5067000	5075640	copyrighted for a five second clip that just seems ridiculous um phoenix 7726 says they won't in the
5075640	5081160	same way twitter never banned trump they can see that coming a mile away except well this when
5081160	5086280	they're running bots and automated shit wait until one of them gets caught up in it like the
5086280	5091000	twitter situation's very different because twitter has had to put a flag on the account that basically
5091000	5097480	says you know never never disable or ban this although somebody did remember that yeah for like
5097480	5102200	three hours well it's just temporarily and it's feeling because it's you know an official channel
5102200	5107400	well not really supposed to be an official channel but it's basically it's a government um
5108120	5114280	communication media or something like that now oh so could the army recruitment twitch get struck
5116040	5123240	um well no because see basically like for example they can't ban people from their channels because
5123240	5128760	it's it's technically like a government entity uh no i'm saying if they play the wrong game could
5128760	5135640	the army get a copyright strike i don't know that's i'm telling you do you really want to
5135640	5143960	anger the army i mean that that's how this and i in in a way i kind of do hope it happens and
5143960	5148840	not in the way you think i'm saying that i'm helping it happens because that is what's going
5148840	5153720	to get the government to move on this stuff and you know modernize the the copyright law and all
5153720	5160680	that stuff so anyway all right but we can't fix copyright law tonight on our uh but just be
5160680	5167000	careful on twitch um i i i don't know what else to say about that um the sound effect thing is
5167000	5172680	really scary and i because you know you don't know what games you thought the the creators
5172680	5177160	are totally cool with you playing on stream and then it's like gotcha you know it's that part's
5177160	5184840	a little bit scary i i that doesn't make any sense it doesn't i i get it like it just seems like a
5184840	5190520	stretch like you know like if you're licensing sound effects like that you you know that you're
5191560	5198120	dealing with certain types of clientele it's not like i don't see how it's wind sounds so obviously
5198120	5205000	you know an ai is not gonna it it's not gonna know if that exactly matches that like i i don't know i
5205000	5211080	just feel like it makes mistakes and even like i've seen stuff you know on youtube for example
5211080	5214680	where they're just filming something outside in the park and it gets copyrighted claim for the
5214680	5221080	wind sounds it's like dude like yeah it's too much too much they're there there needs to be
5221080	5226600	and honestly the my idea you know i'm not a politician my idea is and i've been saying this
5226600	5232040	since the very beginning there needs to be a way to have an effective counter claim where the
5232040	5237880	claimant gets striped so that if they are filing too many claims and they do it overdo it too many
5237880	5243800	times they lose the ability to be able to do it or that's what needs to be in there or better yet
5243800	5249880	that they should basically if you're claiming something you can only claim the section of the
5249880	5255480	video that it's in so if i play a five second clip you're not claiming the whole video you're claiming
5255480	5262120	the five second portion of that video and right now even with youtube and sometimes youtube is a
5262120	5266920	little more specific about what it is that someone's claiming a lot of times those claims
5266920	5271640	could be it's supposed to be specific like this is the section where there's the offending material
5272360	5276520	but it's not a lot of times they're missing that and that is i think something that's supposed to
5276520	5281160	be important about the dmca there's it's supposed to those strikes are supposed to include that and
5281160	5285640	they're also supposed to consider fair use but because these corporations know that
5287400	5293160	there's nothing that you're going to be able to do they you know they don't necessarily have to
5293160	5298280	use fair use i mean we've seen people use dmca strikes to take down vias they just don't like
5298280	5304200	yeah you know yeah and use it as an excuse so it's it's a broken system all right well let me move on
5304200	5308360	i'm gonna get to our next story because i don't want the show to go all night but um let's talk
5308360	5313720	about a bunch of money changing hands somewhere else and that is because take two who of course
5313720	5317800	is the publisher behind you know grand theft auto borderlands you might have heard of them i think
5317880	5325160	loki's a little bit of a fan um take two has acquired code masters code masters of course
5325160	5330600	is a big company out of britain uh that makes a lot of like racing games i believe dirt five is
5330600	5336040	kind of their latest and greatest big title um so uh yeah they're gonna uh join the other labels
5336040	5341800	that take two oversees like 2k games which is you know like the the 2k sports and the civilization
5341800	5347000	and all that rock star games uh and private division so code masters is going to be there
5347000	5352120	uh no words yet as to is there going to be any restructuring or any moving around and things
5352120	5359560	like that um but uh in a comment uh to business wire the boss at take two straus zelnick said
5359560	5364040	that the racing output the code master does is going to fit well with the publishing giant's
5364040	5369480	existing sports fair um and then code masters will benefit from the distribution and marketing at
5369480	5374920	take two so it does kind of sound like it could be a mutually beneficial situation and i don't
5374920	5379320	really see that like these games are going to go anywhere they're going to suddenly put code masters
5379320	5387000	on like a different type of game but i mean we'll see what happens well you know it is take two
5387000	5393240	let's not let's not confuse things i like rockstar games i don't necessarily like take two okay two
5393240	5399560	is just about as bad as ea and activision they are going to monetize the crap out of this stuff
5400120	5405160	um well good for code masters at least you know that's a little bit more exposure i guess for
5405160	5414680	their games but it's just going to be a mess i mean just look at wwe and you know mba 2k
5415320	5419400	to get an idea of what take two likes to do with their franchises i mean so it's
5419400	5427720	uh best of luck to them all right good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor all right
5428520	5431080	moving on on a different note dar sakura
5433960	5441800	well you know i like to talk about um video games being used for for good um and cambridge uh the
5441800	5450920	cambridge researchers um actually put together a um a game that's supposed to help people online
5450920	5459160	learn how to debunk uh fake news i hate using the term fake news but meant to debunk disinformation
5459160	5466760	um how to recognize uh you know legitimate information versus misinformation um game is
5466760	5478040	called harmony square and it's just a simple web game um you basically are uh shown a a news story
5478680	5485960	um it it has like four different decision-based chapters to help you master these different
5485960	5495160	techniques um on how to spread fake news and troll and then you will can you will master those
5495160	5502680	techniques and learn then what it is that's prompting people to believe these things and
5502680	5509880	for you to evaluate your own feelings and your own triggers to make yourself think more critically
5509880	5520200	and it actually works um they tested it with 700 participants and then um you know they had them
5520200	5527640	rate headlines and social media posts prior to this um and then they had half of them play
5527640	5534200	harmony square and they have a half to play tetris and after it was huh no i'm just laughing
5534200	5540920	giggling at the the control group in that case and so they they had them do it again with different
5540920	5547000	headlines and then with their conclusion um that i'm going to quote the perceived reliability of
5547000	5554520	misinformation of the participants who played harmony square reduced to 16 um and their
5554520	5562440	willingness to share those things reduced by 11 and and even so i mean that's you know saying
5562440	5569320	that if that with that population split down the middle um 63 of that half that played it would
5569320	5575080	find misinformation significantly less reliable this is actually from the report um compared to
5575080	5581240	237 of the left half to navigate online information without the inoculation of harmony square
5581960	5590360	and you can um go to harmony square dot game and try it for yourself interesting and i'm
5590360	5594360	sorry i might have missed it at the beginning is this is this a game for kids or adults or like
5594360	5600040	all ages everybody okay it's just i i you know when i hear something like this i'm kind of like
5600040	5604680	this is the type of stuff i hope they're teaching kids in like high school or junior high you know
5604760	5610840	this is this is stuff like unfortunately that's where our society has evolved and um i know we
5610840	5615000	were playing things like oregon trail and number munchers and math blasters and stuff when we were
5615000	5619880	younger and i think there's still room for games like that um but like this is the type of thing
5619880	5624840	i hope they're using in school because unfortunately in this day and age uh that is not a skill that
5624840	5630040	is learned by everybody is how to not fall for bullshit uh and there's a lot of bullshit on
5630040	5640360	facebook and insert social media platform here so some yeah um no one special 77 in chat makes
5640360	5645320	a little joke saying cambridge needs to make 13 games to teach folks how to point out clickbait
5645320	5650920	articles game number seven will surprise you that's that's pretty good no one special in
5650920	5654520	in your uh history of joke making here on this program that's that's one of the better ones
5654520	5662440	so kudos to you all right but i i i i do love and dark soccer i'm glad you brought that story up
5662440	5669240	because i do love that idea of gamification or gamifying and gamification of a topic uh we need
5669240	5674280	to be educating more about and talking about for sure so whether whether whatever term you want to
5674280	5680840	use for it you know bullshit on social media is something we need to as a society get stronger in
5680840	5691080	dealing with so the the other thing too is that i i think of it like this that maybe it's a little
5691080	5699960	bit sad that we have to use a game to teach because people won't by themselves educate
5699960	5705480	themselves does that make sense people don't want to be educated they want to be entertained right
5706280	5714520	and that is honestly a social disease um since i have i think no well i'll just say since i've
5714520	5720440	done a lot with educating over the years i can see how games can sometimes work as an application
5720440	5724600	method because you know some people are going to learn by listening to the lecture some people are
5724600	5728760	going to learn by visually but with pretty charts and graphs or reading in a book something with
5728760	5734840	their eyes but a lot of people learn by doing and i kind of feel like games i mean yes they're games
5734840	5739800	but they're a way to learn by doing um especially when it comes to things that are more like soft
5739800	5746120	skills as opposed to put widget a on top of widget b you know in that type of application
5746120	5753160	like a game of this sort can be an application of it when you present a game with the purpose
5753160	5761400	of educating covertly people aren't going into it expecting to learn something but when you are in
5761400	5767960	you know a classroom environment and you're doing supplemental you know exercises or games people
5767960	5773640	are there knowing that they're there to learn and that this is i'll be honest i hate in class games
5773640	5780200	i just want you to give me the information let me learn it let me go um you know it is so funny
5780200	5784520	because all of my trainers where i work know this about me now and they're just like did you already
5784520	5791880	finish the modules like i finished all the days modules can i can i finish um but uh but back to
5791880	5797720	that you know it's some people do need it but when they know that they're being educated it's
5797720	5804280	a different thing if it is a game presented hey play this it's fun and then they learn something
5804280	5811400	from it that it's not what they think the primary purpose of it is then and you know if you if you
5811400	5818440	like hey this thing is is a problem and we need to learn how not to do it if you give that to them
5818440	5824840	they're gonna be like i guess i don't care versus hey here's this game to play oh wow i learned
5824840	5829640	something from this game i didn't expect it to happen you know what i mean yeah that's a
5829640	5835560	completely different thing like yeah i i am by the way i'm alert by doing myself i just hate those
5835560	5840440	exercises because i know that that's all it is i would rather you just give me the information and
5840440	5845320	let me figure it out i get the perspective of the i might pleasantly learn something while playing
5845320	5849160	a game like take a game like civilization you might actually learn something about history and
5849160	5855240	world leaders playing that game but that's not not why you signed up to play does that make sense so
5855240	5859720	yeah all right all right well let's move on and let's um go to loki with our next story
5862200	5867560	yeah so this is pretty cool like i know uh they did the similar things with different valve games
5867560	5875640	i can remember like portal and portal 2 had these in-game commentaries but now half-life alex also
5875640	5883960	shares that as they've now received um three hours of commentary in that game so you can actually
5883960	5889080	check it out within the game itself and it kind of talks about the behind the scenes and a
5889080	5896440	development process of the game itself including 147 points of interest to find and uh talking
5896440	5904200	about the hands-on nature of uh their narration and it's also available in several different
5904200	5910600	uh languages if you want subtitles so that's pretty awesome as well um pretty cool i i
5911240	5916760	still haven't finished this game so i really do need to go back and play more half-life alex
5916760	5920520	because it's pretty awesome but i do like the commentaries that were in there as well they're
5920520	5924280	always very interesting okay i was gonna ask because i have to admit i don't know if i've
5924280	5928600	played a video game with the commentary on and i was kind of curious and opening it that this
5928600	5932680	question of the chat as well how many of you have played through video games with the commentary on
5932680	5938840	so you you have done this loki yeah i played through a little bit of portal i think and i think
5938840	5945480	that they had portal 2 had the same thing but you can actually go through that and uh check it out
5945480	5949320	and they have these like little icons on the screen you go up to and it talks about like
5949320	5954040	especially with the original portal like different puzzle designs and stuff like that so it's pretty
5954040	5959800	cool i've watched a couple of movies with commentary tracks but very few and i've always
5959800	5965560	found that they're almost always better if there's more than one person when there's just one person
5965560	5969560	it's not always the most exciting thing in the world it depends on who it is and i feel like
5969560	5976840	some people don't want to be there but others do so it really um kind of changes that uh no one
5976840	5981960	special 77 says when i still had a ps3 and the orange box for that i tried the commentary for
5981960	5986520	that like i've probably like tried it but i don't think i've ever like actually said oh
5986520	5994360	there's a commentary track out for this game i want to try it so it's interesting um sg100 matt
5994360	5998360	says i haven't experienced this enough i get the sense i would do that on a second playthrough
5998360	6002440	you know what if something like mass effect had a commentary track i'd probably play through with
6002440	6006920	it but there's so much that that game is so long i'm not sure if a commentary track would really
6006920	6012120	work but it'd be interesting so all right it'd be cool if like games like that let you create
6012120	6017560	a custom commentary track like we could create one in game and like store different like clips
6017560	6022120	here like hey you probably don't want to go around the corners jump scare over there just
6022120	6025560	just beware jump scare right there well that's what you do in demon souls you leave the little
6025560	6032680	pieces of paper at least i think you still do that anyway all right uh moving on uh i'm sure
6032680	6037640	a lot of you saw this floating around social media this week and it's it's like the ridiculous like
6037640	6043480	what the hell are you doing with these consoles and um so in this case did everybody see that
6043480	6049320	video of the xbox series x where smoke was coming out of the top of the vent and it was that
6049320	6057480	youtube that was like omg my xbox series x on launch day caught fire well you can very clearly
6057480	6063240	see in the corner there's smoke going into the xbox that then comes out of the holes on the top
6063240	6071800	because yes somebody actually was blowing vape smoke into the vent at the bottom which of course
6071800	6078600	smoke rises fun fact science and it came well at the top it's also because they developed that
6078600	6083720	console to have nice airflow so it just sucks it up and spits it right out which is why the
6083720	6087880	playstation 5 is also shaped the way it is is that it's to help with the airflow so you know
6087880	6092200	both these consoles with their you know beefy parts that are doing all the fancy ray tracing
6092200	6097640	and everything have to have really good airflow in it so honestly the vape smoke technique is
6097640	6102840	showing wow the airflow is really good on these systems um yeah and i like i like the comment
6102840	6107640	though that they had on like i can't believe i have to tell you this but yeah don't blow vape
6107640	6114200	smoke into your xbox series x xbox actually put out a tweet uh a few days ago on november the 11th
6114200	6118920	so i was actually the day before uh the day after the launch where they said we can't believe we
6118920	6124200	have to say this but please do not blow vape smoke into your xbox series x
6126840	6132120	but that just goes that also goes all into like the fake news type of thing we were just bringing
6132120	6138040	up is that this person only did it to get clicks on omg and that that can have a negative impact
6138040	6141960	on xbox because somebody's going to believe it like you got to see this video where a dude's
6141960	6149480	micro thing caught fire people like chasing clout yeah i know yeah and as and as mentioned in chat
6149480	6156520	by bobby yeah and also vape smoke can hurt your xbox like let's you know let's let's not forget
6156520	6160680	that part is that you know there's what makes the vape smoke there's a little bit of water in there
6160680	6165640	and stuff right you should not be putting those on computer parts and and i mean we should probably
6165640	6172280	also ignore obviously i didn't watch any videos like this but i'm it they're always out there
6172280	6177000	there's always the people that are smashing these new systems when they came out because
6177000	6181400	you know four clicks because haha you can't get one i got one and now i'm gonna break it you know
6181400	6187960	it's like i don't know whatever people are dumb whatever happened to the video where here's my
6187960	6195160	brand new xbox series x but here's my knife uh-huh it's a cake like i thought that's where
6195160	6201960	we were at in 2020 where's my xbox series x is actually a cake like where's that or playstation
6201960	6207000	five i'll take that would have been a twist like oh hey look my xbox series x is on fire it's
6207000	6217560	because it's a cake uh no unfortunately we're not there yet i don't know why i'm obsessed with those
6217560	6223640	cake videos that are like surprise it's a case that i know it's a cake going in but i'm always
6223640	6232840	kind of like wow these are like really well done cakes you know all right let's go let's go back
6232840	6239720	to a simpler time when in fact it was not a cake it was it was just a game the classic game of the
6239720	6248600	week it wasn't a cake it was a lie uh dark soccer is gonna step into the gaming vault and find a
6248600	6254360	game that she thinks hey uh you should be checking out this game this week uh and this is oh man
6254360	6258600	you've got a classic tonight it's one of those ones where it's like how has this never been
6258600	6263720	picked before yet again here we are what i texted you yeah it is it is and that's why i'm saying it
6263720	6269240	again what's funny as i was describing this to dan is the game where you run around in pajamas and
6269320	6275880	shoot people's livers and spleens because that's kind of what they look like that is so the classic
6275880	6286200	game of the week is uh alien syndrome so uh it is a running gun it was developed by sega and it came
6286200	6294840	out in the arcades in 1987 um so basically you uh have two soldiers that you play as one named ricky
6294840	6301560	and one mary and they go through this levels that will have a way scrolling and you have to rescue
6301560	6310120	your comrades who are being held by aliens who uh well they look like spleens and livers to me green
6310120	6318520	and and pink very pink looking organ meat um anyway um so uh after you rescue a certain number
6318520	6324920	of hostages uh an exit will open and you can go through to fight you know the boss for the level
6324920	6330280	the the end of level guardian as this likes to say and then when you've defeated it then you're able
6330280	6337880	to go on to the next stage um and it does allow two players simultaneous um and you can do pickups
6337880	6345400	to assist the character get different weapons get maps of the level um and you know it's it's a very
6345400	6354680	very simple game that people can be kind of all up in arms about versions of it um so um the game
6354680	6364520	uh had different ports um in 1988 its first series of ports were on the sega master system the msx
6364520	6373080	the amiga atari st the amstrad cpc commodore 64 and the uh famicon or nes that was published by
6373080	6378920	tangen because nintendo would grant the license um there were later ports there was the zx spectrum
6378920	6388360	in 1989 game gear in 1992 and oh gosh i wish i owned one of these a sharp x68000 in 1992 which
6388360	6394280	was the only arcade perfect port because i mean it was fucking sharp x6800 what you by sixty
6394280	6403000	eight thousand what would you expect um so and honestly it was just like it was sort of that
6403000	6410280	era of you know of games right where it kind of had just like that almost minimalist kind of
6410280	6417480	music to it and it was kind of simple but a little bit more complex than the other things you know it
6417480	6428760	was it was just a really cool game um it was uh listed as uh one of as the third most successful
6428760	6437880	arcade unit um by a game machine in japan it was listed that um in 1987 in their article on it
6437880	6445400	um the original version was also uh reviewed by computer and video games uh magazine in 87
6445400	6450520	it was called one of the most gripping games they've been playing for months um and it was
6450520	6458760	very reminiscent of of alien or uh you know or aliens i should say i mean i i honestly see more
6458760	6467080	in common with alien than aliens but um you know and it also uh the master system version was
6467080	6476520	actually given really really high ratings as well um so the game did get um uh an upgrade um for the
6476520	6485480	ps2 uh sega ages 2500 uh series um and uh it was brought over in the us in the sega classics
6485480	6490760	collection um however it was ruined for the european version to get a lower age certificate
6490760	6499160	they upgraded controls they uh gave it polygon graphics um analog controls um and they did
6499160	6504600	include the original game as an unlockable in sonic's ultimate genesis collection um the thing
6504600	6510920	is is that the sadly the sega ages version is not very good it really is not very good
6511560	6520040	um there was a sequel also called alien syndrome that was released on wii and psp in 2007 and so
6520040	6526840	there you go alien syndrome you know shoot shoot the alien headed thing shoot the livers and you
6526840	6532760	know spleens that try to come at you it's kind of gauntlet-y you know with with aliens and spleens
6535000	6538360	so there you go all right sorry i stepped away for a second but i'm back
6540120	6546600	uh yes alien syndrome uh a game that uh i played this on the nes i think i remember the tengan
6546600	6554360	cart for this uh and playing that so uh and it was hard i remember but maybe i'm better at games now
6554360	6563960	i don't know i think that we may be now this is actually something i'm gonna go a little bit into
6563960	6573960	it um i think that um it may not necessarily be a better or worse our perception's different
6574680	6581480	and we're gonna try to do one thing one way when we're a kid but when you go back and play it when
6581480	6586280	you're older you sometimes try to follow that old instinct but you think something else is gonna
6586280	6592120	make sense and i think that's just a difference in a gaming as a mature gamer that's very true
6592120	6596440	you know something like like mega man is very much a game about patterns right like you've
6596440	6602760	often talked about your um ability to play a certain section of mega man to all of us ability
6603560	6607400	yeah like blindfolded because it's really it's really just a game about memorizing patterns
6607400	6611720	if you think about it but being able to execute those patterns perfectly um and i think some of
6611720	6615160	that is probably true with what i'm watching here on aliens it's been a long time since i
6615160	6619800	played this game but um i and what i'm watching in the footage here is i'm like it's really just it
6619800	6623240	seems like it's just patterns like this person knows exactly where they're running exactly what
6623240	6629240	they're shooting um and there's like a pattern thing to it before i didn't say if it was a task
6629240	6639480	play yeah uh um maybe but but i mean this is still the thing too is that with the older games like
6639480	6644680	this they're a lot of them more patterns are you know there's not really as much i'd say uh
6645560	6651640	programming real estate to have a more complicated ai in games like this good point
6652440	6657000	yeah so and it doesn't look like and as far as i'm aware i don't think this particular
6657000	6659960	game has a whole lot of rng to deal with short of boss battles
6662040	6668840	so all right well a real classic there uh your classic game of the week alien syndrome
6668840	6672920	uh originally in the arcade and then pretty much everywhere else at the time
6673880	6678840	and that large list the dark sakura read us earlier all right well let's get into some
6678840	6684600	rapid fire news and travel around the world and uh we'll look at world release dates right after
6684600	6690600	but first some rapid fire news uh loki we'll start with you uh yes so there's lots of fun
6690600	6697880	news regarding sam and max's week including a brand new uh remaster that's going to be coming to
6697880	6705640	pc and switch uh this december so sam and max save the world remastered uh looks pretty awesome
6705640	6712520	and um yeah i'd like some more sam max and with that i'm probably gonna get some more sam and max
6712520	6721160	because they're gonna be uh coming to vr as well with sam and max uh this time it's virtual and
6721160	6727560	it's a brand new vr game that's coming out as well in early 2021 so i am definitely gonna be

6751080	6759000	to be coming out may 21st 2021 and they are charging uh sixty dollars instead of seventy

6770520	6775720	seventy dollars watches and say sony is doing the same thing as well um charging seventy dollars for
6775720	6783240	their games hopefully that doesn't stick but at least we know that it's gonna be um you know
6783240	6788280	not that it's gonna be sixty dollars instead it looks like a great game uh it's still only on

7219160	7224840	for me please i specifically wanted you to talk about that tonight because i wanted that reaction
7224840	7230920	of i want it well and the other thing is that people go oh why is it digital because
7231560	7235560	digital music does not sell as well in japan as physical media
7237800	7247000	so okay also um for people who are still into pokemon sapphire a fish beat pokemon sapphire
7247000	7257960	after 3195 hours so um basically they have fish swimming around um and they use motion tracking
7257960	7267240	on them so uh these fish uh beat beat pokemon why are we reporting this because it's that
7267240	7276200	awkward moment when a fish has more gamer credibility than i do well basically i think
7276200	7280200	it's also to demonstrate you know i like actually this particular article brings it up because it
7280200	7286280	was the first thing i was thinking of was the uh the infinite monkey theorem that states if you
7286280	7290200	have a monkey hitting keys on a typewriter for an infinite amount of time it'll eventually type out
7290200	7296280	a shakespeare play um that was all that that also goes back to the twitch place pokemon phenomenon
7296280	7301560	from a few years ago was in that exact same thing was cited the whole and i've heard it also as the
7301560	7306600	broken clock is right twice a day type of thing it's that same type of theory but on a much larger
7306600	7313640	scale so interesting all right uh let's move on and travel around the world and check out some
7313640	7318680	release dates of some games that your fish might beat very soon or in 3000 days or whatever it took
7318680	7325400	uh loki let's start in the us all right so in the us we've got bubble bobble for friends the

7551400	7558760	itself is coming to other regions in asia because remember there was the weak delay um and uh jamie
7558760	7564040	will get to it because it affects europe as well uh but it also impacted asia um otherwise
7564040	7568120	playstation 5 has nothing this week i imagine they've uh you know kind of put out all the stuff
7568120	7573640	the week the system came out uh for a little while uh looking at the playstation 4 though
7573640	7577800	just because they're still going to release things on that for a little while yep katamari

7654600	7660200	all right let's move on we have some more stories for you guys i think it's very important that we
7660200	7669800	elaborate on that game one more time um oh boy so taking a look at it so it's literally like flying
7669800	7677640	underwear that you're fighting as it is a 3d like fighting like action game where you play as
7677640	7685560	sentient underwear apparently it looks ridiculous uh phoenix 77 26 wants to know is chris hanson an
7685560	7691000	unlockable character well no it's it's not really people there's no people in the game it's just
7691000	7697240	flying underwear all right uh well let's move on loki why don't you uh start us off with some more
7697240	7705320	actual news all right let's talk about it um so apparently there japan uh sony is gonna stop
7705320	7711720	servicing the original playstation 4 which seems quite surprising considering that um
7712680	7718440	i mean we just got the playstation 5 apparently they're what they're talking about is the original
7719320	7727480	version of the playstation 4 that launched back in 2014 they are gonna stop servicing but the slim
7727480	7734680	and pro series they're gonna still do repairs and whatnot on those um it's just the original model
7735080	7744200	which still though it seems like it's a pretty soon to stop um supporting that but you can do
7744200	7747800	whatever they want at least they know what a playstation 4 is and having completely forgot
7747800	7752680	about it thank you vita the headlines on this i think were a little deceptive too because it
7752680	7758200	was saying like playstation 4 is no longer services well it's some it's the launch so but
7758200	7763640	it definitely uh it does seem pretty aggressive to be on its way out the door you know what i mean
7763640	7770520	like the five just came out you know exactly i i think it's a bit soon and considering that you
7770520	7776280	know people are probably getting rid of their playstation fours for playstation fives i mean
7776280	7780440	they don't want to deal with the second hand maybe maybe i don't know but
7782440	7788280	i haven't i haven't decided if i want to keep my xbox one or maybe get rid of it um i just don't
7788360	7793400	know who won it this one you you want do you not have an xbox one dark sakura
7794120	7801400	oh i thought you guys had one no we got ps4 let's talk if i mean i at least want to borrow it yeah
7801400	7807400	if you know what honestly yes i would be fine with you in this way you don't have to give me money
7807400	7813480	because i would be fine with it having a long-term home um because when we move eventually i'll
7813480	7817400	probably set it up as a secondary media player but i don't really have the space right now
7817400	7822440	so i'll be honest our ps3 and ps4 are both connected we use the ps4 for youtube and we
7822440	7828920	use the ps3 for uh the few times we actually watch physical disc um not just oh bobby says i know
7828920	7832840	some parents who want an xbox one because i can play minecraft well jamie if you if you really
7832840	7838120	want let's let's talk because i i can uh do that i'm a cat parent that wants to play minecraft
7838120	7842040	well to be fair everything plays minecraft nowadays so it's fine that's true too um
7842040	7846040	anyways just speaking of which jamie um i guess uh you're gonna go ahead and bow out for the night
7846200	7849880	just to take care of yourself and because you've been a little under the weather so uh
7849880	7853080	and we could hear we could hear it you're starting to go during the release dates so um
7853720	7857640	uh thank you of course for sticking it out and being here tonight glad glad you got to have a
7857640	7862520	full show tonight sort of sorta i mean without the i'm referring to the power drops last week
7862520	7870120	or god internet drops last week the goal is with uh another week of resting my voice that i will be
7870760	7878440	100 so fingers crossed but i i would also still like to take the opportunity to tell people
7878440	7884760	pay the fuck attention to what cdc is telling you wear your mask social distance don't fucking go
7884760	7890040	to anybody's house for thanksgiving just saying yeah unless you've all been tested
7892120	7896760	we're doing we're doing the two-week stay at home thing so we can see my dad but that is it we are
7896760	7902360	only seeing my dad so but like i can't let him be alone i can't so yeah i understand i'm taking
7902360	7909000	i'm actually taking a test on uh monday to to test myself again they sent me three boxes of tests
7909000	7915160	from work i'm like why you already tested me yeah all right take care of yourself jamie we'll talk
7915160	7921560	to you in a week thanks bye all right moving on let's get to our next story where we talk about
7921960	7926680	youtube premium and i gotta fix the cameras here real quick though sorry
7926680	7933160	awkward transition all right there we go all right um let's talk about a free google stadia
7933160	7938920	but the catch is you have to be a youtube premium member so you get the 99 bundle that features a
7938920	7944840	chromecast ultra and a gamepad if you are a youtube premium member this is for members in
7944840	7949960	the us and the uk you get the stadia premiere edition a 99 bundle with the chromecast ultra
7949960	7955000	and stadia controller and uh yeah you get that and then you get a free month of stadia pro with
7955000	7960280	that but you have to remember to cancel that or they're gonna get you on that um so i'm sure this
7960280	7965640	is where people want to insert the joke that they can't even give it away well you know what like i
7966840	7972920	well for one stadia is supposed to be free anyway so like you know what are you getting you're
7972920	7977160	getting the chromecast ultra that's kind of like the first level of doing this but the weird thing
7977160	7985720	is um alan has been like a youtube subscriber for a long time um and he couldn't get one it said he
7985720	7990680	wasn't eligible for it i didn't get that but google has also given away quite a few things
7990680	7995160	both alan and i have google homes well we have obviously we have two in the house one in the
7995160	8000440	bedroom in the living room because of our spotify subscriptions and they gave away a free google
8000440	8004760	with that or his might have even come from a cell phone i don't remember but google has definitely
8004760	8008760	given their stuff away before i don't know what do you what do you think about them giving away
8008760	8016840	stadia chromecast and all that for free loki i mean i guess they figured if you're buying
8016840	8023000	their youtube premium service that you're probably ripe to you know be interested in
8023000	8031720	such a terrible service as stadia um no i i don't know it's it sounds like a last ditch effort to
8031720	8038840	try to get people either hooked on youtube premium or stadia i i just think they're gonna have to
8038840	8045160	change their model at some point to make it more like games pass but i don't know we'll see um
8046600	8051080	it sucks that he's not able to redeem that considering he would be a subscriber to
8051080	8055960	you know um yeah i don't know what your premium the weird hold up is i have to look into what
8055960	8060840	kind of error message he's getting or whatever but anyway um and some comments here uh did you
8060840	8065720	rama s in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says damn google is desperate to get rid of them
8065720	8072280	um maybe but remember here's the thing stadia is supposed to be free anyway but the weird the
8072280	8078840	missing part here is that how how far are we into the launch of stadia and we still don't have that
8078840	8084600	version that you just sign on to the web and play unless you are a pro subscriber right or am i
8084600	8090440	mixing that up can you just go on with any old gmail account and do it now on the web i don't
8090440	8094440	know you could do it with pro but i don't think you could do it with just like a free one
8094440	8101000	um so it's it's just the whole thing's a little weird um i just feel like google just
8101000	8108120	flood this launch so bad i don't know um pixel pocket says i'm very sad about google play music
8108120	8112120	i downloaded all my stuff and put it on my plex server instead i forgot they just recently shut
8112120	8118040	that down that's right um i think i had a bunch of olr episodes on there a bunch of old ones
8118040	8124520	so um yeah uh st100 matt says they want to get folks to get it so they can release that
8124520	8129640	gotta have stadia game which they don't have yet so it'll be interesting to see the effect this
8129640	8135320	has i know people that are cashing in on it because hey free chrome cast right it's not
8135320	8140520	just a stadia it's a chrome cast so i know people that are cashing in on it is it some type of maybe
8140520	8144840	trojan horse trick i don't know especially when they talk about signing you up for a free month
8144840	8150040	the stadia pro i i don't know but it'll be interesting to see what kind of impact this
8150040	8156360	might have on stadia if any so i would i still think it's just their core service isn't worth
8156360	8163080	paying for i mean it just doesn't paying for the service and then i have to also buy the games on
8163080	8167960	the service doesn't make any sense it's just especially when there's other companies offering
8168680	8175560	stuff it it's just cheaper and like i i don't get what the the value proposition is that they're
8176200	8183240	saying especially since there's not new really i mean aside from there's nothing really exclusive
8183240	8189560	to that platform either like i just don't get what they are hoping to do with this like i i don't
8189560	8194520	know oh now this is a service again die dgrms says alan couldn't get it because the promotion
8194920	8200280	for it ran out so people in chat are asking how do i get in on this it sounds like you might it's
8200920	8208600	all have been claimed the end so interesting brilliant i wonder if this was all just a trick
8208600	8213000	to get out get us all to talk about it i don't know but it would be great if they could put out
8213000	8217080	like that killer game that would i know i'm totally getting stadia now that i've talked
8217080	8225720	about it yeah all right uh moving on to another story and uh this has to do with uh the the not
8225720	8231240	twitch con is going on right now the glitch con or whatever um and this is some i i didn't really
8231240	8238200	catch a lot of big twitch news out of that i i like a big new feature coming or anything like
8238200	8242200	that maybe you guys did and can correct me in chat and that feature is that they're gonna start
8242280	8248440	flagging your games for wins besides all of that besides all of that letting that go for a minute
8248440	8253960	um well one of the big stories that came out of it was that um the co why can't i read this article
8253960	8259880	here okay the co of able gamers who's uh pretty popular on social media uh steven spon i hope i
8259880	8264680	said his last name right sorry um but he's the co of able gamers and this charity has been around
8264680	8268680	a while it's actually um the charity that my amazon smile is set to for what it's worth
8269000	8274280	and they're they do a lot of great things for gamers with disabilities um in in video games
8274280	8282920	and one of the cool things that happened uh out of glitch con was that uh the co steven had wanted
8282920	8288760	to for his birthday because he just hit his 40th birthday i believe wanted to raise one million
8288760	8295480	dollars for the able gamers charity and um twitch just said here you go here's a million bucks for
8295480	8301080	able gamers so there's your goal and then some so that's pretty awesome uh and that all happened
8301080	8306840	during a stream with dr lupo and the ceo of twitch uh emmett shear uh and that twitch is
8306840	8313080	going to donate one million dollars to able gamers that is pretty awesome uh and it's interesting
8313080	8318760	because uh steven has said on twitter i've talked to the rock i've talked to ryan reynolds i'm
8318760	8323080	paraphrasing this is not exact words i've talked to the rock i've talked to ryan reynolds but
8323080	8326360	that is the one that caught me caught me off guard so that is cool
8327560	8334120	great charity good news we like gaming good news all right i'm trying to look in chat to see if
8334120	8339720	anybody had said uh uh bobby blackwolf says that's nice of them considering twitch just laid off
8339720	8344920	their accessibility manager i guess it's easier to give money to charity than actually do any
8345000	8346120	accessibility work
8350840	8357800	but true which did you catch my subtle segue to our next story logi yes i it was so subtle
8359240	8365560	so uh we got to hear from tommy talarico this week and you may be wondering what the hell does
8365560	8372840	that have to do with roblox well it's because apparently uh roblox corporation um lifted a
8372840	8379720	little bit of his sound effects uh or sound design from an old game called messiah back in
8379720	8386920	2000 and thought no one would notice but apparently someone did and so there was uh some stuff behind
8386920	8392920	the scenes and they finally settled to where uh the game the game is no longer not gonna have that
8392920	8401240	oof uh sound effect for free um so what's happening basically is tommy talarico is going to
8401240	8408600	allow them to have that sound effect back in the game if you are a creator of games on roblox you
8408600	8415240	can actually purchase the sound effect to use in your games for 100 um robux i think it's like
8415240	8421640	a dollar and then on top of that he's also going to be creating some new sound effects that you
8421640	8427160	could also use in your games as well ranging anywhere from like 10 bucks to 250 dollars
8427160	8431720	depending on the number of sounds that are included with it so it's available to developers
8431720	8437240	on there also he is uh working with the roblox corporation to create an official oof t-shirt
8437240	8441560	they're gonna sell them sure he's gonna get proceeds from uh but basically yeah the whole
8441560	8447880	thing's been settled without uh seems like a lawsuit um but yeah that was kind of interesting
8447880	8452360	that they've been well i wouldn't say it's interesting because if you've played roblox or
8452360	8458920	of browse through roblox you'll know that because a lot of the developer a lot of these games are
8458920	8465880	created by kids kids have no concept of copyright law or i mean this is literally just a bomb
8465880	8472360	waiting to go off as far as ip theft goes it's just ridiculous and so it's not surprising that
8472360	8478520	at the heart of the game more ip theft my my understanding of how that all happened was that
8478520	8486120	you know when they made roblox they kind of got like a uh one of those like a 1000 sound effects
8486120	8491720	licenseable for your thing or whatever and i'm i'm i don't know those exact details but it's one
8491720	8498040	of those like you know license a bunch of sound effects and the oof was included in there and oof
8498040	8502760	it shouldn't have been because it wasn't licensed from tommy or anything like that it was essentially
8502760	8509000	stolen so roblox thought that they had licensed it appropriately but it sounds like this middle
8509000	8514200	person uh is the one that's really to blame whoever had ripped it off for their collection
8514200	8521800	so interesting yeah so at least there is no harm no foul but they've worked on you know uh some
8521800	8528120	fair resolution for it uh no one specials on fire tonight uh pixel pakka says official oof t-shirt
8528120	8535800	lol to which no one special 77 chat replies it's an official t-shirt nice
8539480	8545960	yeah so you've been listening to orange lounge radio sorry i had to i had to do the roll credits
8545960	8552920	on the bad joke all right go ahead are we gonna see uh are we gonna see any uh roblox heading to
8553000	8559640	the amico or anything like that now that tommy's uh mixed that would be a gag that would be a gag
8559640	8565960	but i believe that the um the rule on amico is that everything has to be for amico and exclusive
8565960	8571240	to it i mean they could maybe dance around and have some type of uh official uh roblox
8572760	8579720	side game or version but um who knows anything's possible i guess yeah all right
8580680	8584200	one more story for you guys before we get to the round table let's talk about
8584200	8591640	plague inc this game has uh been talked about especially this year i can't imagine why but um
8592280	8599080	there's a new mode that they launched uh just in time where you try to stop a pandemic do you
8599080	8606680	think it's easy boys and girls well now you can try uh through plague inc so uh this new mode
8606760	8611880	called the cure mode you have to find a balance between contact tracing that scene research
8613000	8618360	helping to save the economy locking down as appropriate and so forth uh to try to bring
8618360	8624600	the end of a pandemic and if you figure it out call the white house um and let them know because
8624600	8630200	uh they might need some help but yeah so interesting is that it's the reverse of what
8630280	8637240	plague inc kind of was before is that you actually wanted to spread a virus to wipe out humanity
8637240	8643720	so this is the the more hopeful version of that to go for 2020 so i think that's kind of interesting
8643720	8648200	it's cute that the game's been turned on its head like that so have you ever played this game loki
8648200	8652760	i have to admit i haven't no i have i've heard a lot about it uh certainly because of what's
8652760	8658360	been going on this year so i imagine there'll be some streams and things like that so all right
8658360	8666120	um let's get to the listener roundtable we're going to invite your questions and comments uh
8666120	8671960	to our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network also um this is the part of the show
8671960	8678600	where we get into the mailbag now this week we didn't have any emails however because last week's
8678600	8683400	show got cut off early thanks to the internet we actually had some emails from last week we never
8683400	8688760	got to so i do want to read these two emails but i am going to warn you guys um it may be a little
8688760	8694680	dated because we're now two weeks from when they were sent um but let's get to our first email
8694680	8699960	tonight which is from i believe this is no one special although it's unsigned uh all right here
8699960	8704920	we go hi all i hope all is well with you this week since it's been a while since my last email
8704920	8709160	i thought i'd send one this week uh plus unless i think of something at the last second sending
8709160	8713400	this email negates the need for me to send one of my long-winded listener roundtable subjects
8713400	8719080	so while this isn't wholly email worthy i do have some good news to report so for brevity's sake i'll
8719080	8724680	tldr this despite it being incredibly late and i have giving up any hope of getting it i will
8724680	8730120	finally get that 1200 stimulus check in about a week i got a call from my ssdpe the other day
8730120	8734360	stating that she just received it on my behalf since stimulus checks went out to wherever people
8734360	8738200	who are on social security have their federal monthly checks sent and when her agency mails
8738200	8742360	out checks this week she'll forward the money to me now i'm imagining that there's a chance that
8742360	8746520	at least one of you are asking yourselves okay good for you what does this relate to gaming
8746520	8751880	after all olr is a show about gaming well to be fair it's a show about gaming and tangents
8753560	8758360	good point i'm getting to that as i've mentioned from time to time in the past one thing i've
8758360	8762280	always wanted was an honest to goodness arcade cabinet something like a classic game from the
8762280	8767560	80s or 90s be it any version of street fighter 2 one of the 2d mortal combat games cruisin usa
8767560	8773160	a neo geo mvs etc even with 1200 i still can't afford one of those unfortunately
8774040	8779480	they are closer to 2500 or 3000 at the least so that being said i'm going to bite the proverbial
8779480	8786280	bullet and buy the arcade one up version of the neo geo mvs from amazon linked to the amazon page
8786280	8792920	now before i go any further i don't recall arcade one up doing a neo geo no it's snk actually thank
8792920	8799480	you okay that's what i thought so snks actually themselves however it is it is probably happening
8799480	8806120	due to the success of arcade one up and i'm sure we have arcade one up to thank for this coming out
8806120	8811240	and it's very much in a similar vein to the arcade one up machines but i do just want to make that
8811240	8817880	clarity point is that arcade one up themselves is not the one doing it but you wouldn't necessarily
8817880	8824600	know by looking okay so um that all being said let me finish email maybe if i can swing it i'll
8824600	8829160	also order a few things from my pc on top of the neo geo mvs like new ram new controller and so
8829160	8834040	forth but that last part aside despite it not being perfect like not an actual arcade machine
8834040	8838280	that would accept quarters and tokens and have cartridge slots i'm still excited to have the next
8838280	8843880	best thing i do have a two-part question for you all have any of you at a minimum had an opportunity
8843880	8848840	to try the arcade one up version of the neo geo mvs um i'm gonna rephrase that to what we just
8848840	8854600	discussed and if so what are your thoughts on it pros and cons i haven't i didn't even know it was
8854600	8861880	out i thought it was coming out but he did link us to an amazon page where ah okay this item will
8861880	8868840	be released on november 24th so that's the answer none of us have played it yet because we can't it's
8868840	8874920	not out yet um well uh i've seen like video reviews from folks that have are familiar with
8874920	8880680	the mvs and um have played a lot of that through like a super gun or something like that and
8880680	8887400	talking about what it is in it sounds like it's pretty good as far as mimicking the mvs and um
8887400	8894600	the only complaints some people had were like maybe the controller might not be exactly what
8894600	8900280	you want but that's probably could be swapped out part-wise um some of the buttons and everything
8900280	8906440	um some of the graphics filters were kind of annoying like for example they had some where
8907000	8911560	if you wanted certain scan lines in there they only had it with like the graphics smoothing
8911560	8918200	option which is kind of irritating instead of like the pixel perfect option um so you may just
8919160	8924600	some of those issues might be a thing but otherwise it's a pretty good recreation of it
8924600	8929400	i think yeah and just you know i'm gonna have to base my assumption based off of actual arcade
8929400	8934360	one-up machines and what this is trying to emulate i will say number one it has a pretty impressive
8934360	8938120	lineup of games in it you know most of those arcade one-up machines only have five or six
8938120	8942360	games in them which is a problem for some people i'm not so bothered by it i get what they're
8942360	8947080	trying to do with that kind of like limited release but um the neo geo one does sound very
8947080	8952120	robust so there is that and um it's going to be a different you know kind of screen on it from
8952120	8955720	what you remember in the arcades back in the day um but i actually think that makes it more
8955720	8960920	manageable but i think the way you kind of phrased it where it's the next best thing i think is
8960920	8965640	probably going to be appropriate is like it's probably going to be enough for you to kind of
8965640	8970840	invoke those memories of playing it at an arcade you wouldn't want to deal with the quarter stuff
8970840	8975480	and all that stuff well i shouldn't say that i'm not to say who what type of collector people are
8975480	8982440	and so forth but let me rephrase that quarter stuff and token slot and all that that might be
8982440	8987320	more hassle than you think especially if you just want to get in there and play the games so you
8987320	8991640	know what there might actually be an upside to some of this but i i'd be curious to hear your
8991640	8997000	thoughts once you get it all sorted out and this comes in and by the way before anybody says
8997000	9002680	anything about spending a stimulus check on an arcade machine um people can spend the money
9002680	9008040	however they like and there's plenty of people that are spending the stimulus check on vacations
9008040	9013640	and things of that sort so how is this any different um and you know what i it's one of
9013640	9019240	those things where it's like i also totally recognize that like 2020 has been hard on people's
9019240	9024040	mental health across the board so like if this is something that a person can buy to make themselves
9024040	9031080	happy for a day again who am i to judge i ain't so i just wanted to get that out there because
9031080	9035160	i could see how some folks might be kind of asking some questions there and just remember
9035160	9040120	it's not your place to ask that question all right anyway the rest of the email thanks for taking
9040120	9044440	the time to read and answer this email this email is brought to you by the front door of the white
9044440	9049160	house which hopefully will hit drum part on the ass on his way out na na na na na na na hey hey
9049160	9055080	goodbye dances the cabbage patch you can tell this was written shortly after that um election
9055080	9060920	on tuesday yes mr smoosh i'm reading emails did you want to read the next email he's off
9060920	9067480	camera unfortunately but he's sitting here uh giving his opinion all right uh black kompat in
9067480	9074920	chat says retail therapy has been saving grace for me this year same like you know did i need
9074920	9083800	an xbox series x probably not am i happy i bought one yeah so there you go all right uh let's get to
9083800	9089400	one more email which is from yyr and again this is a dated email because of last week's issues
9089400	9094520	hello lr i wanted to weigh in oh by the way before i get into this too far yyr did i saw
9094520	9099560	this on discord i'm sorry i didn't see the stream but he did some type of charity stream today where
9099560	9108680	he was supposed to play max 300 41 times in a row to celebrate or was it 40 or 41 to celebrate
9108680	9116440	turning his age so i i thought that was impressive dude because i i don't even think i've ever been
9117000	9122760	one time yeah um even a nine-footer that's pretty hard that i probably could still do like let's
9122760	9130920	say orion seven eight siv mix right i still like i still remember how those notes go in my head
9130920	9136280	um but and and for some of you probably have no idea what we're talking about this is a ddr thing
9136280	9144200	okay um but uh the fact that he could do that 41 times that in itself is impressive i i hope it
9144200	9149880	went i hope the stream went very well i'm sorry i missed it um sunday's a very busy day oh sj100
9149880	9155720	matt says yyr's birthday is today well happy birthday all right well let's finish the birthday
9155720	9160440	boy's email okay uh i wanted to weigh in on the playstation 5 backwards compatibility issue we
9160440	9164760	were talking about on last week's show again we might be dealing with some dated things because
9164760	9169080	we've had some answered questions since then but let's move on we have a list a short one but a
9169080	9173960	list nonetheless of seemingly random games that we're told won't run on playstation 5 at all
9173960	9178120	we have a disclaimer on every playstation 4 game in the playstation store warning us that there
9178120	9182920	may be issues running it on playstation 5 and now we have ubisoft mentioning then unmentioning
9182920	9188680	issues with some of their ps4 games on ps5 personally for me this adds up to a bad omen i
9188680	9193080	get the sense that the playstation 5's backwards compatibility is going to come with asterisks and
9193080	9197800	kavats and that we're not going to get the full sense of what all these are until the consoles
9197800	9202680	are already in our hands i get the distinct impression that sony did not fully plan for this
9202680	9207160	as microsoft certainly appears to have done and that if someone is looking specifically to play
9207160	9211880	playstation 4 games they should probably buy a playstation 4 rather than bank on the theory that
9211880	9217960	playstation 5 would play them perfectly all of that said i hope to be proven wrong so now we
9217960	9226440	have some answers was yyr wrong i would say not completely because he did say there play them
9226440	9236040	perfectly and we have news it's not perfect but it's playable right so and i think those are some
9236040	9241080	of the nuances that might have caused some of that confusion uh that we got again when when
9241080	9245560	ubisoft to put out that announcement there so there's that's kind of my take on it now that
9245560	9250840	the consoles are out in people's hands is that it's not perfect and if you want to play perfect
9250840	9255720	if you want to play the game it was absolutely meant to be designed for especially if they
9255720	9261080	didn't do an updated release like no man's sky or something you want to play it on a playstation 4
9261080	9268440	and this is you know this is emulation versus the real thing right and there's always going to be
9268440	9273320	people with their strong opinions one way or the other so and fifth dream says that it wants to say
9273320	9279800	that is also on a vast minority of games most games play way better on playstation 5 and
9279800	9285400	especially when you're talking about first party games i'm sure because you know they went in and
9285400	9290840	and made those better or made sure they would work and they would work better anyway to conclude
9290840	9296040	birthday boys email uh thanks again for the show oh and by the way i wasn't kidding when i said to
9296040	9302920	expect a pixel poops announcement soon so please look forward to that have a great week erin or yyr
9302920	9308760	well i'm not what it's been a week where's my announcement all right now i'm excited to see
9308760	9314840	whatever he has in store that's awesome all right that's it for our emails um again looking at chat
9314840	9319400	to see if there's any questions i don't see any questions a lot of people impressed on the max 300
9319400	9324360	thing in chat for what it's worth uh loki do we have any last minute stories tonight um yeah there
9324360	9332360	was one quick thing so apparently some fans have ported over driver 2 to pc which is interesting
9332360	9340120	because it was originally a playstation exclusive um so now they have this open source uh they
9340120	9345560	basic basically pulled a mario 64 on it they reverse engineered the original code and then
9345560	9351320	made an actual proper port of it and they're releasing it just in time for the 20th anniversary
9351320	9359800	so it's called redriver 2 project and it's uh available on github github.com open driver 2
9360280	9367800	redriver 2 it's free by the way which i'm sure is going to get them in trouble so get it while you
9367800	9375080	can all right so um and also i got a text before the show from shane and maybe some of you in chat
9375080	9382840	have more of a grip of what's going on the situation um but apparently uh capcom has had
9382840	9388200	some information leak out um what was what the tech say a ton of capcom leaks just happened it
9388200	9393480	looks like by the way and that did trigger my memory about that last week we had a story i
9393480	9397160	don't remember if we got to it or not it might have been cut because of the internet issue
9397160	9403960	but there was a story about that customer data from capcom had leaked or or yeah apparently uh
9403960	9409960	this is something different so it says uh apparently a group a hacker group has stolen
9409960	9415720	a one terabyte worth of stuff uh but only have leaked 60 gigabytes of it and includes the devil
9415720	9422760	may cry 2 source code umbrella chronicles source code resident evil 4 vr ace attorney collection
9422760	9430600	for playstation 4 and switch is this the same group that did this to nintendo i don't know
9431560	9436120	that's my that's my curiosity yeah and that's what fifth dream is asking as well is uh are all
9436120	9440680	these leaks coming from the same leakers uh i'd be very curious about that because if i was another
9440680	9446680	gaming company right now i would be putting the the the law i mean i'm sure these i mean nintendo
9446680	9450840	you would think would be secure as it is in capcom so i don't know how they're getting in if they're
9450840	9455880	doing social engineering or what they're doing to get into this stuff but if i was a gaming company
9455880	9461080	i would be looking at my security policies real good right now because this is uh you know and
9461080	9466760	this again puts us in this weird ethical gray area where i don't think it's necessarily right
9466760	9472520	to be spreading all of this stuff that is hacked but it's all over social media it can't be avoided
9472520	9479320	it is what gamers are talking about so i just hope video game companies are are trying to take the
9479320	9483640	steps they needs that they don't suffer the same fate this is really rough i don't know what else
9483640	9489640	to say um fifth dream says what i understand some of these leaks happened years ago they're just
9489640	9495320	dribbling them out uh bob coffee says nintendo's if i recall correctly was leaked via a chinese
9495320	9501640	company that did the iq devices not nintendo proper well it's still you know what anytime
9501640	9506040	you have vendor agreements or whatever it is you got to make sure that stuff is on lockdown it's
9506040	9511160	it's any game company if you know what i don't know how many people we have out there still
9511160	9518360	listening that work in the game industry but i would be so curious if your company and i realize
9518360	9523160	y'all can't really tell me but you know you can tell me on the down low if you want um i would be
9523160	9527880	so curious if your company doesn't blast some sort of security information this week or if if
9527880	9533240	it hasn't already in the last couple weeks some sort of training everybody has to take on security
9533240	9540440	or changed measures or whatever just to make sure that this doesn't happen to the next company
9540440	9548760	because that's two big ones now and that's uh that's an oof for sure so all right anything else
9548840	9553720	we should talk about loki or is that it i think that's it i'm sure we'll hire more about that
9553720	9558520	next week yeah the capcom thing i it's it's we it's it's such an ethical gray area but i
9559240	9565640	if it catches wind and it's all over social media i feel like you know we have to talk about it
9565640	9570200	because that's the type of thing that people would be talking about at the dinner table um but yeah
9570200	9575080	it's just i think we have to take the approach of how do we prevent this from happening again if it
9575080	9579960	hasn't already uh from the comments of you know this could have happened to a ton of sites already
9581720	9586280	all right uh let's get to some final thoughts and wrap it up for the night um thank you guys for
9586280	9591400	tuning in uh to another episode of orange launch radio and being here especially uh at the launch

9676760	9683400	few things that have should have been easy that aren't easy so i'm just working on getting through
9683400	9689320	that and then my goal is to get once i have all of the gameplay loop done that's just all creating
9689320	9695320	levels and that'll make it much easier level content is much easier than having to develop
9695320	9700680	the game systems um quick request from chat and i apologize to the podcast listeners because this
9700680	9705640	isn't going to be great but she hulk 10 says let's see loki's shirt we can see the part that says
