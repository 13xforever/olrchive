00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,240
This week, the never-ending flame wars and battle of console supremacy continues!

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,640
It's a new console generation, and I hope you have the console where your friends play

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,640
and library exists.

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,000
After all, it's your choice for your own reasons.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,760
Never forget the immoral words of your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki that

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,040
a console is only as good as the games that are on it, which this generation includes

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,280
the games you previously owned still being compatible on the new consoles.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,280
We'll discuss this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,280
where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:45,640
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,160
every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,160
We are back once again with another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

13
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,600
Live tonight with episode number 844 of our show for November the 22nd of 2020.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,660
My name is Rob Roberts, and I am joined by my co-hosts.

15
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,120
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

16
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,120
Hello.

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,240
Hi, how are you?

18
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,240
I'm well.

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,240
Good.

20
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,200
I'm going to come back to you in a minute though, because we have some more stuff to

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,200
discuss.

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,200
Exactly.

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,200
Okay.

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Say hello.

25
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,300
And I said before the show I was going to do it differently, but 18-year-old habits

26
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,860
are hard to break.

27
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,140
So please also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

28
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,980
Hey, how's it going?

29
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:28,980
Hey, good.

30
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,980
How are you?

31
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,980
Doing all right.

32
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,980
Good.

33
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,980
What's that game behind you tonight?

34
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:33,980
Was that Uniracers?

35
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,980
It's kind of what it looks like.

36
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,980
It is Uniracers.

37
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:36,980
Rad.

38
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,460
I was refreshing it because there was a nice banner ad for some sort of, I see a berry

39
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,460
thing.

40
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,460
I was like, nope.

41
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,460
All right.

42
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,460
Well, that's okay.

43
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,460
That's okay.

44
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,460
Oh, that's another banner ad.

45
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,460
Cool.

46
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,460
That's the Nintendo 64 version.

47
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,460
Isn't it?

48
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,460
I don't know if I ever played.

49
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,460
Super Nintendo.

50
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,460
Okay.

51
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,460
It is Super Nintendo.

52
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,060
Is it Uniracers 64?

53
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,060
Am I making that up?

54
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,060
No.

55
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,060
Then you're making that up.

56
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,060
I am totally making that up.

57
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,060
Why did I think there was a second Uniracers game?

58
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,780
Maybe you're thinking of Excitebike.

59
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,780
Was it on Game Boy?

60
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,780
I don't know.

61
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,540
No, I'm definitely not thinking of Excitebike.

62
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,340
I don't remember if there was a Game Boy version of Uniracers.

63
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,820
There might've been, but no, it was only on Super Nintendo.

64
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,540
All right.

65
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,180
Before we get into our kickoff topic tonight, which is going to be about a game we've talked

66
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,140
about a little bit on this show before.

67
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,560
I want to go back to Dark Sakura tonight because we've been talking the past couple of weeks

68
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:35,700
about you are a fan of the show Supernatural, which has a pretty impressive run.

69
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:44,460
It's not quite as impressive as the run of this show at 18 years, but 15 years, great

70
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:51,580
minds think like me, 15 years of a one TV show is certainly no slouch.

71
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,340
You and I were talking a little bit before the show tonight, a finale was met with some

72
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,700
mixed kind of feelings.

73
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,340
By the way, on cam, I have baby.

74
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,340
I don't even know what that is.

75
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,580
Do they have a Batmobile type of thing?

76
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,580
Is that what that is?

77
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,580
It's the Impala.

78
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,580
It's the baby.

79
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,180
I think I've maybe ever seen one episode.

80
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,820
It's a lot to catch up on, but I will say Dark Sakura, it wasn't your endorsement that

81
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,020
made me want to watch Supernatural.

82
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,580
Do you know who endorsed Supernatural that now I want to watch it?

83
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,580
Stacey Abrams.

84
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:32,420
Well, yeah, I think the entire fandom let out a big gasp when they found she was a fan.

85
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,740
She's clearly a sci-fi nerd and I'm living for it.

86
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,740
Yeah, totally.

87
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:43,540
I've really been enjoying following her on Twitter lately, but yeah, my favorite show

88
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:50,260
that I've watched since the first episode that a lot of the milestones I've had as a

89
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,340
host of Orange Lounge Radio, I have had as a fan of Supernatural as well, including getting

90
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:03,500
married and losing a cat and getting another cat and all of our milestones.

91
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:09,860
I'd also like to say that for me, because I'm only a couple of years older than Jensen

92
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:15,660
Ackles who plays Dean, that I have grown up with the characters and so it was kind

93
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:22,500
of for me watching the characters grow as people and me growing, it made logical sense.

94
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,100
I could stay with that aspect.

95
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,100
Does that make sense?

96
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,100
Oh yeah, no, absolutely.

97
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,460
You know, and somebody, I had tweeted a little plug for the show tonight as I tend to do

98
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,900
on my personal Twitter account and somebody was kind enough to reply.

99
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,860
It was Sy Coon on Twitter replied and said, do you remember that name?

100
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,060
I remember from chat a long time ago said, oh, LR was a formative part of my youth and

101
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,420
I still love them to pieces.

102
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,020
Go have a listen pals.

103
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:49,540
And I was like, oh, that's, that's why I still do this shit every week is nice comments like

104
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,540
that.

105
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,540
It's very kind.

106
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,180
I do also want to introduce our chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night

107
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,500
at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash

108
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,500
vog network.

109
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,660
And you guys can participate along with our show.

110
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:07,580
First comment tonight from Kevin DDR who says, oh, LR outlasting supernatural is truly

111
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,300
an accomplishment.

112
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,300
Thank you.

113
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,860
At the end, there can be only one.

114
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,620
So there's another like big thing that's happening next week.

115
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,820
So the ready player twos coming out and I was reading, I was like trying to re read

116
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,580
some reviews on it and they're all, yeah, it's nine years in the making.

117
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:28,620
Like it's been nine years or he's cheese, but time flies.

118
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,620
Seriously.

119
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:35,060
Um, yeah, I was just going to ask you because we were talking a little bit before the show

120
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,020
about supernatural and kind of the fandom reaction and, and you know, I know this is

121
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,500
a show about video games, but I definitely saw some parallels, uh, in a not great way,

122
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,060
unfortunately, to kind of what you were talking about with some of the stuff in the supernatural

123
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,420
fandom and things that we've seen in the gaming fandom.

124
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:56,500
And you know, we're talking about history and things that have changed in 15 years or

125
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,260
18 years, depending on what show we're talking about right now.

126
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:06,980
Um, one of those things that is kind of better and worse is the fact that you can reach out

127
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,020
to people so instantaneously on social media.

128
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,220
I mean, when this show started, we didn't have Twitter and some of that stuff.

129
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,820
And in some ways they, thank gosh.

130
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,820
Right.

131
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,100
But Jamie, you want to elaborate on that a little bit?

132
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,060
Like what's, what's the supernatural fandom going through?

133
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:28,540
Well, a lot of people are, are kind of up in arms over the ending, um, that, you know,

134
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:32,940
there were characters slighted that the way that it ended in shit, I really don't want

135
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:39,460
to spoil it, but the way that it was ended, denied certain aspects of characters that

136
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:46,180
it ruined character arcs and, and me, I personally, I don't see that I, I thought it was, it was

137
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,820
right the way that it ended.

138
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:55,860
But we've now had so much, just, I don't even have a word for it.

139
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,260
Just people who have been, we've gone from the flat out and I'm looking at some of it

140
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:06,020
as grief, you know, cause people keep, people can grieve over the stuff that they love that

141
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,860
that's appropriate, but I'm, you know, we still have a lot of the denial and, Oh, it

142
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,420
should have been this way and let's petition to have their, their, the petitions already

143
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,420
out by the way.

144
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:21,220
Um, but like one of my favorite actors who was just a glorious human being, Jim Beaver,

145
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:27,820
he was chased off of Twitter because, you know, and I don't even think that a lot of

146
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:36,140
what was going at him was, uh, was necessarily badly worded or attacking, but it was so many,

147
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,260
you know what I mean?

148
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:42,660
When you have a lot of people saying the same thing and not all of them are mature about

149
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,020
it, it'll really come across as bullying.

150
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,020
It's overwhelming.

151
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,020
Yeah.

152
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:52,500
Um, and um, you know, people are now going on IMDB and leaving poor reviews.

153
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,780
And the thing with that is that a lot of them are making light of mental illness and suicide

154
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,580
and every last one of them I've run across, I have reported because you don't fuck with

155
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,580
those topics.

156
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,580
You do not.

157
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:09,220
Um, but especially when I have friends that would be with me today, if they hadn't taken

158
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,220
their lives.

159
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:22,660
Um, there, uh, there've been just, just anywhere from just, you know, basic whining to really

160
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,660
good conversation.

161
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:28,500
The really good conversation is what I have been, uh, been happiest with.

162
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:37,580
Um, and, uh, there have also been, I'd say discussions about, you know, really good discussions

163
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:43,380
that have come out about sexuality, about, um, representation, you know, arguing out

164
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:51,420
against the kill your gays trope, which, um, I, I half see it and half don't, and I can

165
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,420
go into that.

166
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:58,180
Um, when I post my blog post, um, because there's going to be a blog post, I actually

167
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,180
could not post Friday night.

168
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,580
Um, well, cause number one, um, I was in Reno.

169
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,220
I'm sure there's many blog posts that are being written about the finale, not just,

170
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,220
you know, I wasn't in Reno.

171
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,420
I just come back from Reno.

172
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:16,020
Um, but, but no, I am going to be, because also some of my perspective on it does come,

173
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:23,980
I think a little bit just from being autistic that I don't, I have an emotional investment,

174
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,900
but not an emotional expectation, if that makes sense.

175
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:32,980
I'm really looking at it more as the, the details as opposed to what emotion it evoked.

176
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,980
Does that make sense?

177
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,860
So it was like, how I feel about it is irrelevant in regards to how it actually was.

178
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,100
And so my feelings are in that region.

179
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,780
Let me get some comments from our chat over Twitch TV slash VOG network.

180
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,820
Um, Sia Tabiri in chat says, if anyone is really that sore about things, they could

181
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,860
always look for screen manipulations or fan fix.

182
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,220
You know, um, I think that's an interesting way to kind of deal with it.

183
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,820
And the way I would prefer to see people deal with it rather than bullying is that if you

184
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,140
don't like the ending, write your own damn ending.

185
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,660
I mean, it's not going to do anything to change what happened on TV, but at least you kind

186
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,260
of release that from your system.

187
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,180
And that's something you can share with other people who can then choose to accept it or

188
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,180
reject it.

189
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,420
You know, that's, that's the great things about stories.

190
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,260
You can either let it affect you or not.

191
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,260
Right.

192
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,300
Well, and see, that's the thing.

193
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:27,380
And for me, I'm, I'm very, I'm not, you know, the big thing was the Destiel shippers, right?

194
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,740
You know, uh, Dean and Castiel, which I'm not one of them.

195
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,500
I mean, if, if it ended up had being a hundred percent canon, then, okay, cool.

196
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,500
You know, I didn't see it coming, you know, maybe one-sidedly, but it is what it is.

197
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:47,860
Um, I also don't get whatever subtext that people are pointing at, but again, that could

198
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,660
just be because I'm autistic.

199
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,260
We don't really usually get that kind of subtext.

200
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:59,420
I mean, just as people, you know, um, but I thought that within the scope of what they

201
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,020
had available, it was, it was very well done.

202
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,020
I was pleased with it.

203
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:08,500
I was satisfied and I cried like a baby, which is great because, and I might've even mentioned

204
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,500
it in the past.

205
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,560
I haven't really been able to cry even after my dad died, um, with everything going on.

206
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,740
It just would not come out.

207
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:24,220
And like with, uh, with episode 18, I could cry some with episode 20, I bawled and every

208
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,620
time I go back and watch any scene, I, I cry.

209
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,140
And it's been really good for me because now I know what to do.

210
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:36,300
If I need to cry, I just go back and watch some of those scenes, you know, um,

211
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,780
Isn't that interesting when, when art evokes that type of response because, you know, going

212
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:45,080
to games and not to spoil my gaming week, but surprise, I was playing No Man's Sky this

213
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,740
week and it was a very random thing that happened in the game, but it was something that made

214
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,140
me think about my mom.

215
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,380
And I did start like welling up a little bit and, you know, I get through most days now

216
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:59,960
not crying, you know, that all kind of stopped in 2017 when she passed, but there's definitely

217
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,420
little moments in art that will evoke that type of response.

218
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:09,180
So it's interesting, you know, and, and that can also be TV shows or movies.

219
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:14,140
Even thinking about it right now, this is the first time I've actually talked to somebody

220
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:19,220
verbally that is not Dan and, and Dan's not like the biggest fan of the show.

221
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,300
He's caught episodes with me, but you know, we, we had to talk about it.

222
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,380
But I found his observations to be astute.

223
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:33,260
But the biggest thing I kept thinking of reading everything on, on Twitter, cause I've basically

224
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,900
I've been living on Twitter lately just because I've noticed you've, you've had an increased

225
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,820
Twitter presence from where we were a year ago for sure.

226
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,780
And I actually really, really enjoy the platform a lot more.

227
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,940
I don't really do the list so much.

228
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:49,220
I kind of like the randomness to come to me and then I check on certain people in person.

229
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:56,140
But for, for me, the biggest parallel that would just really struck out to me was the

230
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:01,380
Mass Effect 3 ending, how people acted about that to the point where they actually did

231
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:10,900
go in and do a revised-ish ending, you know, have the various endings for it.

232
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:20,100
And I just thought that it was, I just, it just seemed like, Hey, I've, I've heard this

233
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,100
song before.

234
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,260
I've seen the same exact thing happen.

235
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:33,180
And you know I was actually really happy enough and lucky enough that I could attend some

236
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,420
of the, the Q and A panels that Creation Entertainment has done in light of not being able to have

237
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,420
conventions.

238
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:44,020
They usually are the ones that run like the various supernatural cons.

239
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:53,700
And so today was the, the panel this morning with Misha Collins that played Castiel and

240
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,660
then with Jared Padlucki who played Sam.

241
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,020
And I really liked what they had to say about it.

242
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,260
I've recorded both of them.

243
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,860
I'm planning on making them available at some point.

244
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:12,420
But I really enjoyed the insights they got sort of behind the scenes as the actors behind

245
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:17,860
it and speaking of representation and, and how it went and talking about, you know, their

246
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:23,220
own feelings about the ending, which honestly I would a hundred percent see it.

247
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:32,620
And by the way, Brad, pod culture in chat, that actually I think was absolutely necessary.

248
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,900
Please elaborate for our podcast listeners who can't see chat.

249
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:42,460
He said the part I hated fucking rebar that a lot of people are kind of sticking on that

250
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,460
point.

251
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,460
And honestly enough, it's not the rebar that did it.

252
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,740
It's the attacker that did it.

253
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,980
It just happened to be there.

254
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:57,860
And so, which by the way is always how I, I saw that going.

255
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:03,660
And there's lots of parallels to something that happened in, I want to say season three.

256
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:10,500
Yeah, it was not season three, um, in, uh, in season two, um, but, uh, I won't go into

257
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,500
that here.

258
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,500
I won't go into that here.

259
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,500
Yeah.

260
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,300
Bobby suggesting you do a vog round table on the finale because clearly there's a lot

261
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,420
more to say.

262
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,420
I think you should do it.

263
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,420
Absolutely.

264
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,420
Get some people together.

265
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,420
Yeah.

266
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,700
Um, we'll, we'll, we'll see about that happening, um, when I don't have 50 million things going

267
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,700
on.

268
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,820
Can I get together a couple listener comments here and then we can move on?

269
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,820
Sure.

270
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,380
Um, so this must be one of your Twitter buddies.

271
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:36,340
I don't recognize this name, but SV writer 1000 says, I cried a lot also, LOL, or I'm

272
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,340
sorry.

273
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,340
I cried.

274
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,340
Also, I answered a word there.

275
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,340
LOL.

276
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,420
It was a long time coming for me and I'm going to miss this show.

277
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,420
So you're not alone.

278
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,140
I am a million percent with you on that.

279
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,380
I yeah, I'm tying it to games again a little bit.

280
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,380
SSG 100.

281
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,260
Matt says it's like folks attack the mass effect crew after they didn't like the ending

282
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,540
of three threats, downloading the game on platforms.

283
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,300
It's just not necessary, no matter how important a fandom it is to you.

284
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,300
Absolutely.

285
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,900
And I think that's probably the note we'd want to kind of try to wrap this up on is

286
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:12,420
that, you know, that these types of responses are just like, it's, it's too much, you know,

287
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:17,900
if you don't like something, okay, you know, but somebody else might've liked it, you know,

288
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,900
I don't know.

289
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,900
Yeah.

290
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,980
Well, and see, that, that's the thing is that right now I just watching the fandom in general

291
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:29,060
and you know, I've saw the same thing happening with mass effect that people are going through

292
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,300
the stages of grief.

293
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:36,340
I mean, eventually the acceptance is going to happen but you know, that's why I've been

294
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,380
really encouraging people.

295
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,220
You know, I started writing a fanfic.

296
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,180
I mean, now my fanfic is within the set canon.

297
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:51,500
So it follows the ending as it portrayed on, on TV.

298
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:57,940
But for me, I'm working out a few things in my, in my fanfic.

299
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,220
I've already written a chapter of it.

300
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,900
I wrote that chapter in like, I banged that out in like a couple hours.

301
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:12,500
So it, I've seen some really beautiful fan art come of it.

302
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,540
I mean, the same thing happened, you know, I wrote my own fanfics for mass effect after

303
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,540
the end.

304
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:25,660
Cause to me, you know, my, my canon in mass effect for the ending is where Shepard lives,

305
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,660
you know?

306
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:33,420
And I wrote like what three, four different fanfics around that ending, you know?

307
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:42,260
So I really would encourage any any of my my Twitter buddies who are listening to the

308
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:49,020
podcast right now I would really encourage you that with your, with your feelings about

309
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:53,620
this, with how you're doing it, put it into something creative, which I do need to interject

310
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,620
one last thing.

311
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,620
All right.

312
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:03,860
That a bunch of fans, you know, in, you know that's what I'm thinking of just in their

313
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:10,420
reaction to wanting to do something when they could not do anything about the ending, right?

314
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:16,860
They gathered, they raised a lot of money for the Trevor project.

315
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,980
Like the goal was something like 800 bucks and it's now almost a 2000 nice.

316
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:28,700
And I'll find, I'll find the, the link to the charity but I, it's called like Castile

317
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,700
something.

318
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,180
I'll have to look it up again.

319
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:38,580
So I will find that again and I'll, I'll put it in the chat here and I'll see about reposting

320
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,580
it again on my Twitter.

321
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,700
I posted about it a few times, but to take the seat and that's what should have been

322
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,700
done with Mass Effect.

323
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,900
That should be done anytime the fandom is in arms and is upset about something.

324
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,760
Take your energy and funnel it into something positive.

325
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,980
I was just so proud of the Supernatural family for doing that.

326
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:01,280
I was just going to say it's interesting that you brought up specifically the Trevor project

327
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,300
because, um, I was, you know, just messing around on my new Xbox series X that I talked

328
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,960
about last week on the show.

329
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,840
And you know, Xbox has their own little like rewards app and rewards thing that you can

330
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,840
do.

331
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,840
Um, and one of the, uh, things that's in there right now is that you can spend 1000 points

332
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,640
to basically donate a dollar to the Trevor project and Microsoft will match that.

333
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,120
And specifically that charity is in there and was called out.

334
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,620
I noticed it was like a featured thing in the Xbox rewards app.

335
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,100
So I thought that was pretty cool.

336
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,100
Check that out.

337
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,400
And you can actually, they have a way you can earn a thousand points really easy just

338
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,880
by getting two achievements too.

339
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,960
So it's pretty cool.

340
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,640
So I found it, by the way, I'm going to put the link in the, in the chat cause it's kind

341
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,160
of a long one, but if you just look up the Castiel project, okay.

342
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,440
So I was actually wrong.

343
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,720
The goal was 1500 and we've raised $46,220 for the Trevor project.

344
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,720
Nice.

345
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,720
All right.

346
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,720
All right.

347
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:01,200
Well, blowing that out of the water by 40 by was 400%.

348
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
Almost 400%.

349
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
All right.

350
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,440
All right.

351
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,760
Well clearly you're going to need a three hour round table to get out all your thoughts

352
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,920
on the supernatural finale.

353
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:15,080
I'm just saying that, you know, my last piece is just do, do, do what these fans have done.

354
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,080
Funnel it into something good.

355
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,480
Funnel it into something good.

356
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,480
And that's a message that can be used on gaming and all that as well to kind of tie it back.

357
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,480
All right.

358
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,480
Indeed.

359
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:30,600
Well, speaking, speaking of gaming, sorry, choking live on air.

360
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:36,000
Um, Loki, why don't you take our kickoff topic story off my hands tonight, please?

361
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,400
Cause it's a game we talk a lot about on this show.

362
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
Yeah.

363
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:44,120
So Pokemon go had a major update that, uh, did a bunch of things.

364
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:50,520
So first off they added a level cap, um, they increased the level cap up to 50, which is

365
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,520
pretty awesome.

366
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:57,600
Um, they are also introducing seasons that change every three months, uh, which will

367
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,640
do introduce, I guess, new Pokemon, uh, exclusive to those seasons as well.

368
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:13,360
Um, and they're also introducing new monsters that were part of, uh, the Kalos region.

369
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,480
And so they've added a bunch of those as well.

370
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:21,240
Gen six, Pokemon X and Y, some of them sit with me here in the OLR studio actually, except

371
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,240
they're on the other side, so I can't grab them, but some of them are with me here in

372
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,240
the OLR studio.

373
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,560
It's those starters from X and Y.

374
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,720
So just kind of, uh, you know, all these updates all at once, and it's going to be coming out

375
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,240
on November 30th is when that's going to hit.

376
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,680
So I'm pretty cool.

377
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
Lots of cool stuff.

378
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:44,800
Um, they're also going to be a special badge if you have hit 40 already, uh, once the update

379
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,640
hits and you'll be able to get that.

380
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,820
So it's a legacy.

381
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:58,660
And then I guess starting December 2nd, they're also going to have, um, some special French,

382
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,020
uh, Pokemon as well.

383
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,020
Uh, Klefki.

384
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,460
Uh, yeah, it's like another regional.

385
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:09,580
You can only get it in France because that's what Pokemon X and Y was inspired by.

386
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,280
They did something similar for, um, New York city in Gen five.

387
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:17,380
There's like a bowl you can only get in New York city, um, or that area.

388
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,420
It's actually pretty generous.

389
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,380
It's not just New York city, but that area.

390
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,380
Yeah.

391
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,060
So it sounds exciting.

392
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:27,340
I turned it on the other day just to, cause I haven't played in a while.

393
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:32,740
So there was a few new Pokemon I was able to get, but still not really playing it.

394
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:38,260
Um, some of the requirements to get to level 50 are coming out already because the game

395
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:43,220
is, um, uh, already went live with that in like Australia or some parts of Australia

396
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,180
and some other parts of the world that always kind of get to test this type of stuff.

397
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:51,220
So of course, Reddit is all over the information gathering and all this stuff, just to give

398
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,780
you an idea of what it takes to get to level 41.

399
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,920
All right.

400
00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:00,500
So to get to get from zero to 40, 20 million XP total will get you there.

401
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,500
All right.

402
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,980
So, but if you want to get to 41, you'll have to get that bar up to 26, you have to get

403
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:12,340
6 million more XP and you'll have to power up a legendary Pokemon 20 times.

404
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,140
Eh, you can do that, winning enough, winning enough raids and getting the rare candy.

405
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,220
Win 30 raids.

406
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,220
That's going to take a little time.

407
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,120
You got to find 30 raids to play.

408
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,700
If you're only using the free passes, that's going to take you a month.

409
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:31,620
And here's the big one, catch 200 Pokemon in a single day.

410
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,300
And that is the requirements to get to 41.

411
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,300
Don't we all have lives?

412
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:41,020
Well, I mean, I think I can do it with my Bluetooth, but this is definitely the kind

413
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,620
of thing where you would have to grind the game for like four or five hours just to get

414
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,620
to 41.

415
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,900
And you know, the interesting question is why?

416
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:57,860
Because anybody who's level 40 will be able to power up Pokemon all the way to level 50,

417
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,460
which will also be the new level cap for your Pokemon.

418
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:05,940
It used to be that you could only level Pokemon one level higher than you are now.

419
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,060
But now they're going to make it so that you can level Pokemon up to 10 levels higher than

420
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,120
you are now.

421
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:18,380
So really, the only point to get to level 41, 42, 43 and so forth is E-peen.

422
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,920
There's really not a lot of other point that I saw anyway.

423
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:26,040
I don't know, chatters, if you have an opinion on why would you even get to 50 outside of

424
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:32,300
showing off your, you know, pokey dick, then I'm curious what the reasons are, because

425
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,440
I'm not sure.

426
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:40,760
And just, you know, they only have the requirements up to level 46 right now, because level 46

427
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:46,400
has a take a snapshot of Pokemon seven days in a row requirement.

428
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,360
So it's it's time gated to a week.

429
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,380
So they like physically can't get past it yet to see what's beyond 46.

430
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:58,120
But do you know how much experience you need to get to level 46 82 million total?

431
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:04,680
No, not saying the game one to 20 is the end of the game right now.

432
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:10,880
You're going to have to go through the current game four times to get to level 46.

433
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,200
Now with as much as I've played Pokemon go on and off over the years, I've gone the one

434
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,320
through 40 twice, I have about 42 million XP.

435
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,880
That is just enough to get me to level 43 if I do all the tasks.

436
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,880
So I don't know.

437
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:31,560
I know like on one hand, the new levels sound interesting on the other, I feel like it's

438
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,720
an episode of whose line it is it anyway, where it's all made up and the points don't

439
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,040
matter.

440
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:42,220
To me, it sounds just like Ingress where like I got stuck not being able to level up to

441
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:47,400
another level because you had certain requirements that you have to hit, I could never hit him

442
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,520
to get enough silver badges or whatever gold badges.

443
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,180
So Oh, technically, that's in this I left that out.

444
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,380
But you're going to have to have a certain number of gold and now platinum there's new

445
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:02,700
badges coming platinum badges in order to be able to get to certain levels and it's

446
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,420
it didn't look too bad to me.

447
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,420
But I don't know.

448
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:10,300
I also have a lot of history and Pokemon go so whatever.

449
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,420
By the way, I guess I should mention this at some point since you brought up Ingress.

450
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,860
I haven't played Ingress in eight days.

451
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,900
I think I'm I think I'm kind of over it.

452
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,280
Some stuff happened.

453
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,660
And I'm just kind of like, what am I doing this for again?

454
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:26,980
Like Oh, yeah, it's been very motivating to go out and walk and do some of that other

455
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,980
stuff.

456
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,900
But honestly, like the game is getting stale.

457
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,180
It's hemorrhaging a lot of players.

458
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:38,300
And even though it's probably the player base is maybe a quarter of what it used to be at

459
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:43,020
one point, Niantic still can't seem to be able to police their own game and make sure

460
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,060
it's fair.

461
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,660
So I kind of hit a point where I'm like, I've had it yet.

462
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:51,220
I just turned right around and started playing Pokemon go so I get so it's like, I guess

463
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:56,020
I'm still kind of Niantic but my my thing is I'm not going to give it any money.

464
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,820
I'm done a different kind of game.

465
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,700
Well, you know what I do is they've got that whole Google app.

466
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,980
It's a Google rewards or whatever.

467
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,220
And so you take pictures of your receipts when you go shopping and of course they steal

468
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,220
your data that way.

469
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,500
But is that on iOS?

470
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,060
I always thought that was an Android only thing.

471
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,300
Oh, I don't know.

472
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,300
But it's on Android.

473
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,660
I've got like, I get like at least a buck a week.

474
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:24,620
So and it's just, you know, I could use it for in game stuff if I was actually playing

475
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:30,180
Pokemon go, but I don't so but it's a cheap way to do it.

476
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:35,420
Just I'll just I'll just be a bigger deck on the gym game and Pokemon go I've usually

477
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,300
been very passive in that game, but I'll get my 50 coins.

478
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,120
So Ingress taught me how to be a territorial dickhead.

479
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,420
So I'll do it.

480
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:50,540
Somebody tried it with me today and Pokemon God was feeding golden berries to their Pokemon

481
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,540
that was still in the gym.

482
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,860
Well, I noticed this person was in another gym down the street.

483
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,900
So I use the good old Ingers trick attack at once.

484
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,100
And while they're sitting there like waiting to recharge it when you attack it again, you

485
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,240
go take the other gym down the street.

486
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,220
And I fucking did it today is somebody.

487
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,100
So you know what?

488
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:12,260
I guess Niantic has unleashed the beast if nothing else will say that.

489
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:16,700
So also don't knock my I would have never done it if this person had to knock me out

490
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,980
of a gym in less than 10 minutes.

491
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,900
I didn't get a single coin from the gym because they knocked me right out and I was like oh

492
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,180
hell no.

493
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:28,500
So yeah act deft and chat says territorial asshole the game.

494
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,980
Fifth Dream says territorial asshole goose game.

495
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:36,660
I'm sure the person I am like completely asserting dominance over is probably like a 13 year

496
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,140
old.

497
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,500
But you know what kid life's not fair.

498
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,140
There you go.

499
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:47,580
Get used to being beat down and yeah.

500
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,980
Yeah.

501
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:54,420
If you think I mean wait until you have to deal with a bank and a job anyway.

502
00:28:54,420 --> 00:29:01,240
SSG100 Matt says if you drop incense and stay home you can get 200 Pokemon fine.

503
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,240
That is true.

504
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:09,020
Pokemon Go did roll back the excuse me roll front the the COVID-19 restrictions they had

505
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,200
previously removed from the game.

506
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,200
Those are back.

507
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,200
So that's good.

508
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,180
Probably not a good take when a lot you know when we're having the largest spike ever in

509
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:21,740
the well no no they they they implement they remember how they took those things away.

510
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:27,140
They put them back like two days ago so I'm saying like they made that choice and everybody

511
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,880
started locking down even more and they're like oh yeah.

512
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,960
Are you saying the recent spike in COVID cases is Niantic's fault.

513
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,160
What I'm saying is it's Ingress's fault.

514
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:44,660
And sure I don't know what I'm saying is that you know perhaps you know they kind of got

515
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:50,360
a clue when you know California which I think is where their headquarters is locked down

516
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:58,080
and they're like oh maybe maybe perhaps we should you know bring all that stuff back.

517
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,080
Stay safe everybody.

518
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,260
It's it's crazy crazy out there right now.

519
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:05,920
So all right yeah if you are going to play Pokemon Go and stuff just make sure you're

520
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,820
doing it the right way.

521
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:11,260
I mean I went out and did community day over the weekend I guess I'm getting into my gaming

522
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,260
week but whatever.

523
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:18,140
I went out and did community day on Saturday and honestly I didn't run into anybody.

524
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:23,100
It was pretty empty at the Capitol and I imagine having a six hour window is nice with that.

525
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:28,160
My other understanding is that there was some type of political rally that turned into fist

526
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,740
fighting that had been broken up before I got there.

527
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,540
So maybe that helped clear the area of people because I was like wow nobody's around and

528
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,780
everything's fenced off.

529
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:40,380
This is really pleasant today.

530
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:48,480
So anyway let's see going to some comments from our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network

531
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,500
bonds 006 says going to Central Park with incense can also rake in 200 Pokemon.

532
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,040
The issue would be food restrooms and battery power.

533
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,780
Yeah just you know have your plan for 200 Pokemon.

534
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:02,200
I I think it's doable but you got to be dedicated.

535
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:07,680
But again I think you have to ask yourself the very hard question I've asked myself with

536
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:14,780
a lot of games recently which is why or do you need to be level 41 or 50 or whatever

537
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:22,340
it is only Sonic and chat says Pokemon Go still is an opening on my iOS 14 phone WTF.

538
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,340
I run the same.

539
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:27,240
I run the most current iOS like fourteen point one or two whatever they're out on right

540
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,420
now and it's it's fine.

541
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,220
So not sure if it's a log in issue what's going on.

542
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:37,660
Try uninstalling it and then reinstalling it the classic off and on again type of switch.

543
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,440
You'd be surprised I might sound like I'm talking down or so I'm really not.

544
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,700
It is a very obvious yet not so obvious fix sometimes.

545
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,620
So all right anyway.

546
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,620
Let's move on.

547
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,800
We're dipping into our gaming weeks.

548
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,360
So let's talk about our gaming weeks.

549
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,880
How was your gaming week.

550
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,820
Before we get to that actually I want to make sure I plug a certain something something

551
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:06,420
because today is very special because we just launched here at VOG Network a brand new merchandise

552
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,980
store that are that are that are.

553
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:15,000
So you know it's obviously I never am going to sit here and go you need to give us money.

554
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,380
No you don't.

555
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,980
But I'm always very thankful when people do decide to do the subscriptions and the bits

556
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,980
and all that good stuff.

557
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,620
It's very very nice.

558
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:26,220
And you know we do spend money on hosting the Web site.

559
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,940
There's a lot of like legal fees and things because VOG Network is an actual business.

560
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:34,220
Hopefully next year we can get into sponsoring conventions again to help get the word out

561
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,240
about our shows and so on and so on.

562
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,500
And for a long time you guys have been asking where can I get a VOG Network t-shirt please

563
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,240
let me buy a VOG Network t-shirt.

564
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,820
Well good news you can now buy a VOG Network t-shirt and you just can go over to VOG network

565
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:53,060
dot com slash shop is the right word I believe Bobby Black Wolf because I said the right

566
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:57,900
I said store earlier but I think Bobby is making both redirect.

567
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:03,160
He's Rob proofing the URL but VOG network dot com slash shop will take you to the brand

568
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,700
new merch store where you can.

569
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,800
I think what's in there right now there's a Bobby Black Wolf mug.

570
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,900
There are three different types of shirts in there and there is some face masks.

571
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,900
How appropriate for the season.

572
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,260
Unfortunately there was no black.

573
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,900
There were no black face mask.

574
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,980
They only offer the face masks in white.

575
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:22,860
But thankfully we do have a white version of the VOG logo or it's actually black.

576
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,860
You know what I'm saying.

577
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,760
So it works on a piece of the white stuff.

578
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,620
So and if you like the VOG logo say thank you to Dark Sakura because she made that like

579
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:35,700
what eight years ago at this point whenever this network started was eight years ago I

580
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,700
lost track.

581
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,700
I'm old.

582
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,700
Yeah something like that.

583
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,700
All right.

584
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:44,740
So VOG network dot com slash shop if you actually buy it during the show it will scroll along

585
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:48,980
the bottom and say Rob Roberts just bought a VOG network mask.

586
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,720
So I mean that may be incentive or decent.

587
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,820
You don't.

588
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,860
It's an optional part.

589
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,540
If you don't fill it out I don't think it shows anything.

590
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,040
So just a heads up on that.

591
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,700
So if you're like I don't want people to know what I'm buying then don't fill that part

592
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,580
out at the bottom and it won't scroll anything at all.

593
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,820
So but thank you of course for your support.

594
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,820
Really appreciate it.

595
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:12,180
I'm not going to pimp that all the time or every week but we are going to look at trying

596
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:15,300
to add stuff to it as well.

597
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,740
Perhaps you'd like an O.L.R. or an Orange Lounge radio specific piece of merch.

598
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:22,020
We're working on it is soon.

599
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,020
Trademark.

600
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,020
All right.

601
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,060
Anyhow let's get into our gaming weeks now because I just want to make sure I got that

602
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,380
announcement out VOG network dot com slash shop Dark Sakura.

603
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,300
How was your gaming week.

604
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,300
It was.

605
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,700
There is there's some pinball.

606
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,220
We moved a lot of stuff around.

607
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:46,900
I played Animal Crossing of course because I'm not going to not play Animal Crossing.

608
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:55,300
But but yeah I mean honestly I think all of my energy was on like Supernatural finale.

609
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:59,340
And so that was sort of my focus.

610
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:03,380
It's a shame there was never a video game you know.

611
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:10,900
Oh well I'm surprised there was no there was there was tabletop R.P. but you know like

612
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,500
card games there's Supernatural clue which I kind of want.

613
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,500
Oh that's good.

614
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:20,060
And Trivial Pursuits and Monopoly because they did freakin versions of everything from

615
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,060
Monopoly.

616
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:29,460
But but yeah not not really so much just a lot of the Animal Crossing and word and wordscapes.

617
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,460
That's my other jam.

618
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,460
All right.

619
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:38,020
If that's it for Dark Sakura we'll move to Loki and your gaming week.

620
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:41,420
I didn't play a whole lot this week because I've been just mainly working on my stuff.

621
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:48,620
I did try to play a little bit of Minecraft but the problem is that Mojang updated bedrock

622
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:56,540
this week to some new version that's was have some parity with the Java version and their

623
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,220
servers are having trouble.

624
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:02,260
Oh I guess it's not necessarily that update as well but they also added realms to the

625
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,060
PlayStation users.

626
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:08,260
So now that they can access that as well and servers.

627
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:14,620
And so that's causing all sorts of problems being able to connect to our realm and stuff.

628
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:18,860
So that kind of sucked because my kids wanted to play with me and I couldn't.

629
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:24,920
So I did play a little bit though and that was all right but couldn't play in my realm

630
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,920
and that's disappointing.

631
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,960
But I worked a lot on my game and that's still coming along.

632
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:35,180
I know I keep seeing your little updates on Twitter and I'm so I really want to see it.

633
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,180
I'm so excited.

634
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,180
It's going to be the best holiday present.

635
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,180
I really want to show it to you.

636
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,180
All right.

637
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,180
Well get finish it up.

638
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,180
All right.

639
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:47,000
My gaming week continued adventures on my Xbox Series X that I talked about last week.

640
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,080
I actually did a stream on my personal channel earlier this week.

641
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,840
Cheap plug over at Rob Roberts also here on Twitch.

642
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:58,960
The video on demand is still there and I don't lock my video on demand so you can go

643
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,960
watch it if you want.

644
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:04,980
But I did a pretty thorough playthrough of well not complete playthrough but I was explaining

645
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,740
and narrating my choices in No Man's Sky.

646
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:12,600
So I was playing that for a good probably two hours on my feed earlier this week on

647
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,660
Xbox Series X.

648
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:20,840
I got to say I tried to stream originally from the Xbox and I guess the one negative

649
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:26,360
I'm going to say about the Xbox right now is that trying to stream from it on Twitch

650
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,360
sucks.

651
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:32,960
I'm sorry it's not good compared to how it was on Sony because you have to do it through

652
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:40,240
the Twitch app and you have no way to test the audio and you have no way to test the

653
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,720
video without going live.

654
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,040
I'm a perfectionist and I hate that.

655
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:50,320
So I hit the button to go live to broadcast from my Xbox and my camera looked like shit

656
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,120
in the living room and I couldn't hear myself even though I had a headset plugged into

657
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,120
my controller.

658
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,280
So I was like alright this is a terrible idea.

659
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,240
Do you just hook the camera to the Xbox how does that work?

660
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,080
It will use any USB camera.

661
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:08,160
So it's that I guess that is a plus over PlayStation is that you can use any USB camera.

662
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:13,280
I actually used this same camera that we use for Orange Lounge Radio is on a little tripod

663
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,240
so I moved it into the living room and yeah but my light you guys know my living room

664
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,040
the lighting in there is terrible.

665
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,240
So it wasn't good on the stream.

666
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:27,960
So I did like two seconds of that I was like forget it I'm going to move the Xbox into

667
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:34,120
my office and honestly that was really easy because one thing I love about the Xbox it's

668
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,120
a box.

669
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:40,080
It's very it's a decently sized console but it's very easy to pick up and move.

670
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,080
There's no power brick or anything.

671
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,600
I already had an HDMI cable hooked up in my office.

672
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,280
I just had to unplug the Wii U from it.

673
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,880
Rest in peace.

674
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,240
But then I just I put the box plugged it in where the Wii U was put in the we use HDMI

675
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:00,800
cable and I was able to stream the Xbox in my office on my PC.

676
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,080
Very easy.

677
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,000
And so yeah that's that's how I'll do it in the future.

678
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Yeah.

679
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,880
S.G.O. 100 Matt says the alternative is to just put it into a capture card and do it

680
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,880
through OBS.

681
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,960
Yes that is what I did.

682
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,640
Yeah that's probably what I'm going to start doing because I wanted I've been wanting to

683
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:21,640
because I've been watching some people actually speed run the console Minecraft doing random

684
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,160
seeds and it looks like it's a pretty casual thing you can do.

685
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,800
So I kind of want to get into it because there's not a lot of competition on the console version

686
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,800
of it.

687
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,160
Whereas I normally play on the PC console version of it if you will.

688
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,800
But I can play on the console console version of it on my Xbox right here.

689
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,320
So makes sense.

690
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,320
Yeah.

691
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,920
So that made it really easy to stream.

692
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:48,440
So I'll do that again for sure because it's it's interesting because at least two people

693
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,200
one of them being Bobby Black Wolf has said you know after you kind of played that on

694
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:56,360
your stream it made me want to go check out all this stuff that I realized they'd added

695
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,360
to the game.

696
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,760
So I take that as a compliment.

697
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,760
Thank you.

698
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,760
Although Bobby found out the PlayStation 5 version of No Man's Sky has some issues right

699
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,560
now and it's all with the HDR.

700
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:15,680
The HDR effect is it's it's like turned up to 21 on a scale of 1 to 10 the HDR is 21

701
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,200
and so it looks really bad.

702
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,920
But if you turn the HDR off the game runs fluid fine.

703
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:29,240
I had I had no doubt that the game would run just as smoothly on PlayStation 5 as it does

704
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,560
on Xbox.

705
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:35,820
And to be fair the Microsoft version has some weird shit all of its own like the aliens

706
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:40,060
I mentioned lastly the aliens will sometimes hold things and that thing will move all over.

707
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:45,900
I have warped into a planet just to be dropped from six feet above.

708
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,620
Like I warped there's no ground.

709
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:54,180
So there's some weird bugs still but I'm sure Hello Games is aware and I know they're aware

710
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,780
of the HDR thing.

711
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:58,620
And so they'll they'll fix that all up in the coming weeks because they've been very

712
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,140
good at supporting their game.

713
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,440
So yeah No Man's Sky.

714
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:08,220
So on Xbox I played Ori and the Blind Forest not the new one will of the wisps because

715
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:12,480
in my head I'm like I can't play the new one until I beat the old one.

716
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,920
So I started the old one again and I always forget how the beginning of that video game

717
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:23,400
is like the beginning of the movie up like you're just it's it's a lot.

718
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,860
So just be emotionally ready that you're going to have some feels when you start playing

719
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,860
Ori and the Blind Forest.

720
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:32,020
Otherwise it's a beautiful game and this is the first time I've been able to play it

721
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,040
in 4K HDR.

722
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,040
It looks great.

723
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,040
Love it.

724
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,900
So there's that.

725
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:43,660
And yeah otherwise been continuing my adventures in Final Fantasy 14 of course and a little

726
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,660
bit of Hades too.

727
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,660
Just a little bit.

728
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,660
A little bit.

729
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,660
So that's my gaming week.

730
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,660
All right.

731
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:53,920
So with that I think we should get into some gaming news and see what's been happening

732
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,920
this week.

733
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,060
Loki, why don't you start us off with some gaming news.

734
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,060
Yes.

735
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:02,980
So I'm very excited that Cyberpunk is right around the corner.

736
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:09,300
They just put out a brand new gameplay trailer and it looks amazing.

737
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:15,780
So to kind of coincide with that they are recognizing that there's been a problem with

738
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:20,340
DMCA takedowns with copyright music on Twitch.

739
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:27,340
They've actually worked on creating a brand new mode for Cyberpunk that allows folks to

740
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:33,060
be able to disable certain copyrighted tracks basically saying if you're planning on live

741
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:37,580
streaming Cyberpunk or if you just want to make videos we want to introduce you to a

742
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:41,000
new mode that allow you to disable certain copyrighted tracks.

743
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,740
We know that for content creators licensed music can sometimes be problematic.

744
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:50,220
So with this new mode you'll be able to disable a small number of selected tracks which could

745
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:56,680
cause some issues replacing them with a different song helping to avoid any problems.

746
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,680
Thank you.

747
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,560
I know other games that do that but it is nice to see that they are recognizing that

748
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:06,160
in this day and age that it's probably a good thing to do.

749
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:11,640
So I'm looking forward to them trying that out when it does come out.

750
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:15,640
Yeah, I wonder if this is a new normal for games in a way.

751
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,780
It really should be.

752
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:20,860
We have seen it before, you're right, but obviously there's a lot of hype around this

753
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:24,400
game because the number of times it's been delayed and the fact that it's by the guys

754
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,700
who did The Witcher which is very well received.

755
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:34,240
So I'm glad they have this option in there and it makes me wonder if it's kind of setting

756
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:42,600
an example for other games to follow that maybe should consider putting in a DMCA proof

757
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,240
mode or whatever you want to call it in the game as well.

758
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,680
I don't know if they ever, I mean I would still be interested to see if it's gonna,

759
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,640
I mean I think they're doing their best guess on this right now with licensing because it's

760
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:58,960
all tricky with that type of stuff but hopefully that if it doesn't end up working out that

761
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,080
they can still patch out more stuff on it.

762
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:05,840
I just don't like, at least the effort is nice.

763
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,360
Yeah.

764
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,980
Speaking of like Twitch antics, I'm gonna kind of sidebar a little bit here because

765
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,160
Bobby was talking about this in depth on his show.

766
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,600
He even got a call on it.

767
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:19,920
Somehow it wasn't even on our list tonight but it's close to this story and it has to

768
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,120
do with the new Hyrule Warriors that came out, the Age of Calamity, which I know I have

769
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,840
a lot of friends on Twitch who have been streaming that and playing that.

770
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,360
Yeah, my son has it.

771
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,360
Oh really?

772
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,360
How's your son like it?

773
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,840
You didn't bring it up during your gaming week.

774
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,560
Well I guess it's your kid's gaming week but.

775
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,520
I'm not playing it yet.

776
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,520
He's very excited about it because he played through the demo like constantly, he played

777
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,160
a ton of the demo.

778
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,920
Thankfully what's kind of nice about it though is because he played the demo, it saved his

779
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:51,280
progress and he was able to continue just after the demo and plus it also gave him some

780
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,160
starter sword or something like that for playing the demo as like a bonus which is pretty cool

781
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,520
but he's really enjoying it.

782
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,480
Real quick, sorry, this is another great new trend in the games too.

783
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,720
The Dragon Quest XI Definitive Edition demo on Xbox, same thing.

784
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:10,040
If you play and it's like a 10 hour demo and the save file will transfer over to the full

785
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,960
game when it comes out so just on it.

786
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,080
I like that trend too.

787
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,160
Because he was worried that he'd have to restart his progress and I'm like well you know it's

788
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,720
a demo you know sometimes you have to do that but I asked him after he played it because

789
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,040
he said oh yeah I'm at Death Valley and I've already done all this stuff and he's talking

790
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,320
about it and I'm like oh so you didn't have to restart?

791
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:35,760
He's like no no no it let me continue from where I was and so yeah he's really enjoying

792
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,760
it.

793
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:42,760
He's like huge into the Breath of the Wild lore and everything now which is kind of crazy.

794
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:48,360
He plays a ton of Breath of the Wild and now he's been playing a ton of this so it's pretty

795
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,360
cool.

796
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:53,320
Boy I keep forgetting your kid is getting older and older and to the point where like

797
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:56,520
he's getting to be like a young man with his own taste.

798
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,160
Oh my god this is your youngest son wow.

799
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,760
He's getting older too.

800
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:07,680
Yeah my 10 year old son he's playing mostly Roblox still and a little bit of Among Us

801
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:15,440
but it's mostly my youngest son is playing the Hyrule Warriors and the Legend of Zelda

802
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,960
stuff he's really into Breath of the Wild.

803
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:25,680
So anyway the reason why I brought up Hyrule Warriors Tangent Train is because some folks

804
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,960
in Australia were streaming it right when the game came out in Australia and they ended

805
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,840
up getting DMCA'd by Nintendo because they were playing the game before release but it

806
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:42,680
wasn't before release in Australia it's just that Nintendo of America was America centric

807
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:48,560
and probably you know set the clock on their legal eagles to be midnight or 9pm pacific

808
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:53,800
whatever and Australia is what like 18 hours ahead or something so long story short these

809
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:59,040
guys in Australia got shut down for breaking DMCA when they when they really weren't doing

810
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,000
anything wrong.

811
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,040
It's kind of fucked up I mean but at the same time it it's a tough lesson in we are all

812
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,480
at video game companies mercies on the streaming thing right now.

813
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:16,040
It is and it's this is not new I mean there's been times where and this this is a little

814
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:20,320
bit more egregious though because there's been times where a copy will leak out and

815
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:25,520
then they will play it like several days before it comes out and then they'll DMCA them because

816
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:32,520
of that but this is released in your own region I mean that's that's a bit ridiculous.

817
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:38,640
Yeah I it's it's rough and I hope Nintendo would work with Twitch to restore these Australian

818
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,760
people who are really doing nothing wrong.

819
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:47,100
Was it Nintendo or Tecmo Koei because you know they're the ones that developed the game.

820
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:52,520
I believe all the stories were saying Nintendo but I didn't didn't Nintendo publish it even

821
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,520
if Tecmo Koei made it?

822
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,040
I think Nintendo still published it.

823
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:02,000
Yeah Bobby's confirming it was Nintendo that did it so so anyway you know but tough lesson

824
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,520
for our friends in Australia is that shouldn't even be a lesson there's no lesson to learn

825
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,320
you what you bought the game you're playing it on release well understand why they even

826
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:15,500
got struck down I get what you're saying Loki and you're right maybe that's not the best

827
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:20,300
word choice on my part but I still am going to err on the side of we are all on borrowed

828
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:25,860
time with this video game streaming thing anyway as it is so Nintendo is gracious enough

829
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:30,000
to let us you know stream the game and unfortunately they you know had the clock too early on the

830
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,080
Australia thing but Twitch is on American soil and Nintendo of America is on American

831
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:41,080
soil so by broadcasting through Twitch they kind of were held to the American rules and

832
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:46,120
it's something to think about I get and Loki it's not that I disagree with you it's one

833
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:51,860
of those like it sucks but it's the way it is and there ain't a lot we can do about it

834
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:56,240
they make it too difficult to broadcast their games then people aren't gonna broadcast their

835
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:00,960
games the broadcast other games I mean that's just kind of the way it is I mean they took

836
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:06,200
this hard stance before with like having everybody sign up for their Nintendo partner program

837
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:11,320
so that they can stream games or put stuff on YouTube so they could share in the revenue

838
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:15,400
I mean I was I'm sorry I had to wait it's scrolling along the bottom right now because

839
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,200
we have headlines that scroll throughout the show from various gaming websites someone's

840
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:24,200
already playing cyberpunk 2077 on Twitter that's a whole different thing that's obviously

841
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:30,240
someone has a review copy or there's they have I would assume it's a review copy this

842
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:35,180
early they wouldn't be shipping yet so they have a review copy that they're probably playing

843
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:40,600
and that's a big no-no and they will get caught I would assume act-def does want to point

844
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:44,540
out and it is always important if we get facts and stories have changed we need to report

845
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:50,080
those so act-def in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says they have been restored and

846
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:55,460
Bobby is saying reviewers don't have their copies yet you know because we're in a position

847
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:58,920
on Twitter and stuff and just having networked with enough people at e3 over the years and

848
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:03,980
stuff we we sometimes know when that stuff is out there and cyberpunk is not out there

849
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:09,260
yet but you know what is out there are the warehouses starting to store the disk because

850
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:14,340
you know it's a process to get the yes well I mean maybe I don't know just from the distribution

851
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:19,480
side it's usually more last minute but maybe these larger retailers are I would think it's

852
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:27,340
a bit early normally product doesn't arrive that much that early ah but they delayed the

853
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:32,100
game for a day one patch and they did it really late in the game so what do you want to bet

854
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:37,620
a lot of stuff was still moving for the old release date no I don't I don't buy it because

855
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:42,660
even if that was the case I mean that was still several weeks before it would launch

856
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:50,280
it's not to say that that hasn't happened I mean like for example there was I'm only

857
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:54,240
not pushing back because you've worked in distribution so I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm just

858
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:58,200
saying like if it were like an issue where like they have the recall something they would

859
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:02,560
recall it back it wouldn't be just sitting in a warehouse for months because they would

860
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:07,120
be tagged with the wrong release date anyways you'd see you know do not open until like

861
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:11,580
November 10th or something I don't remember the original release date thing is in November

862
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:17,860
I don't know whatever someone has it someone's playing it I'm sure they're not happy about

863
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:21,060
it but at least they're not striking their videos down as far as I'm aware they're more

864
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:26,380
like saying just be aware you know this is out there so well it is nice though it is

865
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:30,560
nice so that active mentioned in chat they have been restored so I'm glad they were able

866
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:37,100
to work it out you know the Nintendo and Australia and all that stuff but it it wasn't a great

867
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:40,660
thing that happened but maybe it's something for Nintendo to think about in the future

868
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:43,960
that maybe they should set that clock you know if the game releases what would be the

869
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,960
first country in the world to get video games New Zealand if that would or there's there's

870
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:55,480
an island the is Vanuatu or something but none of those none of those small islands

871
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:00,360
are technically game region releases they kind of usually I think a place like that

872
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,940
kind of shares with New Zealand and Australia so let's assume New Zealand is the first country

873
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:10,120
in the world that they get stuff then the clock has to be set to their time basically

874
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:17,120
so anyway all right uh Phoenix 7726 says I mean it's CD Projekt Red if it did get out

875
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:21,580
and it was ready to ship out they might not care much might have figured that it was inevitable

876
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:25,700
it would probably also depend on what was being shown my understanding is the person

877
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:30,120
who has Cyberpunk was showing the beginning of the game which CD Projekt Red's kind of

878
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:37,380
shown a million times already anyway if that person was out there streaming the ending

879
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:40,380
well my understanding is there's supposed to be a variety of endings so maybe it won't

880
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:45,300
be the most but I be careful when you start to stream stuff deep into the game especially

881
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:49,780
if there's big spoilers that's the stuff I would be very careful with I'm not up and

882
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:54,340
up on the story behind Cyberpunk so I don't know if there's like if there could be deaf

883
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:58,980
characters and stuff that could really spoil it for some people I don't know but I wouldn't

884
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,440
I'd be very careful in streaming any of that stuff because that's the stuff they're going

885
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:09,820
to want to keep a lid on for sure all right Bobby says apparently the prologue is six

886
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:14,720
hours long six hours before you get to the title card if you thought Persona or Kingdom

887
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:19,800
Hearts 2 had a long prologue how's that compared to Yakuza like a dragon which by the way I

888
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,480
watched some other people talk about that game and it has to be a little bit more interested

889
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:29,820
actually play because they say it is is very much like an RPG like a turn-based RPG it

890
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:37,340
just it's it is very slow to get started but man I've been playing that for several hours

891
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:44,100
and I'm still not past the tutorial section of the game wow all right well let's move

892
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:50,180
on I want to talk about another big game that's recent and that is Doom Eternal you know came

893
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:56,960
out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox one and you know it has it's now on game pass so if you want to

894
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,840
play it on your Series X you can do that it's on PC of course the platform that's missing thus

895
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:08,120
far is the Nintendo switch and you might remember the I want to say original doom but the original

896
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:14,480
doom reboot from a few years ago that did come out on Nintendo switch and it was received pretty

897
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:20,360
well so folks on Nintendo switch some of them were really looking forward to Doom Eternal well

898
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:24,700
I shouldn't say past tense so here's the thing it is still coming but there was a little bit of

899
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:30,700
confusion because apparently GameStop reached out to some folks who pre-ordered Doom Eternal

900
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:36,920
on switch and said the game is canceled so this caused people to go what oh is this because

901
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:43,040
Microsoft bought Bethesda so now they're canceling the switch release how could this happen well

902
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:49,180
here's what's happened so the Bethesda support account on Twitter chimed in we have not made

903
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:54,820
any announcements on doom eternal being canceled for switch keep an eye on our website and official

904
00:54:54,820 --> 00:55:00,140
Twitter channels for more information well here's the statement from Bethesda while doom eternal is

905
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:06,500
a hundred percent on track for an imminent digital only release on Nintendo switch the absence of a

906
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:12,140
physical release at retail resulted in canceled pre-orders affected customers will receive full

907
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:17,540
refunds and should contact their preferred retailer for more information so the physical

908
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:24,000
version of doom eternal was canceled but it will still release in digital form only which you know

909
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:30,140
I may be a problem if you're a collector if you're you know for a lot of people are buying digital

910
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:35,960
anyway so it's not really a problem what's to blame we don't know was the demand there we don't

911
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:40,720
know is that the pandemic and supply shortages and being able to make the game we don't know

912
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:45,900
the reasons we just know it's not going to be happening physically anymore um let me ask you

913
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:51,460
guys though if this was a game you were really interested in and they suddenly canned the

914
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:57,340
physical release in favor of a digital only one would this make you not want to buy it or would

915
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:01,980
you just kind of shrug your shoulders and be like hey all right well at least I'll still play the

916
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:08,420
game I mean on the switch probably not a big deal I get most of my games digitally anyways I except

917
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:14,600
last high rewards I did pick up physically because I have so many games installed to my memory card

918
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:22,120
that like I'm running out of space so I just figured I'd grab this one physically but you

919
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:28,320
know it's no big deal I don't really if at this point it doesn't matter yeah I think there's so

920
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:33,500
much that's digital only anyway it's not a huge deal like just a couple weeks ago or last week

921
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:37,160
actually we were talking about fuser Shane was on the show talking about how much he loved to

922
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:42,140
harmonics his new fuser and I remember when I was like oh that's like a download only thing right

923
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:47,140
so how much is it like 20 bucks he's like no it's $60 it's full price game I'm like what but that's

924
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:52,400
where some things are going now is that you know and to be fair if I were to buy it on Steam or a

925
00:56:52,400 --> 00:57:01,500
lot I'd be paying full price for it there too so it's kind of kind of interesting anyway one of the

926
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:07,140
thing I want to say though on the Bethesda and Xbox issue before we go to our next story is that

927
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:14,960
the folks at Microsoft have clarified this is coming from Tim Stewart who's the chief financial

928
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:21,280
officer over Xbox said quote what we'll do in the long run is we don't have intentions of just

929
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:28,240
pulling all of Bethesda content out of Sony or Nintendo or otherwise but what we want is but we

930
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:34,940
want is we want that content in the long run to be either first or better or best or you pick your

931
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:41,940
differentiated experience on our platforms we will want Bethesda content to show up the best as on

932
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:46,820
our platforms that's not a point about being exclusive that's not a point about we're being

933
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:52,300
adjusting timing content or roadmap but if you think something like game pass if it shows up

934
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:56,820
best in game pass that's what we want to see and we want to drive our game pass subscriber base

935
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,800
through that Bethesda pipeline so a couple interesting things about it no they're not

936
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:07,380
gonna pull out of Sony and switch but they do fully intend on making the best version on Xbox

937
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:13,040
that's for sure I mean as it makes sense of course that should be obvious to literally anybody the

938
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:19,440
other interesting thing about that comment nowhere in it did Tim Stewart the chief financial officer

939
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:30,340
say the word Xbox the word he said was game pass hmm just an interesting observation there's been a

940
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:35,820
lot of talk about what is Microsoft's plan in this whole thing does Microsoft care about how many

941
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:42,340
Xboxes they sell because that answer says that's not what they're looking at mr. chief financial

942
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:49,720
officer just don't make money off consoles it's just it's just an interesting confirmation of

943
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:55,000
something I think we all I mean a backhanded confirmation fine it's not really a confirmation

944
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:02,000
but it is for me of something we've all been kind of speculating about anyway as to what is Microsoft

945
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:08,320
really in this to do right now that was the most interesting part of the quote for me the rest of

946
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:17,540
it was obvious anyway Zen monkey 11 in our chat says buying Skyrim digital on ps4 before it's

947
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:22,980
pulled from PlayStation 4 store I actually don't think that'll happen Zen monkey what what is

948
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:29,620
Microsoft have to gain from that especially a game as old and dusty at this point as Skyrim I'm

949
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:33,760
making it sound terrible it's really not I just played Skyrim last week okay it's still gorgeous

950
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:39,260
all these years later Alan is playing it again right now with all the new mods so Skyrim is in

951
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:45,220
some ways a timeless game what does Microsoft have to gain pulling it from PlayStation when so many

952
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:51,860
people already have that game on PlayStation like I just would Don Mattrick have pulled it from

953
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:58,220
PlayStation probably is Phil Spencer gonna do it nah and I think a lot of these other comments we've

954
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:04,800
seen coming from Microsoft they they're not they're not thinking about we've got to have

955
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:14,540
Xbox be the only platform it's game pass so when Sony puts out that competitor to game pass we'll

956
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:18,760
talk about that later in the show when Sony inevitably puts out that competitor game pass

957
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:23,840
beyond what they're already doing a PlayStation Plus that my friend is where you will never see

958
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:31,700
Skyrim you will never see doom you will never see starfield or any Bethesda product on PlayStation

959
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:37,860
game pass Sony is gonna have to get in bed with some other companies I mean but granted they've

960
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:42,140
got a pretty strong first party lineup as it is you can't you know I think they do pretty well

961
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:49,580
with what they got but Sony will have to get in bed with other third parties to get on their game

962
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:58,040
pass Phoenix 7726 says on one hand Microsoft is not EA so Bethesda will probably not die on the

963
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:03,120
other hand consolidation ain't good in this market I think it's really early to be thinking

964
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:07,600
about consolidation and those types of things too especially in this nature of this pandemic world

965
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:13,040
we're living in and like like a lot of companies are having a hard time putting out games right

966
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:21,700
now fuck look at Microsoft themselves halo got halo should in any other year like needed to be

967
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:40,100
out now but it got delayed to 2021 it's it's different now we have to be thinking of this

968
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:45,280
industry different now than we were thinking about it in 2012 or whenever the last round of

969
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:50,560
consoles will I can't I can't get my ears fucking straight anyway nothing about me straight I can't

970
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:56,060
get the years together anymore but I think it was 2012 but the way we're approaching things

971
01:01:56,060 --> 01:02:04,320
it's different now it is so different all right anyway let's move on dark Sakura but then but but

972
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:11,940
then there's Nintendo right so and this is this is something that's already happened a couple of

973
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:22,120
days ago as of now but on the 19th there was the update for Animal Crossing new horizons we got

974
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:31,260
some maple leaves that are floating down that you can catch like getting the cherry blossoms and we

975
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:39,660
had all the holiday events and some toys and new stuff that you can get crafting and you also had

976
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:49,140
the introduction of turkey day which is the 26th and toy day on December 24th with that creepy ass

977
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:57,060
reindeer jingle with his creepy ass eyes and so turkey day is fun you have to collect ingredients

978
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:03,380
to make dishes so everyone can have turkey day where they you know apparently eat his kindred

979
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:12,980
and then of course toy day is you know you you'll get all the snow and decorated trees and ornaments

980
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:22,220
and crafting and stuff like that they have also put in new hairstyles and reactions which I have

981
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:27,300
yet to redeem I probably should do that but the thing that's really good about the hairstyles is

982
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:38,180
that it's bringing in more hairstyles that are I'd say typically associated with with the black

983
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:43,620
community so there's like you know puffs and cornrows and and natural hair and everything

984
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:50,900
which I think is wonderful because it's representation there's also a home storage limit

985
01:03:50,940 --> 01:04:01,420
upgrade so basically if you have paid off your final loan in full then you can get your your

986
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:09,020
storage expanded to 2,400 slots which I needed I had a very full storage Sia Tabiri in our chat

987
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:14,780
room is clearly more excited about this than anything else saying in all caps more home storage

988
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:20,300
I no longer need to sell something every time I see a cute thing at the Able Sisters that pretty

989
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:27,380
much I've been just trying to keep like the the non-orderable items in my inventory but yeah I

990
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:34,980
don't keep many many pants I have because I mean basically my character dresses like I do it's Dean

991
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:43,660
flannel and you know t-shirts and shit so but anyway you can also now visit random islands in

992
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:50,060
your dreams so instead of having to have a dream address you can just go wherever there is a

993
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:57,460
collaboration with Animal Crossing pocket camp you can get a pocket camp smartphone you can and

994
01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:07,180
this is the big thing for this one is that you can do data transfers so if it allows you to you

995
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:13,140
to transfer your resident data to another system including your name appearance equipment along

996
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:18,780
with your inventory your storage and your home there's a whole separate transfer feature that

997
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:26,620
will let you do the save data and the island itself in the residence to another system but

998
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:32,660
no they couldn't change the fact that if I don't want my youngest son to be in charge of my island

999
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:41,740
I can't change who is actually in charge of my island feedback but anyway there's also more new

1000
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:47,740
seasonal items that are gonna start on December 1st at nook stop and different festive items to

1001
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:56,060
decorate between the 26th and 31st of December so fun stuff I've been enjoying it when I have

1002
01:05:56,060 --> 01:06:02,540
actually had energy to play getting lots and lots of leaves I think I've already made half of the

1003
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:08,380
fall crafting already it's been pretty cool very cute Jamie I have something to confess I don't

1004
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:13,060
say it in a while I haven't played in a while I don't think I've touched my island since Labor

1005
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:21,300
Day does ketchup hate me now she's probably crying and things that you haven't come to see here but

1006
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:31,660
you can repair your relationship with ketchup actually do me a favor when you play let me come

1007
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:40,020
over and catch a roach oh I think you can catch a roach no shoot only you can do it crap I don't

1008
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:43,020
know if they actually do that in the game because I didn't see anything in the inventory but remember

1009
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:46,620
the old game if you didn't play for a while you could go into your house and catch bugs

1010
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:50,980
interesting but I don't think you can do that because you can't actually use the bug net inside

1011
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:58,100
of the building now yeah yeah huh yeah I don't think you can all right so no no roach catching

1012
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:06,380
for you all right let's move on to our next story Loki so this is pretty cool so apparently

1013
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:13,980
Iowa interactive they have revealed that they're beginning work on a brand new project project 007

1014
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:22,500
of course IO interactive best known for the hitman series I mean that that could only be good so

1015
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:30,540
apparently they are you know creating an original bond game they said it's an monumental undertaking

1016
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:37,180
and they believe that IO interactive working closely with their partners at UN and MGM are

1017
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:44,220
gonna be able to deliver an amazing game so that's all we know with you know that right now but I

1018
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:54,260
mean it sounds like a good combination yeah I was thinking recently too I think it was because of

1019
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:59,180
Sean Connery's passing I was kind of thinking like oh it's been a while since we've had like a real

1020
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:04,420
like kick-butt James Bond game I know they you know obviously GoldenEye is gonna be that standard

1021
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:10,060
that every other game I reloaded in yeah unfortunately lightning didn't strike twice there

1022
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:15,020
but didn't they I haven't didn't yay or some other company made a couple games I thought

1023
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:18,980
wouldn't there like a I don't even think it was Skyfall but I feel like there was like a game

1024
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:27,940
around that time that was like a separate like story all to its own they're like a unique story

1025
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:34,500
I thought I don't I could be wrong I might be confusing it with that old get older game on

1026
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:46,500
PlayStation 2 but um well they have like there was let's see I'm trying to think I know they

1027
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:51,380
have that legends game they have like kind of a whole bunch of different oh maybe that's what

1028
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:56,660
was thinking on there yeah yeah yeah I don't know I don't think that was like necessarily a you know

1029
01:08:56,660 --> 01:09:04,820
unique thing Bloodstone but I don't know if that I don't think that's based on the movie

1030
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:12,580
no that's not a movie title so huh well anyway I I think it'll be interesting to see the hitman

1031
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:19,300
team and what they do a James Bond it'll be it'll be interesting Zen Monkey 11 in chat says

1032
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:27,660
Goldeneye Source is the best to date so all right yeah right I mean the bad things more of a fan

1033
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:34,100
project that's certainly not Activision's Goldeneye Reloaded which is not of that caliber

1034
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:39,660
or quality yes I feel like we just had a story on Goldeneye Source a couple weeks ago so all right

1035
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:46,300
well let's move on and talk about maybe this James Bond game will be so good it gets nominated at the

1036
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:51,620
game awards in a couple years we did get the award list or excuse me the nominee list for the game

1037
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:57,460
awards 2020 which obviously is going to be a bit of a virtual event they are going to be using

1038
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:04,100
three sound stages in Los Angeles London and Tokyo especially since people still can't travel right

1039
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:09,380
now makes a lot of sense you can't get all those Japanese developers to LA so they're gonna have to

1040
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:13,340
do something in Tokyo but of course obviously you know they're gonna still be taking COVID

1041
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:17,460
precautions so I don't know how they're gonna do it watching some of these other award shows that

1042
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:20,940
have taken place have been kind of interesting they are seeing it's only gonna be minimal

1043
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:27,580
attendees mainly production crew and presenters so no no like audience obviously I mean we we

1044
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:33,420
know that's not gonna happen but Jeff Keeley has talked about how it is gonna allow additional

1045
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:39,040
presentation events similar to past shows but it's also exploring taking the game awards to

1046
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:45,960
different venues in the future anyway as it was previously there's gonna be 45 different platforms

1047
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:50,240
you can watch the game awards on so they're still trying to keep up the number of viewers for this

1048
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:58,080
and we have the nominees so obviously I could read every category but there's a lot if you want to

1049
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:02,880
check them out and you want to vote on the winners you can do that over on the official game awards

1050
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:12,240
website but by the way viewer votes only count for 10% of the total vote 90% is the jury which

1051
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:17,360
is you know a lot of industry people so food for thought your vote doesn't matter that much all

1052
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:23,400
right moving on to game of the year nominees this is the one everybody talks about so the nominees

1053
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:31,080
for game of the year are but animal crossing new horizons an entry that I think is surprising and

1054
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:36,680
non-surprising being that it's 2020 and this is a game you know we've talked about it at length on

1055
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:42,320
this show thanks dark soccer but all of us really have been obsessed with animal crossing is as a

1056
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:47,400
way to deal with the pandemic so not surprised to see it here in the list for game of the year

1057
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:53,640
there's always one Nintendo game in there doom eternal is also nominated for game of the year

1058
01:11:53,640 --> 01:12:00,240
which we brought up earlier the Final Fantasy 7 remake is nominated for game of the year ghosts

1059
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:08,120
of Tsushima is nominated for game of the year Hades is up for game of the year and the last of

1060
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:15,840
us part two is the final nominee for game of the year so some games that are not on the list cyber

1061
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:21,640
punk 2077 but that's because they delayed it past the eligibility timeframe we talked about that

1062
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:25,880
during the last delay now that it comes out in December it missed the delay window for this so

1063
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:31,040
that's why cyberpunk is not nominated some other games that didn't get nominated for game of the

1064
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:35,440
year Ori and the will of the Wisps got nominated in some other categories but some folks were

1065
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:41,160
thinking it was a shoe-in for game of the year nominee half-life Alex despite everything it did

1066
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:45,400
for VR did get some other awards and some technical categories like best game direction best audio

1067
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:52,360
design was not nominated for game of the year some other categories that I do think are interesting

1068
01:12:53,200 --> 01:13:01,680
best mobile game among us is nominated among us came out in 2018 so it's interesting that it's

1069
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:06,640
there it's kind of like the Grammys your best new artist the year people finally have heard of you

1070
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:13,560
I guess let's see what else what was the other one I wanted to say the best ongoing game was

1071
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:19,520
an interesting one as well no man's sky was I know yeah no man's sky is in that category which

1072
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:24,800
you know I love that but it's got some tough competition apex legends I mean they've they've

1073
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:30,240
gotten fortnight kind of in a similar vein destiny 2 is in that category and Call of Duty Warzone

1074
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:36,760
also in that category so interesting interesting Bobby Black Wolf is wondering if among us released

1075
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:45,040
for mobile this year that's a good question you might be right on that front that could be some

1076
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:50,480
folks in chat putting their opinion out there act def says who do I think deserves to win ghosts

1077
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:55,720
of Tsushima who do I think is going to win The Last of Us part 2 what game is gonna be pretty

1078
01:13:55,720 --> 01:14:03,240
cool if it won Animal Crossing for me I've only played half the games so it's not really fair for

1079
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:11,040
me to like put my too much in this there is a big part of me that's rooting for Hades just the fact

1080
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:17,040
that it is that little indie game that could in this year I have to admit like me personally

1081
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:20,760
that's the one I want to see win based on everything I've heard around the internet

1082
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:23,960
and buzz and stuff like that though I actually think ghosts of Tsushima has a really good shot

1083
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:30,640
I kind I kind of think similar to how um Sekiro die or excuse me shadows die twice won last year

1084
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:37,560
I kind of feel like ghosts of Tsushima is yes I know there's The Last of Us part 2 that's gonna

1085
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:42,640
be tough but I don't know there's there was some tough competition last year too I just there's

1086
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:46,560
something about the ghost of Tsushima that I think is gonna gonna be the tough one to beat so we'll

1087
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:52,520
see any thoughts early on on this list I mean I know you guys are like me and probably haven't

1088
01:14:52,520 --> 01:15:02,000
played them all but haven't played most of them I mean they're all good choices yeah I don't see

1089
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,920
a problem with any of those I know some people some people don't like Last of Us to being in

1090
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:19,760
there but yeah well some people are wrong so Jamie I don't even think I have to ask which

1091
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:25,400
one in that group you're rooting for but as much as you're an Animal Crossing fan I know you got

1092
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:29,200
to be smiling that something like Hades got in there too it's always nice to see the indie folks

1093
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:42,400
yes yes you do yes yeah I'm really happy I actually really enjoy the art style in it so so

1094
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:52,160
yeah I hope so I mean I'd really love to see Last of Us to you know very cool all right well we'll

1095
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:58,800
see the game awards themselves are taking place on December the 10th so you don't have that long

1096
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:02,840
to wait that's the interesting thing about the game awards I feel like the nominees come out and

1097
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:06,640
then it's like two weeks later is the award show like it's a very fast turnaround feel like it's

1098
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:11,960
fast faster than the Oscars you want to talk about fast turnaround like there already was

1099
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:21,120
that they're talking about doing a g4 special like what in a couple days yeah well it's already been

1100
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:26,520
taped because one of my Twitter people made it no secret that they're in it and it's not somebody

1101
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:33,040
that was involved in the old g4 so you know it's a they've apparently reached out to some big

1102
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:38,840
streamers and folks like that which is not terribly surprising something Bobby picked up on which I

1103
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:43,680
neglected when I first saw I neglected to notice it when I first saw it because I have to admit I

1104
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:50,160
don't I don't idolize g4 television the way some of you do like I just I'm just putting it out

1105
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:59,400
there like why focus on this one thing when there is so much other stuff out there in the media

1106
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:06,520
world well okay and that's what I was gonna say is that Bobby had pointed out that like pretty

1107
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:18,400
much all the pre tech TV stuff like none of it is represented none of it so it's uh it's this

1108
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:25,600
is definitely memories of a certain era of g4 yeah Bobby Black Wolf says I don't idolize g4 I

1109
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:29,440
just worked with them for two years that that wasn't a call-out for any specific person or

1110
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:35,080
anything and yes I of course you have a long history I mean in a way we kind of do too right

1111
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:40,240
because of you know the fact that we were affiliated with all games for those years so

1112
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:49,480
but I just feel like now in the year 2020 like g4 televisions coming up to a very full Thanksgiving

1113
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:57,280
table and I feel like some people are willing to to just do anything to be a part of the new

1114
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:06,920
g4 TV and I'm just kind of like okay but like there's other like I I don't think g4 TV is the

1115
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:16,880
top of the mountain in media the way that maybe it was back in the day when you know it was first

1116
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:22,360
on TV I think that's more my kind of point there is that g4 is coming to a very crowded space now

1117
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:30,880
and and trying to milk the nostalgia and all that stuff and yeah anyway so Bobby Black Wolf says g4

1118
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:36,520
began with attack of the show and x-play according to the reunion Tiger class says it's g4 in name

1119
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:46,240
only not the g4 you remember so it good luck you know I I won't be watching I've got other things

1120
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:56,480
to do okay but but will cheaters and cops be at the table too moving on all right we were talking

1121
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:01,240
about a fast turnaround on the game awards let's talk about things that are a slow turnaround

1122
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:11,880
Bioware releases right Jamie yeah lady insanity on Twitter put out a link to her blog and she does

1123
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:20,200

1124
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:29,200
it on her blog so just to give some highlights of this I'll just start off with with this month

1125
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:37,240

1127
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:50,200
stuff about cancelled games and behind-the-scenes stuff and concept art you know and this was of

1128
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:56,120
course after n7 day happened where they announced the Mass Effect Legendary Edition so on December

1129
01:19:56,120 --> 01:20:04,280

1130
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:10,600
December 10th is the Game Awards and there's a rumor that they may be doing another trailer for

1131
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:20,280
the next Dragon Age and then Star Wars the Old Republic Echoes of Oblivion they will have new

1132
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:28,520
content called Spirit of Vengeance and then going into 2021 a little bit more about the Art of Mass

1133
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:35,080

1136
01:20:53,400 --> 01:21:01,440
Wow and they're talking about anthem again I don't care about anthem just no it says anthem

1137
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:08,200
has been an active redevelopment no I do need to try that now that it's on the EA play game

1138
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:14,680
pass thing so it's like okay no no harm no foul no money needed to spend on it I'm curious and

1139
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:24,280
of course also the last thing on there is again for 2022 to be determined is next Mass Effect so

1140
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:31,720
we'll see no time soon on that I'm sure yeah oh no we'll still be we'll still be doing all our will

1141
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:37,880
be like what 40 we'll have hit episode thousand by the time that game's out I'm sure episode

1142
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:42,840
thousand that should be a party uh yeah I it really should be the pandemic should be over

1143
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:48,440
by then because we're still looking to get to episode 1000 that's we're on 844 tonight that's

1144
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:53,960
still gonna be a good at least three years out till we get to a thousand we need to do this

1145
01:21:54,680 --> 01:22:03,640
yeah are you guys committed um sure but it's a it's a I don't want to take on more than I can

1146
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:10,120
chew just I think getting you're already doing it getting to a thousand episodes is gonna be

1147
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:14,360
the show oh I thought you meant making it a big event I'm sorry I thought you meant make it okay

1148
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:20,760
I misinterpret yes make it make it to a thousand and then we like okay we're done count my lucky

1149
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:25,960
stars nothing happens to me of course I want us to be back in the same studio this is I mean

1150
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:32,280
I'm glad this works but I miss the magic of all of us being in the same room it's not the same

1151
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:40,440
to me so I'm glad we can still be here but yeah but you know there is an advantage what's that I

1152
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:48,840
can sit at my desk and eat spaghetti there's a your throne has gone unsad in except by mr smoosh

1153
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:57,560
for like nine months now well better dust it off yeah right oh and hey hey um I just took another

1154
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:03,240
covid test if it's clean who knows who knows well let's let's get past this big spike that's

1155
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:09,160
happening right now but yeah um let's see bobby blackwolf in chat says pull a travis donovan

1156
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:15,640
make it to episode 999 and then rebrand and start at episode one yeah uh zen monkey says if you

1157
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:22,200
if you make the show seven days a week you get two thousand easy yeah well I mean that's how like uh

1158
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:25,720
you know gamertag radio they hit a thousand episodes because I remember talking about that

1159
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:30,440
and that's they've done multiple episodes a week this is in no way knocking this incredible

1160
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:36,200
achievement that they have it's just their show is different as different podcasts are so they got to

1161
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:42,760
a thousand episodes by you know doing multiple episodes in a week which cool uh you know they

1162
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:47,880
probably also have been going longer than supernatural has been on tv which is no small

1163
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:53,960
feat you know what I mean so uh yeah any show that makes it to a thousand episodes is uh got

1164
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:58,120
my respect but yeah when we're going when we're taking it a week at a time it's gonna take a

1165
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:04,280
little while and not and to be fair we take off about six shows a year which is way better than

1166
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:13,800
any show on tv um but you know holidays things happen travel dragon con or whatever con uh we

1167
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:22,120
take off about six shows a year so I'm gonna think about all right uh what when we're done

1168
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:29,800
we salt and burn the show we give it a viking funeral uh I was saying a hunter's funeral

1169
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:34,920
uh bobby blackwolf and chat says you're gonna need to give us lots of bits and buy lots of

1170
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:40,680
merch to do a vegas party oh who said it was gonna be in vegas you know where we're gonna

1171
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:50,040
have you know where olr con's gonna be roseville golf land in the party room no all right that's

1172
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:58,120
i'm kind of down we get the banquet room at brookfield's i'm down for that too honestly

1173
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:03,800
get the banquet room at brookfield's yeah let's do it i love it hey they have my favorite soup

1174
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:11,640
anyway uh let's see uh phoenix says i wonder if there's a podcast up to 10 000 episodes

1175
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:17,480
yet um i'm sure somewhere there's there's daily shows out there right and not not necessarily

1176
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:23,000
about video games but what's uh leo leport and his stuff at aren't they every day

1177
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:28,440
he has so many different series like i used to follow a lot of that stuff but like he's got like

1178
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:35,400
multiple shows a day coming out like it's just insane that's what happened with pod save america

1179
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:40,840
i used to listen when it was like you know this little little new podcast that you know and now

1180
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:47,080
it's like a fucking media empire so it's hard to follow they used to have their like daily show

1181
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:53,160
they have a few daily shows and they have like an android show and an apple show and a windows show

1182
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:59,160
and it's like there's just so many and this is okay sorry tangent but y'all brought it on

1183
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:03,560
this is what this is why i can't get through a show like pod save america or any of that stuff

1184
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:08,600
anymore oh my god i can't believe i named names i'm sorry guys i i i really respect everything

1185
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:14,120
that's goes into a podcast and stuff but here's the thing about a lot of other networks that

1186
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:21,320
really bother me you tune in to listen to the show and get your talk right and the entire intro of

1187
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:27,160
the show is here's everything that's going on this week on all of the other shows you need to be

1188
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:33,080
checking out for like to and then let's go to an ad about squarespace or whatever the ad of the

1189
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:37,880
week thing is let's talk about me undies or whatever the fuck is sponsoring a podcast this

1190
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:43,960
week right and then it's like by the time you actually get into the content that you tuned in

1191
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:50,120
for you're like 15 minutes into the show and i'm saying that as somebody who plays a very active

1192
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:54,840
role here at vog network i'm happy to tell you about all the new shows that come on board and

1193
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:59,480
all that stuff but i am not going to spend 10 minutes at the top of every show going here's

1194
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:10,440
why you should listen to something else it's just anyway am i alone in that okay clearly yes all

1195
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:17,720
right uh zen monkey says wow podcast networks do that oh sorry sorry i like how they do the ads

1196
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:25,000
for um like uh uh stuff you missed in history and stuff mom never told you the the ones that that

1197
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:30,200
are there through i heart radio um even though it's corporate and you know they've got to have

1198
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:37,480
the sponsors i think that they space out their sponsor in digestible little chunks that are

1199
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:42,600
maybe no more than a minute a minute and a half and it doesn't really interrupt what you're

1200
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:48,680
listening to that much yeah like you know um you sure commercial breaks like you're used to like

1201
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:52,440
when you're when your things are that way yeah whatever like and honestly when i was listening

1202
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:57,720
to the rue paul and michelle podcast which where the hell did that go they just they they stopped

1203
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:02,920
right around the time that rue deleted twitter i don't know but anyway um and look i realize that

1204
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:10,280
rue has a lot of issues twitter uh it might be back now but i at one point yeah rue like i think

1205
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:15,880
rue was getting cancelled for something i don't know was it the fracking i don't know i something

1206
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:21,720
was going on bruce twitter is up oh okay well at some point it was down and that show just vanished

1207
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:26,680
but anyway like the way they did ads on that show almost became a parody like it was great

1208
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:33,240
anyway like i there's nothing i love more than listening to trixie impersonate rue doing an ad

1209
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:40,600
spot that's okay that actually sounds really funny but i mean but it is kind of a sad reality um for

1210
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:48,680
like for for us we're able to swing a lot of what we do you know yeah but but for some people this

1211
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:54,920
is exactly how they are able to keep doing what they do is by by sponsored funding i'm not i i

1212
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:59,560
have no problem with sponsorships and commercials and things like that it's it's when it's over

1213
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:03,880
done and it's the complete beginning of the show you know what i mean that's where it's an issue

1214
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:09,720
i don't want it well it's like i mean even like for example for my for my blog i i do have like

1215
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:15,480
a couple little revenue things but they go at the very end of my article and i think that that's

1216
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:21,640
kind of how the sponsorship should be is that it should be in an innocuous place yeah all right

1217
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:31,240
let's agree let's move on uh next story is uh loki's all right so uh we talked about how some

1218
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:38,120
games are getting different enhancements as they move to these new generation of consoles so of

1219
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:43,720
course uh with that we see some of these older games that were from the xbox one and playstation

1220
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:52,520
4 also getting enhancements as well um however there are seeming to be more coming to the xbox

1221
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:59,880
um series x and s because of the nature of how they're able to patch updates for their

1222
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:04,440
backwards compatibility so for example later this year we're going to be getting an update

1223
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:10,680
for rocket league that's going to allow it to run in 120 fps on the xbox series x and s

1224
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:17,720
but they are not able to do that on the playstation 5 without building a full native port

1225
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:25,640
of the game um because of the way like i said that that works on the playstation 5 versus

1226
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:33,160
the xbox uh series of consoles also um along with that there's gonna be some updates coming

1227
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:40,040
to star wars squadrons as well they're gonna allow the game to run at 1440p at 120 fps on the series

1228
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:51,000
s and it looks like at 4k at 120 fps as well in the series x which would be incredible um

1229
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:57,800
and then of course call of duty war zone is also going to be gaining 120 fps update on consoles as

1230
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:05,880
well and um they're saying that also that there's it may end up being around 100 with some of the

1231
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:11,720
slowdowns in there but um still need to see that some updates are coming but it kind of sucks i

1232
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:18,120
guess with the differences in architecture that it is limiting sometimes with how they're able

1233
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:22,440
to implement that and they can't necessarily do it equally across the board with two different

1234
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:32,520
uh manufacturers of consoles yeah it's um it's i'm hearing it's it's a little more because bobby

1235
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:37,800
was talking about this on his show see a natural network plug a little bit about the um no man's

1236
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:43,240
sky on playstation 5 and how it seems to be a bit of a a chore to get the playstation 5 version on

1237
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:49,560
there from the playstation 4 disc where you have to kind of like install the the playstation 4

1238
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:54,520
version and then once that's there you can kind of choose to download the playstation 5 version

1239
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:58,760
which will require the disc to be in your console to play it which makes it i mean i'm not mad about

1240
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:02,440
that yeah that makes sense but it's weird that you have to like go through the playstation 4

1241
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:08,680
version to get the playstation 5 version whereas i'm gonna be honest my microsoft experience was

1242
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:14,120
okay no man skies in game pass download it to my xbox series series x it's obviously getting the

1243
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:19,400
new version of the game whatever launch the game and oh it synced my slave file save file to the

1244
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:25,160
crowd to the cloud so if i wanted to play my old save which i'd played for like 15 minutes on xbox

1245
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:29,320
one i could have brought that in but i just started a new one but i thought it was it was

1246
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:34,440
just right there ready to go yeah it seems like they're kind of treatment i mean obviously these

1247
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:39,880
consoles are more like pcs every day but they're treating it more like a pc where if i own a game

1248
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:47,160
on steam and i get a new pc i can download it but i can play it in you know with better resolution

1249
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:52,200
with more graphic enhancements added to it at a higher frame rate and that's kind of how they're

1250
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:57,240
treating it with that they're not making it so that i have to create a brand new version of the

1251
01:32:57,240 --> 01:33:03,160
game for this pc and a brand new version of the game for this pc and i think that's a good

1252
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:08,280
approach that they took and hopefully sony will be a little bit more i i don't know if sony can

1253
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:13,160
necessarily redesign their whole platform they probably can at this point but maybe adding some

1254
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:18,840
more resolutions available because i know we were talking about it last week or so that they don't

1255
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:25,080
have 1440p right now at launch they have to patch that in you know maybe adding some of those um

1256
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:31,560
as you know different resolutions that they can use to hit some of these higher frame rates like

1257
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:35,400
for example going back to rocket league they're saying that they have a performance mode on the

1258
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:44,680
series x that plays at 2688 by 1512 resolution at 120 fps um but the playstation 5 version will

1259
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:49,800
be limited 4k at 60 fps because i don't think they can do those in between resolutions right

1260
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:58,120
now it has to either upscale to you know 4k or downscale to 1080 so it's it's just limited right

1261
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:02,760
now by what's available but i don't know they can necessarily redesign everything that's not to say

1262
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:07,480
that xbox is going to be the more powerful console because i know that like some games run a little

1263
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:13,720
bit better on playstation 5 right now it just it depends on how the developer develops the games

1264
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:17,960
for these consoles but it sounds like that on the xbox side of the house it's a little bit more

1265
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:25,720
flexible with some of the enhancements they can do all right um yeah i think um you know some

1266
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:29,160
everybody i shouldn't say everybody but there's a lot of people out there that always want to start

1267
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:34,360
a war with microsoft versus sony but i think the time has come to kind of say you know what this

1268
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:39,640
time around it's a very similar sort of thing the the differences between the two consoles i don't

1269
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:43,640
and some people strongly disagree with this because of the the dual sense experience you

1270
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:48,680
know on the playstation 5 in this but you know as far as like what's the more powerful system

1271
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:53,880
like they're getting very close and a lot of these things are very nuanced you know that are

1272
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:57,720
the actual differences between the two i don't know i just you know when i look at something

1273
01:34:57,720 --> 01:35:03,000
like no man's sky and how it plays on xbox series x how it plays on playstation 5 outside of the hdr

1274
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:11,160
bug which they will fix it's looks pretty similar you know so yeah all right let's move on

1275
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:17,880
phoenix 77 26 says it's pc the more powerful system and you know what for some people that's

1276
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:23,400
always going to be the way it is all right let's talk about that and then there's nintendo uh

1277
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:27,640
super mario 3d all stars remember that because that's still a big thing they're going to be

1278
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:33,000
pushing through the holidays and then never again uh super mario 3d all stars just got

1279
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:38,360
gamecube controller support that's actually pretty cool uh since after all it is you know emulating

1280
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:42,760
uh super mario sunshine in a way now you can actually hook up a gamecube controller and play

1281
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:47,240
super mario sunshine the way it was meant to be played you know speaking of analog trigger or

1282
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:51,320
speaking of you know the triggers that you know have the different pressures that was the thing

1283
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:56,440
on the gamecube controller that is lost with the switch so that's kind of neat that that is back

1284
01:35:56,440 --> 01:36:02,520
now um so yeah if you can find a gamecube controller adapter that is uh and a gamecube

1285
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:06,520
controller but they're still around you know obviously the smash community really loves them

1286
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:11,160
um and you can you can find them have some usb ones though too that you can get that are not

1287
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:15,960
necessarily i think they're like uh will the switch recognize them yeah they sell them at

1288
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:20,840
the store you know um i think they're like that power a brand or something like that like they

1289
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:27,080
have like all the third-party companies and make those cheaper controllers um i don't know if i i

1290
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:32,040
would assume it has analog on it as well but i mean maybe that's an option if you can't find

1291
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:40,440
the expensive ones now um the other big update with uh the mario 3d collection that will get

1292
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:45,080
a lot of people excited is that you can now invert the camera controls with all three titles

1293
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:50,520
yay because some people don't you know you get used to using the joysticks a certain way and then

1294
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:56,200
it's inverted suddenly and it gets really irritating so uh they also give a vague other

1295
01:36:56,200 --> 01:37:00,520
general fixes have been applied to improve overall gameplay across all three titles

1296
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:10,120
no idea what that means but okay so hero brain's been removed all right let's go to a simpler time

1297
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:15,560
and uh take a trip to the gaming vault as we look oh my gosh i ran the wrong footage sorry

1298
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:20,840
uh we're gonna go to a simple time and look at the classic game of the week which i might have

1299
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:26,360
just spoiled but maybe not enough uh once a week dark soccer dives into the gaming vault and finds

1300
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:31,880
a game that she thinks hey you guys should be checking this game out and uh once a month though

1301
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:36,760
she decides to go into the pinball vault and choose a classic pinball that y'all should be

1302
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:41,080
checking out and i'm sure you guys have no idea what's coming based on that two second oops i

1303
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:44,760
just did but dark soccer why don't you surprise us all with the classic pinball of the month

1304
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:52,760
it's medieval madness so um medieval madness was put out by williams um it was released in june

1305
01:37:52,760 --> 01:38:03,720
1997 designed by brian eddie programmed by lyman sheets um they made 4016 units and it has been

1306
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:12,120
lauded as one of the greatest pinball tables of all time um so uh another thing about this it is

1307
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:18,680
one of the few to have been re-released i will get to that in a moment i own the re-release

1308
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:28,840
so um basically it's got sort of a medieval castle theme you know and so as you're playing in the

1309
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:36,040
center of the play field there is an animated uh castle and it has a drawbridge and you know all

1310
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:41,240
kinds of stuff going on with it and your primary game is is to destroy six castles by hitting the

1311
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:46,840
castle's entryway with your pinball so a specific number of hits will lower the drawbridge and then

1312
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:53,640
expose the portcullis then um it will get that to rise and then you can keep shooting it and

1313
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:59,320
basically you get like light show and different points and everything and then it sort of falls

1314
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:04,200
apart and then it puts itself back together for the next mode um it also has two trolls which are

1315
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:10,520
animated targets um they are concealed below the play field and pop up during certain game modes

1316
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:17,080
and for some reason i always have trouble hitting one of those damn trolls um it also um you know

1317
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:21,720
you have like your your left and right lamps you've got your uh different orbits you have

1318
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:32,360
a catapult ramp um and so uh this particular though game introduced a feature that prevents

1319
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:37,560
a failed ramp from draining your shot down the middle between the flippers and that actually

1320
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:43,560
was patented with this machine um another little neat thing about this rob do you

1321
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:49,000
want to know who one of the voice actors in this game was uh no idea yeah sure who is it

1322
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:57,080
tina faye really yeah the voice for the opera singer princess and the cockney princess

1323
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:04,600
so i thought uh that was really cool so yeah tina faye was a voice actor in the game wow um

1324
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:11,160
oh the bad class of the game has the game listed as medieval madness and then the cabinet art says

1325
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:20,840
ye olde medieval madness um and you know it's it's a really just kind of fun you know

1326
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:28,920
very kind of almost an odd game for its theme so your different missions that you have is

1327
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:36,040
joust champion you have patron of peasants catapult ace defender of damsels master of

1328
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:42,120
trolls and castle crusher you have different multi-balls um you have castle multi-ball

1329
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:50,840
you have multi-ball madness which is really fun um and basically um you uh for each

1330
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:57,480
madness that you complete that you get different number of balls so single is two two to four is

1331
01:40:57,480 --> 01:41:05,080
three and five madness is four balls then you have barnyard multi-ball um when you shoot all

1332
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:10,040
the catapult items at the castle and then battle for the kingdom which is the uh it's a two-phase

1333
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:17,800
wizard mode um and i'm not going to go into all the rules on it but um for uh you know it's got

1334
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:28,200
so much going on with it um that uh it's just really kind of complex and really really just

1335
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:38,680
fun um so uh as far as ways to play if you don't have access to the table which by the way um just

1336
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:43,400
to let you know is that if you find an original medieval madness it'll go upwards of eight grand

1337
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:49,240
if they're in pristine when they and this is a contrast when they were new in 97 they

1338
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:56,840
were about three grand um so medieval madness was included in the williams volume one tables

1339
01:41:56,840 --> 01:42:06,840
for pinball fx3 um came out november 9th uh 2018 it was previously a dlc for pinball arcade until

1340
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:14,840
june 30th 2018 when williams removed them off for licensing um it is a playable table um on

1341
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:20,920
playstation 3 and xbox 360 versions the pinball hall of fame um the williams collection and it

1342
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:25,720
was included for ultra pin so now here's where we get to the

1343
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:34,920
they did uh two versions of it there's medieval madness remake and medieval madness remake limited

1344
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:43,480
edition they all come with a new color dmd they have led lights on the play field

1345
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:51,480
and we have the limited edition we had one on order and then as it worked out someone bought

1346
01:42:51,480 --> 01:43:01,800
one and we ended up buying it from them and this was released by a chicago gaming company

1347
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:08,280
um let me see if i can get just a little bit more because it had some other pretty

1348
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:16,040
pretty good stuff going on with this one like it had in fact uh you could get like a custom

1349
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:27,000
uh topper for it um had all kinds of neat stuff like our particular one um actually has uh like

1350
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:32,760
black legs on it it's really sleek looking but here's the here's the funny thing um

1351
01:43:34,440 --> 01:43:43,640
the um when you open up the um the you know the back glass and look inside um you know i don't

1352
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:50,120
know rob have you ever seen behind the back glass on a pinball or matt have you i don't think so no

1353
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:55,880
well normally with the with these older ones from the 90s you had a pretty large circuit board that

1354
01:43:55,880 --> 01:44:03,480
you know controlled the rules controlled all the mechanisms in the game and um this has a very

1355
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:14,280
tiny like maybe uh the width of a postcard in square so um the boards on the on this is is

1356
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:20,120
absolutely tiny and then of course the fact that it you know you get a color dmd with it which

1357
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:25,560
i mean a color dmd by itself is i want to say 500 something like that when you're adding one

1358
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:36,040
sort of aftermarket um but i mean it's if if anyone if anyone can find it i absolutely think

1359
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:41,080
that it's it's worth having the remake is tons of fun um let me see if you can find what the

1360
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:47,320
difference is with the limited edition um the limited okay so there we go i've got the chicago

1361
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:54,440
gaming company's website on this so um you can get yeah there's a royal edition that comes with

1362
01:44:54,440 --> 01:45:05,400
the king of pain p-a-y-n-e um and it's a fully sculpted um uh eight inch tall uh has integrated

1363
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:13,000
lighting uh that plays along with the game um and then the leds on it are interactive rgb

1364
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:22,680
general illumination was listed as and so it alters your your experience as it changes colors

1365
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:30,760
while you're playing um you have uh an extra large display so the display is pretty much i

1366
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:39,240
want to say twice as big as the original display and like i said it's color um and uh and i'll

1367
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:44,520
link this to people um it's the royal edition which is the one that we have it has the the

1368
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:51,880
powder coated black legs so um the classic one is basically just what the classic table was like

1369
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:57,000
right special edition is the one with all the leds and goodies and then there's the uh the

1370
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:03,560
royal edition that has the topper and everything so we we got lucky and got the uh the royal

1371
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:09,320
edition and i will link that in the chat room because i honestly think that it's worth looking

1372
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:18,600
at it's a really fun table you know what's funny is that um it's uh it's not really my favorite

1373
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:23,640
but i'm glad that we have one it's a really fun one to play um also to tell dark tuxedo

1374
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:29,960
they haven't uh just started doing color dmds they've been doing color dmds i want to say for

1375
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:35,480
at least the last decade so they're not a new thing they're just still expensive uh and one

1376
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:42,680
of the cool things about color dmds um is that you can go in and reprogram colors on it um no

1377
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:48,600
some of these newer tables was actually pretty cool like um we we have a metallica and we have

1378
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:57,880
a acdc and uh when we got our acdc uh the previous owner instead of putting acdc in it i want to say

1379
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:04,120
that he put in i don't remember what band he put in but it was a different band and um you know

1380
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:10,840
so you could switch out like different audio so if they're a lot more uh modifiable now um but uh

1381
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:18,440
i i really think that uh that if you see one of these in the wild and you have never played it

1382
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:28,040
you owe yourself to play medieval madness like i said it is one of the the peak pinball tables by

1383
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:35,560
many people's opinions um it's right up there with like i'd say adam's family you know as far as

1384
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:41,560
beloved tables um theater of magic you know theater magic isn't a great uh tournament table

1385
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:46,760
but it's it's up there with how well loved it is does that make sense oh yeah for sure maybe those

1386
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:51,480
are some tables that i definitely love those other ones she named and this is a good one too so yeah

1387
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:59,080
but i just like any game that starts off with i am the king of pain so there you go there it is your

1388
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:05,320
classic pinball table of the month medieval madness all right check that out uh one of the

1389
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:09,240
if you can find the original great and there's a lot of the the newer edition stuff out in the

1390
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:13,880
wild too or or uh so somebody had mentioned in chat earlier california extreme kind of has the

1391
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:18,280
original but with the modified uh colored uh display on it so which you see on some of those

1392
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:24,600
old tables so fun all right let's travel around quickly and check out some rapid fire news

1393
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:29,640
uh rapidly some other things happening around the industry uh bobby also pointing out that

1394
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:33,720
medieval madness is also in pinball f pinball fx3 of course that's what we were just showing

1395
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:40,360
there so yeah it's another way to get it i said that okay uh let's do rapid fire news loki

1396
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:49,160
so apparently the whole lego mario um line has been doing very well um i know i have most of

1397
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:55,080
them or i should say my kids have most of them um but they're not going to stop with just series one

1398
01:48:55,080 --> 01:49:00,680
they're actually going to be releasing a series two starting january 1st are they for your kids

1399
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:01,800
or are they for you

1400
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:11,720
my kids play with them i don't have them anywhere i may help build them sometimes

1401
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:18,040
all right but it's mainly for them um so they got some brand new stuff including a

1402
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:25,240
sets with a chain chomp in there uh they've got ones the wiggler and some new costumes including

1403
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:33,000
the penguin and tanuki marios um some new blind bag character sets with the poison mushroom

1404
01:49:33,640 --> 01:49:42,440
looks like parrot paragoombas shy guys and ninjis which are kind of cool um yeah and then they even

1405
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:51,400
have like a master your own like a create your own adventure maker set that has um one of the

1406
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:56,440
koopa kids in there as well and it's kind of more freeform set no new starter set so i thought they

1407
01:49:56,440 --> 01:50:01,800
would add like luigi to it to like a multiplayer or something but they haven't done that uh but

1408
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:10,040
yeah that'll be next year that'll be well they tend to do multiple series within a year and

1409
01:50:10,040 --> 01:50:16,280
considering that lego mario came out in august of this year i mean it's been running for about four

1410
01:50:16,280 --> 01:50:21,720
months so they have the opportunity to do multiple series when it comes out next year so

1411
01:50:22,680 --> 01:50:28,120
looks pretty cool so i kids are already wanting me to pick up all these so we'll see

1412
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:38,280
we're a few sets shy of having the entire series one and then along with that where we did get a

1413
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:44,680
tease that there's going to be a brand new map unveiled at the game awards for among us

1414
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:53,800
and uh the new map is actually looks like a crossover map so it apparently is uh the top hat

1415
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:59,320
clans airship from and i can't remember because my kids are telling me what it was i want to say

1416
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:05,320
like maybe the sick man adventures or something like that um but yeah it it looks pretty cool

1417
01:51:05,320 --> 01:51:10,360
so new maps um pretty awesome to see some crossover the other indie games as well

1418
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:18,280
neat all right well uh talking about game streaming as uh you know we've kind of brought

1419
01:51:18,280 --> 01:51:23,080
up previously on the show um there was some issues going on with the different apps being able to

1420
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:27,640
have game streaming on ios but they seem to have found a solution and that is to do

1421
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:33,240
web apps now uh we also talked about last week on the show that um app stadium which was like

1422
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:40,200
a fan app to get stadia running on ios well uh i guess you won't need that anymore because stadia

1423
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:47,000
game streaming is coming to ios via a official web app so uh that is happening the testing is

1424
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:52,360
supposed to start several weeks from now um but it's nice to have that confirmation i suppose that

1425
01:51:52,360 --> 01:51:56,760
that is coming what's interesting is that stadia is not the only one talking about using an ios

1426
01:51:56,760 --> 01:52:02,600
web app this week nvidia uh brought their g force now game streaming service to ios

1427
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:10,600
so they are also on a web app um it did launch uh this week it is saying beta though that way

1428
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:16,200
you might run into some issues there but um yeah that is uh also out there so that's kind of

1429
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:23,480
interesting um moving on to a story about the supplies for the xbox series x apparently

1430
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:30,360
microsoft is expecting shortages to continue well into april um microsoft isn't talking about how

1431
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:34,360
many consoles they sell anymore they haven't done that for quite some time and you might remember

1432
01:52:34,360 --> 01:52:38,280
earlier in the show i don't think they really care i think it's the game pass stuff they want

1433
01:52:38,280 --> 01:52:43,080
to keep touting um but anyway this is uh from that same conference where tim stewart the chief

1434
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:47,640
financial officer was saying those other things i talked about earlier he also said that he's

1435
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:54,200
seeing these shortages continue into the first quarter of next year meaning through march so um

1436
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:59,000
whether the pandemic is to blame for that or high demand to blame for that or all of those things

1437
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:06,600
um is unknown but um it's probably all those things to be quite honest so uh yeah unfortunately

1438
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:12,040
those shortages will be continuing into next year um i noticed dark sakura stepped away is she back

1439
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:19,480
okay yeah i'm back i'm sorry i had it i had my video off so no one would see me

1440
01:53:19,480 --> 01:53:23,080
nomming down on my salad no problem i just don't want to miss your stories

1441
01:53:23,960 --> 01:53:33,560
yeah no i can miss them it's okay um so there's a recent um a study from um it's an oxford study

1442
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:42,840
that went to nintendo and electronic arts for um uh playtime for for different games so uh games

1443
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:48,760
used in this were um animal crossing new horizons and plants versus zombies uh battle for the

1444
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:55,480
neighborhood and the data uh led to uh well basically first of all it was to give a more

1445
01:53:55,480 --> 01:54:02,040
accurate understanding about how long people spent playing the game um and then um they saw

1446
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:09,720
that they were able to find a correlation between uh the gameplay behavior and their subjective

1447
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:16,520
well-being so that they could show that these video games have actually been really good for

1448
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:24,040
mental health um and uh they one of the the things uh they said i'll actually read from what one of

1449
01:54:24,040 --> 01:54:29,240
the researchers said is uh they found that the player's in-game experience may be more critical

1450
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:33,560
for their well-being than merely the amount of time they spent playing players who derive

1451
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:39,640
genuine enjoyment from the game's experience more positive well-being so i think that's pretty cool

1452
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:43,720
i could tell you that i mean shoot i would have probably gone nuts if i didn't have animal crossing

1453
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:56,200
um so um also um uh itch.io is doing something a little bit different for black friday

1454
01:54:56,840 --> 01:55:03,640
um they're gonna run the sale like everyone else but they're gonna forgo their cut of the game

1455
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:10,520
sales and give the developers that share of revenue for the day that's neat so um it's going

1456
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:19,160
to be active uh starting at uh 3 a.m eastern time midnight pacific on november 27th so if a

1457
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:25,160
developer wants to include their games in the sale then um they can lower the price of their games

1458
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:32,840
during that and still make a pretty tidy profit so uh they also have a massive pay what you uh

1459
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:36,200
that's right this was the one that they did before where they did the pay what you want bundle

1460
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:42,840
uh for uh the n double acp uh legal defense and education fund so cool oh very cool

1461
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:49,640
all right well let's move on and travel around the world and check out some release dates of

1462
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:54,280
games that are coming out this week this is kind of the last chance before black friday

1463
01:55:55,320 --> 01:56:00,520
yeah not a whole lot usually comes up this week so uh we do have one significant thing so world of

1464
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:08,680
warcraft shadowlands uh still coming to pcmx uh just dance 2021 on playstation 5 and xbox series x

1465
01:56:09,640 --> 01:56:18,840
we've got star renegades on playstation 4 vigor on playstation 4 and looks like last but not least

1466
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:26,280
spirit of north enhanced edition on playstation 5 that is it all right well traveling over to japan

1467
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:31,400
it's still you know the the thanksgiving holiday is uh not really an impact over there so they

1468
01:56:31,400 --> 01:56:36,360
still have a pretty full week for game releases uh and this actually all comes out on november

1469
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:42,760
26th so this week on the nintendo switch we have zoids wild infinity blast is out as well as

1470
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:49,000
food girls in a regular and limited edition uh moonlighter and saints row four re-elected the

1471
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:54,200
japanese uh version of that is out this week uh all of that of course on the nintendo switch

1472
01:56:54,200 --> 01:57:00,840
um taking a look at the playstation 5 uh it looks like uh just dance 2021 is out of japan this week

1473
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:05,880
as well as an ultimate edition of watchdogs legion oh that is paired with a uh non-ultimate

1474
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:11,400
edition as well so japan gets their version of that this week and then looking at the playstation

1475
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:21,080
4 for the releases there um koi suru otome to shugo no tatse reboot the shield 9 in regular and

1476
01:57:21,080 --> 01:57:24,840
limited edition well that is quite the mouthful i wonder if that is based off an anime that i'm

1477
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:30,600
unaware of i'm trying to load the page to see more information off that um wow there's two

1478
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:35,080
checks on the cover of this and one of them is pointing a gun at me so that's an interesting

1479
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:39,720
piece of box art there but yeah i'm thinking that is uh based off an anime or manga um

1480
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:44,520
but other things coming out in japan this week on the playstation 4 this is pretty neat the dead by

1481
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:50,120
daylight uh is getting excuse me dead by daylight is getting a silent hill edition so they're

1482
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:54,280
getting like a physical release of dead by daylight but with the silent hill stuff um that

1483
01:57:54,280 --> 01:57:58,760
was put out for that game not that long ago in japan maybe to get more the audience over there

1484
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:03,400
excited about it of course that game continues to do um pretty well i see people streaming it on

1494
01:59:12,440 --> 01:59:17,320
you guys before we open it up for questions from chat and further comments on things we either

1495
01:59:17,320 --> 01:59:20,760
have or haven't talked about tonight but we'll get to that in a little bit first we have some

1496
01:59:20,760 --> 01:59:27,320
more stories loki yes i don't play any grand theft auto online although maybe i'll change

1497
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:34,760
and go back to it at some point but we did get a tease though that there is um some new uh stuff

1498
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:43,400
coming to grant the federal line line soon so they've got the new uh ko perico heist uh which

1499
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:50,120
is gonna be a uh new location in grand theft auto online so they actually had a small map

1500
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:59,560
expansion new interiors and whatnot um we haven't really gotten any new map expansions since the

1501
01:59:59,560 --> 02:00:05,560
game launched um kind of disappointing we never really got any dlc for it aside from

1502
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:11,640
grant the thought online i mean i used lost and damned and um valley gay tony were great in four

1503
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:17,240
but we never got any story expansions like that and five which is kind of unfortunate

1504
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:23,080
but started off they um teased it a little bit with this teaser trailer that launched

1505
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:29,320
that kind of showed a little bit of this new location and then of course um now they have

1506
02:00:29,320 --> 02:00:35,320
new dead bodies washing ashore um they kind of go along with that as well but they're apparently

1507
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:39,880
this brand new private island or something is going to be a new place that we can check out in

1508
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:45,480
december and they're saying they're also announcing a new radio station featuring over 100 new songs

1509
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:53,080
to get you dmca flagged on twitch right away yeah don't don't stream on twitch if you're

1510
02:00:53,080 --> 02:01:00,840
listening to that radio station so looking forward to checking that out all right well earlier in the

1511
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:07,880
show i was teasing uh some stuff about playstation and perhaps their uh competitor to game pass and

1512
02:01:07,880 --> 02:01:13,240
uh this is all coming from some comments that were made by the uh ceo of sony interactive

1513
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:19,880
entertainment jim ryan he was actually speaking to a russian outlet named t a s s about playstation

1514
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:24,680
5 launching there because obviously the playstation 5 is all over the world now i know we

1515
02:01:24,680 --> 02:01:30,200
got it a week early in the us and japan but um the uk had their release this last week as well as

1516
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:34,760
everywhere else in the world so there's a lot more interviews and such to support playstation

1517
02:01:34,760 --> 02:01:41,400
5 this week um he was asked about the competition with microsoft and what are some of the points of

1518
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:47,480
differentiation and he actually said the that console wars it's not a term that he likes to use

1519
02:01:47,480 --> 02:01:52,920
or that he likes it's great that there's competition i think it makes us work harder it avoids us

1520
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:58,520
getting complacent it's great that the consumer has a choice i think that's wonderful now that

1521
02:01:58,520 --> 02:02:06,600
led into a discussion on game pass there is actually news to come but just not today we have

1522
02:02:06,600 --> 02:02:12,200
playstation now which is our subscription service and that is available in a number of markets

1523
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:18,360
let's take a minute to roll our eyes at that answer because that's not quite the same thing

1524
02:02:18,920 --> 02:02:25,240
um i'm sorry but it pales in comparison to what microsoft is doing with the direct emulation

1525
02:02:25,240 --> 02:02:29,560
of the older titles in the library now granted not everything is supported you heard too that

1526
02:02:29,560 --> 02:02:35,880
they weren't even talking that they're asked about um expanding that playstation plus gold

1527
02:02:35,880 --> 02:02:41,640
or whatever collection the playstation plus collection yeah they were talking about um

1528
02:02:41,640 --> 02:02:44,360
whether they were to expand it or not they're not even sure they're gonna do that

1529
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:53,400
yep it's just it's just a bonus on top of playstation plus so um well games uh the game

1530
02:02:53,400 --> 02:03:00,440
wars are right around the corner they like doing announcements at those things so maybe

1531
02:03:01,320 --> 02:03:07,640
i i feel like it's too soon for sony to do it now when they did just put out that playstation

1532
02:03:07,640 --> 02:03:12,440
plus collection and a lot of people still can't get a playstation 5 i'm not sure this is something

1533
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:16,600
they have to respond to right this minute especially when microsoft doesn't really have

1534
02:03:16,600 --> 02:03:22,120
first party titles for the new era on game pass right now i think sony wants to be thinking about

1535
02:03:22,120 --> 02:03:28,040
that for next year um but i honestly i would expect if sony is going to counter with their

1536
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:32,760
own type of game pass and they've got some big partners involved in that that maybe aren't as

1537
02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:39,080
involved in game pass perhaps some more japanese centric companies maybe your capcoms your konami's

1538
02:03:39,080 --> 02:03:45,480
although konami's not really making games anymore but who knows um stuff from that library uh we

1539
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:52,520
we might see that i would think e3 2021 is when sony responds to it officially but maybe sooner

1540
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:56,280
who knows a game developers conference even though that's not really a news place so you

1541
02:03:56,280 --> 02:03:59,640
shouldn't look at it as one and plus it's the day and age the internet they can announce it

1542
02:03:59,640 --> 02:04:05,880
whenever they want but i i kind of feel like too early to see what the impact is going to be on

1543
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:11,000
games pass right now with their console i don't know if they can really say that we're losing a

1544
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:15,560
lot of sales because of that no they're both selling out they're both doing well that's why

1545
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:20,280
i don't think sony has to respond till the next fiscal year and that's why i don't expect an

1546
02:04:20,280 --> 02:04:27,400
announcement before april that's my that's my take on it um you know that i think it's weird

1547
02:04:27,400 --> 02:04:31,000
that he said you know we have nothing to announce now he almost made it sound like it's coming soon

1548
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:35,400
but i i think it's still way too soon playstation 5 is doing nothing wrong it's still selling out

1549
02:04:35,400 --> 02:04:40,360
and hard to get same thing with xbox series x now whether the pandemic's to blame for some of

1550
02:04:40,360 --> 02:04:44,360
those supply issues i don't know but they're selling what they're making so they've got to

1551
02:04:44,360 --> 02:04:49,320
be happy with that so i i'm sure they'll be looking to it next year i think we will see

1552
02:04:49,320 --> 02:04:53,880
something that's a little more elevated and i don't think they will enhance playstation

1553
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:59,560
plus collection i think that speculation is right on the money i think uh playstation plus collection

1554
02:04:59,560 --> 02:05:06,040
was to try to give more incentive to get a playstation 5 when there is a lack of launch

1555
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:13,720
titles sure demon souls sure the astro astro bot and uh that stuff but there's not it's that's not

1556
02:05:13,720 --> 02:05:18,040
enough you guys you know especially when you compare it to some of the prior launches when

1557
02:05:18,040 --> 02:05:22,360
you look at you know all the titles that were out there when playstation 2 is new so i just i

1558
02:05:23,560 --> 02:05:28,920
i think that was all and to be fair xbox has the exact same problem because they had to push a lot

1559
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:36,760
of their stuff back every every week i i don't think microsoft has a single exclusive this year

1560
02:05:36,760 --> 02:05:42,760
now for the new systems i think the last one just got pushed back this last week was it mastermind

1561
02:05:42,760 --> 02:05:46,040
or what i don't remember what's called but there was another one that got pushed back this week

1562
02:05:46,760 --> 02:05:53,480
so oh was it that uh the one that was like that uh time loop one

1563
02:05:54,920 --> 02:06:01,480
i think so i don't i don't even remember yeah uh dj rama s says can you really call it a

1564
02:06:01,480 --> 02:06:05,640
console exclusive when the games are coming out on current gen systems twitch bobby blackwell

1565
02:06:05,640 --> 02:06:11,560
follows up astro's playroom is literally playstation 5 exclusive and i think that's it

1566
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:20,600
i guess pre-installed technically demon souls remake is exclusive but yes that is a remake

1567
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:28,040
of a playstation 3 game of course but um technically uh that that remake is a new

1568
02:06:28,040 --> 02:06:33,720
release and it's exclusive to playstation 5 uh bugsnax is not exclusive to playstation 5

1569
02:06:33,720 --> 02:06:38,920
it is also on playstation 4 it is free on playstation 5 if you have playstation plus

1570
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:43,000
only on playstation 5 it is not free on playstation 4

1571
02:06:44,120 --> 02:06:49,480
it's very interesting and i hear it's not that bad of a game yeah i'm hearing it's kind of neat

1572
02:06:49,480 --> 02:06:58,200
yeah so all right moving on dark sakura with some classics yes how about the sega ages

1573
02:06:59,080 --> 02:07:05,720
i like sega ages yeah um collection yeah although some of the the 2500 ones were kind of weird

1574
02:07:06,600 --> 02:07:15,800
but at any rate um sega um has wrapped up the sega ages line um it's uh uh for the switch

1575
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:22,680
sorry it's given us some really cool stuff we've been very happy very extensive um but what was the

1576
02:07:22,680 --> 02:07:30,280
most popular so it all really depends on where you are and so there was um an interview with

1577
02:07:30,280 --> 02:07:38,280
nintendo everything um so kodama reiko um uh okunari gosuke and uh matsuoka chiyoshi

1578
02:07:40,040 --> 02:07:44,040
in order we have the producer director then supervisor and then the m2 director

1579
02:07:44,040 --> 02:07:50,760
and we're talking about the biggest hit so in japan virtual racing was the most popular um

1580
02:07:50,760 --> 02:07:57,400
overseas they said uh it was sonic and then followed by outrun and outrun was super big

1581
02:07:57,400 --> 02:08:05,400
in europe in particular but they did notice um that p.o p.o got a lot of attention but that

1582
02:08:05,400 --> 02:08:13,480
was also only in japan i like p.o p.o yeah sega ages was a pretty good it was a good way of doing

1583
02:08:13,480 --> 02:08:16,520
the retro stuff because they did some really nice upgrades with that i still have to go back and get

1584
02:08:16,520 --> 02:08:21,240
a few i really wanted the fantasy star one where it actually mapped the dungeons as you were doing

1585
02:08:21,240 --> 02:08:24,520
them because that was one of the most tedious parts of the game with those dungeons and now

1586
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:33,320
they actually map them so that's pretty cool i i i very much would have uh loved to um have

1587
02:08:33,320 --> 02:08:40,520
like just a big uh fantasy star like completely redone um with all those features as well but

1588
02:08:40,520 --> 02:08:48,200
like uh the full quadrology quartet yeah yeah i just say quartet because that's another sega

1589
02:08:48,200 --> 02:08:58,920
thing quartet yeah all right let's move on loki all right so uh this is kind of a cool little

1590
02:08:58,920 --> 02:09:05,640
tribute that they did in spider-man malice moralis so as you may remember uh chadwick

1591
02:09:05,640 --> 02:09:11,800
bozeman who played black panther in the marvel cinematic universe passed away this earlier this

1592
02:09:11,800 --> 02:09:19,320
year and as kind of a little bit of a tribute in the game they have hidden a bozeman way

1593
02:09:20,440 --> 02:09:27,400
bozeman way i guess and which is located on the stretch of 42nd street between third avenue and

1594
02:09:27,400 --> 02:09:34,600
first avenue and they said that this is um possibly to um because his breakout film i

1595
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:42,680
guess was in this uh a biographical film 42 and that um it's kind of a tribute to that so it's

1596
02:09:42,680 --> 02:09:48,440
kind of neat to see that the developers give him a nod in this game as well because he was

1597
02:09:48,440 --> 02:09:55,320
so influential um with the fans of you know definitely the marvel universe so um yeah it's

1598
02:09:55,320 --> 02:10:01,080
pretty nice yeah and i highly doubt that's the last tribute we see in a video game either or

1599
02:10:01,080 --> 02:10:09,480
yeah media period yeah all right well speaking of other media um our last story tonight has to do

1600
02:10:09,480 --> 02:10:15,800
with the last of us officially getting a tv adaptation we've had rumors of it we know that

1601
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:22,600
one was being shopped around well guess what hbo is picking it up um hbo has been doing a lot of

1602
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:27,000
interesting stuff recently you know obviously i'm sure you all heard the news this week about hbo

1603
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:33,080
max and how they got the wonder woman 84 uh release so because obviously theaters are

1604
02:10:34,360 --> 02:10:38,680
not really a thing right now in most parts of the country at least where we live for sure and where

1605
02:10:38,680 --> 02:10:43,240
i think many of you are in big cities there's not really theaters i i guess some cities are still

1606
02:10:43,240 --> 02:10:48,840
doing it but you know every place is handling covet differently the reality is new york and la

1607
02:10:48,840 --> 02:10:54,520
the two biggest markets don't have theaters right now um so it's hard for movie companies to really

1608
02:10:54,520 --> 02:11:01,160
do a release especially of a big budget film like wonder woman 84 bobby blackwell is pointing out

1609
02:11:01,160 --> 02:11:05,560
in his area they're open they're just not very packed that's right just because they're open

1610
02:11:05,560 --> 02:11:09,160
doesn't mean people are willing to go because of everything going on people know that there's a

1611
02:11:09,160 --> 02:11:16,120
risk with it um so anyway uh hbo is uh gonna be getting that wonder woman 84 movie it will come

1612
02:11:16,120 --> 02:11:23,000
out on hbo max the same day it's in theaters which i believe is christmas the 25th um is

1613
02:11:23,480 --> 02:11:30,120
so that's interesting uh and uh you know we know that disney plus has uh mulan and they the rumor

1614
02:11:30,120 --> 02:11:38,120
is uh that cruella deville movie uh with what's her name playing cruella that reminds me of

1615
02:11:38,120 --> 02:11:44,600
victoria what's emma stone is that her name that's it she's playing cruella that rumor is that that

1616
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:48,040
movie is going to end up being a digital thing on disney plus and i think there's a couple others

1617
02:11:48,040 --> 02:11:51,640
on the disney front i didn't even know that was an actual movie that's coming out yeah there's a

1618
02:11:51,640 --> 02:11:56,280
there's a picture of their out there of her as cruella she looks the part she looks really good

1619
02:11:56,280 --> 02:12:03,560
and she for those of you that remember victoria on shaking and crying uh the the day i saw what

1620
02:12:03,560 --> 02:12:09,560
was that movie that she was in with anna ferris the sorority girl damn it i can't think of that

1621
02:12:09,560 --> 02:12:14,760
movie there's a comedy and it was like how funny the house bunny yes that's it thank you the house

1622
02:12:14,760 --> 02:12:21,000
i don't know how i know that but i do you know what you just won jeopardy congrats so uh the

1623
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:25,400
house bunny when i saw that movie the very first thing when i saw emma stone i was like oh my god

1624
02:12:25,400 --> 02:12:29,480
this is victoria and i texted victoria and i'm like you need to see the house bunny because this

1625
02:12:29,480 --> 02:12:34,760
chick is you this is funny so and then victoria ended up meeting her because she went to bra she

1626
02:12:34,760 --> 02:12:39,400
was in a broadway version of uh cabaret or something anyway i'm really getting disconnected

1627
02:12:39,400 --> 02:12:46,520
sorry but one tangent leads to another um anyhow so how did i get on and oh yes the digital releases

1628
02:12:46,600 --> 02:12:53,000
on hbo max which is trying to build themselves up because this is the new reality we're in now

1629
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:59,480
everybody wants a netflix and we knew this was coming netflix hulu cbs or whatever they're

1630
02:12:59,480 --> 02:13:03,880
going to rebrand it as paramount or whatever it's called uh what are what are all the others i can't

1631
02:13:03,880 --> 02:13:11,480
even name them all now uh hbo max uh what are the other pay tv stuff peacock peacock uh we

1632
02:13:11,480 --> 02:13:17,560
technically don't have to pay for that one right yeah so anyway there's they're all out there so

1633
02:13:17,560 --> 02:13:24,120
hbo max is going to be going through with their uh adaptation of the last of us to enhance that

1634
02:13:24,120 --> 02:13:28,440
and that's another one of those places where i think netflix and what they did with the video

1635
02:13:28,440 --> 02:13:35,320
game adaptation of the witcher can kind of yes it was a book but you know it definitely reminded

1636
02:13:35,320 --> 02:13:40,200
a lot of people in the video game uh and it led to other video game stuff too which netflix has

1637
02:13:40,200 --> 02:13:44,840
had great success with castlevania and all that other stuff anyway so now other streaming companies

1638
02:13:44,840 --> 02:13:51,400
are looking to video games for potential stories so the last of us is happening uh hbo has confirmed

1639
02:13:51,400 --> 02:13:56,840
that the writer and creative director behind the last of us neil drachman will pen the series and

1640
02:13:56,840 --> 02:14:02,920
produce the series it's going to be alongside the creator of chernobyl uh craig mazin sony

1641
02:14:02,920 --> 02:14:09,320
playstation productions will produce the series what was i didn't even know there was a sony

1642
02:14:09,320 --> 02:14:13,240
playstation productions what was the last thing they would have done the tester tester

1643
02:14:15,160 --> 02:14:23,560
i don't know anyway the series will be about the first game so it will not necessarily be

1644
02:14:23,560 --> 02:14:28,680
the second game i don't know if that's for a season two or what that what happens does it end

1645
02:14:28,680 --> 02:14:33,320
up going like the walking dead where it completely outpaces i don't know we have to see how the first

1646
02:14:33,320 --> 02:14:40,120
season does first but hbo has greenlit the production and um that's that's it it's moving

1647
02:14:40,120 --> 02:14:45,320
forward so we'll see when it's going to come out probably i would say earliest is like holiday next

1648
02:14:45,320 --> 02:14:50,360
year and that's that's cutting it close uh especially with all the covid stuff i mean i know

1649
02:14:50,360 --> 02:14:55,400
they're filming things again with precautions and stuff but they might put it off especially if they

1650
02:14:55,400 --> 02:15:00,760
want to have like hordes of zombies and things they they might put it off for a little bit so

1651
02:15:00,760 --> 02:15:06,520

1657
02:15:35,800 --> 02:15:40,680
here but that's a show i haven't watched in months i i know they have all the the way behind

1658
02:15:40,680 --> 02:15:47,080
they have like drag race holland drag race canada drag race spain is coming but i'm i'm i'm worn out

1659
02:15:48,440 --> 02:15:55,240
yeah you're you're all drug out you're dragged yeah you got dragged all right but if you guys

1660
02:15:55,240 --> 02:15:59,480
have uh questions or comments in our chat uh we'll open it up quickly for some chat comments

1661
02:15:59,480 --> 02:16:05,800
over twitch.tv slash vog network uh if you have some chat comments you want to get in here i will

1662
02:16:05,800 --> 02:16:12,680
ask though of course loki if you have any last minute stories of course so there was a video

1663
02:16:12,680 --> 02:16:18,920
put out by sack smashing um i think it was last week actually talking about the brand new game

1664
02:16:18,920 --> 02:16:26,360
and watch handheld system and of course the question is can you hack it um so he found a way

1665
02:16:26,360 --> 02:16:35,160
to hack the hack the game to um system to be able to inject a custom modified version of

1666
02:16:36,280 --> 02:16:40,760
super mario brothers to put you know hack mario brothers or whatever but that wasn't enough

1667
02:16:40,760 --> 02:16:47,960
because the the question that's always on people's minds is can it run doom and well he's managed to

1668
02:16:47,960 --> 02:16:55,880
get doom to run on it just a very stripped down version of doom that um he had to take some of the

1669
02:16:55,960 --> 02:17:00,920
textures out and everything because it is got very limited space it only has a one megabyte of

1670
02:17:00,920 --> 02:17:07,320
storage uh one megabyte of ram and so it's obviously very limited space that they could

1671
02:17:07,320 --> 02:17:16,840
run at but it runs sort of kind of in theory it runs do you have to is it so slow that you have

1672
02:17:16,840 --> 02:17:21,960
to play doom in that scaled down tiny window within your tiny window it is scaled down a

1673
02:17:21,960 --> 02:17:27,000
little bit it's not like for the game watch system i think it's about 80 of the screen

1674
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:32,520
so i mean that's not bad but like that it's not a very strong processor that's in there in the

1675
02:17:32,520 --> 02:17:38,840
first place um and yeah with not having a lot of storage on there anyways i think we can rule out

1676
02:17:38,840 --> 02:17:45,640
like dumping a ton of nas games to it but it's still a neat hack yeah and if you want to play

1677
02:17:45,640 --> 02:17:51,720
doom there are literally five thousand other places you can play do anything else you name

1678
02:17:51,720 --> 02:17:57,400
it with a screen doom's on it a pregnancy test which is real yes i know pregnancy does

1679
02:18:00,040 --> 02:18:06,120
all right anything else that's all i had so one thing i noticed we didn't bring up tonight at all

1680
02:18:06,120 --> 02:18:09,720
it didn't come up on bobby's show it didn't come up here on this show i have to say something about

1681
02:18:09,720 --> 02:18:17,640
it it's that whole capcom stuff going on now the capcom there so there it's not a capcom leak

1682
02:18:17,640 --> 02:18:24,920
it's a capcom hostage situation um capcom had uh their information broken we have brought it

1683
02:18:24,920 --> 02:18:30,680
up previous weeks on the show um and they basically took all this information and were

1684
02:18:30,680 --> 02:18:35,160
saying uh you got to give us bitcoin or we're going to put the information out there uh they

1685
02:18:35,160 --> 02:18:41,080
did not give the bitcoin so the information's starting to get out there um that's up to you

1686
02:18:41,080 --> 02:18:45,160
if you want to go looking for that or not i kind of was like do i want to talk about it do i not

1687
02:18:45,160 --> 02:18:51,800
want to talk about it do i talk about last week at the end of the show yeah yeah and uh but well

1688
02:18:51,800 --> 02:18:57,080
there's more there's real specifics that came out within the last few days i'll say this much um

1689
02:18:57,080 --> 02:19:01,560
because this is one of those well of course this was happening me mentioning this of course this is

1690
02:19:01,560 --> 02:19:06,280
happening there's information there out there about street fighter six which okay that's one

1691
02:19:06,280 --> 02:19:10,200
of those of course it's happening at some point but there's information about that out there i'm

1692
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:16,360
not going to get into the details because it does feel a little dirty at the same time here

1693
02:19:16,360 --> 02:19:22,760
at orange launch radio this is you know you know video games gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle

1694
02:19:22,760 --> 02:19:26,600
and unfortunately i think what's going on out there with all the news it's kind of becoming

1695
02:19:26,600 --> 02:19:31,240
a part of culture so i'm a little bit torn on the appropriateness of what there is to talk about

1696
02:19:31,800 --> 02:19:38,360
at the end of the day capcom may change some of those plans um there's things in there about

1697
02:19:38,360 --> 02:19:44,600
localized games and things you might be excited about uh and all that but 2020 and this year

1698
02:19:45,240 --> 02:19:52,600
may have changed everything so i wouldn't put too much stock in anything that would have leaked out

1699
02:19:53,240 --> 02:19:58,920
and uh if you want to go looking for that and looking up that information then you know whatever

1700
02:19:58,920 --> 02:20:03,560
but uh you know and i found it i've come across it's been hard to avoid on twitter but just just

1701
02:20:03,560 --> 02:20:10,040
know where it came from that's that's really all i'm gonna say i will say this i will mention one

1702
02:20:10,040 --> 02:20:15,720
of the things that they discovered that um i think this is one of the things where capcom wasn't

1703
02:20:15,720 --> 02:20:19,880
saying anything about it openly um but it's one of those things where when i tell you what it is

1704
02:20:19,880 --> 02:20:25,480
you'll kind of go like that is pretty cool that capcom is doing that and that is that it was noted

1705
02:20:25,480 --> 02:20:33,160
that capcom is making some real pushes internally to diversify things within their different games

1706
02:20:33,160 --> 02:20:41,160
to have more strong female representation to have more lgbtq to have more ethnic representation of

1707
02:20:41,160 --> 02:20:45,320
different races ethnicities and so forth around the world and what's interesting is they actually

1708
02:20:45,320 --> 02:20:49,000
were calling out like good examples and bad examples in the industries they were talking

1709
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:55,160
about like last of us being like some good stuff uh for lgbtq at least a tomb raider for like

1710
02:20:55,160 --> 02:21:03,320
strong female characters um not so great uh old mario and old zelda but look at how zelda has

1711
02:21:03,320 --> 02:21:09,880
kind of transformed a little bit uh where it's no longer the damsel in distress but zelda's

1712
02:21:09,880 --> 02:21:14,280
you know you still can't play as zelda in the game i think that's coming in the next breath

1713
02:21:14,280 --> 02:21:18,760
of the wild but that's neither here nor there um but you can in the hyrule warriors and all that

1714
02:21:18,760 --> 02:21:25,000
stuff so it is interesting that capcom is making that push internally to do that so yes that is one

1715
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:31,400
thing that the the uh ransom exposed but it's one of those kind of like well neat that capcom

1716
02:21:31,400 --> 02:21:36,680
wasn't going to trout information about look at the good we're doing but they are doing it

1717
02:21:36,680 --> 02:21:43,000
internally and they are having those discussions and that part's at least pretty cool so um

1718
02:21:44,440 --> 02:21:50,840
let's see oh no comments in chat really so that's that yeah so uh uh good luck to um capcom on

1719
02:21:50,840 --> 02:21:56,360
dealing with all that and uh the the apparently there is some information in there we kind of

1720
02:21:56,360 --> 02:22:01,960
got into it last week i don't think we need to say too much more about it um that's it i don't

1721
02:22:01,960 --> 02:22:05,960
really see a lot of questions in chat so i think we're at the point to to wrap it all up for the

1722
02:22:05,960 --> 02:22:12,360
night dark soccer's voice is spent i'm ready to eat i haven't had a lot of food today so i think

1723
02:22:12,360 --> 02:22:16,120
we're gonna wrap up let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts first off i want

1737
02:23:21,480 --> 02:23:31,480
uh dark sakura what's your final thought two things um i look at my blog gen x geeks dot com

1738
02:23:31,480 --> 02:23:41,720
g e e x and i want everyone to consider um going to random acts dot org and doing their uh 10

1739
02:23:41,720 --> 02:23:48,520
pieces of kindness challenge do your part to be kind to others and kind to yourself it's

1740
02:23:48,520 --> 02:23:54,200
it's absolutely worth it you might find that taking the time out just to do a simple kindness

1741
02:23:54,200 --> 02:24:03,880
for another person can absolutely change your day and theirs and my final thought on this

1742
02:24:03,880 --> 02:24:10,440
thanksgiving week is i am thankful to people who are canceling or heavily modifying their

1743
02:24:10,440 --> 02:24:16,040
thanksgiving plans because they're taking um what's going on very seriously and i find it very

1744
02:24:16,040 --> 02:24:21,560
unfortunate and um sad and in some ways kind of sick that there are people out there who would

1745
02:24:21,560 --> 02:24:27,640
make it a point to brag about how they plan to have you know 36 people together for thanksgiving

1746
02:24:27,640 --> 02:24:33,000
uh this year because um they don't believe in what's going on out there in the world and i

1747
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:38,600
find that kind of sad that people would uh have such irregardless disrespect for other human

1748
02:24:38,600 --> 02:24:46,280
beings that they are willing to silently spread uh this particular virus um by continuing to do

1749
02:24:46,280 --> 02:24:52,200
this by being unwilling to make the small changes that are necessary for us to get through this

1750
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:57,880
together so for those of you that are taking this shit seriously i thank you and for those that

1751
02:24:57,880 --> 02:25:03,800
choose to flaunt and brag and rub it in our face that i'm gonna do what i always want because this

1752
02:25:03,800 --> 02:25:11,720
is fake and made up a nice hearty fucksgiving to you loki your final thought i'm gonna be working

1753
02:25:11,720 --> 02:25:20,520
on my game because i got extra time off so oh really just focusing on getting all the core

1754
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:25,400
coding stuff done and i have a lot of assets i gotta put together because i have a lot of

1755
02:25:25,400 --> 02:25:30,920
artwork and stuff and i found some more music to put in there as well so just have to get it all

1756
02:25:30,920 --> 02:25:37,560
in there in working order goals to have it released before the end of the year so still

1757
02:25:37,560 --> 02:25:41,880
shooting for that i'm gonna be thankful for the day i finally get to play your fucking game

1758
02:25:44,520 --> 02:25:49,880
all right sounds good all right thanks you guys stay safe out there happy gaming with all those

1759
02:25:49,880 --> 02:25:54,440
of you that are modifying your plans uh for this year uh i wanted to make sure i include heavy

1760
02:25:54,440 --> 02:25:58,440
modifications because i know a lot of people are gonna you know like some situations can't be

1761
02:25:58,440 --> 02:26:03,640
totally changed but people are making modifications so i'm sure this means that

1762
02:26:03,640 --> 02:26:09,160
you know thursday friday uh means a lot extra gaming time for those of you out there so enjoy

1763
02:26:09,160 --> 02:26:15,000
it play games to those of you that are working retail my thoughts are with you on friday i would

1764
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:20,520
hope that this year is going to be different in that regard um unfortunately due to the little

1765
02:26:20,520 --> 02:26:24,760
rant i just gave i think there's some elements of it especially depending on where you are

1766
02:26:24,760 --> 02:26:30,520
that are not going to be different so um just my thoughts are with all of you hard-working retail

1767
02:26:30,520 --> 02:26:36,360
folks uh this weekend so that's it have a great week enjoy your video games we'll be back in seven
