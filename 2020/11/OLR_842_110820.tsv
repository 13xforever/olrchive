0	14140	Twas the weekend of Hype Town and all through the stream, chatters were buzzing while waiting
14140	19440	to see, when stores unlock orders and go down a lot, while mashing their teeth and blaming
19440	20800	the bots.
20800	23040	Rhyming is hard, especially this next part.
23040	25960	Welcome your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki.
25960	26960	Do I have to rhyme?
26960	27960	Eh, fart.
28680	31720	This expected news and so much more, rejoice!
31720	35320	Starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
41320	46520	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and Jason, who did an excellent job with that
46520	47520	intro.
47520	53440	And welcome back everybody to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
53480	59120	We are live once again tonight with episode number 842 of our show for this November the
59120	61040	8th of 2020.
61040	66120	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me via Discord, as is the way we've been doing things
66120	67320	in 2020.
67320	70360	Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
70360	71360	Hello.
71360	73720	Hello, and how are you doing?
73720	74720	I'm okay.
74720	76360	Okay, good good.
76360	81040	I know you're a big fan of Supernatural, because you talked about that the past couple weeks
81040	82140	on the show.
82140	87100	And I actually was under the understanding that I thought the big finale, the end of
87100	89020	it, was this past week, but I'm wrong.
89020	90900	There's like two more episodes, right?
90900	92500	Yeah, there's two more episodes.
92500	96260	It's just that the shippers have been losing their shit.
96260	100500	Even Alan brought me up to speed on what happened in the last episode, because apparently it
100500	102140	was a big deal.
102140	105500	And I have the script of that scene right in front of me.
105500	106500	It was one-sided.
106500	107500	Oh, okay.
107500	109500	Was that like a charity thing?
109500	111920	No, I just have a picture of it.
111920	119720	But it's one-sided as far as the declarer versus the declaree.
119720	126240	And it puts me back to wanting all forms of love to be respected.
126240	132480	That it's fine for two people to love each other differently.
132480	136160	For one to be in love and the other to not feel the same way back and forth.
136160	140040	I'm not saying that people ship is invalid.
140040	144820	I'm not saying that you can't see what you want to see in it, because that's the beauty
144820	145920	of fandom.
145920	147240	There's room for everything.
147240	148800	Or art in general.
148800	150720	Art is interpreted a lot.
150720	151720	Right.
151720	152720	Right.
152720	157040	Well, and now me being pretty much autistic, I have to go with what's literally in front
157040	161160	of me because subtext is kind of lost.
161160	170200	But the thing that I will say about it is that I think for the people who are angry
170200	173640	by it, I know why you're angry.
173640	175320	I'm trying not to be spoilery, by the way.
175320	178000	I totally understand, yeah.
178000	180420	For the people who are happy about it, be happy.
180420	187700	I'm just saying that while a healthy debate is fine, it's like religion don't inflict
187700	190520	it on somebody else if they don't want to see it.
191520	196920	Don't try to convince someone to believe something that you do and throw in ad hominem attacks
196920	200200	at them just because they don't see it the way that you do.
200200	202120	Well, there's still two more episodes left.
202120	204280	So it'll be interesting to see what kind of...
204280	209680	I have to admit, I've not really followed the show, but with all this kind of dialogue
209680	214040	going on online, I'm curious to see what ends up happening because a lot can happen in two
214040	215480	hours of TV.
215480	218240	Take the Twin Peaks finale, which was a big thing that I was into.
218240	221280	The first hour, it was like, okay, they're kind of actually resolving everything.
221280	224500	And then the second hour was like, LOL, nope.
224500	225760	It's just all these new questions.
225760	226760	Yeah, for sure.
226760	231760	Well, in this case, judging by what I know of how they write and the things that are
231760	237600	going on for the next two episodes, I think this is pretty much leaving it at this.
237600	238600	So yeah.
238600	246160	I'm sure there'll be something made on it, but maybe we'll find out next episode what
246160	262240	the other side is, but I kind of feel like I've lost some representation as an asexual
262240	263480	person.
263480	269000	ZenMonkey71 in chat over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network asked, what show are they talking
269000	270000	about?
270000	271000	It's Supernatural.
271000	276000	It's a show on the CW network, which has been on 15 years.
276480	279680	It's weird to think that show has been on almost as long as we have.
279680	280680	Almost.
280680	284960	And I'll tell Brad Podculture in chat right now, no, we won't.
284960	289080	That was confirmed the last filmed episode, the last film scene with him in it.
289080	290080	Interesting.
290080	291080	All right.
291080	294840	So yeah, we won't see the character again in this run.
294840	295840	All right.
295840	298800	We got to get to video games, and I've also got to introduce Techmaster Loki.
298800	299800	Hi, Loki.
299800	300800	How are you?
300800	302800	Hi, I am tired.
302800	303800	Tired?
303800	304800	Yes.
304800	306800	I drove six hours from Tahoe today.
306800	307800	Oh, my.
307800	309800	Oh, because it was snowing.
309800	310800	That's right.
310800	311800	Oh, God.
311800	312800	Poor thing.
312800	314800	What were you doing up in Tahoe?
314800	316800	Just family vacation type of thing?
316800	317800	Yeah.
317800	318800	OK.
318800	319800	Well, I hope you had a good time up there.
319800	321800	Drive home outside of that.
321800	324800	Yeah, it was all right.
324800	325800	It's OK.
325800	330800	Well, I do notice speaking of games, I noticed behind you tonight, you're very obviously
331800	334800	paying tribute to Alex Trebek, who I'm sure many of you know.
334800	337800	We lost, unfortunately, today at the age of 80.
337800	340800	We all know he was dealing with pancreatic cancer.
340800	345800	And I think I think many of us were kind of thinking because he was still hosting and
345800	348800	doing everything that he probably still had a bit of time left.
348800	351800	But unfortunately, that was a real kick in the butt this morning.
351800	357800	And what a what a game show legend, an icon and just cool dude.
357800	359800	Really is sad.
359800	360800	Just sad to see him go.
360800	365800	But you do kind of show the I think is that the Sega CD version of Jeopardy?
365800	366800	I think it is.
366800	368800	And I think for Nintendo, it was a Super Nintendo one.
368800	369800	OK, OK.
369800	372800	Because I know he loaned his likeness to pretty much all those games.
372800	374800	He did some voiceovers for some of them, too.
374800	378800	So, yeah, there are there are some some voice clips in there as well.
378800	379800	Yeah, that's right.
379800	380800	There's no one did have some clips in it.
380800	381800	Yeah.
381800	382800	Pretty cool.
382800	383800	Fun.
383800	384800	All right.
384800	387800	Let's get into some gaming news, because it is a big week.
387800	395800	We are on the eve of something that has only happened really twice in the 18 year history
395800	400800	of this show, and that is the launch of a new generation of gaming consoles.
400800	403800	Now, you know, there's it's not always a clean break.
403800	406800	Obviously, the switch came out a couple of years ago.
406800	410800	We were here the day the PlayStation three and the we launched the same day.
410800	412800	But remember, the 360 kind of came out a year before.
412800	414800	But that was all kind of a new generation of games.
414800	418800	And then, of course, we were here when the PlayStation four and the Xbox one came out.
418800	420800	And that was kind of a generation of games.
420800	427800	And now here we are the the night before, you know, figuratively, the PlayStation five
427800	433800	and the Xbox Series X or S, depending on how you want to go with it, which is the first
433800	440800	kind of interesting thing about this particular generation of games is that you have multiple
440800	442800	skews, I guess.
442800	444800	I know that term gets overused.
444800	446800	That's not really true, though.
446800	448800	OK, I know.
448800	452800	You're not let me finish, because I know in other generations we've had like the the 40
452800	458800	gigs or the 80 gigs and there are you know, there's there's been different ways they bundle
458800	460800	it, like there might be an accessory or there might be a game.
460800	465800	But, you know, this this is a pretty to me, it seems like a pretty radical difference,
465800	466800	especially between the X and the S.
466800	470800	That's really what I want to call attention to is that you have two really different consoles
470800	472800	with the X and the S for sure.
472800	477800	And then even with the PlayStation five, you have that digital and non digital, you know,
477800	478800	a more typical format.
478800	485800	To me, that feels very different than what we faced in other console generation launches.
485800	488800	But go ahead with your thought now that I have all that out.
488800	493800	I mean, I guess I mean, hardware wise, usually the systems are pretty much identical, aside
493800	500800	from a few things like I know with the PlayStation three, you know, you had a 20 gig system with
500800	505800	no Wi-Fi built in and then you had a 60 gig system that did have Wi-Fi built in.
505800	511800	And then, you know, with the Xbox 360, of course, there was the one with a hard drive,
511800	516800	one without a hard drive, but essentially they were the same barring, of course, the
516800	519800	Wi-Fi and the PlayStation three can't fix that.
519800	522800	But everything else is pretty much the same.
522800	527800	This is I mean, it's similar to, I guess, the Xbox one and the Xbox one X.
527800	532800	I mean, just a little bit different the way that they're releasing it all at once now.
533800	538800	Yeah, but pretty similar to phones and other, you know, other electronics.
539800	544800	You know, a question I asked on Bobby show that I'm going to ask because you guys know we do tape
544800	549800	live, of course, on Sunday nights at VOG Network and Bobby is on before us and he's very gracious
549800	553800	that he gives a little time at the end of the show every week to talk to me or all of us when we're
553800	558800	when we're in the same studio to a little bit about, you know, some of the hot topics of the week
558800	561800	and something I asked him and I want to ask you guys to get your take on this too.
561800	567800	And you guys in our chat too is, is now the right time to be launching this generation?
567800	574800	Because I have to admit and my take on this is I feel like they should have delayed this to 2021.
574800	579800	And I, I do understand the fiscal perspective of they can't.
579800	583800	They've got to make their investors happy. They're under a lot of pressure to do this.
583800	585800	So they've got to be getting this out the gate now.
585800	590800	But I just I feel like with all the games that have been pushed back and all the you know,
590800	594800	how COVID has just screwed everything up when it comes to not just the distribution,
594800	597800	but the creation of games and being able to get things done in time.
597800	603800	It just feels like I don't want to say that these consoles Nestle necessarily feel half baked.
603800	606800	But the launches, I don't know what it is.
606800	610800	I don't know if it's just because we're not going to be able to line up at a store and get them or whatever.
610800	613800	Something about the launch feels off.
613800	615800	Well, it's a lot of these.
615800	618800	It's a lot of these kind of.
618800	622800	I don't know, like I remember back with the Xbox 360 when that launched,
622800	626800	there was a lot of like great launch games that came out on the Xbox 360.
626800	629800	You know, lots of different games you could play.
629800	635800	Whereas now the stance that everyone's taking of different publishers, you have Microsoft saying,
635800	640800	well, listen, our games are going to be compatible through multiple generations of consoles.
640800	649800	So you're going to have all the new games that are coming out are going to be playable on your Xbox one through the Xbox Series X,
649800	652800	where Sony is kind of doing something similar,
652800	657800	where they're releasing some games on PlayStation four and PlayStation five at the same time, which is not unusual.
657800	661800	Like a lot of different games have come out multiple generations.
661800	669800	But I don't think, you know, we're seeing a lot of like really big exclusive games coming out at launch right now.
669800	675800	And probably a lot has to do with covid and throwing off, you know, development schedules and whatnot.
675800	682800	But isn't it always something that's being delayed because of development schedules even outside of covid?
682800	690800	So I don't think this is necessarily a unique thing with the these new console launches, but.
690800	695800	But I feel that when a game is gold, it should be out already. Just saying.
695800	698800	All right. All right. I'm completely different idea about it.
698800	701800	You please, Jamie, I was just going to go to you. What do you think?
701800	707800	I'm thinking it's our own emotional saturation, that it's hard to be excited about something.
707800	717800	And the fact that we not only are dealing with probably really bad burnout over the covid situation and a lot of us coming off of the election,
717800	728800	either people who are pissing their pants or those of us who finally feel like we've left an abusive relationship and dealing with, I mean, true PTSD over it.
728800	738800	And then there's like this one little thing that is so frivolous in the scope of what's going on around us that it almost seems like it's a joke.
738800	740800	That's that's how I feel about it.
740800	747800	It seems like I would just say it's interesting because there's a very similar take, but it's almost the completely other end of this in the chat.
747800	751800	And Chad Starzik and Chad or Shane says now is 100 percent the right time.
751800	759800	More people are inside and need things to do. Granted, not a whole lot of games there, but it's going to help keep people sane, stuck in their house.
759800	763800	And Orange Right followed that up, saying people need something to look forward to.
763800	770800	So it's it's interesting because and I, I kind of get that, but I also totally get what you're saying, too.
770800	773800	That's not really the opposite of what I'm talking about, though. OK.
773800	775800	But I was talking about something completely different.
775800	779800	I mean, I do. I do agree that. Yeah, it's great to have something to look forward to.
779800	782800	I think that honestly, it's a good time for it.
782800	787800	But I'm saying emotionally, the excitement.
787800	794800	Is hard to when you've got so many other emotions that are just.
794800	804800	So strong and so, you know, and I'm saying this actually as an autistic person and I'm going to go a little bit actually into some psychology.
804800	812800	OK. There is a state that the mind can enter after too much stimulation called alexithymia, which basically it's.
812800	821800	And for sometimes for us, it can happen without stimulation. But a lot of times it comes from overstimulation where the mind will shut down its emotional centers.
821800	828800	And so you can't be excited if there's so much else going on that there's all this hype about it.
828800	836800	But really, who's going to be excited about going out and buying something when they're on so many other emotional highs and lows?
836800	842800	Do you know what I mean? I do. I do. It's it's.
842800	851800	Yeah, I'm still trying to kind of like. Figure out, like, because, OK, so on one hand, we have it's it's something for people to look forward to.
851800	856800	But then there's also and you can still look forward to it, but then it's like you can also kind of have that message.
856800	861800	I think what you're saying kind of get lost because of all these other stimulations we've just had.
861800	870800	Like we're worked up about the election and maybe we're really excited about that or we're we're excited in a negative way, depending on however you feel about it.
870800	875800	And then with covid, you know, just, you know, knowing people that are getting it or having that fear.
875800	882800	So it's kind of like it's it's it's almost hard to feel that same level of stimulation because the world is not a normal place right now.
882800	887800	Exactly. And I mean, it's probably one of the big reasons why I was never super excited about it anyway,
887800	892800	apart from just, you know, all the other shit I have to play that I haven't played.
892800	898800	It's it's just like. Why?
898800	904800	I'm glad it's coming out. Yippie. It's not a big deal. Yeah, I want you know, new releases happen.
905800	916800	I don't care. I feel like there's a lot of people, maybe a lot more this time around that are kind of in that boat of I acknowledge a new console generation is happening.
916800	921800	And that seems really cool. But you know what? I don't need to be on this boat.
921800	926800	Day one, I'm going to get on this boat a little later on. I think there's a lot of people that feel like that.
926800	930800	And honestly, to some extent, I think that's kind of where I'm at.
930800	940800	Like, I feel like if I didn't have this show and I didn't feel a sense of obligation to really stay on top of, you know, what's going on in gaming and so forth,
940800	951800	I'm not so sure I would have even tried to get the Xbox Series X on launch day just because, you know, again, it's a lot of playing old stuff right now on both fronts.
951800	956800	There's not a lot of new stuff on PlayStation five, even that you can't play on PlayStation four right now.
956800	960800	And of course, we know the Xbox Series X, just everything's getting delayed to next year.
960800	963800	So it's really resting on the strength of its launch catalog.
963800	973800	That being said, I still feel a sense of disappointment that I'm probably not going to get one on Tuesday because I have this situation with Amazon that a lot of you have.
973800	978800	Really, it seems like the vast majority where just no shipping dates are coming out.
978800	982800	And so we're out with my turbo graphics for an age.
982800	986800	Yeah, yeah. So most of us feel like we're just not going to be getting that console on Tuesday at this point.
986800	997800	And we don't really have the option to just walk into a store and pick one up or whatever, because neither PlayStation five or Xbox one are going to be flowing on the retail shelves.
997800	1001800	And they kind of say part of that is an effort to not create these bad situations for COVID.
1001800	1007800	But yeah, I kind of think it's a convenient excuse, I think, to PR.
1007800	1012800	There's a big other factor that people really aren't throwing into consideration as well.
1012800	1023800	And that's dealing with the massive loss of income that people have suffered this year due to COVID-19.
1023800	1031800	We don't have as a country the capital to put out money for frivolous things.
1031800	1036800	I'm going to say it flat out. Video game system is frivolous. It's a want, it's not a need.
1036800	1045800	And when people I was just actually listening to another podcast talking about the statistics of of people who have actually had to go without food to feed their children.
1045800	1052800	Right. And we've got buy this, you know, buy buy this stuff.
1052800	1059800	I I don't know. It doesn't feel right to me. I mean, people. Yeah, people need the distraction. It's good to be excited.
1059800	1065800	It's it'll be nice for people to have something to do, but it just doesn't sit right with me right now.
1065800	1071800	No, I get it. Like and I that's why I'm not going full blown. Like, can I speak to the manager mode on this?
1071800	1078800	Because like I completely recognize that, OK, I'm not getting the console Tuesday, but there's far worse news I could be getting in the world.
1078800	1087800	But it does still feel like that whole like, well, I'll just chalk that up to the list of things that just happened in 2020 because this has just been a shit year.
1087800	1092800	And that one thing I was looking forward to. Yes, I'm not getting that either.
1092800	1099800	You know, it's it it does just feel a little bit like, you know, kick me while I'm down type of thing.
1099800	1103800	But I understand I could be a lot more down than I actually am.
1103800	1112800	So it's but it's there's there's a lot of situations where that comes into play, where it's like you have to recognize that you have it better than a lot of people.
1112800	1117800	But that doesn't mean you can't ever feel like, damn, I wish this had gone my way.
1117800	1123800	You know, your suffering does not invalidate the suffering of others. Yes. It's not a contest.
1123800	1129800	Yes, it's not a contest. It's a good way to put it. If it is, fuck, that's a shitty contest.
1129800	1134800	It's not a contest a person wants to win, is it? Let's see.
1134800	1138800	I'm just trying to get some other comments in chat here about the topic. You guys are really lighten up chat.
1138800	1144800	And I do want to acknowledge, too, I don't usually talk about the the donations and the bits and subs until the end of the show.
1144800	1150800	But I would be remiss not to mention the hype train y'all have going in chat right now, which means you got a lot of people subbing and donating.
1150800	1153800	And I just want to express my thanks for that.
1153800	1159800	And especially when we're sitting here talking about people having problems, making ends meet with everything that's going on.
1159800	1165800	You guys still have the heart to be generous and, you know, help us keep doing this, what we're doing on Sunday night.
1165800	1169800	So I just want to say thank you very, very much for that. I really appreciate it.
1169800	1171800	Anyhow, getting to some other comments.
1171800	1177800	DJ Rama S says Best Buy is sending out emails to people to arrange pickup times for their consoles.
1177800	1183800	Yeah, actually. And Shane was telling me about because he's a big, you know, it seems like you can correct me if I'm wrong, Shane,
1183800	1192800	but he seems like he's really team Best Buy and he always kind of gets his stuff at Best Buy and he's really kind of supports them as a store or whatever, which is fine.
1192800	1197800	And he was telling me about that and I was like, damn, that does kind of sound like a really good system.
1197800	1201800	It almost makes me wish I had, you know, got from there instead.
1201800	1208800	But, you know, with most things I get from the old Amazon, it just shows up on my doorstep and that's awfully convenient.
1208800	1212800	And it's never really caused me a big problem till now.
1212800	1216800	I will. I got mine from a Wal-Mart.
1216800	1217800	OK.
1217800	1221800	Because it was the first site that allowed me to actually preorder.
1221800	1230800	And so far with the other thing that I preorder with them, which was Mario Kart Live, it's been zero for one.
1230800	1239800	I have a expected delivery date, which means nothing because I had the same thing with Mario Kart Live.
1239800	1244800	So we'll have to wait and see. It's supposed to be here later than launch day.
1244800	1251800	But I mean, I don't know. I don't understand how it would be on backorder because like I was literally there the second that it went live.
1251800	1257800	Like. It's got to be within the first batch. I mean, yeah, I thought I had it for Xbox, too.
1257800	1264800	I thought I I think thinking back on that day, I thought I got the Series X preordered before the Wario 64 tweet went out.
1264800	1269800	So I thought I was in the early batch, but I guess maybe not.
1270800	1273800	We'll see. I mean, allocations change. Who knows?
1273800	1281800	Yeah. Let's see. Looking at some other. So Akuma JP in chat is saying totally opposite here in Japan.
1281800	1290800	Most of us buy it with our stimulus. Oh, well, you know, if they had ended up doing another stimulus package here in the U.S., which they never got around to doing.
1290800	1295800	But, you know, again, I don't want to get into a political show, but maybe they will. Maybe they won't at this point.
1295800	1301800	But I bet if they had done one this month, there'd be a lot of people using the stimulus to get a video game.
1301800	1309800	I'm I absolutely. And, you know, again, some people may have feelings about if that's an appropriate way to spend a stimulus check.
1309800	1313800	But I also kind of think like, hey, if it's something for your mental health, like I get it.
1313800	1320800	Like, I had I ain't gonna tell somebody how to spend their money. That's that's that's a relationship between a person and their money.
1320800	1325800	That's that's a that's a that's a relationship I do not want to be the third wheel in.
1325800	1331800	Let's see. S2100 Matt says, I think I missed a lot of the social energy that I lost from in-person stuff with my co-workers.
1331800	1335800	I think due to the loss of that amount of energy just made me lethargic.
1335800	1341800	That's it's it's been it has been that kind of year, hasn't it?
1341800	1350800	DJ Roma says not for nothing. If 2020 didn't turn out to be so shitty, I'd be a lot more vocal about how angry I'd be about not getting an Xbox Series X on Tuesday.
1350800	1354800	Yeah, that's I think it's kind of similar, Rama. Like, sure.
1354800	1359800	I sent a pointed tweet to Amazon, but at the same time, it's a tweet.
1359800	1364800	And I got a copy paste response from somebody that, you know, is assigned to do it.
1364800	1370800	Whatever. It's it does kind of put I think everything that's happened this year does kind of put it in perspective.
1370800	1374800	It's like now I'm just now you got to copy paste response.
1374800	1379800	I did. I did get to copy based responses.
1379800	1383800	Because I felt like being sassy. What? It's Twitter.
1383800	1388800	I got one, too, because I complained about McDonald's french fries not being like great.
1388800	1390800	But you know what? I go, sorry, we we failed.
1390800	1394800	I'm like, OK, well, that doesn't fix the french fries I had a few days ago.
1394800	1403800	I I stand by what I said, though, actually, because and just to be clear, because, you know, again, I can say this without, you know, being a total entitled SOB.
1403800	1409800	And I'm going to explain the difference, because what I'm upset about with Amazon is that I just have a vague message like many of you.
1409800	1413800	Again, I know I'm in the same boat as the vast majority of you that ordered there, too.
1413800	1420800	I have a generic message that says, you know, order has been received and there's nothing about when it's going to ship,
1420800	1427800	when they expect even an estimate, what place in line I am or how long, you know, what the estimate is.
1427800	1431800	That's what really bugs me about it is that it gives me nothing to plan.
1431800	1436800	You know, when I walk into a retail store, at least I can see if there's a line snaking around the block or something.
1436800	1441800	I'm going to be like, oh, crap, maybe I'm not going to get one because I'm too far back in line or it's going to be a two hour wait.
1441800	1445800	I can kind of assess that and decide what I want to do as a result.
1445800	1451800	But Amazon's not letting me have that option by just having this generic, yes, we got your order message.
1451800	1460800	So that is really my complaint is that, you know, I just if you would just tell me you're not getting it on Tuesday, but we estimate you're going to get one in a week.
1460800	1465800	All right, whatever. I can wait a week. We're not going to get one Tuesday, but we estimate you're going to get one within a month.
1465800	1471800	Well, maybe I'm going to shop around some other retail outlets, but if I can't find it, I'll just hang on to that.
1471800	1476800	At least give me a chance to figure out the situation. And that's what's irritating.
1476800	1488800	So let's see. Meeshan Chat says, I feel like not to be a Debbie Downer, but as long as you handle your responsibilities, then it shouldn't matter what you do is said stimulation check or anything in your possession re-money.
1488800	1495800	And that is how I it's not my business. How you spend your money is not your business.
1495800	1501800	Phoenix 7726 says, so is this to do with component shortages or is it something else? I'm not sure.
1501800	1508800	I'm not sure we have a clear answer on that. And that would rest with Sony and Microsoft as to what's going on.
1508800	1518800	I think there is a general assumption that with the way the world is right now. And keep in mind, people can't really move between countries right now.
1518800	1524800	We have a lot and it's been that way for like nine months, like the Canadian border has been closed for like nine months.
1524800	1530800	And that's a border with a lot of countries. Yes, I know there's some exceptions, but let's just say just about every country.
1530800	1542800	OK, so when goods are coming in from places like China and where these things are being assembled, I imagine it's a much slower process.
1542800	1549800	This is what I believe when Intellivision did delay the next year, because remember the Amico was supposed to be out.
1549800	1553800	What was what was their little catchy date? 10, 10, 20. Was it? Yeah, OK.
1553800	1558800	Yeah. So it was supposed to be out 10, 10, 20. And they pushed back to something. One, two, three, four.
1558800	1564800	What what the hell was it like? I don't remember. So they have a catchy new date now. Four, three, two, one.
1564800	1576800	Yeah. So but that that was blamed on the state of the world and the components, you know, and just the trickiness of being able to get all those goods from the factories in right now.
1576800	1585800	So I think we're all assuming that is the problem. But I don't think we've had a clear answer from Sony or Microsoft on what is going on with those supply shortages.
1585800	1589800	So, no, no. All right.
1589800	1595800	And Phoenix 7726 is talking about the isn't there a huge just scroll up three.
1595800	1600800	Oh, isn't there a huge shortage of popular new Nvidia graphics card? Yep. That was an issue, too.
1600800	1606800	Pixel pocket says my s x s x Amazon order says arriving November 19th through 24th.
1606800	1611800	So they are providing some people with that info, but not everyone clearly, which is shitty.
1611800	1616800	Now, see, pixel pockets, when you say that like I'm happy for you and I'm glad you have that.
1616800	1627800	But that actually makes me really concerned now because I am left to assume that if you have that date, they haven't given me a date because it's going to be after that.
1627800	1636800	Like I'm a December person at this point. And again, I want to know, like, if that's the news, then that's the news and I'll deal with it.
1636800	1641800	And I promise I'm not going to chew your head off about it, but just be real with me. You know, that's that's all I want.
1641800	1646800	Anyway. All right. Enough about my problems. Let's move on.
1646800	1655800	I want to talk a little bit about some of the kind of like related things that have to do with PlayStation five and Xbox Series X, because we're getting all these again last minute.
1655800	1660800	Like, oh, it is not going to be baked. The single be ready in time. We didn't finish.
1660800	1671800	What's what's going on? So now if you want to have like a lot of different Call of Duty's installed to your hard drive, well, you might not be able to do that right away.
1671800	1679800	So apparently the PlayStation five expandable SSD storage option is not going to be available at launch.
1679800	1686800	It'll be something that's patched into it. So right now it is useless.
1686800	1697800	It is reserved for a future update, they say. So you can't expand any storage to using that M.2 drive or NVME.
1697800	1704800	Yes, M.2 NVME slot. But I think you can still use USB hard disk storage.
1704800	1711800	It's just it's not going to necessarily be as fast as having that internal storage.
1711800	1718800	I'm not sure if you can use it for everything, but yeah, that kind of sucks because that was something that they were kind of talking about.
1718800	1724800	But I know that was also really convoluted as well, because it was like, well, only certain drives are going to be compatible.
1724800	1733800	And I don't remember if they released the list of those, but I don't know. It's just complicated.
1733800	1739800	But yeah, so that kind of sucked. And then, yeah, as we kind of talked about a little bit before that,
1739800	1747800	the PlayStation five is not coming to retail anytime soon because it is going to be available only online.
1747800	1754800	Though I'm not they say it's for COVID reasons, but probably just supply shortages.
1754800	1759800	So we'll see. Well, but to be fair, the supply shortages could be because of COVID reasons.
1759800	1765800	So true. I mean, yeah, but like any any console launch. So it's not surprising that there's console shortages.
1765800	1770800	So that's why I kind of a little skeptical that, yeah, it could be because of that.
1770800	1775800	But also maybe not necessarily because of that. So wait and see.
1775800	1786800	Bobby talking about some of the space issues in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network saying you cannot play PlayStation five or XSX games from external storage.
1786800	1794800	You can store XSX games on external storage. You can't even store PS5 games on external storage yet.
1794800	1803800	And then a question was asked about what's the base storage. Bobby with with the receipts saying PlayStation five gives you six hundred sixty seven gigs available.
1803800	1812800	X series X has eight hundred and two gigs available. X series S has three sixty four gigs available.
1812800	1817800	But remember, that's because your operating system and all that stuff is on there already.
1817800	1822800	The same thing happens with phones or pretty much any device that.
1822800	1830800	Excuse me, has some type of storage system on it because whatever the electronic device is, its operating system is always going to take up a portion of that.
1830800	1838800	So that makes sense. Yeah. And Phoenix seventy seven twenty six says, oh, shit, maybe they should have started at two terabytes.
1838800	1853800	Yeah, maybe they should have. But at least they do have that capability of having the external storage, even if it's a little bit weird, like you got to copy it over and then bring it in and whatever you got to do to make it work.
1853800	1855800	Internal storage as well.
1856800	1867800	And yes, they both have the their proprietary sort of proprietary SSD drives, which aren't necessarily overpriced, which is nice.
1867800	1876800	It's not like, you know, we're not talking Vita memory cards here, but it's still, you know, two terabyte SSDs are a little bit pricey.
1876800	1884800	They're a couple hundred bucks, but it is an option for you if you feel that that's not going to be adequate space wise.
1884800	1887800	I'm just going to wait and see.
1887800	1891800	OK. And I just want to throw a quick thing out there.
1891800	1897800	So this will be on the podcast as I think we're still going. But I am having some Internet issues here.
1897800	1902800	And Comcast has been going up and down a little bit. Are my co-host still able to hear me?
1902800	1908800	OK. OK, so they stopped moving. So I think what's happening is that my Internet just went down.
1908800	1912800	And unfortunately, this was something that has been an issue here all day.
1912800	1921800	And then I was having a good like six hour run where the Internet was holding steady and it looks like it may have dropped again.
1921800	1927800	So I'm going to see if it came back up real quick and check in with my co-host.
1927800	1934800	OK, so it sounds like they're not there, so I'm just going to pause the recording here and we'll be right back.
1934800	1941800	OK. And we're back. And as I think DarkSakura and Loki were letting you guys know in chat,
1941800	1947800	unfortunately, there have been and I've actually posted a message about this in our discord as well over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
1947800	1953800	Unfortunately, there's just been Internet issues outside of my control that are happening in the area.
1953800	1960800	I thought that all went away this morning because I was able to play a good hour and a half of Final Fantasy 14 earlier and I was watching streams.
1960800	1965800	But unfortunately, it did hit the show. But we're going to try to keep going here from where we left off.
1965800	1971800	So sorry about that, guys. But again, some things are just out of my control.
1971800	1977800	So where did we leave off? We were talking about the PlayStation five and the data storage issues, right?
1977800	1984800	Right. Yeah. So I was saying that, you know, at least with the Xbox Series X and S,
1984800	1989800	they have their official storage solutions, which are decently priced.
1989800	1992800	They're not like, you know, Vita memory cards or anything like that.
1992800	1997800	So there's that option. But that's more of something that I'd wait and see, you know,
1997800	2002800	what the games look like and how much it's using up storage, because I think, you know,
2002800	2007800	with games past just kind of cycle that stuff through. But we'll have to see how that ends up working out.
2007800	2012800	I know there's another Call of Duty right around like literally this week.
2012800	2019800	So that could be a problem if you're playing multiple Call of Duty games. But yeah, we'll have to wait and see.
2019800	2026800	All right. Well, now, as far as our take on the next generation, if I remember correctly from prior episodes,
2026800	2031800	Dark Sakura and her household are not hopping on the bandwagon this week.
2031800	2035800	I think they're waiting on that other retro system instead.
2035800	2040800	Oh, VCS. Well, congratulations. Not that.
2040800	2047800	No, I want the PC Engine one, but still, it doesn't mean we're not going to get one,
2047800	2052800	but quite likely if we get either of them, I'm leaning forward to PS5.
2052800	2056800	OK. And I have opted to go with Xbox Series X,
2056800	2060800	although the Amazon shipping issues may prevent me from getting one this next week.
2060800	2064800	So I may not be able to talk about it on the next episode. And I talked on a prior episode.
2064800	2069800	I don't want to repeat myself too much, but just I will get both consoles eventually.
2069800	2074800	It's just personal finances and situations really only allow for one this year.
2074800	2081800	I have a PlayStation 4 Pro. I have an older Xbox, like from the first when they first detached Kinect.
2081800	2087800	So it just makes a little more sense. It's more of a bump up on the Xbox side than it is on the PlayStation side for now.
2087800	2093800	But I will get PS5 probably next year, certainly when Final Fantasy 16 comes out, because I need that shit.
2093800	2097800	And then, Loki, what about you? You're PlayStation 5 this week, right?
2097800	2099800	No, that's Series X this week.
2099800	2100800	Oh, I thought.
2100800	2107800	I know. I don't have a PlayStation 5. I don't know. I don't really need one.
2107800	2110800	And I never got an Xbox the last generation, so.
2110800	2111800	All right.
2111800	2112800	Perfect.
2112800	2116800	All right. So hopefully we'll hear at least Loki's Xbox story this next week.
2116800	2122800	And one of us will crack and get a PlayStation 5 eventually, and certainly we'll be following everything that's going on.
2122800	2126800	I know Bobby, who's on before us, he's confirmed for PlayStation 5 this week.
2126800	2128800	So I know he'll be giving us some of the details on that.
2128800	2135800	And like many of you, I'll probably be watching lots of streams of people from their PlayStation 5, checking that out.
2135800	2139800	What the hell is this Godfall game? Is that even the name of it?
2139800	2140800	Yeah.
2140800	2143800	It's garbage. It's so terrible looking.
2143800	2147800	Let's see. It'll be out there on Twitch, so we'll finally get some answers there.
2147800	2151800	I'm very curious about the Demon's Souls remake. I want to see what that looks like.
2151800	2155800	And I know my husband is probably curious about that, too.
2155800	2158800	So we'll take a look at that.
2158800	2163800	But in the meantime, and I think there's some of you that are in the same mindset.
2163800	2168800	Even if I don't get Xbox this week, I still have such a huge gaming backlog.
2168800	2172800	And there's so much I can still do with my PC that it's going to be fine.
2172800	2176800	I'll have plenty of games to take my mind off of everything else in the world.
2176800	2180800	All right, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks.
2180800	2185800	Kind of in a related note, how our gaming weeks were and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
2185800	2188800	So DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
2191800	2193800	DarkSakura is currently muted.
2193800	2197800	I keep forgetting that my mute button isn't on my headset anymore because I have a different headset.
2197800	2199800	No worries.
2199800	2204800	It was the usual as Animal Crossing.
2204800	2210800	I picked up Child of Light for Switch, but I haven't really played much of it since I first played it.
2210800	2216800	Just a little pinball. Like I said, this week I've been getting over pneumonia.
2216800	2221800	And I haven't had a lot of energy to play a bunch of stuff, I'll be perfectly honest.
2222800	2228800	I did a little bit of some handheld gaming, just some stuff on my phone.
2228800	2234800	I'm trying to decide if I'm going to keep going on Final Fantasy V because I decided to play that again.
2236800	2240800	Most of the time I just want to play something that I don't have to use my brain for.
2240800	2245800	I just want to turn my brain off and do something mindless.
2245800	2250800	Well, by mindless for me, puzzles and word games are my kind of mindless.
2250800	2256800	Because they're the right kind of stimulation, but I don't have to strategize. Makes sense?
2256800	2262800	No, totally. Like P-Cross is my jam when I just want to chill out.
2262800	2267800	For me it's wordscapes. Totally wordscapes. I've been playing a shitload of this.
2267800	2277800	And I'm quite proud of myself because finally my vocabulary of semi-lude and body functional terms has come in handy for extra points.
2277800	2279800	Alrighty then.
2279800	2289800	Hey, I got to use ul-ner once and I got to use fecund once, even though it wasn't on the thing, I got my bonus points for it.
2289800	2291800	These words sound foul.
2291800	2294800	I think it means fertile.
2294800	2296800	Interesting.
2296800	2300800	Yeah. The word fecundity is a fun word.
2301800	2308800	We'll go back to Dark Soccer for a vocabulary lesson later, but in the meantime, Loki, how was your gaming week?
2308800	2314800	I didn't play a whole ton because I'm still working on my game, so I did work on a little bit this week.
2314800	2318800	You going to give us an ETA yet, or are you going to be all Amazon about this?
2318800	2320800	Soon.
2320800	2322800	Okay, you're going to be blizzard about it.
2322800	2324800	Alright.
2324800	2333800	So yeah, hopefully I'll have something soon to share, but not yet. We'll keep working on it.
2333800	2340800	And then, yeah, I mean, just a little bit of Orna this week, a little bit of Minecraft. That's pretty much it.
2340800	2342800	Nice.
2342800	2351800	Yeah, I've been still enjoying my new TV, which I talked about last week, and just replaying some games on there like Tetris Effect and watching a lot of Twitch streams on there and so forth.
2351800	2356800	Still playing Final Fantasy 14, way, way, way too much of that game, but also way never enough.
2356800	2369800	And then one random game I got into again, which I haven't played in a long time because, you know, I blizzard and I have been fighting for a little while and I'm still, I'm still not really happy with them.
2370800	2381800	But I, I'm getting slowly to that point where I'm like, I might pick up the phone and call and be like, can we just like get together for the night, you know, type of thing with blizzard.
2381800	2392800	So I had my wow adventure, which is already kind of come and gone, but I got back into Diablo 3 randomly this week, which season 21, I mean, it was on my computer anyway, and I'm not paying any money to do it.
2392800	2402800	So, cause I already bought it a long time ago. So I jumped into season 21 just to see, you know, what has changed with this game in the years since I've played it last.
2402800	2412800	And the answer is not a lot, honestly, although they're, they're going with crazy twists for the season now, like this latest season, you basically like build up a meter as you kill monsters.
2412800	2425800	And then like every minute or so, like, depending on how much you've built up on your meter, you do like this ultra powerful attack, like either meteors will rain down from the sky or you'll shoot laser beams from your hands for like a certain amount of time or whatever.
2425800	2435800	So it's kind of interesting. It mixes it up a little bit. And considering how long that game has been around, it's, it's, I guess, pretty impressive. They're still putting little twists on it all this time later.
2435800	2449800	And kind of talking about like that mindless thing. You were talking about Dark Sakura, like honestly, the night that I was playing Diablo 3 a lot was Tuesday to take my mind off of everything else that was going on in the world.
2449800	2464800	And y'all know what I'm talking about. And like for me, that was a really good way to get my brain to just like shut off about everything else going on and just focus on the click clicking orgy because that's what Diablo 3 is.
2464800	2475800	The clicking orgy of killing all the monsters with my, my, my fire spells because I was leveling a wizard and think got it all the way to level like 40 in a night. So, yeah.
2475800	2489800	So, that was, that was my week with Diablo 3, a little bit, and then just other little things here and there. Like, like Loki I've been playing Orna, I got to level 200 in Orna, and, and do you know what happened Loki?
2489800	2500800	I just hit. If you go to the regional leaderboard and the top players in the region, I'm now number 100. So, yay me.
2500800	2515800	Yeah, I apparently don't play enough because I'm still like 180 or something and I still haven't quite gotten, maybe I'm 190. I don't remember. But yeah, I've been just trying to play when I can. I don't play all the time though. So, I'm not leveling very fast.
2515800	2531800	On the top 100 board, I am 100. So, there's that. But I think the regions in Orna are pretty big because I think there's a lot of Bay Area players on that list too. So, I don't think it's like, like Ingress is, is kind of a smaller area. It's just like the Sacramento-ish area.
2531800	2537800	But then when it comes to Orna, I think it's really like almost all of Northern California. So, that's kind of cool, I guess.
2537800	2541800	I need to get higher level so I can capture more areas.
2541800	2550800	Alright, let's get into some other news for the week. So, we'll get into some more PlayStation 5 news, right, Loki?
2550800	2563800	Yes, yes, yes. So, we kind of know that PT wasn't going to be backwards compatible with the PlayStation 5 mainly because it's not available in the marketplace at all. So, how are you going to be able to download it and play it?
2563800	2579800	But on top of that, though, apparently it was available or it was working at one time, but there was no, once again, it was a publisher decision to not have it work, apparently.
2579800	2584800	So, Konami is really hell-bent on you not playing that game.
2584800	2598800	So, to make this clear, because some journalists and influencers and preview deemed people got a PlayStation 5 already, and through that process, some of them learned that they were able to play the PT demo.
2598800	2612800	When word got out about that, access was changed so that you can't play that demo anymore. So, this is not a case of the emulator was incapable of playing it. This is a case of the publisher turned it off.
2612800	2623800	So, but okay, so I'm of two mindsets about this, but I have to ask this question because obviously I follow a lot of, you know, gaming, social media and chat groups and things like that.
2623800	2637800	And one message that I saw come up that I think is a fair question is, what is the big fucking deal? Like, why is this narrative of PT, and I'm completely, you know, kind of embellishing the question a little bit,
2637800	2652800	but why is PT still something that's dominating all of these headlines years later? And what does it matter if it doesn't play on the PlayStation 5? It was never supposed to be a thing that was playable on the PlayStation 5.
2652800	2656800	So, why do we care so damn much?
2657800	2675800	Um, I don't know if we necessarily care that it works or not. It's more of just how petty it is for Konami to just say, Oh, yeah, it does work, but we're going to take an extra step to make sure it really doesn't work. That just that level of pettiness is kind of fascinating.
2675800	2687800	Interesting, because two people in chat also use that word petty to describe it. Very interesting. Questbuster in chat says it's that Konami, a multimillion corporation would spend manpower to do this.
2687800	2700800	Phoenix 7726 says because shitloads of people still want that Silent Hill. I, I hate to break it to you, but you're never going to get that Silent Hill and it's it sucks. Like I know, like, and believe me, I'm right there with you.
2700800	2720800	I really wanted to play that game, but you're not like we're never going to get to play that game. Now we might get to play Kojima does a horror take in a different type of scenario, or you know what, even if Konami, Sony, Kojima, they all sat down at the table and somehow worked out all their shit.
2720800	2734800	I would still argue you're not going to get the same vision that started all those years ago when that PT demo came out. And that is still a very daydreaming type of theory.
2734800	2739800	You could get it if, uh, I don't know, Microsoft bought Konami.
2739800	2751800	Even then it would, you might, you might get a new Silent Hill game, but you're not going to get that game. Um, Dark Soccer? I know, I know Silent Hill is a franchise you've always been a big fan of.
2751800	2759800	Do people get too attached to this PT demo? Like, does it matter that we can't play it on PS5? What's your take?
2759800	2769800	People love what they love, but the company's well within their rights to remove it, to remove the ability. It was supposed to have never been able to still be accessed again, so it doesn't surprise me that this has happened.
2769800	2780800	That being said, maybe it's a little, I mean, clearly I think they have to patch that up for legality reasons. That's my thought.
2780800	2786800	And people are right to be disappointed. You know, how you feel is how you feel. It's valid. It's good.
2786800	2803800	But at the same time, a little bit of logic has to prevail. If they were taking it off the PlayStation Store to begin with, then there has to be a reason for it. And my thought is that it's leading more toward legality.
2803800	2813800	You bring up, sorry, I want to let you finish. I just said it's something that there is no longer an active license to possess. Does that make sense?
2813800	2824800	No, absolutely. Because I was gonna say, I pulled two excellent points that you just brought up here that I don't think a lot of the stories and a lot of the reactions to this are getting into.
2824800	2836800	One of them is that legal element that you're touching on. Because you do have, you know, you have Norman Reedus and his likeness that is in that. You do have Kojima's name when he is no longer an employee of Konami.
2836800	2848800	One has to wonder, is there a legal responsibility they had to turn off that demo because they legally have no rights to those names or likenesses anymore, and it could get them in trouble for them to do nothing.
2849800	2857800	I think at that point, that's very likely, but when they first took PT down, that was fully Konami's decision to do.
2857800	2871800	Right. And that leads me to the second point that you had brought up that I think is spot on is that you said that we were never supposed to be able to play this beyond when Konami took it down originally.
2871800	2882800	It's because of the hacking, backdooring, cracking, modding, you know, all that stuff seen that allowed us to kind of extend this demo's life, whether Konami liked it or not.
2882800	2898800	So that kind of begs the question for me, even though this is the news right now that you can't play it, will the hack crack mod, you know, that community, could they possibly figure out like put a false flag on the game or something so that it reads as something else?
2898800	2913800	I don't know. And make the game playable again on a PlayStation 5. I feel like this is going to be a challenge like getting Doom installed on a toaster.
2913800	2925800	Can I get PT to run on the PlayStation 5 after all? And no matter how you feel about the demo and its relevance anymore, it's just become what we like to call in the industry, a thing.
2925800	2937800	Now, it's a thing. Like being able to continue to play the PT demo, it's a thing. So somebody's going to try to get it to work on the PlayStation 5. Why? Because it's a thing.
2937800	2938800	Because it is.
2938800	2953800	It is. Alright, let's move on. Speaking of the hacking, cracking, modding, and you know fans kind of bending things around to get what they want. This is very interesting because I thought this was going to be gone for good.
2953800	2973800	There was an app that was released on iOS called Stadium. And Stadium was taken down from the App Store because Stadium, which is, if you didn't know, this is an app that basically it allows you to play Google Stadia on your phone, which is not something that Google is yet allowing.
2973800	2997800	And a lot of that ties into the same tricky policy stuff that has been hitting Microsoft. But now we're seeing that companies are finding that, oh, well, if we do a web-based app like Luna is doing a solution like that, it's not a problem because we're effectively going around the store, which was a solution that Apple actually was kind of pointing to in one of those many legal filings.
2997800	3014800	Anyway, I digress a little bit, but that's where this all kind of came from, is that because Google had yet to put something out officially, the fans did it themselves. So Stadium got yanked, but at the time it was because it used public APIs in a manner not prescribed by Apple.
3014800	3028800	But apparently a solution has now been found to that problem. I'm not going to get into it right now because it's a little bit technical. What you need to know is that Stadium 1.2 is out and Apple has put the stamp on it.
3028800	3044800	So it will allow you to run Google Stadia on this. Now, it doesn't yet support your Bluetooth controller, and that is part of the change that had to happen to get the approval to go through. But it's still interesting to point out, it works.
3044800	3067800	By the way, Stadium is not just like a Google Stadia device. It is a browser, and this browser allows you access to Stadia. So that is another reason why, because you might be wondering, like, why would Apple let something like that on? Because technically it's just a web browser, and there's nothing wrong with releasing a web browser. It happens to be a web browser that will play Stadia as a convenient little perk.
3067800	3084800	So, interesting, huh? So, I mean, I don't know how much I'm interested in playing games on the phone without a controller, but there might be some games that would lend itself okay to it. I can't think of any, like, it's not going to be Destiny 2.
3084800	3091800	But I just, I find it fascinating that a fan project has beat Google to the punch.
3092800	3099800	Yeah, I mean, that's pretty cool. I could see that there might be some games that'd be worth playing, but then I remember it's Stadia, then no.
3099800	3112800	There's, I'm not going to blame the game developers for a lot of things that Google has botched with the launch of Stadia. There's some fine, decent games on Stadia, plenty of them. But there are...
3112800	3117800	Also that those are plenty of those games are also on all the other consoles.
3117800	3126800	Exactly. It's the Wii U problem. It's that the launch titles are mostly things we've played before, about a year ago.
3126800	3136800	But that's, you know, I do not fault the developers of the game for wanting to make every dollar they can off those games. So it's not their fault. It's Google's.
3136800	3149800	So, but now this is, you know, this fan has potentially enabled the developers to make money, because there's another place they can play the games. So, it's just interesting.
3149800	3164800	Bobby does point out, you know, trying to ground us a little bit here and I do think he's right here. Bobby Blackwell says, developing an app at Google has many other layers of management and code review and other red tape, and a fan can create an app without all that.
3164800	3180800	Yes, that is a fact. But isn't it interesting that we live in a time and age where because of that, a fan can beat Google to their own punch? Sort of. I mean, you know, the Bluetooth controller problem and so forth.
3180800	3190800	But still, look how much press. This is the Stadia headline of the week. It's nothing that Google did. It's something one of their fans did. And I think this is very fascinating.
3190800	3205800	And it makes a strong case for it. Does Google have too damn much red tape? It's just interesting. So, all right, let's move on. We have some other really big news this week, Dark Sakura.
3205800	3224800	Now, I don't know if you know because I think you were off the week that this happened. I banned this game from the show because I was sick of talking about rumors every single damn week. There was some rumor and I said, you know what? I'm done. I'm not bringing this up again until it is officially confirmed. Well, what happened Dark Sakura?
3224800	3226800	Just because you banned it doesn't mean I did.
3227800	3237800	But you conveniently haven't brought it up since that happened. Probably for similar saturation reasons. But it doesn't matter because it's all changing tonight anyway, right?
3237800	3248800	Correct. Well, as we know, yesterday, which was Saturday for us, was N7 Day, which is, of course, a big thing for all the Mass Effect fans.
3248800	3251800	Yes. That's why everybody was dancing at the gas station, right?
3252800	3253800	Girl.
3253800	3267800	And anyway, and for those who are like, who, you know, have been living under a hole and doesn't know how much we love Mass Effect, N7 is the designation of like the elite class of military.
3267800	3268800	Yeah.
3268800	3273800	Like they they make the the Army Rangers and Navy SEALs cry.
3273800	3283800	So anyway, they BioWare released word about the Mass Effect Legendary Edition.
3283800	3286800	We've been griping long enough. They said, here you go.
3286800	3296800	So they've been working for, they say, for months updating the texture, shaders, models, technical features of all three games.
3296800	3308800	And they said they didn't want to remake or reimagine it, but modernize it so that fans and new players can experience it in, quote, its best possible form.
3309800	3320800	This should improve frame rate, better visual enhancements, and it's supposed to be optimized for 4K Ultra HD, which is cool.
3320800	3331800	It says it's going to have every single player based content, all the DLC from all three games, the promo weapons, armors, packs.
3332800	3339800	It will be in spring 2021 for Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC.
3339800	3345800	And they are doing forward compatibility with extra enhancements for Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5.
3347800	3350800	So you know what? It could be good.
3352800	3354800	I am feeling happy about it.
3354800	3359800	My husband's like, is this already like really great on your computer?
3359800	3369800	And I'm like, number one, it looks great on my computer because I downloaded high res mods and extra lighting tools and all of this.
3369800	3374800	So I'm looking forward to see what it looks like.
3374800	3377800	You know, I would like to have hair physics, please.
3377800	3379800	I want the hair to look like good hair.
3379800	3383800	And I can't wait for the modding community after this.
3384800	3389800	I'm happy they finally confirmed it, but isn't it odd?
3389800	3391800	We didn't get a screenshot.
3391800	3395800	That trailer didn't show anything as far as the actual game is concerned.
3395800	3398800	Like, I don't know, maybe those renders of the characters because they did look really good.
3398800	3401800	Maybe they're from the game, but we don't really know.
3401800	3404800	They didn't show any of the actual game in motion.
3404800	3406800	I thought that was a strange choice.
3406800	3408800	The release date, though.
3408800	3411800	I mean, they're half a year away from this.
3413800	3417800	So if anything, you know, I'll be perfectly honest.
3417800	3419800	I kind of want them to sit on it.
3419800	3421800	I want to be surprised by it.
3421800	3427800	I want to look at it and say this was worth the wait.
3427800	3428800	That's my hope.
3428800	3435800	You want to really have that reason to buy it again that your mods didn't do for you, right?
3435800	3440800	Yeah, but at the same time, I'm looking forward to all new and exciting mods.
3440800	3441800	True.
3442800	3446800	Because, you know, the community for this game is going to go,
3446800	3449800	I got a new toy to play with.
3449800	3453800	So happy N7 day to all of our fans.
3453800	3464800	And I briefly revived the Mass Effect tag and made a section for Mass Effect stuff on GenX Geeks.
3464800	3470800	Now, I'm sure a lot of you were wondering out there in Orange Launch Radio Land,
3470800	3472800	and those of you that have been listening to the show for a while anyway,
3472800	3476800	that like to make fun of me because I bought Mass Effect 3 four times.
3476800	3477800	Yes, I did.
3477800	3479800	I bought it on Xbox.
3479800	3481800	Then I got the trilogy on PlayStation.
3481800	3485800	I bought the Wii U version even just because I just, you know, it was cheap, it was on sale.
3485800	3489800	And I got the PC version so I could play multiplayer online with friends.
3489800	3491800	I bought Mass Effect 3 four times.
3491800	3494800	So the question is, am I going to buy it a fifth time?
3494800	3500800	And the answer is hell yes, I'm going to buy it a fifth time through the legendary edition.
3500800	3507800	Although it is a bummer the multiplayer isn't there, but I get it.
3507800	3510800	Like they're focusing on, you know, fixing up the story.
3510800	3515800	It is going to have all the DLC and all of that so you don't have to worry about buying any of that again.
3515800	3522800	And, you know, again, the rumors were saying that Mass Effect 1 was going to be getting quite a tune up under the hood
3522800	3524800	and some of the mechanics.
3524800	3527800	Yes, I'd be very curious to see kind of what happens there.
3527800	3530800	And I think it'll be a good excuse to play through it all again.
3530800	3538800	The other thing with the first Mass Effect is I do believe that it is mechanically different than 2 and 3
3538800	3542800	because 2 and 3 were built around the same structure.
3542800	3549800	And on top of that, the play styles for 2 and 3 are more alike than necessarily it was for the first one.
3549800	3550800	Right.
3550800	3556800	So what I would hope for is that they all get a uniform play method.
3556800	3560800	And honestly, I'm hoping that it's like Dragon Age Inquisition.
3560800	3562800	That would be my hope.
3562800	3564800	Some of the comments in chat.
3564800	3570800	Shad Starzik says, I bought the N7 NZXT PC case they put out yesterday.
3570800	3574800	It was so pretty. I don't know if you saw that, but yeah, that case was pretty.
3574800	3576800	I will say that.
3576800	3579800	I kind of showed that to Alan and I was like, you want that for Christmas?
3579800	3581800	I was like, no, why not? Isn't it pretty?
3581800	3583800	He's like, yeah, it's pretty, but that means I need a new computer to put in it.
3583800	3585800	I'm like, oh, geez.
3585800	3587800	But yeah, it was a pretty computer case.
3587800	3589800	And then the other thing...
3589800	3592800	The thing is that I can make that.
3592800	3598800	My case that I have right now really isn't too far off.
3598800	3602800	And honestly, I like the way mine looks better.
3602800	3604800	And I did it myself.
3604800	3609800	The other thing I want to mention, in that blog post, there was the one screenshot.
3609800	3613800	This is almost more exciting than the trilogy, honestly.
3613800	3616800	Of a new Mass Effect game.
3616800	3621800	So there's also that confirmation that they are going to do another Mass Effect game.
3621800	3627800	Which shouldn't really be a surprise, but Andromeda got kind of a mixed reception.
3627800	3632800	So I think there was a question of how long are they going to keep Mass Effect on ice.
3632800	3637800	Due to the similarly cold reception to Andromeda.
3637800	3639800	And the answer seems to be...
3639800	3641800	It's all in how you look at it.
3641800	3645800	Not long, but these games are going to take years and years to develop.
3645800	3647800	I would say, yay, we got a screenshot.
3647800	3650800	I wouldn't expect this game to be out for three or four more years.
3650800	3652800	It's going to be a while.
3652800	3655800	And it's certainly not going to be Andromeda 2.
3655800	3657800	But we don't know that either.
3657800	3660800	It could be, but I just don't see them doing that.
3660800	3663800	So I'm so curious where the series ends up going.
3663800	3668800	You know what, I'm still pissed off that we never got the Corian DLC.
3668800	3672800	I did end up finally buying the book.
3672800	3674800	Which I haven't read yet.
3674800	3677800	But still...
3677800	3681800	It just makes me want to go back and say, fuck Anthem.
3681800	3682800	Fuck Anthem.
3682800	3683800	Funk at the death.
3683800	3685800	I can't say it again because of words.
3685800	3686800	Words are hard.
3687800	3693800	SHO 100 Matt says, I kind of want to see a round table with Rob, Jamie, and Travis about the Mass Effect remaster.
3693800	3695800	And yeah, I'll be so into that.
3695800	3701800	But when the remaster releases, I kind of feel like there's not a lot to talk about right now.
3701800	3705800	But when we get a lot closer to release and at the release, absolutely, let's have that discussion.
3705800	3707800	Because I know Travis is a big fan.
3707800	3709800	Somebody said you need to invite Shane.
3709800	3712800	Of course, if he wants to join in on that, that would be a fun discussion.
3712800	3714800	So look for that.
3714800	3717800	Spring of next year. Was it spring or was it summer of next year?
3717800	3718800	Spring.
3718800	3720800	That's not too bad.
3720800	3723800	Just in time for my birthday. Hint, hint.
3723800	3725800	Maybe you'll get your wish. Who knows?
3725800	3728800	Alright, let's move on to our next story. Loki.
3728800	3730800	So this is kind of crazy.
3730800	3736800	So of course, Arcade went up putting out all sorts of great arcade reproductions.
3736800	3738800	And now they have their first driving cabinet.
3738800	3740800	So Outrun is the brand new cabinet.
3740800	3743800	It is a sit down racing game.
3743800	3750800	And it's going to include Turbo Outrun, Outrunners, PowerDrift, and of course the original Outrun as well.
3750800	3752800	For $4.99.
3752800	3754800	And they've already got it sold out.
3754800	3756800	But man, that thing looks cool.
3756800	3760800	Although I wish it was Cruisin' or Rush.
3760800	3763800	Not so much a huge Outrun fan.
3763800	3770800	Dude, no. Outrun would absolutely make itself at home in this house.
3770800	3772800	Because Dan fucking loves Outrun.
3772800	3774800	Do you think it will?
3774800	3776800	Because this isn't a theoretical.
3776800	3778800	This cabinet is coming.
3778800	3782800	It's already been sold out, yeah.
3782800	3785800	Well, we'll see.
3785800	3788800	But we still want the pinball too, you know.
3788800	3790800	Yeah, but Arcade went up.
3790800	3792800	It's been having a hell of a year.
3792800	3794800	We can at least agree on that, I think.
3794800	3799800	I'm not sure people were sold on the idea of these replica.
3800800	3802800	I don't want to say full-size arcade cabinets.
3802800	3804800	Because y'all are going to get me on the details.
3804800	3806800	It's like 3 quarters.
3806800	3809800	But when they're sitting on those boxes, it feels pretty full, you know what I mean?
3809800	3811800	So, very close.
3811800	3815800	A darn close experience to the real thing.
3815800	3819800	And yes, I know y'all are going to want to argue about CRTs versus those CVs.
3819800	3821800	Look, just humor me here.
3821800	3824800	They don't make CRTs anymore. What are you going to do?
3824800	3831800	It's a mass-produced experience that's licensed, that's very similar to the real thing.
3831800	3836800	And people weren't sure if these were going to sell or if people were going to pay that kind of money for these things.
3836800	3838800	But look at how far they've come.
3838800	3842800	These machines are making so many of them.
3842800	3847800	And they're something you could just walk up and buy at Costco right now or Walmart and so forth.
3847800	3850800	So they're doing well enough to have that space.
3850800	3858800	And I would really love to have more, but I've talked about why I'm only sticking with the one for now.
3858800	3865800	But, you know, once the place and the time becomes available, would I look into getting more of these Arcade 1UP machines?
3865800	3868800	Absolutely. Excuse me.
3868800	3870800	SSJ100Matt says,
3870800	3877800	The main thing is that Arcade 1UP is innovating so much with these cabs in such a short time, too.
3877800	3878800	PodCulture says,
3878800	3880800	I love my Star Wars cabinet.
3880800	3883800	Bobby Blackwolf pointing out they're making a stand-up version, too.
3883800	3886800	So if you don't want to do the sit-down one, that is an option.
3886800	3891800	That's very similar to Star Wars because I believe Star Wars had a sit-down type of thing, too.
3891800	3894800	Yeah, the thing about the sit-down one is it's very large.
3894800	3898800	I get it that they have that kind of bench sheet that's there.
3898800	3903800	And unlike the Star Wars one, which I guess it is kind of similar to the Star Wars one,
3903800	3912800	but it almost like would seem like it'd be better just to get like a chair and just put it, you know, next to it versus like this giant like.
3912800	3915800	And normally it just it's very large.
3915800	3918800	A chair isn't authentic to what I remember when I was a kid.
3918800	3923800	I understand that. But you know what? It doesn't matter, though, because it's got the pedals, it's got the steering wheel and everything, the shifter.
3923800	3927800	That's enough. I don't need it to have a bench as well.
3928800	3932800	I'm so curious that we talked about a while back, it wasn't necessarily Arcade 1-Up.
3932800	3939800	I remember there was that other company and I can't remember the name that was offering it, but they had a bunch of other Arcade 1-Up ish type things on there.
3939800	3945800	And one of those, of course, was the Jurassic Park arcade game, which can be amazing.
3945800	3951800	I'm just curious. I haven't heard anything about that. I'm on their mailing list. So whenever they do announce something.
3951800	3963800	So let me ask this question. When Arcade 1-Up releases a Dance Dance Revolution machine or a Beatmania 2DX machine, is that when we end OLR because things will have come full circle?
3963800	3969800	Is that, does that mean the circle of life is complete?
3969800	3976800	I mean, I don't think they'll ever do that because I don't think Konami will play ball with that.
3976800	3980800	Have there been any Konami games on these Arcade 1-Up cabinets?
3980800	3981800	Probably not.
3981800	3984800	I'm trying to think through. On the original Ninja Turtles arcade game.
3984800	3988800	Oh, you're right. Ninja Turtles. That's right. Ninja Turtles was.
3988800	3997800	I just don't see them doing that. It wouldn't be weird anyways. It would be kind of like the DDRO hosta or something like that.
3997800	4003800	You know, that really tiny shrunken down cabinet or like, what's the pump it up equivalent?
4003800	4009800	It's like, oh gosh, I saw a picture of it too as someone was playing like a really hard song on it.
4009800	4016800	Was it like a pump and jump or like, I don't remember what it's called anyways.
4016800	4024800	But yeah, that'd be weird though. I can't picture that. I think if you want that kind of thing, you know, dance maniacs that's for you.
4024800	4026800	I mean, but this, I don't know.
4026800	4031800	Jvmon in chat, which I haven't seen that name in a long time. Hello, hello. Welcome back. Good to see you.
4031800	4038800	Jvmon in chat says licensing the music would be a bitch. And that is very true. They would probably have to do some type of special mix.
4038800	4043800	Like if they, if they really. USA mix. Yeah. USA mix too or something or USA mix.
4043800	4054800	Yeah. Conomics. You know, there, there would, they could do something with it, but yeah, it probably would not be a literal release of, you know, a machine like you remember.
4054800	4059800	It would be a customized mix. I just don't think it would sell well. Like if they released one like that. I just don't think it would.
4059800	4074800	Respectfully, I think you're absolutely wrong. I think there are so many people over the years. Think of how many people you've met that have said like, I would get a DDR machine for my house if I had the money or if I had the space, you know, because those machines used to be like thousands of dollars.
4074800	4079800	And if they, if they are able to make them a little smaller and you never know what they might do, they might not have a full stage.
4079800	4090800	It might be a cabinet that comes with like a pad that you roll out or something. I don't know. I just don't hold me to it. I'm just saying don't constrain yourself to what, you know, in the arcade today either.
4090800	4101800	So, you know, they, they could do something and, and I think there'd be a lot of people that would be interested in it because, you know, again, it's that whole case of look at us, we're all in our forties now.
4101800	4106800	And it might be the case of wanting to introduce the next generation to the shit we grew up on.
4106800	4114800	I'll tell you what, here's what they can do then since I think it's unrealistic to put out DDR in like one of these cabinets.
4114800	4118800	I would willing, I'd be willing to accept a bishi boshi cabinet.
4118800	4122800	That could be three quarters scale and just as fun.
4122800	4124800	It just gasped.
4124800	4126800	That would be so rad.
4126800	4128800	All right.
4128800	4144800	Zushi AF in chat says just dance is still popular, an arcade one up DDR could appeal to that crowd. Yeah, I agree. Is that I think there's a, I think there's a lot more people that would buy one of those then then Loki thinks, if I bought a fucking
4144800	4154800	BurgerTime arcade one up machine and no, I do not regret that purchase. If I bought one of those, there's enough people out there that would be willing to buy a DDR arcade one up depending on how to do it.
4154800	4161800	They can hit me up once they put out an arcade one up version of dance rush, but until then, you know, I'm thinking we're good.
4161800	4169800	All right. And I just saw the red light go on. So I think we might have lost the internet again. I don't know. Are my co hosts still there?
4169800	4170800	I'm still here.
4170800	4182800	All right. Okay, that was just a quick blip. Okay, it went green real fast. It was just a quick off and on thing. So sorry, that might have caused a blip in our stream. Again, I'm just dealing with internet issues, but at least that one was fast enough.
4182800	4194800	It was able to bridge the gap pretty quick. You might just got a little skip skip a rue there on the twitch TV stream. Sorry, guys, what can you do? I the internet, it's out of my control.
4194800	4208800	All right, well, let's move on. Let's try to get as much show as we can before Comcast decides to assassinate us. All right, let's talk about Friday the 13th. And that game, which I, I liked the Friday the 13th game.
4208800	4219800	It was kind of one of the first of those like four versus one type of games that I was playing. But it's it's had a rough go. And I think other games have kind of eclipsed it at that point.
4219800	4234800	And I think this is probably the final final curtain. Jason has finally killed us all. And that's because the PlayStation 4, PC and Xbox One versions of Friday the 13th, the dedicated servers are going to be shut down in this month's patch.
4234800	4245800	Now that doesn't mean there's no more multiplayer, but it's going to be peer to peer matchmaking and quick play lobbies. There will still be database servers, but you will no longer play on dedicated game servers.
4245800	4257800	That could cause things would like lag and stuff depending on who you're playing with. So that is kind of a bummer. But this game, this game has had troubles ever since it launched in 2017.
4257800	4271800	They had a license that like went away in 2018. And so they can't do new content for the game. Yeah, so and I think a lot of people moved on to other games like Dead by Daylight, that kind of ended up eclipsing it and so forth.
4271800	4291800	But you know what, I have a lot of memories of watching Extifer and his sister and Flaco Jones play this game on stream. And they were a lot of fun to watch. And so I'm kind of, I'm sad to see that this game, it's not the same isn't dead. But, you know, it's, this isn't a great move for the future of the game, which was already kind of nerfed anyway.
4292800	4313800	SheHulk10 in chat says, Friday the 13th is a great game. Lawsuits caused it not to reach its full potential. Yeah, that's a bummer. But it is hard to look at them, you know, something like Dead by Daylight, which has like every other movie kill. Is Jason in Dead by Daylight? I don't think he is. But I think like every other movie killer I can think of is in that Dead by Daylight game.
4313800	4327800	And yeah, it's a lot like between like Ghostface and all the other stuff that's in Dead by Daylight. All right. Gosh, we might have had a drop again. Unfortunately, are my co hosts still there?
4328800	4338800	Okay, so I've lost my co hosts. So I think this is another big drop. So unfortunately, I'm gonna pause the recording again. Sigh, we will be right back.
4339800	4346800	Okay, and we're back after technical difficulty number two for the evening, and the internet going down.
4346800	4348800	Time to start learning how to use logic, Rob.
4348800	4354800	Well, no, it's, it's not just that, but it's just, you know, the start again, stop again is a pain in the butt.
4354800	4356800	That's what I meant for splicing the episode back together.
4356800	4367800	Oh, it's, it'll be a pain no matter what program I use, because you have to find the points anyway. But it's, it's very frustrating. But what can you do? Thank you for the kind words and chat really appreciate it.
4367800	4378800	But I do want to caution I said going into tonight's show, I've got a three strikes policy. If it happens a third time, we will probably not come back from it. So just a heads up and just alert to Bobby Black Wolf.
4378800	4386800	If you're out there listening tonight, you may need to commandeer the stream if we disappear one more time, we're gonna do our best to get through this as much show as we possibly can tonight.
4386800	4397800	So let's, let's move on. So let's get to our next story. So Jason killed the show when we were talking about his game. We'll get right into our next story. Who's up? Dark Saga.
4398800	4411800	Oh, it would be me, wouldn't it? So that we have our people who are curious about, you know, the the DualSense controller and have decided to play around with it.
4412800	4432800	It looks like the DualSense controller for PS5 is it works with the switch. Twitter user named Broken Games with a Z HDR, connected the DualSense to the console using an adapter. It's the 8bitdo adapter.
4433800	4446800	Or is it 8bitdo? I guess it's 8bitdo. But anyway, the software allow, you know, within it allows them to use the the DualSense controller on it.
4448800	4453800	He was able to switch menus, use, play a little bit of Mario Kart.
4455800	4461800	So it looks like that even though it's not going to work on a PS4, it will work on a switch.
4461800	4470800	It didn't bring up anything, though, about like the haptic feedback or the adaptive triggers. So, so we'll see what else happens.
4470800	4475800	There have been some developers who are trying to get it to work on other systems like PC.
4475800	4484800	Shakedown Hawaii's got a patch that allows people to use the DualSense controller and other accessories.
4484800	4488800	I mean, there's there's like the Pulse 3D headset, media remote, camera.
4488800	4495800	We're going to wait and see how, you know, if anyone's going to be able to make those work with other systems. So there you go.
4495800	4499800	You know, I'm hearing so much positive stuff about the PlayStation 5 controller.
4499800	4505800	And some folks I know that went in on the PlayStation 5 were starting to get some of the accessories, including that controller early.
4505800	4511800	Which is probably what led to the story the Dark Soccer is talking about, is that already people want to try the controller everywhere else.
4512800	4518800	But because there's no PS5 yet, there will be in a couple of days. But I'm really hearing wonderful things about that controller.
4518800	4522800	I know when I was talking to Chad, he was saying great things about it.
4522800	4533800	And some of the blogs and tweets and stuff about playing the new games is that a lot of what feels new about PlayStation 5 in this generation is how they've really changed the feedback.
4533800	4539800	Is that, yeah, sure, the old DualShock controllers had that vibration feature that really changed gaming quite a bit.
4539800	4546800	But, you know, think of your mobile phones. Mobile phones used to only do vibrate. And there was, you know, so much they could do with that.
4546800	4552800	But then they went to that whole haptic feedback and how really different haptic feedback feels in some games.
4552800	4556800	Like, I know like in Ingress when I'm tracing glyphs or something, it does a little bit of that haptic feedback.
4556800	4560800	And it's a really cool kind of mechanism to let me know, like, you know, if I'm doing it right or whatever.
4560800	4562800	And many games adopt this in different ways.
4562800	4569800	And so it sounds like this is a really strong feature of PlayStation 5 is kind of how they're implementing that in that new controller.
4569800	4576800	So I'm not surprised to hear that people want to use that controller in as many places as possible.
4576800	4583800	So, Chad in chat follows up and says, I just realized how techy this week is.
4583800	4589800	PlayStation 5, X-Series X, and iPhone 12 Pro Max. Oof, it's going to be good.
4589800	4596800	Yeah, it's well, I mean, November's usually are pretty techy, though, because, I mean, I don't know if it ever seems like it's all the same week,
4596800	4599800	but it does feel like all the treats are coming out right before Christmas.
4599800	4604800	So, you know, or the holiday season, whatever, Black Friday. So, all right.
4604800	4610800	Anyway, let's get into another story. Loki.
4610800	4615800	Yes. So Sega is selling off its arcade business.
4615800	4621800	Now, not to not to panic anyone, we're not necessarily talking about that, they're going to stop making arcade games.
4621800	4625800	But mainly, oh, my God, you said they're going to stop making arcade games.
4625800	4629800	Yes. Mainly the Sega arcades themselves.
4629800	4635800	So they're selling their arcade business to a company called Genda.
4635800	4642800	And they are involved with arcade game rentals and online crane games.
4642800	4648800	And then they're selling basically an eighty five point one percent stake in Sega Entertainment Co.
4648800	4657800	And they're going to take control of the arcades and their operations starting late December.
4657800	4662800	So that's including 200 Sega arcades across Japan.
4662800	4670800	And then also in Japan, Sega has actually asked some of its employees to retire voluntarily.
4670800	4677800	So they've asked six hundred fifty employees to retire voluntarily with, of course, covid-19 impacting their business.
4677800	4680800	They've called it an extraordinary loss.
4680800	4686800	And since, however, in order to recover earnings at early stage and achieve sustainable growth in the future,
4686800	4699800	we consider that necessary to promote cost reduction centered on fixed expenses and build an even more efficient system and decided to call for a voluntary retirement of employees.
4700800	4709800	So, yeah, that's it kind of sucks that they have to tighten their belts a bit, but hopefully they will make it through it.
4709800	4714800	Sounds like they're in the perfect position to be bought by another company.
4714800	4719800	It's been a lot of the theorizing and stuff on the Internet this week.
4719800	4727800	And there was a kind of a coupling story about how Microsoft is really looking to get their foot in Japan and acquire somebody over there.
4727800	4734800	And I don't know, there's a part of me that's like, hasn't this been like the what the fanboys have been saying for a long time now?
4734800	4740800	It seems weird that an article like that comes out now, but I guess it is the week that Xbox Series X releases.
4740800	4745800	And we've been asking for a while, like, is Microsoft going to try to make this one work in Japan?
4745800	4749800	You know, they didn't work with Xbox, didn't work with Xbox 360, didn't work with Xbox.
4749800	4755800	Is this the time that Microsoft is really going to try for Japan? And is Japan going to take them seriously?
4755800	4763800	They should. I don't know, but there's a lot of stuff that.
4763800	4778800	I really do. I don't know how they're going to get foothold with Japan, but I think starting and bringing on some of these Japanese companies as well, like either a Sega or to a lesser extent, Konami, I think would help.
4778800	4780800	I don't know.
4780800	4785800	Gamer extra first in chat. Hi, extra for all these old faces coming back tonight.
4785800	4790800	I wish we were having tech problems all night. I wish it was a better night for us. But hello, hello.
4790800	4796800	Ask this question chat saying, why does Microsoft seek validation in Japan every console generation? Money.
4796800	4804800	It's money. But actually, they didn't. At least it felt to me they kind of wrote it off with the Xbox one.
4804800	4813800	Like, yes, they tried with 360 when they did like Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey, which were both actually kind of good, especially Lost Odyssey.
4813800	4820800	I don't know why those didn't stick, but they didn't. So but I do feel like they did kind of just let it go with Xbox one.
4820800	4826800	But that might have something to do with the former leadership of the company, too. But I think at the end of the day, it just comes down to money.
4826800	4835800	So, yeah. All right. Let's move on and talk about Steam, another place that people play games.
4835800	4843800	Steam is implementing a feature called play test. And this is going to be a new way that folks can beta test PC games.
4843800	4850800	Now, usually you have to do like demos or key distribution. Like, you know, I've been able to beta test a couple of games on Steam.
4850800	4853800	And usually the developer would have to give me a key to be able to do that.
4853800	4867800	But of course, when you do that, you might you've probably heard these horror stories of people cooking up fake emails and fake representation of YouTube channels and stuff, trying to basically scam their way into getting keys.
4867800	4872800	And it's made a lot of companies very weary about doing that. So maybe there's a better way to do this.
4872800	4875800	Well, Valve has done what's called Steam play test.
4875800	4882800	So what developers do with this, you invite people and control access directly via the Steam store page for their game.
4882800	4891800	So this way, developers can see, oh, this is how many people want to try it out. And we can enable it now for the game and disable it when it's over.
4891800	4896800	Now, this is not a replacement for early access. And Valve did stress that in announcing this.
4896800	4901800	They can actually use both concurrently. But early access is not free to use.
4901800	4907800	This feature will be free to use. And it doesn't go directly to sales or anything.
4907800	4912800	A play test game doesn't have reviews or achievements or anything with the refund policy.
4912800	4916800	So it's all in beta right now itself. But if you are a developer, you could check that out.
4916800	4922800	You can sign up over at Partner.SteamGames.com to try that right now.
4922800	4929800	If you want to see a game that's using this feature to see what it looks like, Total War Elysium is a game that's going through a play test right now.
4929800	4934800	And you can check that out. So kind of a neat way of changing things up on Steam.
4934800	4944800	And I'm not surprised that they're trying to kind of mix that up because I know that key stealing and stuff is a huge problem for developers.
4944800	4955800	And it's a big strain on resources. So I'm surprised they don't just have like a verified list of these are the Steam accounts that are influencers and they release the games that way.
4955800	4959800	And I wonder if this is kind of going to be part of play into that as well.
4959800	4966800	I know this is a little more about like signing up and expressing interest on online forum, but it could be interesting to see how that works out long term.
4966800	4974800	All right. Well, let's take a trip down memory lane to a time when games were not beta test as much.
4974800	4981800	Well, actually, I can't really say the old classic lines that go with the 80s and 90s this week, because tonight we have a classic game that's a little bit newer.
4981800	4982800	It existed even then.
4982800	4984800	What?
4984800	4986800	Beta testing existed then.
4986800	4991800	Well, it did, but not like why we didn't have influencers and it wasn't a wide thing.
4991800	4994800	You know what I mean? It was very it was a lot more narrow.
4994800	4999800	But this game is usually to qualify.
4999800	5006800	And I shouldn't say usually, as always, because tonight's game is no exception to qualify as the classic game of the week.
5006800	5012800	A game has to be at least 10 years old in order to be acknowledged as a classic game of the week.
5012800	5017800	And I'm going to tell you, tonight's game is going to be one of those games where you're going to go, oh, shit, this game's 10 years old.
5017800	5019800	Actually, I think it's 11.
5019800	5021800	I'm old.
5021800	5027800	Actually, no, it's it is just under 11 years old.
5027800	5030800	And the game is Mass Effect 2.
5030800	5032800	I've already done Mass Effect.
5032800	5033800	I may as well do Mass Effect 2, right?
5033800	5035800	How appropriately timed.
5035800	5036800	Yeah.
5036800	5040800	So at any rate, it is an action role playing game.
5040800	5044800	It was developed by BioWare, published by Electronic Arts.
5044800	5052800	It had a release for Windows and Xbox 360 in 2010.
5052800	5058800	So and if I recall correctly, that was January 26, 2010.
5058800	5060800	So less than 11 years.
5060800	5064800	PlayStation 3 had its release in 2011.
5064800	5075800	It basically takes place after, of course, the first game, Durr, and the collectors are out trying to collect people.
5075800	5085800	So you play as Commander Shepard and you have to build your team again and, you know, do little loyalty missions for everything.
5085800	5093800	And then you've got your suicide mission, which is a big part of the mechanics and can be very sad if you don't do it right.
5093800	5099800	So they did change several gameplay elements for this game versus the first one.
5099800	5111800	They put more of the third person shooter aspect as the emphasis, including limiting ammo, having regenerative health.
5112800	5125800	And they wanted to, instead of just forwarding a singular plot, they wanted a plot with optional missions that would be as intense as the main mission.
5125800	5140800	And so they had a composer, Jack Wall, also came back for the soundtrack to give it a darker and more mature sound to go with the evolution of the game.
5140800	5151800	We also had a DLC one called Kasumi Stolen Memory, Overlord, Lair of the Shadow Broker, and Arrival.
5151800	5161800	And I mean, this game is like one of the highest rated games for the systems that came out, but we'll get to a little bit of that in a moment.
5161800	5170800	So basically, you can decide anything you want to about Shepard, I guess, within the standards of when the game came out.
5170800	5180800	So you only had, you know, the binary for gender, but you had amazing voice acting in the form of Mark Meer and Jennifer Hale.
5180800	5183800	Of course, I always play Fen Shep because she was the original.
5184800	5188800	You have different character classes to choose from.
5188800	5194800	You have, each of them have their own proficiency in different sets of abilities, weapons.
5194800	5199800	And then you have like your galaxy map that you go look for quests to do.
5199800	5208800	Thank God they got rid of the fucking mining from the first game and just had it be, you know, something you do from your map screen.
5208800	5212800	I hated the running around and looking for shit like that.
5212800	5218800	Although I do kind of like running around and looking for missions, I guess.
5218800	5224800	So you basically, you have your probe mechanics instead.
5224800	5228800	Combat is squad based and you got to have your squad.
5228800	5237800	You have two squad members that go with you and you have direction control over Shepard and then AI controls your squad mates.
5237800	5244800	So battles are all real time, but you can pause your action, look around things like different powers.
5244800	5253800	It has an over the shoulder perspective, which for me made it really easy to play like that because I didn't get motion sick.
5253800	5258800	Your weapons can overheat if fired continuously.
5258800	5265800	You do have a finite magazine that you have to reload and you've got your shielding.
5265800	5273800	So so we're going to go on to another thing with this one where you have your morality system.
5273800	5278800	It has a radial command menu, meaning, you know, circular ish.
5278800	5283800	And you have your dialog options that appear on the wheel.
5283800	5290800	So left side is typically for items that just continue in-depth conversation.
5290800	5301800	The right side is typically completion and your responses are anywhere between polite and selfless, middle of the road and then aggressive and hostile.
5301800	5311800	So you also do have a context sensitive interrupt where you can interrupt with different types of moral actions with different triggers.
5311800	5315800	Those choices will impact how others react to Shepard.
5315800	5320800	In some cases, you can get discounts, you get romances.
5320800	5333800	And it also affects the way Shepard looks, because if you go more on the paragon side, which is the charm one, then you will your scars from the beginning of the game will heal up and you'll look more human.
5333800	5336800	Renegade, they will glow ugly red.
5336800	5338800	Renegade is your intimidation.
5338800	5350800	And in some cases, you know, the way that you go with that has a bearing on the loyalty of your squad member, which gives them also different abilities.
5350800	5359800	So and then after you've beaten the game, you get a new game plus so that you can basically replay the same character.
5360800	5368800	This is pretty cool. I mean, we've got so many wonderful characters, Garris, that I mean, it's and you could romance Garris in this one.
5368800	5371800	I'm sorry, that's the most important thing about this game.
5373800	5386800	And they also did put a little bit more of a nod toward the Liara romance with Lair of the Shadow Broker, because she wasn't originally a main character for this game.
5386800	5399800	So anyway, like I said, and I just mentioned Lair of the Shadow Broker, you have the different packs that could come out with the different contents.
5399800	5408800	You had the character outfits, different stories with Lair of the Shadow Broker and Arrival, which are actually a major part of the plot.
5409800	5416800	And then the Arrival one actually leads directly into Mass Effect 3.
5416800	5424800	And then, of course, the other ones is the loyalty mission for Zaid, which is the price of revenge.
5424800	5429800	Kasumi stole a memory and Overlord adds five new missions to the game.
5430800	5437800	And they were all just really great. I think the characters have all been wonderfully fleshed out.
5437800	5451800	And one of the things I've enjoyed about this game, just to my heart, has been character development and the true story that you could make it really go in different directions.
5452800	5457800	And then so with this, like I said, this game was very, very well received.
5457800	5465800	For Metacritic, Xbox 360 had 96 of 100 and the other two had 94 of 100.
5465800	5467800	Eurogamer gave it a 10 of 10.
5467800	5473800	Hamitsu for Xbox 360 gave it 36 of 40 and PS3 at 35 of 40.
5474800	5484800	The only site that gave it anything less than a really good score was Game Critics, and we don't care about what they have to say.
5484800	5489800	So they gave it a 7.5 out of 10, so it was still better than average.
5489800	5498800	Seriously, there are many people that consider Mass Effect 2 to be, if not the greatest game of the last decade that it came out,
5499800	5503800	many people consider it the best video game of all time. Like, period.
5503800	5505800	It's Everyone with Empire Strikes Back.
5505800	5506800	Yeah.
5506800	5514800	Now, I will tell you this, I'm a Return of the Jedi person and I actually prefer Mass Effect 3 over this for certain things.
5514800	5523800	Because a lot more Garris romancing goodness and the Citadel stuff.
5523800	5525800	Yeah. 2 and 3 are very similar for me.
5525800	5531800	3 have the multiplayer though, which I don't understand why some parts of the fandom hated that so much.
5531800	5534800	I thought it really enhanced an already strong game.
5534800	5539800	And I'm going to answer Phoenix7726, who says, so no Dragon Age Origins or Mass Effect 2?
5539800	5545800	I don't know what that has to do with what I'm talking about because I'm doing Mass Effect 2 right now.
5545800	5549800	Oh, you mean fleshed out characters?
5549800	5555800	No, I thought that they were, okay, talking about something that has nothing to do with what I'm talking about.
5555800	5564800	So, Mass Effect 2 is a fantastic game and I'm not shitting on it at all. I love Mass Effect 2.
5564800	5571800	But Mass Effect 3 is, I enjoyed it better. I like the story better, I like more Garris time better.
5571800	5578800	But Mass Effect 2 has received numerous Game of the Year awards for soundtrack, for characters, for writing.
5578800	5585800	It won Best Xbox 360 Game and Best RPG at the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards.
5585800	5590800	Oh, okay, so Phoenix was saying, what did I like better?
5590800	5597800	I really don't like playing Dragon Age Origins at all. I love this story. I hate playing it.
5597800	5607800	I hate, hate, hate playing that game. So, Mass Effect 2, I clearly prefer to Dragon Age Origins.
5607800	5611800	Not meaning I hate the game, I love the story, I hate playing it.
5611800	5612800	I get it.
5612800	5621800	And I also hate the lack of interactivity with the main character that you just sort of get her voice grunting and not really working with people.
5621800	5627800	It's kind of like the original Mass Effect. It's hard to play, I think, compared to 2 and 3.
5627800	5631800	But the story is still something you've got to get through, you know what I mean?
5631800	5639800	On top of that, honestly, Mass Effect is much easier to play than Dragon Age Origins.
5639800	5645800	I'm going to go ahead and put it there because you could actually, you felt like your character was interacting with other characters.
5645800	5647800	Does that make sense?
5647800	5648800	Yeah.
5648800	5654800	So, at any rate, you know, you have, you know, just so much going on with this.
5654800	5658800	Like I said, it's received so many accolades.
5658800	5663800	You know, it was winning awards through 2011.
5663800	5677800	And so, as far as Mass Effect 2, actually, it's funny because GamesRadar editor Holland Cooper gave it the Empire Strikes Back video games as its nickname.
5677800	5682800	It definitely had more human depth in it. A lot of people love it.
5682800	5692800	And it was listed by several other publications as one of the greatest video games of all time, even as late as 2018.
5692800	5704800	And it was one of the selected 80 titles from the past 40 years to be added in the Art of Video Games exhibit at the Smithsonian.
5704800	5707800	So, there you go.
5707800	5721800	Of course, in 2012, Mass Effect 3 was released where, you know, it picks up with the Reaper invasion where you try to shoot at the Reaper that can't really be shot at or whatever.
5721800	5730800	And so now we, of course, are going into having a well-upgraded re-release.
5730800	5733800	So, there you go. Mass Effect 2.
5733800	5734800	I am.
5734800	5743800	There it is. Your classic game of the week. The one and only Mass Effect 2. Excellent choice, DarkSakura.
5743800	5750800	Although it is, again, it's one of those things where it's like, oh shit, that game's 10 years old.
5750800	5756800	Because I remember when I first played it. Although I came to the series kind of late, so maybe that kind of warps my perception of time, too.
5756800	5760800	I didn't play Mass Effect 2 until Mass Effect 3 had been out for a couple of weeks.
5760800	5764800	And, you know, Shane was like, you got to play this, you got to play this, you got to play this. All right, fine, I'll play it.
5764800	5766800	Oh, wow, it is actually pretty good.
5766800	5768800	Shane is our ultimate enabler.
5768800	5770800	Yeah, the entire trilogy in like a month.
5770800	5772800	It's Shane's mutant power.
5772800	5778800	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, still never played it. I resisted Shane. Well, hang in there.
5778800	5780800	No, I think it's worth playing.
5780800	5784800	Well, the remaster is going to be a great reason to jump in again, for sure.
5784800	5793800	And the focus is off the multiplayer, and you don't have to worry about are they going to have to change an ending or whatever or DLC or any of that, because it'll all be in one.
5793800	5800800	So I will say, you know, I'm just hoping the Legendary Edition doesn't do any other changes that could make the game worse, because you never know.
5800800	5808800	But hopefully if they're just sticking to it's not a remaster or I'm sorry, it's a remaster and not a remake type of thing, then it should be great.
5808800	5810800	So I'm looking forward to it. We'll see.
5811800	5821800	But yeah, and that's an active says I only played the first for an hour. That's the other difficult thing at this point is that obviously, excuse me, if I tell you to play the trilogy, you're going to want to start with one.
5821800	5830800	And it's hard to hear that the better games are two and three for sure. And that one is very different like combat wise and you know, with other stuff.
5830800	5837800	So that's why we're kind of hoping like a lot of the fans of the series are hoping that the Legendary Edition is going to fix some of that.
5837800	5840800	Like obviously, I don't know to what extent I want them to mess with one.
5840800	5848800	But I just hope they make it just a little more like friendlier to kind of really be that first game where many people want to jump in.
5848800	5852800	Because honestly, I'm not going to lie to you, it is kind of difficult to get into.
5852800	5857800	But if you do kind of stick it out and with the story and everything, it's good.
5857800	5860800	And if you're worried about the difficulty of combat, don't be.
5860800	5867800	There's a very easy difficulty mode and like on the easiest setting, the squad mates will like do all the work for you practically.
5867800	5871800	And you can use space magic once in a while and that'll be it.
5871800	5880800	So anyway, so you can also check out the first game on Game Pass.
5880800	5885800	I believe it's still there. I don't know how much longer it'll be there because I imagine they're going to want to pull the original trilogy.
5886800	5892800	Even with, and somebody had brought up in chat, well with EA Play coming to Game Pass, they'll probably do something.
5892800	5898800	But I'm like, well, they're probably going to want to get rid of the original trilogy because they're going to want the Legendary Edition to kind of speak for the series.
5898800	5900800	So we'll see.
5900800	5905800	Bobby kind of elaborates on his experience with Mass Effect in chat saying,
5905800	5913800	I went to a planet. I think it wasn't the planet I was supposed to go to and this big worm came out and ate me multiple times.
5913800	5917800	And I was like, okay, done. I don't see it's been so long since I played the first game now.
5917800	5919800	Unfortunately, I don't know what that experience was.
5919800	5926800	But I also know how that goes when you hit that point in a game where you're like, all right, I'm doing something wrong.
5926800	5930800	So something else shiny, you know, I get it. Been there, done that.
5930800	5939800	So all right. Well, let's move on with some rapid fire news and we'll start with Loki with guest host Stella the cat on his shoulder there.
5939800	5946800	Yeah, let's talk about some delays. Oh, boy. I love those delays.
5946800	5953800	So first off, Control, their next gen upgrade has been delayed to next year.
5953800	5963800	And you remember there was some issue with Control and whether they could possibly give the update out for free or couldn't do that.
5963800	5973800	And it required you to buy a brand new ultimate edition for 40 dollars, even if you own the original copy of the game on Xbox One and had the DLC.
5973800	5977800	You still have to buy the ultimate edition in order to get that upgrade.
5977800	5983800	Well, all that nonsense is being delayed to next year's. Maybe they'll figure it out by then.
5983800	5990800	So that'd be a heavy something, wouldn't it? And to go along with that, though, not necessarily an upgrade,
5990800	5997800	but that game, the medium, which is kind of compared a little bit to this Silent Hill.
5997800	6002800	That's also been delayed to twenty twenty one, which is weird because I thought that game was coming out in twenty twenty one.
6002800	6006800	But apparently it was originally supposed to come in, come out in December 10th.
6006800	6015800	But now is going to be missing that date a little bit. So it's going to be coming out now January 28th.
6015800	6018800	Not too much of a delay, but still a little bit.
6018800	6021800	So we'll have to look forward to that in January.
6021800	6031800	And last but not least, Curbel Space Program two, which I believe there the developer was purchased by Epic Games.
6031800	6037800	That game now is not even coming out until twenty twenty two. Originally the game was.
6037800	6041800	All right. And he was going to finish talking about a delay on Curbel Space two.
6041800	6048800	Unfortunately, that was another drop of the Internet and that looks like that's going to be the third drop for the night.
6048800	6052800	So I think that is where we're unfortunately going to have to end things for tonight.
6052800	6056800	I'm glad we at least got through the classic game because that would have been terrible if we had to like roll that over.
6056800	6060800	But yeah, unfortunately, I'm sitting here by myself with no Internet right now.
6060800	6067800	And Comcast is not wanting to play along and allow our show to finish tonight.
6067800	6072800	And that's just you know, this didn't used to be a problem because we used to be all in the same studio.
6072800	6078800	And so when the Internet would cut out, we could kind of keep going just for the sake of the recording.
6078800	6084800	But now in this twenty twenty world that we live in, unfortunately, I have to rely on discord,
6084800	6089800	just like many of us rely on Zoom and things like that to keep things going.
6089800	6093800	And unfortunately, it has given out.
