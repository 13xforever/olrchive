0	13320	Hello! It's that time of year where I say if you're hearing my voice, it means that
13320	17980	your clock is set appropriately, where appropriately it is 6pm Pacific GMT-8, that is. Either that
17980	21280	or you're listening time shifted, in either case, thank you! It's the calm before the
21280	24600	storm in the year of our misery, and it's about to become exhausting in the home stretch
24600	28180	of the holidays. Don't get whiplash keeping up with the news. Before you turn on Do Not
28180	31940	Disturb and go for a walk, join our hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki as we
31940	35140	discuss the things we have, the things we're getting, the things we're not yet sure about,
35140	37420	starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
37420	45500	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where
45500	53060	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again tonight with episode
53060	61820	number 841 for this November 1st of 2020. My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me live
61820	65580	here on the feed tonight is Techmaster Loki. Hi, Loki!
65580	67920	Hello. How are you doing?
67920	68920	I'm doing fine.
68920	73220	It is good to see you. Sadly, we don't have Dark Sakura just yet. There is some type of
73220	77860	technical difficulty going on on her end with the computer reboot, so I expect her to jump
77860	82920	in here at any moment to join us for the show and we'll get things underway, that's
82920	88300	for sure. In the meantime, before we get into our kickoff topic for tonight, Loki, how's
88300	93700	the game progressing? This big mystery project you've been talking about for weeks and weeks.
93700	98700	I know nothing about it because you're very secretive. You're being a AAA game company
98700	102300	right now and I want to tell people about it. How is that coming along?
102300	106060	I thought about putting my own yellow text out, but I didn't.
106060	109260	Oh yeah, right. Oh yeah, we'll get into that later, that's for sure.
109260	118820	Yeah. No, it's going okay. So this week it's been, it was finalizing the random spawn generator,
118820	128540	which I did, and then hooking up audio, so I did that as well. And yeah, that's been
128540	129980	what I've been working on now.
129980	134140	Are you willing to say an estimated release date or are you afraid it's going to turn
134140	137180	into a situation similar to a cyberpunk?
137180	145700	Well, I can't say anything right now because I can't really go into more details about
145700	152540	that either because that would give stuff away. So I can't say anything because I can't
152540	160180	say any more. That's all I can say. I'm trying to get it. I'm hoping to have it ready this,
160180	167020	hopefully this month or even, you know, definitely this year. I can't, I can't really go into
167020	169660	more details. Sorry. Otherwise it would spoil things.
169660	172780	I'm going to get the details from your kitty, Stella. That's for sure. That's where I'm
172780	173780	going to get the details.
173780	176940	Yeah, she knows I'm on a call. So now it's, now it's time to start screaming at me.
176940	180500	That's okay. I'm expecting Smush to run in here any minute. We do tape live of course
180500	184800	at the voice geeks network, twitch.tv slash a vog network every Sunday night at six o'clock
184800	189180	Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And I'm trying to read
189180	193300	through chat on what's going on. Okay. I'll tell you what's going on. So one of my pals
193300	198820	from, so it was like a year ago on this show, I talked about that, that survivor LARP that
198820	203740	I was playing online that I won. Right. So one of my pals that played that game with
203740	208580	me, Karen, just joined the chat. So shout out to Karen. Karen and I never got to interact
208580	212920	during the game cause we were on like opposite tribes and we even got swapped opposite each
212920	216320	other. So I never really got to interact with Karen, but I've adored her everything I've
216320	220880	learned about her after the game. So, um, what is going on? So I'm looking to chat and
220880	226600	Karen joins and everyone wants to turn it into a discussion about the, the, the term
226600	231380	Karen, uh, that is used to talk about the whole, you know, uh, Kate from John and Kate
231380	235660	plus eight, I want to speak to your manager and all of that stuff. Y'all, y'all, how old
235660	240200	are you? 12? Like I thought we stopped making fun of people over their names. Knock it off.
240200	246160	Shame. Finally. My name is something you don't want to do to a bank so you can let people
246160	251620	live over their names. Good heavens. Good heavens. Where's my shame bell? Ding, ding,
251620	257180	ding, ding, ding. All right. Y'all know better, but I know, no, I know, I know most of the
257180	263220	time y'all are cool and I also know that everybody's just real tense right now cause there's a certain
263220	268860	thing going on in America this Tuesday that has a lot of people on edge and pointed and
268860	274580	with a lot of opinions on everything. So I get it. I get it. I just hope y'all have made
274580	279320	your voting plan. I've been talking about it for weeks and weeks on this program. Yes,
279320	285580	we play video games, but it's important to use those voices in, you know, what the government
285580	289460	gives you the right to do, what the constitution gives you the right to do and vote because
289460	294340	you're damn right. Government can influence what goes on with video games, right? We've
294340	299480	talked about countless issues here on this program, such as remember in California when
299480	305840	they were going to say that GameStop could no longer sell a mature game, but that concept
305840	311940	of what is a mature game was very kind of nebulous as to what that was. That's definitely
311940	317240	a political thing. So yes, politics can impact video games. So I hope y'all have made your
317240	322720	voting plan. Get on that. Just so you know, you know, with the election on Tuesday, if
322720	327840	you're planning to vote by mail, it's, it's kind of too late unless you already did it
327840	331960	in a lot of places. So that's why I told you two weeks ago to get your voting plan
331960	338080	going. But it's not too late to go vote in person. Or at least you can take. Hi, Jamie.
338080	343480	We hear, Jamie, we hear you. Just a moment. Jamie, we hear you. I don't think she hears
343480	350320	us. All right. So, but make sure that you take your ballot in person, if nothing else.
350320	355120	Don't actually drop that in the mail. So, all right. Good. Everybody and everybody in
355120	359640	chat is sharing their plans. Love to see it. Love to see it. Okay, so I think Dark
359640	364520	Sakura joined us. Can you hear me now, Jamie? Nope, she can't. She's, she's having some
364520	368960	issues, I guess. Maybe now. Maybe it'll be better. That's the joy of doing live radio
368960	374480	is that sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. But I see the little webcam loading
374480	377560	in. So hopefully we'll have a Jamie here in a minute. Hi, Dark Sakura. Can you hear us
377560	385600	okay? Okay, something, something weird is going on. But that's all right. All right.
385600	389560	Looking at some comments in chat. Black and Pat says surrendered my mail to early vote
389560	395400	in person. Okay. The break man says I live near the early voting place. It's been busy
395400	400580	every day. I've never seen anything like it. DGRama S says my polling place is three blocks
400580	405100	from my house. I'll be heading over after I eat breakfast. Good. Bobby Blackwell says
405100	409060	I'm going Tuesday. That's fine. If you're willing to do the waiting on the day of that's
409060	416900	that's totally fine. And we have folks not from America voicing their support. Karen,
416900	421380	who I mentioned earlier, says I'm Canadian, but I support you all. And Act Deaf brings
421380	425520	up the fact that I'm Mexican and the same goes for my part. So we appreciate we appreciate
425520	429740	the love from other countries. And we hope you all participate in the similar processes
429740	434660	in your countries if they are afforded to you depending on where you live, whenever
434660	438820	those elections may be. Okay. So we're still waiting for Dark Soccer to join us. Clearly
438820	442660	she's having some technical issues. We're going to try our best to get through those.
442660	447220	For now, I'm going to jump into the kickoff topic. I apologize. The webcam looks a little
447220	451020	weird. I just have to keep switching between when there's one person on Discord and when
451020	454900	there's two. But we're going to try to get into the top of the show here. So and our
454900	460100	kickoff topic. So, Loki, do you want to start us off on a kickoff topic? Because, you know,
460100	465020	we're only like not even two weeks from brand new game console releases. Right. And we have
465020	470840	a week. Yeah. Like just over a week. We have Xbox Series X. We have PlayStation 5 both
470840	479000	coming out in the next couple of weeks. So we have that coming. And we still don't have
479000	483460	all the answers as to how it's necessarily going to work, which is a little bit scary,
483460	489100	I think. Yeah. So. Yeah. So. So. Wait, hold on just one sec. Did Dark Soccer get in OK?
489100	495540	Can you hear us? For some reason, she still can't hear us, even though we see her fine,
495540	499140	so we'll have to figure that out. All right. Well, anyway, why don't you tell us what's
499140	505060	going on, Loki? Yeah. So we're the question's been, you know, especially with these consoles
505060	509740	now supporting backwards compatibility to a certain extent is, well, how much backwards
509740	516900	compatibility are they actually supporting? So with Sony, we're not really sure. They
516900	522300	said most games are backwards compatible. But apparently on Ubisoft, they had a blog
522300	528780	post listing that there are certain compatibility issues or certain games that wouldn't be backwards
528780	534220	compatible on Xbox and PlayStation. It said basically on PlayStation five, all games will
534220	538580	be backwards compatible, except for the following ones. Assassin's Creed Syndicate, Assassin's
538580	543620	Creed Chronicles trilogy pack, Assassin's Creed Chronicles India, Assassin's Creed Chronicles
543620	549580	China, Assassin's Creed Chronicles Russia, Risk, Star Trek, Bridge Crew, Werewolves Within
549580	556780	and Space Junkies. However, they have later retracted that blog post and just to basically
556780	565860	put a generic, you know, we pulled the Ubisoft Connect article and form regarding backwards
565860	570740	compatibility for the time being, as there may be some inaccuracies involved with the
570740	577260	Ubisoft titles that were playable on PlayStation five. So they haven't yet listed which titles
577260	585360	are going to be having issues on there. But I guess we'll have to wait and see. And this
585360	591380	is crazy because, you know, when we saw that list of what games would and would not be
591380	595220	backwards compatible or I should just say would not because it was very short list from
595220	600100	Sony. You know, there were 10 games on it. But with all due respect to the developers,
600100	605460	they were not 10 major games, they were games that people could kind of give or take, I
605460	610180	think. They were not, you know, you had nothing major on that list. But now Ubisoft is coming
610180	614900	out with this list. And I would say Assassin's Creed and those games and many of the games
614900	620180	that Loki made. Those are pretty major games. Now we're having an issue. So it's, it's a
620180	625720	little weird that we're finding all of this out like what not even two weeks to go before
625720	631000	the release of the console. Now, there could be a weird miscommunication. It could be that
631000	636200	maybe Ubisoft doesn't have the most recent development kits or something. Maybe there was
636200	641160	a late addition to the emulator software that Sony's working with. So maybe Ubisoft's been
641160	645960	doing their own tests, and they're not concurrent with Sony. That's kind of what I think is really
645960	650600	happening. I think Ubisoft is playing with one version of the emulator, and Sony's on the other,
650600	654760	at least that's what I hope. Because if it turns out that Sony has been kind of like,
654760	658520	I don't want to say lying to us, but that's what it's sure going to feel like. That's what it's
658520	663000	going to come across like. With the backwards compatibility thing, that is going to leave a
663000	668280	really sour taste in people's mouths. I just want to jump in here because I see Jamie on camera. I
668280	673640	want to know if we have her on the show officially. Hi, Jamie, are you with us? Okay, we don't hear
673640	677480	you. You're muted on Discord. I can see the mute icon. Oh, she's trying to fix it. Okay.
677560	683320	Try now. Hooray! You're here! The headset I'm using now has a kind of weird setup for the mute.
684760	690200	Basically, you know how I was using my work headset before this? I found on one of those
690200	697320	resale sites someone had a better version of my work mic, and I offered him 10 bucks for it,
697320	703000	and I got it for 10 bucks, and it sounds a lot better. Yeah, you sound great. Yeah, well,
703720	710120	the headset sounds great. I don't. Well, okay, I know you've been dealing with a little bit of
710120	714520	sick. Let's finish the Ubisoft topic, and then I'll come to catch up with Dark Sakura, okay?
714520	718280	All right, so I'm just glad you're here, and you made it despite all those tech issues. All right,
719000	722600	so anyway, the Ubisoft thing. So, Loki, what's your takeaway from this? Do you think this is
723400	730520	Sony's lion, or do you think Ubisoft is not testing correctly? What's your read on what's
730600	736600	going on here? I'm curious about you guys in chat too. I don't know what the issue is with it,
736600	740360	but they're not mainline Assassin's Creed games. They were the ones that were out like on the
740360	746280	PlayStation Store or the Xbox original, not original, Xbox Live Arcade stuff.
746280	752280	Those are basically the games that they had. I don't know. I don't really play Assassin's Creed.
752280	758120	I don't think it's a big deal either way. They're minor games. Maybe they're going to release a
758120	763160	different version for them. Maybe they're just working on backwards compatibility and it's not
763160	767720	going to be backwards compatible at launch or something, and maybe they're not willing to say,
767720	774040	oh, it's not going to work at all, maybe just wanting to give a certain date for it. I don't
774040	779480	know. It doesn't really matter. I don't think it's a big deal, but they could be a little bit
779480	786520	more clear about it because I know when we're talking about the other console, it is more clear
786520	791640	on what games that supports and which ones it doesn't. Going to our chat over at twitch.tv
791640	797880	vog network, Fifth Dream says, if your entire reason for being is playing old games or old
797880	802840	Assassin's Creed on a new console, just leave your PlayStation 4 plugged in. You're a small
802840	810200	percentage of zero percentage. Respectfully, I could not disagree more. Go ahead, Loki,
810200	814600	I'll get my content. I get that, but it's a value proposition because basically, say for example,
814600	818280	not everybody's like loaded with money to buy these new consoles. They're expensive.
818280	823160	And maybe the plan was I'm going to trade my old console in, get some money for it or sell it off
823160	827880	and then buy it because I heard that these games are backwards compatible on that console. So I'm
827880	833160	not really losing my library they've purchased online and I can use these console, this new
833160	837800	console to play those games. And maybe you're counting on that because you have some money
837800	842200	invested with this old console. So you can't really afford to keep both of them. Or maybe
842200	846600	you just don't want to have both of them hooked up. It's like, I know, you know, the PlayStation
846600	850280	3 games aren't really supported too well on that console and I don't want to have to hook my
850280	855720	PlayStation 3 back up or PlayStation 2 or whatever the case may be. I only have finite amount of
855720	863080	space around my TV. So I don't know. I get it. I get the argument that, yeah, maybe you could just
863080	869080	keep both plugged in, but it's not the most ideal situation. Right. And here's why I said what I
869080	874120	said about, you know, I really disagree with the comment. I'm sorry. And you're not alone in your
874120	878200	thinking. I've had to kind of respond to this a lot with my take on it. But I think especially
878200	883560	with this generation of games, we have new consoles that are really starting to feel like,
883560	891560	you know, PC or computer type of upgrades where, you know, a lot of the argument is really being
891560	897800	made on this, especially with a lack of launch titles on both sides. I mean, really, I mean,
897800	902040	sure. Okay. You have Miles Morales, which is also on PS4. You have the Demon's Souls remake. And
902040	906920	then on the Xbox side, you have like one or two things, but like, you know, Halo got bumped back.
906920	912600	So, I mean, on both consoles, I'm sorry, you have a relatively lackluster launch. So they're really
912600	920040	trying to make the argument on this is going to make your old games even better. And Sony's been
920040	925080	making that argument from the beginning. Think back to that early reveal when it was first
925080	929880	revealed in that, I think it was a Wired article about the PlayStation 5 and some of the technical
929880	935240	aspects of it. What game were they using to show off the PlayStation 5? They weren't using Demon's
935240	941080	Souls. They were using Spider-Man from the PlayStation 4 and showing how the solid state
941080	947560	drive could improve the loading times and improve the experience of the PlayStation 4. So my point
947560	954600	is, yes, people want to play the old games on the new console because both Sony and Microsoft have
954680	960120	been making the argument the old games will be better in this new experience. And that is what
960120	966920	has sold me on an Xbox Series X for launch day is because, again, I've talked about this on the show
966920	974280	before, I opted into Xbox Series X because my Xbox One is older and I never got into the One X, you
974280	978920	know, the incremental upgrade there. So I really feel like there are going to be a lot of old games
978920	984280	that are going to play a lot better on Series X. I am very much looking forward to revisiting
984280	989880	something like Forza Horizon 4, which is a beautiful racing game. I can't wait to try it
989880	996520	in 4K, 60 frames a second. That's going to be awesome. So that's, you know, to me, when they're
996520	1001880	kind of like making the old generation a part of this new generation, that's why it's like really
1001880	1008680	dicey. I think that, yikes, suddenly these games may not work after all, but you've been saying
1008680	1012920	it's going to be better on PlayStation 5. I don't know if that argument makes sense. So,
1014600	1020040	DarkSakura, what's your take on backwards compatibility? I know, if I'm not mistaking,
1020040	1026920	you and Dan and your household is not opting into the new generation yet, right? No PS5 or Xbox
1026920	1035480	X for you guys, right? Yet? No, we're really not thinking about doing that anytime soon,
1035480	1040600	just because we got shit we don't play already. And you know what? That's totally fair. There's
1040600	1044600	going to be a lot of people that don't upgrade right away, and it doesn't make you guys any less
1044600	1051640	gamers. It's fine. Hell, the way the world is right now, the money thing alone is a barrier
1051640	1057960	for many people, and we all get that. But anyway, let me ask you a hypothetical. If you were going
1057960	1062680	to be looking into PlayStation 5 and that whole thing, how much does the backwards compatibility
1062680	1066440	factor, especially since, you know, DarkSakura, you're kind of the queen of the classic and the
1066440	1071400	retro here on this show, how much does the backwards compatibility stuff weigh in for you?
1075480	1082280	Not really at all, because I mean, I have the systems. I mean, that's the thing. I have the
1082280	1091800	systems. I don't need backwards compatibility. However, thinking in terms of the, I hate to say
1091800	1100600	the average gamer, you know, they may not have that, those older systems, they may not have been
1100600	1107080	a collector or have the capability to keep field systems, maybe traded it in to get the new thing,
1107080	1114040	and they have all this library of old games. So it would make sense that they would want
1115320	1121400	to maximize that for their user base, all of these companies, and of course, Sony themselves,
1121960	1127880	but that's logic. And they think with the bottom line, you know, if they can get people to rebuy
1127880	1135720	things, then that's all better for them. I don't know. I mean, I'm also coming from, I guess,
1135720	1143000	a little bit of an old school thought with that, you know, that if, you know, when we got our
1144120	1150760	Super Nintendos, we didn't expect them to play NES games, did we? When we got our N64,
1150760	1155240	we didn't expect it to play our SNES games. When I got my Dreamcast, I didn't expect it to play
1155240	1161160	Saturn games. So backwards compatibility is a little, it's a lot more of a new concept,
1161160	1169560	I would say, in terms of gaming, that it's a bonus that isn't required to be there.
1169560	1174680	Now the people have come to expect it. Yeah. I mean, I agree with that to an extent,
1174680	1178120	because we did have, even though Nintendo, you're right, Nintendo did set that standard with the
1178520	1183800	TV consoles, they had the opposite standard when it came to the handhelds. Game Boy Advance did
1183800	1188600	play Game Boy games, Game Boy, or excuse me, DS played Advance games, et cetera, et cetera. So,
1188600	1194440	I mean, I get it. It's sometimes there, sometimes not. So it's not totally fair to expect it as a
1194440	1199800	reality, but maybe it's also a sign of, and I don't know, maybe it's a sign of how much PC
1199800	1205240	gaming has started to come in a little bit. And I include Mac, all computers, and phones really
1205240	1211240	with that too, where the backwards compatibility thing isn't even a question because you increment
1211240	1215080	little pieces or you go to a new operating system or whatever, and the old stuff kind of works.
1215080	1217720	So I think it's interesting. Not always.
1217720	1223720	Okay. Yeah. Okay. With some exception. And for example, when they did several rereleases,
1223720	1229800	and I'm not talking about the Windows 3.1 days, I'm talking about just Windows 95 even,
1230760	1234040	you know, going me edition, you know, whatever was past that.
1234680	1237560	No, you're... Sorry. Go ahead.
1238520	1243400	But, you know, more I'd say in like the modern era of say Windows gaming, there are still
1243400	1248200	ones for pre-Windows 7 that will not run without emulation.
1249880	1254520	Fair. Because you're right. There is that whole, it's the 32-bit, 64-bit thing. And that came into
1254520	1259400	play on iOS and I think Android as well. For example, Flappy Bird doesn't play on
1259400	1264760	the newest iPhones because Flappy Bird, you know, the guy stopped making it and he pulled it and
1264760	1271000	it is not 64-bit or whatever it is. So it doesn't work. And that happened with Windows stuff too,
1271000	1275800	is that, you know, the newest Windows will not necessarily play all the old stuff stable.
1275800	1281560	So, okay, fair. You got me there. Although it is interesting where a lot of times the
1282280	1286600	hacking, cracking archivist community, I shouldn't lump all those things in together, but
1287240	1293000	the community that really works to preserve archivism, we'll say, finds these workarounds,
1293000	1298200	right? You can play classic DOS games on archive.org and so forth because people figure
1298200	1304760	out a way to get around it, right? So there is that. Exactly. Let's see. sj100matt says,
1304760	1310840	folks hiked PS1 through 4 backwards compatibility on 5 even though Sony never really said that they
1310840	1318600	were guilty. But I guess maybe after seeing Sony sell PlayStation 1 and 2 games on PlayStation 4
1318600	1324200	and so you knew it worked, you kind of hoped it would be there, but all right, fine. Anyway,
1324200	1327160	let's see. Some other comments on backwards compatibility. It's a nice thing, you know.
1327880	1334760	I'd say it's not entirely a major requirement, you know? But it's nice. I think it's something
1334840	1338680	that they do to keep their user base loyal. That's my thought.
1339480	1343560	no1special77 in chat says, even if you have the older systems, there are folks that want
1343560	1347320	backwards compatibility because they'd rather have one machine that plays both
1347320	1352200	newer and older stuff rather than multiple systems hooked up, which can lead to a cluster fuck of
1352200	1357320	wires. That is me. I would love nothing more. Actually, you know what I think one of the
1357320	1361400	coolest systems ever was? And Dark Soccer did a spotlight on it years ago when there was the
1361400	1367800	classic system of the month, but it was that Panasonic cube that did GameCube and DVDs.
1368360	1373320	So you could, or was it DVDs or something? But so you could have it all in one. So I would love
1373320	1380680	nothing more than like a Play Xbox Switch that does everything. I would love that. I know it's
1380680	1387880	not going to happen, but. Or what was, we have the, oh God, what is it? That player that also
1387960	1395720	plays Sega Genesis games. You know, I still have my tech and BLEAM. Actually,
1395720	1400920	I got all the BLEAM casts. I wonder if like I could get a dollar for it.
1402600	1407960	I don't even know if he could get that. Let's see. Bobby says I have a BLEAM t-shirt still.
1407960	1412360	I have a sticker. Wow. Let's see. Quest Buster says I managed to get a splitter that allowed
1412360	1417000	my Nintendo and Sega consoles to share an RF adapter. It was great, but the back of the TV
1417000	1425720	was like elder God tentacles. And Brakeman says I dream of a future with no cables. It's coming.
1425720	1432440	It's coming because now a lot of the Bluetooth can send a lot of that stuff. Because Alan will
1433000	1439560	watch Twitch on his phone and he beams it to the TV. There's no native Twitch app on the TV. So he
1439560	1444280	watches Twitch from his phone on the TV and he does that through like Bluetooth. So, I mean,
1444280	1450040	I don't know if the... That being said, the item to which you're streaming must also be
1450040	1454760	capable of the same quality of the device you're streaming from. Sure. Oh, yeah, of course. Of
1454760	1461240	course. And I don't know if like lag and everything is like it's one thing for movies and TV. It's
1461240	1465400	another when you're actually playing a game, especially like a music based game or something.
1465400	1471800	Lag. Let's invent a concept like reverse latency and, you know, or inverse latency as Google put
1471800	1478280	out. Okay. So the lag may not allow for it yet, but I would say that technology is absolutely in
1478280	1483880	our lifetimes that we're going to have a game console top of the, excuse me, top of the line
1483880	1488360	that doesn't have wires. Well, it's going to have to plug in. So, well, maybe, no, maybe not. It
1488360	1493880	would just sit on a wireless charging thing or so. Maybe not. I would say within our lifetime.
1493880	1499560	TVs that actually are powered wirelessly. It's very similar to those wireless chargers, but
1499560	1507080	for a longer distance. So it is possible. It's just not entirely feasible yet. That's the only
1507080	1512040	way I charge my phone anymore is wirelessly because I got a dock for my car. My sister gave
1512040	1516600	me a thing she bought and she couldn't use and it was actually perfect for my car. So, and it uses
1516600	1520360	the wireless. You just pop it into the thing and you don't have to plug anything in or whatever.
1520360	1525400	It uses the wireless charging technology. So that way it's very easy to get in and out of there. And
1525400	1529880	then even when I'm charging at home, I just right by the bed, I have a little wireless pad, plop my
1529880	1535480	phone on there and it charges overnight. Perfect. So, I mean, we're getting there. The brake man
1535480	1541800	says, I mean, no wires, not even power cables. It's a future I dream of. Well, maybe not in
1541800	1547160	five years, but I don't know. We'll see. We'll see. Anyway. All right. Any last thoughts on
1547160	1552760	the Ubisoft and the backwards compatibility issue? I hope it's what I theorized a moment
1552760	1557720	ago is that Ubisoft does not have the latest version of the emulator that Sony has. I'm going
1557720	1565080	to really hope it's that and that it's just a miscommunication, but we'll find out in like 10
1565080	1573000	days, right? We'll see. All right. Well, let's move on to a segment called How Was Your Gaming
1573000	1577880	Week? And we'll start off with Dark Sakura. First off, since we had technical difficulties at the
1577880	1581240	top of the show, I didn't really get to catch up with you Dark Sakura, but you mentioned that your
1581240	1587720	voice was kind of iffy. So you've been a little bit under the weather, right? Oh, remember that
1587720	1596760	massive headache I had last week? It was the start of pneumonia. By the way, I am getting a little
1596760	1603880	bit of lag on the line, but we've had some crap going on with our internet this week. So yeah,
1604680	1609480	I went in having that really nasty headache and it hasn't quite gone away. It's just hung out
1609480	1616280	sort of like pressure on the back of my neck and on my head. And I started developing a little bit
1616280	1624200	of a cough and it felt like my sinus infections normally do, and I have chronic sinusitis. So,
1624200	1629800	I mean, that's just saying something. And so I talked to my doctor and I gave her my symptoms
1629800	1635880	and she's one of the few that has accepted that my body temperature dropped after I lost all that
1635880	1645960	weight. My normal is in the 97.4 range. So when I said that I hit regular normal, she's like,
1645960	1654360	that's a fever for you. Okay. And so as it went, she had me have a COVID test, which I'd already
1654360	1658200	had one at work, but I didn't have the results. And I don't know about those mail-in ones,
1659720	1665640	but both of them came back negative. And the one at Kaiser, well, this is my medical provider,
1665960	1673400	they also included the influenza. So I don't have the flu. So yay. But, excuse me.
1674920	1680840	But my symptoms didn't get better. And actually starting yesterday, they got a good bit worse.
1681720	1689720	And I've had to use my asthma inhaler more than I like to. So I called the advice nurse
1690280	1696680	this morning. They booked me in with urgent care video, which is kind of cool that they're doing
1696680	1706280	that. And the lady's like, she was so funny, this doctor, when she looked at like my allergies and
1706280	1710440	the sicknesses that I'd had this year, she flat out said, Jesus Christ, girl.
1710440	1719240	So I was like, right. And, you know, I said, you know, I feel like I've got my cat sitting
1719240	1726920	on my chest except I am vertical. So she's like, oh, yeah. So she she's put me on some stuff,
1726920	1734200	which I'm on prednisone. I'm going to be a bitch this week. Just this week? Just teasing.
1734840	1740520	Just go to your house and cough on me. Well, at least I know it's not, you know,
1740520	1744840	your covid negative, which is weird because you're describing all of these symptoms that
1744840	1750840	really sound like covid. But it's you know, it's not. And she she does want me, however,
1750840	1758040	to stay indoors as much as possible to treat it like covid, because not necessarily that I'm
1758040	1763400	contagious because I am not contagious, but more that it puts me at a higher risk.
1764440	1770200	And I want to say anyway, if you have a cold, if your allergies are really nasty, and I am not
1770200	1775240	saying this, I'm not a doctor, don't don't take this as medical advice, but it has been advised
1775240	1780600	that you take extra precautions when being around other people and consider shelter in place.
1780600	1784360	Yeah. Even if your area doesn't require it. Well, and I remember that was a big thing. Remember
1784360	1788360	when swine flu hit us all at O.L.R.? I gave you swine flu.
1788360	1793000	Yeah. Loki, did you get it or did you somehow did you get swine flu and we all got it? No,
1793000	1794360	so somehow you didn't get it. No, I don't think I did.
1794360	1799000	So, OK, so I don't know if I actually gave you swine flu and if I did, I'm sorry, but it's still
1799000	1805640	funny. It's whatever at this point, you know, I'm I'm still here to tell the tale. So it's one of
1805640	1809560	those things where and the reason why I bring it up is I remember a big thing with that is
1809560	1813880	you really had to protect yourself. And I remember when they pulled me out of work for a week,
1813960	1817480	even though I was feeling fine at that point, like the symptoms were long gone.
1817480	1821480	But it was all about it wasn't about me giving it to other people. It was about secondary
1821480	1826280	complications coming into me because, you know, I was I was teaching classes of 30 adults at the
1826280	1830680	time and you could easily catch something that could have made it a lot worse. So,
1830680	1834600	well, and, you know, I didn't even have any idea that I had it until you got it
1834600	1837720	because you were pretty much the only other person that I had hung around.
1837720	1842120	Yeah. And I don't know where I got it from. I mean, I went to back when they were still open.
1842120	1847480	I went to Sam's, the kosher deli. Yeah, it was years and years ago. So who knows?
1848360	1853240	It was it was just one of those things. And now it's like, because it can stay airborne for so
1853240	1858280	long and they're learning so much more about it. And I say that they should have been paying
1858280	1863880	attention to the mass culture in Japan and other Asian countries because they had the right idea
1863880	1870120	when you're sick, you wear the mask because you don't want to share it. And hey, people at work
1870120	1875240	usually give me weird looks that if I had a cough, I was always wearing a mask, but no one
1875240	1879080	around me would get sick. I thought that would be one of those things like when they talk about the
1879080	1884600	new normal, what it looks like after COVID is over. I thought our culture would kind of adopt
1884600	1888840	that take where like, yes, you wear a mask if you're sick. But now we have this whole problem.
1888840	1893400	And I don't want to go down this path here tonight. But you all know there's the anti-mask
1893400	1897880	movement and that whole thing. Right. So I don't know if that's really going to be there or not,
1897880	1902680	but I don't know. It's going to be interesting. Speaking of COVID though, I will say real fast
1902680	1907320	and I will thank again, you guys know I'm on the last episode of OLR, Shane was here. So I'm sure
1907320	1912200	some of y'all are curious how he is doing. And if he's in chat, please speak up and speak for
1912200	1917160	yourself, sir. But last I talked to him, he's doing a lot better. So that's yay, good news.
1917720	1922040	But he does say some symptoms are still lingering. I think he said it was like, I'm at 85%
1922840	1929480	and the doctor says that some of these symptoms can go on for a long time. Like he might be short
1929480	1937720	that 15% for months, which is really unfortunate. But I believe he has said to me something along
1937720	1942840	the lines of he'd rather have that than a hospital visit. So and I imagine if I had
1942840	1948760	COVID that my take on that would be very, very similar. So interesting take on the mask thing
1948760	1954280	in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network, as Joe and under Matt says, I for sure want to wear a
1954280	1960120	mask at conventions. Act Def says yeah, with the swine flu, it was more about getting worse by
1960120	1965800	catching something else. And I think I've talked about this several years ago. But I actually lost
1965800	1972200	a friend and she was only 24. And I did lose her to swine flu. It was a very different situation
1972200	1978280	from what we're dealing with now with COVID. But she caught it very early. She was in with
1978280	1984200	the whole thing. She was in Vegas for a mutual friend's 21st birthday. And look,
1984200	1988520	y'all know what happens in Vegas on people's 21st birthdays. I don't got to get into detail,
1988520	1993000	but it would be very easy to probably catch something. But what happened to her is that,
1993000	1997560	you know, she had swine flu, she was the first person in the entire county where we live to have
1997560	2002360	it. And then she caught something secondary. And that's what and it was so early on that they
2002360	2005880	didn't really I don't think they knew that that's what was happening. And that's why people were
2005880	2011720	passing. And then by the time she actually passed on the anniversary of this show, June 23rd.
2012840	2017000	So not to be a downer, but it's the reality of the situation. But by the time-
2017000	2018680	I lost friends with COVID.
2018680	2023640	Yeah, yeah. By the time October came around, which I think was the timeframe you and I got it,
2023640	2029800	maybe it was November, October, November, it was like doctors knew what to do. They knew to give
2029800	2033400	out the Tamiflu to prevent a secondary infection. They knew what to do better. And that's what's
2033480	2039720	made this whole COVID thing a little bit scary is that they really still aren't sure how to treat it.
2039720	2045640	And I think some people had a lot of hope when you know who the big one got, you know,
2045640	2050280	COVID and had that whole Regeneron thing. But now they're even saying it just came out this week.
2050280	2055160	Regeneron is probably not like they canceled the trial of that or put it on hold or something.
2055160	2058680	It's probably not what they thought it was. So that's what made that they still don't
2058680	2060760	really know how to treat it. And that's an issue.
2061720	2066200	The thing that people like my mother don't seem to understand is that like,
2066200	2069720	oh, they keep putting out something new every day. Well, that's fucking science.
2069720	2070520	Yeah, that's science.
2071400	2076680	When science finds out that it's wrong, it does the opposite of what all of these anti-massacre
2076680	2083400	people do and actually learns and puts out new evidence and says, hey, we were wrong about this.
2083400	2091320	Stop doing this. Here is the right thing. It's integrity. Science has to have that kind of
2091320	2102040	integrity to be what it is. I mean, it's always changing. I'm trying to think, like 20 years ago,
2102600	2106680	we thought dinosaurs were big lizards and now we know they're giant chickens.
2107400	2115080	Yes. I mean, imagine living in a time frame when you realize, thanks to science, that this whole
2115080	2120600	time the earth is actually round. It's now been signed. Of course, some people still haven't
2120600	2125880	figured that out, I suppose. But for the most part, we all agree the earth is round because
2125880	2130920	science has proven that. Right. So, you know, you're right. Science does change. We find new
2130920	2136280	things, you know, the periodic table of elements. Sometimes we find new elements. It's exciting.
2137160	2142280	I mean, it's certainly not the thing that we had in science class and, you know, back in the day
2142280	2148760	when we were, you know, not before I was so decrepit. All right. Anyway, it's not to be
2148760	2153400	too tangenty, but it happens here on OLR sometimes. Back to gaming weeks. Let's talk
2153400	2156920	about our gaming weeks. Dark soccer. How was your gaming week? Well, of course, there was
2156920	2165160	Animal Crossing, but I did a completely different kind of game. Ooh. Yeah. And hey, if you can talk
2165160	2174200	about Survivor, I can talk about GISH. Shout out to Karen if she's still out there. Yeah. So GISH
2174760	2184760	is the, it stands for the Great International Scavenger Hunt. And it was arranged by Misha
2184760	2191000	Collins, who played Castiel on Supernatural, who is honestly a very decent human being, a really,
2191080	2195720	really good person. I think that show's been on since they thought the earth was flat, right?
2195720	2201720	That show's been on forever. Three episodes left, Rob. Okay. But it's been on forever. I'm not,
2201720	2208840	like, stop making me want to cry. I'm sorry, but it has been on forever. So nice. Even if they're
2208840	2214920	like, we could just keep doing this or we could stop on a high note. So yeah, but at any rate,
2215640	2222760	it's, and this one was a mini hunt. It was just over a weekend, but usually it's over a whole
2222760	2228440	week and you're given a list and they add stuff to the list during the week to just keep challenge
2228440	2236280	going. But you're awarded certain points for certain crafting things, right? So, and now that
2236280	2242120	the thing is over, I can actually show some of the things I worked on. Just real quick, I'm going to
2242200	2249080	step away. I have to deal with a smoosh situation. I'll be right back. Keep talking and move on to
2249080	2256760	Loki if I'm not back in time. All right. So, so basically what I, you know, it's different
2256760	2261320	crafting things. Sometimes it's baking, sometimes it's makeup. A lot of the different things in
2261320	2267400	there are going to be things like charity work. Like one of the things on there that I desperately
2267400	2273000	wanted to do was get my neighbors to contribute food to a food bank so that I could deliver it
2273000	2283080	and do a picture of me delivering it. But I have the Lurgee, so that was out. So, you know,
2284120	2288760	they're like, I have some pictures up here and I'm going to go ahead and link them in the chat room,
2288760	2300280	but it's on my Twitter at DarkSakura, S-A-K-U-R-A. So, one of the challenges was to make a gory
2300280	2308360	pastry so that when you cut it, it oozes blood. And so I made little strawberry hand pies, but
2309240	2316840	I had like a different, what's the word I'm thinking, rehydrated strawberries from
2316840	2321080	freeze-dried strawberries so that they kind of had this gummy texture to it. And I have that
2321080	2329000	seeping out of the little pocket pie. And then another one had to be a villain from a horror
2329000	2337400	movie cutting out coupons at the kitchen table. So I did Sadako. Yeah, you should see the pictures.
2337400	2341160	And I'll put up my other one because I misread that it had to be at the kitchen table. So I had
2341160	2347160	to redo my initial picture, but Dan took one of me in front of a static TV. So that was pretty
2347160	2353400	funny. But yeah, this one I had to do by myself because he wasn't here. So it's one of my black
2353400	2360360	wigs backwards and wearing like the leftovers from my Project Nunway outfit. And then, you know,
2360360	2367960	I had to pull some junk mail out to do it. And then another one was, if you have a friend that
2367960	2373160	lives far away, it's doing it like a cheer up jar for their mental health. And Becky moved
2373160	2379800	really far away for me. I mean, I have a difficult time getting out to see her. So I took these
2379800	2385080	little Maneki Neko cards that I had and put like a different, you know, like, hey, remember to
2385080	2390360	breathe, drink your water. On my picture I have, ugh, is a valid emotion. And another one says,
2390360	2396120	make today your bitch, you're lovely, you lovely hurricane. I added in some chocolate and some of
2396120	2403720	those C's lollipop minis. And there's also another letter in there that's like the open on a really,
2403720	2410200	really terrible day. And since Becky did come over last night, since I wasn't contagious or anything,
2410200	2413480	I was able to give it to her in person. And another one was-
2413480	2415640	I didn't know she moved. You said she moved?
2416520	2418520	Well, yeah, she moved out to Carmichael.
2418520	2419240	Oh, I didn't know that.
2419960	2422280	Yeah. But for me where I am, that's-
2422280	2422760	Yeah.
2422760	2425240	That's just, look, she bought her grandparents' house.
2425240	2425960	Oh, nice. Okay.
2427160	2434600	So the other one, instead of Elf on a Shelf, we did Ghoul on a Stool. And since ghouls look like
2434600	2438840	humans in the supernatural universe, I took one of my ball-jointed dolls and put her in a chair
2438840	2445480	on a stool holding a knife. So, I mean, those are some of the examples. You know, I also wrote a
2445480	2451000	Black Lives Matter haiku. I'll put that up as well. I did it, you know, and I made it look like
2451000	2459400	one of those inspirational quote things. But yeah, it's really good. Like one person did,
2459400	2467000	like, they had this, like, the Gish Mystery House type of thing. And it started off with
2467000	2470520	Misha and his son West at the Winchester Mystery House, you know, doing a flashlight tour
2471320	2474520	with clues. And one of the big clues was, like, another thing that we had to do. And it
2475320	2479000	was, like, using, like, code 13, but then on different lines and everything. It was pretty
2479000	2484520	cool. So someone had to build an expansive mansion in honor of the Winchester Mystery House
2484520	2490760	at a gingerbread. And someone did it. And I was actually on the live call where one of these
2490760	2495640	people presented it. It was absolutely amazing. I mean, it's, like, worth 130 points. The biggest
2495640	2503000	thing that I did was a video of myself casting a spell to revive my inner child that, of course,
2503000	2509720	didn't work because my inner child never died. So it's really good. And, of course, he's also
2510440	2517880	on the board for Random Acts.org. And so they have, like, a fundraiser right now through
2517880	2524120	GoFundMe to change a life. And so, of course, challenges involve donating to that and getting
2524120	2528840	10 other people not in your team to donate to that. I was on a team, by the way, me doing a team
2528840	2537720	effort. Go fig. But it was really good. It felt good to do something. And on top of that, it was
2537720	2546520	all perfectly socially distant friendly. It was little ways for people to be a part of things.
2546520	2553880	Now, when you sign up for it, you have two tiers. There is a $19 tier that's just, you know,
2553880	2559160	do the hunt. You're buying into it. And it's a fundraiser. It's for a good cause.
2560600	2567080	I actually, since this is going to be my first one and I wanted to do something really good,
2567080	2575320	I did the $99 tier. Well, because I also got bonus and reasons. I just have-
2575320	2577560	You don't have to just... It's your money. Spend it how you want.
2578200	2582760	Yeah. But most of the time, I don't have that to do. So it felt really good to do it. And I'm
2582760	2590440	going to get a bunch of goodies in the mail, so whatever. But it was... I got to meet new people.
2590440	2596360	I have two new Facebook buddies out of it. And it's people all over the country and the world,
2596360	2606200	really, who are coming together for a common cause to have fun together and ultimately to be kind.
2607160	2614360	And that to me... And it's something that they've been quoting from Biden is that... And I'm not
2614360	2620600	trying to sway anybody, but in voting, empathy is on the line. The character of the nation is on the
2620600	2630440	line. And if we can start individually, each one of us just doing different little kind things
2630680	2636920	during the day. Even if it's telling a stranger they have a cute shirt.
2637800	2638520	But six feet away.
2639400	2644840	At six feet away, yes. Or like today when I was leaving the pharmacy to get my meds,
2644840	2649320	there was a security guard just sitting by herself kind of forlornly looking out the window. And I
2649320	2653960	stopped across the desk. It was actually a good six foot distance. And I just asked her how she
2653960	2659880	was doing today. Hope she had a great rest of her weekend. And she lit up. And for some people,
2659960	2664760	that's all it takes. If you have an elderly neighbor in your neighborhood,
2665400	2668920	bake cookies and take it to them unless they're diabetic and then bring them chicken.
2670440	2676520	But there's different things that you can do. And I absolutely suggest checking out randomax.org
2676520	2684840	and checking out GISH. I think it's GISH.org, G-I-S-H. But definitely check them out. Run by
2684840	2692120	amazing people. All of them. And it's a lot of fun. And you get to flex your creative muscles.
2692120	2695960	And the community is just really, really supportive and really wonderful. Even if
2695960	2703000	you're on a different team, people who did the hunts in previous years will give you great
2703000	2708520	advice. They're absolutely amazing. And then Animal Crossing. That's my favorite.
2708520	2710520	Of course. Of course. All right. Loki, how about you?
2710520	2713240	And I did play Pirates of the Caribbean pinball finally.
2713240	2714600	Oh, where at?
2714600	2716440	It's pretty at my house.
2716440	2718600	Oh, not lucky. Nice.
2718600	2720120	Dan sold a few tables for it.
2720120	2721880	Ah, OK. Nice.
2721880	2728520	And we just picked up Monster something. I don't think it's one of the Elvira ones.
2728520	2732840	It's like, I think it's Monster Mash or something. So we just got that anyway.
2733400	2735720	All right. We'll move on to Loki. Loki, how was your gaming week?
2737480	2740680	Non-existent, really. Because like I said, I've been working on my game mostly.
2741080	2745960	I played a little bit of Orna, but that's pretty much it was just that.
2747480	2749640	But yeah, I really wish I could tell you what I was working on.
2750280	2753400	Have video already. I can't show you. So I'm sorry.
2753400	2757400	Why not? I'm starting to get on Bobby's side with this. Why not?
2757400	2759080	The only person stopping that is you.
2761000	2762680	That's where you're wrong. So.
2763720	2770360	Oh, OK. Interesting. All right. All right. Well, OK. So you've been working on your game.
2770360	2775240	We're waiting for that. All right. So my gaming week. So a lot of stuff that I usually play,
2775240	2779960	you know, I was I was I was out doing Ingress. I was doing my my cemetery creeping today.
2779960	2785480	And I realized pretty early on today was a bad day to do the portal scanning because oops,
2785480	2793160	today also happens to be Dia de los Muertos. And so the cemetery I went to, because my genius ass
2793160	2797880	picked a Catholic cemetery today, it was very crowded. And so there wasn't a lot of portal
2797880	2802840	scanning to be done, because while I will while I will creep at the cemetery, I'm not going to
2802840	2810120	totally creep at the cemetery. So there's that act. Act is clarifying it is tomorrow and today
2810120	2814520	is the day of all saints. Thank you. I suppose because it is still the weekend here, there's
2814520	2819000	probably a lot of people that are using today. You know what I mean? So that whole thing. So.
2819000	2826360	All right. So let's see. So I did that and I was playing Pokemon Go and I was getting infuriated
2826360	2832440	by a quest line because there's a quest line that you have to get nine nice throws in a row.
2832440	2836440	And you would think that isn't too hard because that's when the circle is full size. Not too bad.
2836440	2843320	It was like, try it, try it, because it's it's because what happens is that the monster will jump
2843320	2848360	or it'll move. And so you thought you had a nice throw and then it gets away. So I complained on
2848360	2855080	Twitter. And what do you know? Complaining on Twitter works. And what I mean is somebody told
2855080	2859880	me how to cheat and it works. And I'm not going to apologize for it because that task was
2859880	2864520	impossible. So y'all want to know how I cheated? OK. Yeah, of course you do. OK, so here's the
2864520	2870040	deal to get nine nice throws in a row. You want to build up a streak on your own like four or five.
2870040	2875400	But here's what you do. Once you get to about five. Tap on the Pokemon, you're going to catch
2876200	2883960	enable airplane mode, make your throw. If you get a nice throw, turn airplane mode off and reconnect.
2883960	2888120	If you don't get a nice throw and you botch it, close the app immediately without turning
2888120	2897320	airplane mode off. It worked. I got my nice throws in a row and I was so mad because I had a streak
2897320	2904200	going. I was on like eight. But what happened is that when I went to swipe to turn, because I do
2904200	2909080	the quick swipe to turn on airplane mode and the whole thing. When I did that swipe, you know what
2909080	2915880	happened? I threw the pokeball instead. It was a floop and I was like motherfucker. And of course,
2915880	2920120	it broke my streak because I wasn't able to turn on airplane mode. I accidentally threw the damn
2920120	2927880	ball. So I was punished for cheating. OK, I was punished once, but then I got it and cheating
2927880	2934680	worked. Yay. All right. So let's see. There was that. And then the other big news in my gaming
2934680	2942360	world. I got my 4K TV on Friday. So I have a brand new TV. And so I was firing up some old
2942360	2948360	games. Although I kind of realized like, OK, on the PlayStation 4 Pro, there actually aren't a ton
2948360	2953640	of 4K games. There's just a sizable amount, but not a ton of stuff that like like not like there's
2953640	2958680	stuff like in there like Call of Duty that I don't really play. But Tetris Effect is in there. So
2958680	2964280	that was the first game I played in 4K was Tetris Effect. And I will say it is it is a lot. It was a
2964920	2971720	sharper. And I think I'm probably noticing the HDR stuff more because the colors are a lot more
2971720	2976280	vibrant than what I remember from before. And it's not and I wouldn't say it's like a huge
2976280	2980200	upgrade. It's not like going from standard definition to high definition. Remember how
2980200	2985400	that all blew our minds the first time? It's not quite that big of an upgrade. But I was I was
2985400	2990760	still pretty I was like, OK, this is cool. And plus, my new TV is five inches bigger.
2991560	2997800	And when it comes to TVs, size is everything like that. Five inches made a big difference.
2997800	3005080	So I was pretty impressed with that. So, yeah. And Bobby Blackwell says, if you have God of War
3005080	3010440	or Horizon Zero Dawn, those are the PS4 Pro showcase games to me. Horizon Zero Dawn is on
3010440	3015560	my list to look at this week. I was like halfway through the game and then I stopped. So I'd
3015560	3019880	probably have to start over because that's just how I play things. But I want to check that one
3019880	3026520	out. But I am really excited for Xbox Series X coming soon, where now everything will be in 4K
3027080	3031880	and the frame rate. And I'm just really looking forward to that. But that caused me to play like,
3031880	3038040	did you know Sonic Mania is in 4K? I actually played that. And yes, in all its great retro
3038040	3046360	pixelated glory, 4K glory. It was cool. And then what else did I play? Velocity 2X. I just randomly
3046360	3053080	came across it. I just wanted to hear the music. So I played the game again. And one other thing I
3053080	3060520	will mention, I don't always like to base my decision of a game off the demo, but it's the
3060520	3065160	second time I'm doing it in less than a month. Because remember I played that Kingdom Hearts
3065160	3070520	Melody of Memories demo and it's not good. I'm sorry. Not sorry. It's not good. Bobby
3070520	3075480	Blackwell does this on his show. He based Ni No Kuni. He did that off that demo. So if Bobby
3075480	3080440	can do it, I can do it. And so there's another game I played this week where I'm like, I don't
3080440	3085800	know if I want to play this based off the demo. And this is really going to surprise you. You guys
3085800	3097640	ready for it? Hyrule Warriors Calamity Age is not great. Sorry about it. It's as good as it
3097640	3103720	would normally be on a, like, it's, it's the dinosaurs. I mean, it's as good as it normally
3103720	3111160	is. My kids love it. It's not like the frame rate is not great. The pop in is really bad.
3111160	3116840	The textures are not like, and it just like, honestly, when I was playing it, I was like,
3116840	3120600	the original was more interesting to me when I was experiencing that for the first time.
3120600	3125080	Yikes. I don't know if that's the limitations of the Switch. The game may not be fully optimized
3125080	3130280	yet either. I don't know. I did appreciate that they're trying to do new things to it. It is very
3130280	3137640	tied into Breath of the Wild and that lore. And it's very, very obvious. I don't think I can
3137640	3146920	justify dropping $60 on it on release. So, uh oh. So, uh, yeah. So in chat, I will be picking
3146920	3151160	it up because as of right now, my son is still playing. He's been playing it for like the last
3151160	3157720	hour or two, um, on TV. So yeah, I'll probably pick it up. You know what? You can disagree with
3157720	3162360	me. That's fine. You know what? I played Ni No Kuni and I liked it. So sometimes we're going
3162360	3166600	to disagree with opinions and you will probably enjoy. There will be many people that will enjoy
3166600	3172280	Hyrule Warriors and disagree with my opinion. I was just not, the demo did not excite me like I
3172280	3177560	thought it would. And to be fair, uh, the whole Dynasty Warriors series has kind of gone down
3177560	3183320	since 9. They've gotten really sloppy and like, it's just all over the place. So I heard the first
3183320	3188120	Hyrule Warriors is pretty good. So I mean, I enjoyed it. I played a lot more of that game
3188120	3193320	than you guys would think. I don't know. Maybe it's just a demo. Maybe it's early. And that's
3193320	3197320	why you would want to be, I would think you'd want to put your first, your best foot forward,
3197320	3205240	but you think it's in Tecmo Koei and they just do whatever they want. But, um, I don't know. Well,
3205240	3209480	I'll probably pick it up either way. My kids don't care. All right. That's fine. You know what? And
3210120	3214840	you know, I liked a lot of crap games when I was a kid too. I still stand by Friday the 13th on NES.
3214840	3221000	It was a good game, dammit. All right. But that's my kid talking. All right. Let's move on. Let's
3221000	3225160	talk about other stuff. That's it for our gaming weeks. I don't really have a lot of like housekeeping
3225160	3230120	or other announcements. No time off for the foreseeable future. No time off for anybody.
3230120	3234360	No, but I mean, you know, the holidays are not on Sundays this year and so forth. I don't know. I
3234360	3239400	don't have any out of town trips planned. Um, cause you know, with the pandemic and all, it's,
3239400	3245080	uh, not something we're doing very often. So there's that. So we'll move on. Let's get into
3245080	3249640	what's going on in the gaming world right now. And we'll start with Loki. Who's going to talk about
3249640	3257080	other Nintendo stuff. Direct. So, uh, we had a direct mini, uh, this week and they talked about
3257080	3264120	some new games coming to the switch and some, uh, mini, uh, announcements here. So of course,
3264120	3268360	one of the things they talked about was the Hyrule warriors, Age of Calamity free demo,
3268360	3274920	which is out now, check it out. Game comes out on the 20th. And, um, one thing that was kind
3274920	3278840	of interesting that they also talked about, which we didn't really get so much over here,
3278840	3284680	but it was definitely a thing that's been in Japan and other regions is cloud streaming.
3284680	3291880	So control is now out on the switch via cloud streaming, uh, assesses Crete Odyssey came out
3291880	3296680	in Japan like that, where you could play the game via cloud streaming because the hardware itself
3296680	3303320	can't really handle running the actual game, but it is interesting to see this being, um,
3303320	3306920	offered for yet another game. I would hope that would seem more kind of come that way.
3307560	3314760	Um, they showed off some more of, um, immortals Phoenix rising, running on the switch. Uh,
3314760	3319960	they talked about bravely default, uh, which is now coming out February 26th,
3319960	3326920	briefly default two, I should say, um, story of seasons is getting a sequel on the switch,
3326920	3333800	a story of seasons, pioneer of pioneers of all of coming out March 23rd. Uh, they talked about
3333800	3339560	no more heroes three, which is going to be coming out sometime, uh, next year. And then also, uh,
3339560	3345000	no more heroes one and two, um, are out now on the switch. So that was kind of a surprise
3345000	3349560	announcement as well. Uh, hit man three is also going to be coming, uh, to the switch
3349560	3357560	also with that cloud streaming. So that's also very interesting. Um, a game made by how laboratory
3357560	3365640	called part-time UFO, which I believe was a port of a mobile game is coming out soon. I think it's
3365640	3372920	already out. And, uh, what else? Uh, Tropico six coming to, uh, the switch getting important for
3372920	3381880	that, uh, uh, surviving it aftermath coming spring 2021. That's also another port. And in Grifflands
3381880	3386920	sometime next summer is when that's coming out. And so, and they said, this is the last one of
3386920	3392280	the year, right? So there's no more, no more announcements for 2020 after this. So, and in fact,
3392280	3398200	a lot of this stuff was for 2021. So, um, that's, that's it. So I got to say Nintendo's holiday
3398840	3403400	is, I mean, we knew this was going to be the case, but Nintendo's holidays looking a little thin.
3403400	3407000	Um, but I don't think that's going to stop the switch from selling. And I think
3408040	3412760	with the pandemic and everything going on, it's a understandable. And B I think they're,
3412760	3416840	they're going to be fine. I think they're still going to sell a ton of switches, just people that
3417800	3421560	extra one or a new one for their household. So they can play animal crossing for the first time
3421560	3425960	or the impressive library of games that switch already has. So I don't think Nintendo is exactly
3425960	3430120	going to struggle, but I think there's a lot of fans that are like, ah, I was hoping for
3430120	3434920	something a little bigger than maybe, you know, a new Hyrule warriors and some Wii U ports. Oh,
3434920	3438600	and a new Pikmin, I guess just came out this week, but that's also not for everybody. Right.
3439320	3444920	So, yeah. Yeah. All right. Um, I mean, Pikmin releases came, they really have, I mean,
3445320	3451720	come on, give, give some of the other series, some love F zero earthbound. All right. Uh,
3451720	3457320	but, uh, I would, I would say that the control thing was pretty surprising in the cloud gaming.
3457320	3462760	Have they, I guess they have done that here in the U S right. One of the resident evils they
3462760	3468520	did on the cloud gaming, didn't they? But yeah, seven, I thought, um, or yeah, seven,
3469160	3474280	didn't they bring it? I thought that was in, I can't remember some are only in Japan and I know
3475080	3479000	that this has been the thing in Japan for a little bit because we were kind of commenting on it that
3479000	3483000	like, oh, that's interesting. And I wonder when they'll bring that over here. Well, here we go.
3483000	3487480	Now we're seeing it with control. Um, okay. So Bobby has confirmed me. This is the first time
3487480	3492760	that the U S has had streaming for switch. So I I'm crossing the wires in my head and I, I gave
3492760	3497560	the resident evil thing, a U S release when we didn't actually have one. Um, but I do want to
3497560	3503400	say, uh, dark Tetsuya was talking about that demo of control saying it's only the first 15 minutes,
3503400	3507560	but it seemed to play just fine, but that's actually really good because that also kind
3507560	3512840	of lets you gauge, is this going to work for me or not? And so you can kind of see if that cloud,
3512840	3517080	as I've actually think that's a really cool, uh, thing that they did to do that demo,
3517080	3522680	to allow you to see is streaming going to work for you. So, so I wonder how far away are we from,
3522680	3530120	uh, X cloud support on the switch. You're not the first to suggest that I, I would be so
3530120	3535160	curious if that is really a thing. I know Microsoft would do it. I know they would,
3535160	3541720	but it would Nintendo. That's the huge question mark. Uh, we'll see, uh, orange right in chat
3541720	3546360	says I did try it out a little bit just to see if it will work on my connection. It did. Uh,
3546360	3550440	they've been doing cloud games in Japan, assassin's creed, one of them, uh, those,
3550440	3554440	that comment again from orange right in our chat over at twitch.tv slash a fog network.
3554440	3558360	So the cloud gaming thing is, is very interesting and you're right. It's, it's going to open the
3558440	3565160	door to other things. I mean, you, you say X cloud, but we could also maybe have Luna
3565160	3573880	on the Nintendo platform. We could have, um, uh, stadia, LOL, maybe, uh, why not tell, tell me,
3573880	3578600	I can think of more reasons why yes than why no, especially from a technical perspective at this
3578600	3584360	point. So we'll see what happens. It'd be very interesting. I'll be curious if Nintendo wants
3584360	3589160	to adopt this streaming thing in their own games. That's what I'm really curious about.
3589800	3594200	We'll see, like offer them on other platforms outside of the switch. No, uh,
3595080	3600360	deliver other technical experiences and other things via cloud-based gaming,
3600360	3606360	like allowing them to push what the system can do even further through the cloud. Perhaps when
3606360	3612200	switch pro becomes a reality that a person with a regular switch could still experience switch pro
3612200	3617640	games. Thanks to the magic of the cloud. I, I it's a tall order from Nintendo who sometimes
3617640	3624280	seems to lag behind, but Nintendo also has this random ability to get these random things right
3624280	3630040	on the money. For example, making a bang up AR game. That's a really impressive show of the
3630040	3636280	technology with that Mario cart game. Who would have thought? It is. Nintendo would do it, but
3637240	3644520	okay. I have a feeling it's going to go the way the lab. Oh, like it. It's fun for awhile. And
3644520	3649480	then you stop playing it. And that's the whole reason I didn't get it. I knew it would be fun
3649480	3655640	for five minutes, but that's it. But, but you have kids. Don't you think the kids will be into it
3655640	3667400	longer? No, they don't want to set it up. So it's, it's fun and we could, I'm sure they'd still
3667400	3671480	want to play it once in a while, but it's like, it's not really engaging. It's not like something
3671480	3677400	that they would want to come back to all the time. They have trouble like setting it up. They don't
3677400	3685960	know how to like unfold the gates and everything, but, um, I mean, it's cool. I just, I think it's
3685960	3691080	going to get pushed by the wayside eventually, at least it folds down to a very small package.
3691080	3696520	And not unlike the, uh, lab stuff, which is just, well, was littered all over my house. I've
3696520	3702040	literally, I think I have thrown away some of the VR stuff, um, because it's just like, I'm not
3702040	3706200	going to play it. Uh, dark soccer. I'm sorry. What were you saying about Mario cart? You jumped in
3706200	3709720	there was something I wouldn't say anything about Mario cart. Oh, what did you say? Oh, okay. I
3709720	3716600	missed it. Sorry. I just said hard. Same. Oh, okay. I was agreeing with, with you about not
3716600	3723400	buying Labo because we knew it was going to be a waste. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Um, let's move on.
3723400	3730040	Let's talk about, um, things besides just Nintendo, uh, kind of a follow up, I guess, to another issue
3730040	3735000	that's been going on with the whole Twitch and the copyright crackdown and so forth. We're seeing
3735000	3741320	more and more games allow you to turn the music off, uh, or disable that element of the game so
3741320	3747880	that you can get around those types of issues on Twitch. Uh, and the game in question is FIFA 21.
3747880	3752920	Now this is notable because if I'm not mistaken, FIFA 21 is the biggest game in the world, right?
3752920	3759160	In the world. Okay. Cause remember Madden is like a very us based thing. When we consider the world,
3759160	3765960	it's about soccer and that's where FIFA is really a King of that. So, uh, FIFA 21 is going to allow
3765960	3771240	you to disable music, to avoid the copyright infringements. There was a title update that
3771240	3774520	went out. So it wasn't actually in the game to begin with because the game already came out,
3774520	3779560	but they did not in the game. Like don't they have independent volume between sound effects
3779560	3785160	and music. Hasn't that been a thing that's been like in games for decades now? Like how is that
3785160	3791160	now a notable thing? Like I understand like, um, the ability, like what they've had, like some
3791160	3795400	games, I don't remember the particulars, but there's some games that have like stream safe
3795400	3800440	versions where it's like music that let me, let me not license music. Loki, let me jump in. Cause
3800440	3805000	I think, you know, I want to make sure I clarify this. So there's actually a picture of the settings
3805000	3810200	menu I'm looking at, and there are options for menu sound effects, volume menu, music volume.
3810200	3815320	So you can do that, but this option is specifically disable all music for streaming
3815320	3820360	purposes. So my thought is there is probably a score of sorts in FIFA 21. Like there probably
3820360	3825240	is incidental music, background music, and so forth that is still in the game that does not
3825240	3832200	get removed when you do this. So, um, this is specifically for, and it is interesting that it
3832200	3837080	calls out and it even shows the option with the, uh, text at the bottom streaming or recording
3837080	3844120	FIFA, this setting disables all music to avoid copyright infringements. So, um, there is that.
3844120	3848760	So, but I will say, Loki, to your, your argument, the slider bar is also still there.
3849400	3856200	So, um, Bobby in chat says they use the license music for in studio sounds this, or in stadium
3856200	3861640	sounds rather this disables that orange, right? Says that's a really good idea. And Zen monkey
3861640	3866360	says, uh, Zen monkey 11 says, yes, you can lower FIFA music. Just lazy gamers, not looking at the
3866360	3871240	menu system. Um, orange right says, I know I'm thinking, ah, if I ever played burnout paradise,
3871240	3876120	that music volume is going all the way down. Yeah. And this is why usually when I play,
3876120	3880520	uh, these types of games I'm streaming in the, which isn't very often, I will usually stick to
3880520	3885640	classical music or I will have, which I has been pointed out previously. And yes, technically the
3885640	3891800	classical music is also because the recording itself is still something that is copyrightable,
3891800	3896200	but that stuff tends to not trigger strikes probably just because it is a very dear. It's
3896200	3902600	not, you know, it's not lady Gaga. That's the reality, right? Um, however, I also have a tendency
3902600	3908360	to, when I play those games, I just keep the game audio very, very low, either through what Loki's
3908360	3915240	talking about, or I just keep it so low that me talking over it constantly is just, it's going to
3915240	3920760	make the, you can barely even hear the music. And so I, and I haven't been flagged knock on wood
3920760	3924120	for anything on my personal channel and VOG certainly didn't, but we definitely,
3924120	3929000	we don't really stream games on this, hardly ever stream games on this channel. So, um, there is
3929000	3935560	that. So, um, we'll see. I heard another thing, by the way, since we're on the topic of Twitch,
3936120	3941640	I heard another thing. I don't know if you guys have heard about this and maybe Bobby in chat,
3941640	3947160	cause it was in discord, but somebody mentioned that Twitch mid-rolls were suddenly back on
3947240	3952760	certain streams that mid-roll ads were popping in. Is anybody in our chat getting that tonight? Like
3952760	3958760	are ads disabled? Because I have a hunch. What's that? Cause I tried to look on, on Twitter,
3958760	3964120	like with the tag, like what's going on. It seems like, and I could be wrong. It seems like the
3964120	3969800	people that are getting hit with those mid-roll ads are using some type of ad blocker on Twitch
3969800	3975640	or using something to try to suppress the ads on Twitch. So Twitch is kind of like one upping it by
3976280	3982440	putting these ads in a different way. So yeah, it worked out well for them. Yeah. Uh,
3982440	3986920	pixel pocket says it seems to me like some ad blockers stopped working. Act Def says,
3986920	3991480	considering that like 75% of us are subbed, I'm going to say no. You're right. We are very
3991480	3995240	fortunate that many of you are subscribed. Thank you for that. We're very lucky. Thank you. Thank
3995240	3999720	you. But surely there's a handful of people out there who are not subbed. And I'm just curious,
3999720	4004600	have you been getting mid-roll ads during the show? Because I watched, I watched a good hour
4004600	4008040	and a half of Twitch the other day. I didn't see them yet, but it might just be on certain
4008040	4014040	channels. I have no idea. So, uh, dark Tetsuya says I haven't seen any tonight watching on PS4.
4014040	4017240	I don't know how widespread it is yet, but didn't you get gifted a sub a couple of weeks ago,
4017240	4021880	dark Tetsuya? You might've been. Pixelbaka says I haven't gotten any ads so far this stream. So
4021880	4028920	we'll, we'll see. I don't know. I, again, I have, I hope it's not back because obviously we've
4028920	4034760	talked a lot about why that was a bad idea and we did a whole round table on this weeks ago.
4034760	4040360	If you haven't watched it yet, I, this is, this is why, even though, uh, Bobby and I recorded that
4040360	4044840	like the day after Twitch supposedly changed their policy, there's a lot of stuff in that that still
4044840	4050840	holds true. So go check that out over on YouTube or over at vognetwork.com. So, all right.
4051880	4056360	So anyhow, uh, but as far as the current Twitch issue that we know is out there with the copyright
4056360	4061240	stuff, uh, you'll probably see more games that are doing this, uh, that will help you be able
4061240	4066760	to stream on Twitch, uh, issue free. All right, let's move on dark soccer. You have something for
4066760	4075880	us, right? I do. And I had to remember that I don't no longer have my, uh, mute button on my mic.
4076760	4083160	So, um, I'm actually pretty excited about this and Dan actually was pretty excited too. He texted
4083160	4093640	me this, uh, so, um, arcade one up is, uh, doing pinball. I mean, pinball and, you know, that,
4093640	4101080	you know, is the magic word, uh, for me and in my house. So, um, they are doing, uh, a three quarter
4101080	4110200	scale, uh, pinball table, and it is going to be digital pinball. Um, there will be, um, uh, three
4110200	4114520	different ones that come with 10 different games. So to go ahead and start off with the first one,
4114520	4119320	it's Star Wars, uh, digital pinball. Then we have Marvel digital pinball and an attack from Mars
4119320	4125960	digital pinball, which I used to have an attack from Mars. So the games that come with, um, each
4125960	4131960	set, the Marvel games, uh, pinball includes Spider-Man, Civil War, Wolverine, X-Men, Thor,
4131960	4137720	Marvel's Women of Power, A-Force, Ghost Rider, Venom, Fantastic Four, and Fear itself. Star Wars
4137720	4144200	pinball has Boba Fett, A New Hope, Octo Island, Battle of Minbom, Darth Vader, Masters of the
4144200	4148440	Four, Star Wars Rebels, Han Solo, The Force Awakens, and Empire Strikes Back. That's a lot
4148440	4155560	of pinball. Um, now the attack from Mars pinball is actually real pinball. So, um, it's attack from
4155560	4161800	Mars, Fish Tales, The Getaway, Junkyard, Medieval Madness. I mean, right now getting that from
4161800	4167240	Medieval Madness, you know, um, Whitewater, which is another great one, although I'm sure it's not
4167320	4172440	going to come with the topper with the fan on it. Uh, Red and Ted, Fun House, which creeps me the
4172440	4177400	fuck out. Um, it's kind of like a giant head on it. The ones with heads freak me out. Uh,
4177960	4183880	Tales of the Arabian Nights and No Good Gophers. Um, Tales of the Arabian Nights, by the way,
4183880	4191160	is done by John Papadook, um, who, yep, you know what else he did? World Cup soccer and Theater of
4191160	4197000	Magic. Makes sense. They all have like a big thing in the middle of the table. Oh yeah.
4197480	4201800	But attack from Mars by itself is just a really fun one. Fish Tales is okay. We used to have a
4201800	4209160	getaway, um, which was a sequel to, um, great, no, I don't remember the name of the table. I
4209160	4218600	think I've covered the getaway. Um, I think that the, uh, that was a, uh, and I'm sorry,
4218600	4222520	it's going to, oh, it was High Speed 2. It was the, it was the sequel to High Speed.
4223160	4230200	Um, but yeah, it's, uh, it's really happy. No Good Gophers is a fun one. I love Tales of the
4230200	4234680	Arabian Nights. Fun House is, but it's a good table. Don't get me wrong. Whitewater is fun.
4235480	4242520	Medieval Madness though, um, for those who don't know, Medieval Madness recently had a re-release,
4242520	4248200	well, by recent, I mean, like a few years ago. We own one of the re-releases, like a special
4248200	4252920	edition of the re-release. Um, so it's missing like some of the branding on it and certain
4252920	4259400	things, but it is Attack from Mars. So these tables are going to stand, um, though they've
4259400	4266440	got a, uh, a 24 inch recessed screen. So it's going to be like, you're looking at it. It has
4266440	4273720	built an accelerometer so you can nudge and, you know, tilt if you screw up. Um, it is roughly,
4273720	4283240	I think three feet tall if I'm right. Um, and according to, um, uh, Arcade One Up, um,
4284200	4291160	on their site, it's supposed to arrive around December, 2020. Um, all of them, uh, it looks
4291160	4296680	like they're actually going to be sold physically through GameStop and Walmart. Um, and the Marvel
4296680	4303880	one apparently is already live for order at GameStop. Um, now, I mean, I, I, I'm reserving
4303880	4309720	judgment on the first two because clearly those are not like, and, but what I mean by legit
4309720	4316120	pinball is that they're not based off of legit tables, right? Right. They're the Zen pinball
4316120	4325000	original creations. Yeah, exactly. But, um, the Attack from Mars one is I think the one to have
4325000	4331480	if you love your, your classic pinball, that would be the one that we would get. Uh, we would
4331480	4339240	have to move things. I'm tempted, but I don't have any more room for those machines. The burger,
4339240	4345960	the burger time one was enough. What? It's a little one. We got to work on the house thing
4345960	4350440	first, by the way, I got to do just a quick aside because people, I know you Dark Soccer and Loki,
4350440	4355560	you can't see my camera because of the intense tech rig that we have here at OLR. They can only
4355560	4359960	hear my voice. They can't see me like you guys can on Twitch, but a mysterious hand just dropped
4359960	4366840	this box in frame. And, uh, some folks in chat are asking, what is this? So what this is, Alan
4366840	4374520	just got back from Costco and he just dropped this in front of me. This is a pack of 40 Stroop waffles
4374520	4383480	or Stroop waffles, if you will. 40 Costco sized box of Stroop waffles. The big one. This is big.
4383480	4388360	So I'm coming over. I'm not going to pay just, and my COVID test was negative. Dark Soccer is,
4388360	4393320	my COVID test was negative too about two weeks ago, but yes, hang out. This is, this is 40 cups
4393320	4399640	of coffee right here. Well, that's, you don't, you don't have to use coffee. You could use tears and
4399640	4408040	that's the way you're supposed to do it. You're supposed to put it on top of a cup of coffee
4408040	4412920	or, you know, whatever your hot drink is that you like, and that helps soften the cookie and
4412920	4417640	the syrup that's in there. So there you go. And there's only, I'm looking at it, there's only 140
4417640	4424600	calories in one Stroop waffle. So there you go. Latest Costco find from, uh, the husband. So thank
4424680	4430840	you, Alan, for bringing that to my attention and so much for any weight I was trying to lose.
4430840	4435480	See ya. Anyway, sorry, Dark Soccer, but, um, it was Stroop waffles. It's important.
4436120	4439720	Yeah. Well, at any rate though, I think that I actually already closed the article,
4439720	4445960	but I think they're supposed to retail for 500. Sounds about right. Yeah. Um, but yeah, um,
4447080	4454040	assuming that we do end up getting one, um, I think that we're gonna, um, I'll definitely,
4454040	4460120	we'll do something live for, for everybody when we get ours. Um, and by the way, Rob,
4460840	4466760	if you want to, I can send you my workout routine, which I'm still doing while I'm sick,
4466760	4470600	just a lighter one, because it involves my physical therapy. You know, it's interesting.
4470600	4477400	So the TV, the TV we got has all these built in things. And one of them is like a health channel
4477400	4481480	that has like workout videos on the man built right in the TV. And I don't know how good they
4481480	4487800	are, but, um, I like my workout videos, 1980s style. I want to see those obscene,
4487800	4491880	like tights that people used to wear in the, like the Jane Fonda workout tapes,
4491880	4498280	or I'm sorry, nothing will ever, ever top Richard Simmons sweat into the oldies.
4499240	4506040	I used to have the Cindy Crawford workout tape. Didn't share have a workout tape at one point.
4506680	4512200	Sure. Does everything she's a goddess, but this I'll tell you this right now that Cindy Crawford
4512200	4520680	workout tape was like a kick your ass. I mean, it was hard. And the fun thing about it is that
4520680	4530680	that is what got me into weightlifting when I was in high school. And, uh, after, uh, losing the
4530680	4534360	weight that I did, cause I was, you know, I was powerlifting before that and was building my dead
4534360	4539080	lift and I threw out my back. Um, I've been able to completely do my workout at home. I actually
4539080	4544920	wrote a blog for it, um, for, uh, Gen X geeks. Um, just, you know, putting out like what my
4544920	4549960	personal routine is, like what, what equipment that I have, cause it was really inexpensive
4549960	4555320	just to encourage everybody. So maybe. Chat, you guys are cracking me up. Uh,
4555320	4559720	Sia Tabiri says my grandma used to have the Angela Lansbury workout tape.
4559720	4563560	What? There was an Angela Lansbury workout tape. What?
4563560	4568280	Well I'm sure that the older crowd could make use of it.
4570440	4574920	So could the gays. We love murder. She wrote, come on. All right. Uh, let's see.
4574920	4580840	Sia Tabiri in chat says my sister and I each had one of the MTV grind tapes. Oh God.
4583480	4588680	Remember when there were shows on MTV, like the grind that was just people dancing. I mean,
4588680	4593880	that goes back to like, it was just soul train on MTV bandstand.
4595000	4598920	Is soul train still on? I think soul train is still on. It might be. I think they still do
4598920	4606360	make it in the Bay. What's his face? Dio Don Cornelius. Yeah. The Bay area had some
4606360	4611640	local TV show that was a dance thing too, because Mel was on it like twice.
4612600	4617640	Soul train ended in 2006, but they do have like the soul train awards.
4617640	4621720	Okay. Is Don Cornelius still alive? He'd know he died in 2012.
4621720	4627080	Yeah. Yeah. Anyway. All right. I used to watch soul train regularly.
4627080	4630360	Same. It was all that was on like Saturday morning when I was awake.
4631160	4634120	Right after my cartoons. It came on after my cartoons.
4634120	4640200	All right. Let's move on. We're running long on the show tonight. We got other topics to talk
4640200	4646040	about, but I know it's hard not to get derailed by Angela Lansbury and soul train. Uh, moving on,
4646200	4652040	uh, Oh, I got, I thought you were laughing, dark soccer, but that was coughing. I was like,
4652040	4656760	what's so funny? Oh, that's not funny. I felt it come. That's why I've been keeping my line
4656760	4662120	muted so that I wouldn't, you know, put lungs on the air. All right. Fair enough. Uh, Loki,
4662120	4669480	what's next in the gaming world? So, because, um, another, I think this bit's confusing. In fact,
4669480	4674440	I was actually talking with Exeter on Twitter about it because he had purchased a PlayStation
4674440	4679960	five with a place new PlayStation five HD camera. I'm like, Oh, what's that used for?
4679960	4684120	Because I don't think that's compatible with the PlayStation VR. And that's really the only thing
4684120	4689480	I use my camera for. And he's like, Oh, it's only for web, you know, for, um, you know,
4690040	4696760	broadcasting yourself on playing games and stuff. Um, so to solve that problem, because apparently
4696760	4700200	the PlayStation camera that came with the PlayStation four is the only compatible with
4700200	4705560	the PlayStation VR. And so if you want to play PlayStation VR games on the PlayStation five,
4705560	4709560	you need some way to plug it in since it doesn't have the proprietary connector on the back of the
4709560	4713960	PlayStation five, how are you going to do that? Well, the way you're going to do that is you go
4713960	4721960	to Sony's official website and you request a, um, a free cable. And the way you do that,
4721960	4726920	you have to provide them with the serial number on your PlayStation VR unit and your shipping
4726920	4732920	information. And they will ship it to you for free. So it may take up to two weeks to get that
4732920	4739800	in. Um, that kind of sucks. Although I want to say that like, it's something similar. They did
4739800	4747080	something similar with, um, the connect back in the day because the new systems that they made
4747080	4753160	the newer slimmer models had the connect port built in, but the older original, uh, Xbox three
4753160	4757480	sixties did not have that. And so you had to have an adapter to plug it in that that you could
4757480	4765240	request for free as well. Um, but still annoying that you have to do that. All these hoops to jump
4765240	4769000	through. I don't understand why the new camera, especially since it's a better camera, you would
4769000	4775080	think that it being a better camera might make it work better, but maybe, I guess it just doesn't,
4775080	4781960	maybe it doesn't protect the dot field or whatever it needs to track stuff. Just you would think that
4781960	4787400	they would support something like, I don't know, but whatever. It's a hope you got to jump through
4787400	4792360	if you want to use, you know, the PlayStation VR and the new system. And I'm still curious what
4792360	4798040	like, cause I know we're getting upgrades with faster load times and all that stuff for, um,
4798760	4802600	the PlayStation five and playing PlayStation four games. I'm curious to see what kind of
4802600	4806760	enhancements we get with PlayStation VR games. Since I know with the pro, we have like higher
4806760	4810600	resolution and more details and stuff like that. If we're going to get something similar with,
4810600	4814840	uh, the PlayStation five as well, or if it's going to go even beyond what was offered with
4814840	4818840	the PlayStation four pro. I honestly feel like based on the comments, I guess we didn't have
4818840	4824120	the related story tagged. I, maybe you saw this Loki about the, the comments from the CEO on VR
4824120	4829480	and how it sounds like VR is kind of on, I don't want to say it's like, it's like on hold for the
4829480	4834360	minute. It sounds like, like they're just not really making anything for PS VR right now. And
4834360	4838760	that's something they're going to revisit later on the PS PlayStation, the PlayStation VR too.
4838760	4843000	Yeah. Which is, I mean, I don't know. I have mixed feelings on it because I'm kind of like,
4843000	4848040	well, if the PlayStation VR is like the number one headset right now, like keep that train rolling.
4848040	4853720	And it just kind of like insert another joke here about Sony really not supporting their hardware,
4853720	4860280	but at the same time X files poster, I want to believe, um, that they're going to, you know,
4861400	4866920	maybe focus on this part of PlayStation five and getting the games there for the more traditional
4866920	4871960	type of media first. And then they'll kind of take a good hard look at VR later with some of
4871960	4876520	the leaps and bounds that, you know, the VR technology has made such as potentially,
4876520	4881880	you know, that PlayStation four VR has wires, wires, lots of wires, and we know that VR is
4881880	4885880	getting more and more to a place where there's going to be a lot less or perhaps none at all,
4885880	4891720	perhaps, but you know, we'll see what they decide to do. Um, so I, Loki, I would just say
4892520	4897560	beyond the perks of loading times on the solid state drive and what the PlayStation four pro
4897560	4901640	could do. I wouldn't set the bar too high. Like it's probably going to be like playing it on a
4901640	4907960	PlayStation four pro. Yeah. Someone's someone needs to remind Sony that the V and PSVR does
4907960	4913320	not stand for Vita. So they probably shouldn't just forget about it. Well, and my question is,
4913880	4920040	okay, so Sony wants to put it on hold, but what about third-party developers? So I guess
4920040	4924120	if they're going to continue to make VR games, they're essentially making PlayStation four VR
4924120	4929400	games. Um, that would be, uh, workable through backwards compatibility, but you're probably
4929400	4933320	going to see a lot of developers want to, I mean, you'll probably see less and less PlayStation
4933320	4939160	exclusives and more games that are like, you can play it on PlayStation four VR, or you can play
4939160	4947080	it on Oculus, or you can play it on, you know, HTC vibe and so forth. My assumption is when we
4947080	4953960	see the play, like if we had gotten a PlayStation two VR now, it probably wouldn't look very
4953960	4960120	different or it would be really expensive. And that's a lot to ask, put, put down $500 for a
4960120	4965480	PlayStation five and another $500 for the PlayStation headset. That is a lot to ask.
4965480	4971960	So I kind of understand the strategy behind, maybe we don't want to do the new VR headset this year.
4971960	4976920	Let's do that in a year or probably even better because of the pandemic and everything it's
4976920	4982680	done to 2020. Let's do that in 2022. So that's my guess is you're going to see a PlayStation VR
4982680	4989320	two in 2022. And then at that point, it will be about, well, where is the technology for VR at
4989320	4994120	that point? How is that going to work into the very consumer friendly, you know, type of PlayStation
4994120	5000280	VR system. But I think if Sony really wants us to believe that they're invested in it,
5000280	5007560	I really want to see them make a game that is like for PlayStation VR two, not something that's
5007560	5012600	like enhanced or better with. I want to see that too, but I want to see them really make a game for
5012600	5019000	this PlayStation VR two. And I, I think that will probably be something to look forward to in 2022.
5019000	5025320	So from that standpoint, I do kind of get what they're doing. I mean, let's be real. If they
5025320	5030760	were putting out a PS five VR headset now, you would not want to pay for that and a PlayStation
5030760	5034680	five. You're just not, some people would, of course they would, but it's not going to be
5034680	5040600	enough. So I understand why they're like, we're going to wait a little bit, even though they're
5040600	5049640	on the top right now of the VR game. So, all right, let's move on and talk about, um, a
5049640	5053400	company that I wish would get out of gaming altogether, but I'm a little bit biased, I
5053400	5059880	suppose. And it's Facebook. Uh, Facebook is getting into cloud gaming. Why not? Huh?
5059880	5065080	Everybody, another company to join the party. You've got Stadia. You've got Luna from Amazon.
5065080	5071320	You've got, um, X cloud. Why not? Let's have Facebook in this as well. So now Facebook has
5071320	5077960	launched their own cloud gaming service. Um, but here's some, are you going to be able to play,
5078600	5083480	control, or are you going to be able to play, I don't know, uh, destiny or whatever the
5085480	5093240	no, you can play asphalt nine legends, PGA tour, golf shootout, solitaire, Arthur's tale,
5093240	5101640	and mobile legends adventure, which is pretty much cookie clicker, but as, as a, uh, RPG or
5101640	5108520	whatever. In other words, these are fairly mundane mobile games and look, there is a time and a place
5108520	5114360	for mundane mobile games. I love things like cookie clicker when I'm opening it for 30 seconds in the
5114360	5119240	checkout line at target or something. And then, you know, going on to whatever else is going on
5119240	5127560	as far as cloud streaming though. Uh, okay. This is a weird thing to launch, but anyway, if you
5127560	5133880	want to check it out, I guess you could find them in the gaming section of Facebook. Oh, by the way,
5133880	5139560	that's also where you'll find their, um, competitor to Twitch and that whole thing. And where mixer
5139560	5146040	ended up pointing people to, um, at some point there are going to be cloud playable ads in your
5146040	5150920	Facebook newsfeed. So in other words, if you're not opening the gaming hub enough, as you're
5150920	5156440	scrolling through your Facebook feed and endlessly doom scrolling, uh, all the updates and so forth,
5156440	5163880	you're going to see not just an ad, but an ad you can play live. So it'll be like a gaming ad
5163880	5170360	you could just jump right into. Think about how the here's the thing. They're using it for gaming
5170360	5177720	now, but think about what this is going to be when bam, you jump right into a 3d virtual house tour
5177720	5182600	or you jump into, I mean, there's a lot of places I think where this technology could end up going.
5183000	5188280	And that's what Facebook wants to get into, I suppose. So, uh, this service is also coming to
5188280	5193800	the dedicated Facebook gaming app on Android. As we know, there is not a dedicated Facebook gaming
5193800	5200280	app on iOS because the cloud gaming and iOS have not, uh, figured that out yet. Although we are
5200280	5207320	seeing web based apps as a solution and perhaps that will come in the future. So, um, we'll see,
5207320	5213240	but nothing to say officially on that right now. So, uh, SHO and her mat says fairly mundane,
5213240	5219320	much like surfing Facebook. Uh, so there you go. Uh, Zen monkey 11 said the games sound like
5219320	5225560	clone apps. Yeah. I I'm not exactly jumping to reactivate my Facebook account so I can play
5225560	5235160	these games. Uh, I'll say that much. So anybody going to check out Facebook gaming? No. Okay. No.
5235800	5244040	I, I block every game request thing that comes across my plate anyway. So I, I hate them. I
5244040	5249400	don't want a game in Facebook. I don't want to play any of their shit. I don't want to give them
5249400	5255560	any more money. The only reason I have a Facebook anyway, still is for my sister's stuff and for
5255560	5261240	the communities I'm running. So I don't want to give them any more fucking attention. Remember
5262120	5268200	when the most annoying thing on Facebook was a poke is still fucking annoying. Can you still
5268200	5273800	poke people on Facebook? You can still poke. I have, I was up to like 400 with one of my friends.
5275240	5283000	That's a lot of poking. Well, uh, did, did they, didn't they have a thing?
5283000	5286840	When they're an app called poke at some point, it was like their Snapchat competitor or something.
5286920	5291960	And it's, it's long gone. Uh, let's see sacred Jade and chat over Twitch TV slash
5291960	5297640	vog network says hard pass on Facebook gaming. I deleted my Facebook profile. Congratulations.
5297640	5304200	Um, I can't, I understand. I understand. I only deactivated and you know, I may go back as
5304200	5308840	especially, you know, after the election, I might be able to tolerate it again. We'll see. I'm
5308840	5313560	practically living on Twitter these days when I was like pretty much like a not Twitter person.
5313560	5318040	Twitter, Twitter is just a, it is, I get why Twitter is really annoying, but yeah,
5318040	5324440	Twitter is so much more cure curatable if you know how to do it because people get really
5324440	5329160	annoyed when it's like, Oh, you get your default Twitter feed that shows every, but once you learn
5329160	5333080	how to really curate Twitter and make it work for you, it's, Oh my God, it's, it's great. Now
5333080	5336600	it's not a perfect platform. Look at my wild at my life feed anyway. And then I check the people
5336600	5341640	I care about. Yeah. Zen monkey 11 says I want my space back. Love the Twitter. So funny in there.
5341640	5347080	I want my space back too. I want to have, you know what? I I'm sick of this disagreeing on,
5347080	5353400	on politics and that whole thing. I want the fights to be about why aren't I in your top eight?
5354520	5359240	That's the fights I miss on my space. Jamie, did you have me in your top eight on my space?
5359240	5363720	I hope so. You know, as a matter of fact, I did. I think I'm pretty sure I had you there too. I
5363720	5367640	think I had, I think that was right. That was right around the time oil are launched. So I
5367640	5372440	think I had to have you and Loki in the top eight on my space. I'd have to look for my account
5372440	5380440	again, but I know that it was you and Jessica and Matt. And, uh, you know, I think my friend Risa
5381240	5386760	OLR had a MySpace. I know it did because we had clips of the show. I'm talking like early ass
5386760	5392440	fucking clips of the show on our MySpace page. So I doubt it's there anymore. I don't know. Good
5392440	5402520	luck to you if you can find it. All right. Anyway, let's move on. Uh, let's oh, oh boy.
5402520	5406600	Let's follow up Facebook with a political story, but this was, this was a lot softer, right?
5407480	5415720	Yeah. I mean, and it's just kind of a, a little thing. Um, basically, um, in Fortnite, Joe Biden
5415720	5422600	has a map and might've covered this in the past that there was one with, um, animal crossing.
5422600	5427880	There was an animal crossing town dedicated to the Biden campaign. And I'll tell you,
5427880	5439400	I'll tell you what are, I mean, I, I, I vote blue, but I'm a socialist at heart and I, I am so in my
5439400	5446200	heart happy to see that it, you know, people embracing video games to reach that audience,
5446200	5452200	you know, who their people are, where all the GOP is still like, Hey, get off my lawn. Yeah. Um,
5452200	5459720	but anyway, um, yeah, there's a Fortnite map dedicated, uh, to, uh, to the Biden campaign and
5459720	5469240	to, uh, Kamala Harris. And, um, there's like, uh, different, um, different, like, uh, TV monitors
5469240	5477400	in there that have like different things like, uh, um, uh, build back better and like, uh,
5477400	5483560	this one screenshot here in subway, like there's no Malarkey station and Harris highway and all of
5483560	5491800	that. Um, and so, uh, but then the map is called build back better with Biden. Um, and it's
5491800	5499480	supposed to educate young voters on what the democratic party stands for. Um, and then, uh,
5500200	5507000	it takes you on like this adventure through this reboot city, um, where, uh, you can stay on like
5507000	5513880	this Island and you have many quests to do and you have to collect countless sneakers and check
5513880	5522120	out Joe's ice cream shop. And so it is pretty cool. The code to get to this is, uh, zero two
5522120	5530200	one five four five one one one eight two three. Um, so yeah, it is pretty much, you know, it's
5530200	5539320	focused on, uh, on Biden's campaign and education. Um, but it's, it's a good idea. It's the type of
5539320	5546680	thing, you know, like what AOC was doing with, uh, with her, uh, uh, live streaming, you know,
5547560	5554680	and by the way, if anyone is interested for the animal crossing one and the Biden HQ Island,
5555000	5563000	the, uh, dream address code is seven two eight six five seven one zero seven four seven eight
5564280	5569960	da first, of course, because it's a dream address. No. Um, I was just saying, I just want to ask like
5569960	5574040	a serious question here because obviously, obviously it's no secret that I'm team Biden
5574040	5578840	on this. I mean, I was team Warren, but I, I, I, I'm more than happy to be team Biden when
5578840	5583240	presented with the other option. And I've made it no secret how I feel about that on this program.
5583240	5589880	But the, the hard question I want to ask is, is there really a point to this? Is there going to be
5589880	5596440	fun to be had here because video games are supposed to be fun or is this obvious propaganda?
5596440	5603800	Because I mean, what made AOC's Twitch stream really, really work is that it was very organic
5603800	5610280	and it didn't feel like even the politics that were in it did not feel forced. Her lines of
5610280	5615960	don't forget to vote and talking to the British guy about healthcare, uh, in, in his world versus
5615960	5621480	ours was that it felt very organic and it felt very much like a Twitch streamer, thanking someone
5621480	5626840	for the donation or talking to friends on discord. And I think that's why AOC stream, whether you
5626840	5633400	agree with her or not really worked is Biden's going to feel organic or is it going to feel like,
5633400	5639320	okay, I just went to propaganda Ville. It's not intended to be organic, not like AOC's thing,
5639320	5646040	but you know, it's intended to, it is, it is a campaign strat. I mean, fair and simple.
5646040	5652920	Um, in fact, with Biden's Island on animal crossing, like the house inside has, is filled
5652920	5657880	with like desk and campaign pamphlets and promotional materials. It's been turned into,
5657880	5664920	uh, a campaign office, but, but yeah, but the whole thing is it gets people talking,
5664920	5671720	it gets interest, whether or not you want to go to that either location in whatever game or
5671720	5677320	whether or not you say, Oh, well, you know, that's a stupid idea or he's just, you know, pandering,
5677320	5682040	you're talking about it. Fair. And you know, and you know what the answer might be? I'm actually,
5682040	5686760	actually what ultimately where this goes is because this is in the news and you know,
5686760	5691560	they know to an extent it's going to be in the news. Um, there are people on Twitch that will
5691560	5696120	do a Twitch stream where it's like, I'm going to go visit the Joe Biden Island or I'm going to go
5696120	5701960	visit the Joe Biden, uh, Fortnite map. And now they're having an organic conversation about
5701960	5709080	politics on their Twitch feed. And maybe that is this it's, it's not necessarily the map or the
5709080	5714600	Island or whatever it is themselves. It's maybe the conversation that it starts. Well, and that's
5714600	5723320	what I just said that. Yes, I guess it is. Yes. It's it's they're, they're talking about it. It's
5723320	5727240	getting it out there and you know, and the people are going to be cool. Let me check the Biden thing
5727240	5732600	because when it's, you know, it's going to get me clicks. I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm laughing
5732600	5736680	because a headline just scrolled by, you know how on Twitch we have the headlines at the bottom,
5736680	5742520	a headline just scrolled by that said from Kotaku bad cat. And that was the headline. I'm like,
5742520	5747240	what the fuck video game is that bad cat? Did you guys see that?
5748600	5754760	Um, Oh my God, that just, that actually last night, um, you know, one of the things I mentioned
5754760	5761160	I had to do for Gish was, uh, resurrect my inner child via a spell. Um, and Midna wanted to be a
5761160	5767080	part of it. She wanted to run off with one of the GI Joes. I still have, she wanted to run off with
5767080	5773480	snake guys, just saying, I mean, I would run off with snake guys just saying, but that that's bad
5773480	5781960	cat, bad cat context to, to clarify what bad cat actually was in the Kotaku article. It's a mod for
5781960	5787160	resident evil that turns, I forget what the giant like zombie thing is, but turns it into, uh,
5790200	5794920	was it Tom from Tom and Jerry? Oh God. Okay. The tyrant.
5795640	5799640	Okay. So, so it is video game related. So it was a game related headline. Who knew?
5800760	5804280	All right, let's move on. We're running so long tonight. It's going to be,
5805800	5812600	let's move on. Who's next? Uh, is it Loki? Yeah, it's me. Uh, so let's talk about a launch game
5812600	5816440	that's getting delayed for the PlayStation five. So one of the games they were showing
5816440	5820600	off was destruction all stars, which was supposed to be launched title.
5820600	5829560	Also one of those launch titles that's $70. Ooh boy. That's Sony upcharge. Um, it is now
5829560	5835720	coming out in February, 2021, according to the PlayStation blog, um, as an added bonus as well
5835720	5841080	for PlayStation plus subscribers, it'll be available for free for two months for no additional
5841080	5849960	costs. So you'll get it as far as PlayStation plus that's better than paying $70. Yes. So it's
5850040	5855560	interesting. It's very much a case of bad news. It's delayed. Good news. Uh, most people that are,
5855560	5859560	you know, probably investing this money on PlayStation early are also PlayStation plus,
5859560	5865880	so you're gonna get it for free. So yeah. Yeah. It's, I guess the news could have been a lot worse,
5865880	5871560	right? That's true. That's the interesting thing. Halo got delayed, but it's going to be on Xbox
5871560	5877080	game pass. And again, chances are, you know what, if you are adopting Xbox series X right away,
5877080	5881960	you probably have game pass, not everybody, but most people probably do. All right. Well,
5881960	5888760	speaking of releases and, uh, games that got bumped back, uh, you'll notice what was absent
5888760	5895400	from my gaming week already. World of Warcraft shadow lands. So that was a fun week and now
5895400	5901800	we're back. But, um, and I did play a lot of Final Fantasy 11. Oops, but no, I, I, I'm, you know,
5901800	5907240	what 14 Final Fantasy 14. Oh shit. I said 11. Didn't I? Sorry. Yes. 14. You're not playing
5907240	5912920	11 without me. What? Sorry. Sorry. My 2006 brain kicked in the mobile version finally came out.
5912920	5918440	No, no, no. Yes. If I was 14. Sorry. Um, but anyway, yeah, I don't know. I I'd be curious
5918440	5923080	about the expansion. I just don't know if I'm $50 curious, but I know there's a lot of people that
5923080	5927560	love their Warcraft and love their characters. And I am happy to report for all of you that shadow
5927560	5932440	lands is finally going to be coming out on November 23rd. Hey, that's a special day for
5932440	5937880	Warcraft because it is the 16th anniversary of the game. Um, not that 16 is often a number that
5937880	5942040	gets celebrated unless you're an MTV show where, um, kids scream when they don't get the car they
5942040	5947560	want. Uh, but for this sweet 16, uh, world of Warcraft shadow lands will finally be released.
5947560	5952840	And, uh, there, it even comes out, it comes out at 3 PM Pacific time on that day because they have
5952840	5956040	to do it that way because people all around the world are playing this game. And, you know,
5956040	5959880	it's going to be a world rush to who can take that boss down first. So it goes live at the
5959880	5965240	same time for everybody. Uh, so that ended up being a four week delay, which all things
5965240	5971560	considered was not a terrible delay for the game. Um, but there's also going to be a warmup event,
5971560	5977320	whatever that means on November 10th, where you will be able to take on a flood of scourge.
5977320	5981560	I seem to remember when the last expansion was about to come out, there was an event like this,
5981560	5986440	and it was a really easy way to gain levels fast. So I wonder if this will be a thing that's
5986440	5991160	similar. I don't know, but November 10th is when the flood of the scourge happens. And also there
5991160	5997720	will be season one of shadow lands on December 8th, I guess that's PVP and the first raid castle
5997720	6004280	nathria will also open on December 8th. So you can take your time getting to the new level cap of
6004280	6008600	60, excuse me, uh, before you take on the raids. I actually liked that they don't release that
6008600	6014920	stuff right away to be honest. So, all right. Um, pod culture points out, uh, November 23rd is also
6014920	6019640	Dr. Who day. And you know, I imagine there's a lot of stuff kind of happening that day because it's,
6019640	6025560	it's the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, right? Thanksgiving is the 26th, right? Or 27th,
6025560	6030040	something like that. So it's, it's just days before, um, Thanksgiving. And that's like,
6030040	6036280	you know, right before the retail season kicks off. Although I'm sure Black Friday, as we know
6036280	6040680	it here in the States is going to look a lot different this year. You're already seeing stores
6040680	6045560	like Best Buy and stuff are kind of like, we're going to start early and kind of push you more
6045560	6050280	towards online for obvious reasons with everything going on in the world. I'm sure there will still
6050280	6055720	be, I'm sure there will still be plenty of people that are going to the store on Black Friday, but,
6055720	6061800	um, not me, that's for sure. So, and I think, I think stores are kind of realizing they got to
6061800	6065720	think outside the box a little bit that not everybody's going to want to rush the store,
6065720	6072760	um, early that day. So, all right. Yeah. And DJRama S is, uh, uh, uh, kind of concurring there,
6072760	6078280	uh, Black Friday deals done started. I'm good with this. Yeah, for sure. All right. Well,
6078280	6083560	let's take a trip down memory lane when if a game was delayed by four weeks, we didn't know about
6083560	6088520	it. Um, because we got our gaming news through magazines, there was no internet. It's the classic
6088520	6093320	game of the week. Every week, dark soccer steps into the gaming vault to define a game that she
6093320	6098840	thinks, Hey, you know what, brats, you should be checking out this game. Forget your newfangled
6098840	6105320	Xbox series Xs and your PlayStation fives. I want you to go back to the PlayStation one. No way. I
6105320	6111400	want you to go back sooner than that and check out this classic game of the week. Dark soccer.
6111400	6122520	What'd you pick for the kids tonight? I picked, uh, an RPG that is as iconic as anything else
6122520	6130520	that this company has released. I picked Romancing Saga, which came out in 1992. It is a RPG, uh,
6130520	6136280	developed and published by Square. It came out for the Super Famicom. Um, now it's actually the,
6136280	6146280	uh, fourth game in the saga series. Um, and this particular one, um, actually had like a
6146280	6153080	bunch of different, um, various releases on it. And it was a fairly, as far as some will say is
6153080	6162680	kind of a big one. Um, this, uh, this one was actually, we made, um, for, uh, the Wonder
6162680	6169160	Swan color. Um, it was done for mobile phones. Um, and I'll be getting into that, uh, in a
6169160	6179640	little bit, but this is, uh, this is a game that while, um, not many people will think of in the,
6179640	6188440	in the saga series. Um, it was one of the first ones that, um, so that's fine. Um, anyway, um,
6189240	6195160	you, uh, you basically follow eight different protagonists on different quests throughout the
6195160	6202120	world, and they all accumulate in a fight against the dark god, uh, Saruin. I guess that's how it's
6202120	6207240	pronounced. That's always how I did it. Um, and it's very nonlinear. Um, you do have term-based
6207240	6215480	battles, um, group formations, and like the other saga titles, there are no experience points. Um,
6215480	6221320	your character attributes and skills are determined by what you do in battle. Um,
6222520	6231160	so it was, um, you know, so the other saga games, um, this was supposed to be the, uh,
6231160	6236680	the new one for the Super Famicom. There have been others on Game Boy. Um, they brought back,
6236680	6243080	um, the series creator, um, Kazu Akitoshi as the director, the designer and writing the scenarios.
6243640	6250360	Um, and then, uh, the character designs were done by Kobayashi Tomomi, which actually is her first
6250360	6255880	work that she did for the series. Um, music done by Ito Kenji, who also did like Final Fantasy
6255880	6262360	Legend 2. Um, so it had a really, really good, uh, design group behind it right away.
6263160	6270200	So when you start off the game, um, you're going to choose your first protagonist and you're going
6270200	6277320	to, um, explore the world. You know, it's free, free, free reign over everything. You know,
6277880	6283160	you trigger different story points as you go through it. You have battles, side quests,
6283160	6289480	and then you're going to build up your party as you go along. Um, some members, um, that you can
6289480	6296920	recruit are the protagonist you didn't choose. Um, and so, uh, your progress is based on the number
6296920	6302760	of the main events, um, your strength, who you've talked to, um, and it's been called the free
6302760	6308600	scenario system. Um, you encounter enemy sprites on the field, you fight with them, you have a
6308600	6315400	three by three grill, uh, grid, um, that affects how you're going to be able to interact with the
6315400	6324120	enemy. Um, so, uh, there, there was a big remake done for now. This is the big one on here, um,
6324200	6330040	is it was remade for PlayStation two, which was subtitled, uh, minstrel song. It was released,
6330040	6340360	uh, by, uh, Squenix in 2005. Um, with, uh, this one, it does have, uh, the non-linear exploration,
6340360	6346840	but the environments are all in 3d. Um, and it brought in some elements from the later saga
6346840	6353080	titles. Um, and, uh, when you choose your, uh, you know, your protagonist, you go through the
6353080	6359240	game the same way. You have a quick save, uh, you have a hard saves in, you know, your towns
6359240	6364760	where things like that are, um, and you customize your party, you have your character classes,
6364760	6373080	um, and a character can lose their life points. Um, so like your character health is a combination
6373080	6377480	of your standard health and your life points and you lose life points being knocked out enough
6377480	6382760	times in a battle. And then you lose all of your life points. The game is over. So that's
6382840	6390280	kind of an interesting take on it. Um, but yeah, it did, uh, it did, uh, start its development in
6390280	6396520	1990. Um, and they really wanted to go to the super Famicom because the other saga games on
6396520	6404200	Game Boy had been so popular. Um, and so, um, and actually we did get final fantasy legend three,
6404200	6411000	it was a saga three. Um, but they really wanted it to be a particular saga game.
6411000	6417800	The name Romancing, uh, actually, uh, was, uh, inspired by an American movie Romancing Stone.
6418520	6425640	Remember that movie? Like Kathleen Turner, right? Yeah. Um, and the producer of the game was, uh,
6425640	6433480	Miyamoto Masumi, who was the founder and former president of Square. So, um, so yeah, the, the
6433480	6441160	game had, uh, a pretty big release when it came out January 28th, 1992. Um, and it was the second
6441160	6446200	super Famicom title that Square did. It followed final fantasy four, which we got, of course, this
6446200	6452760	too. Um, it dated three guidebooks for it. Um, it got a virtual console re-release on the Wii in
6452760	6462600	2009, Wii U in 2015 and 3DS in 2016. Um, it was supposed to have been, uh, uh, localized,
6462600	6469320	um, to be brought out in the US. Um, it was, uh, stated by Gameport in 1993, but it never got
6469320	6475880	released outside of Japan. Um, the text translation and complexity of the game they figured would be
6475880	6482280	off-putting and not cost-effective given what they projected this to be. Um, at any rate, um,
6482280	6488440	in 2000, uh, they did a version, an enhanced version of Romancing Saga for the Wonder Swan
6488440	6495800	color. Um, and we know that Square really loved the Wonder Swan color doing this out. Um, but,
6495800	6505240	uh, it was, it was, uh, not on Game Boy Advanced and that's because Square and Nintendo, that was
6505240	6510840	when they were having their thing when Square went to PlayStation, remember? Um, yeah, so all that,
6510840	6515720	but they added, um, a few new abilities that you could dash and avoid enemy encounters,
6516280	6523160	um, different materials, a couple of stories, uh, changes, different side quests. Um, and it was part
6523160	6529640	of the Square Masterpiece series of classic titles for Wonder Swan. Um, it was ported to mobile
6529640	6535560	platforms by Square Enix. Um, it was based off Wonder Swan port. Um, they just did the graphics
6535560	6542520	for mobile. Um, it came out for, in 2009, for iMode phones, um, and then for the SoftBank phones
6542520	6551080	and EasyWeb, and it closed, uh, down in 2018. So then there's the PS2 remake, which was Romancing
6551080	6558760	Saga menstrual song. Um, and it was like rebuilt from the ground up, like I said. Um, and the,
6558760	6567400	the art style references the sprite design, but tried to go a little bit more like some of the
6567400	6573560	Final Fantasy series. And it has a completely different taste. It was meant to appeal strictly
6574360	6581160	to, um, not really appeal to any particular market, just be something that's, that's
6582040	6588760	attractive overall. Um, and, uh, the game was re-released through PlayStation Network for
6588760	6594600	PlayStation 3 eventually. Um, and then a special edition that had a download code and jigsaw
6594600	6601000	artwork done by Kobayashi, um, the designer. Um, there was supposed to be, uh, they actually
6601000	6607560	announced a North American re, uh, release at E3 in 2005, um, along with, uh, Dragon Quest 8,
6607560	6615240	Final Fantasy 7, and Kingdom Hearts 2. Um, it released on October 11th. They removed a
6615240	6621960	menstrual song from the title. Um, they did, uh, some dubbing, um, done by New Generation Pictures,
6621960	6626280	um, who had worked with Squenix on some of the Final Fantasy and Valkyrie profile series.
6626920	6635960	And then there was a European released after that. Um, so, uh, this, uh, the original title
6635960	6641400	wasn't remastered because we drew, I guess they dropped the menstrual song for us.
6641400	6645640	It had really good music. I mean, I don't know how much of the video I let you listen to,
6645640	6651880	but the music in this game is really top notch. It's just that got that square brilliance to it
6651880	6659560	as, as the RPGs on the SNES that most of the RPGs we did on the SNES, um, display. Um, so for the
6659560	6666680	Super Famicom version, it is ranked as the fifth best-selling saga game of all time. Um, it is sold
6666680	6673160	more than 1.3 million copies worldwide with 1.1 million, of course, sold in Japan and those others
6673160	6682520	overseas. Uh, Hamitsu, um, didn't like the graphics as much as Final Fantasy 4, but they liked the
6682520	6691560	system. And so, uh, Hamitsu score was, uh, 31 of 40 for Super Famicom, 32 of 40 for, uh, PS2, which
6691560	6697240	by Famitsu, not bad, not bad at all. And I can actually see that criticism. I mean, I, I never
6697240	6701880	played this game because obviously it wasn't, you know, released here until, uh, you got the
6701880	6706600	translation hacks and the other versions you were talking about. Um, but I can see that criticism is
6706600	6711880	that, you know, especially these battle scenes look very plain, I guess. And even the world maps,
6711880	6716760	they look very plain compared to Final Fantasy 2, which is what we would know it as in America,
6716760	6722040	but you all know it's actually for, um, as, but I can see that the battle system does, it does seem
6722040	6727160	like there's, there's more to it. So I actually, it's interesting, just not even knowing that much
6727160	6732360	about the game, but based on like what you just said, I can like kind of see that. Yeah. And one
6732360	6737640	of the, one of the things with it though, is that, uh, American critics kind of panned the, um, the
6737640	6745000	battle system in it because they thought it was too complex. But I mean, I liked it. You know,
6745000	6749720	when I played a little bit of it, you know, back on my, you know, fan translated emulation days,
6750360	6757560	um, it, it's, it's a solid game with a solid story. Um, uh, but moving, moving forward,
6757560	6763880	of course, um, it proved to be so popular and influential that, um, you know, and of course
6763880	6768840	it brought in new mechanics and a new type of, of gameplay that after it was so successful,
6768840	6774440	they did two further titles for Super Famicom. They had Romancing Saga 2 and Romancing Saga 3.
6774440	6784760	Um, uh, 2 came out in 93 and 3 came out in 95. And so that's the game. Um, I, I like what ACT
6784760	6792040	DEV said, then we got Mystic Quest. Um, Mystic Quest wasn't bad. It was like RPG for very small
6792040	6796840	children. And it had a great score. We'll give, we'll give Mystic Quest that it had good music.
6797640	6805160	Yeah. And, you know, I honestly, I think that the, you know, and you know, how much like the
6805160	6812200	saga games, uh, like that came out on PlayStation go for. Oh yeah. You know, um, Saga Frontier,
6812200	6818840	um, you know, all of those, they. Which is funny cause I rented Saga Frontier once and I hated it.
6819800	6826760	Yeah. You know, I have, um, crap was that I had another saga game that I have in Japanese,
6826760	6835080	honestly. And it ended up being like way too like advanced, uh, text heavy that I couldn't,
6835880	6841080	couldn't really do. Um, but yeah. Um, but I mean, it's just,
6841960	6849640	it's a shame that we never got the Super Famicom. We could have had it. Um, and I think that,
6849640	6857560	you know, this particular game is just, you know, it, it really did something, you know, like,
6857560	6862840	like I say, it was a square second game on the system and I think it really set off a boom in
6862840	6870520	JRPGs on the Super Famicom. So, um, but of course, you know, for the other games in the title,
6871240	6876360	of course, the saga games, um, came out in the US as Final Fantasy Legend, Final Fantasy Legend 2,
6876360	6880760	and Final Fantasy Legend 3. Then there was Romancing Saga, Romancing Saga 2, Romancing
6880760	6888040	Saga 3. Um, then there was Saga Frontier, Saga Frontier 2, and, uh, we got, uh, Unlimited Saga,
6888040	6893880	Emperor Saga, Imperial Saga, and Saga Scarlet Grace. And there was the Legend of Legacy and the
6893880	6898520	Alliance Alive. So those are the things that came out with the Saga series.
6899080	6905640	Really has its own amount of following, maybe not as much as the Final Fantasy ones, but it was
6905640	6911320	pretty good. All right. And now they're talking about Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. Yeah. I see
6911320	6916200	that in chat talking about that. All right. Well, there it is your classic game of the week,
6916200	6923080	Romancing Saga for the Super Famicom. I have to say that instead of Super Nintendo because, uh,
6923080	6927240	well, we never really got it. Oops, got the wrong shot there. We never really got it on the, uh,
6927240	6933800	Super Nintendo. So, all right. Well, that is going to do it for Dark Sakura tonight because
6933800	6938680	I know we only wrote you in for half show because you are, you are sick. So, um, please feel better.
6938680	6943640	I mean, I haven't, you heard my voice cutting out. Yeah. We can hear it starting to go. So rest up,
6943640	6949240	feel better. I know all the chat, um, is, uh, sending you good vibes to heal up soon and all
6949240	6956440	that good stuff. I actually see me unmade for once. Yeah. I'm in my, but I have a new webcam
6956440	6960680	that honestly, I think it's got some problems. I mean, I didn't pay much for it, but better than
6960680	6964040	my old one. I think it's better than your old one. Yeah. It's a different angle tonight. It's good.
6964040	6968440	So I'm looking for, I, but I will say when you are feeling better, I am looking forward to the
6968440	6973720	return of the wigs. Not that your natural hair isn't beautiful, but we do. This ain't natural.
6973720	6978760	There's nothing natural about this color. We do love a good wig. All right. We love a wig.
6979240	6982760	Before I let you go to our soccer, any final thoughts or last words for our listeners tonight?
6983560	6988840	I'm coming to your house right now for a stroke. Oh, um, I do have my thoughts. I,
6988840	6992840	I know that there's not going to be much time by the time the podcast gets released,
6992840	7001320	but go out and vote, do it and, um, be safe when you do it. Wear your mask. We are coming into
7001320	7010280	the third wave of coronavirus. Um, and gen X, geeks.com, G E X. Oh, one last thing. Yeah. I
7010280	7019000	was on the last episode of, am I mental? Oh yes. Yes. We had Eon. Their show can be about one hour.
7019000	7025240	They have a hard cut at three. We hit the hard cut without noticing. Wow. All right. Two hours.
7025240	7031800	Sorry. So yeah. Um, I brought a little OLR randomness. It happens. All right. Yeah.
7031800	7036280	Go check it out. You get to hear me talk about how fucked up my brain is. I got to check that
7036280	7040360	out. Just be not, you know, like, but I'm just, I bet it was a good show. I bet it was a good
7040360	7044760	discussion. A lot of it, Rob. Yeah. I mean, I'm not tuning in to hear that. I just, you know,
7044760	7050040	I'm curious to hear, you know, the discussion we talked about supernatural hot too. Well,
7050040	7053240	I can get that without just talking to you on text message. All right.
7054200	7058040	All right. Well, Hey, my, my, my love to you guys, my love to the listeners,
7059000	7063560	pet all the cats and harass all the children. All right. Will do. Have a good night.
7065160	7070120	Look, you tell Nellie I owe her cookies. Bye. All right. Bye. Take care. All right. We'll do.
7070120	7076760	All right. We'll fix up the camera shot there and we will move on to talking about some rapid
7076760	7082920	fire news and traveling around the industry with some quick headlines. Loki. Yes. So we've found
7082920	7087960	out what the new games for this month are going to be for free that your games with gold, if you
7087960	7097080	will, on the Xbox side of things, we have a looks like Aragami shadow edition and swim sanity.
7097080	7105720	Those are both Xbox one and then Xbox compatible games we have looks like full spectrum warrior,
7105720	7111800	which is actually an original Xbox game and Indiana Jones or Lego, Indiana Jones
7112840	7120200	or the Xbox three 60. So, uh, interesting. And then great titles with the new console coming
7120200	7125480	out. Sorry, but they're not, but I, you know, it's so hard now because of game. Exactly.
7125480	7131880	It's so hard because of game pass. Like. Exactly. Like I'm not disappointed because I have game pass.
7132840	7137240	But yeah, no, I mean, you, you do have to look at what's going on with Sony, which, you know,
7137240	7142680	you'll get to and it's, it's a different story. So Sony's got some more exciting stuff. So for
7142680	7149160	example, they have hollow Knight Boyd heart edition and middle earth shadow of war. That's on
7149880	7156360	on PlayStation four. Um, also if you're a PlayStation five owner, you get bug snacks.
7157160	7161080	That's huge. Those are. Yeah. And that's going to be available for two months as well,
7161080	7165160	much like the other game on PlayStation five that they were offering for two months,
7165160	7171080	uh, next year. So this is from November 12th through January 4th. You can pick up bug snacks.
7171080	7176440	I'm wondering since I don't own a PlayStation five, if it's one of those things where I can
7176440	7182280	kind of add it to my library type of thing. So I used to do that with Xbox one games back when I
7182280	7187880	still had a third Xbox or Sony's going to be complete dicks about it and just say, no, sorry,
7187880	7193640	you didn't register PlayStation five of those. Uh, okay. I've got to be lucky to be fair. That's
7193640	7197960	not them being dicks. That's just business, you know, by a PlayStation five. It's a little,
7197960	7202760	it's a little bit being a dick, but no, no, no, no. It is though, because I'm paying for their
7202760	7207160	PlayStation plus service. So I should be entitled to the games that they're offering for free.
7207160	7211080	It shouldn't be a caveat that, Oh, well, I'm sorry. You got to also purchase a PlayStation
7211080	7214920	five right now. Cause that wasn't the way it used to be with other systems. All right. I'll give you
7214920	7218760	that. But we don't know to me, but we don't know if we'll be able to redeem it or not yet. Yeah.
7218760	7223400	Anyways. But they are very explicit that it is only the PlayStation five version of bug snacks
7223400	7227720	that we do know. You can't hit that and then get it on your PlayStation four that you can't do.
7227720	7233480	We know that. Yeah. So you, you will get it a PlayStation five copy in your library if you will.
7233480	7239800	Um, so yeah, I'll go ahead and try to do that. But I like, I finally was able to redeem the
7239800	7245240	October ones. I could not get their online site to work correctly. It would not detect that I have
7245240	7250440	PlayStation plus, even though I very much do have PlayStation plus I have a boot up my PlayStation
7250440	7254920	four to actually go download them. There's a very easy new method to try that I will talk about
7254920	7260520	later wink. Yeah. Look at the show roll what's coming up and that's how I did it. And it's,
7260520	7267160	it's easy. All right. And then on top of that, um, we talked about last week, how call of duty was
7267160	7275640	reducing the file size of modern warfare, um, to allow it to be, you know, more digestible,
7277000	7284040	but, uh, the new call of duty black, um, cold war, uh, black ops, cold war, it's going to be
7284040	7293640	250 gigabytes on PC, which is enormous. Oh my God. So apparently though they have a non 4k
7293640	7300440	install, which brings it down to one 75 gigabytes or a multiplayer only client, which is only 50
7300440	7308360	gigabytes, but Jesus says ridiculous. Wow. Hopefully the console version isn't, isn't as big
7308360	7313640	because I mean, the day one batch, that's the whole game. We'll look at like play, look at a
7313640	7317640	PlayStation five. I think the usable hard drive space on that. It's like only 700 megabytes. So
7317640	7323000	you're talking about third of the hard drive used up for one game. That's so stupid. Um,
7323000	7327160	Bobby black Wolf and chat says, remember data caps in many areas are only 1.2 terabytes.
7327160	7330920	So that's almost one fifth of a monthly data cap. And yeah, I'm, I'm getting to the point where
7330920	7337240	those data caps are really getting to be a concern. We hit like 980 gigs, like within the
7337240	7344120	past month, but it's because, um, without getting into it, like basically like somebody would leave
7344120	7350520	Twitch streams running and not be there watching them for a couple of hours. Um, and you know,
7350520	7356840	I was like, we got, but you know, I understand like, I'm sympathetic to this because how often
7356840	7362280	have we had the TV on in the background and just had it running and it's background noise. Shit.
7362280	7367560	My TV came with an ambient mode that that is its purpose is to just be on in the background kind
7367560	7372680	of running. So that's kind of like what we've kind of instilled with our motions, but now it's like,
7372680	7378600	Oh crap, I can't do that with a constantly downloading stream or something because
7378600	7383400	I might hit a bandwidth cap. Like, and that's, it's crazy that that's the thing we have to
7383400	7388840	worry about right now. I really hope these companies kind of evaluate that stuff. So yes,
7388840	7393320	Bobby Blackwell says Smush needs to close his Twitch streams. Yes, he does. Yes, he does.
7393960	7400040	So, all right. And no one special Twitch streams. Did I, I don't think, I don't think I said the
7400040	7406440	other thing you're hinting at there. All right. Anyway, let's move on. Um, so, uh, let's talk
7406440	7410760	about N7 Day cause that's going to be this week. And of course, if you're a fan of Mass Effect,
7410760	7417320	then you know that November 7th or N7 is kind of a big deal. Um, and you know, N7 Day never went
7417320	7421880	away. It's always kind of an annual celebration of Mass Effect, although I feel like they do some
7421880	7428040	bigger things one years than others, but, uh, what's happening, uh, Marc Meer actually said,
7428040	7433640	uh, over the weekend that he's going to be doing a, or joining an N7 Day stream that's taking place
7433640	7440120	on November 7th at 11 AM Pacific. And it's not just going to be him. Jennifer Hale will be there
7440120	7445640	too. So if you're male Shep or female Shep, guess what? They will both be there. And the voice actors
7445640	7453960	for Caden, Liara, Jack, Grunt, Ashley, Samantha trainer, Morden and Legion are all going to be
7453960	7460360	there. Now, something interesting I noticed about that list. It's all characters from the original
7460360	7466440	trilogy and none from Andromeda. Now, I said I wasn't going to talk about that game until
7466440	7473720	they officially announce it, but if I were going to finally, finally fucking announce that game,
7474520	7477800	this might be the group of people I want to get together on a Zoom call to do it.
7478520	7482680	Probably. Didn't we have it rumored that it was supposed to be still coming out like, uh,
7482680	7489320	like trademarks or something or, uh, ESRV ratings? You know what, Loki? I'm not going to talk about
7489320	7497640	it. You know, sorry. You know how I feel. It'll happen when it happens. But I,
7499480	7503960	let me just put it this way. If they don't say anything at this November 7th thing,
7504600	7510280	then like, I am so done. I am so, I can't even. Wouldn't it make more sense for those remakes to
7510280	7514840	come out on the brand new systems that they're releasing just now versus like the current
7514840	7519080	systems? Wouldn't you think that that might be why they're waiting a little bit? And I'd
7519080	7524600	be okay with that. And that Loki, that's a very logical answer. Um, and I am all about that
7524600	7532600	answer if that is the case. Yes. We'll see. All right. Anyhow. Uh, other, one other story here.
7532600	7538440	Oh yes. Wizardry. I don't know if y'all know about the wizardry series, but this, this goes way back
7538440	7543720	in gaming's history, right? The classic classic games wizardry. Um, well, a Japanese company
7543720	7550520	named DRECOM has just picked up the copyright domestic foreign trademark rights to wizardry.
7550520	7555720	And that means they now have the copyrights to wizardry six, seven and eight and wizardry gold.
7555720	7561320	And they basically have the trademark over that name. This company is saying they will, uh, keep
7561320	7565320	their commitment to the acquisition of popular intellectual properties and the development and
7565320	7572200	cultivation of the internal properties. Here's the downside. DRECOM is a mobile game developer
7572280	7577400	and they're based out of Tokyo. Uh, now they've worked on cool stuff like Disgaea, RPG,
7577400	7583640	everybody's golf, the mobile version. So, you know, there's the, it's not all bad news. Um,
7583640	7589080	but that's where the wizardry stuff is right now. So maybe, maybe Loki, they'll make something that
7589080	7597880	will be for Facebook gaming cloud service. Oh, check out that wizardry I'm showing. All right.
7598520	7603000	That's it for rapid fire news. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates. I
7603000	7606680	know we're getting into that time of year where there's going to be a lot, right? Loki.
7607400	7612520	Um, not so much this week because they're saving it all for next week. Um, this week we've got,
7612520	7619240	uh, Bakugan champions of Astoria that's on Nintendo switch, uh, Jurassic world evolution
7619240	7626040	complete edition on Nintendo switch, uh, sold near X two of final prototype definitive edition

7639160	7644680	hot pursuit remastered on PC PlayStation four and X-Box one. And last but not least
7644680	7649480	tropical six on Nintendo switch. That's it. All right. Well, Japan has, uh, quite a few
7649480	7653640	releases this week compared to other weeks on the Nintendo switch this week. Uh, we have
7653640	7659960	alpaca ball all stars is out this week. And I'm wondering if, I'm wondering if that is actually
7659960	7668920	some type of game that stars alpacas that you actually like. Oh my God, it is fabulous. I am
7668920	7674520	all about that. Uh, and it looks like that game's coming out in Europe as well at some point. So
7674520	7678600	I'm sure we'll get it here. We'll see. Um, other games coming out in Japan, construction simulator
7678600	7683960	two and three on the switch. Uh, we also have real time battle Shogi online, um,
7683960	7691320	Ochi de Rilakkuma, uh, Rilakkuma ga Ochi ni Yatakita comes out this week. Uh, we also have
7691320	7696520	shadow verse champions battle and a game called Mary Skelter finale. And I was like,
7696520	7701080	what the hell is this game? Check out this description. You ready? Mary Skelter finale
7701080	7706280	is the latest series that depicts the end of jailbreak drama that revealed through Mary
7706280	7710120	Skelter nightmares, Mary Skelter two and the Mary Skelter short stories.
7710120	7715000	The protagonist who is trapped in jail with a living prison full of strings,
7715000	7721960	monsters called Martians aims to escape with the help of blood maidens who possess a special power
7721960	7726520	and judging from the special art book, the blood maidens are sexy maidens.
7727480	7733800	So, I mean, aren't they all, I would hope so. All right. Happy Halloween. A little late. Anyway,
7733800	7739400	on the PlayStation four that Mary Skelter finale games also out there, as well as ACE combat seven,
7739400	7743480	getting a price reduction and, uh, that's it. So it's a little more exciting on the switch this
7743480	7749560	week. Um, how about the UK Loki since, uh, dark soccer took off. So yeah, in the UK, we've got,
7749560	7754760	uh, the walking dead saints and sinners, the complete collection on PlayStation four,

7781320	7785640	both a sword and shield that they're doing that. And those are both on the switch. Of course,

7855160	7861880	where our chat goes the extra mile at depth in chat says, uh, or gave a link alpaca ball
7861880	7868440	all stars is on steam right now. So you don't have to be in Japan to play alpaca ball unless
7868440	7872760	you want to play it on switch, I guess, uh, in Japan. Uh, but you can get it on steam right now.
7872760	7877080	And, uh, active to say it is, it is what you think it's alpacas playing soccer best game ever.
7878200	7883160	I mean, what, what more do you need? I like, I like a game. That's honest. You know,
7883560	7889720	I don't like a game where the title doesn't make sense and it's vague. And what does it mean?
7890280	7895480	I'd like a game that just puts it all on the table. You know, this is what it is.
7895480	7903080	Take it or leave it. All right. This is an alpaca and it's playing soccer. Exactly.
7904600	7909400	Uh, vidpower 573 in chat says alpaca ball goes great with goat of duty.
7910040	7916920	What about goat simulator? All right. Go to duty is a little different. It's more of just,
7916920	7922280	it was kind of, uh, joking off of goat simulator and then, um, call it duty. So
7924200	7929080	I don't know. It was free for a while ago. That's just J 100. Matt says if 2020 continues to go
7929080	7936680	south, at least we have this. That's right. 2020 the year of COVID pandemic and well,
7936680	7943880	Hey, at least there was a packable moving on. You guys are killing me. Moving on. Let's get
7943880	7950360	to the next story. Uh, Oh, everyone's talking about this, right? Logan. Yeah. So, uh, fortunately
7950360	7957880	we, we got the news and even though games have gone gold, like cyberpunk 2077, apparently going
7957880	7962680	gold does not mean that it's still not going to be delayed again. And that's what happened. So,
7963560	7970440	they had put out a message on Twitter saying that, you know, we were sorry, but unfortunately we need
7970440	7975640	additional time to work on that. That ominous black text on a yellow background. That's starting
7975640	7981160	to look like the fucking BBC breaking news alert logo. Like when you, when you see it pop up on
7981160	7989880	your Twitter feed, you're like, Oh, what now? Right. It's currently been delayed to December
7989880	7996760	7th or I'm sorry, December 10th. I say currently, because I have a feeling that's going to be
7996760	8008520	delayed again. And if you want to believe anonymous posts on Twitter, then according to an anonymous
8008520	8015240	insider that works at CG product, read about four to five months worth of time to work on the game.
8015320	8022440	So whatever at this point, like I, I don't, so they're working on the day one patch stuff
8022440	8029560	right now. Obviously I don't see how it gets delayed that much because the game went gold,
8029560	8036920	right? And they're already pressing the disks, right? So three weeks to make a patch that fixes
8036920	8041720	some pretty major issues, I guess makes sense, even though technically there's going to be
8041720	8045160	people who can't download that patch right away. So that disc needs to be able to like,
8045160	8050760	kind of play the game, but delaying it all the way to March for a day one patch, that just seems
8050760	8055960	a little, I don't know. But again, you, you, you said the source, so take it or leave it is a
8055960	8062680	forum post. So, you know, take it or leave it. That would just be very surprising. That's all
8062680	8067400	I'm going to say. And look, I've heard all that. I get it. I get it. And I usually game delays are
8067400	8072280	fine because I get it. A good game is a bad game is a bad game forever. Blah, blah, blah. Said
8072280	8077320	Miyamoto. Nobody will remember the delay, which or three was delayed a ton of times. Who cares
8077320	8081320	at this point? Yes, yes, yes. I get it. And I support all of that. And yes, if the game
8081320	8087480	isn't ready, then fucking delay it. I get it. However, the sheer number of times it's had to
8087480	8093080	be delayed. And then on top of that, a three week delay, like a little baby step delay.
8093080	8097320	There's something about those little, like, you know, bumblebee looking announcements on
8097320	8102040	the cyberpunk Twitter that are just starting to become self parody in a way. You know what I mean?
8102040	8107000	It's like, and they are, in fact, a bunch of people were parodying to make all sorts of
8107000	8111640	announcements. Where is your project management? Like, how have you guys missed the day so many
8111640	8119640	times? Well, I'm okay. You know what? Pandemic. Everybody's working from home. Not everybody was
8119640	8126200	prepared for that. I do get it. But you know, you just can't help. But that was the September to
8126200	8131800	November delay. So what about the rest of the time? You can't help, but just feels a little
8131800	8138520	bit of like, Oh my God, what is what is going on over there? But hey, look, if the game comes out,
8138520	8142360	and it kicks all sort of asses every, you know, everybody's setting the bar pretty fucking high
8142360	8147400	for this game. So I mean, that's that act. I see that as a problem in some ways. Maybe the delays
8147400	8151400	are to help lower the bar. I don't know. But people are setting the bar pretty fucking high
8151400	8157000	for this game. So hopefully it delivers. And you know, people, you're right, like The Witcher 3,
8157000	8160920	nobody's gonna care about the delay at the end of the day. But, and I brought this up on Bobby's
8160920	8165000	show before we went live tonight, one interesting thing about even a three week delay is that now
8165000	8169400	this game is no longer going to be eligible for the Game Awards this year. Because Game Awards
8169400	8173640	eligibility, if I remember right, based on last year, runs through the last week in November. It
8173640	8178520	may not be exactly November 30. But it's around that like, black, sorry, something just fell over
8178520	8183720	in studio. It's around that Black Friday timeline. So by bumping into December, they're gonna miss
8183720	8189240	it. So now it's not going to be eligible for Game of the Year. And it's gonna have to be one of
8189240	8195320	those games that you kind of remember deep into 2021 against whatever else comes out next year.
8195320	8202600	And you know, you might have some big, you know, like, Horizon Forbidden West, or maybe even the
8202600	8206920	Ragnarok game are going to be out on PlayStation 5. Microsoft will finally get Halo out and
8206920	8210200	whatever other big titles they have, you know, there's gonna be some pretty whopper titles next
8210200	8215240	year. So Cyberpunk is gonna have to compete against all that as opposed to this year where
8216280	8220920	Nintendo isn't putting out a lot this holiday. Animal Crossing is likely to be a Game of the
8220920	8224760	Year nominee just because of what it, you know, kind of represents with the pandemic and everything.
8224760	8230600	And Final Fantasy 7 Remake will probably get a nomination. And I'm not saying, I think Hades
8230600	8234120	really stands a shot at getting a nomination. At least I hope it does. It does in my heart.
8234680	8240280	But I feel like this is like an, and it's not what the quality of games this year has been bad.
8240280	8246600	But I think just by nature, because it has been in a technological sense, the lame duck year before
8246600	8250680	the new consoles, and then the pandemic on top of that, I mean, look at the pandemic did in the
8250680	8255800	movie industry, right? Like the Oscars next year. Like, what are the Oscars gonna look like next
8255800	8260920	year? They're combining like, isn't it like 15 months of movies or something? It's gonna be weird.
8262920	8270920	So, it's gonna be interesting to see what that does to award season and so forth and what game
8270920	8278120	actually does win the game awards. So, SSG100Matt in chat says, I'm fine with the delay. All kidding
8278120	8282120	aside, I personally don't have the time to play right now. I just moved and I don't even have a
8282120	8289960	console set up. Do you think, Loki, if they were to do a bigger delay into March, and that's a big
8289960	8294920	if, okay? I'm gonna play the tin foil hat game just because we have the time to do that on a
8294920	8300760	three-hour show. To play the tin foil hat game, if they do bump it to March, you had just mentioned
8300760	8305160	about Mass Effect. Wouldn't you rather they delay it to make it even better on the new systems?
8305160	8312040	Do you think bumping it to March may be because they're going to jazz it up, zhuzh it up for the
8312040	8315720	new systems even more than they'd planned? They were already gonna do that, though. They were
8315720	8322120	already delaying the next-gen versions until March, so they were already planning. Isn't that the problem?
8322920	8328120	Didn't they say that in their last release? They have, yeah, but they have nine versions to work on
8328120	8333080	excluding the two next-gen versions. They have the versions, basically, so they have the, you know,
8333080	8340760	PlayStation 4, PC. They have, you know, the PlayStation 4 Pro, PlayStation 5 backwards
8340760	8347400	compatibility, Xbox One, Xbox Series X backwards compatibility, Xbox Series S backwards
8347400	8354440	compatibility. I'm not sure what all the other ones were, but it's a lot of stuff that they have
8354440	8358680	to test to see if it's going to be working correctly, and
8361080	8365560	I don't know. That's excluding the other versions, though. Oh, and I'm sorry, Stadia.
8365560	8373640	How could I forget Stadia? Well, it's easy. Facebook Gaming. I don't see Facebook Gaming on there,
8374200	8379880	so that's a plus. Clearly, it's not a real game. All right, let's move on. Loki, I mentioned earlier
8379880	8384440	in the show about another way to get your PlayStation Plus games, and that is through
8384440	8391000	the brand new PlayStation app. So, Sony actually updated the PlayStation app, which is to match
8391560	8398360	the re-look of the PlayStation 5 and so forth, and so far, the new app seems to be doing better than
8398360	8402040	the new store did when we were talking about that last week, where it was like, where is the title
8402040	8405640	of the games? But I will say, if you check out, are you looking down right now because you're
8405640	8409880	downloading the app? I'm looking at my PlayStation. I already have a PlayStation app.
8411400	8414840	Look, I have to look at my phone during the show sometimes, too. That's too funny a time
8414840	8420040	that I'm talking about that, and suddenly you're looking down. Well, I want to see if it looks
8420040	8424440	right. And see if you can redeem your PlayStation Plus game and see if it's a little easier. Oh,
8424440	8430440	wait, you already did. I already did, yeah. All right. Well, anyway, so you can go into that,
8430440	8435000	and what's neat about it is that you'll be able to actually manage your PlayStation 5
8435000	8442120	storage through the app as well, which I believe Xbox Game Pass app allows you to do that a little
8442120	8448360	bit, too. So it's nice that Sony is joining that, too, where you can kind of mobile manage it,
8448360	8451800	especially when you're talking about downloading big games. And I think that's why it's important
8451800	8455960	to be able to connect to your system and kind of manage some of the big, big, especially if you got
8455960	8463720	like 250 gigs filled up by Go to Duty or whatever, then you got to delete some stuff to make room
8463720	8470200	sometimes. So anyway, the app was updated this last week. It was updated on iOS and Android.
8470200	8474120	There's now a home screen, and you have friends on there and recently played games. The app used
8474120	8479880	to be split. There was a messaging app, and thank God somebody figured out that was a terrible idea,
8479880	8483480	and they homogenized that into the one app. So if you have the standalone messaging app,
8483480	8488280	you can get rid of it. The main app will show you your friends list, let you chat with those people.
8488360	8496200	Messages is in there as well. And that's pretty cool. You can also, through the app, voice chat
8496200	8500520	with friends on their PlayStation. So that's something they're kind of bridging the gap with
8500520	8505080	as well. Whereas like, you know, on Nintendo, the only voice chat is through the app. And I don't
8505080	8511400	think Microsoft really has that right now, where you can chat through the app with people in the
8511400	8516040	game. It could be wrong. Good, because it's a terrible idea, unless you're not like playing
8516040	8520840	with people and you just want to chat with some random person that has a PlayStation account,
8520840	8524600	but they're not playing games. You could just like call them on the phone,
8525720	8533880	or FaceTime or whatever. Use my phone for phone things? No. Or, you know, Discord's the thing,
8533880	8539240	I guess. Yeah. Discord's the big one now too. That's a lot. Like, you know, I play games with
8539240	8544360	people. We just hang on Discord. So there's been nights where like, I'm playing something,
8544360	8547400	my friend's playing something else, and we're still just chatting on Discord. You know,
8547400	8554120	whatever. So anyway. Also, the store. You know, the store is integrated into the app,
8554120	8557560	because that's the real money maker. So because the app doesn't cost you anything,
8557560	8561160	but if you want to buy stuff through the store, that will do it. But you can also, again,
8561160	8565400	manage that remotely. So that's pretty cool. I'm glad to hear the app is getting an update.
8565400	8569400	I'm very glad to hear it's not two separate apps anymore. And again, I went in there and
8569400	8573880	used the app a little bit and it was good. I was able to redeem my game. So try that next month,
8573880	8578600	Loki. I will try that next month since their website sucks. All right. So bad. Maybe they'll
8578600	8583400	fix the website by next month, but we'll see. All right. I got another story for you guys,
8583400	8588760	and it's about Netflix. I know a lot of you guys are, you know, streaming and watching all that.
8588760	8594280	And we know that there's a lot of video game related projects in the works at Netflix right
8594280	8600920	now. But let me take a moment to tell you just how many there are. There are 10 different projects
8600920	8608440	in the works right now at Netflix. And this list doesn't even have The Witcher, apparently. The
8608440	8613640	Witcher Blood Origin, I guess, is the new... I'm sorry. The Witcher Blood Origin is the prequel
8613640	8619640	series. So that is on the list. But The Witcher season two is not on this list I'm about to read
8619640	8623800	here. So there's two Witcher shows right now. Although yes, if you want to get technical,
8623800	8629400	The Witcher is based on a book. But we all know the game helped and the game set our expectations
8629400	8635320	of what the show would actually look like. What else is in the works? Resident Evil,
8635320	8641400	a live action series. Resident Evil Infinite Darkness, a animated series. Assassin's Creed,
8641400	8648680	a live series. Cyberpunk Edgerunners, an animated series. Splinter Cell, an animated series. The
8648680	8656840	Division, a live movie. Devil May Cry, an animated series. Final Fantasy, a live series. I keep
8656840	8661800	forgetting that is in development. It's actually... This list doesn't say it's Final Fantasy 14,
8661800	8665880	but it is. Not something because it's the same people that did The Witcher that are working on
8665880	8671720	it. And The Cuphead Show, an animated series. All of that being worked on right now. And
8671720	8676760	Castlevania is getting a fourth season. Dragon's Dogma just came out within this last month,
8676760	8682280	that animated series. So Netflix is like the home of video game adaptations right now. It's
8682280	8691320	pretty crazy. But that's good. What do you think about all these video game projects on... This
8691320	8695800	doesn't even count what's already out there, like the Ingress anime, although I doubt they're doing
8695800	8699800	another season of that. Or some of the other stuff that's out there. It's just kind of neat.
8701880	8705800	I probably won't get around to watching it. I still haven't watched any of The Witcher or
8706440	8711240	Castlevania, even though I hear those are really good. I did, unfortunately,
8711240	8719000	try watching the Ingress anime and that was not very good. I don't know. Maybe I'll check out
8719000	8727800	one of them. Maybe the live action Final Fantasy 14 would be interesting. We'll see. I have to run
8727800	8734600	out of things to watch. Questbuster in chat says, the Dragon's Dogma one isn't bad. So there's that.
8734600	8740520	SG100Matt says, hope they all don't suck. All right. I think they're pretty good so far. I
8740520	8745960	don't think that there's a lot that have been really terrible. The only thing that makes
8745960	8751560	Ingress the anime bad is the same thing that makes Ingress bad. And that's the storyline's
8751560	8755800	too convoluted and doesn't make any sense. Who plays for the story?
8756600	8760760	I will cry. I understand that. But why make an anime if the story is not compelling?
8761720	8768760	I don't know. It's just not very good. But that's the fault of the source material. Not so much
8768760	8775960	that the people aren't talented enough to make it into a series. All right. Well, let's move on.
8776520	8779400	Loki, we have a couple more stories before we get to the listener roundtable. Loki.
8780520	8784360	People need to leave Sakurai alone. I mean, he's just a perfectionist. A little too much
8784360	8791960	of a perfectionist, though, because his original scope for the adding Steve and the Minecraft
8791960	8798200	characters to Smash Ultimate was he wanted to allow players to create their own Minecraft
8798200	8803480	levels and be able to import them into Smash. That's crazy. Obviously. Obviously, that was not
8804360	8809640	something that was implemented. Welcome to my Minecraft level dungeon of dicks.
8809640	8813080	Because you know, that's what they would have done.
8814120	8819160	It was too difficult in development to get it working. And so he just didn't end up having
8819160	8826920	something, you know, like that implemented. But. I mean, it's fine that Sakurai opted to take a nap
8827800	8831400	and he earned it, so leave him alone. Like, I could do all this extra stuff
8831400	8835400	or it could take a nap and nap is probably a better thing. Honestly,
8835400	8837640	he earned it. Don't give him shit. I will fight you.
8840600	8844760	All right. So can you imagine what that would have looked like if actual Minecraft was?
8844760	8847320	I think that was just a bad idea to begin with, because, you know,
8847320	8853160	people are going to do Booby Stadium, Dungeon of Dicks, you name it, somebody's going to do it.
8853160	8858920	So it's probably for the best that they didn't, you know, didn't do it. All right.
8858920	8864920	Yeah. Moving on. This is a this is a nice one to end the show on a little bit. We still have
8864920	8871080	Listener Roundtable coming up. But for our last news story here, the PlayStation 2 is celebrating
8871080	8877880	an anniversary. That's right. The PlayStation 2 is 20 years old this week. The PlayStation 2
8877880	8882840	came out 20 years ago in North America. So I know some of you want to get technical with the
8882840	8887560	Japanese release and all that good stuff. But obviously, a lot of people looking back fondly
8887560	8892280	on the PlayStation 2 as one of the greatest consoles of all time. You know, yes, even
8892280	8897240	counting Super Nintendo and Dreamcast and all your other faves. You know, PlayStation 2 brought
8897240	8901800	us a lot of huge series when we talk about things like God of War, you know, just how Metal Gear
8901800	8905640	Solid, although, yes, the original was on the PlayStation, the sequels really upped the game
8906440	8912520	and so on. Like, was there a game that just really defined the PlayStation 2 for you, Loki?
8912520	8925400	I mean, a lot of like Grand Theft Auto 3 and 4, or I'm sorry, 3 and Vice City, San Andreas.
8925400	8930600	I mean, those are pretty big. Dance Dance Revolution, a lot of the games we played on there.
8930600	8936520	Honestly, BeatMania 2DX, even though that was in Japan. Like for me, those games really defined
8936520	8941560	that era and like why I had a Japanese PlayStation 2 before I had an American one because of that.
8941560	8947720	A lot of like the early stuff I want to say, because, you know, back the PlayStation was also,
8948680	8955560	well, I didn't have Final Fantasy XI on it, but I did have the HD loader, so that was fun,
8955560	8960840	you know, loading games on with that. Oh, yes. Here's some answers from chat. Bobby Blackwolf
8960840	8968920	says Kadamari Damacy. W04 says all the Clover Studio games were mint. Vidpower says PlayStation
8968920	8975960	2 was a great console and a great DVD player. That's very true. That is why that thing sold
8975960	8981640	buku bananas because, you know, putting the DVD stuff in there was a great idea. Sacred Jade says
8981640	8991400	Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance and Deception. So, yes. And Magic Pen Gel from me. That was a
8991400	8996680	PlayStation 2 all time great. Although, you know, I've always been a sucker for Final Fantasy games.
8996680	9003240	So, I mean, Final Fantasy X was huge. XII was great. And, of course, XI online. PlayStation 2,
9003240	9007880	that game was made for PlayStation 2, really. The PC was kind of secondary. By the time we got it
9007880	9012120	in the US, we got it with the first expansion. That game was really made for the PlayStation 2
9012120	9017560	in Japan. So, that's a big one too. Some other music games coming in from Bobby saying Mad
9017560	9023880	Maestro and Guitar Man. So, yeah. Good answers, guys. Good answers. So, looking back on the
9023880	9030760	PlayStation 2 and yes, you're old because the PlayStation 2 just turned 20. Now, how old are
9030760	9037000	you? How old were you when you got a PlayStation 2? Add 20 to it. All right. You're welcome.
9037880	9045080	Let's move on to the listener roundtable. If you have questions in chat or comments or think
9045080	9049400	probably going to be cursing me out after what I just said. But things you want to talk about here
9049400	9053640	on air, please, by all means, leave those questions and comments in chat. I'll get to as many of those
9053640	9059960	as I can. But as part of the roundtable, I also want to get to the mailbag. So, let's get to the
9059960	9065720	mailbag tonight. And we do have a couple of emails tonight here. And first, I want to mention this
9065720	9071720	because Bobby can't resist a cheap plug here. But it's a good plug and I will allow it. Saying,
9071720	9077320	thing you're looking forward to in Awesome Games Done Quick, where do we mention on last week's
9077320	9082120	show? I thought we did. If we didn't, then I'll say it. Bobby is going to be a full host for the
9082120	9089640	next one. He was a pinch hitter host on the Summer Games event. And he did one hosting stint on the
9089640	9095240	Devil May Cry 4 speed run. But he's going to get a full shift this time. He's going to be doing
9095240	9101240	multiple games for Awesome Games. That's great. Congrats, Bobby. And yes, I did look at the list
9101240	9105800	earlier this week. And the thing that caught my eye that I hope Bobby gets to voice, although I'm
9105800	9112360	sure lots of people will be wanting to do it, is the Beat Saber Showcase in VR. Even though I know
9112360	9119480	Bobby doesn't like those super crazy hard levels, but I think if somebody else is doing it and is
9119480	9125080	doing it very well, it'll be an awesome thing to kind of look at, watch and talk about. So, for me,
9125080	9129000	that Beat Saber expert thing definitely caught my eye. And I hope they don't put that three o'clock
9129000	9133640	in the morning my time. I hope it is a primetime event that I'll be able to watch. I also think it's
9133640	9137880	interesting they have things like BPM, Bullets Per Minute, where that's like a very recent game.
9137880	9143400	Although, I mean, the game's done quick event, they put out new games are in it all the time.
9143400	9147560	So that's pretty cool. I don't know if you got a chance to look at the list, Loki, but is there
9147560	9151960	any speed run you're looking forward to? I'm looking at it right now. The Diablo 3 one caught
9151960	9158600	my eye too, because Diablo 3 is very random in many ways. Like the maps can be very random. So
9158600	9165880	I'm kind of curious about the speed run strategy. I imagine there's certain ways you can kind of
9165880	9174040	tell the seed and things like that. So I'm curious to how that'll work. Yeah, I don't know if there's
9174040	9180120	anything like I'm super hyped to see. I was hoping they'd have another Minecraft run, but they have
9180120	9184360	Minecraft Dungeons, which would be interesting. So I'll check that out. I like Minecraft Dungeons.
9184920	9189240	It's like an old school Diablo. Yeah, so that'd be interesting to see.
9192840	9200120	Yeah, I don't know. Does anyone run the Burger King games? Because I would really like to see
9200120	9205320	that. Loki, you're going to be the first. You need to work on that. No, I don't have them anymore. I
9205320	9210520	only have a Pocket Bike Racing, and that was literally the worst one of the bunch. I think I
9210520	9216040	have a copy of Sneak King still, and it should be backwards compatible. I don't know. I've never
9216040	9222760	tried. It should be, you know, because they have both the Xbox and Xbox 360 versions on the same
9222760	9227960	disk. Loki, Loki, hell with your game. To hell with your game. You need to be the world speed
9227960	9233000	run champion of Sneak King. No, I don't want to do that. It was funny though. Actually, I like
9233000	9240120	somebody I follow who's a game developer. This guy named Danny who streams a lot on, or he does a lot
9240120	9246440	of YouTube stuff, and he's actually been dedicating himself to try to become a Minecraft speedrunner.
9246440	9250520	I was like, yeah, you know, he could do it. I probably could do it too. I just still, so the
9250520	9256360	problem is I don't use mousey keyboard a lot for anything PC, so I'm already at a disadvantage
9256360	9262520	because I never was really kind of, I'm not used to using the mouse and keyboard, so I'd have to
9262520	9268760	get used to that, and that's a whole learning curve right there, but I like watching them.
9269480	9273640	All right, let's get to some emails. We did get some emails tonight. Participate
9273640	9279400	at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, and we're going to read some on the air. So we have Amish
9279400	9286040	with our first email tonight. Hello, hello. Saying, dear OLR, hi. Amish here, or Michikins on Twitch.
9286040	9289880	First and foremost, I'd like to ask you that you please excuse any spelling and grammar mistakes,
9289880	9296120	as my spelling and grammar are horrible. Well, lucky you got me tonight. Just teasing, maybe.
9296120	9301800	All right, so moving on. No worries. I have bad spelling and grammar because text messages have
9301800	9307800	ruined me, as I think they've ruined a lot of people. Anyway, now down to brass tacks. So
9307800	9313800	I've been watching the show since maybe early 2000-ish, and I have to say I am a long-time fan.
9313800	9319880	That is a very long time. So we started in the early 2000s, so thank you so much for being here
9319880	9324360	and being a part of it. Thank you, thank you. I may not always participate, but I do listen to
9324360	9329240	every show. I just wanted to let you know you are all doing a great job at uplifting every gamer's
9329240	9333800	voice and letting them be heard. That means a lot that somebody would call that out and acknowledge
9333800	9338600	that. So thank you very much, Amish. I appreciate that. I'm saying, continuing on with the email.
9338600	9343800	Anyway, what I was writing about was that recently you discussed inclusion of the disabled in games.
9344360	9349400	Well, recently I purchased Watch Dogs Legion and discovered they have closed captioning in the
9349400	9354760	game's menu. When you boot up the game, or is it load the game now? Yeah, I'm that old that I still
9354760	9361320	spell disc to mean disc and boot to mean load. Anyway, well, as long as you're not saying when I
9361320	9367400	load star comma eight comma one the game. That's an old C64 reference. I'll leave it at that. I
9367400	9371400	think people say boot load. I think we all know what you mean. So it's interchangeable, really.
9372760	9377960	It has the option to use captions and voice when playing the game. I thought that was really neat.
9377960	9383960	The game literally reads, that's the voice part, what's on the screen for the visually impaired.
9383960	9389160	That is really cool because I know we have folks who are visually impaired who have listened to
9389160	9394440	OLR in the past. I don't know if they're listening this week, but I know that type of accessibility
9394440	9400360	really allows them to play more games. And I am all about games are for everyone. So when a
9400360	9404920	developer takes the time to put that in their game, I think that means a lot to a lot of people.
9404920	9409640	So I think that's rad. And I'm glad you called that out so that, you know, if Watch Dogs Legion
9409640	9415160	maybe wasn't on your radar and maybe you have a disability that this could really help you,
9415880	9421400	we should put that game on people's radar. That's great. Meaning text and actions, which I think is
9421400	9426840	cool. Hopefully more games will include such info to help more and more disabled gamers out there.
9426840	9431560	Well, have a good day. Sincerely, Mish. Thank you so much for the email, Mish. Thank you for the
9431560	9437080	kind words about the show, of course. And thank you for the FYI that Watch Dogs Legion has some
9437080	9444920	pretty awesome accessibility issues. Really appreciate that. Cool, cool. And I gotta say,
9444920	9449720	you know what? Even when it comes to things like closed captioning, now I know that's different.
9449720	9453560	You were kind of talking about that there's like voices that'll narrate what's on screen,
9453560	9458360	kind of like, I don't know if you guys know this, but there will oftentimes be showings of movies
9458360	9463160	at the theater or like things you can get where there's like an extra like earpiece you can use
9463160	9467080	that if you are visually impaired will describe what's happening on the screen.
9467080	9470440	Cause like, you know, if there's, it's an action, if you're watching Fast and the Furious or
9470440	9477080	something, the dialogue in those movies is not exactly at shining point. So some say,
9477080	9484360	is it just like bananas, bananas, but like fiery car explosion. I haven't watched it. So I couldn't
9484360	9490040	tell you, but I think it does. I, you know, I don't want to poke fun at it because I think
9490040	9494360	it is a great thing that they're doing. Um, but you know, I think they do describe a little bit
9494360	9498040	more in detail what's going on. However, I will say that the reason why I brought it up, like
9498040	9505320	closed captions, like I, I am a fairly abled gamer where I don't necessarily need closed captions to
9505320	9511640	get through a game, but I like using them because what I do get is that I get really distracted by
9511640	9517400	background noise. And sometimes it's really hard for me to isolate of one voice when there's like
9517400	9521080	a lot of other stuff going on, like my brain kind of wants to go, well, what's that music? What's
9521080	9525560	this? You know, it's, it's kinda like, so when the closed captioning is on the screen, I can actually
9525560	9531160	kind of like focus on what the person is saying. And that I think is a great, and I will watch
9531160	9537640	movies with it. And I know some people hate it. Um, but like, if you've ever watched a foreign film,
9537640	9542120	you're reading that stuff anyway, which is silly. If you won't watch foreign movies, cause you have
9542120	9546280	to read subtitles, then you're missing the fuck out. Cause there's a lot of great stuff out there.
9546280	9551240	So, um, I will use closed captioning on, um, you know, English movies just so I can make sure I
9551240	9556520	don't miss things or a funny joke or things like that. Um, Bobby Blackwell says I watch Dr. Who
9556520	9562840	with closed captions because of the accents. Yeah. I mean, exactly. That's a good reason to,
9562920	9567480	uh, Questbuster says I grew up with sub-titled anime, so my eyes are ready.
9567480	9571880	And Questbuster also points out the first thing that Watchdogs Legion does is run you through
9571880	9576760	those accessibility options, which are pretty neat. Uh, Amish is in chat. Hey Amish, who says,
9576760	9579800	uh, Hey, yeah, I couldn't remember what it's called, but it literally tells you when the
9579800	9584840	game starts press X button. And I thought that was neat. I use captions myself because I'm visually
9584840	9591240	impaired somewhat. Uh, and they have that for Minecraft as well. W04 with a good comment too,
9591320	9595480	that closed captioning is a lifesaver when you have roommates. And that could go a variety of
9595480	9599320	ways because your roommates are being distracted in the background or like your roommates might be
9599320	9602520	on a different schedule and trying to sleep. So you're trying to watch a movie at a really
9602520	9608680	low volume. So yeah, a good call. So, uh, tiger con chat says my issues with movies with subtitles
9608680	9614840	is that it distracts me from actually seeing the visuals. Well, then you can, you know, they do
9614840	9619560	have dubs that are available if you want to do it that way. Sometimes it depends on the movie,
9619880	9625000	or turn closed captioning off, but I, what I like is that there's an option.
9626200	9631800	You can, you can do a tiger Claus way or you can do it my way. Like I think that option is great.
9631800	9637560	So, all right. Um, I will get to another email here, but Loki, did you want to chime in with any
9637560	9642600	last minute stories or anything here before I get to another email? Yeah. Since everyone was
9642600	9648360	memeing on the fact that the Xbox series X looks like a fridge, they went ahead and made it into
9648360	9654680	a fridge. So they're offering, well, they have three of them that were made three Xbox series X
9654680	9660520	fridges. Um, two, they gave to influencers one they're giving away. I thought it was funny
9660520	9664920	though, that they actually had a fridge that they made, or at least decked out one to look like a
9664920	9669800	Xbox series X. I think that's great. I love it. I wish I was Snoop dog. Cause he got one, right?
9671160	9677800	Yeah, he got one and I can't remember the tech. She's a tech streamer. She got one too. Uh,
9678600	9682920	I just seen, I think, um, and yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They're giving one away.
9683960	9690520	She was huge on Justin TV back in the day, if I remember right. So, uh, anyway, I,
9690520	9698760	damn, I wish we were popular Loki. I want an Xbox fridge. Eight or 18 years of anything, you know,
9698760	9704200	or, or was it, or is it one other one I was going to mention too. Uh, so they made the announcement,
9704200	9709800	the play date is almost done. It's going to be $149 and coming out early 2021. Yeah. And then I
9709800	9717720	saw, what was it? Uh, Danny over there at, uh, um, gamertag radio is like, Oh look, Hey, I got
9717720	9722120	this too. It's like, okay, listen, you've gotten enough free systems already in the last few days,
9722120	9727640	doing your photo shoots and all that. Cut it out. Don't hate on other people's success.
9727640	9731960	Don't hate, don't hate. I'm just joking. It's just funny though. Cause like, so here's my
9731960	9735960	glamour shoot out front of my apartment. Here's my glamour shoot in my apartment.
9735960	9739320	They made, he made a lot of content. They got it. They got their money's worth there. Yeah.
9740040	9744760	All right. Uh, let's see. Vid power and chat says, well, the Xbox series fridge be worth a
9744760	9749320	lot of money in the distant future due to its rarity. Why would you ever sell it? If you were
9749320	9754600	Snoop Dogg or I Justine, why would you ever sell it? I'd use it. Come on Microsoft. We're looking
9754600	9758360	at getting a new house. I want a new fridge. All right. And I would love my fridge to grow,
9758360	9762120	glow green like that. Like I know a lot of people associate green with the fridge and like,
9762120	9766520	Oh, it's moldy or something. But no, I think, I think an Xbox would give the kitchen a nice
9766520	9771320	mint flavor. Don't you? All right. Anyway, let's get to another email here and then I'll,
9771320	9775640	I'll see if there's anything else low. He wants to talk about this email is coming from Y Y R
9775640	9781160	over at participate at orange lawns, radio.com saying hello, LR on last week's episode,
9781160	9785320	there was a discussion about whether streamers should have to pay royalties to game developers
9785320	9790920	or publishers as a small indie developer myself. And I'm going to add this part,
9790920	9795640	download super multitasking. Thank you. Uh, continuing the email, I found the discussion
9795640	9800360	interesting and I felt compelled to weigh in as an example, it was argued that since music
9800360	9804360	royalty should be paid. If music is played, why shouldn't developer be paid when their game is
9804360	9808440	played. And once again, we have a situation where games are different from other forms of media.
9808440	9812920	Music is obtained and paid for very differently from games. Most of us either replay music that
9812920	9817720	we already own, listen to music included in the background of games we play, or hear music using
9817720	9823560	a streaming service. Back in my day, you used to tape them off the radio and then play the cassette
9823560	9828600	tape. Am I right? Loki. That's how we used to do it. All right. Um, where the beginning and the
9828600	9832760	end are kind of missing. All right. Uh, anyway, uh, let's see what are the streaming service? Yes.
9832760	9837560	Uh, if it's the latter, the streaming service pays a tiny royalty to an artist and or a publisher,
9837560	9840920	but it's one of the other two options. No money changes hands at all.
9841720	9846440	If a streamer decides to play one of my games on stream, they've already paid me. None of my
9846440	9850280	currently released games are free to play. So in essence, they've already paid me a royalty of
9850280	9855560	sorts further. I could consider it free advertising. When a streamer plays one of my games, I naturally
9855560	9860200	want as much exposure as possible. So this definitely is a benefit to me. Now you could
9860200	9864440	make a counter argument. What if I sell a million copies and I no longer need that exposure. The
9864440	9868760	counterpoint to that is simple. This is the gaming industry. One successful game does not guarantee
9868760	9872760	another. When my next release comes out, I will absolutely need to get it in front of as many
9872760	9877400	eyeballs as possible. So naturally I'll want the streamers to help me out. Once again, it's a
9877400	9882840	mutually beneficial relationship on both sides. Streamers get content developers get exposure.
9882840	9887000	I see zero issues with it. If I'm offered a royalty in the future, maybe I'd take a small
9887000	9892680	one, say 2%, like the milk. I just wouldn't want to disturb that mutually beneficial relationship.
9892680	9898360	So that's my two cents. And you know what? I appreciate hearing a developer perspective on
9898360	9904280	that. I'm still of the feeling that it should maybe be a little bit of a choice. And again,
9904280	9909160	it's not like a hard line for me. Like I'm not saying like, oh, they need to be collecting their
9909160	9915000	money and all this stuff. I'm more of the mindset where I'm kind of surprised companies like
9915000	9920440	Nintendo haven't taken more of a stance on it and tried to be more assertive because Nintendo
9920440	9926680	doesn't really need the exposure in that regard. I'm just kind of surprised we haven't really had
9926680	9932280	that conversation. And we kind of have had to an extent on like YouTube, but Nintendo has really
9932280	9938760	yet to like really assert it on Twitch. So maybe they do ultimately feel like, hey, the exposure,
9938760	9945800	the talk, it's all ads for our game. It's a good thing in the long run. But I just kind of feel
9945800	9956360	like if that shoe were to ever to drop, I'm not sure the streamers out there are as in the clear
9957000	9962840	under repurposing the content with so much percentage of your own content and those
9962840	9968760	sort of laws that they kind of claim as they might think. But I think at the end of the day,
9968760	9973960	and I think common ground that I do have with everybody in this scenario is that we need to
9973960	9978520	take another look at this law because the trademark, the patent, the copyright and all
9978520	9983320	this law we're working with is from a very different era when these sorts of technologies
9983320	9987480	didn't exist. And we need to kind of examine this law as a whole. So we don't have a fucking gray
9987480	9991320	area so that we're not asking these types of questions as to like, what is a person entitled
9991320	9995320	to and dah, dah, dah, dah, and all this stuff. So that's where my head is at with it, honestly,
9995320	10000200	at the end of the day. So yeah, and Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, fair use in video games
10000200	10005000	has never gone in front of a judge. So we don't know if it's legal or not yet. And that's what
10005000	10011560	I'm saying is that look, I love streaming too, but I'm of this reality where it's like, you know
10011560	10018520	what? The shoe might drop someday, but, and I'll end with this and I'll move on with the rest of
10018520	10023720	YYIR's email. If that shoe were to drop and I couldn't stream Nintendo games anymore, I keep
10023720	10028040	making them the bad guy and I'm only doing it because of that history with YouTube and everything
10028040	10033800	they tried to pull there. It makes it easy to point at them as the bad guy first. But if YYIR
10033800	10039720	were to come out and say, look, I know the law allows me to collect, but as an indie developer,
10039720	10044200	I'm not going to because of all these reasons I just stated in the OLR email, then guess what
10044200	10050680	YYIR, I'm playing your game. And I bet a lot of streamers would feel the same way. So, and I think
10050680	10054840	at the end of the day, and that is kind of where I landed last week is that you can make it an
10054840	10059720	option, but at the end of the day, streamers, if there's companies out there that say we realize
10059720	10064680	we could collect if we wanted to, we're not going to, to encourage you to play our game,
10064680	10068680	then streamers are going to follow suit. And I really think at the end of the day,
10068680	10072520	that's what's going to happen. Okay. So I think, I hope you hear the common ground that I really
10072520	10077000	think we kind of both have, but I'd love to hear your perspective as somebody who develops and
10077000	10082120	quite frankly has had their games streamed by me and other people out there, as you were talking
10082120	10086360	about in a previous email, which is always cool to see. All right. Onto another topic from YYIR.
10087320	10093800	I'll end by saying that I'm deeply disturbed and highly offended by a comment Rob made last week.
10094760	10102280	Well, he dared to say that White Castle burgers were gross. Rob, you take that back. You take
10102280	10107320	that back right now, or I will be all over you like mayonnaise on French fries or not.
10108520	10118360	My official response is I said what I said. That is my response. White Castle burgers are gross.
10118360	10122840	You know why they're gross? And I think it's why I don't really like McDonald's burgers that much
10122840	10130760	either. It's that steam cooking that they do at White Castle. It's gross. Now look,
10132200	10137640	I wasn't high when I ate them in Vegas and maybe if I had been, I would have enjoyed it more.
10137640	10142840	Not that I'm saying you are, but I'm just saying. I am disappointed that their closest restaurant
10142840	10148520	is in Vegas, but yeah, go on. Yeah. And that's where I had them for the first time was in Vegas.
10148600	10154520	So, there is that. S2100 Matt says, I mean, Rob wasn't wrong. Thank you, Matt. Appreciate
10154520	10161560	you being in my quarter. W04 says do not back down, Rob. I won't. This is my hill and I'm dying
10161560	10167160	on it. White Castle is overrated, but W04 does follow up saying in and out over everything.
10167160	10170760	Maybe it's because I live in California, but like in and out. In and out is good.
10170760	10178440	I don't dislike in and out by any means, but I feel like I only eat it when people are visiting
10179000	10182520	want to have in and out because they can never have it. And that's enough for me.
10182520	10188840	Like it's very rare that I'm like craving in and out. You know what I mean? I'm usually more,
10188840	10193720	I'm more now into places like Smashburger and like those types of places that kind of
10193720	10198840	Chipotle-ed the burger by doing and Shake Shack. We actually have a Shake Shack here in SAC now.
10198840	10204760	That came up on a previous episode and I like going there. I like the slightly more upscale.
10205400	10211560	Um, I do think as far as like, but see steaming the burgers, see, uh, DJ Rama S says, bro,
10211560	10215880	steam burgers are the best. Hard disagree. I'm sorry. Like if I, if I have to eat a fast food
10215880	10220840	burger and I know now I know I'm going to get screamed at if I'm talking like fast food,
10221560	10227240	honestly, like the way Burger King does it with the flame grill is way better than like
10227240	10233080	McDonald's or White Castle. That is, that is the way to do it. So that's my opinion. All right.
10235480	10241160	Uh, let's see. So lastly from YYR, uh, thanks again for the show. Election day seemed to be
10241160	10246600	miles away and here it is just two days out. We've made it this far. Hope you all continue
10246600	10253720	to hang in there. I'm trying. Hugs, Aaron, YYR. Thank you. It's uh, it's, it's been a crazy year
10253720	10260760	and like, honestly, I'm sitting here going, what can I do on Tuesday night that will not like,
10260760	10266360	and like the easy answer is play video games, but like where I am not even tempted to flip the
10266360	10271800	channel and obsess over the map as the vote tallies are coming in. And, you know, my,
10271800	10276760	my own feelings on all of this, like, what can I just like, I seriously just want to get in the car
10276760	10281000	and drive to the forest and go camping or look at stars or something that night, just
10281000	10286760	so I am nowhere near your, you're going to go to the Fort. Yes. I'm going to go to the Fort.
10286760	10295400	All right. Uh, any other last minute stories for us? Thank you for the email YYR.
10296680	10301640	Um, no, I don't really have anything else. All right. Then I think we're going to wrap up the
10301640	10306040	show. So, uh, that's it. Thank you guys so much for listening to Orange Launch Radio. I appreciate
10306040	10311960	you participating along with the show. Uh, thank you so much. Uh, we are the show where every gamer
10311960	10315000	has a voice. So if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, tell a friend,
10315000	10321000	uh, help us spread the word, um, tell a friend or two about the show, a nice tweet, an auto host on
10321000	10326520	Twitch goes a long way. I still can't see the host cause I'm logged in with the wrong account, but,
10326520	10330680	uh, I'll have to talk to Bobby if maybe I should switch over to the main account when I do this so
10330680	10336920	I can see the host. Um, but yeah, thank you guys so much for that. Um, uh, for, for the hosts and
10336920	10340280	all that stuff and those that go the extra mile with the follows and the bits and subs and all
10340280	10344360	that really appreciate you. And I'll, I'll shout those out after the show here, uh, live on Twitch.
10344360	10349960	Um, and thanks. Thanks for, um, uh, giving us something to look forward to in these pandemic-y
10349960	10354920	times where it's like, ah, I'm stuck at home all the time, nothing to do, but the show gives me
10354920	10359880	something to look forward to. So I really appreciate that. All right. Um, final thoughts
10359880	10366360	time. Loki, how about you? Your final thought? Just going to keep working on my game. Sounds
10366360	10373160	like a way to do it. Make making progress. All right. And my final thought is, um, whatever
10373160	10379720	happens on Tuesday, it's going to be fine. No matter which side of the fence you're on politically,
10379720	10387080	it's gonna, it might feel very bad. Um, but you know, and I've said this on a previous episode
10387080	10391560	about you all know my love of drag queens and things like that. And I, I kind of ending with
10391560	10397480	my final thought as something like Katya said on an episode of All Stars 2 that has not left my
10397480	10403000	mind since then, uh, is when she says, she looks in the mirror and she says, I'm not going to panic
10403560	10410280	because I don't do that anymore. So that is my mindset going into whatever may come this week.
10410280	10416520	And, um, and 2020 in general, because even if the election does go the way I want it to,
10416520	10419320	and I'm talking up and down the ballot with propositions and everything else that I'm,
10419320	10427960	I'm looking at, not just the, not just the big one. Um, I, I just, yeah, I'm not gonna panic
10427960	10432520	about a lot of stuff that I don't, I can't control. So that's, that's it. Yeah. And pod
10432520	10437800	culture and chat says, it's going to be ugly no matter how things go. And I think that is true.
10437800	10443160	Act F says, if we have endured 2020 so far, we can make this work. And I hope so. And I hope the one
10443160	10451000	positive thing about this extremely negative year is that humanity can evolve as a result of it.
10451000	10454600	If that makes sense, we're going to become smarter together and stronger together,
10455800	10462440	hopefully. And I'll leave you on that thought. So, um, enjoy playing your games, enjoy, uh,
10462440	10469240	the next, um, you know, seven days of gaming, enjoy, uh, this week, you know, uh, and enjoy
10469240	10474440	looking forward to the next consoles, PlayStation five, uh, and Xbox series X and all that good
10474440	10480840	stuff. Have a wonderful week. You guys we'll see you next time. Good night. You've been listening
