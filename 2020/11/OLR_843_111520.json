{"text": " I've always envied the difference of music culture in Japan. Since I started playing imported games, I also learned about the number of albums they release. Everything from official OSTs, remix or remake OSTs like the Final Fantasy piano and vocal collections to doujin released by the producers themselves. But here in the States and on the internet at large the story is very different and I don't wish the legal hassle on anyone. Join your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki as they explain this and the rest of the week's news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice. Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio Live. Once again tonight episode number 843 of our show for this November the 15th of 2020. My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined here as I am live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network with my co-hosts say hello first and foremost to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Hello. Hi Jamie, how are you doing? Oh I'm on week four but I'm finally starting to feel better. I'll put it this way my tests are negative but my doctor hasn't ruled out COVID. Oh interesting. I've heard of false negatives and things like that so. Well the thing is is that I also did the serology test and the serology test is pretty much useless because a good portion of the population doesn't create antibodies. Well hang in there I'm glad to hear you're at least on the mend and doing better. Yeah I basically have one more week of recovery and then I'm clear so. Sounds good. It's just my voice has been cutting out so but I can talk a little bit longer just it still is kind of like sounding like you know that fry. I'm really looking forward to the day when all of us can be in the same studio again I know it's still several months out but just really looking forward to that day so. Just wait until we have a competent administration. I know 65 days anyway before I introduce everybody else it's no secret obviously this week new game console release week it's a big week and dark soccer we've talked before on the show about how you guys are kind of waiting for a little bit so I thought since you are the queen of classic games I thought I'd put you on the spot with a different question here and I'm going to open this up to our chat as well because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network twitch.tv slash a vog network Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwell show so the question is we're going to be talking about some launch games that came out and you know some other things too but looking back on all of the systems throughout history and all of the various launch titles we've had like you know. Games that have launched consoles there's been some good ones there's been some terrible ones I'm kind of curious dark soccer if you have a particular favorite or maybe memorable launch title in your heart. I am putting her on the spot I didn't warn her about this question so she might need a little time to think but I'm putting you all on the spot in our chat room as well if you guys have any questions or any any questions of course you have questions. There were definitely ones that I like but I think the one that really just stuck itself out as memorable for me actually I've got two that I can name because I just remember how how cool it felt you know was a I'm pretty sure Super Mario World was a launch title it was yeah I mean I remembered Super Mario Brothers wasn't initially so I kind of was getting into a little bit mixed but yeah Super Mario World was like one of the big ones for me we had gotten my mom's like that year should we get your brother a Super Nintendo or Genesis and I'm like you're getting them Super Nintendo and it's for me so I told her what games to get I was like I don't care what else you get but you have to get you know a link to the past you know but Super Mario World was for me just the big thing that made me super super excited about having a Super Nintendo I played the shit out of it my brother sucked at it but you know they were like 10 something like that and I probably played it so much more than they did I've beaten it completely by myself when the game first came out and when I dedicated a lot of time to link to the past after that but that really stuck out for me and then another one was Sonic Adventure because remember we had our our Dreamcast pretty much right after the Japanese launch and we played so much Sonic Adventure and you know looked for all the glitchy stuff and everything I really really enjoyed Sonic Adventure I was really into it of course it had some of my favorite Japanese voice actors in it like for Knuckles at this time okay I have to also explain I had a minor obsession with with Hayashi Nobutoshi who was also he was Tatsuki in Fushigi Yugi he was Basara in Macross 7 got a really amazing singing voice and you know so and he was you know he he was in the game and I he was Knuckles he was Knuckles voice actor and so I was really really just enamored with the game I liked playing Amy even though she was a little bit annoying I liked the music in it I was so enamored so when the US Dreamcast launch happened so I actually have to rewind a little bit more for that because there was the rental before launch and we did rent a US one yeah yeah and that demo version that was the US one and then after that when we got our our US Dreamcast we just played through Sonic Adventure again of course I had to switch the voices back to Japanese because after playing it so long in Japanese the US voices were disjointed to me it was just not saying the voice actor was bad I'm just saying that I was still used I mean I have the same problem with anime today like if I go watch any Dragon Ball I have to watch it in Japanese because those are the voices I heard first right um I still prefer Ranma in Japanese because I watched it that way first Sailor Moon same thing you know um so uh the one of the few anime that I'm not like that with is those who hunt elves because I first watched it in English and I got used to those voice actors so it's kind of um but but going back to it um you know I I those two were probably the big ones that stick out in my head as far as um some of the more memorable ones all right um great yeah I really loved it great answers um let me add some stuff in chat and then I've got to introduce uh the other folks on tonight's show who've been waiting patiently uh so uh let me see uh act def says breath of the wild is definitely one of the best launch titles ever yeah nintendo certainly knows how to launch a console huh I like this answer from bobby blackwolf my favorite xbox 360 launch title was geometry wars and she hulk 10 says dead rising 3 for xbox one was and is awesome I forgot that was a launch title and yeah the dead rising series that was a good one all right uh waiting patiently and with us every week say hello of course to tech master loki joining us tonight hello hey loki how are you doing I'm doing okay what are you running behind you tonight is that is that final fight like a sequel not the first one what is that no it's cadillacs and dinosaurs I have an idea for like I've seen that for um a game I was supposed to put behind me and like I had it like earlier this week I was like oh yeah I saw a game like yeah I need to do that one and completely forgot it today oh no like mo wiki was it that I saw like it was something that I saw out there I was like oh yeah I totally remember that I need to put that behind me but nope completely forgot so my memory has always been terrible it's been getting worse as I get older and now it's getting even worse because this whole quarantine situation and they actually say that like you know it's it's contributing to people having the brain fog and all that stuff so it's uh welcome to old age loki yeah I don't know if it's that it's just there's you know different things going on this week so I I'm sure whatever it was that I saw you know I thought it might have been like um sam and max I can't remember if I've done that already because of all the like sam max news we'll be talking about but um I don't know if it was that it was something else but like I saw it and I was like oh yeah I need to do that and then immediately like today I was like okay wait what game was that I was thinking of so I have it really quickly come up with something all right well we'll come back to you in a minute because I want to talk about how launch week has been going for the new consoles uh I want to know did you well okay I'm gonna even guess did you even get your xbox you were worried about that with walmart no it came right when they said it was going to so yeah I actually earlier than they said it was going to so they originally said it was going to be here on the 12th but it ended up being here on launch day so it was fine um but yeah yeah I have it sitting right here under my monitor I think I got my got my controller and everything but yeah it's sitting here I got a brand new 4k monitor um for it so it's looking nice all right well I'm gonna come back to you in a minute because we're gonna talk all about the new xbox but um he's been waiting there so patiently and you guys on twitch uh that are watching live can see that he's back tonight and I've got to introduce say hello everybody to shane or shad starzik on twitch if you will who's joining us again tonight hi shane hello and I gotta say shane you are looking so much better than the last time you were here yeah I feel better good still run down I'm actually feeling run down but that's okay I've got dr pepper and I have to study for a test tomorrow so I'm gonna be up all night yeah and for those um that missed uh the episode you were here what about like four or five weeks ago um on the show and you were right in the midst of three was it wow time flies uh you were right in the midst of battling covid last time you were on the show but you came here anyway to talk about I think it was the pokemon dlc you were talking about that night so um and you you were kind of like lying in bed still but tonight you're you're propped up you've got you know that light effect I know I'm in my I'm in my computer chair my little corner in the living room and I'm using my brand new iphone 12 pro math oh rub it in why don't you shaky I don't have a web so this is just what has to work no honestly the phone works I'm using the phone for this particular shot here that's going out on twitch right now so it works all right um but uh part of the reason I brought you here tonight was because uh if you've been listening to orange launch radio then you know that I want to get an or I've gotten an xbox pre-ordered one of those uh we'll talk about how that went because it wasn't so smooth loki got an xbox none of us really have playstation 5 represented here uh so shane you got a playstation 5 this week right and so so you've got both so I want to talk to you about how this week went so obviously um this is a big week uh last week our show got cut short abruptly unfortunately thanks to the internet which I'm hoping is holding in there more steady tonight knock on wood but I've had less problems this week which is good um but um last week we were still able to talk for an hour and a half we talked a good chunk about how we are on the dawn of a new generation with playstation and xbox launching new consoles you know and we were kind of wondering you know is it too early for them to be doing it is it going to be worth it and all this and now we have a lot of answers to many of those questions um echoing something that bobby said uh he goes on of course before us here at the voice geeks network echoing something that he said uh is that well clearly the launch went great because they're selling out so no these consoles didn't go or I'm sorry no these consoles didn't come out too early because they're selling out so it's going very well and yeah the consoles have been very hard to obtain um loki I'll start with you uh on the xbox series x so tell us how that went for you the ordering process and kind of what you've been playing on it I figured we usually do a kickoff topic here on tonight's show and then we do our gaming weeks but this week the big topic is our gaming weeks so we're just going to kind of jump into it so loki I'm going to kind of ask you about your gaming week with the xbox series x sure so like the ordering process it was basically when those orders were opened up originally back in september I just had all the different you know retailers online uh all their sites open and walmart happened to be the first one that let me put something in my cart and submit the order so that's what I went with and so I was always I was kind of worried that it may not arrive on time or at all because I had issues with my mario kart live where came to be launch day and they hadn't even shipped yet so I had to cancel that one but thankfully I was able to get that in store um I knew that wouldn't be the case with the xbox series x so um other than that I mean it was fine it arrived on time like I said you know I was worried that it would be here late um because originally they were estimating the 12th but it arrived on the 10th and I was like cool and uh uh so really what I've been playing on I don't really have a ton of stuff so I haven't had an xbox since the 360 so I finally got games pass ultimate and I just was downloading some stuff on there actually I was looking at all my xbox stuff I have on there like 94 games because of my old 360 games of gold stuff um so there's quite a bit old 360 games I have but I don't really have a lot of um xbox one games I guess I have a few with like crackdown and uh forza because I purchased those on pc uh which is nice but um so I ended up getting yakuza like a dragon because I wasn't really sure of what launch games I really wanted there was nothing really kind of standing out and I was trying to look at look for something that was really showing off the series x and really the only thing they have is like forza horizon 4 and I already have that so I started downloading that it's taken a long time but I think it's finally downloaded now I've been mainly playing yakuza um which is interesting because I've never played a yakuza game before and this one is more like a um an rpg so they've they actually set up because the main character is a huge fan of dragon quest and so it's all turn-based combat which I I love it it's great cool um the story is a bit slow but it's just like it really feels like playing like a dragon quest or final fantasy game it's just kind of funny in that sense I I heard that I heard that that was um like that that it was more like an old school rpg so it's kind of more of a spin-off game so you know and I've had people for years telling me you need to get into yakuza you need to get into that series I wonder if the fans of the series would think this is a good one to start with or no don't start here definitely different because the other ones are brawlers I mean this is still a brawler but it's turn-based so it's different um it's all right I mean it's certainly not like a huge powerhouse like pretty looking game I mean it does look um not like it's pushing the high-end graphics or anything like that but I don't know it's all right I I've enjoyed it a little bit I haven't been playing a whole ton because I've been working on my game but I did play like a probably like five hours of it so far and it's all right it's just there's so much story and we're like I'm still like in the tutorial section of the game haven't even gotten very far and it's just it's so much dialogue like I get it but there's like some of it doesn't really it's just like dragging out so long like oh my god and they have options to skip past dialogue but I'm like worried I'm missing something but I'm really not missing anything um so I don't know it's just it's really slow to get started but it is somewhat interesting the story is interesting enough it's just it's like oh my god when are we going to get to like the actual like game um but the action's cool so there are some action sequences and stuff in the game um I don't know I I enjoy it so far we'll we'll see how long I play through it and everything um aside from that I did try Minecraft a little bit because my kid wanted me to play it and honestly I can't say that it looks any different that's definitely not a game that would uh benefit from the series x now saying that once they do push out the ray tracing stuff which I have played on pc uh that does look really great like if they can do that on a series x then that would be definitely one to revisit because it looks really good when they do that um but right now obviously it doesn't look any different than it did before um I saw it in the list I haven't downloaded it yet but lost odysseys on games pass since I was like we should go back to lost odyssey um but no I've been really kind of just going through there to see you know what really um showcase the system I know Ori um might be a good one um fours horizon like I said I've already downloaded that but like I'm worried I don't want to fill up the hard drive already with this all the games out and stuff and I mean hopefully still uh we have uh cyberpunk coming out in you know a little less than a month yeah we definitely definitely don't want another delay on that for sure yeah so hopefully that comes out but yeah I'm gonna jump in here because I I forgot we have a time constraint with shane so I want to make sure he's able to um get his impressions especially with the playstation 5 and so forth so I'll come back to you though loki if you have more to add um but shane how was your week with the new consoles how did that go for you um so pretty easy for me in terms of getting them we've talked about like the magical powers I have for things like persuasion for people to get stuff done and I'm also an expert at getting in line for things which is kind of how I got at least one of these consoles um so xbox whatever you guys are going to talk about that I haven't really done much with it to be completely honest um real quick why why is the xbox taking a back seat for you because it wasn't the console I was originally getting I only got it under a weird circumstance so um okay ps5 I went to best buy because I had gotten a pre-order there and I went at six in the morning because that was my time slots because they were doing time slots to pick up uh your system and literally there were probably about 20 people 20 25 people that were there for the same time slot like they were all people that had it pre-ordered it was a pretty smooth process except I saw if you haven't seen the box I can't really reach it right so whatever it has a little handle on top so you can carry it it's one of those like cheap little plastic handles isn't it it's really flimsy and I saw three people hold it by the handle and the handle snapped while they were holding it and the console come crashing down to the floor as they were walking out of the store yike so yeah that wasn't good um otherwise I I don't want to say I'm a Sony fanboy but I tend to just play on their products mostly besides Nintendo and uh I love my ps5 the controller is fantastic it's just basically the same as what the joy cons were trying to do but a little more advanced feeling um for launch games I've I got four I got Demon's Souls which I haven't played yet I just installed it I got the Miles Morales game that came with Spider-Man 1 and so I played a little bit of Spider-Man but not Miles Morales yet uh I got the Sackboy game haven't even opened it yet or installed it and I got Godfall I did install that and I played that for probably a good hour and a half pretty fun little like hack and slash loot game um and it's really pretty and that's what I guess I didn't realize I was missing on my um on my consoles was like a really nice high definition 60 frames per second experience and that's what I'm getting with these new games I don't I don't switch it to oh no I don't switch Godfall into the pretty fancy ray tracing mode because it just chugs if you do that but if you keep it on performance it's beautiful and really fast Spider-Man though super cool looking at 60 frames a second but I keep it on the visual fidelity mode because it's really really nice looking I can deal with 30 frames a second problem and Astrobot to me Astrobot is so good I don't care if it's just like Playstation propaganda throughout the entire game it's such a nostalgic trip for some of the things I've seen I love it I've heard a lot of good things about Astro Boy considering you know I think most people are kind of I'm sorry Astrobot Astro Boy is a different thing considering so many people were um like overlooking it as just just kind of writing it off as oh the tech demo game that you know they're just kind of throwing in there because it's cheap but it really seems like a lot of social media is really taking to this game like no it is it's a strong game on its own just for like you're saying the nostalgia features and being able to kind of show everything off like it's it seems like it's a much better kind of deal than one two switch same oh yeah for sure and it really gets you acquainted with the controller and all the things that are uh available to to uh be used for that fancy new controller um we'll see if in even six months time if other games are taking advantage of it Godfall didn't really feel that special um in terms of like fun controller things neither did uh regular Spider-Man so uh we'll see maybe maybe more people will look to Astrobot now that it's out more developers will and really see what they can do with that um just tell me if you have to go by the way but um I I want to ask you this question kind of about the since I don't you know you're kind of like our PlayStation 5 voice tonight what do you kind of think like do you feel like this console is like a huge step up from the four like what is this like really bringing to the table for you that's exciting so the load time and that's something I can like even speak to on the Series X the load times make all the difference in the world it feels like for example besides Astrobot probably the game I played most on the PS5 is Fuser um from Harmonix I wondered when you were gonna bring that up yeah because these are so good um so I just downloaded it all I was playing a little bit on PS4 when it launched then I was like screw it I'm not even going to keep my PS4 out here anymore so let's just move everything to PS5 and just I can't believe how I was sitting through load times before this these systems it's just I never want load times again but the trade-off is at least for now I'm already onto like maybe 400 under 400 gigs left on my PS5 for storage space and that sucks that like Spider-Man both of them together were already 100 gigs that's like almost under just under a seventh of the entire hard drive that you get or no just under about a six yeah it sucks like I don't know what they need to do I don't know what the industry needs to do to make these things cheaper but that's I guess I guess beautiful graphics fast loading ridiculous face constraints that's what the new generation feels like um at least we know the space stuff is upgradeable later on um if but it's kind of expensive those I mean at least the official like solid state drives are kind of expensive I mean a regular USB drive not so much but then you're missing that perk of the loading time which yeah over on Series X which I'll talk about in a minute I'm definitely noticing like wow this really changes things with the loading time it's pretty impressive I don't even have time to switch to like the right input on my Series X before it's already up like I'll hit the button on the controller to turn on the system and I hear the noise and then I reach for the remote and turn it to the right input and it's already there it's instant it's pretty amazing um tell us quickly before I let you go about about Fusor like what is it about that game you love so much I love drop mix and Fusor is just drop mix without physical cards and you get to make a character and you get a weird camp mode and it has like rhythm based mechanic like timing and it's so much fun I just just hope it's not like I hope it gets supported for longer than six months because that feels like the average harmonics game or even that might be stretching it um but I already want more dlc I went all in on it got the big fancy pack uh I pre-ordered so I got three more songs and literally uh you make like your own sort of deck thing your own box of different like music cards and every single box I make like there's three songs I keep in there I don't care if it has to be like if they're focusing on like uh rock music or if they're focusing this box on uh rap and r&b and stuff like that or country like I always keep freaking ghosts and stuff by deadmau5 and rob swire eyes by rufus soul and the other one keep in there oh where's your head at my basement those three are always in every box I make because I refuse to let them go because I I always throw the vocals on over uh with one of those songs I can't stop um are they gonna uh I thought I was reading this might be a thing but let's say you wanted to so obviously shared play is the thing in the sony universe if you wanted to share play your playstation 5 but I'm only on playstation 4 am I going to be able to see that or does that not work interesting we'll have to try it because I haven't tried any like I haven't really done a lot okay so here's how it is oh I got two new fancy consoles what do I do last night I play pokemon it's just you know like I'm sitting 15 feet away from them looking at them and I'm like oh but I should probably go shiny in pokemon that's a good idea I get it though because like you know I have shiny new consoles and we're still signing on to play final fantasy 14 and do dungeons so you know I will not put that on my ps there is no space for that game yeah I'm good with keeping that on my computer all right uh shane I know I I gotta let you go because you have another uh thing you gotta do but um thanks sorry I know you had to sit there for a long time but uh we have a lot to say sorry about it um but I'm sure we'll have you back again soon okay okay take care buddy bye all right um so while I fix the camera settings here live on twitch um loki anything else you want to see on the xbox because I had to cut you off a little bit sorry no it's fine so it's funny enough like I was looking at uh some of the playstation 5 games that have come out like especially like the footage of um spider-man miles morales and even like uh sack boy and um astro bots and stuff kind of makes me want to playstation 5 but I'm certainly waiting until next year when um I don't think they're gonna go down in price but when there's um more availability and maybe when playstation vr2 gets announced or is coming out um so we'll see when that happens but um definitely in the short run like I think there's more um interesting games on the launch end for playstation 5 but the reason I picked an xbox series x is because I feel especially with all these company acquisitions and bethesda and everything that there's gonna be a lot more games exclusive games coming to the xbox side of things um it's definitely a game pass machine and that's not a bad thing yeah yeah and what's cool though like too like with yakuza like say for example if I don't want to have that on my uh like I feel that this game's kind of a grind fest I was like man if I could really run this with like trainers and stuff on pc it'd be great and I can because it's all cross by so I have it on pc too when I make a purchase on xbox um series x or on the xbox marketplace so like I could essentially download it to my pc if I have not enough space on my series x interesting um yeah because they've been doing the cross by thing for a little bit because like I remember forza horizon on xbox one and there's been several titles on xbox one a lot of especially like the real first party microsoft stuff was cross by and that's why there's a lot of people that are like why do I need to get an xbox if I have a pc I don't need to get which is fine sorry I shouldn't do a voice with that but for some people it's what I hear because I feel like they're trying to take a dig at xbox but I realize some people have that very measured approach to where it's like I've got a top of the line pc there's not really anything micro the xbox going to do for me and I do kind of get that but like if you sign up for game pass microsoft still got your money yeah I don't think they care whether you get a system or not I think it's long as you're playing their games they don't really care and and that's the thing it's like if you don't want to get you know an xbox series x right now maybe there's not something that you want to play on it you can always get games pass or whatever and play their games and they come out you don't have to pay any additional money for it so it's not too bad I honestly so this is going to be a really weird statement but I'm gonna this is my early thought like and I I think the series x is great I'm gonna get my impressions in a minute but I almost feel like what game pass is bringing to the table and eventually what sony is going to have to respond with their with their own you know playstation plus library sorry I always get the name wrong of that but you know they're they're equivalent essentially I almost feel like the next generation in some ways is more about that and the transition to that kind of ecosystem than necessarily about more bigger graphics and ray tracing and okay the loading times yeah I mean that is that is certainly a big difference but I almost feel like that other transition is going to be more representative of what we went through in this generation from the last generation if that makes sense so all right yeah so anyway um let me talk a little bit about my uh story with the series x so it actually is a little bit interesting because um what ended up happening is that I got the um series x on amazon I pre-ordered it there the day it went live for everybody and um I got that email on monday that a lot of people got that said oh uh you're not going to be getting that console until december 31st you know at some point until then some so I knew I wasn't going to be getting it tuesday so um I was like crap I've got to go find somewhere that I can actually like try to find one of these on shelves so shane said he heard that best buy and target were doing things so he was on best buys website I was on target's website and I was able to get one long story short at target so I went into a store and picked one up at target um and you could I had to go to the other side of town to do it but I was I was like hey I got one whatever I'm good so that process honestly was pretty easy um they didn't shrink wrap the box or anything they didn't even put it in a bag they and there's no handle on that box so the dude just kind of brought it out was like here you go and like handed me the box which I had to take take this xbox series x out to the parking lot to my car like just no way to hide it but you're mugging yeah I know right thankfully it was still light out and there's signs at target they're everywhere that are like security cameras still in use uh that whole thing but I made it home um and again a big reason why I opted for series x as opposed to playstation 5 is because I have a playstation 4 pro I don't have an xbox 1x so I figured the jump from xbox one the xbox series x was going to be a bigger jump and I really think I was right um so one of the games I've been playing a lot of on series x is no man sky yep I never shut up about that game and I've started that game probably over like seven times well guess what bitches I started my eighth playthrough thanks to a game pass and having that on series x you will notice if you have xbox the new one if you go into the game pass library it has a little icon in the corner that says enhanced for xbox series x or s has a little logo for that so you can actually see the games and uh no man's sky of course is one of them we talked about on last week's show that it was going to be getting that and um there's a bunch of others too dead by daylight forza horizon the new ori game um and so forth so there's there's plenty of games that have gotten the upgrades and did I notice the upgrades for no man's sky on series x um compared to playstation 4 pro yes I did um it number one is the loading times my god like I used to have to sit there for a minute and a half you know while it's loading into the galaxy in my plate that now it's down to seconds it's like 20 seconds 30 seconds um something like that it's it's crazy um and um I I notice the graphics um I I do notice a little bit of pop in um but I noticed that on any of the consoles or I've I've noticed pop in on pc I just think it's part of how the algorithm is in that game um but the thing that kind of strikes me is that I notice the high definition textures even on things that are in the distance and that's probably the biggest thing that I noticed playing on series x versus playing on any other system I've played on I've played that game on a lot of systems um especially I will say I played no man's sky just a little bit on xbox one when it first went to game pass it's it's garbage on the original xbox one compared to what it is now like the game the game hasn't changed but the graphics like night and day night and day it looks so much better so um I uh yeah I enjoy uh I enjoy I'm enjoying uh no man's sky again I've probably dropped easily like 10 hours on the latest playthrough I am blowing up my twitter with screenshots because that's one of my favorite things to do in that game because I just like you know I people say no man's sky is kind of like minecraft and there is it's it's definitely crafting is the backbone of the game um but minecraft to me everything looks very samezy you're either overground you're underground you're in the nether you know but there's only so many different environments that's the thing about no man's sky that really strikes me is that every time you go to this new planet it's going to look a lot different from where you were at before yes there's there's some basic types that they all kind of fit into but there's definitely enough variety and enough rare stuff that happens to kind of keep things exciting and that's that's part of why I really enjoy no man's sky um here's the other interesting thing I noticed with series x though is that because I didn't do xbox 1x there's some games that were already enhanced for xbox 1x that I kind of missed so I went to go check some of those out too so some of the other games I played this week I played skyrim the definitive edition whatever the they call the remaster one because alan is back into playing that on pc so he's playing that a lot so I was like oh I'll download this to show it to him on xbox and we were both kind of taken with wow this looks really good like you know it's like playing max settings on a pc but it's on my tv and the frame rate very good like when you're looking around and stuff that whole opening when you're in the back of the cart and everything sometimes you know the frame rate could get a little weird there if you're looking around a lot of pop in on the trees and stuff looks very fluid on the xbox series x you definitely notice it so I think that's another thing that you know it's very similar to how if you're playing playstation 4 games on playstation 5 it's like oh like god of war is like 60 frames a second now like everything's like running better a lot of that is happening with the xbox one games too I think even on things they're not advertising our xbox series s or x the other one that I played a little bit of that I was like wow this looks so good was final fantasy 15 and you know that game has its pluses and it has its minuses but I will say it looks great in 4k um but you know I I that was the first time I'd really gotten to play that in true 4k so um kind of interesting uh other games I checked out on the series x this week uh I checked out tetris effect connected I did not like that multiplayer is only restricted to ranked or play with friends so there's no casual mode that's unranked I was a little disappointed in that otherwise it's um tetris effect without the vr part which is still a great game and worth uh you taking a look at if you have a game pass or what have you um and then forza horizon 4 I looked at briefly for a little bit and of course that game looks great too and it's just one of those things where how fast that game moves that game moves so fast and it looks so good while it's doing it so I I definitely am noticing like the fluid like you get more constant 60 frames a second things look really good in the distance as well as they do close up I am noticing some of those like subtleties in this new generation but are the games themselves different yet well no because most of the launch games are all bumped back especially on the xbox side we barely got anything on the xbox side you got the yakuza you got assassin's creed and stuff but nothing that really feels distinctly next generation and I'm imagining it not until the new halo game or something really strong first party or really going to see that but that being said I'm very I'm very happy with the xbox series x it's like getting a brand new video card in the computer and a new chip and like getting that upgrade that really gives it a kick in the pants and now you want to go back and play all your old favorites to see how smooth they run again it's very that and that's that phase we're in right now while we wait for these other big launch titles so um some comments from chat I'm sorry I've been ignoring you guys um Bobby Blackwell says yeah I've been playing Final Fantasy 15 on my xbox 1x and it's beautiful um let's see uh bonds 006 says I'm playing Tetris Effect with a girlfriend on xbox she will learn the ways of Tetris well Tetris is for for everybody boys and girls and everything uh all the peoples um let's see um sj100 matt says I'm really getting a series x first to play game pass and at some point cyberpunk I will be getting uh enjoying forest horizon 4 when I eventually do get my series x which will be some time week of thanksgiving um act def says which of these will rob end up with more of no man's sky playthroughs or copies of mass effect 3 uh this would be like my eighth no man's sky playthrough but it's not my eighth copy of no man's sky uh it's just I've started a new playthrough every time they do a big patch so I think no man's sky is gonna have a beat Bobby Blackwell says I think no man's sky also got a playstation 5 upgrade yes it did uh and I would fully expect all the nice things I said about xbox excuse me all the nice things I said about no man's sky on xbox series x are probably going to apply to the playstation 5 as well and anybody jumping up from an original playstation 4 version I'm I'm fairly positive you're going to think all those same things um so there is that um I will say I've noticed a few bugs in no man's sky I tweeted one of them I died instantly on loading one of my saves that was a bummer but you know things happen um and uh sometimes when the aliens tend to hold objects or they're talking to you and the objects kind of vibrate and shake and move everywhere like they're not staying in one place um I feel like these are things that we're gonna see a patch from hello games in a week or two the only thing that broke the game was that loading bug and I feel like that may not be I feel like that may just happen in that game and it may not be exclusive to an xbox thing I feel like you can probably get that on pc honestly so there is that um okay um I think that's pretty much all I need to say on my gaming week uh Loki any anything else on the xbox that I missed no not really I can't think of anything are you happy with your purchase so far do you think are you glad you got one now um yeah I'm happy that I got it I'm gonna be really happy once cyberpunk comes out even though I already have it purchased on pc um I'll get it twice I guess um I don't know I mean I probably didn't need it right away but you know it's it's better just to get it now and then instead of trying to fight to get it later on I guess all right well let's see if anybody wants to add anything to their gaming weeks outside of these new consoles so dark soccer I'll start with you because I'm sure your gaming oh you just popped up you good to go okay uh and you just I didn't you might be muted still but um how was your oh there you go okay how was your gaming week dark soccer outside of new consoles well we picked up a thing for um Dan's birthday that's a new console oh what but I'm not talking about it yet okay I have a story about it later uh oh okay I know where this is going okay okay got it a thing that ign ranked above the xbox and the playstation 5 okay I'm curious all right we'll talk about that in a minute then yeah so I so I actually played some of it today uh again that will come up later um I played a little bit of pinball um it's been kind of hard to play anything else and playing animal crossing we just had our driveway done so it was really loud outside and I could hardly hear anything and on top of that anytime I tried to play something that like would get me excited um well my heart would start racing really badly and I would almost have an asthma attack so I'm keeping it calm just keeping it calm lots of wordscapes and lots of animal crossing and a little bit of pinball but you know it gets the heart racing a bit much is it was basically coming off of the prednisone anything that I was playing that would kind of you know kick me up into into overdrive would uh get my heart rate racing too fast because the prednisone so now that I'm off of it I can play some stuff again so yay no scary games for a little bit oh no scary games are fine because they don't really scare me it's just things that are more like actiony you know okay so um but uh I've uh I've got a few few things coming up on my plate and I'm finally once uh all of this is behind me I'm gonna do my charity stream so you get to see uh I think that um dream daddy went out on my pole so I'm gonna gonna get me a daddy let's see which daddy I go for might get myself a nice bear oh it's not the first time I've heard that all right probably not from an ace girl uh loki anything you wanted to add to your gaming week outside of the new stuff um well just you know I did like I said I did play a little bit of Minecraft I played a lot more Minecraft though on pc and I was working on our realm that um myself and my kids have so I was finishing up this giant roller coaster with like tons of redstone stuff in it um so I finished up the actual like coaster part of that still need to decorate it but it's our our giant um creeper mine type roller coaster thing it's kind of fun because we actually have like a creeper in a minecart that we have triggered to go at certain times so you see him like zoom by if I have to add some more of that stuff in there have to probably shoot some video for it at some point and then also uh my youngest son wanted me to play egg wards with him on one of the Minecraft servers out there so I tried that today as well and unfortunately it's hard to play with people that you don't know that there's no strategy or anything and no one's talking and everybody's just kind of doing their own thing or just idling there so that was fun um but yeah he was really excited about it so oh and Orna played more Orna yep that's about it yeah I don't think I have a lot to add to my gaming week outside of the consoles except you know continuing my uh my paladin in final fantasy 14 hit 80 so there's another class at 80. I will say to answer act f's earlier question I have more jobs at max level in final fantasy 14 than I do playthroughs of no man's sky if you want to know the game I really play too much of there's your answer there but I also did a live stream of that earlier this week because I was like I haven't done a stream in a long time um my some aspects of my mental health are actually improving um I can't imagine why um but I was in a place where I felt like I could I could do a stream earlier this week so I did um and uh yeah it felt pretty good I'll have to do more I I've been directly asked on twitter by multiple people if I will do no man's sky on the xbox series x as a stream yes I just don't know what night yet so um stay tuned for that on my personal channel at rob roberts um and then uh you know kind of the gps stuff um I'm a little irritated with the niantic gps stuff but I'm gonna save that for another week I want to I want to marinate on that and see how I feel in seven days um but I have been playing orna still so that's um that's pretty good so yeah um I'm looking for other suggestions of gps games that I haven't like I I thought I was on top of all of them but I think there's some that I've missed out on so um I I was writing a tweet about that so I'm kind of curious if I might discover anything new this week we'll see so uh yeah act deaf to chat says that's true final fantasy 14 is the game you're always playing yes that is very true but it's kind of the social element of that game for sure but a lot of people like for some people call of duty is that game because they get online with their friends and play that game for some people um destiny is that game because they get online or destiny 2 whatever get online and play you know what I mean a lot of people have that kind of game that their friends get together and play for some people um it's dungeons and dragons you know before the pandemic people were getting together and playing dnd during the pandemic they're doing it on zoom you know and other alternative board game types of things so there's always game night for something to run a game what's that I'm just looking for someone to run a game for me to be in oh you should you should run second edition for me you should uh get a podcast type thing together dm I'm a shitty dm no no but you don't have to dm it you can be the one that records it and publishes it if you want but I need someone to run it and I need someone to run second edition dnd for me all right well y'all y'all heard her y'all heard dark soccer's request get in touch with her on twitter you're a twitter person now you you weren't using the site very much at all for a long time and now just in the past few months your twitter's been on fire I'm pretty exclusive on it now I mean I need like this is a stupid ego thing but I really wish that I had like the eight more followers to hit a thousand because I did ignore it for a while you know yeah and now I've got two of them don't forget I have gen x geeks because of course my blog and which my blog is actually I feel like it's starting to to do better I found my flow on it oh good so um but but I mean yeah okay so you have two twitter accounts on your phone do you know how do you know how many I have I have this I'm just showing it from a distance I have one so I have my okay one two three four five six seven eight nine I have nine accounts on my phone nine twitter accounts because yeah and no there's no after dark alt we're gonna rule that out right now that is not one of them okay but I have me olr horde house I haven't used this in 2014 uh my very secret day job twitter account that nobody knows about nobody's going to know about that is not an invitation to go find it um because that is that is me separating day and night stuff vog network guys on a show reading his fundamental podcast pokey stop podcast and shaking and crying I have nine twitter accounts now granted I only use maybe three of those with any regularity anymore but it's just funny so soon soon you'll have more of them because I mean I made one for the sisters a long ass time ago I had like another personal one that was going to be super private that I never used and I had lady 99 for a while when I was doing my sort of uh protest stuff and I just said fuck it I'll just be public about my protesting gotcha so I mean I've got I've got maybe about that many just that I've had for different purposes and different organizations that I'm in but right now I'm focusing on those two because um I want to have something dedicated for my blog um and then um something that's just like my thing that I can complain at everybody about and uh get overwhelmed with people posting about chipping on supernatural I've noticed a lot of supernatural chat on your twitter this week but I get it because the show I know is winding down and hey you know what Stacey Abrams is talking about supernatural on her twitter so you're in good company oh yeah no that's cool she's been getting some love from the cast uh as well um and I've actually been I've had a couple of just little quick chats with with some of the some of the folks who do some good things I've actually really started getting involved I know this is completely different started getting involved with random acts.org um that uh some of the people who have been or associated with the cast um organized for doing basically good charity work but also just encouraging everyone to be a little kinder so be kind and run me a dnd game well I I have lots of kind things I could say about Stacey Abrams I'm not even going to make it a political thing I mean yes I I love her politics but just even outside of that and even if you are you know in a different political mind spot I will say I love the fact that she is like an out nerd in politics and she's very you know she talks about supernatural did you see that video where she was ranking all the star tracks and she wasn't sitting there going well I always like she like she had her facts she's like I like this one because of this story and what it does is I was like okay okay not not that anyone should ever have to prove I wasn't top on there though I don't want to hear it ds9 was not top sorry uh what did she put on top maybe she did no no she put voyager on top because I was like yes yes me too I was like I that's another reason I love her she put voyager on top voyager wasn't didn't deserve the bad rap that it got yeah I I still say deep space nine is the best of them all yeah but no I mean she she not and I was gonna say not that anyone should ever have to prove her fandom but there is something extra special about the fact that she had like she had deep answers anyway I'm sorry this isn't the Stacey Abrams fan club podcast I mean it could be but it's uh it's OLR let's talk about other video games uh anything else for our gaming weeks I think we got it all out let's then move on to some news there's been a lot that's been going on in the news um about new consoles and other stuff as well right Loki uh yes so of course more information coming out about the consoles and what they support and don't support so one bit of um information that we have is right now the playstation 5 doesn't support 1440p resolutions so if you have a monitor that's 1440p well you're just gonna have to play it at 1080p instead um which is unfortunate because I know a lot of people that are getting high refresh rate monitors may only be able to get 1440p like the one I got right now I was hoping to get an hdmi 2.1 because that's what all these new consoles are um but there aren't any monitors or hdmi 2.1 right now so that's basically what you need to be able to do 120 frames per second and 4k at the same time so now I can only do 4k and 60 fps or I could do 1440p at 120 so that's kind of what I'm sticking with at least on the Xbox side but the Xbox series x does support 1440p so that's always good um now whether that may be coming to the playstation 5 later possibly because right now according to the VP of platform management uh Hideki Nishino basically said that they wanted to prioritize tv support that's why that 1440p isn't currently supported because that's mainly a monitor format and not a tv um but later on there's um no reason no technical reasons to be able to support that later on so that may be something that's coming if demand um requires it to um along with that there are some issues with some of the games that are backwards compatible that may have um problems playing now we talked about last week how there are some of the assassins creed games that were not being supported 100 and actually one of those assassins creed syndicate I believe is one of those that does have an issue playing it does actually run but their shadows are kind of like strobing a bit it's all glitched out but up the 4000 plus titles that are backwards compatible they said about 115 of those are tagged as um you may experience game behavior or unexpected game behavior while playing this playstation 4 game on your ps5 console so is that why ubisoft had it remember that story a couple weeks ago and we were like maybe ubisoft wasn't running the same version emulator at least that was my theory and ubisoft outed all these games it's not backwards compatible and they pulled it so it sounds like there may have been some like a truthiness in that because okay assassins creed is backwards compatible but or syndicate specifically is backwards compatible but it's got some flaws yeah like for example they talked about some of the other um annoyances that you may run into grip for example you can um it says that there's issues but nothing's really been noticeable everybody's golf there's some flick you're a flickering scenery graphics mainly the trees it could be like how that stuff is being rendered and certain engines um and emulators even going back to like nes emulators have had this issue like um i remember castlevania 3 the vertical scrolling levels were the biggest pain to get emulated for the longest time because they're the way those were being kind of like done was very different and the emulators didn't know how to do it so if you tried to play castlevania 3 early on back in my day in the nes emulator days this was college so yes i was using emulators and playing all sorts of stuff in them um but like you couldn't get past you know the like second part of the first level of castlevania 3 because it was a vertical scrolling part anyway just it's just emulators have always had these problems because they're emulating they're not perfectly the hardware right so just you know um keep in mind that you know you may run into some issues they have a backwards compatibility page that talks about um some of the issues that you may run into but you know it's it's not to say that they are always going to be broken it could be that they fix them down the line but at launch i mean four thousand out of you know um and only having like a hundred of those kind of broken that's not bad so um yeah and then on top of that though um i i don't know if anyone's really asked the question about region locking but apparently the playstation 5 games are also going to be region free which i believe it was the same with the playstation 4 i i'm kind of glad that we've moved past the whole region locking with video games um so hopefully that stays the same but yeah apparently it is been confirmed via their faq's that yes it is still region free so that's good i would assume though the same might not be able to be said about uh all uh placey or i should say uh 4k blu-rays i'm not sure if those are still region locked but at least the games themselves are not hmm how where so i mean region locking thing thing of the past right well yeah we haven't really seen it since uh the playstation 3 i think um on sony side yes nintendo i think 3d wasn't 3ds or ds i feel like it was more recent on the xbox no the xbox 360 was region locked the playstation 3 i cannot remember if that was region locked the thing maybe there might have been some games that were some that weren't um nintendo side i want to say probably the wii u i know that their cartridge games weren't but i don't know if the wii u discs were region locked um obviously i don't think the switch games are but i know 3ds and nintendo ds games were not locked all right well um let's move on then and let's oh actually let me get some quick chat messages here because uh bobby blackwolf says uh note that there's no dolby vision or atmos in playstation 5 and there never will be it seems um he does say it going to say though that 4k uhd blu-rays will pass through fine if you turn on bitstream audio output in the dvd player settings menu and that has to do with a like a licensing thing for that technology probably right i'm assuming well yeah because i know with atmos like i have my headphones i'm wearing right now actually are adobe atmos um and i had to download the app because i had to do that on pc as well i download the app um and put in a serial number that i got with my headphones to be able to use the atmos part of that or the seven one surround sound um but yeah i did the same thing on the series x thankfully it worked without having any troubles like because i was like oh no enter a serial number i don't have that anymore um but thankfully because i purchased it on pc that it remembered it all right well moving on let's talk about something that was all over social media earlier this week when it was happening because this was unfortunately one of those things that was kind of playing out live um and you know that can be both a good thing and a bad thing um good because you can follow along but bad because a lot of stuff kind of gets thrown in that isn't necessarily true and that is the situation that happened with ubisoft montreal earlier this week um a couple days ago uh in the afternoon uh there was a really scary situation that happened there um that uh there was talk on social media about oh my gosh there's like an armed gunman that went into the building and was shooting and all of this well yes and that's the part that social media thankfully got incorrect apparently that was the type of thing that had been called in however the whole thing if you hadn't heard by this point it ended up being a fake 911 call that triggered all these events that happened on friday um so there was a bunch of stuff that was uploaded to twitter and that's why all this kind of like you know talk about what was going on um had happened from um so yeah some folks had been working from home because uh you know the pandemic some were still in the office so some people were tweeting like i know those people on the roof because those are you know my co-workers and stuff um it was it was unfortunately a fake 911 call that appears to be some type of swatting event um that happened which definitely just makes us go like uh it's just it's kind of just disgusting that these swatting events still happen um you know and why was ubisoft montreal targeted um it is very easy to tie that to gaming culture because we've seen the swatting thing happen with you know twitch streams and and things of that sort um and you know it's it's i i shouldn't make that assumption that it's because they're a gaming company and somebody was upset about games that they did this unfortunately track record kind of makes that a safe assumption that it probably was some type of weird somebody trying to prove a point um and you might look at this and go well nobody was hurt um uh do you know the psychological trauma this type of shit can put on people seriously like read the accounts of some people who have gone through this on their social media and stuff like this um there was definitely damage done so this is not an ever oh nobody got hurt hahaha type of situation um when you do this type of swatting stuff i i know i appreciate the choir here with this audience and you guys that are tuning in here are decent enough to know this but i'm gonna say it anyway um you know when you're doing that swatting stuff to you know haha get a rise out of people you are hurting you're intending to hurt and harm people and it's about time that the law really caught up with that and had some really severe punishments um on a on a on a national or at least state level scale um of how that's dealt with now because i'm sure somebody will jump in there and say oh this happened in canada um again i don't i don't know how to eloquently phrase this um but if i am to make any sort of lemonade out of the the lemons that is this news the fact that it happened in canada makes me go well maybe somebody will do something about this swatting thing now you know maybe something will happen from the canadian government to really take a look at this issue how it happened why it happened and look at never making it happen again and then hopefully the u.s can you know use it as a blueprint and other countries too we don't want to just you know focus on north america but this this swatting shit is dangerous and it has to stop um and um yeah i don't know what else to say about that anybody want to add to that i can go to our chat too um act efton chat says uh we know that ubisoft isn't the best company out there but this shouldn't happen to anyone at all yeah no the the reputation and all that stuff if if this had happened to ea comcast whatever like worst company you can think of i would say the exact same thing this is unacceptable period um no one special 77 says plus since the police were tied up in a fake call that was fewer cops that were unavailable for a legit call and in a legit situation where cops weren't there folks could have been easily hurt um you know say a car accident had happened where people were seriously injured somewhere you know you're right that takes police away from the availability to do something like that um so it's um it's gross pod culture says even evil g even evil g absolutely anybody anybody meant anybody so anyway it's an attempt for a party to show power over another party and really it's not just for the recipient um you know who is uh definitely going to be suffering um you know trauma from this but the person themselves it's indicative of serious uh mental health problems that need to be addressed and people have died from it yeah oh yeah oh yeah yeah we heard about the guy that got shot it was horrible it was like the neighbor or something i don't know but it was it was horrible i'm sure that wasn't the only one it's so anyway sorry i don't mean to drag things down i mean at least we can say okay at least it wasn't a shooting situation but it's it's not really honest is it it's not right down yeah it's not really good news so anyway not all news is good it doesn't have to be yeah so the the news doesn't care how it makes you feel it's true the news is news just like science is science no matter what you believe that's true so i'm gonna i'm gonna hope this had nothing to do with gaming culture but i'm gonna know in the back of my mind i'm wrong and it is so anyway we'll see we'll see let's move on how about something that is good news dark soccer how about something a little more light-hearted well this is what i was referring to earlier um my husband's birthday is coming up a couple of days after thanksgiving um we often have to deal with this and i've been racking my brain what am i gonna get him what am i gonna get him and he's like i found myself something and i bought it for myself from you for my birthday okay thanks oops so we have the uh the game and watch handheld the new one um it is basically um in the semblance of the old game and watch it actually isn't doesn't feel as as hefty as an old game and watch you know um but it's got like the color scheme the branding and everything on it but it comes with um a uh uh built-in uh uh lcd screen um that uh hat that will play three different games uh one of them is of course super mario brothers um i had to get i had to like re-familiarize myself with the controller because it feels different than playing it with the nes controller um and then there's super mario brothers 2 which as we know it is lost levels which is basically the i bet you want to cry while playing mario the game um and then the um uh there's ball you remember ball it was i believe the first game and watch game um that uh i don't know i said lcd going back it was the the juggling game with the balls but this time it's got mario's face on it although honestly it looks more like luigi but does it the way they have like the little plates or something like that it's kind of moving back and forth and the different okay it's just little balls and you get them from hand to hand yeah well to be to be honest it is one of the easter eggs but there is a way to get luigi and ball anyway yeah there there's actually video now that shows uh every one of the easter eggs including the uh the image galleries and uh uh the oshi screen and how to you know get a warp pipe and everything and the bowser fights um but at any rate because it is a game and watch it also has the clock built in and the clock has different uh super mario brothers uh scenery uh playing through it i don't know why why is then i'm just sorry i got like a little tongue tied for a moment but basically um you know the time gives you the super mario theme clock and it kind of ticks along with it um and it changes from day to night um with the with the you know with the hours um and is that something that's kind of just meant to be running like on your shelf full time since they have like the clock thing okay well was your was your game and watch meant to run all the time no but it's been 30 years yeah but the with the game and watch is you know if you didn't have a watch with you you could use the watch on your game and watch oh okay i see the game and a watch but at any rate um you know i'm going to say this you know it's it's it's neat you know it actually is a fun little nod it's definitely a novelty sort of thing um and i still thought it was hilarious that ign ranked it higher than the uh than the ps5 and the xbox um why did they do that besides for clicks why what was their what was their justification in that i think fun factor okay yeah but at any at any rate you know it's a really cool little thing it's got some nods you can look at it you know it's it's fun you can play super mario brothers the screen is bigger than the gameboy micro so i mean hey um it honestly though and this is just me um maybe it felt like it was that was a good word for it i guess not super hefty does that make sense yeah like it felt really lightweight i'm not gonna say cheap but it did feel really lightweight and the uh you know the the buttons were you know light everything was just light about it um and and i mean it is pretty much a a gimmick it's a fun gimmick but honestly i kind of want one of those little game gears more than this but dan wanted this and dan got this and it's his birthday so what i want doesn't matter um but i think it is uh pretty pretty cool i'm waiting to see what the hackers do to it you know it's funny you bring that up because bob coffee and chat says it'll be interesting to see if someone hacks it to play other nes games my understanding is and i said it already was yeah i was gonna say i think i saw this on our discord over at vog network.com slash discord i think that's where i saw it um somebody had um posted that it already has been somebody got the like a hacked mario rom on there that actually will show the message hacked so um it's happening i wasn't even looking at chat until you said that bob coffee said something yeah but um but i mean um it's it's a really neat little thing you know i'm glad i'm glad we have it you know it's it's really cute and it's definitely you know we're we're sort of stuck in our hardcore nintendo uh fandomism right now you know i mean dan just the other day says i don't want another system that isn't a nintendo system i'm like oh yeah same kind of right now but and so he was right the next system he bought was a nintendo system a little gimmicky tiny nintendo system but it's cute and it's great and it's a little fun thing and it was kind of fun playing super mario brothers on a game and watch you know even though it's not quite the same size as an old game and watch but um but yeah that's cool and you know if you want you know just something kind of fun to have on the go with a little nostalgia i mean you could do worse yeah i have to admit i totally forgot that that thing was even coming out with you know all the hysteria around the new consoles and trying to order them until i saw like a couple of people on twitter were posting their pictures in the box saying look what i got instead and this is kind of like the same type of thing i'm like oh yeah nintendo was launching a console this week too uh i'll put a picture on my twitter but um yeah i mean in in all kidding aside about nintendo's big console entry into the next generation uh i obviously the switch is still gonna sell like crazy this this holiday because not only is it the switch but it's got a pretty robust library of games so there's still going to be an audience of people that you're going to want to play things like uh breath of the wild mario kart and so forth and now of course the mario kart live as we've seen is is going to probably be a big toy that a lot of kids want and so forth so um yeah and then the game and watch is a nice little entry to the collectibles um kind of interesting to see that that's where nintendo is going from the nes classic and the snes classic everybody was like where's the 64 classic or the game boy classic well we got a game and watch classic which maybe isn't on the top of people's lists but it's maybe something to hold us over for another year or two until one of those other things we talked about are going so thinking that they're really trying to use that nostalgia to bank of course it's almost like and maybe i'm a little bit off base on this one but i'm wondering if it's sort of like nintendo's fundraising right now um well no we just i i think our show got cut off right before this story came up last week but we did have a story on the list about how the switch no i think you might have got to it i don't remember but there was a story about how the switch has outsold the nes already yeah we we were about to get cut off so i just threw it in okay yeah so um that that whole thing was was there so the switch is still selling like crazy so i don't think they need to fundraise but certainly there's going to be the question of well we are a publicly traded company how can we make our investors more money and that's the answer more money if if they did a kirby one i would buy it they'd have to have like a lot of kirby games on it i just want the the the game in kirby um tiger claw and chat says you think they'll do another game and watch of another game um and orange right echoes the kirby answer but also says i think they're definitely going to make more game and watches isn't a major zelda anniversary coming up yes i believe next year would be 30 because this year is 35 for mario right so next year's 35 for zelda or something like that i could i could be off but um i i think uh yeah zelda's zelda's coming up and i wouldn't i wouldn't be surprised though honestly you know what they want to release for zelda's 35th anniversary breath of the wild 2 that's probably going to be next holiday's game and i i think that that's plenty big enough of a zelda anniversary treat so yeah all right well anyhow let's move on we have more stories and uh loki a big one in gaming culture right now right oh yes fun times when we when we're talking about the um the rights of music industry or music holders so the ria and mpa um so anyways twitch you may remember they had a whole dmca fiasco where they were um taking down people's channels um because they had you know copyrighted music in their clips and of course they had really terrible tools for um not even necessarily identifying which you know video you may have had that had that but basically kind of like this nuclear delete everything option was one of the ways to go or you know you could possibly face you know copyright strikes and your channel being deleted so it's really it was only like a mass deletion tool and they only really gave folks you know a few days notice about that so of course they came out and apologized you know saying you know it's basically you know we understand that you're rightly upset with the only option we provided was a mass deletion tool for clips and that we only gave you three days notice to use this tool we could have developed more sophisticated user-friendly tools a while ago that we didn't is on us yeah no kidding you think you live in the same universe that youtube's in you see all the stories about how you know all the copyright stuff they have to go through and you thought that sucks for them and not thinking at all about your own company it's kind of stupid and so of course they said it that was a mistake is or um and we could have provided creators with a longer time period to address their vod and clip libraries that was a miss as well we're truly sorry for these mistakes and we'll do better except you know they're not because that's never going to be the case it's never going to be the end so of course what's going on now well the same stuff you normally see on youtube so for example there was um someone by the name of um makal ronan who said that they had only music they've had on their streams was in-game world of warcraft music played by the game itself yet they've got muted audio on their latest vod because apparently in senjin village um there is the copyrighted music banger called medium windstorm with gus whistles and low rumble from sound effects from hollywood edge sound effects library first off i don't think that those should ever be part of the copyright dmca you know system anyways it's sound effects especially if well okay i i i don't want to spoil but i have to say there is another story in the news this week that is exactly this and for the record sound effects actually do require a bit of engineering and design so yes it is somebody's intellectual property yeah i i can't support it's it's a weird thing i i don't think i can support the fact that you know the sound effects people shouldn't be entitled to their thing but but if it's like i i feel like if it's already in the umbrella of the game that you license especially when the game has said we do not care if you broadcast our game then at some point there's got to be a happy medium there where the streamer is absolved of those incidental sound effects that have happened in the background now if a streamer brings in their own sound board and their own sound effects and starts playing that stuff different that's different and absolutely i think that's fine because and this is why honestly like i'm gonna be honest and this isn't what you guys want to hear but i have always been like i'm not gonna play spotify in the background of my streams and i i i i'll watch streams where people do it and i don't care what other people do but i feel like y'all are on borrowed time like they're gonna come in and stop that and sure enough here we are and people are like what i couldn't play spotify about i couldn't play i couldn't play Madonna while i was playing my games no like i felt like that whole stuff was on borrowed time well however i do think that if the game says you can stream us online then this stuff is in the game and it makes that stuff like guitar hero and music based games in this really weird gray area i get it but i i'm not surprised at the music part of it the sound effect stuff gets a little bit tricky and we've seen on youtube where this gets abused so i also because i don't want to see us make it sound like oh i agree in every single instance no no there's cases where somebody is you know in some third party comes in and sound matches that this happened to one of my youtube videos and um i contested it and it took forever but it was one of those things where it's the principle of the thing you know right i feel like there has to be a way to strike back against incorrect claims well i've seen i've seen some where they've actually there's been a guy whispering or something like that was the clip they made it a private clip and it got copyright claimed for something he's like dude that was my own voice like yeah i don't understand that's why when i'm getting ready to start doing mine i'm going to be doing all the music myself and with my own copyright uh notice on on my youtube channel well that's what's funny it's like there was a thing i saw a video talking about like the copyright system and youtube and stuff and apparently the way someone's gotten around is they make a really terrible and you well not necessarily terrible but like a really unique intro or extro song or outro song and you copy you actually submit that to one of those copyright claim um companies that will actually go out there and flag that and so all of your videos are technically copyright claimed by yourself so it's like huh they can't two companies can't claim the same video allegedly or like it the way the money system works it doesn't allow it to flag it or something like that but basically it would it's not demonetizing and actually this works also for allegedly um monetizing unmonetizable things because you're basically a copyright claiming yourself so you're kind of abusing the system i don't feel so bad for the system to be honest considering how broken it is but that is one way around it that you could do um which i thought was interesting uh also the copyright deadlock that uh jim sterling of course uh famously created was pretty funny uh where two companies fight over the copyright claim for one video and technically two different companies can't claim the same content because no one is the owner then you can't say it's my content and then the other company says oh but that's my content as well it doesn't work that way um the the government is going to have to step in and fix this and modernize these rules and um you know i i don't think that necessarily suddenly happens just because we're going to have a change in the administration because you know there's just there's so many other things i think they're they're looking at and so forth however i will say this one thing we talked about at length a couple weeks ago was the whole like alexandria ocasio-cortez got into live streaming and was doing that among us stream that essentially became a huge like political awareness rally that happened on twitch right and there were other people from other political parties watching that like justin amash who wanted to kind of leverage something like that for himself and so on and so on so i think as you start to see more politicians get into this just wait wait for the day that aoc gets a copyright strike on one of her things that's what it's gonna take the whole copyright system needs to be like redone it's just been abused the hell by disney and other companies ria it they have like these i mean they really should be accounting for fair use um like for example one of the examples of another music thing that was taken down was a cover of a song that someone was covering and they they copyright strike it for the original or um someone using like a five second clip to make a remix or something like that or five second clip of a song for some sort of you know uh comedic effect or something and it gets the whole video gets copyrighted for a five second clip that just seems ridiculous um phoenix 7726 says they won't in the same way twitter never banned trump they can see that coming a mile away except well this when they're running bots and automated shit wait until one of them gets caught up in it like the twitter situation's very different because twitter has had to put a flag on the account that basically says you know never never disable or ban this although somebody did remember that yeah for like three hours well it's just temporarily and it's feeling because it's you know an official channel well not really supposed to be an official channel but it's basically it's a government um communication media or something like that now oh so could the army recruitment twitch get struck um well no because see basically like for example they can't ban people from their channels because it's it's technically like a government entity uh no i'm saying if they play the wrong game could the army get a copyright strike i don't know that's i'm telling you do you really want to anger the army i mean that that's how this and i in in a way i kind of do hope it happens and not in the way you think i'm saying that i'm helping it happens because that is what's going to get the government to move on this stuff and you know modernize the the copyright law and all that stuff so anyway all right but we can't fix copyright law tonight on our uh but just be careful on twitch um i i i don't know what else to say about that um the sound effect thing is really scary and i because you know you don't know what games you thought the the creators are totally cool with you playing on stream and then it's like gotcha you know it's that part's a little bit scary i i that doesn't make any sense it doesn't i i get it like it just seems like a stretch like you know like if you're licensing sound effects like that you you know that you're dealing with certain types of clientele it's not like i don't see how it's wind sounds so obviously you know an ai is not gonna it it's not gonna know if that exactly matches that like i i don't know i just feel like it makes mistakes and even like i've seen stuff you know on youtube for example where they're just filming something outside in the park and it gets copyrighted claim for the wind sounds it's like dude like yeah it's too much too much they're there there needs to be and honestly the my idea you know i'm not a politician my idea is and i've been saying this since the very beginning there needs to be a way to have an effective counter claim where the claimant gets striped so that if they are filing too many claims and they do it overdo it too many times they lose the ability to be able to do it or that's what needs to be in there or better yet that they should basically if you're claiming something you can only claim the section of the video that it's in so if i play a five second clip you're not claiming the whole video you're claiming the five second portion of that video and right now even with youtube and sometimes youtube is a little more specific about what it is that someone's claiming a lot of times those claims could be it's supposed to be specific like this is the section where there's the offending material but it's not a lot of times they're missing that and that is i think something that's supposed to be important about the dmca there's it's supposed to those strikes are supposed to include that and they're also supposed to consider fair use but because these corporations know that there's nothing that you're going to be able to do they you know they don't necessarily have to use fair use i mean we've seen people use dmca strikes to take down vias they just don't like yeah you know yeah and use it as an excuse so it's it's a broken system all right well let me move on i'm gonna get to our next story because i don't want the show to go all night but um let's talk about a bunch of money changing hands somewhere else and that is because take two who of course is the publisher behind you know grand theft auto borderlands you might have heard of them i think loki's a little bit of a fan um take two has acquired code masters code masters of course is a big company out of britain uh that makes a lot of like racing games i believe dirt five is kind of their latest and greatest big title um so uh yeah they're gonna uh join the other labels that take two oversees like 2k games which is you know like the the 2k sports and the civilization and all that rock star games uh and private division so code masters is going to be there uh no words yet as to is there going to be any restructuring or any moving around and things like that um but uh in a comment uh to business wire the boss at take two straus zelnick said that the racing output the code master does is going to fit well with the publishing giant's existing sports fair um and then code masters will benefit from the distribution and marketing at take two so it does kind of sound like it could be a mutually beneficial situation and i don't really see that like these games are going to go anywhere they're going to suddenly put code masters on like a different type of game but i mean we'll see what happens well you know it is take two let's not let's not confuse things i like rockstar games i don't necessarily like take two okay two is just about as bad as ea and activision they are going to monetize the crap out of this stuff um well good for code masters at least you know that's a little bit more exposure i guess for their games but it's just going to be a mess i mean just look at wwe and you know mba 2k to get an idea of what take two likes to do with their franchises i mean so it's uh best of luck to them all right good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor all right moving on on a different note dar sakura well you know i like to talk about um video games being used for for good um and cambridge uh the cambridge researchers um actually put together a um a game that's supposed to help people online learn how to debunk uh fake news i hate using the term fake news but meant to debunk disinformation um how to recognize uh you know legitimate information versus misinformation um game is called harmony square and it's just a simple web game um you basically are uh shown a a news story um it it has like four different decision-based chapters to help you master these different techniques um on how to spread fake news and troll and then you will can you will master those techniques and learn then what it is that's prompting people to believe these things and for you to evaluate your own feelings and your own triggers to make yourself think more critically and it actually works um they tested it with 700 participants and then um you know they had them rate headlines and social media posts prior to this um and then they had half of them play harmony square and they have a half to play tetris and after it was huh no i'm just laughing giggling at the the control group in that case and so they they had them do it again with different headlines and then with their conclusion um that i'm going to quote the perceived reliability of misinformation of the participants who played harmony square reduced to 16 um and their willingness to share those things reduced by 11 and and even so i mean that's you know saying that if that with that population split down the middle um 63 of that half that played it would find misinformation significantly less reliable this is actually from the report um compared to 237 of the left half to navigate online information without the inoculation of harmony square and you can um go to harmony square dot game and try it for yourself interesting and i'm sorry i might have missed it at the beginning is this is this a game for kids or adults or like all ages everybody okay it's just i i you know when i hear something like this i'm kind of like this is the type of stuff i hope they're teaching kids in like high school or junior high you know this is this is stuff like unfortunately that's where our society has evolved and um i know we were playing things like oregon trail and number munchers and math blasters and stuff when we were younger and i think there's still room for games like that um but like this is the type of thing i hope they're using in school because unfortunately in this day and age uh that is not a skill that is learned by everybody is how to not fall for bullshit uh and there's a lot of bullshit on facebook and insert social media platform here so some yeah um no one special 77 in chat makes a little joke saying cambridge needs to make 13 games to teach folks how to point out clickbait articles game number seven will surprise you that's that's pretty good no one special in in your uh history of joke making here on this program that's that's one of the better ones so kudos to you all right but i i i i do love and dark soccer i'm glad you brought that story up because i do love that idea of gamification or gamifying and gamification of a topic uh we need to be educating more about and talking about for sure so whether whether whatever term you want to use for it you know bullshit on social media is something we need to as a society get stronger in dealing with so the the other thing too is that i i think of it like this that maybe it's a little bit sad that we have to use a game to teach because people won't by themselves educate themselves does that make sense people don't want to be educated they want to be entertained right and that is honestly a social disease um since i have i think no well i'll just say since i've done a lot with educating over the years i can see how games can sometimes work as an application method because you know some people are going to learn by listening to the lecture some people are going to learn by visually but with pretty charts and graphs or reading in a book something with their eyes but a lot of people learn by doing and i kind of feel like games i mean yes they're games but they're a way to learn by doing um especially when it comes to things that are more like soft skills as opposed to put widget a on top of widget b you know in that type of application like a game of this sort can be an application of it when you present a game with the purpose of educating covertly people aren't going into it expecting to learn something but when you are in you know a classroom environment and you're doing supplemental you know exercises or games people are there knowing that they're there to learn and that this is i'll be honest i hate in class games i just want you to give me the information let me learn it let me go um you know it is so funny because all of my trainers where i work know this about me now and they're just like did you already finish the modules like i finished all the days modules can i can i finish um but uh but back to that you know it's some people do need it but when they know that they're being educated it's a different thing if it is a game presented hey play this it's fun and then they learn something from it that it's not what they think the primary purpose of it is then and you know if you if you like hey this thing is is a problem and we need to learn how not to do it if you give that to them they're gonna be like i guess i don't care versus hey here's this game to play oh wow i learned something from this game i didn't expect it to happen you know what i mean yeah that's a completely different thing like yeah i i am by the way i'm alert by doing myself i just hate those exercises because i know that that's all it is i would rather you just give me the information and let me figure it out i get the perspective of the i might pleasantly learn something while playing a game like take a game like civilization you might actually learn something about history and world leaders playing that game but that's not not why you signed up to play does that make sense so yeah all right all right well let's move on and let's um go to loki with our next story yeah so this is pretty cool like i know uh they did the similar things with different valve games i can remember like portal and portal 2 had these in-game commentaries but now half-life alex also shares that as they've now received um three hours of commentary in that game so you can actually check it out within the game itself and it kind of talks about the behind the scenes and a development process of the game itself including 147 points of interest to find and uh talking about the hands-on nature of uh their narration and it's also available in several different uh languages if you want subtitles so that's pretty awesome as well um pretty cool i i still haven't finished this game so i really do need to go back and play more half-life alex because it's pretty awesome but i do like the commentaries that were in there as well they're always very interesting okay i was gonna ask because i have to admit i don't know if i've played a video game with the commentary on and i was kind of curious and opening it that this question of the chat as well how many of you have played through video games with the commentary on so you you have done this loki yeah i played through a little bit of portal i think and i think that they had portal 2 had the same thing but you can actually go through that and uh check it out and they have these like little icons on the screen you go up to and it talks about like especially with the original portal like different puzzle designs and stuff like that so it's pretty cool i've watched a couple of movies with commentary tracks but very few and i've always found that they're almost always better if there's more than one person when there's just one person it's not always the most exciting thing in the world it depends on who it is and i feel like some people don't want to be there but others do so it really um kind of changes that uh no one special 77 says when i still had a ps3 and the orange box for that i tried the commentary for that like i've probably like tried it but i don't think i've ever like actually said oh there's a commentary track out for this game i want to try it so it's interesting um sg100 matt says i haven't experienced this enough i get the sense i would do that on a second playthrough you know what if something like mass effect had a commentary track i'd probably play through with it but there's so much that that game is so long i'm not sure if a commentary track would really work but it'd be interesting so all right it'd be cool if like games like that let you create a custom commentary track like we could create one in game and like store different like clips here like hey you probably don't want to go around the corners jump scare over there just just beware jump scare right there well that's what you do in demon souls you leave the little pieces of paper at least i think you still do that anyway all right uh moving on uh i'm sure a lot of you saw this floating around social media this week and it's it's like the ridiculous like what the hell are you doing with these consoles and um so in this case did everybody see that video of the xbox series x where smoke was coming out of the top of the vent and it was that youtube that was like omg my xbox series x on launch day caught fire well you can very clearly see in the corner there's smoke going into the xbox that then comes out of the holes on the top because yes somebody actually was blowing vape smoke into the vent at the bottom which of course smoke rises fun fact science and it came well at the top it's also because they developed that console to have nice airflow so it just sucks it up and spits it right out which is why the playstation 5 is also shaped the way it is is that it's to help with the airflow so you know both these consoles with their you know beefy parts that are doing all the fancy ray tracing and everything have to have really good airflow in it so honestly the vape smoke technique is showing wow the airflow is really good on these systems um yeah and i like i like the comment though that they had on like i can't believe i have to tell you this but yeah don't blow vape smoke into your xbox series x xbox actually put out a tweet uh a few days ago on november the 11th so i was actually the day before uh the day after the launch where they said we can't believe we have to say this but please do not blow vape smoke into your xbox series x but that just goes that also goes all into like the fake news type of thing we were just bringing up is that this person only did it to get clicks on omg and that that can have a negative impact on xbox because somebody's going to believe it like you got to see this video where a dude's micro thing caught fire people like chasing clout yeah i know yeah and as and as mentioned in chat by bobby yeah and also vape smoke can hurt your xbox like let's you know let's let's not forget that part is that you know there's what makes the vape smoke there's a little bit of water in there and stuff right you should not be putting those on computer parts and and i mean we should probably also ignore obviously i didn't watch any videos like this but i'm it they're always out there there's always the people that are smashing these new systems when they came out because you know four clicks because haha you can't get one i got one and now i'm gonna break it you know it's like i don't know whatever people are dumb whatever happened to the video where here's my brand new xbox series x but here's my knife uh-huh it's a cake like i thought that's where we were at in 2020 where's my xbox series x is actually a cake like where's that or playstation five i'll take that would have been a twist like oh hey look my xbox series x is on fire it's because it's a cake uh no unfortunately we're not there yet i don't know why i'm obsessed with those cake videos that are like surprise it's a case that i know it's a cake going in but i'm always kind of like wow these are like really well done cakes you know all right let's go let's go back to a simpler time when in fact it was not a cake it was it was just a game the classic game of the week it wasn't a cake it was a lie uh dark soccer is gonna step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks hey uh you should be checking out this game this week uh and this is oh man you've got a classic tonight it's one of those ones where it's like how has this never been picked before yet again here we are what i texted you yeah it is it is and that's why i'm saying it again what's funny as i was describing this to dan is the game where you run around in pajamas and shoot people's livers and spleens because that's kind of what they look like that is so the classic game of the week is uh alien syndrome so uh it is a running gun it was developed by sega and it came out in the arcades in 1987 um so basically you uh have two soldiers that you play as one named ricky and one mary and they go through this levels that will have a way scrolling and you have to rescue your comrades who are being held by aliens who uh well they look like spleens and livers to me green and and pink very pink looking organ meat um anyway um so uh after you rescue a certain number of hostages uh an exit will open and you can go through to fight you know the boss for the level the the end of level guardian as this likes to say and then when you've defeated it then you're able to go on to the next stage um and it does allow two players simultaneous um and you can do pickups to assist the character get different weapons get maps of the level um and you know it's it's a very very simple game that people can be kind of all up in arms about versions of it um so um the game uh had different ports um in 1988 its first series of ports were on the sega master system the msx the amiga atari st the amstrad cpc commodore 64 and the uh famicon or nes that was published by tangen because nintendo would grant the license um there were later ports there was the zx spectrum in 1989 game gear in 1992 and oh gosh i wish i owned one of these a sharp x68000 in 1992 which was the only arcade perfect port because i mean it was fucking sharp x6800 what you by sixty eight thousand what would you expect um so and honestly it was just like it was sort of that era of you know of games right where it kind of had just like that almost minimalist kind of music to it and it was kind of simple but a little bit more complex than the other things you know it was it was just a really cool game um it was uh listed as uh one of as the third most successful arcade unit um by a game machine in japan it was listed that um in 1987 in their article on it um the original version was also uh reviewed by computer and video games uh magazine in 87 it was called one of the most gripping games they've been playing for months um and it was very reminiscent of of alien or uh you know or aliens i should say i mean i i honestly see more in common with alien than aliens but um you know and it also uh the master system version was actually given really really high ratings as well um so the game did get um uh an upgrade um for the ps2 uh sega ages 2500 uh series um and uh it was brought over in the us in the sega classics collection um however it was ruined for the european version to get a lower age certificate they upgraded controls they uh gave it polygon graphics um analog controls um and they did include the original game as an unlockable in sonic's ultimate genesis collection um the thing is is that the sadly the sega ages version is not very good it really is not very good um there was a sequel also called alien syndrome that was released on wii and psp in 2007 and so there you go alien syndrome you know shoot shoot the alien headed thing shoot the livers and you know spleens that try to come at you it's kind of gauntlet-y you know with with aliens and spleens so there you go all right sorry i stepped away for a second but i'm back uh yes alien syndrome uh a game that uh i played this on the nes i think i remember the tengan cart for this uh and playing that so uh and it was hard i remember but maybe i'm better at games now i don't know i think that we may be now this is actually something i'm gonna go a little bit into it um i think that um it may not necessarily be a better or worse our perception's different and we're gonna try to do one thing one way when we're a kid but when you go back and play it when you're older you sometimes try to follow that old instinct but you think something else is gonna make sense and i think that's just a difference in a gaming as a mature gamer that's very true you know something like like mega man is very much a game about patterns right like you've often talked about your um ability to play a certain section of mega man to all of us ability yeah like blindfolded because it's really it's really just a game about memorizing patterns if you think about it but being able to execute those patterns perfectly um and i think some of that is probably true with what i'm watching here on aliens it's been a long time since i played this game but um i and what i'm watching in the footage here is i'm like it's really just it seems like it's just patterns like this person knows exactly where they're running exactly what they're shooting um and there's like a pattern thing to it before i didn't say if it was a task play yeah uh um maybe but but i mean this is still the thing too is that with the older games like this they're a lot of them more patterns are you know there's not really as much i'd say uh programming real estate to have a more complicated ai in games like this good point yeah so and it doesn't look like and as far as i'm aware i don't think this particular game has a whole lot of rng to deal with short of boss battles so all right well a real classic there uh your classic game of the week alien syndrome uh originally in the arcade and then pretty much everywhere else at the time and that large list the dark sakura read us earlier all right well let's get into some rapid fire news and travel around the world and uh we'll look at world release dates right after but first some rapid fire news uh loki we'll start with you uh yes so there's lots of fun news regarding sam and max's week including a brand new uh remaster that's going to be coming to pc and switch uh this december so sam and max save the world remastered uh looks pretty awesome and um yeah i'd like some more sam max and with that i'm probably gonna get some more sam and max because they're gonna be uh coming to vr as well with sam and max uh this time it's virtual and it's a brand new vr game that's coming out as well in early 2021 so i am definitely gonna be picking that up um and i believe bobby blackwolf is a big fan of this news too yes yes these are some of his favorite things all coming together um and then of course like a lot of news i'm going to bring up another game title and of course it's going to be um well actually this time not delayed but we at least know when it's coming out so that's going to be a death loop which is going to be coming out may 21st 2021 and they are charging uh sixty dollars instead of seventy i didn't really realize that was a thing that originally they were going to charge seventy for it i know that activision and take two two of the evilest companies known to man are charging seventy dollars watches and say sony is doing the same thing as well um charging seventy dollars for their games hopefully that doesn't stick but at least we know that it's gonna be um you know not that it's gonna be sixty dollars instead it looks like a great game uh it's still only on uh playstation though that's it all right well let's talk about fall guys are y'all still playing fall guys um well some new costumes might bring you back to take another look and it's a tie-in with the untitled goose game or asshole goose game as i still call it uh honk uh the crossover event is going to be happening on november 13th uh and they did a whole twitch stream where you could actually see the costumes early and i think they actually had like staff people like dressed up as the geese so that's really silly but um yeah so that actually i'm sorry november 13th would have been friday so it's already in the game now um so you can check that out that is also the launch of season 2.5 that just happened this past week uh there is now a big fan level for that uh there's some uh mixed up rounds as well and now a hammer called lil yeety because the hammer if it hits you you're gonna go i haven't played this in a while i haven't had to go back they've been doing some cute little upgrades to it it's it's it's probably something worth checking out if you haven't seen it in a while so uh check that out do your kids do that yeet i hear that's a big thing with kids uh yes yes the kids do that do they play fall guys no they're on to among us well at least um my oldest son's on among us and still roblox his thing now what he's been doing is he's been making um like i don't know

news um and then uh phoenix 77 26 says we need president cat too you know as an aside you might remember years ago it was four years ago during the last election i think we had the guy on who made cat president which is on steam um we had him on the show uh because we thought it was funny that somebody actually made a game about cats and presidents though of course he'd never heard this show i mean who can blame him hardly anyone has so uh what i want to say though is that he did come out with just in the past couple months cat president too which just in time for the 2020 election was out and i want to say because i follow him on twitter i want to say his twitter just said that they did like a an extra update recently was it to add the four seasons landscaping thing i think it might have been i think they added some type of parody on the land yeah so it yeah cat president to a per political revolution yes so the free plug for that guy what was i i can't the guy's name i think was paul it was oh oh a rock i remember yeah oh a rock i remember that was funny but uh free plug for cat president too uh we love our indie developers um dark tetsuya says you know jordan got out of the gaming industry so i don't know what even happened to president cat ip uh olr is willing to buy the president cat ip just i want to throw that out there um we don't have a lot but you guys have been very generous with your bits and subs so i'll tell you what i'm willing to pay twenty dollars for the president cat license um i'll just give it to yyr or even uh oh a rock if they want it but uh yes we're looking we're looking for that please um or wouldn't that wouldn't that specifically be renna because we we were the ones that said jamie specifically was one that said president cat because it's really like it was boss cat it was a joke yeah it's it's more like like the delinquent girl girl leader boss yeah and i was like i was trying to wrap my knee my head around what it meant i was like president president cat no because i need to stick him on you know i because it's like a whole subculture no i'm it was beautiful the way it was it's the only time the show has ever been famous jamie so kudos to you oh that and the katamari thing so you know we need a stunt it's been like 14 years can't we where's our fucking stunt to get us famous again hold on let me go get my vape pen all right all the can't also think of something i guess all right yeah oh yeah yeah yeah make a game loki okay i'll get right on that thank you it's about time a stunt game all right let's bring us notoriety all that from the alpaca ball moving on dark soccer's got some rapid fire news for us hold on yeah i do um so i'm sorry sorry to interrupt so this is important it's it's it's yes the patch 105 for the fur seasons all right thank you for that all right sorry jamie so uh konami style which is konami's record label is doing a tennis compilation a series called music from konami arcade shooting god i want this um it's got um 10 discs and the first one is morning music twin b gradius salamander life force flak attack this too is ajax gradius 2 thundercross 3 is bradius 3 proteus 4 is trigon detana twin b thundercross 2 disc 5 is sexist uh gokujo parodius 6 is twin b yahoo salamander 2 7 is sexy parodius 8 is uh tobe poly stars and solar assault revised 9 is gradius 4 ultimatius and finalizer and 10 disc is bonus tracks and range tracks um yes somebody buy that for me please i specifically wanted you to talk about that tonight because i wanted that reaction of i want it well and the other thing is that people go oh why is it digital because digital music does not sell as well in japan as physical media so okay also um for people who are still into pokemon sapphire a fish beat pokemon sapphire after 3195 hours so um basically they have fish swimming around um and they use motion tracking on them so uh these fish uh beat beat pokemon why are we reporting this because it's that awkward moment when a fish has more gamer credibility than i do well basically i think it's also to demonstrate you know i like actually this particular article brings it up because it was the first thing i was thinking of was the uh the infinite monkey theorem that states if you have a monkey hitting keys on a typewriter for an infinite amount of time it'll eventually type out a shakespeare play um that was all that that also goes back to the twitch place pokemon phenomenon from a few years ago was in that exact same thing was cited the whole and i've heard it also as the broken clock is right twice a day type of thing it's that same type of theory but on a much larger scale so interesting all right uh let's move on and travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games that your fish might beat very soon or in 3000 days or whatever it took uh loki let's start in the us all right so in the us we've got bubble bobble for friends the baron is back on playstation 4 and nintendo switch mortal combat 11 ultimate on pc nintendo switch playstation 4 playstation 5 xbox one and xbox series x uh we have serious sam collection on nintendo switch playstation 4 and xbox one sniper elite 4 on nintendo switch bridge construction bridge constructor the walking dead on ios android uh pc mac and linux i'm sorry i'm gonna cut loki off because he cut jamie off earlier but this chat comment is worth reading see a tiberian chat says it was the best of times it was the blurst of times that's a simpsons joke isn't it i know it there and it's that whole thing with the monkey and the typewriter they're typing something and that's that's what he pulls out it was the best of times it was the blurst of times oh yeah i remember that look i don't even really i probably haven't watched simpsons in like 20 years and yet i recognize that so there's that okay sorry loki you can continue all right uh let's see where were we so um it's also coming out on nintendo switch playstation 4 xbox one xbox series x uh we also have um some more uh looks like the bubble games also coming out on uh playstation 4 as well even though i said playstation 4 previously i'm guessing maybe one's a physical version one's not uh we have also uh moral combat 11 coming out on stadia uh star renegades on nintendo switch and xbox one hyrule warriors age of calamity on nintendo switch katamari damasi reroll on playstation 4 and xbox one and that would be it all right let's go to japan virtually uh and check out the release dates over there on november 19th on nintendo switch we have momotaro densetsu showa he say reiwa mo taiwan comes out as well as oh my god i should really look at these in advance there is legit there is legit a game coming out on the nintendo switch called panty party perfect body that's right yeah panty party and i you know guess guess what's on the box art school girls and guess what one of them is showing just a little flash of see the game's title uh that's great now it does come with a warning there is no warning no hentai content in this game all you get is funny and stupid pennies okay i think that's a review somebody wrote about olr on itunes um you know apparently according to this um it has been released over here as well um that's it really last year what was it called panty party it's also called panty party yeah it's uh fifteen dollars on your switch all right then this must be some type of like if it's called perfect body it must be like a remaster or something that's on the switch so anyway all right let me try to just i just i was i there was nothing that could have prepared me for that uh moving on neko tomo smile mashimashi comes out this week uh gal gun 2 gets a price reduction as it goes into the best hits um looking at some of the other systems oh i have playstation 5 to look at in japan now huh um so let's see so the console itself already released we we didn't get to this part of the show last week i don't think we have any games this week just that the playstation 5 itself is coming to other regions in asia because remember there was the weak delay um and uh jamie will get to it because it affects europe as well uh but it also impacted asia um otherwise playstation 5 has nothing this week i imagine they've uh you know kind of put out all the stuff the week the system came out uh for a little while uh looking at the playstation 4 though just because they're still going to release things on that for a little while yep katamari damasi reroll gets a release in japan uh this week on the 19th uh sniper elite 4 is also out in japan and a new edition of black desert the prestige edition oh bubble bobble for friends also out in japan this week there you go that was a lot dark soccer how about the uk oh in the uk we have um on the 17th mortal combat 11 ultimate um sniper elite 4 fortnite the last laugh bundle truck driver for switch um on the 19th warhammer chaos bane slayer edition wrc 9 for ps5 um man eater for ps5 um professor uh rubik's brain fitness uh monster trunk championship uh dirt 5 for ps5 and the ps5 um we have watchdogs legion we have on the 20th we have eldridor creatures theme park simulator uh not extended uh edition code in a box hyrule warriors age of calamity uh sakuna of rice and ruin that's what's coming out all right let's move on we have some more stories for you guys i think it's very important that we elaborate on that game one more time um oh boy so taking a look at it so it's literally like flying underwear that you're fighting as it is a 3d like fighting like action game where you play as sentient underwear apparently it looks ridiculous uh phoenix 77 26 wants to know is chris hanson an unlockable character well no it's it's not really people there's no people in the game it's just flying underwear all right uh well let's move on loki why don't you uh start us off with some more actual news all right let's talk about it um so apparently there japan uh sony is gonna stop servicing the original playstation 4 which seems quite surprising considering that um i mean we just got the playstation 5 apparently they're what they're talking about is the original version of the playstation 4 that launched back in 2014 they are gonna stop servicing but the slim and pro series they're gonna still do repairs and whatnot on those um it's just the original model which still though it seems like it's a pretty soon to stop um supporting that but you can do whatever they want at least they know what a playstation 4 is and having completely forgot about it thank you vita the headlines on this i think were a little deceptive too because it was saying like playstation 4 is no longer services well it's some it's the launch so but it definitely uh it does seem pretty aggressive to be on its way out the door you know what i mean like the five just came out you know exactly i i think it's a bit soon and considering that you know people are probably getting rid of their playstation fours for playstation fives i mean they don't want to deal with the second hand maybe maybe i don't know but i haven't i haven't decided if i want to keep my xbox one or maybe get rid of it um i just don't know who won it this one you you want do you not have an xbox one dark sakura oh i thought you guys had one no we got ps4 let's talk if i mean i at least want to borrow it yeah if you know what honestly yes i would be fine with you in this way you don't have to give me money because i would be fine with it having a long-term home um because when we move eventually i'll probably set it up as a secondary media player but i don't really have the space right now so i'll be honest our ps3 and ps4 are both connected we use the ps4 for youtube and we use the ps3 for uh the few times we actually watch physical disc um not just oh bobby says i know some parents who want an xbox one because i can play minecraft well jamie if you if you really want let's let's talk because i i can uh do that i'm a cat parent that wants to play minecraft well to be fair everything plays minecraft nowadays so it's fine that's true too um anyways just speaking of which jamie um i guess uh you're gonna go ahead and bow out for the night just to take care of yourself and because you've been a little under the weather so uh and we could hear we could hear it you're starting to go during the release dates so um uh thank you of course for sticking it out and being here tonight glad glad you got to have a full show tonight sort of sorta i mean without the i'm referring to the power drops last week or god internet drops last week the goal is with uh another week of resting my voice that i will be 100 so fingers crossed but i i would also still like to take the opportunity to tell people pay the fuck attention to what cdc is telling you wear your mask social distance don't fucking go to anybody's house for thanksgiving just saying yeah unless you've all been tested we're doing we're doing the two-week stay at home thing so we can see my dad but that is it we are only seeing my dad so but like i can't let him be alone i can't so yeah i understand i'm taking i'm actually taking a test on uh monday to to test myself again they sent me three boxes of tests from work i'm like why you already tested me yeah all right take care of yourself jamie we'll talk to you in a week thanks bye all right moving on let's get to our next story where we talk about youtube premium and i gotta fix the cameras here real quick though sorry awkward transition all right there we go all right um let's talk about a free google stadia but the catch is you have to be a youtube premium member so you get the 99 bundle that features a chromecast ultra and a gamepad if you are a youtube premium member this is for members in the us and the uk you get the stadia premiere edition a 99 bundle with the chromecast ultra and stadia controller and uh yeah you get that and then you get a free month of stadia pro with that but you have to remember to cancel that or they're gonna get you on that um so i'm sure this is where people want to insert the joke that they can't even give it away well you know what like i well for one stadia is supposed to be free anyway so like you know what are you getting you're getting the chromecast ultra that's kind of like the first level of doing this but the weird thing is um alan has been like a youtube subscriber for a long time um and he couldn't get one it said he wasn't eligible for it i didn't get that but google has also given away quite a few things both alan and i have google homes well we have obviously we have two in the house one in the bedroom in the living room because of our spotify subscriptions and they gave away a free google with that or his might have even come from a cell phone i don't remember but google has definitely given their stuff away before i don't know what do you what do you think about them giving away stadia chromecast and all that for free loki i mean i guess they figured if you're buying their youtube premium service that you're probably ripe to you know be interested in such a terrible service as stadia um no i i don't know it's it sounds like a last ditch effort to try to get people either hooked on youtube premium or stadia i i just think they're gonna have to change their model at some point to make it more like games pass but i don't know we'll see um it sucks that he's not able to redeem that considering he would be a subscriber to you know um yeah i don't know what your premium the weird hold up is i have to look into what kind of error message he's getting or whatever but anyway um and some comments here uh did you rama s in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says damn google is desperate to get rid of them um maybe but remember here's the thing stadia is supposed to be free anyway but the weird the missing part here is that how how far are we into the launch of stadia and we still don't have that version that you just sign on to the web and play unless you are a pro subscriber right or am i mixing that up can you just go on with any old gmail account and do it now on the web i don't know you could do it with pro but i don't think you could do it with just like a free one um so it's it's just the whole thing's a little weird um i just feel like google just flood this launch so bad i don't know um pixel pocket says i'm very sad about google play music i downloaded all my stuff and put it on my plex server instead i forgot they just recently shut that down that's right um i think i had a bunch of olr episodes on there a bunch of old ones so um yeah uh st100 matt says they want to get folks to get it so they can release that gotta have stadia game which they don't have yet so it'll be interesting to see the effect this has i know people that are cashing in on it because hey free chrome cast right it's not just a stadia it's a chrome cast so i know people that are cashing in on it is it some type of maybe trojan horse trick i don't know especially when they talk about signing you up for a free month the stadia pro i i don't know but it'll be interesting to see what kind of impact this might have on stadia if any so i would i still think it's just their core service isn't worth paying for i mean it just doesn't paying for the service and then i have to also buy the games on the service doesn't make any sense it's just especially when there's other companies offering stuff it it's just cheaper and like i i don't get what the the value proposition is that they're saying especially since there's not new really i mean aside from there's nothing really exclusive to that platform either like i just don't get what they are hoping to do with this like i i don't know oh now this is a service again die dgrms says alan couldn't get it because the promotion for it ran out so people in chat are asking how do i get in on this it sounds like you might it's all have been claimed the end so interesting brilliant i wonder if this was all just a trick to get out get us all to talk about it i don't know but it would be great if they could put out like that killer game that would i know i'm totally getting stadia now that i've talked about it yeah all right uh moving on to another story and uh this has to do with uh the the not twitch con is going on right now the glitch con or whatever um and this is some i i didn't really catch a lot of big twitch news out of that i i like a big new feature coming or anything like that maybe you guys did and can correct me in chat and that feature is that they're gonna start flagging your games for wins besides all of that besides all of that letting that go for a minute um well one of the big stories that came out of it was that um the co why can't i read this article here okay the co of able gamers who's uh pretty popular on social media uh steven spon i hope i said his last name right sorry um but he's the co of able gamers and this charity has been around a while it's actually um the charity that my amazon smile is set to for what it's worth and they're they do a lot of great things for gamers with disabilities um in in video games and one of the cool things that happened uh out of glitch con was that uh the co steven had wanted to for his birthday because he just hit his 40th birthday i believe wanted to raise one million dollars for the able gamers charity and um twitch just said here you go here's a million bucks for able gamers so there's your goal and then some so that's pretty awesome uh and that all happened during a stream with dr lupo and the ceo of twitch uh emmett shear uh and that twitch is going to donate one million dollars to able gamers that is pretty awesome uh and it's interesting because uh steven has said on twitter i've talked to the rock i've talked to ryan reynolds i'm paraphrasing this is not exact words i've talked to the rock i've talked to ryan reynolds but that is the one that caught me caught me off guard so that is cool great charity good news we like gaming good news all right i'm trying to look in chat to see if anybody had said uh uh bobby blackwolf says that's nice of them considering twitch just laid off their accessibility manager i guess it's easier to give money to charity than actually do any accessibility work but true which did you catch my subtle segue to our next story logi yes i it was so subtle so uh we got to hear from tommy talarico this week and you may be wondering what the hell does that have to do with roblox well it's because apparently uh roblox corporation um lifted a little bit of his sound effects uh or sound design from an old game called messiah back in 2000 and thought no one would notice but apparently someone did and so there was uh some stuff behind the scenes and they finally settled to where uh the game the game is no longer not gonna have that oof uh sound effect for free um so what's happening basically is tommy talarico is going to allow them to have that sound effect back in the game if you are a creator of games on roblox you can actually purchase the sound effect to use in your games for 100 um robux i think it's like a dollar and then on top of that he's also going to be creating some new sound effects that you could also use in your games as well ranging anywhere from like 10 bucks to 250 dollars depending on the number of sounds that are included with it so it's available to developers on there also he is uh working with the roblox corporation to create an official oof t-shirt they're gonna sell them sure he's gonna get proceeds from uh but basically yeah the whole thing's been settled without uh seems like a lawsuit um but yeah that was kind of interesting that they've been well i wouldn't say it's interesting because if you've played roblox or of browse through roblox you'll know that because a lot of the developer a lot of these games are created by kids kids have no concept of copyright law or i mean this is literally just a bomb waiting to go off as far as ip theft goes it's just ridiculous and so it's not surprising that at the heart of the game more ip theft my my understanding of how that all happened was that you know when they made roblox they kind of got like a uh one of those like a 1000 sound effects licenseable for your thing or whatever and i'm i'm i don't know those exact details but it's one of those like you know license a bunch of sound effects and the oof was included in there and oof it shouldn't have been because it wasn't licensed from tommy or anything like that it was essentially stolen so roblox thought that they had licensed it appropriately but it sounds like this middle person uh is the one that's really to blame whoever had ripped it off for their collection so interesting yeah so at least there is no harm no foul but they've worked on you know uh some fair resolution for it uh no one specials on fire tonight uh pixel pakka says official oof t-shirt lol to which no one special 77 chat replies it's an official t-shirt nice yeah so you've been listening to orange lounge radio sorry i had to i had to do the roll credits on the bad joke all right go ahead are we gonna see uh are we gonna see any uh roblox heading to the amico or anything like that now that tommy's uh mixed that would be a gag that would be a gag but i believe that the um the rule on amico is that everything has to be for amico and exclusive to it i mean they could maybe dance around and have some type of uh official uh roblox side game or version but um who knows anything's possible i guess yeah all right one more story for you guys before we get to the round table let's talk about plague inc this game has uh been talked about especially this year i can't imagine why but um there's a new mode that they launched uh just in time where you try to stop a pandemic do you think it's easy boys and girls well now you can try uh through plague inc so uh this new mode called the cure mode you have to find a balance between contact tracing that scene research helping to save the economy locking down as appropriate and so forth uh to try to bring the end of a pandemic and if you figure it out call the white house um and let them know because uh they might need some help but yeah so interesting is that it's the reverse of what plague inc kind of was before is that you actually wanted to spread a virus to wipe out humanity so this is the the more hopeful version of that to go for 2020 so i think that's kind of interesting it's cute that the game's been turned on its head like that so have you ever played this game loki i have to admit i haven't no i have i've heard a lot about it uh certainly because of what's been going on this year so i imagine there'll be some streams and things like that so all right um let's get to the listener roundtable we're going to invite your questions and comments uh to our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network also um this is the part of the show where we get into the mailbag now this week we didn't have any emails however because last week's show got cut off early thanks to the internet we actually had some emails from last week we never got to so i do want to read these two emails but i am going to warn you guys um it may be a little dated because we're now two weeks from when they were sent um but let's get to our first email tonight which is from i believe this is no one special although it's unsigned uh all right here we go hi all i hope all is well with you this week since it's been a while since my last email i thought i'd send one this week uh plus unless i think of something at the last second sending this email negates the need for me to send one of my long-winded listener roundtable subjects so while this isn't wholly email worthy i do have some good news to report so for brevity's sake i'll tldr this despite it being incredibly late and i have giving up any hope of getting it i will finally get that 1200 stimulus check in about a week i got a call from my ssdpe the other day stating that she just received it on my behalf since stimulus checks went out to wherever people who are on social security have their federal monthly checks sent and when her agency mails out checks this week she'll forward the money to me now i'm imagining that there's a chance that at least one of you are asking yourselves okay good for you what does this relate to gaming after all olr is a show about gaming well to be fair it's a show about gaming and tangents good point i'm getting to that as i've mentioned from time to time in the past one thing i've always wanted was an honest to goodness arcade cabinet something like a classic game from the 80s or 90s be it any version of street fighter 2 one of the 2d mortal combat games cruisin usa a neo geo mvs etc even with 1200 i still can't afford one of those unfortunately they are closer to 2500 or 3000 at the least so that being said i'm going to bite the proverbial bullet and buy the arcade one up version of the neo geo mvs from amazon linked to the amazon page now before i go any further i don't recall arcade one up doing a neo geo no it's snk actually thank you okay that's what i thought so snks actually themselves however it is it is probably happening due to the success of arcade one up and i'm sure we have arcade one up to thank for this coming out and it's very much in a similar vein to the arcade one up machines but i do just want to make that clarity point is that arcade one up themselves is not the one doing it but you wouldn't necessarily know by looking okay so um that all being said let me finish email maybe if i can swing it i'll also order a few things from my pc on top of the neo geo mvs like new ram new controller and so forth but that last part aside despite it not being perfect like not an actual arcade machine that would accept quarters and tokens and have cartridge slots i'm still excited to have the next best thing i do have a two-part question for you all have any of you at a minimum had an opportunity to try the arcade one up version of the neo geo mvs um i'm gonna rephrase that to what we just discussed and if so what are your thoughts on it pros and cons i haven't i didn't even know it was out i thought it was coming out but he did link us to an amazon page where ah okay this item will be released on november 24th so that's the answer none of us have played it yet because we can't it's not out yet um well uh i've seen like video reviews from folks that have are familiar with the mvs and um have played a lot of that through like a super gun or something like that and talking about what it is in it sounds like it's pretty good as far as mimicking the mvs and um the only complaints some people had were like maybe the controller might not be exactly what you want but that's probably could be swapped out part-wise um some of the buttons and everything um some of the graphics filters were kind of annoying like for example they had some where if you wanted certain scan lines in there they only had it with like the graphics smoothing option which is kind of irritating instead of like the pixel perfect option um so you may just some of those issues might be a thing but otherwise it's a pretty good recreation of it i think yeah and just you know i'm gonna have to base my assumption based off of actual arcade one-up machines and what this is trying to emulate i will say number one it has a pretty impressive lineup of games in it you know most of those arcade one-up machines only have five or six games in them which is a problem for some people i'm not so bothered by it i get what they're trying to do with that kind of like limited release but um the neo geo one does sound very robust so there is that and um it's going to be a different you know kind of screen on it from what you remember in the arcades back in the day um but i actually think that makes it more manageable but i think the way you kind of phrased it where it's the next best thing i think is probably going to be appropriate is like it's probably going to be enough for you to kind of invoke those memories of playing it at an arcade you wouldn't want to deal with the quarter stuff and all that stuff well i shouldn't say that i'm not to say who what type of collector people are and so forth but let me rephrase that quarter stuff and token slot and all that that might be more hassle than you think especially if you just want to get in there and play the games so you know what there might actually be an upside to some of this but i i'd be curious to hear your thoughts once you get it all sorted out and this comes in and by the way before anybody says anything about spending a stimulus check on an arcade machine um people can spend the money however they like and there's plenty of people that are spending the stimulus check on vacations and things of that sort so how is this any different um and you know what i it's one of those things where it's like i also totally recognize that like 2020 has been hard on people's mental health across the board so like if this is something that a person can buy to make themselves happy for a day again who am i to judge i ain't so i just wanted to get that out there because i could see how some folks might be kind of asking some questions there and just remember it's not your place to ask that question all right anyway the rest of the email thanks for taking the time to read and answer this email this email is brought to you by the front door of the white house which hopefully will hit drum part on the ass on his way out na na na na na na na hey hey goodbye dances the cabbage patch you can tell this was written shortly after that um election on tuesday yes mr smoosh i'm reading emails did you want to read the next email he's off camera unfortunately but he's sitting here uh giving his opinion all right uh black kompat in chat says retail therapy has been saving grace for me this year same like you know did i need an xbox series x probably not am i happy i bought one yeah so there you go all right uh let's get to one more email which is from yyr and again this is a dated email because of last week's issues hello lr i wanted to weigh in oh by the way before i get into this too far yyr did i saw this on discord i'm sorry i didn't see the stream but he did some type of charity stream today where he was supposed to play max 300 41 times in a row to celebrate or was it 40 or 41 to celebrate turning his age so i i thought that was impressive dude because i i don't even think i've ever been one time yeah um even a nine-footer that's pretty hard that i probably could still do like let's say orion seven eight siv mix right i still like i still remember how those notes go in my head um but and and for some of you probably have no idea what we're talking about this is a ddr thing okay um but uh the fact that he could do that 41 times that in itself is impressive i i hope it went i hope the stream went very well i'm sorry i missed it um sunday's a very busy day oh sj100 matt says yyr's birthday is today well happy birthday all right well let's finish the birthday boy's email okay uh i wanted to weigh in on the playstation 5 backwards compatibility issue we were talking about on last week's show again we might be dealing with some dated things because we've had some answered questions since then but let's move on we have a list a short one but a list nonetheless of seemingly random games that we're told won't run on playstation 5 at all we have a disclaimer on every playstation 4 game in the playstation store warning us that there may be issues running it on playstation 5 and now we have ubisoft mentioning then unmentioning issues with some of their ps4 games on ps5 personally for me this adds up to a bad omen i get the sense that the playstation 5's backwards compatibility is going to come with asterisks and kavats and that we're not going to get the full sense of what all these are until the consoles are already in our hands i get the distinct impression that sony did not fully plan for this as microsoft certainly appears to have done and that if someone is looking specifically to play playstation 4 games they should probably buy a playstation 4 rather than bank on the theory that playstation 5 would play them perfectly all of that said i hope to be proven wrong so now we have some answers was yyr wrong i would say not completely because he did say there play them perfectly and we have news it's not perfect but it's playable right so and i think those are some of the nuances that might have caused some of that confusion uh that we got again when when ubisoft to put out that announcement there so there's that's kind of my take on it now that the consoles are out in people's hands is that it's not perfect and if you want to play perfect if you want to play the game it was absolutely meant to be designed for especially if they didn't do an updated release like no man's sky or something you want to play it on a playstation 4 and this is you know this is emulation versus the real thing right and there's always going to be people with their strong opinions one way or the other so and fifth dream says that it wants to say that is also on a vast minority of games most games play way better on playstation 5 and especially when you're talking about first party games i'm sure because you know they went in and and made those better or made sure they would work and they would work better anyway to conclude birthday boys email uh thanks again for the show oh and by the way i wasn't kidding when i said to expect a pixel poops announcement soon so please look forward to that have a great week erin or yyr well i'm not what it's been a week where's my announcement all right now i'm excited to see whatever he has in store that's awesome all right that's it for our emails um again looking at chat to see if there's any questions i don't see any questions a lot of people impressed on the max 300 thing in chat for what it's worth uh loki do we have any last minute stories tonight um yeah there was one quick thing so apparently some fans have ported over driver 2 to pc which is interesting because it was originally a playstation exclusive um so now they have this open source uh they basic basically pulled a mario 64 on it they reverse engineered the original code and then made an actual proper port of it and they're releasing it just in time for the 20th anniversary so it's called redriver 2 project and it's uh available on github github.com open driver 2 redriver 2 it's free by the way which i'm sure is going to get them in trouble so get it while you can all right so um and also i got a text before the show from shane and maybe some of you in chat have more of a grip of what's going on the situation um but apparently uh capcom has had some information leak out um what was what the tech say a ton of capcom leaks just happened it looks like by the way and that did trigger my memory about that last week we had a story i don't remember if we got to it or not it might have been cut because of the internet issue but there was a story about that customer data from capcom had leaked or or yeah apparently uh this is something different so it says uh apparently a group a hacker group has stolen a one terabyte worth of stuff uh but only have leaked 60 gigabytes of it and includes the devil may cry 2 source code umbrella chronicles source code resident evil 4 vr ace attorney collection for playstation 4 and switch is this the same group that did this to nintendo i don't know that's my that's my curiosity yeah and that's what fifth dream is asking as well is uh are all these leaks coming from the same leakers uh i'd be very curious about that because if i was another gaming company right now i would be putting the the the law i mean i'm sure these i mean nintendo you would think would be secure as it is in capcom so i don't know how they're getting in if they're doing social engineering or what they're doing to get into this stuff but if i was a gaming company i would be looking at my security policies real good right now because this is uh you know and this again puts us in this weird ethical gray area where i don't think it's necessarily right to be spreading all of this stuff that is hacked but it's all over social media it can't be avoided it is what gamers are talking about so i just hope video game companies are are trying to take the steps they needs that they don't suffer the same fate this is really rough i don't know what else to say um fifth dream says what i understand some of these leaks happened years ago they're just dribbling them out uh bob coffee says nintendo's if i recall correctly was leaked via a chinese company that did the iq devices not nintendo proper well it's still you know what anytime you have vendor agreements or whatever it is you got to make sure that stuff is on lockdown it's it's any game company if you know what i don't know how many people we have out there still listening that work in the game industry but i would be so curious if your company and i realize y'all can't really tell me but you know you can tell me on the down low if you want um i would be so curious if your company doesn't blast some sort of security information this week or if if it hasn't already in the last couple weeks some sort of training everybody has to take on security or changed measures or whatever just to make sure that this doesn't happen to the next company because that's two big ones now and that's uh that's an oof for sure so all right anything else we should talk about loki or is that it i think that's it i'm sure we'll hire more about that next week yeah the capcom thing i it's it's we it's it's such an ethical gray area but i if it catches wind and it's all over social media i feel like you know we have to talk about it because that's the type of thing that people would be talking about at the dinner table um but yeah it's just i think we have to take the approach of how do we prevent this from happening again if it hasn't already uh from the comments of you know this could have happened to a ton of sites already all right uh let's get to some final thoughts and wrap it up for the night um thank you guys for tuning in uh to another episode of orange launch radio and being here especially uh at the launch of another console generation and especially after last week's show did not go as intended um so i'm glad tonight went a lot more smooth thank you thank you um so thank you guys for tuning in and supporting us whether you were here live on sunday night um or whether you caught us on the podcast feed a little later on really appreciate your support uh in that regard so um if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice but we need more voices here to tell us bad jokes like no one special does uh and uh what your auto hosts on um uh i almost said itunes your auto hosts on twitch go a real long way your reviews on itunes are great but your auto hosts on twitch for vog network go a real long way super appreciate those of you that do it i think bobby told me two weeks ago or last week that we had like 40 people that were doing it so that is great i really want to thank everybody who goes out of their way to host the feed here so thank you so much um that's a really great way to get the word out um otherwise that's that's really all i got um have fun gaming be nice to each other enjoy your systems and stop trying to exploit your new systems for clicks uh just play games that's what they're for let's get official final thoughts um loki i'll go to you final thought i'm just gonna be working more on my game you think you'll finish by the end of the year yeah i'm hopeful that i can there's been a few things that have should have been easy that aren't easy so i'm just working on getting through that and then my goal is to get once i have all of the gameplay loop done that's just all creating levels and that'll make it much easier level content is much easier than having to develop the game systems um quick request from chat and i apologize to the podcast listeners because this isn't going to be great but she hulk 10 says let's see loki's shirt we can see the part that says xbox but we can't really see what's underneath it there's some iconography underneath it so yeah so there's different xbox properties in here so i saw this at target the other day so they've got it's uh the years war logo there's a minecraft creeper master chief um helmet there's a steering wheel which i'm assuming is forza orie and a treasure chest which i'm sure has to do with their sea of thieves game so it was just some like it was a it was on sale at target so i just picked it up that and i also have one for a um uh maru chan ramen shirt so i got that as well love it all right uh i don't really have a lot of extra final thoughts i think i just kind of got it out there like um have fun enjoy games uh i know this is a really crappy time with covid putting people back indoors and the holidays are going to be different from what you're used to but games are a way that we can come together a little bit so um on a on a super cheesy note i'm glad you all come together with us every sunday night and um spend time talking about games with us i mean that it's not just a cheesy statement i really do so i think on that note we'll go ahead and roll the credits for real thanks everybody have a great week and we'll see you in seven days to talk about more games good night you've been listening to orange lounge
