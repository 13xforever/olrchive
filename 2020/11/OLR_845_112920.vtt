00:00.000 --> 00:14.520
This week, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has nice things to say about Sony's design and ingenuity,

00:14.520 --> 00:17.800
a nod to the Wii, and doesn't mince words on toxicity and tribalism.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.880
There's being competitive, and then there's being abrasive.

00:20.880 --> 00:24.520
Every console, game, remaster, re-release, online service is just a matter of choices

00:24.520 --> 00:27.840
by the creators, and those choices don't necessarily make sense to anyone else not

00:27.840 --> 00:29.040
part of the process.

00:29.080 --> 00:32.880
Joining Phil's words come the words of your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki,

00:32.880 --> 00:35.880
about this and the rest of the week's news, starting right now in the show, where every

00:35.880 --> 00:36.880
gamer has a voice.

00:40.880 --> 00:46.240
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

00:46.240 --> 00:53.240
every gamer has a voice, another episode of Orange Lounge Radio starting right now here

00:53.240 --> 00:58.200
live at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network where we do tape live every

00:58.360 --> 01:02.040
Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf

01:02.040 --> 01:03.040
show.

01:03.040 --> 01:08.320
It is episode number 845 for this November the 29th of 2020.

01:08.320 --> 01:09.840
My name is Rob Roberts.

01:09.840 --> 01:13.320
Not joining me tonight sadly is Dark Sakura or Jamie Sommers.

01:13.320 --> 01:18.160
She is off for tonight because it is her husband Dan's birthday, and they are doing birthday

01:18.160 --> 01:23.440
things, you know, things that you can do in quarantine outside with friends and stuff,

01:23.440 --> 01:28.040
but taking the night off to be with her hubby on his birthday, and hope they're enjoying

01:28.040 --> 01:29.040
the night.

01:29.040 --> 01:34.400
But joining me live, as he does pretty much every week, say hello to tech master Loki.

01:34.400 --> 01:35.400
Hello.

01:35.400 --> 01:36.400
Hi, Loki.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.400
How are you?

01:37.400 --> 01:38.400
I'm doing fine.

01:38.400 --> 01:39.400
Did you have a good Thanksgiving?

01:39.400 --> 01:40.400
Yeah, it was busy.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.400
I cooked dinner.

01:41.400 --> 01:42.400
So that took like six hours.

01:42.400 --> 01:43.400
Turkey.

01:43.400 --> 01:53.880
So yeah, it was like turkey mashed potatoes stuffing, glazed carrots, creamy casserole

01:53.880 --> 01:56.880
and giblet gravy.

01:56.880 --> 01:57.880
Oh, wow.

01:58.720 --> 01:59.720
Wow.

01:59.720 --> 02:00.720
So yeah.

02:00.720 --> 02:01.720
I never cooked for turkey before.

02:01.720 --> 02:02.720
So that was fun.

02:02.720 --> 02:06.760
And Thanksgiving was different for a lot of people this year, I think, because of everything

02:06.760 --> 02:07.760
going on.

02:07.760 --> 02:12.000
Was it just you, your immediate household, or did you go over to like Nellie's?

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Oh, okay.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
I thought maybe you would have spent time with the wife's mom.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.240
I mean, I did go over to her parents house to drop off some food after we're done, but

02:20.240 --> 02:23.360
yeah, the drop off thing is big too.

02:23.360 --> 02:27.480
I think a lot of like, I know some families were doing like Thanksgiving to go and things

02:27.480 --> 02:28.480
like that.

02:28.480 --> 02:31.960
So obviously, we had a very scaled down year.

02:31.960 --> 02:35.560
We usually don't do anything, especially ever since my mom passed away, which about three

02:35.560 --> 02:41.320
years ago, Thanksgiving has been pretty low key, but it was just myself, Alan and my dad.

02:41.320 --> 02:43.880
And we knew we'd have to mix with my dad.

02:43.880 --> 02:48.000
And that's why, you know, in the weeks leading up to it, I was very careful not to go out

02:48.000 --> 02:49.440
and do anything irresponsible.

02:49.440 --> 02:54.700
And ironically, I ended up having another COVID test on Monday, because I woke up Monday

02:54.700 --> 02:57.860
and I was like, I'm playing the new 2020 game.

02:57.860 --> 02:58.980
Is it allergies?

02:58.980 --> 02:59.980
Is it COVID?

02:59.980 --> 03:00.980
I don't know.

03:00.980 --> 03:05.660
So it turns out it was allergies, at least according to the test.

03:05.660 --> 03:07.660
So that made me feel a lot better actually.

03:07.660 --> 03:12.660
And we did the outdoor dining thing, but it felt comfortable.

03:12.660 --> 03:17.260
Like I know that's a little bit nervous because in some places it can still be pretty packed

03:17.260 --> 03:18.260
together.

03:18.260 --> 03:21.540
But the nice thing is a lot of restaurants out here in suburbia, at least the outdoor

03:21.540 --> 03:25.140
dining is really space because they took over half the parking lot because all the

03:25.140 --> 03:26.660
other places are closed.

03:26.660 --> 03:30.180
So half the parking lot is their tables and they're like super spaced out and it was really

03:30.180 --> 03:31.180
nice.

03:31.180 --> 03:35.440
So that was nice.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.880
So it was just us, small Thanksgiving, but I'm totally okay with that.

03:38.880 --> 03:41.980
So I hope all of you out there had a great Thanksgiving as well.

03:41.980 --> 03:45.880
And, you know, despite the fact it was probably a little different this year, if you did go

03:45.880 --> 03:49.900
to a big family thing because you couldn't get out of it, I understand how the family,

03:49.900 --> 03:52.620
I know I kind of went on a rant at the end of last night's show, but that was for people

03:52.620 --> 03:54.260
who were flaunting it.

03:54.260 --> 03:57.860
I understand some people have no choice and they may have had to go to the big family

03:57.860 --> 04:01.700
thing against their will because family pressure kind of stinks sometimes.

04:01.700 --> 04:02.700
Totally get that.

04:02.700 --> 04:08.060
And, you know, hope you're able to spend some time alone in quarantine over the next week

04:08.060 --> 04:09.380
and a half.

04:09.380 --> 04:12.540
Plenty of video games available to help you pass the time.

04:12.540 --> 04:17.340
Plenty of fine podcasts and broadcasting just like ours out there to help you pass the time

04:17.340 --> 04:18.740
as well.

04:18.740 --> 04:25.060
At least the nice thing is about the world situation in the year 2020, as opposed to

04:25.060 --> 04:29.780
the year 1920 or really more like 1918.

04:29.780 --> 04:33.860
There's much more to do online and things you can do in your house, right?

04:33.860 --> 04:35.700
So yeah, it's nice.

04:35.700 --> 04:39.900
Have you been able to, I'll get into our gaming week soon, but you know, since it is a long

04:39.900 --> 04:44.820
weekend and I imagine you didn't work Thursday, Friday, like a lot of people with the typical

04:44.820 --> 04:49.020
nine to fives, which by the way, thoughts are with all of our friends in the retail

04:49.020 --> 04:52.460
sector who did not get the days off back to back.

04:52.460 --> 04:57.500
Hope you, I heard it was like, I didn't see the fistfight videos and all that stuff.

04:57.500 --> 05:02.380
Unfortunately there was a shooting at the mall here, but that seems completely isolated

05:02.380 --> 05:04.460
from the fact that it was Black Friday.

05:04.460 --> 05:07.620
I hope everybody out there in the retail world, I hope y'all made it through okay.

05:07.620 --> 05:11.460
Cause I'm sure it wasn't easy this year, but I know a lot of folks, office jobs had the

05:11.460 --> 05:13.200
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday off.

05:13.200 --> 05:17.560
And I was thinking, wow, Loki, that might be a lot of time for you to work on your game.

05:17.560 --> 05:19.800
Was it a good, was it a good crunch time for your game?

05:19.800 --> 05:23.040
Yeah, it was, it was, it was fun.

05:23.040 --> 05:24.680
So I got a lot done.

05:24.680 --> 05:28.960
A lot of the code stuff I needed to get done is now done now.

05:28.960 --> 05:38.360
So I've been lately working on just art and music stuff to go in to, I just padding up

05:38.360 --> 05:39.360
what I had already.

05:39.360 --> 05:48.600
Cause I have like art and music and sound effects already, but it's just, I needed more.

05:48.600 --> 05:49.600
Interesting.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.080
Do you think you might, when do you think you're going to be ready to unveil this?

05:52.080 --> 05:53.800
Do you think it might be ready next week?

05:53.800 --> 05:56.440
Cause you don't know about this, but I'm about to announce something a little later in the

05:56.440 --> 05:57.440
show for next week.

05:57.440 --> 06:03.080
I mean, I mean, hopefully soon I, I, I know I said I wanted to get it done this year.

06:03.080 --> 06:06.680
So I'm like, I'm really like every day.

06:06.680 --> 06:14.960
So like I, I, I, I, I, I'm hoping very soon, but like, like I don't want to, I don't want

06:14.960 --> 06:19.080
to put out a yellow text or yellow background tweet or anything.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.480
So, you know, I get it.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.480
No, it's admirable.

06:21.480 --> 06:22.480
It's admirable.

06:22.480 --> 06:26.160
And no, that's good because you know, with time to car, you were kind of showing a little

06:26.160 --> 06:31.000
bit of the detail and then you were like, eh, he kind of got rid of it.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.400
So that was a whole different thing.

06:32.400 --> 06:35.960
So that, yeah, that one, it was, it was work working on it.

06:35.960 --> 06:41.400
And then, um, it just like, I, I kind of went the wrong way with that.

06:41.400 --> 06:46.800
Like I did all the art stuff and kind of got bad, but then it wasn't fun.

06:46.800 --> 06:49.840
So that was the problem was like, why am I working on this?

06:49.840 --> 06:56.520
If it's not really that fun to play and then it just kind of like lost the, the, the idea

06:56.520 --> 06:57.520
for it.

06:57.520 --> 07:00.520
And then, you know, now, uh, you know, what the golf came out and that's basically the

07:00.520 --> 07:03.200
game anyways, you know, the driving stuff is kind of like that.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.560
So all right, I'll need to make that.

07:05.560 --> 07:08.920
Well, I'm excited to see whatever it is you have in store whenever you're ready.

07:08.920 --> 07:14.040
I do think it's admirable that you are waiting until like your releases penny.

07:14.040 --> 07:16.720
I think sometimes in the games industry, we wish it was this way.

07:16.720 --> 07:19.920
Like don't show it off until you're ready to go.

07:19.920 --> 07:22.920
We understand there's gotta be hype, there's gonna be pre-orders and things like that,

07:22.920 --> 07:27.560
but you know what, at least when you announced just before you release, it's like, you know,

07:27.560 --> 07:28.560
it's coming, you know, it's done.

07:28.560 --> 07:29.560
There you go.

07:29.600 --> 07:35.120
At least just like, yeah, just to where I know that, like, I have a momentum to where

07:35.120 --> 07:36.520
I should be able to get it done.

07:36.520 --> 07:41.440
The good news though, like as I've been posting, like kind of big updates online is that like

07:41.440 --> 07:46.380
code wise, like I've hit my minimal viable already.

07:46.380 --> 07:50.800
So like I have a full game loop with like, you know, I can start the game, I can lose

07:50.800 --> 07:54.920
the game, I can win the game, you know, everything works as far as that goes.

07:54.920 --> 07:59.360
And I got the core, like gameplay elements I wanted in there.

07:59.360 --> 08:02.040
And then now it's just all the additional stuff.

08:02.040 --> 08:05.240
Whereas before it's like, I'm going to add all this stuff in there and then I can't finish

08:05.240 --> 08:06.400
everything.

08:06.400 --> 08:11.880
So like time to car kind of helped you learn, even though literally everybody in chat was

08:11.880 --> 08:15.480
telling you, don't do something like that for your first game.

08:15.480 --> 08:20.720
At least you still had that experience of, I learned some things about what I did like

08:20.720 --> 08:23.720
about the process, what I didn't like that you've been able to apply here.

08:23.720 --> 08:27.600
And it sounds to me like, well, you, you have a, you have a done game at this point.

08:27.600 --> 08:31.640
You have something you could release, but it's not up to the level you want it to be

08:31.640 --> 08:32.640
at.

08:32.640 --> 08:33.640
Am I right?

08:33.640 --> 08:34.640
Yeah.

08:34.640 --> 08:35.640
Yeah.

08:35.640 --> 08:40.440
I mean, it's, it's definitely not able to be released yet, but you can play it.

08:40.440 --> 08:47.480
And I'd like to say that I learned my lesson with the last game, but I didn't.

08:47.480 --> 08:52.480
So like I didn't necessarily follow the best advice for that stuff, but yeah, you'll see

08:52.480 --> 08:53.480
it.

08:53.480 --> 08:54.480
It'll turn out great.

08:54.480 --> 08:55.480
I'm sure.

08:55.480 --> 08:56.480
All right.

08:56.480 --> 08:59.080
I go into our chat because again, we do tape live on Sunday nights over at VOG network,

08:59.080 --> 09:03.160
twitch.tv slash VOG network and Akuma JP is in chat.

09:03.160 --> 09:08.400
Always love to see him saying, so is it really coming or is it cyberpunk coming out?

09:08.400 --> 09:12.440
Uh, that's the, uh, the problem there.

09:12.440 --> 09:14.560
Cause cyberpunk is coming out in a couple of weeks here.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.840
So it's like, which will be here first.

09:16.840 --> 09:17.840
That's the question.

09:17.840 --> 09:18.840
Okay.

09:18.840 --> 09:23.920
But like, that's going to be a huge distraction, but, um, yeah, we'll see.

09:23.920 --> 09:24.920
We'll push through it.

09:24.920 --> 09:25.920
All right.

09:25.920 --> 09:26.920
Sounds good.

09:26.920 --> 09:31.600
Uh, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic here, uh, and talk about, um, some comments

09:31.600 --> 09:35.880
made by Phil Spencer, who someone I, you know, I've, I've talked pretty favorably of him

09:35.880 --> 09:42.480
on the show previously, but he really is becoming a voice I like to hear from, you know, I gotta

09:42.480 --> 09:43.480
be honest.

09:43.480 --> 09:47.360
There's some people in gaming where I find, I don't like to hear from them as much.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.760
Uh, and I, I, I'm not going to live in a negative place.

09:49.760 --> 09:54.000
I'm not going to tell you who, but you can guess, um, but this is one of those people

09:54.000 --> 09:58.880
I like to hear from because the more he kind of gives his insight on the gaming industry,

09:58.880 --> 09:59.880
the more I like it.

09:59.880 --> 10:03.400
I was just commenting to Bobby at the end of his show, you know, the gaming industry

10:03.400 --> 10:06.800
has been kind of missing somebody like Reggie Fils-Aime, right?

10:06.800 --> 10:08.400
Everybody loved Reggie Fils-Aime.

10:08.400 --> 10:12.400
Even if you weren't always the biggest Nintendo person, like, like Loki, like kind of loves

10:12.400 --> 10:14.640
Nintendo some days and doesn't love them other days.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.760
And quite frankly, I feel the same way.

10:16.760 --> 10:20.080
But Reggie Fils-Aime was always like, he's just awesome.

10:20.080 --> 10:23.680
He's something like, like when you think of like a guy you want in the boardroom representing

10:23.680 --> 10:26.040
the game, Reggie Fils-Aime is a great guy, right?

10:26.040 --> 10:30.120
And that's why a lot of people have been trying to go after him ever since he retired from

10:30.120 --> 10:32.560
Nintendo right now while he's on GameStop boards.

10:32.560 --> 10:37.400
But the, the industry doesn't have like a big, big voice like that, right?

10:37.400 --> 10:41.840
But I find that Phil Spencer's kind of becoming that guy where I'm like, I kind of think if

10:41.840 --> 10:45.940
anybody should be the flag bearer, maybe, maybe this guy, I don't know.

10:45.980 --> 10:49.780
But of course, there can always be several people that you can look up to and admire.

10:49.780 --> 10:55.100
But Phil Spencer's definitely somebody where I'm like, I am so happy he's running Xbox

10:55.100 --> 10:59.420
as opposed to before, we'll just say that, before.

10:59.420 --> 11:00.720
Right, yeah, I get it.

11:00.720 --> 11:07.340
And so like, this is kind of coming from an interview he did with The Verge, kind of talking

11:07.340 --> 11:13.580
about just the game industry and stuff and talking about some of this negativity that's

11:13.620 --> 11:16.700
in the industry, just as a whole, or even like fans of it.

11:16.700 --> 11:18.820
You see it all the time when you go online.

11:18.820 --> 11:24.780
I mean, even like so many articles have come out, like comparing stuff, basically, you

11:24.780 --> 11:30.900
know, the, the essence of it is, you know, wanting something, wanting the opposition

11:30.900 --> 11:37.220
thing to fail so that the thing that you bought succeeds, you know, that, you know, you want

11:37.220 --> 11:42.300
it to look like I bought an Xbox, so I want the PlayStation 5 to fail, you know, it, which

11:42.300 --> 11:43.300
is ridiculous.

11:43.300 --> 11:44.540
It's, it's kind of silly.

11:44.540 --> 11:50.340
I mean, especially if you're a person that purchased this, you know, your consumer and

11:50.340 --> 11:54.580
not necessarily the companies buying it, it's even makes less sense for you to be concerned

11:54.580 --> 12:00.220
about whether one company succeeds or fails, unless that company is EA, in which case I

12:00.220 --> 12:05.140
would be hoping that the loot box stuff will fail, but that'll never, ever happen.

12:05.140 --> 12:10.740
But like, it is, it's silly basically saying, you know, I, you know, he really wants to

12:10.740 --> 12:14.780
kind of embrace this, you know, wanting everybody to succeed.

12:14.780 --> 12:20.180
And that's why you see a lot of times online, you know, every PlayStation, Xbox congratulating

12:20.180 --> 12:21.180
each other.

12:21.180 --> 12:26.580
And I don't even think necessarily you hear too much about them dogging on the other systems

12:26.580 --> 12:27.580
and stuff.

12:27.580 --> 12:31.380
I think they're just really focused on what their systems can do and kind of pushing that

12:31.380 --> 12:32.380
up.

12:32.380 --> 12:36.780
It's more of the fanboys that are kind of, you know, dogging on everybody.

12:36.820 --> 12:43.340
It's these type of people that like do this for everything, whether it's consoles, it's

12:43.340 --> 12:49.180
politics, it's sports teams, it's anything, it's just, you know.

12:49.180 --> 12:53.660
I was going to make the comparison too, that this does happen in another industry sometimes.

12:53.660 --> 12:57.580
How about the gays and pop divas?

12:57.580 --> 13:01.740
And I know you see it too, Loki, you've got to see this, you know enough gay guys, and

13:01.740 --> 13:07.140
I can speak as one, that you see this on social media where it's like, you know, oh,

13:07.140 --> 13:11.580
Katy Perry, she's basic, screw her, you know, hope she's a flop.

13:11.580 --> 13:16.220
Christina Aguilera, bionic, flop Tina, you know, like all this stuff, right?

13:16.220 --> 13:19.860
And it's like, shouldn't we be lifting up all women?

13:19.860 --> 13:23.620
Like shouldn't we be, you know, why does it have to be a competition?

13:23.620 --> 13:25.700
Can't we be happy for all of the great...

13:25.700 --> 13:31.380
I think people in, I don't know necessarily the psychology behind it, but I feel that

13:31.420 --> 13:37.220
it's probably something to do with people want to feel like that they're winning sometimes.

13:37.220 --> 13:40.860
And they do that maybe even vicariously through other things.

13:40.860 --> 13:46.180
So whether it be sports teams, whether it be politics, whether it be, you know, even

13:46.180 --> 13:50.900
game consoles or whatever, you know, back in the day when we were growing up, it was

13:50.900 --> 13:55.220
Nintendo and Sega and it's like, oh, they suck and they suck.

13:55.220 --> 13:58.180
There's another great comparison because I was going to ask if maybe some of this is

13:58.180 --> 14:02.780
rooted in where gaming culture has come from.

14:02.780 --> 14:05.740
I mean, you know, I don't have the magazines in front of me.

14:05.740 --> 14:06.740
I wish I did.

14:06.740 --> 14:10.420
But, you know, maybe that's a trip down memory lane we need to take at some point.

14:10.420 --> 14:14.460
But like if I had some old gaming magazines, I could open them up and show you that there

14:14.460 --> 14:18.900
would be these ads, giant, full page, sometimes multi-page ads that would be things like Sega

14:18.900 --> 14:25.740
does what Nintendon't or you see an ad for like the Neo Geo that compares.

14:25.740 --> 14:26.740
I think it was.

14:26.740 --> 14:27.740
I'm sorry, guys.

14:28.300 --> 14:32.020
I don't literally remember what ads they were, but there were some that would like show the

14:32.020 --> 14:37.740
Nintendo fans as a baby and the Sega fans as, you know, somebody who, you know, doesn't

14:37.740 --> 14:40.340
look very intelligent and so on.

14:40.340 --> 14:45.420
And then it's like, but the TurboGrafx 16 or the Neo Geo has power, you know, and all

14:45.420 --> 14:46.420
this stuff.

14:46.420 --> 14:49.780
It's better for the price I'm paying for that stuff.

14:49.780 --> 14:56.400
So yeah, this was a part of our culture that we would read a lot about in the old magazines

14:56.440 --> 15:01.360
that now I think because it's manifested itself into something really gross that we've seen

15:01.360 --> 15:05.200
happen on social media, you know, over the years is it's it.

15:05.200 --> 15:09.480
That's why I love that Phil Spencer's kind of starting to put his foot down and say enough.

15:09.480 --> 15:11.580
It doesn't have to be like that.

15:11.580 --> 15:14.600
We can all be successful and root for each other.

15:14.600 --> 15:15.600
Yeah.

15:15.600 --> 15:21.300
And I don't I really don't get what the point is like people like dogging other people for

15:21.300 --> 15:23.940
what they like in any aspect.

15:23.940 --> 15:27.100
It doesn't make any sense.

15:27.100 --> 15:32.700
You know, I don't know where they could derive pleasure from that.

15:32.700 --> 15:38.560
I mean, maybe it's just, you know, trolling people because there's people that like trolling

15:38.560 --> 15:41.980
folks for whatever reason.

15:41.980 --> 15:42.980
I don't know.

15:42.980 --> 15:47.900
But it is something that, you know, has gone on for a long time.

15:47.900 --> 15:50.060
I don't think it's going away anytime soon.

15:50.060 --> 15:55.980
But it is nice to see that at least the game companies are starting to take the stance

15:55.980 --> 16:00.660
of like, maybe we shouldn't get down in the mud with all of those people.

16:00.660 --> 16:04.140
Maybe we should just take the high road here and just do that.

16:04.140 --> 16:06.100
Not to say that everybody has done that.

16:06.100 --> 16:12.060
I mean, just a few years ago when Sony was doing this silly video about sharing games,

16:12.060 --> 16:13.060
which is fine.

16:13.060 --> 16:14.740
You know, that's a legit dig, I guess.

16:14.740 --> 16:17.380
I saw that more as shade.

16:17.380 --> 16:22.460
So now let me steal something else from my gaze, all right?

16:22.460 --> 16:26.240
So that video felt more like shade to me.

16:26.240 --> 16:29.600
And there's this old quote from RuPaul, and whether you love her or hate her, she's got

16:29.600 --> 16:30.980
some catchy quotes.

16:30.980 --> 16:36.980
And there's this great quote from RuPaul where it is, throwing shade takes creativity, being

16:36.980 --> 16:38.500
a bitch takes none.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.080
And that's the quote.

16:40.080 --> 16:46.180
And I think when you look at those Sony commercials, they were shady, and they were creative, and

16:46.180 --> 16:51.020
they were making a point based off of what a lot of people in the industry were really

16:51.020 --> 16:55.980
frustrated with, which was the direction that the Xbox One was going in at the time with

16:55.980 --> 16:59.660
the TV, TV, sports, sports, always online, no training, you know, and all the stuff that

16:59.660 --> 17:02.540
people didn't like about the Xbox One.

17:02.540 --> 17:07.500
But being a bitch is what I see in the comment section whenever Microsoft makes a tweet or

17:07.500 --> 17:08.940
Sony makes a tweet.

17:08.940 --> 17:12.260
And you've all seen it, because you all know not to read the comment section.

17:12.260 --> 17:15.620
I just see a bunch of uncreative bitches.

17:15.620 --> 17:16.620
That's what I see.

17:16.620 --> 17:17.620
Yeah.

17:17.620 --> 17:19.740
And it's people complaining about stuff that's ridiculous.

17:19.740 --> 17:25.300
Like you're looking at game specs and like, well, this one, you know, the frame rates,

17:25.300 --> 17:31.420
you know, it's not 120 frames per second in this game, and this one, the wall doesn't

17:31.420 --> 17:36.340
have the fun adaptive triggers, because Sony's got that on their DualSense, so therefore

17:36.340 --> 17:38.660
the Xbox controllers suck.

17:38.660 --> 17:44.580
It's like, it's just stupid petty arguments, like, what are you, I don't know what you're

17:44.580 --> 17:46.300
trying to do like that.

17:46.300 --> 17:50.460
That's a debate you can have if you're deciding like, hey, I don't know which console to get

17:50.460 --> 17:54.120
and you're asking your friends, you know what they recommend or what you think, you know,

17:54.120 --> 17:56.340
you have your advantages and your disadvantages.

17:56.340 --> 18:00.100
And if it ends up being some popular thing, like say those adaptive triggers are super

18:00.100 --> 18:05.460
popular, then guess what the next console that comes out is going to have those things

18:05.460 --> 18:09.420
because it's the same thing with like the rumble, you know, the HD rumble thing that

18:09.420 --> 18:12.580
was a popular thing that was in the Joy-Con.

18:12.580 --> 18:13.580
So what did Sony do?

18:13.580 --> 18:14.580
They did the same thing.

18:14.580 --> 18:17.500
I mean, they've done it before with like motion controls.

18:17.500 --> 18:23.660
They like to copy Nintendo, but it's just, it's a neat innovative thing, but let's just

18:23.660 --> 18:24.820
see how it's being used.

18:24.820 --> 18:28.780
I mean, there was a thing that they were touting before, which I still have it, like I said,

18:28.780 --> 18:33.660
I'm pretty new to the Xbox One stuff, but they were touting, you know, the rumble that

18:33.660 --> 18:37.700
was in the triggers before it was supposed to be like some immersive thing.

18:37.700 --> 18:41.500
I haven't noticed anything yet, but then again, I haven't played any games like that.

18:41.740 --> 18:42.740
They have that.

18:42.740 --> 18:45.220
So I don't know if that's just all hype.

18:45.220 --> 18:49.340
I mean, same with the motion controls they were talking about before with the, you know,

18:49.340 --> 18:51.380
the six axis, that was supposed to be a big thing.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.820
We don't really see a lot of it.

18:52.820 --> 18:56.460
And sometimes, Loki, it's all a marketing thing too, not so much in the case you're

18:56.460 --> 19:01.380
talking about, but my brain went to when Sega had blast processing.

19:01.380 --> 19:06.940
Remember when that, that was fucking made the fuck up, like that was a marketing thing.

19:06.940 --> 19:10.660
And so it's, it's, it's, it's, it's like talking about, what is it?

19:10.660 --> 19:11.660
Terra flops.

19:11.660 --> 19:13.900
Oh, this console has more teraflop.

19:13.900 --> 19:17.280
Do you even like, and this is what I want to ask these people on Twitter.

19:17.280 --> 19:20.700
Do you even know what a teraflop is?

19:20.700 --> 19:21.700
You teraflop?

19:21.700 --> 19:28.300
Well, that's just teraflops or something that like, that's just, it wasn't a literal, it

19:28.300 --> 19:29.300
wasn't a literal question.

19:29.300 --> 19:30.300
No, no, I understand that.

19:30.300 --> 19:36.300
But like, I think that they, it's, it's something that I see when I watch a lot of tech reviewers

19:36.340 --> 19:41.620
and stuff, they use that as a point to kind of compare the power of the system, the potential

19:41.620 --> 19:42.780
power, I guess.

19:42.780 --> 19:47.280
But like, even now, like when they're saying, Oh, like people declaring that, Oh yeah, Sony's

19:47.280 --> 19:48.620
won the race already.

19:48.620 --> 19:51.060
Like literally a week or two after the console is launched.

19:51.060 --> 19:56.580
And we're talking about launch games that, you know, probably don't know how to utilize

19:56.580 --> 19:58.440
the hardware the best anyways.

19:58.440 --> 19:59.740
And we're already drawing distinctions.

19:59.740 --> 20:03.220
Oh, well, it's over for Microsoft or it's open for Sony.

20:03.220 --> 20:05.600
Like, dude, it is way too early.

20:05.600 --> 20:09.400
We haven't even seen the potential for these games yet.

20:09.400 --> 20:14.740
And you're already trying to, you know, call the, you know, call the results of the race

20:14.740 --> 20:17.160
here, which there really is no race.

20:17.160 --> 20:19.640
It's just something to keep you busy, I guess.

20:19.640 --> 20:20.640
Okay.

20:20.640 --> 20:21.640
You're 2020.

20:21.640 --> 20:22.640
Let me get to some chat comments.

20:22.640 --> 20:24.720
Cause you guys are lighting up in chat and I love it.

20:24.720 --> 20:30.240
At twitch.tv slash vlog network, Phoenix 77 26 describing a teraflop says it's what my

20:30.240 --> 20:33.960
fat butt makes when I cannonball of a high dive.

20:33.960 --> 20:34.960
Same.

20:34.960 --> 20:40.800
My friend, same quest buster says teraflop equals how many pancakes are flipped per process,

20:40.800 --> 20:43.320
but how many bunnies are carrying the pancakes?

20:43.320 --> 20:45.440
That's what I want to tear a bunny.

20:45.440 --> 20:50.460
Bobby Black Wolf says, I mean, really George Plimpton's Intellivision ads were the original

20:50.460 --> 20:55.780
console war Intellivision once again, making history he'd have Intellivision baseball and

20:55.780 --> 20:59.960
Atari 2,600 baseball and say, which one would you rather play?

20:59.960 --> 21:04.720
Or once you compare, you'll know, and I remember those ads too.

21:04.720 --> 21:09.040
So Intellivision is to blame for all this and how ironic that the Amico is now the family

21:09.040 --> 21:10.040
friendly console.

21:10.040 --> 21:11.040
Right.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.040
How ironic.

21:12.040 --> 21:13.040
Anyway.

21:13.040 --> 21:19.060
Um, and black, black and Pat in chat says, why does it have to be over for anyone?

21:19.060 --> 21:20.060
Great question.

21:20.060 --> 21:24.460
And let's talk about the Amico for a second because there's a ton of people out there

21:24.460 --> 21:31.840
already canceling this device because it's not, you know, it's, it's not there to answer

21:31.840 --> 21:38.220
to the PlayStation five or the Xbox series X, but it's existing to its own thing.

21:38.220 --> 21:39.220
It's a risk.

21:39.220 --> 21:40.220
Yeah.

21:40.220 --> 21:42.980
And some people say it as a risk that could go to a good place and some people say it's

21:42.980 --> 21:43.980
a risk.

21:43.980 --> 21:44.980
It go to a bad place.

21:44.980 --> 21:52.620
It's a risk, but can't we hope it is if the Amico is a runaway success and sells millions

21:52.620 --> 21:53.620
of Amico's.

21:53.620 --> 21:55.860
You don't know, you, you don't know until it happens.

21:55.860 --> 21:58.660
Is it, is it going to hurt the industry?

21:58.660 --> 22:02.500
If the Amico is a runaway success, is that a good thing or a bad thing?

22:02.500 --> 22:07.380
Because I would say the Ami you, you should want the Amico to succeed.

22:07.380 --> 22:11.600
You should want all of these gaming devices to succeed because that more competition is

22:11.600 --> 22:13.200
going to create better games.

22:13.200 --> 22:17.320
Those more avenues to have games to play is going to make for better games.

22:17.320 --> 22:21.300
Having a device which, you know, allows more gamers is going to make for a better gaming

22:21.300 --> 22:23.260
culture and so on and so on.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.020
Loki, I'm sorry, you wanted to comment.

22:25.020 --> 22:26.020
No, no, no.

22:26.020 --> 22:28.940
I was going to say like, I was thinking before with the Amico, I don't think it's going to

22:28.940 --> 22:34.900
hurt the industry, but, and it's as much as I love Tommy and the whole team that he's

22:34.900 --> 22:40.540
assembled to put it together and the Amico looks like a nice piece of hardware.

22:40.540 --> 22:44.340
The games are a little sketchy looking right now.

22:44.340 --> 22:48.180
They just, they, they, they come off and I know it's probably underselling it.

22:48.180 --> 22:54.900
They come off just as small, which is, it's, it's a bad connotation cause there's great

22:54.900 --> 22:55.900
mobile games out there.

22:55.900 --> 22:58.940
And that doesn't mean anything about how the games are actually going to play.

22:58.940 --> 23:00.420
Cause let's look at Wii Sports.

23:00.420 --> 23:05.540
That that game was basic as hell, but it's still, it was a great game.

23:05.540 --> 23:10.020
And so you can't really necessarily judge stuff by the games, but the problem it like

23:10.020 --> 23:18.060
it just, a lot of this seems like Ouya and I know it's definitely different than Ouya,

23:18.060 --> 23:21.860
but it's just like that, like getting excited, this is going to be revolutionary.

23:21.860 --> 23:24.620
And they just like flops hard.

23:24.620 --> 23:28.420
That's not to say that just because one did that this one's going to, it's just, that's

23:28.420 --> 23:36.420
the kind of, I see it in that going that way right now, but that's not to say that they

23:36.420 --> 23:38.220
could easily prove me wrong.

23:38.220 --> 23:45.340
And it's just, that's my, my healthy skepticism right now about it is, is I want them to succeed,

23:46.340 --> 23:49.580
It's okay to have the healthy skepticism because we do love this.

23:49.580 --> 23:51.500
And I've talked about this a million times on the show.

23:51.500 --> 23:55.100
I'll say it one more time because you never know who's listening for the first time this

23:55.100 --> 23:56.100
week.

23:56.100 --> 23:59.900
But even when we are critical about things in the industry that we really love, like

23:59.900 --> 24:01.740
Nintendo, right?

24:01.740 --> 24:04.040
We're critical because we are fans.

24:04.040 --> 24:05.540
We want to see them do well.

24:05.540 --> 24:09.580
So when they make these moves that we don't understand, that's what can be frustrating.

24:09.580 --> 24:14.700
But any criticism we make on this show does come from a place of wanting to see them succeed.

24:14.700 --> 24:17.100
And I think a lot of that is true about Amico as well.

24:17.100 --> 24:21.620
And there was a great comment in chat that said, um, uh, as Joe and Hunter Matt says,

24:21.620 --> 24:26.400
thankfully gaming success stories have come in the form of indie games breaking through.

24:26.400 --> 24:29.200
And that truly is all the Amico needs.

24:29.200 --> 24:34.220
If the Amico has that great indie partnership we don't know about yet and gets that breakthrough

24:34.220 --> 24:40.020
indie game, it won't, all that other stuff you're concerned about won't matter.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.340
You know what I mean?

24:41.340 --> 24:42.340
It's great.

24:42.340 --> 24:46.760
Having like these packing games and stuff, they're really trying to capture that whole

24:46.760 --> 24:51.420
Wii sports market, which it's really, there's no market right now.

24:51.420 --> 24:52.420
Let's be honest.

24:52.420 --> 24:58.820
I mean, they sorta kinda, I mean, you didn't really, the Switch was popular, but it's not,

24:58.820 --> 25:01.020
it didn't have that like breakthrough success.

25:01.020 --> 25:07.940
I think like the, the weed is far as in the sense of like catering to non gamers.

25:07.940 --> 25:11.860
Um, I granted, there's probably a lot of people that own the Wii that probably now

25:11.860 --> 25:19.140
have a Switch, but it's not bringing, I think a ton of new, uh, gaming, uh, people that

25:19.140 --> 25:25.060
are going to be into gaming now, um, with this, this isn't, you don't have a Wii sports

25:25.060 --> 25:27.660
per se on the Switch right now.

25:27.660 --> 25:33.460
Um, but I think that this could do well, especially if it's, you know, priced, you know, right.

25:34.460 --> 25:35.740
That'd be interesting to see.

25:35.740 --> 25:38.180
I am curious to see how stuff turns out on there.

25:38.180 --> 25:40.860
Um, let, let me, let me bring up some, let me bring up something else.

25:40.860 --> 25:41.860
Sorry.

25:41.860 --> 25:45.620
Cause I, I didn't, I didn't want to turn this into the Amico hour, but let me take another

25:45.620 --> 25:49.260
gaming device that I've been highly critical of on this program.

25:49.260 --> 25:53.500
And I want to explain why and where I'm actually secretly rooting for it to be successful.

25:53.500 --> 25:58.060
And that would be Google Stadia, I think is a very appropriate thing to address as, um,

25:58.060 --> 25:59.960
I would love if this was a success.

25:59.960 --> 26:02.740
I just don't think it's going to be in its current form.

26:02.740 --> 26:07.240
And a lot of it has to do again, I think a lot of it is, it's just, it's just too soon.

26:07.240 --> 26:11.860
And there's that real concern that Google is going to walk away from it just in time

26:11.860 --> 26:16.120
to see, you know, for, for the, the rest of the industry to finally catch up to where

26:16.120 --> 26:17.840
we need something like Google Stadia.

26:17.840 --> 26:20.640
And a lot of it has to do with these bandwidth caps, right?

26:20.640 --> 26:22.360
You know, there was a story going around this week.

26:22.360 --> 26:25.300
I don't think it made our show roll tonight, so I'll talk about it real quick here.

26:25.300 --> 26:30.760
Um, Google Stadia was showing off that cyberpunk can run in 4k and it looks really good.

26:30.820 --> 26:34.220
But my response to that is, that's great.

26:34.220 --> 26:39.080
But now on the other hand, you just had a story come out that said, guess what, Comcast

26:39.080 --> 26:44.760
is bringing in those 1.2 terabyte caps to the, to the entirety of the Northeast and

26:44.760 --> 26:48.800
every place that didn't have a bandwidth cap before is now going to have one.

26:48.800 --> 26:53.360
And so it's like, that was a really shitty yin to the yang of the other story.

26:53.360 --> 27:00.120
So honestly, Google, if they were really smart, would be putting a lot of pressure on a company

27:00.120 --> 27:07.260
like Comcast to either make, I think a lot of us would really hate to see things go here,

27:07.260 --> 27:12.000
but I think we all know the possibility is it could, to make Stadia bandwidth an exception

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
to the cap.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
I know.

27:14.000 --> 27:19.160
Well, I hate saying it, but it could happen or pressuring to get those caps raised.

27:19.160 --> 27:26.440
So one nice thing about January 20th, um, with the new president coming in is that a

27:26.440 --> 27:30.840
G Pi is buh-bye from, you know, the FCC.

27:30.840 --> 27:32.400
That's true.

27:32.400 --> 27:36.560
So that, that, that brings me all sorts of hope because screw that guy.

27:36.560 --> 27:37.560
Yes.

27:37.560 --> 27:38.560
No, screw that guy.

27:38.560 --> 27:39.560
Don't let the door hit you.

27:39.560 --> 27:41.480
Um, but, uh, yeah, yeah, you're right.

27:41.480 --> 27:44.560
That'll be, that'll be interesting to see what happens with all that.

27:44.560 --> 27:49.400
Um, so, uh, let's see, and what else I want to say about Google Stadia and yeah, putting

27:49.400 --> 27:54.760
the pressure on like, you know, Comcast to hopefully increase or at least kind of negotiate

27:54.760 --> 28:01.440
because you know, Comcast likes to say, Oh, well only 5% of people go over that bandwidth

28:01.440 --> 28:08.660
cap, but when you're Google Stadia and your target is that 5% or that, that group that's

28:08.660 --> 28:12.360
right at that cap, you know, it's, it's rough.

28:12.360 --> 28:17.160
So I just, yeah, I, I, I do think, and I've, I've said this on the show before too.

28:17.160 --> 28:23.280
I do think the thing that will finally light the fire under Comcast, but is going to be

28:23.280 --> 28:28.480
the more wide adoption of 5g and that's coming in the next few years.

28:28.480 --> 28:31.600
But 5g is pretty damn fast, right?

28:31.600 --> 28:35.320
So as 5g becomes available in more and more places, there's going to be people that are

28:35.320 --> 28:39.200
like, you know what, I've got an unlimited plan on my phone.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.800
You know, fuck this Comcast thing.

28:40.800 --> 28:45.480
I'm going to download the games through my tethered phone 5g connection, which I know

28:45.480 --> 28:50.040
sounds ridiculous now, but did you think 10 years ago we'd even have what we have here

28:50.040 --> 28:51.520
with these phones?

28:51.520 --> 28:54.000
And that's going to be what it looks like in the future.

28:54.000 --> 28:59.720
But even with 5g though, even if on those unlimited plans, it's not unlimited 5g, it's

28:59.720 --> 29:05.220
you get so many gigabytes at 5g and then everything is throttled after that.

29:05.220 --> 29:07.280
That's how they work on most of these cell plans.

29:07.280 --> 29:10.320
It's not going to be the full speed for the full unlimited.

29:10.320 --> 29:13.240
They all have caps.

29:13.240 --> 29:18.320
But like really like if that their argument is that, Oh, only 5% of the customers hit

29:18.320 --> 29:19.320
that cap.

29:19.320 --> 29:28.120
I mean, really there's no different, it doesn't cost them any more money to be able to have

29:28.120 --> 29:30.640
no bandwidth caps at all.

29:30.640 --> 29:31.640
It's just,

29:31.640 --> 29:37.540
And they got rid of it for three months in response to the pandemic and just to bring

29:37.540 --> 29:38.900
it back.

29:38.900 --> 29:44.560
They're getting rid of it because they're adding it back in is because they're not making,

29:44.560 --> 29:47.520
they're losing sales in their cable subscriptions.

29:47.520 --> 29:50.840
And that's the problem is they need to make that money up somewhere else.

29:50.840 --> 29:51.880
And that's what they're doing.

29:51.880 --> 29:55.960
And on top of that, they're also raising prices across the board anyways, next year and as

29:55.960 --> 30:01.240
they do every year, even though they don't provide me with any other service or whatever,

30:01.240 --> 30:04.620
they just raise the prices each year.

30:04.620 --> 30:09.240
But that's what you get when you have basically a monopoly in the company or the country,

30:09.240 --> 30:10.720
each of these capable.

30:10.720 --> 30:17.080
And that's why I think 5g is going to finally, I think start to inch its way in on that monopoly

30:17.080 --> 30:20.760
because there will be other ways to get your internet in your house.

30:20.760 --> 30:26.760
And 5g, I mean, hypothetically, you could just have a 5g antenna and wire your house

30:26.760 --> 30:27.760
that way.

30:27.760 --> 30:32.200
Like, I know these things I say sound like ridiculous because we don't know them yet.

30:32.200 --> 30:33.200
But why couldn't they?

30:33.200 --> 30:37.020
Why couldn't you have a company that sells 5g internet?

30:37.020 --> 30:41.880
They have that in midtown Sacramento, but like, and I keep asking them like when Verizon

30:41.880 --> 30:45.520
comes out there, Oh, yeah, who do you have for your internet and I'm like, I've got you

30:45.520 --> 30:46.520
for my mobile.

30:46.960 --> 30:54.520
When are you going to get 5g and part of the team are like, well, I'm like, dude, like,

30:54.520 --> 30:58.400
I would switch if you just brought me the service.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.860
It's just, it's miles down the road.

31:00.860 --> 31:02.240
Can you please just bring it to me?

31:02.240 --> 31:03.240
I mean, I don't know.

31:03.240 --> 31:04.240
All right.

31:04.240 --> 31:08.160
We got off the original topic of the Phil Spencer comments on toxic fandom, but that's

31:08.160 --> 31:09.160
okay.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.160
Tangents we love here on this show.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.720
And it's all about where the gaming industry is currently at.

31:12.720 --> 31:16.260
But to loop it back a little bit, I will just say, you know, I'm happy to see that Phil

31:16.260 --> 31:19.500
Spencer is kind of making these comments and is really kind of pushing the industry

31:19.500 --> 31:25.760
to a, together we are stronger type of place than a, you know, fuck that guy and fuck this

31:25.760 --> 31:26.900
guy type of place.

31:26.900 --> 31:30.940
Like we're in our own little, I just think, you know, working together because again,

31:30.940 --> 31:35.340
in the games industry, you've got people that will leave one company for the other and vice,

31:35.340 --> 31:36.420
you know, and all this stuff.

31:36.420 --> 31:37.940
I think it's going to be a healthy thing.

31:37.940 --> 31:43.020
And that's why I'm very happy that Phil Spencer is bringing some positivity to gaming.

31:43.020 --> 31:44.020
It's okay.

31:44.020 --> 31:46.040
You can have positivity in the gaming industry.

31:46.640 --> 31:47.640
It's a fine thing.

31:47.640 --> 31:49.160
It's going to work out fine.

31:49.160 --> 31:51.720
So all right.

31:51.720 --> 31:53.000
Some other comments in chat.

31:53.000 --> 31:57.600
Tiger Claw talking about the innovation and stuff saying that Elon Musk has that Starlink

31:57.600 --> 32:00.400
internet service he's been testing out in some places.

32:00.400 --> 32:01.400
So you're right.

32:01.400 --> 32:05.720
There might even be other types of technology that are going to bring internet to your home.

32:05.720 --> 32:09.640
Some things we haven't even thought of yet or are still, you know, in the planning stages.

32:09.640 --> 32:15.200
Black Compat in chat says, if Verizon Fios came to my area, it would be over for Comcast.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.200
Yeah.

32:16.200 --> 32:19.480
I keep waiting for that, but that's only on the East Coast.

32:19.480 --> 32:20.480
Yeah.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.600
So it's just a matter of time.

32:22.600 --> 32:23.600
It's just a matter of time.

32:23.600 --> 32:24.600
All right.

32:24.600 --> 32:27.520
Speaking of time and how we spend it, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types

32:27.520 --> 32:32.040
of video games we have been playing this week as it was a holiday week.

32:32.040 --> 32:36.320
So a good chance to catch up on the backlog over these last few days.

32:36.320 --> 32:39.000
Although Loki may be working on your own thing, but I don't know.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.440
How was your gaming week?

32:40.440 --> 32:42.920
So I didn't play really much of anything.

32:42.920 --> 32:48.240
I was trying to play a little bit of Minecraft with my kids, but they had done an update

32:48.240 --> 32:49.380
to...

32:49.380 --> 32:58.580
So they did a new update to 1.16 to bring parity between the Java and the Bedrock editions

32:58.580 --> 33:02.940
of Minecraft to add some features to kind of make them in alignment.

33:02.940 --> 33:07.980
And so they pushed a update and they hadn't pushed an update to the realms.

33:07.980 --> 33:15.020
And so it's been really hard too, because they also added realms and server access to

33:15.020 --> 33:19.140
the PlayStation version of Bedrock as well.

33:19.140 --> 33:24.180
And so it just really tanked being able to connect to realms this week.

33:24.180 --> 33:30.020
I was able to get in like a couple of times, but it was just, it was really hard.

33:30.020 --> 33:31.660
They kept timing out and everything.

33:31.660 --> 33:35.140
So I'm just waiting for that to kind of cool down a bit.

33:35.140 --> 33:39.540
But I did play my realm for like a tiny little bit, just mainly testing the connection because

33:39.540 --> 33:43.100
my kids were wanting to play, but I haven't really played anything.

33:43.100 --> 33:48.180
I still though, I've been watching Minecraft speedrunners this week.

33:48.180 --> 33:52.540
There's a couple of guys I watch, this guy, Danny, who he's developing this game right

33:52.540 --> 33:53.540
now called Carlson.

33:53.540 --> 33:57.980
So I watched him, he's a uni developer, but he's been, this entire month, he's been trying

33:57.980 --> 34:01.920
to speedrun or become a speedrunner in the Java Minecraft.

34:01.920 --> 34:03.060
And so that's really interesting to me.

34:03.060 --> 34:08.300
I kind of want to do the Bedrock stuff, you know, try it because it looks fun.

34:08.300 --> 34:14.100
And so it might be something I might try down the road and then a little bit of Orna played

34:14.100 --> 34:18.060
that and that's pretty much it.

34:18.060 --> 34:21.340
I didn't really play a lot of games, even those who have been perfect time to do that.

34:21.340 --> 34:22.900
It's all game development.

34:22.900 --> 34:23.900
That's all I've been doing.

34:23.900 --> 34:24.900
It's just solid.

34:24.900 --> 34:25.900
Any free time I have.

34:25.900 --> 34:26.900
Fair enough.

34:26.900 --> 34:29.580
Is that your brother-in-law that just joined the Orna group?

34:29.580 --> 34:31.140
I think that's who that was.

34:31.700 --> 34:33.700
I thought somebody related to you.

34:33.700 --> 34:38.500
No, it's that would be, I think that's my sister's coworker.

34:38.500 --> 34:39.500
Oh, okay.

34:39.500 --> 34:47.300
My sister and her coworker, I think maybe her boss, they'd asked about it.

34:47.300 --> 34:49.060
God, I'm not that, but yeah.

34:49.060 --> 34:50.060
So they were joining.

34:50.060 --> 34:51.060
Okay.

34:51.060 --> 34:52.060
Yeah.

34:52.060 --> 34:53.060
Neat.

34:53.060 --> 34:54.060
All right.

34:54.060 --> 34:57.040
So I had to ask, cause I was like, this person says they know Loki and they've been really

34:57.040 --> 34:59.180
going hard on all the raid bosses and stuff.

34:59.220 --> 35:00.220
Oh yeah.

35:00.220 --> 35:01.220
Finally.

35:01.220 --> 35:07.420
Like, so there was a raid boss I had popped like, God, I don't even know if it was like,

35:07.420 --> 35:12.560
he wanted to see us in the summer and like, it's just been sitting there near my house

35:12.560 --> 35:15.540
for like a long time and I've been just slowly chipping away.

35:15.540 --> 35:19.460
So I finally chipped away at it and they spawned a new one and I was like, eh.

35:19.460 --> 35:24.020
The thing that ticked me off, talking about Orna a little bit, which is, it's a GPS based

35:24.020 --> 35:26.900
game that's very influenced by 8-bit RPGs.

35:26.940 --> 35:30.020
And it's really impressive cause it's all one dude who put it together.

35:30.020 --> 35:36.820
I think the music is like, you know, somebody else and some of the art assets are certainly,

35:36.820 --> 35:41.940
you know, Loki found the pack with the art assets, but, but for the most part, you know,

35:41.940 --> 35:44.740
it is, it's one individual that's really the kind of the backbone behind it.

35:44.740 --> 35:46.680
So it's, it's pretty well done.

35:46.680 --> 35:51.740
So we play that a lot and yeah, I was kind of the same thing is that I had a raid boss

35:51.740 --> 35:55.060
just recently and it was like 7.5 million hit points.

35:55.220 --> 35:57.180
I was like, oh, it's going to take me forever.

35:57.180 --> 35:58.820
Finally just chipped it down and I'm like, okay, yay.

35:58.820 --> 36:01.540
I'm going to summon a new raid boss and maybe this will be one I can get.

36:01.540 --> 36:02.540
Yeah.

36:02.540 --> 36:04.420
The new raid boss I spawned has 15 million hit points.

36:04.420 --> 36:05.420
Really?

36:05.420 --> 36:06.420
Yeah.

36:06.420 --> 36:07.420
I got really, what is it?

36:07.420 --> 36:13.060
The, it's the same, the raid boss I have now is also the same raid boss at this month.

36:13.060 --> 36:14.060
So yeah.

36:14.060 --> 36:15.060
The sisters.

36:15.060 --> 36:16.060
Yeah.

36:16.060 --> 36:17.060
Same, same.

36:17.060 --> 36:20.820
And so I like, I don't know, like, cause even like the drops that they have, like I did

36:20.820 --> 36:24.820
go up a level, but like the drops that they have, I can't really, the drops aren't great.

36:25.580 --> 36:26.580
Yeah.

36:26.580 --> 36:27.580
So it's like.

36:27.580 --> 36:28.580
It'd be nice if you could pick the raid boss.

36:28.580 --> 36:33.380
So I had these summoning scrolls and I use them somewhere, so, you know, might as well.

36:33.380 --> 36:34.380
All right.

36:34.380 --> 36:35.380
So, okay.

36:35.380 --> 36:37.420
So if that's it for your gaming week, Loki, let me talk about my gaming week.

36:37.420 --> 36:42.180
So I've been continuing on my Xbox series X, which Alan has been calling my no man's

36:42.180 --> 36:45.540
sky machine because that's about all he ever sees me playing on it.

36:45.540 --> 36:49.580
My save file is now up to 35 hours, just shy of 35 hours.

36:49.580 --> 36:53.180
That's an addition to the 25 I spent on PlayStation four pro.

36:53.180 --> 36:55.100
And that's just two of like my seven places.

36:55.100 --> 36:58.060
So I've spent a lot of hours on no man's sky.

36:58.060 --> 37:01.820
But obviously I've been having a great time and the world's look gorgeous and next gen.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.500
So yeah, I've been enjoying that.

37:03.500 --> 37:07.880
I finally went through, so I name all my galaxies with the alphabet.

37:07.880 --> 37:12.180
So I go A, B, C, D, like all the way through the alphabet.

37:12.180 --> 37:14.980
I even found a dessert that began with X.

37:14.980 --> 37:19.060
I think it was called Shushio or something like that, which is a, like a treat in some

37:19.060 --> 37:20.700
Latin American countries or something.

37:20.700 --> 37:27.860
I even found one with X and I went all the way to Z and now I'm back at A. So I, in fact,

37:27.860 --> 37:29.540
I'm all the way back through on my second loop.

37:29.540 --> 37:34.660
I think I'm up to C. So, yeah, it's funny that I've been to so many galaxies on this

37:34.660 --> 37:36.900
play that I've actually run out of letters.

37:36.900 --> 37:38.100
So there's that.

37:38.100 --> 37:41.860
So yeah, I've been doing no man's sky, but then I was finally like, okay, I probably

37:41.860 --> 37:44.400
should be playing something else.

37:44.400 --> 37:50.340
So I started to really spend some time with Ori and the, I always want to say Ori and

37:50.380 --> 37:51.580
the Will of the Wisps.

37:51.580 --> 37:52.820
That's the new one.

37:52.820 --> 37:57.660
I went and played the first one, Ori and the Blind Forest, which I've started to play like

37:57.660 --> 38:01.020
a couple times and never got very far before I got distracted.

38:01.020 --> 38:05.740
But I made it quite a bit further this time in the Ori playthrough that I've been doing.

38:05.740 --> 38:09.620
It is the first one because in my brain I'm like, well, I can't play the second one until

38:09.620 --> 38:11.900
I've beaten the first one, right?

38:11.900 --> 38:14.280
Y'all have done something similar, I'm sure.

38:14.280 --> 38:18.900
So yeah, I've been working on the first one, the Ori and the Blind Forest.

38:18.900 --> 38:23.140
I will say I've gotten to this part where like I got an ability I wasn't expecting to

38:23.140 --> 38:24.140
get.

38:24.140 --> 38:25.660
Like I was expecting to get like a double jump.

38:25.660 --> 38:27.020
I was like, oh, how do you get up there?

38:27.020 --> 38:28.020
You must need like a double jump.

38:28.020 --> 38:29.420
I was expecting something like that.

38:29.420 --> 38:34.420
I was not expecting this ability I just got where you like tie yourselves to lanterns

38:34.420 --> 38:39.760
and use them to fling yourself through the air, but you use it with like bullets too.

38:39.760 --> 38:43.060
And you, when you do it, you fling the bullet the other way.

38:43.060 --> 38:47.280
And that becomes this whole other mechanic is that you have to basically use opponent's

38:47.280 --> 38:49.680
bullets to destroy the scenery.

38:49.680 --> 38:51.840
I got to say this about Ori.

38:51.840 --> 38:53.300
It's a cutesy game.

38:53.300 --> 38:55.880
It's a game that has a lot of feels.

38:55.880 --> 38:58.560
The beginning of the game is like watching Up, okay?

38:58.560 --> 39:00.580
That's all I'm going to say.

39:00.580 --> 39:03.320
If you've seen that movie, you know.

39:03.320 --> 39:09.520
But the thing about Ori for as cutesy and feely as it is, it is fucking hard.

39:09.520 --> 39:12.880
Like you die over and over and over again.

39:12.880 --> 39:17.080
And that's how you learn because that's how video games, you know, classic video games

39:17.080 --> 39:18.080
really were.

39:18.080 --> 39:20.680
So Ori, the difficulty can be really unforgiving.

39:20.680 --> 39:22.200
Although I am playing on normal mode.

39:22.200 --> 39:26.480
I think there is a Bobby Blackwolf mode, but I don't see how that would make it any easier.

39:26.480 --> 39:31.160
Like it might make things do less damage and stuff like that, but some of the physics games

39:31.160 --> 39:33.320
you have to play get really difficult.

39:33.320 --> 39:35.720
So yeah, it's really pretty.

39:35.720 --> 39:41.280
I haven't actually gotten a chance to play it yet, but I may have to go back and check

39:41.280 --> 39:42.840
it out.

39:42.840 --> 39:50.080
So let's see, SHO 100 Matt says, I got Ori and the Blind Forest when I got my Xbox One.

39:50.080 --> 39:51.080
Still haven't played it.

39:51.080 --> 39:54.320
Yeah, that's the thing is it was always kind of like a back burner game for me.

39:54.320 --> 39:56.360
Well, all right, time to bring it up to the front burner.

39:56.360 --> 39:59.920
So I finally really spent some time with it and yeah, I really enjoy it.

39:59.920 --> 40:02.320
The game's on Switch too, which is pretty cool.

40:02.320 --> 40:03.920
And I have some friends who played through it there.

40:03.920 --> 40:05.360
It's also on PC.

40:05.360 --> 40:08.640
So lots of options for you to check out the Ori series.

40:08.640 --> 40:14.280
I'm sure the sequel is more pretty and probably harder, so I'm excited to get there at some

40:14.280 --> 40:15.280
point.

40:15.280 --> 40:21.040
The other game I've been playing a bit of, surprisingly actually, so I talked about last

40:21.040 --> 40:25.520
week on the show where I kind of, I've put Ingress on pause for a little while, right?

40:25.520 --> 40:27.960
I'm like kind of over it with that.

40:27.960 --> 40:33.280
So I've been spending a little more time with Pokemon Go, especially in amping for the new

40:33.280 --> 40:35.840
levels, which are supposed to hit this week.

40:35.840 --> 40:40.320
I actually went downtown and I went downtown and I usually play with Bluetooth, but when

40:40.320 --> 40:42.840
I was downtown, I caught by hand and spun all the stuff.

40:42.840 --> 40:48.920
I'm up to 450 Pokeballs in my inventory, so that way when the new levels go live, I can

40:48.920 --> 40:54.280
grind with Bluetooth and try to get the 200 Pokemon in a day that you need for level 41.

40:54.280 --> 40:59.200
The raids are going to be harder for me than it will be the 200 Pokemon in a day, I think.

40:59.200 --> 41:02.560
So that's something that'll be happening this week, so that'll be interesting.

41:02.560 --> 41:07.120
But because of him spending that time in Pokemon Go, I was kind of like, well, I should check

41:07.120 --> 41:11.520
out this Pokemon Home thing, because you're supposed to be able to transfer Pokemon to

41:11.520 --> 41:13.060
Pokemon Home.

41:13.060 --> 41:17.440
So I ended up kind of picking up Pokemon Shield again and just trying to go through and complete

41:17.440 --> 41:21.920
my decks a little bit, but I've also been playing with some of the Pokemon Home transfer.

41:21.920 --> 41:26.640
So Pokemon Home is like an app that they put out on Switch and the phone, and it's basically

41:26.640 --> 41:29.520
just a storage for your Pokemon.

41:29.520 --> 41:33.640
I don't understand why they couldn't have just modernized Pokemon Bank.

41:33.640 --> 41:37.260
That's a little weird, because Pokemon Bank was the same thing on 3DS, but now they've

41:37.260 --> 41:38.760
made it more mobile.

41:38.760 --> 41:40.160
It's not the same thing?

41:40.160 --> 41:43.120
I thought that they were charging for space or something on this one.

41:43.120 --> 41:45.720
It's the same function, and yes, they are.

41:45.720 --> 41:48.480
So you get a box of 30 Pokemon.

41:48.480 --> 41:50.120
You can hold 30 Pokemon.

41:50.120 --> 41:53.360
I think it'll fit more, but you can't touch them.

41:53.360 --> 41:58.240
You can only touch the most recent 30 unless you pay, I think it's like 15 bucks a year.

41:58.280 --> 42:01.760
I haven't signed up to pay yet, but we'll see if I make it.

42:01.760 --> 42:07.120
So I transferred some of my shinies, because you know, some of the community days in Pokemon

42:07.120 --> 42:11.560
Go, I have like 12 Weedles, 11 Magmars.

42:11.560 --> 42:13.400
I don't need that many shiny Pokemon.

42:13.400 --> 42:16.720
So I put them in Pokemon Bank, and then I transferred a...

42:16.720 --> 42:19.840
I don't think you can move Weedle to Pokemon Shield, because I don't think it's in there,

42:19.840 --> 42:21.200
but Magmar you can.

42:21.200 --> 42:25.180
So I actually moved it over there, and now I have a shiny, another one in Pokemon Shield.

42:25.220 --> 42:29.060
So it's been kind of fun like doing that and trying to fill out my decks, and I think the

42:29.060 --> 42:34.780
thing that is interesting about Pokemon Home compared to Bank is that Bank was just that.

42:34.780 --> 42:36.780
It was a storage dump for your Pokemon.

42:36.780 --> 42:38.060
That's all it really was.

42:38.060 --> 42:43.700
Home has like little achievements in it as well, like you store this many Pokemon, and

42:43.700 --> 42:48.100
it has some trading that's built right into it as well, so you can trade direct from Pokemon

42:48.100 --> 42:49.100
Home.

42:49.100 --> 42:50.100
So that's interesting.

42:50.100 --> 42:54.980
In fact, I should check, because I put some Pokemon in Wonder Trade earlier.

42:54.980 --> 43:01.860
I put like a Mankey and like a Shellder that I caught, an extra one in Pokemon Shield and

43:01.860 --> 43:02.860
something else.

43:02.860 --> 43:05.620
One of the Rookidees or something.

43:05.620 --> 43:09.140
So I'm actually loading Pokemon Home right now because I want to see, because I put them

43:09.140 --> 43:12.300
up in Wonder Trade, so I'm looking, I'm bringing up the app right now.

43:12.300 --> 43:15.300
Ooh, I got an exclamation mark in Wonder Box.

43:15.300 --> 43:17.260
Oh, so all of my...

43:17.260 --> 43:19.420
Oh, I wish I could show this better on the camera.

43:19.420 --> 43:20.420
They're back.

43:20.420 --> 43:22.060
I have three new Pokemon.

43:22.060 --> 43:25.500
So let's see what new Pokemon I got from Wonder Box.

43:25.500 --> 43:26.500
So the first one...

43:26.500 --> 43:27.780
It's all trash.

43:27.780 --> 43:28.780
It's pro...

43:28.780 --> 43:29.940
Well, I sent trash.

43:29.940 --> 43:31.940
So send trash, get trash.

43:31.940 --> 43:34.060
Oh, it's a Yuri Geller.

43:34.060 --> 43:35.060
How about that?

43:35.060 --> 43:37.900
Haven't you heard that story this week, right?

43:37.900 --> 43:39.180
It's one of those.

43:39.180 --> 43:43.060
It's a Kadabra or a Yuri Geller.

43:43.060 --> 43:45.040
So that's cool.

43:45.040 --> 43:46.700
So I gave away a Drillbur.

43:46.700 --> 43:47.700
That was that.

43:47.700 --> 43:48.700
All right.

43:48.700 --> 43:49.700
The next one.

43:49.700 --> 43:51.300
Isn't this exciting, Radio?

43:51.300 --> 43:55.700
To commemorate your Wonder Box trade, I've got a special Pokemon gift for you.

43:55.700 --> 43:57.660
Make sure to get it from the gift box for mystery gifts.

43:57.660 --> 43:59.660
Oh, I didn't know you could get mystery gifts for that.

43:59.660 --> 44:05.340
See, that's the other reason to do it is that you get a special Mel Metal the first time

44:05.340 --> 44:07.860
you transfer from Pokemon Go.

44:07.860 --> 44:13.820
And then when I did the transfer from Shield into home, I got the Grookey Sobble Score

44:13.820 --> 44:18.340
Bunny Starter Set that I guess have the special move or whatever.

44:18.340 --> 44:21.260
So there you go.

44:21.260 --> 44:26.180
Let's see the next Pokemon I got, because now I'm sure you're all curious, right?

44:26.180 --> 44:27.180
Let's see.

44:27.180 --> 44:28.180
It does this cute little animation.

44:28.180 --> 44:31.340
Oh, a Lickitung.

44:31.340 --> 44:32.340
One of my faves.

44:32.340 --> 44:35.700
Oh, it's a Japanese Lickitung because it's named.

44:35.700 --> 44:36.740
It's got the Japanese name.

44:36.740 --> 44:37.740
Well, that's pretty cool.

44:37.740 --> 44:38.740
Level 16.

44:38.740 --> 44:41.260
That poor bastard got a Mankey and trade for that.

44:41.260 --> 44:42.260
All right.

44:42.260 --> 44:43.260
One more.

44:43.260 --> 44:44.260
One more.

44:44.260 --> 44:45.260
It is.

44:45.260 --> 44:47.900
Oh, it's Alolan Vulpix, which Vulpixes are cute.

44:47.900 --> 44:50.060
I mean, Alolans are everywhere.

44:50.060 --> 44:52.100
Oh, another Japanese one.

44:52.100 --> 44:53.180
So that's kind of fun.

44:53.180 --> 44:56.380
That guy got my level 60 Shellder and trade for that.

44:56.380 --> 44:57.380
So that's neat.

44:57.380 --> 44:58.380
So there you go.

44:58.380 --> 44:59.380
That's Pokemon Home.

44:59.380 --> 45:02.180
You can do some interesting stuff in that.

45:02.180 --> 45:05.440
And actdeftinchat says, yeah, there are goals for doing stuff in home.

45:05.440 --> 45:09.340
And if you complete the Pokedex, you get a special Magurna.

45:09.340 --> 45:10.540
I hope I said that right.

45:10.540 --> 45:11.540
So yeah.

45:11.540 --> 45:14.100
So you get little like incentives and then there are things you can kind of transfer

45:14.100 --> 45:15.260
back into the game.

45:15.260 --> 45:16.260
So I don't know.

45:16.260 --> 45:19.880
I've just been kind of like a little more interested in Pokemon.

45:19.880 --> 45:21.840
What else am I going to do right now?

45:21.840 --> 45:23.800
All this.

45:23.800 --> 45:25.520
Oh, Magurna.

45:25.520 --> 45:26.520
Sorry.

45:26.520 --> 45:27.520
Magurna.

45:27.520 --> 45:30.520
So what else am I going to do right now with everything that's going on in the world?

45:30.520 --> 45:32.440
So yeah, that was my Game of the Week.

45:32.440 --> 45:33.520
Added in some Ori.

45:33.520 --> 45:34.520
Did some Pokemon.

45:34.520 --> 45:36.880
Oh, Final Fantasy XIV as well.

45:36.880 --> 45:39.080
My Black Mage is almost to 80.

45:39.080 --> 45:40.800
And now I'm working on my Dragoon.

45:40.800 --> 45:45.300
I've only got three classes to go and then I will have everything at max level.

45:45.300 --> 45:47.040
So there you go.

45:47.040 --> 45:49.040
That's my Final Fantasy XIV addiction.

45:49.200 --> 45:51.480
All right, let's get into some gaming news.

45:51.480 --> 45:54.600
First off, though, let's do some housekeeping.

45:54.600 --> 45:55.600
This is fun.

45:55.600 --> 45:59.160
Because I haven't told you about this, Loki, because I just found out about this about

45:59.160 --> 46:00.160
the way.

46:00.160 --> 46:03.640
Well, I just I just found out about this about 30 minutes forward on the air tonight.

46:03.640 --> 46:07.360
But somebody is going to be making a guest appearance on next week's show.

46:07.360 --> 46:12.700
Speaking of people that have been teasing games for a little while now, Loki, somebody

46:12.700 --> 46:18.500
else who's been teasing games on this program is going to unveil their latest next week

46:18.500 --> 46:20.000
on the program.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.580
And if so, someone else is going to release another game before I do.

46:23.580 --> 46:24.580
Yes.

46:24.580 --> 46:25.580
Yes, Loki.

46:25.580 --> 46:26.580
Yes.

46:26.580 --> 46:28.140
So I can't win.

46:28.140 --> 46:34.940
If you go to our pal Y Y R's website at Y Y R Games dot com.

46:34.940 --> 46:40.540
He's teasing that next Sunday, December 6th is a Pixel Poops direct.

46:40.540 --> 46:42.700
And let me read what it says.

46:42.700 --> 47:01.260
Please join us during next week's Orange Launch Radio next week at 9 Eastern Pacific

47:01.260 --> 47:04.720
for something truly moving.

47:04.720 --> 47:06.540
You know, like your pals.

47:06.540 --> 47:07.540
I'm moving.

47:07.540 --> 47:08.540
Yes.

47:08.540 --> 47:09.820
So check that out next week.

47:09.820 --> 47:10.820
Yeah.

47:10.820 --> 47:12.860
He's got a little something, something.

47:12.860 --> 47:14.980
And we're going to debut it here on the show.

47:14.980 --> 47:18.500
Look, Ubisoft won't let us premiere stuff.

47:18.500 --> 47:20.660
EA won't let us premiere stuff.

47:20.660 --> 47:22.060
Nintendo won't let us premiere stuff.

47:22.060 --> 47:24.020
But you know who will let us premiere stuff?

47:24.020 --> 47:26.720
Y Y R. So we're going to we're going to be that meeting.

47:26.720 --> 47:37.280
And I'm excited because I'm I'm kind of curious where he's where he's putting that poop.

47:37.280 --> 47:40.780
Is it going to be like a Xbox thing, a PC thing?

47:40.780 --> 47:42.300
A Steam thing?

47:42.300 --> 47:44.480
So where are you putting your poop?

47:44.480 --> 47:47.140
So we're going to find that out next week.

47:47.140 --> 47:54.260
Well, maybe it's going on the Wii because it had a lot of shovelware.

47:54.260 --> 47:55.260
All right.

47:55.260 --> 47:58.060
Bobby Black Wolf in chat is asking, where's the Bobby Black Wolf premiere?

47:58.060 --> 48:00.460
I mean, if anywhere can premiere poop, it's Bobby Black Wolf.

48:00.460 --> 48:03.020
You did have the Tommy interview recently.

48:03.020 --> 48:06.980
Didn't you get an amico thing from that?

48:06.980 --> 48:09.220
Let us let us have our poopy moment.

48:09.220 --> 48:10.340
All right.

48:10.340 --> 48:11.340
That's next week on the show.

48:11.340 --> 48:12.820
I'm excited about that.

48:12.820 --> 48:16.900
And Dark Soccer needs to be here, really, because wasn't Pixel Poops kind of like something

48:16.900 --> 48:22.060
she just shouted off and and then Y Y R kind of ran with it.

48:22.060 --> 48:24.780
So she really needs to be here.

48:24.780 --> 48:25.780
Don't recall what.

48:25.780 --> 48:29.180
Yeah, but I think it was something that she said.

48:29.180 --> 48:30.180
Yeah.

48:30.180 --> 48:32.100
So we're going to find out on next week's show.

48:32.100 --> 48:33.100
Excited about that.

48:33.100 --> 48:34.100
All right.

48:34.100 --> 48:35.100
Let's get to the real poop.

48:35.100 --> 48:36.480
The news of the week.

48:36.480 --> 48:39.700
So, Loki, why don't you start us off tonight with some news?

48:39.700 --> 48:40.700
Yes.

48:40.700 --> 48:44.020
So Sony would say that this is a real poopy thing that you could do.

48:44.020 --> 48:47.860
That is giving away their precious gift.

48:47.860 --> 48:55.900
The PS Plus collection that was supposed to be the special gift to PlayStation five owners

48:55.900 --> 49:00.260
to have at least a basic library of some PlayStation four games that are going to be compatible

49:00.260 --> 49:04.520
with the PlayStation five you can play as an added bonus.

49:04.520 --> 49:06.860
But what did you in grateful people do?

49:06.860 --> 49:11.260
You decide to go ahead and sell that to other people.

49:11.260 --> 49:19.440
So I guess what they're doing is selling the opportunity to redeem these games, I guess,

49:19.440 --> 49:25.820
by logging into their account or logging into it in account somehow to be able to download

49:25.820 --> 49:31.980
the games to other systems instead of actually the owner of the PlayStation five.

49:31.980 --> 49:37.920
And so what has this what they have done now is because of this, they've started banning

49:37.920 --> 49:40.180
accounts that are selling these.

49:40.180 --> 49:42.960
Most of these seem to be out of Hong Kong.

49:42.960 --> 49:46.280
Apparently they're the ones that are doing the most of this.

49:46.280 --> 49:53.080
But still, like, how how could you give away, you know, their special gift to you?

49:53.080 --> 49:58.040
I mean, granted, because you had it all through PS Plus already granted like, yeah, I do have

49:58.040 --> 49:59.840
most of the stuff in my library already.

49:59.840 --> 50:05.300
But like, I mean, where a buck can be made, people are going to try to make it.

50:05.300 --> 50:09.900
So I'm not like, is it is it a code that comes in the box or something?

50:09.900 --> 50:14.880
I know what what I thought it was you you sign into your account on a PlayStation five

50:14.880 --> 50:16.580
and then it unlocks it right.

50:16.580 --> 50:19.460
So people are paying for that permission.

50:19.460 --> 50:20.460
Yeah.

50:20.460 --> 50:26.660
So what they're doing is I guess it's they're allowing somebody else to sign into their

50:26.660 --> 50:32.080
PlayStation five or they're logging in with that PlayStation five, which will then allow

50:32.080 --> 50:40.000
them to download that to or put it in their library, I guess.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.180
I don't know.

50:41.180 --> 50:46.720
But apparently what they're doing, though, is they are banning folks with their they're

50:46.720 --> 50:57.940
doing like like upwards to like a two month ban or some of them are actually making OK,

50:57.940 --> 51:02.400
so the the folks that are actually selling them are getting permanent bans.

51:02.400 --> 51:06.540
The people that are purchasing the PlayStation four accounts are getting two month bans.

51:06.540 --> 51:07.700
Well, thanks.

51:07.700 --> 51:09.780
Thanks to this story, making the rounds everywhere.

51:09.780 --> 51:13.960
Now I've learned that if I log into someone else's PlayStation five, I should be able

51:13.960 --> 51:15.260
to unlock this for myself.

51:15.260 --> 51:16.260
Right.

51:16.800 --> 51:18.960
Let's say we don't trade money, OK?

51:18.960 --> 51:24.000
But like I go to a friend's house, let's say or let's say, you know, like Shane is a friend

51:24.000 --> 51:25.520
of mine and has a PlayStation five.

51:25.520 --> 51:27.560
He was on the show a couple of weeks ago talking about it.

51:27.560 --> 51:28.920
What if it's not a money thing?

51:28.920 --> 51:33.580
It's just, hey, Rob is visiting and logs into my PlayStation five and now he has access

51:33.580 --> 51:34.580
to it.

51:34.580 --> 51:40.440
Like, are we going to get banned because I went on to my friend's PlayStation five?

51:40.440 --> 51:41.480
I don't know.

51:41.480 --> 51:46.080
I remember we talked about this a while back with account sharing because folks are doing

51:46.100 --> 51:53.820
that before, like they were allowing it was an issue where like you, the person that owned

51:53.820 --> 52:00.140
the game could actually download it to a system and that any user on that system could play

52:00.140 --> 52:01.140
it.

52:01.140 --> 52:02.140
Yeah.

52:02.140 --> 52:03.140
And we were having like it was a while back.

52:03.140 --> 52:08.540
I think it was like the launch of the PlayStation four where people were sharing accounts.

52:08.540 --> 52:10.620
You do it on the PlayStation three.

52:10.620 --> 52:11.620
Alan and I did it.

52:11.620 --> 52:15.900
I mean, but we were in a relationship like we shared a lot of things.

52:15.900 --> 52:19.800
So of course we did that, but like there would be things he bought on PlayStation three

52:19.800 --> 52:24.120
and so he'd log into my thing, I download them and now I have them or vice versa.

52:24.120 --> 52:27.720
You know, but that, I mean, we're not selling it to each other.

52:27.720 --> 52:29.080
Like we're in a relationship.

52:29.080 --> 52:30.720
There's certain things, you know what I mean?

52:30.720 --> 52:33.480
Like it's just, yes, we're going to share some things.

52:33.480 --> 52:38.920
So what happened, what the thought is though, is it may have been that these folks aren't

52:38.920 --> 52:41.120
necessarily sharing it with one person.

52:41.120 --> 52:43.780
They're sharing it with a lot of people.

52:43.780 --> 52:44.780
So like for example,

52:45.240 --> 52:47.240
And that's, what's getting them flagged probably.

52:47.240 --> 52:51.040
Yeah, because they're saying that the thought is it says it's believed that a PlayStation

52:51.040 --> 52:55.360
automatically bends consoles where logs in a high number of users, user accounts in a

52:55.360 --> 52:58.260
single day in order to protect it from fraud.

52:58.260 --> 53:02.000
So they're thinking, I don't think it's necessarily that they're just having one other person

53:02.000 --> 53:04.420
sign in because that's not necessarily unusual.

53:04.420 --> 53:08.120
Like are you going to have to be in a household with two people that own two different PlayStations

53:08.120 --> 53:09.960
and maybe you want to log into each of your own accounts.

53:09.960 --> 53:13.920
And I think that's completely legit, but I think it's when they're having like 30 people

53:13.940 --> 53:14.940
log into that.

53:14.940 --> 53:15.940
I get it.

53:15.940 --> 53:18.700
They're like, hmm, that's a little suspicious.

53:18.700 --> 53:22.000
So Bobby in chat says, how do they know you paid money for it and what happens if I log

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
back into my PS4?

53:23.000 --> 53:24.420
Well, they think I sold it to myself.

53:24.420 --> 53:28.380
So it sounds like the trick may be, I mean, again, Sony doesn't tell us because if they

53:28.380 --> 53:32.260
told us how they figured it out, then people would know how to go around it.

53:32.260 --> 53:36.300
But it could be that, you know, if you've got one PlayStation five where literally a

53:36.300 --> 53:40.720
hundred people have logged into it because the guy keeps flipping it on eBay, that probably

53:40.720 --> 53:42.580
was a red flag for Sony.

53:42.580 --> 53:43.580
Yeah.

53:43.960 --> 53:51.560
But like if Bobby and his wife log into each other's devices, that shouldn't trigger anything,

53:51.560 --> 53:52.560
you know?

53:52.560 --> 53:54.560
Yeah, it shouldn't.

53:54.560 --> 53:59.720
DGRMS says, plus it's probably tracked via IP address, so that's probably a big one as

53:59.720 --> 54:00.720
well.

54:00.720 --> 54:06.300
Like, why are all these American accounts signing into this Hong Kong based PlayStation?

54:06.300 --> 54:10.880
Like maybe one or two, you know, because family can be anywhere, everywhere.

54:10.880 --> 54:11.880
Right.

54:11.880 --> 54:12.880
But not 50.

54:12.880 --> 54:13.880
Right.

54:13.880 --> 54:17.300
So that those are probably the types of things that are setting off red flags at Sony, I

54:17.300 --> 54:18.300
imagine.

54:18.300 --> 54:19.300
But yeah.

54:19.300 --> 54:20.300
And so I don't know.

54:20.300 --> 54:26.780
It just I mean, it's obviously they're going to catch on if it's that frequent.

54:26.780 --> 54:27.780
Yeah.

54:27.780 --> 54:30.740
But, I don't know, we'll have to see.

54:30.740 --> 54:31.740
Yeah.

54:31.740 --> 54:34.620
And how badly do we need this PlayStation four collection anyway?

54:34.620 --> 54:36.100
Like I'm not knocking it.

54:36.100 --> 54:37.100
I'm not knocking it.

54:37.100 --> 54:38.100
It's a nice little deal.

54:38.100 --> 54:42.700
And especially like if you skipped PlayStation four entirely for whatever reason, and now

54:42.720 --> 54:46.400
you know, you're coming from a PS two or a PS three to a PS five.

54:46.400 --> 54:50.920
It's a great thing to have because, you know, now it's like, here's everything you missed.

54:50.920 --> 54:52.280
So it's a huge bonus.

54:52.280 --> 54:58.280
But like outside of that, like especially for like, you know, gamers who have experienced

54:58.280 --> 55:00.520
PlayStation four and kind of bought the big hit.

55:00.520 --> 55:05.680
Is it that important that you've got to be logging into a PS five in Hong Kong to get

55:05.680 --> 55:06.680
the library?

55:06.680 --> 55:09.640
Well, I don't think it's necessarily that you're logging into a Hong Kong PS five.

55:09.640 --> 55:13.780
I think it's just a lot of users that were in Hong Kong were doing this.

55:13.780 --> 55:18.740
So it's like necessarily, I think across the board, you know, a lot of people could be

55:18.740 --> 55:22.700
doing it anywhere, but it's just that there was a lot of users that they saw that were

55:22.700 --> 55:23.700
in Hong Kong.

55:23.700 --> 55:24.700
Yeah.

55:24.700 --> 55:30.220
I guess those, I mean, I'm judging you Hong Kong PlayStation users.

55:30.220 --> 55:33.740
Only the ones who sell for money, the Uber capitalist ones.

55:33.740 --> 55:34.740
I get it.

55:34.740 --> 55:38.300
Like it's an expensive console, but like, and you're probably thinking, well, you know,

55:38.300 --> 55:42.760
I don't need these cause I have, you know, all these games already, it'd be different.

55:42.760 --> 55:47.120
Like if it was like a code that was in your PlayStation five box or something like that,

55:47.120 --> 55:52.520
and you're selling that, whereas that might be slightly frowned upon by Sony.

55:52.520 --> 55:57.680
It's not necessarily, I think illegal to do that, but you know, being that this is tied

55:57.680 --> 56:03.860
to your console and when any account logs in, gets these games unlocked, okay.

56:03.860 --> 56:10.240
That wasn't the best way to do it, but you know, it's, I don't know.

56:10.240 --> 56:11.240
Let me get careful.

56:11.240 --> 56:13.160
Let me get some other comments from chat on all this.

56:13.160 --> 56:18.480
Fifth dream over at twitch.tv slash vog network says this is worse than animal crossing trades.

56:18.480 --> 56:22.720
One a shit item, 300 nook mile tickets or we kick out out.

56:22.720 --> 56:25.640
Yes, is worse than animal crossings now.

56:25.640 --> 56:26.640
Let's see.

56:26.640 --> 56:32.780
Phoenix 77 26 says that's like asking how someone never me, never can share their Disney

56:32.800 --> 56:35.400
plus account with friends.

56:35.400 --> 56:41.000
I'm laughing because literally on Thursday I was like, Oh dad, you like national geographic,

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
right?

56:42.000 --> 56:44.280
Oh, you're going to love this.

56:44.280 --> 56:45.280
Logged them in.

56:45.280 --> 56:50.680
But the thing is like, and these companies like Disney plus and Netflix and so on, they're

56:50.680 --> 56:56.840
pretty transparent now with what they're monitoring because like, I think Disney allows two concurrent

56:56.840 --> 56:57.840
streams, right?

56:57.840 --> 56:59.200
Am I right?

56:59.200 --> 57:00.860
It's two concurrent streams on Disney.

57:00.860 --> 57:04.100
It's like two or four on Netflix, depending on your plan.

57:04.100 --> 57:07.320
So it's like, they're telling you, like, if you do more than two, the others are going

57:07.320 --> 57:08.320
to get knocked off.

57:08.320 --> 57:09.320
Well, guess what?

57:09.320 --> 57:13.340
Like, nobody's ever going to watch Disney, not on my big screen TV and then my dad maybe

57:13.340 --> 57:14.340
occasionally.

57:14.340 --> 57:17.960
So there's two, but again, I kind of think there's a big difference between you sharing

57:17.960 --> 57:23.240
it with a family member and you're selling it on eBay to make a profit and help pay for

57:23.240 --> 57:24.240
it.

57:24.240 --> 57:25.240
You know what I mean?

57:25.240 --> 57:26.240
Yeah.

57:26.240 --> 57:27.240
Big difference.

57:27.240 --> 57:28.240
Big difference.

57:28.240 --> 57:29.240
So, all right.

57:29.240 --> 57:30.240
Let's see.

57:30.620 --> 57:33.260
200 Matt says Disney plus allows four concurrent streams.

57:33.260 --> 57:35.140
Well then, I got two more up for grabs.

57:35.140 --> 57:36.140
Loki, you have Disney plus?

57:36.140 --> 57:37.140
All right.

57:37.140 --> 57:38.140
I do.

57:38.140 --> 57:39.140
Okay.

57:39.140 --> 57:40.140
I don't use it either.

57:40.140 --> 57:41.140
Moving on.

57:41.140 --> 57:42.620
You need to watch the second season of Mandalorian.

57:42.620 --> 57:43.620
I use it once in a while.

57:43.620 --> 57:45.100
I haven't even starred in Mandalorian.

57:45.100 --> 57:46.940
I need to, but I do watch Sister Act.

57:46.940 --> 57:52.060
I watched the first season, but it's starting to get into spoiler territory with online.

57:52.060 --> 57:54.900
So I'm thinking I have to jump into season two.

57:54.900 --> 57:57.300
I just haven't really been motivated to.

57:57.300 --> 57:58.300
It was all right.

57:58.360 --> 58:02.600
It was just not like, it wasn't like the boys where I was like, I got, I got to have season

58:02.600 --> 58:04.440
two, you know, immediately.

58:04.440 --> 58:06.400
Whereas Mandalorian is like, yeah, I'll watch it.

58:06.400 --> 58:07.400
It was good.

58:07.400 --> 58:11.680
But it wasn't like, I'm like, just die hard and got to watch it.

58:11.680 --> 58:16.240
Bobby Blackwell says four concurrent is one of the norms to allow a family with two kids

58:16.240 --> 58:18.600
to all be streaming at the same time.

58:18.600 --> 58:19.880
Comcast likes this.

58:19.880 --> 58:20.880
Yeah.

58:20.880 --> 58:23.800
There you go again with those bandwidth caps and they're, they're all watching things in

58:23.800 --> 58:25.840
4k on National Geographic.

58:25.840 --> 58:28.160
Then, you know, goodbye bandwidth.

58:29.020 --> 58:31.220
You know what Comcast would really like?

58:31.220 --> 58:36.460
For you to check out Peacock because Comcast, NBC and all that is in one big thing.

58:36.460 --> 58:40.860
But although I have heard good things about the Saved by the Bell redo or whatever it

58:40.860 --> 58:42.740
is, continuation series, I don't know.

58:42.740 --> 58:46.300
It's the modern Saved by the Bell and that's all on Peacock.

58:46.300 --> 58:50.540
But I'm kind of surprised and, you know, I maybe with net neutrality coming back, this

58:50.540 --> 58:51.540
wouldn't really be a thing.

58:51.540 --> 58:55.260
I'm kind of surprised Comcast just hasn't said, Hey, if you watch these things on Peacock,

58:55.260 --> 58:58.140
it won't count towards your bandwidth.

58:58.160 --> 58:59.160
Maybe that's coming.

58:59.160 --> 59:00.160
I don't know.

59:00.160 --> 59:02.480
All right, moving on.

59:02.480 --> 59:03.840
Let's go to another story.

59:03.840 --> 59:09.400
Let's talk about a game that many people are very fond of and still are kind of surprised

59:09.400 --> 59:13.360
maybe because it's been so long that a sequel is incoming for this game.

59:13.360 --> 59:17.720
It is the game The World Ends With You.

59:17.720 --> 59:18.720
That's right.

59:18.720 --> 59:21.080
The World Ends With You originally came out for the DS.

59:21.080 --> 59:22.760
It's it's several years old.

59:22.760 --> 59:26.360
In fact, I think it's old enough that dark soccer did it as classic game of the week.

59:26.420 --> 59:29.100
I think relatively recently.

59:29.100 --> 59:32.140
So yeah, it's it's not it's not a redo.

59:32.140 --> 59:35.140
They already did that on the mobile devices and all that.

59:35.140 --> 59:36.640
Not that long ago.

59:36.640 --> 59:40.460
This is an actual sequel, new characters, new gameplay and so on.

59:40.460 --> 59:42.500
It is called Neo.

59:42.500 --> 59:44.220
The world ends with you.

59:44.220 --> 59:48.420
Not to be confused with a character from the Matrix, but you will be going back into the

59:48.420 --> 59:53.300
Reapers game as Rindo and you will team up with some new people and some familiar faces

59:53.300 --> 59:56.020
as well to defeat the Game Master.

59:56.020 --> 01:00:00.420
Everything is now in 3D, but still kind of has that similar style to it.

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:06.660
You will have a newly reimagined action combat system and some more answers from the previously

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:07.900
launched story.

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:10.640
This will be coming in summer 2021.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:14.760
It is currently scheduled for the PlayStation 4 and the Nintendo Switch.

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:18.720
So no word as of now about Xbox.

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:23.760
Don't know if that's maybe because this announcement kind of came out of Japan where Xbox still

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:25.760
really isn't a factor.

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:31.220
Square Enix has been doing things with Microsoft because I know I'm personally hyped for the

01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:35.340
Dragon Quest XI remaster coming to Game Pass in the next week actually.

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:37.860
That's probably something I'll talk about next week during my gaming week.

01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:41.440
But that's going to be great to experience again in 60 frames a second and all that stuff

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.920
that Xbox Series X will provide.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:48.860
And then like all the Kingdom Hearts games are on Game Pass too, so we don't know about

01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:49.860
Microsoft yet.

01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:51.180
Maybe it'll be delayed by a year.

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:53.780
A lot of the stuff has been.

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:55.760
Right now, no word on that.

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:58.640
It's just PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.560
But you can, if you want to check out the original game, that final remix of The World

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:06.880
Ends With You, and I think that's the version that they did for the mobile phones and stuff,

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:09.080
that is also out on the Switch.

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:12.840
So you can check that out if you want.

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:18.240
ActDeftInChat says, there were also new screens of The World Ends With You anime launching

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:19.240
next year.

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:22.740
So this series is coming back in a big way.

01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:25.960
Are you surprised, Loki, that this game is getting a sequel?

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:28.640
I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:29.640
It's always-

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:36.280
I never played the first one, but I'm not surprised, I guess, because, I don't know,

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:38.080
nothing surprises me anymore.

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:41.120
Well, you know what game I was surprised got a sequel?

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:42.120
Was Nier.

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:43.120
You remember that?

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:47.000
And that was on the Xbox 360 here, and we had kind of a different version of that than

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.520
they had in Japan.

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:53.980
And I remember thinking, I don't think this game did well enough to necessitate a sequel,

01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:59.380
and then the sequel comes out years later, is a big surprise, and one of the greatest

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:04.880
video games of the year, and some would argue the decade, or even ever, gets released.

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.380
So sometimes these sequels-

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:07.380
Still haven't played it yet.

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:08.380
Oh, you should.

01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:09.380
It's good.

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:10.380
I know.

01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:15.980
I remember the original Nier, but other than the name, they didn't really resemble each

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:16.980
other.

01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:21.740
Just throw the original Nier on 360 out of your mind.

01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:24.760
This is a new thing, and you didn't need to play the original to understand it, and you'll

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:25.760
be fine.

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:26.760
I understand that.

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:31.240
I get that, but it just never- I don't know.

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:37.600
I'm not familiar with the universe of the original Nier to know whether or not this

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:44.640
was basically in the same universe, or if it's tied together other than in name only.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:51.260
AkumaJP in chat says Nier has hardcore fandom, but that's also kind of a Japan versus US

01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:52.260
thing.

01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:56.260
Of course, that game has fandom now, but I'm talking like pre-Nier Automata.

01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:59.700
We only had that 360 version, which I think was a completely separate game you guys had

01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:01.020
in Japan.

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:06.680
That one they're redoing is brand new for us in America, which it's weird how it all

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:14.340
works out, but yeah, I didn't think that fandom before Automata, again, was here in the

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:16.140
States, but it's certainly there now.

01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:19.880
People loved Nier Automata, and I understand- I've played enough of it to understand why

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:22.220
people love that game so damn much.

01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:25.160
So great music, my god.

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.600
So yeah.

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:31.300
And AkDef says if you want to go full canon, Nier is part of the Drakengard universe.

01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:32.300
That's true.

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:35.760
I remember hearing that, so yeah, neat.

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.400
All right, let's move on.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:40.800
So that's cool that World Ends With You is getting a sequel after all this time as well,

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:44.780
because it has had its fans that were pretty hardcore over the years, so they're getting

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:48.940
rewarded in a big way, not just with a new game, but with the anime.

01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:52.040
Who's not being rewarded, Loki?

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:59.660
If you bought a Wii U and you own Super Mario Maker, well, you're not going to be able to-

01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:06.600
they're removing the course share function starting, of course, on that ever so popular

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:11.600
date with Nintendo removing things, March 31st, 2021.

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:13.860
The end of the fiscal year.

01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:16.580
The day that they just say, you know what, Mario?

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:18.440
You had your 35th anniversary.

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:21.700
Now we're just kicking you in the pants during in the trash.

01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:24.120
Oh, mama mia.

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:26.660
They're just removing everything at that time.

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:34.540
So apparently if you have Super Mario Maker for Wii U, the game will be removed from sale

01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:39.140
on Nintendo eShop as well on January 13th, 2021.

01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:42.400
Mario will be deleted on March 31st.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:45.960
And then also apparently, though, they just reminding you it's not going to have any impact

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:48.440
on the second game.

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:55.320
Also Super Mario Maker Bookmark is the service on that website is also ending as well.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:05:00.760
They say it won't be possible to look up any bookmark courses on the Wii U version of the

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:02.840
course world.

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:08.460
But you can still play, I guess, courses that were- it says it will still be possible to

01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:12.640
play courses that were uploaded before the course upload feature was discontinued and

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:15.700
to redownload the game after its removal from the eShop.

01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:16.700
Oh, thank you.

01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:20.660
Well, that's nice that I can redownload the game that I purchased.

01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:27.540
For now, until they close the Wii U eShop permanently, which I would be really surprised if that's

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:32.600
not in the next two years, I'm going to say, is that the Wii U shop goes kaput, just like

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.020
the Wii shop did.

01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:35.700
So it's a matter of time.

01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:38.480
And that's that's some of the problem with these online games.

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:43.560
I mean, it's nice that at least you can go online and still get the levels.

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:46.600
You're just not going to be able to add to the very large repository of levels.

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:50.560
And the only bummer about this, and I do understand, and Dart to see you in chat says, well, to

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.760
be fair, they did put out a sequel.

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:55.800
So they're probably assuming more people are playing on that now.

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:56.800
Correct.

01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:58.700
More people own a Switch than on the Wii U.

01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:04.800
But let's not forget, there were some things, not many, but there were some things that

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:09.640
Mario Maker first one could do that the sequel can't do.

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:16.420
For example, one of my levels that I did only can exist in the first game because I used

01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:18.460
the amiibo characters.

01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:21.060
And that's not that's probably the biggest thing that's not in the sequel.

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:22.840
And I wish it was.

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:23.840
I miss it.

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:27.540
Like that was that was a fun little thing in the 8-bit mode, and I don't understand

01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:29.580
why they didn't bring that over.

01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:33.260
Maybe it was a licensing thing with some of the extra characters, then fine, take the

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:35.020
non amiibo characters out or whatever.

01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:39.460
But I'm just surprised that never made its way to Mario Maker 2.

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:44.100
Because otherwise, why can't they just be like, we're going to take all your original

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:46.860
levels and put them in the Mario 2 database?

01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:48.540
But they can't really do that.

01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:51.460
Yeah, it's just probably different.

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:55.360
And then also, there's still the 3DS version, which I think is that stuff as well.

01:06:55.360 --> 01:07:00.000
And oh, yeah, I forgot about the 3DS version.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Whoops.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:07.920
Yeah, so oh, well, yeah, um, fifth dream points out baby metal was a thing and Mario made

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:08.920
this right.

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:11.440
And dark Tetsuya talking about the licensing says, oh, that's true.

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:12.720
It might have been licensing.

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:17.600
Like I love the Hello Kitty skin lol Yeah, some of that stuff would probably be hard

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.500
to get in Mario Maker 2.

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:23.560
But there was also a ton of stuff that was Nintendo's own stuff.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:27.340
You know, most of those amiibos are all Nintendo's own things.

01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:30.340
So they shouldn't have had such a hard time bringing that over.

01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:32.460
They just didn't do it for whatever reason.

01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:35.500
Act F does point out we got the link thing in Mario Maker 2.

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:38.540
And that was really cool because that brought new mechanics with it as well.

01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:42.260
And maybe that was the level Nintendo wanted new characters to be at.

01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:47.420
But I don't know, they've kind of they've ended major support for Mario Maker 2 already,

01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:48.420
right?

01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:49.420
Like, yes, you can still upload.

01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:52.760
It's not the same that you still upload levels and the community is still there and everything.

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:56.840
But they're, they're not planning to, like they said, the last major patch was the last

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.480
major patch, right?

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:00.480
Pretty sure.

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:01.480
Yeah.

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:02.480
I don't know.

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:05.080
It is kind of disappointing that they didn't do more with this.

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:06.560
I was hoping they'd have more in there.

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:09.280
But maybe they're saving it for Mario Maker 3 or something.

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:10.280
Maybe.

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:11.280
I don't know.

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:12.280
Yeah.

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:17.940
Anyway, so those of you that are still gaming on your Wii U, TikTok, because I don't know

01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:23.060
what's left on Wii U that's not on the Switch or going to be on the Switch.

01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:25.100
Everything has to be at the end of this fiscal year.

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:30.500
Like it's so weird that so many things are being discontinued on the 31st.

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:31.740
Like I don't know.

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:34.780
Is it some type of server cost they can write out for the next year?

01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:37.540
I would think it would be miniscule, but I don't know.

01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:38.540
It's weird, though.

01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:40.260
It's just, it seems odd.

01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:41.740
I guess we'll have to wait and see.

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:43.200
Oh, thank you.

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:44.200
Dr. Seo points out a really good one.

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:46.680
Xenoblade X. Real soon, I hope.

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:53.140
I hope that's one of the ones that they poured over to the Switch, but we'll see.

01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:58.240
Maybe they're waiting for that Switch Pro, and then they're going to do a souped up Xenoblade

01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:02.000
X, kind of like they did the other Xenoblade.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I don't know.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.760
Just a crazy thought.

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:08.320
So Sia Tabiri suggests Earthbound and Earthbound Zero from the Virtual Console.

01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:13.260
Yeah, it would be nice to get those games in Nintendo's new Switch system, wouldn't

01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:14.260
it?

01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:15.260
Hmm.

01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:16.260
All right.

01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:21.860
Anyhow, let's move on and talk about, so we've got old consoles no longer being supported.

01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:26.260
How about old consoles still being supported by Natsume?

01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:31.780
Because they are doing some rereleases, get this, on the NES and the Game Boy Color.

01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:37.280
And when I talk about rereleases, I'm not talking about like these games now available

01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:45.000
on the Switch, I'm talking about get an actual NES cartridge for Shadow of the Ninja.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
So you can check that out.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.000
It's a partnership.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Oh, that's cool.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.660
Yeah, it's a partnership with Limited Run Games to actually rerelease some of their

01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:51.660
games.

01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:56.300
So Shadow of the Ninja, originally from the year 1990, and Return of the Ninja for the

01:09:56.300 --> 01:10:00.180
Game Boy Color from 2001 are going to be released by Limited Run Games.

01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:02.420
They will work on the original hardware.

01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:06.140
So this is an actual cartridge in both cases that will work.

01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:10.680
The pre-orders already went up, so they're probably already gone, sorry.

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:12.400
But that is something that happened.

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.560
So who knows, maybe there'll be more in the future.

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:18.120
But I just thought that was really neat that, you know, and this isn't the first, wasn't

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:21.160
there like a Mega Man game recently or something too that?

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:22.600
It wasn't too recent.

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:29.480
It was a while ago they did Mega Man 9, I want to say they did a physical release of

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:30.480
that.

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:31.480
Yeah.

01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:36.780
I don't remember if they did 10 as well, but I know 9 I think was done, because they released

01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:41.380
that in like the eShop, or not eShop, well actually it might have been the eShop actually.

01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:47.700
All the online services, and then they also did a limited edition cart that you could

01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:48.700
buy as well.

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:54.140
And then of that there was even an even more limited edition cart that was like blue or

01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:55.140
something.

01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:56.140
Yeah, yeah, I remember that.

01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:58.180
Dart 2 Studio says, I thought this was cool.

01:10:58.180 --> 01:10:59.860
I played a bit of that on Switch Online.

01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:01.160
It was kind of fun.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:02.160
Super tough though.

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:06.160
And yeah, that's one thing that should be called out is that this game is actually on.

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:10.100
It was very recently added to the Switch Online service.

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:18.020
So if you have the classic Nintendo Entertainment System collection as a Nintendo Online subscriber,

01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:20.920
if you go in there, you can actually play this game.

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:24.580
So it is, it's really something that like in addition to that, they're still putting

01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:25.580
it out on cartridge.

01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:29.500
Now, I imagine they're not making a lot of them, and the pre-orders I'm sure sold out

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:31.540
within less than a day.

01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:35.380
But it's neat that that market is still there for these things to be playable on the original

01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:36.380
hardware.

01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:41.560
Oh, and YYR actually points out that the games are actually still available, so they didn't

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:44.760
instantly sell out, because usually these things do.

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:48.640
Maybe the titles are a little too obscure for some people, I don't know, but that is

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:49.920
something you can get on if you want.

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:53.220
Or maybe they're going to print as many as get ordered, I don't know.

01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:55.220
So it's kind of neat.

01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:57.720
All right, let's move on.

01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:58.720
Loki.

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:04.580
All right, so Fall Guys season three is obviously right around the corner.

01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:08.860
And so the tease, what the reveal of what the season was going to be, they decided to

01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:10.260
do something kind of fun.

01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:17.820
They decided to split up the teaser image into a 300 piece jigsaw puzzle, and offered

01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:24.140
it to folks on Twitter and Discord, and had them work together to try to put together

01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:27.960
the puzzle, which they did within a few hours.

01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:35.060
And so now it's going to be, it looks like a winter-themed Fall Guys, which I guess is

01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:36.060
appropriate.

01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:38.140
But yeah, it's pretty cool.

01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:44.740
So they've got snowmen and penguins, so yeah, so that'll be coming pretty soon.

01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:45.740
Neat.

01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:50.380
Akdeftnchat says, I got to level 40 on season two last week, and I'm looking forward to

01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:51.380
season three.

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:54.980
Yeah, Winter Knockout is what it's called, I guess.

01:12:54.980 --> 01:13:02.240
So they don't have a date when it's supposed to launch yet, but you know, the Game Awards

01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:07.140
right around the corner, so I guess they get a release date for that, so we'll see.

01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:10.600
By the way, since it didn't make tonight's show roll and you brought up the Game Awards,

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:16.260
have you heard the most recent fan wank about the Game Awards and what's set to be announced?

01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:17.720
I don't know if I believe it.

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:21.920
This rumor's been coming up too many times where it's almost becoming self-parody.

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:28.100
If it happens, great, but it is the Hideo Kojima Silent Hills on PlayStation thing,

01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:31.660
and you know that's been going around for a while, and now they're saying, this is it,

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:32.660
it's happening.

01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:33.660
Game Awards.

01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:39.160
If it does, if it doesn't, I'm not going to be disappointed.

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:46.020
What would be really cool though, again, this is total tinfoil hat, fan wank city, this

01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:51.160
isn't going to happen, but I'm going to say it anyway, if on the day of the game rewards

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:57.540
they release the PT again for PlayStation 5, because Silent Hills is happening, and

01:13:57.540 --> 01:14:02.620
that's why Konami was holding it back.

01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:04.620
Just saying, just saying.

01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:07.780
It would be amazing, but it's not going to happen.

01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:15.340
I've learned to live with a lot of disappointment in the year 2020, so I'm not going to have

01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:16.500
my hopes.

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:18.400
So there's one more for you.

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:19.400
Yeah.

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:20.400
Yeah.

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:23.220
We'd like to think that there's going to be a Grand Theft Auto 6 announcement at some

01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:24.220
point.

01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:25.220
Sure.

01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:26.220
Nah.

01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:27.220
I, you know.

01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:31.700
When, the game awards are what, December 10th, is that Thursday night that that's happening?

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:35.020
Bobby, are we doing a game awards thingy again?

01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:39.380
Because it's, I can't believe it's been a year since the last one, my God, time flies.

01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:41.660
This year has been crazy.

01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:48.180
But I do remember we did a, like a thing where we watched the game awards and we live reacted

01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:53.040
and everything, because I feel like we need to do one so that if that does happen, we

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:55.240
need a live react.

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:56.240
So all right.

01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:58.680
Bobby says we can, so please look forward to it.

01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:01.720
We'll do a live react thing on the 10th for the game awards.

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:02.720
That'll be fun.

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:04.280
All right.

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:05.820
Let's move on.

01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:10.760
Let's talk about something that will be happening, and it's a retro thing all over.

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:14.360
It's another micro console because these collectibles, they're everywhere.

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.480
Capcom is doing their own.

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:20.780
It's a new one that they're doing, and it's going to be available for the holiday season

01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:21.780
in Japan.

01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:24.280
I don't know when it's coming here.

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:28.900
It's actually coming, excuse me, to Japan this week on December the 1st.

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:31.080
So maybe some folks will want to import that.

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:36.940
It is a tiny little Capcom arcade player, and it actually has Mega Man, the power battle

01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:39.340
and Mega Man 2, the power fighters.

01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:43.920
So those Mega Man fighting games that, you know, you don't, I'm sure those of you with

01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:47.840
Mame probably checked it out at some point in your life, but you know, I don't think

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:52.100
a lot of people here necessarily played those games a lot, so it'll be neat that those are

01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:53.100
out.

01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:54.720
Well, I think they had it in those Mega Man collections.

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:55.720
They had the power battles.

01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:56.960
Oh, they did.

01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:58.260
They did, and one of them they did.

01:15:58.260 --> 01:15:59.260
Maybe even soccer.

01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:04.860
I remember, I never played Mega Man soccer, but I can tell you that many times at Blockbuster

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:09.260
I looked at the back of that and going, did I rent this?

01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:11.520
And then I never did.

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:16.260
Also coming out Street Fighter 2, Super Street Fighter 2, Super Puzzle Fighter 2.

01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:21.820
So it's an interesting kind of like Street Fighter slash Mega Man hybrid thing, but okay.

01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:23.740
I mean, that seems pretty cool.

01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:26.980
It's cute because it has like the whole six button design, even though it's like super

01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:28.220
tiny.

01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:35.400
It's going to be about $210, or if you want in yen, it's 21,780 yen.

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:40.180
So it's like a cross between a CRT TV and Mega Man's helmet.

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:45.040
Yeah, it's the folks that did the Neo Geo Mini are actually making this, and I actually

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:48.000
have a Neo Geo Mini, and it's cute.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.260
So this is pretty expensive, but I'll be curious, I want to check it out.

01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:57.920
So no word yet if it'll release here, but I'm sure that won't stop some folks from importing

01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:59.760
it, that's for sure.

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:04.960
All right, let's get to the classic game of the week, shall we?

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:07.360
Since we're on classic games anyway.

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:11.300
Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, we invite Dark Soccer to step into the gaming

01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:16.740
vault, and find a game that she thinks, hey, you brats should check out this game this

01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:17.740
week.

01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:22.420
It's a classic game, and you got to respect the classics, because that's how we got here.

01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:24.100
And of course, Dark Soccer's not here tonight.

01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:28.240
I mentioned earlier she has the night off, and I was going to try to invite somebody

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:33.820
on, but I didn't have a ton of notice, so I wasn't able to get anybody to fill in.

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:38.000
So I'm going to fill in with the classic game of the week, and do something.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.320
I think I'd put this on the back burner a long time ago, but I went through the wiki,

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:47.000
and I never picked this one, and this one is kind of like an interesting sort of game.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:53.400
It's an entry in a long running series that I think most people have really forgot about.

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:59.520
And so the game that I've picked for the classic game of the week is Donkey Kong 3.

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:00.520
That's right.

01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:03.940
Not the original, but Donkey Kong 3.

01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:12.220
This is the one that takes place in a gardening type of setup, or a greenhouse, if you will.

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:18.380
Whereas in the first Donkey Kong game, you played as Mario, and you were kind of going

01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:21.700
against Donkey Kong, because Donkey Kong kidnapped Pauline.

01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:24.060
In the second game, the tables were turned, right?

01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:29.580
In Donkey Kong Jr., Mario was the bad guy, and you were Donkey Kong Jr. trying to save

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:30.580
Donkey Kong.

01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:35.840
Well, now in this third game, you take on the role of Stanley.

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:37.140
Who the fuck is Stanley?

01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:41.240
I don't know, because this is the only game Stanley ever appeared in, and Stanley's also

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:46.640
one of those characters that rarely gets acknowledged by Nintendo after the fact.

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:52.960
And I don't know if it's the reason because this game didn't catch on, at least in America,

01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:55.480
as well as the other Donkey Kong games did, or what.

01:18:55.700 --> 01:19:01.420
But yeah, this game was released October of 1983 in Japan, and it followed shortly after

01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:04.260
in North America and Europe.

01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:08.540
And it's kind of blamed that it was not the commercial failure in North America, or excuse

01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:12.980
me, that it was a commercial failure in North America, because it came out right around

01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:16.580
the same time that the video game crash was happening.

01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:23.860
I'm actually not sure I really believe that, because I don't think in retrospect the arcade

01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:31.920
industry ever crashed as hard as the console industry did in 1983.

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:35.120
You know, arcades kind of made it through.

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:39.120
And granted, there might be other things that you kind of contribute to that.

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:44.880
However, I think the unique nature of Donkey Kong 3 and why it's a little weird could be

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:47.760
a symptom of the video game crash in 83.

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:53.000
And what I mean by that is, this really isn't like the other two Donkey Kong games.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.700
Now I'm highlighting it as a classic game of the week.

01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:58.580
I think it is an interesting game, but it is interesting in the ways that it is very

01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:01.180
much not like the other Donkey Kong games.

01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:04.980
Donkey Kong, the original, and Donkey Kong Jr. were kind of platformers, right?

01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:13.060
And a lot of the spiritual successors like Super Mario Brothers and Donkey Kong Country

01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:14.980
also platformers.

01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:17.700
Donkey Kong 3 looks like a platformer.

01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:18.700
It's not.

01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:21.800
As you're watching this on Twitch, can't you see?

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:23.680
This is a shooter.

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:27.780
And what you're doing is you're shooting the bugs and you're using the spray to shoot Donkey

01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:29.280
Kong up and off the screen.

01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:34.960
Now back to my point about why I think maybe Donkey Kong 3 in itself is a symptom of the

01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:42.280
video game crash is that I, and nowhere in the official wiki or any official resource

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:46.400
that I've read does it ever say that this is the case.

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:49.340
This is my own speculation, okay?

01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:54.040
I think that Donkey Kong 3 probably started off as a completely different game, a completely

01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:56.740
different type of property or idea.

01:20:56.740 --> 01:21:00.740
And then somewhere along the way, someone said, hey, why don't we put Donkey Kong's

01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:03.440
face on it and it'll sell plenty more.

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:06.440
It'll do much better if we just slap Donkey Kong into it.

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:09.300
Why do you have this character climbing up the vines that's the bad guy?

01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:10.300
We can have Donkey Kong.

01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:11.300
There you go.

01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:12.300
This is Donkey Kong 3.

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:13.300
Do it.

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:14.300
Print it.

01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:20.040
Print is very much, I think a symptom of what led the industry to crash in 83 was, uh, let's

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:24.080
just release a video game cause we can.

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:25.080
So I don't know.

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:28.840
And again, I have nothing to go off of or anything that indicates that is true.

01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:32.000
When you hear about the development of the game, you know, we know that the director

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.960
was actually Miyamoto was the director behind this game and that the legendary Gunpei Yokoi

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:39.620
was the producer behind this game.

01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:42.040
And the music was by Hirokazu Tanaka.

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:47.700
I mean, this was an all star Nintendo team that put this together, but I've known Nintendo

01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:53.020
to start something as one thing and then say, huh, maybe this should be something else.

01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:54.300
So I don't know.

01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:58.520
That's just, you know, again, my guess I'm taking a quick look over at our chat over

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:00.860
at twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:01.860
Yeah.

01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:05.900
Dark Tetsuya says, um, yeah, that seems like it would have happened that way.

01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:10.860
Uh, YYR says the later levels of DK3 feel real shmup like in the way that you need to

01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:12.120
dodge, weave and attack.

01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:13.120
Yeah.

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:16.240
Especially, and you're probably noticing as you watch on Twitch, the first couple levels

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:19.460
are pretty straightforward, but then it's when you get to that level where the middle

01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:23.220
platform is kind of like half missing and you can't just jump up and shoot them off

01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:25.240
the screen as fast as possible.

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:29.640
Um, you really, yeah, it becomes very much like a dodge and weave type of thing.

01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:32.640
Uh, Questbuster says it's like Galaga with platforms.

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:33.640
Heck yeah.

01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:38.180
And wouldn't this be a very Nintendo kind of way to respond to a game like Galaga and

01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:40.840
how successful it was again?

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:45.140
And a Phoenix 77, 26 says, that's just a theory, a Rob theory.

01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:46.140
Sure.

01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:48.540
I see what you did there, but call it what you want.

01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:49.940
But I think there's something to it.

01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:53.780
I think this may have started as like Nintendo's kind of answer to that.

01:22:53.780 --> 01:23:00.460
Uh, how, how cute would it be if it was bugs instead of spaceships?

01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:02.700
And that's our answer to Galaga.

01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:05.120
You know, it would be very similar, like Splatoon.

01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:09.500
What if we made a first person shooter, but it was paint instead of guns.

01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:10.500
Hmm.

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.920
Um, let's see.

01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:17.440
Uh, and then, uh, as Joe and Hunter Matt points out, turns out Stanley is a trophy in Melee

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:18.840
and a spirit in Ultimate.

01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:22.840
So, I mean, yeah, it hasn't been forgotten, but it does exist in this really weird place

01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:23.840
in Nintendo's history.

01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:30.880
And a lot of people, you know, you have to say Donkey Kong 3 before people go, oh yeah,

01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:32.400
that was the weird one.

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:37.160
So, now I remember, so since, you know, sometimes we have personal connections to these classic

01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:42.340
games of the week, I remember this because the grocery store of all places, talk about

01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:45.620
things that led to the crash and, you know, video games were everywhere.

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:49.440
The grocery store had a copy of Donkey Kong 3.

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:53.860
And I remember sinking quarters into the game because it is, it is a really good cabinet.

01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:56.500
And I love the old Nintendo arcade hardware.

01:23:56.500 --> 01:24:01.140
Those joysticks and those buttons really have a way of snapping and clicking in a way that

01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:02.620
not all the old machines do.

01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:07.100
So Donkey Kong 3 was really fun to play on those old machines.

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:11.960
If you want to play Donkey Kong 3, there are other ways that you can check this game out.

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:13.960
I believe it went onto Virtual Console.

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:19.960
Yeah, it was on the Wii Virtual Console, 3DS Virtual Console, and Wii U Virtual Console.

01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:24.140
Those are all available on the Wii, you know, those various systems.

01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:31.080
It is not part of the Switch Online library, but it is one of the releases that Hamsters

01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:32.760
Arcade Archives did.

01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:37.080
So you know how there's like a limited selection of Nintendo games in the Arcade Archives versus

01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:41.180
Super Mario Brothers being the most notable and the one that sold the most on the Switch

01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:43.060
and still is in the best seller list.

01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:45.340
Donkey Kong 3 is actually there as well.

01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:48.380
So if you're willing to pay, you know, seven, eight bucks, whatever they're charging for

01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:51.380
those games, you can check out Donkey Kong 3.

01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:56.020
You know, and it's worth a look if you've never played it, but you know, it is a classic

01:24:56.020 --> 01:24:57.340
80s arcade game.

01:24:57.340 --> 01:24:59.180
It was a very simple loop.

01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:03.540
So make sure you're going in with the appropriate expectations.

01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:06.300
There is some other interesting legacy to this game.

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:11.440
Since the game did do better in Japan, there was actually kind of a sequel-ish type of

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:17.400
thing developed by Hudson Soft called Donkey Kong 3 The Great Counterattack.

01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:24.240
It was available on the NEC PC-8801, 6601, Sharp X1, and FM7.

01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:27.620
In other words, none, nothing that you could get here in the States.

01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:30.640
So these were all Japanese only things.

01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:37.340
And honestly, I've seen videos of this game, and I'm going to be honest with you, it doesn't

01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:38.340
hold up well.

01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:39.880
It doesn't look good at all.

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:46.340
Those systems used kind of like a CGA style graphics, meaning the only colors were...

01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:48.020
It's not the cyan, magenta.

01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:49.020
It's the other one.

01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:53.660
I think it's yellow, red, black, green.

01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:56.140
I think we're the only colors on those.

01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:57.140
That's right.

01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:01.200
You see it on the gameplay, and it doesn't look good.

01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:04.680
You still are trying to shoot Donkey Kong up the screen, but it's like you have these

01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:06.640
weird backgrounds.

01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:11.120
It kind of looks like Bomberman with these weird ass backgrounds that have nothing to

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:14.960
do with the game, and there's no platforms anymore.

01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:16.200
And so it's weird.

01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:21.140
I don't particularly like it, but you can check it out and decide for yourself.

01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:23.920
It is an interesting part of gaming's history, I will say that.

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:26.800
There was also a Game & Watch that was available for it.

01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:32.380
I'm not sure to what extent you really saw these out here in the U.S., but it was included

01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:38.480
in the Game & Watch Gallery 4 for the Game Boy Advance, but get this, they replaced Stanley

01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:41.140
with Mario in that version.

01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:43.180
Isn't that interesting?

01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:45.940
This Stanley erasure, I hate it.

01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:48.760
And then instead of the bees, you got fireballs.

01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:53.420
So they really tried to Mario-fy the Game & Watch version, which is really interesting.

01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:55.900
So anyway, pour one out for Stanley.

01:26:55.900 --> 01:27:01.180
I think the long-lost Nintendo icon, although I guess there is some shout-outs in the Smash

01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:05.640
games where you would expect to see them, but it is interesting, Stanley never did come

01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:06.640
back.

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:07.640
He was never heard from again.

01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:10.600
So there you go.

01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:13.100
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, I did get Donkey Kong 1.

01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:14.100
It's definitely worth it.

01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:16.760
It has online leaderboards if you want to try for a high score.

01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:19.000
Talking about the arcade archives.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.060
Dark Tetsuya also says, I played a little bit of the PC port.

01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:24.060
It was interesting.

01:27:24.060 --> 01:27:26.840
That's a nice word to use, Dark Tetsuya.

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:29.740
And some folks in chat are making the joke about the Stanley parable.

01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:33.200
Yes, I see what you guys are doing there.

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:36.740
And YYR says, they just Mario-fied the ball game in the new Game & Watch.

01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:37.740
Yep, yep.

01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:40.220
Put Mario in everything, that's for sure.

01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:41.220
Let's see.

01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:46.460
And SSJ100Matt with an interesting fact saying, apparently the same guy who holds the world

01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:50.220
record for Donkey Kong holds the world record for Donkey Kong 3.

01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:51.220
Robbie Lakeman.

01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:52.220
Well, how about that?

01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:53.220
Congratulations.

01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:58.620
And that's actually especially interesting because they're not similar games, you guys.

01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:00.740
Donkey Kong 3, I almost said Dark Tetsuya 3.

01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:02.380
I just made you a video game.

01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:06.400
Donkey Kong 3, again, is a shooter.

01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:07.980
It's not really like a platformer.

01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:10.580
So it's very interesting that the same guy holds both records.

01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:16.900
But go back to some of those 80s icon, you know, people that were in magazines and stuff

01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:18.420
for having all the awards.

01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:21.660
You know, love them or hate them or don't give a shit about them.

01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:25.460
Billy Mitchell had a lot more awards than just Donkey Kong.

01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:27.980
He had the high score in probably some games you never heard of, too.

01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:31.940
So sometimes those games kind of cross over.

01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:35.700
Anyway, before I wrap this segment, Loki, did you ever play Donkey Kong 3 by chance?

01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:36.700
I'm just curious.

01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:37.700
I have not.

01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:38.700
Really?

01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:39.700
Had you ever heard of it or seen it before?

01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:40.700
I have, yeah.

01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:41.700
Okay, yeah.

01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:42.700
I just have never played it.

01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:45.980
Yeah, it's, I don't know, it's kind of one of those things where it's like, I think it's

01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:50.300
an important part of gaming's history because it's like a forgotten game in a legendary

01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:51.300
series.

01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:52.940
That's why I picked it.

01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:58.660
Didn't they have, was Donkey Kong 3, they didn't have like a, there wasn't like an NES

01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:00.140
version of that, right?

01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:05.900
I'm trying to remember and even though it really looks like it's on that same hardware

01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:09.780
as the classic NES, I actually, I feel like there was.

01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:10.780
Can you guys?

01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:13.580
Because I can't remember if there was like- Can you live folks fact check me?

01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:14.580
Animal Crossing.

01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:18.140
You remember the original Animal Crossing with the NES games?

01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:22.980
That may have been the only time that I would have actually been able to play that.

01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:27.460
I feel like there was an NES cartridge, I mean, this game is very clearly, look at the

01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:31.780
font, look at the look of the game, it's very clearly running on that same hardware that

01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:33.580
powered those early NES games.

01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:34.580
Yeah, they got an NES version.

01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:35.580
Okay, thank you.

01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:39.780
I was going to say, it had to exist somewhere.

01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:42.380
But again, was it released in America?

01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:43.500
That would be my other question.

01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:45.060
Or was it a Famicom only game?

01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:51.820
It's a Famicom and NES, but North America was 1983 and Japan was October 1983, so probably

01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:52.820
around the same time.

01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:53.820
Probably around the same time.

01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:54.820
All right, that's good to know.

01:29:54.820 --> 01:29:57.860
TigerKhan Chat says, this is a game that's deserving of a reboot.

01:29:57.860 --> 01:30:02.740
I don't know if I would go that far, but I don't think it needs to be super ignored and

01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:07.300
replaced with Mario in some of the ways that Nintendo has done.

01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:09.740
Like, let it be what it is, you know?

01:30:09.740 --> 01:30:16.140
So I would like to see Nintendo, why not put this game on the Nintendo library, Switch

01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:17.820
Online library?

01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:19.100
Why not?

01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:20.100
So I don't know.

01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:22.620
Or maybe there's something about it that Nintendo cares not to remember.

01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:25.500
Maybe because it wasn't so successful in the US, I don't know.

01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:27.900
But I remember this game fondly.

01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:30.060
An anniversary for Donkey Kong or something like that.

01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:31.060
The year of Donkey Kong.

01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:32.060
The year of Donkey Kong.

01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:33.060
There you go.

01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:34.060
That might be when we see it again.

01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:39.580
All right, there it is, once again, a classic game of the week, Donkey Kong 3.

01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:41.060
So yeah.

01:30:41.060 --> 01:30:42.660
And it's surprising I never picked that before.

01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:46.820
I think I had it ready to go another week, and then we flipped it out as last minute

01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:47.820
for something else.

01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:50.140
Because I was like, I thought I'd picked that before.

01:30:50.140 --> 01:30:51.140
But there it is.

01:30:51.140 --> 01:30:52.620
I think I had the video pulled and everything.

01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:53.620
But there it is.

01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:54.620
We're doing it tonight.

01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:55.620
Donkey Kong 3.

01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:56.620
All right.

01:30:56.620 --> 01:30:58.140
Let's get into some rapid fire news, shall we?

01:30:58.140 --> 01:31:01.540
A lot of other stuff going on in the gaming industry, right, Logie?

01:31:01.540 --> 01:31:02.540
Yep.

01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:09.300
So starting off with the games of gold for December, we've got looks like Raven Remastered

01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:10.540
and Bleed 2.

01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:14.720
Those are going to be our Xbox One games for the month.

01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:20.180
And then the Xbox 360 compatible game, we have Saints Row Get Out of Hell.

01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:24.100
And that's going to be available as well in December.

01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:30.700
And then on the PlayStation side of the house, we have Worms Rumble and Just Cause 4.

01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:35.080
Worms Rumble is going to be available on the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.

01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:37.420
Just Cause 4 is just PlayStation 4.

01:31:37.420 --> 01:31:39.900
At least that's the PlayStation 4 version.

01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:44.860
And then, of course, as mentioned before, they're going to have Rocket Arena is going

01:31:44.860 --> 01:31:50.500
to be available as your kind of premium PlayStation 5 game that's going to be free.

01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:54.560
And so that'll be available as well.

01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:58.620
And then we've got some fun glitches now.

01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:05.100
So this kind of harkens back for me to Grand Theft Auto 4 and the evil swing set that they

01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:08.820
used to have in there where you would be able to fling yourself into the air.

01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:11.660
Didn't you have a video like spotlighting some of these bugs?

01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:12.660
I do have a video.

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:13.660
It's on our channel actually.

01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:14.660
Is it really?

01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:15.660
Yeah.

01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:17.300
I think it's on the Orange Lounge.

01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:21.420
The long forgotten Orange Lounge Radio YouTube page.

01:32:21.420 --> 01:32:23.940
Do you know I was looking at it randomly the other day.

01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:28.660
There's still a video on there of you getting drunk playing Mario Kart at the arcade.

01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:29.960
It was your bachelor party.

01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:30.960
You remember that night?

01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:31.960
Yeah.

01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:32.960
And we filmed it?

01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:34.960
I'm going to remove that.

01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:38.840
That's the most viewed video, Loki.

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:40.840
Like 12,000 views.

01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:41.840
Wow.

01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:43.800
Something like that.

01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:44.800
It's pretty.

01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:45.800
It's up there.

01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:46.800
All right.

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:53.880
Well, so now in Red Dead Online, they have a bridge that is going to allow you to fling

01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:55.520
yourself as well.

01:32:55.520 --> 01:33:01.680
So this new bridge currently is near McFarland's Ranch.

01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:07.720
And if you throw a projectile weapon into one of the first few slats of the bridge,

01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:14.020
it causes the collision just to go crazy and just fling around everywhere, launching yourself

01:33:14.020 --> 01:33:17.660
into the air in a pretty hilarious fashion.

01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:20.080
So of course they have different videos online.

01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:25.060
So definitely go check it out if you play Red Dead Online because they could patch it

01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:28.240
out or maybe they won't because they never did with Grand Theft Auto IV.

01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:30.480
They just left it in there because it's something silly.

01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:33.040
It doesn't really necessarily break the game.

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:34.560
It's just kind of a fun thing to do.

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:39.480
So yeah, it's pretty cool to see something like that come back.

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:43.800
What do you think about that whole Red Dead Online sold separately thing that was recent

01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:46.100
news?

01:33:46.100 --> 01:33:48.760
They selling it separately or are they just putting it out for free?

01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:51.000
I thought it was like a $5 thing.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.760
Oh, that's not that bad.

01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:58.960
Red Dead Online, I guess that's fine.

01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:01.480
I don't know if there's a lot of people playing Red Dead Online.

01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:05.800
I would think Grand Theft Auto Online would be something they more interested in selling

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:09.360
separately.

01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:14.960
But I mean, that's where they're making most their money is online now with all the microtransactions.

01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:17.880
I just don't think Red Dead Online makes as much money as Grand Theft Auto.

01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:19.760
Grand Theft Auto has made them a ton of money.

01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:22.440
I mean, that's why it's been going for so long.

01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:25.920
Was that your cat that just screamed in the background or was that one of your kids?

01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:27.200
Oh yeah, it's always a catch.

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:28.200
No, it's always the cat.

01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:33.800
She was in here a second ago screaming because she didn't have more treats or something.

01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:35.040
It's like about once an hour.

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:37.560
So yeah, that was a cat.

01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:43.400
We finally found treats that Mr. Smoosh likes, by the way, because, you know, there's a story

01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:45.240
with our cat, Mr. Smoosh.

01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:48.960
He does not like traditional dry kitty treats that you like throw on the ground because

01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:51.640
we had a ton of them left over from when Sanrio passed.

01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:52.960
We tried to see if Smoosh would be into it.

01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:54.080
Nope, he didn't like it.

01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:56.520
But we finally found, I should say, Alan really found it.

01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:58.760
He will eat the shit out of those.

01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:01.040
There's wet kitty treats.

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:02.600
So we call him Licky Licky.

01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:04.880
So we go lick lick Licky Licky.

01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:08.560
And it's like this little thing you put pour out of a like little plastic thing.

01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:10.680
It's like it's like tuna and gravy or something.

01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:12.760
I don't know, some type of interesting little treat.

01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:13.800
But he'll he'll get there.

01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:17.200
He'll sit right there and go.

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:18.200
He's starting to lick it up.

01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:19.460
It's really cute.

01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:20.460
So yeah.

01:35:20.460 --> 01:35:21.460
Yeah.

01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:24.560
As John Hunter Matt says, Mr. Smoosh only accepts gold plated treats.

01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:31.840
You would think so because he only will eat food from the like hoity toity pet food store.

01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:34.720
We can't shop for him at PetSmart or Petco.

01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:39.180
We have to go to like the natural pet store, you know, in that in that part of town.

01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:41.160
And that's where these treats came from as well.

01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:43.160
So anyway.

01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:44.160
All right.

01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:45.160
Moving on.

01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:46.660
Sorry, this wasn't supposed to be the cat hour.

01:35:46.660 --> 01:35:47.660
But you know what?

01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:49.780
It's been a slower Newsweek.

01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:52.820
I say that and then I'm about to really drop a big piece of news.

01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:57.280
This is a pretty big deal actually, here in rapid fire news.

01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:00.620
Do you remember the game Saga Frontier on the PlayStation?

01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:01.620
Yes.

01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:05.700
Big, big Square Enix title again, I think Dark Soccer spotlighted this as a classic

01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:09.540
game not that long ago, because I have to be honest, I didn't care for this game when

01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:10.540
I first played it.

01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:13.140
I bought it and I didn't care for it.

01:36:13.140 --> 01:36:16.820
But well, we're gonna get a chance to give it a second opinion because Saga Frontier

01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:18.860
remastered is coming out.

01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:23.700
And again, I don't please do not send hate mail to the show because I said what I said

01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:25.380
about Saga Frontier.

01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:29.380
You know, you know what else I didn't like the first time I played it was Mass Effect.

01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:31.860
And then I gave it a second chance and I fell in love with it.

01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:36.080
So maybe a remaster will be a good chance for me to give a game a second chance.

01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:39.980
Maybe I just was you know, it was a long time ago that I checked it out on PlayStation.

01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:42.980
I'm kind of in a different place with gaming now than I was then.

01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:48.000
So it is but a lot of people remember this game very fondly back from 1997.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.440
So people very excited about this remaster and then it gives people like me a chance

01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:54.680
to check it out all over again.

01:36:54.680 --> 01:37:01.760
So it's coming out next summer for Switch, PlayStation 4, Steam, iOS and Android.

01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:06.740
That part has me a little concerned because I'm only a little worried that maybe like

01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:13.460
you remember the Final Fantasy like six that they did for iOS and Android.

01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:17.680
It's not great and not the way I would prefer to play those games even though they did give

01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:19.120
it all new art and everything.

01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:24.400
And now that I'm looking at some of what I see here in Soccer Frontier Remastered, I

01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:27.640
think it could be a product of the same formula.

01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:31.120
So just be what buyer beware.

01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:32.160
Wait for the reviews.

01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:33.160
Wait for the reviews.

01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:34.160
Yeah.

01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:35.680
But you know what?

01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:36.680
Maybe they've heard some of the feedback.

01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:38.480
Maybe they're gonna make changes.

01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:41.640
We shouldn't hold the prior games completely against it.

01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:46.000
But I'm just gonna say these are some things that make me a little bit tepidly optimistic

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000
about it.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.000
We'll see.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:53.680
But I mean, the videos in the trailer do look very interesting.

01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:57.340
There's supposed to be new cut scenes and events and a new protagonist even.

01:37:57.340 --> 01:38:00.620
So that's kind of something different is that they're actually adding to the story a little

01:38:00.620 --> 01:38:01.620
bit.

01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:03.200
So that could be very cool.

01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:07.800
So check that out when it releases, although we don't have an exact date just yet.

01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:09.640
All right.

01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:14.900
Moving on, one more story for you, which has to do with AOC or Representative Alexandria

01:38:14.900 --> 01:38:15.900
Ocasio-Cortez.

01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:21.300
Now, I'm not gonna report every time she goes live on Twitch, but it is notable to

01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:23.460
point out she did go live on Twitch again.

01:38:23.460 --> 01:38:27.860
And part of the reason I am bringing it up and we talked about it the first time is because

01:38:27.860 --> 01:38:34.720
it is interesting to see more and more politicians start to embrace Twitch as a platform.

01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:39.380
And what's particularly notable about this last stream that she did, it didn't get quite

01:38:39.380 --> 01:38:40.460
as many viewers.

01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:42.680
I don't think it had the hype going into it.

01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:45.600
And we're also now post-election as opposed to pre-election, which is probably a big part

01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:46.600
of it.

01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:50.960
But it's still, I mean, when I looked at it, it was like 80, 90,000 viewers.

01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:52.480
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:58.320
And that's still, you know, the size of two football stadiums worth of people.

01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:05.360
But what is notable about this is that she actually had playing among us with her Jagmeet

01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:09.440
Singh, the leader of Canada's new Democratic Party.

01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:14.960
So this was kind of in collaboration with a notable Canadian political figure.

01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:20.880
So it's an interesting kind of crossing boundaries there and now bringing a Canadian figure into

01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:21.880
this.

01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:26.580
So, like I said, what AOC is doing, other people are noticing, and that isn't just unique

01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:28.800
to the US.

01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:31.040
So pretty cool.

01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:32.320
That all happened the other day.

01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:34.440
It still had a pretty high amount of viewers.

01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:36.320
I did not catch the whole thing.

01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:39.600
I don't know if you guys in chat saw it and have anything to say about it.

01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:43.440
Oh, Black and Pat points out they raised $200K for charity.

01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:44.440
Pretty cool.

01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:48.320
ActDef says we need Bernie playing among us.

01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:49.320
You never know.

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:52.600
Bernie did have a Twitch channel, as did Donald Trump.

01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:56.800
But in both those cases, which are obviously two very polar opposite sides of the political

01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:06.920
spectrum, it was mostly redistribution of other stuff like a televised rally or a televised

01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:10.160
interview was also being delivered on Twitch.

01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:16.840
What makes what AOC is doing unique and different is that AOC is making Twitch content for Twitch

01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:18.080
on Twitch.

01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:23.640
So that's where she's kind of breaking boundaries there and bringing other people along for

01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:24.640
the ride.

01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:27.560
We had Representative Ilhan Omar the first time.

01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:30.520
Now we have Jagmeet Singh from Canada.

01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:36.520
And who knows who might come play among us, or maybe she'll play another game in the future.

01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:38.880
What game do you want to see AOC play next?

01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:40.480
That's what I want to know in chat.

01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:41.480
What game do you want to see?

01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:45.160
Civilization would be a good one, like Civ 6.

01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:48.520
That might be a fun one, right?

01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:51.000
I'd be very curious to see that.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.000
So yeah, Black and Pat saying they raised over $200K for charity.

01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:55.440
That's very cool.

01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:56.440
Let's see.

01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:59.640
I'm trying to see the other comments here.

01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:03.000
A lot of the other comments on SAGA Frontier.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.840
Act Deft picking another Twitch all-star game right now.

01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:08.800
Phasmophobia with AOC.

01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:10.040
That might work.

01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:11.800
Tigerclaw says Mortal Kombat 11.

01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:13.520
I don't know about that.

01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:16.400
Akuma JP says RE7.

01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:20.320
I don't know if AOC would be down for the jump scare games, but it would be entertaining.

01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:23.480
SSG100Matt says Justin Trudeau is a gamer.

01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:24.480
Get him.

01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:25.480
You never know.

01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:26.480
You never know.

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:27.480
How about Minecraft?

01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:28.480
Would you watch Minecraft with AOC?

01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:29.480
That could be interesting too.

01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:30.480
Sure.

01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:31.480
Sure.

01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:32.480
Why not?

01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:33.480
All right.

01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:34.480
Or somebody teaching her about a game.

01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:38.000
You know, kind of like Conan, but not necessarily funny or for comedy.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.000
I don't know.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.000
It'd be interesting.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.000
All right.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.560
I don't know what else she plays, but I'm sure there's something.

01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:44.560
All right.

01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:45.560
Anyhow.

01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:46.560
She plays League of Legends, I think.

01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:47.560
Oh, does she?

01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:48.560
Why does she stream some of that?

01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:49.560
That'd be interesting.

01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:55.800
Oh, there's a great suggestion from Akdeft, Jackbox Party Pack with AOC.

01:41:55.800 --> 01:42:01.560
That is a great idea, except she would definitely want to have a controlled environment for

01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:06.440
that, meaning only select Twitch people, kind of like how she's picking her people to play

01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:07.580
Among Us with.

01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:08.580
She hasn't posted her code.

01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:09.800
Let anybody join.

01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:14.440
I would not want to see that happen with Jackbox either because people, you know, people write

01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:16.920
some real obscene things in Jackbox, right?

01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:22.600
But if she can get a controlled game of 10 people and then maybe allow randos to join

01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:24.400
the audience, because all they would do is vote.

01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:29.000
They can't get in there and put things like, you know, fuck, fuck, fuck, or, you know,

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.840
all those other nasty things.

01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:33.840
Interesting.

01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:34.840
I'd be very I'd be very curious.

01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:36.400
Yeah, that might be a fun one.

01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:40.760
If it's a controlled environment where she knows who she's playing with and that everybody's

01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:44.560
going to keep it G rated because that's you know, she is a politician at the end of the

01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:46.200
end of the day.

01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:49.560
You know, maybe PG is about as far as you can go PG.

01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:50.560
Star Wars is rated PG.

01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:51.560
Right.

01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:52.560
So you can go about that far.

01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:53.560
All right.

01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:54.560
Anyway.

01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:56.240
Uh, let's move on.

01:42:56.240 --> 01:42:57.240
Interesting.

01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:01.300
Quest Buster says there's a clip floating out there of AOC saying how being patient

01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:04.720
in that game dealing with rage quitters helps her in Congress.

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:06.460
Well, she should.

01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:07.460
She should play that on stream.

01:43:07.460 --> 01:43:08.460
Then I'd be very curious.

01:43:08.460 --> 01:43:11.360
Akuma JP says, oh, a large to have an Among Us night.

01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:13.440
You know, we were talking about it and it's my fault.

01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:18.240
I didn't follow through on it, but soon I do want to still make that happen.

01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:19.240
Maybe just in time for the holidays.

01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:20.240
All right.

01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:23.920
In the meantime, let's travel around the world and check out some games you can play besides

01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:29.360
just Among Us with some release dates, even though it might be slowing down a little bit,

01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:30.360
but not, not really.

01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:32.680
Actually, I think I was looking at this week and no, there's still some big releases this

01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:33.680
week.

01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:34.680
Right?

01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:35.680
Yeah.

01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:36.680
It's still pretty busy actually.

01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:38.680
So, uh, let me run it down.

01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:39.680
Yep.

01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:43.360
So, uh, they front load everything in December because you know, holidays.

01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:44.360
Sure.

01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:49.560
Um, Kronos before the shadow or before the ashes on PC, Nintendo switch PlayStation four,

01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:56.380
Xbox one stadia, empire of sin on PC, Mac, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox

01:43:56.380 --> 01:43:57.480
one.

01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:05.480
We have frost point VR proving grounds on all of your VR platforms, uh, rip the index

01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:06.480
in Vive.

01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:13.400
Uh, we've got Tom Clancy's rainbow six siege on PlayStation five and Xbox series X, uh,

01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:20.880
twin mirror on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one worms rumble on PC, PlayStation four and

01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:21.880
PlayStation five.

01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:24.920
I remember that one is free for PlayStation owners.

01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:31.640
If you have PlayStation plus, um, salmon max save the world remastered on PC and Nintendo

01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:37.600
switch, uh, Sharon, the wanderer, the tower of fortune and the dice of fate on PC and

01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:38.600
intend to switch.

01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:39.600
That's a mouthful.

01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:40.600
Yes.

01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:44.600
Absolute drift on Nintendo switch.

01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:52.480
That's ironic for Nintendo switch, um, uh, layer Risa two on a loss legends and the secret

01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:58.840

fire emblem, a shadow dragon, and the blade of light on into the switch.

01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:52.240
Dan, this is a busy week.

01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:53.240
Exactly.

01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:59.040
Fitness boxing to rhythm and exercise and intend to switch John wick hex on and tend

01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:06.360

to Nuki sunset on PC.

01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:11.680
And I believe that is it.

01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:12.680
That's enough.

01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:13.680
All right.

01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:16.400
Actually, Japan, uh, looking at the release dates, they're pretty similar.

01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:21.040
There's quite a lot happening this week, uh, empire of sin from Sega releases on December

01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:24.840
the first I'm assuming that's kind of dated to match with the rest of the world.

01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:28.520
But then when you get to December 3rd, um, you get a lot of, a lot of similar stuff to

01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:29.800
what Loki was just talking about.

01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:34.960
Although the Japanese versions, uh, most notably on the switch, uh, at layer Risa to lost legends

01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:39.000
in the secret ferry, which I think Loki mentioned for the U S as well, uh, sheer in the wander,

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.780
the tower of fortune and the dice of fate.

01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:45.640
That same one is also out in Japan this week, uh, immortals, Phoenix rising, uh, Sumiko

01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:47.520
Gurashi, uh, Oh, yeah.

01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:54.000
No Sumi day tabby Kaibun sugo Roku, uh, comes out this week, uh, as well as immortals.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.000
I'm sorry.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.000
I just said that one.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.360
Uh, there's some type of remothered double pack is out this week together.

01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:04.800
The battle cats gets a price reduction and a game called Derby stallion is released as

01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:05.800
well.

01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:07.040
And, uh, Oh, I'm sorry.

01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:08.040
Those are for another.

01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:10.220
Those are some other dates that snuck in here.

01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:15.740
Let me look real quick at PlayStation four and five to see what is out in Japan.

01:47:15.740 --> 01:47:20.680
Um, immortals rising on, on PlayStation five this week on Japan.

01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:22.500
So there's a new PS five game this week.

01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:24.380
That's pretty exciting.

01:47:24.380 --> 01:47:28.420
And looking at the PlayStation four, a lot of the same stuff I read for switch, um, mortals

01:47:28.420 --> 01:47:32.260
Phoenix rising the at layer Risa to, uh, this one's different.

01:47:32.260 --> 01:47:39.580
And then, uh, go by train hash hash hero Yamanote Linae comes out, uh, from square Enix actually.

01:47:39.580 --> 01:47:45.540
Uh, and then, uh, that same double pack, Ooh, as well as the dark pictures, little hope

01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:47.820
comes out on the PlayStation four this week.

01:47:47.820 --> 01:47:49.820
I'm looking up that go by train.

01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:51.640
It's a PlayStation VR game.

01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:52.640
That is like a train.

01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:55.700
It's a train driving game, but in VR, that's pretty cool.

01:47:55.700 --> 01:47:56.700
Hmm.

01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:58.080
That was neat.

01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:00.220
I wish we got more of those types of games here.

01:48:00.220 --> 01:48:02.840
Once in a while though, they'll localize and they sneak through, but most of those

01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:04.980
train games kind of skip us by.

01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:09.180
So all right, there you go for Japanese releases, uh, with dark soccer and not here tonight,

01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:12.340
maybe Loki can step in and, uh, talk about the UK releases.

01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:13.340
Yeah.

01:48:13.340 --> 01:48:21.820
So we have Kronos before the ashes on a PlayStation four looks like Xbox one, Nintendo switch

01:48:21.820 --> 01:48:22.820
and PC.

01:48:22.820 --> 01:48:29.820
Uh, definitely cry five special edition on PlayStation born Xbox one monster truck championship

01:48:29.820 --> 01:48:32.220

01:48:32.220 --> 01:48:39.140
We've got empire of sin on PlayStation four, Xbox one and into the switch Taika no taxes

01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:46.820
in rhythmic adventure two on Nintendo switch and also rhythmic adventure.

Uh, we've got Madden 21.

01:49:08.420 --> 01:49:14.500
Looks like coming out in PlayStation five and Xbox series X FIFA 21 on PlayStation five

01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:23.380
and Xbox series X Anima arcane edition on PlayStation four dragon adventure on looks

01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:34.300

four pinstripe on intend to switch.

01:50:42.620 --> 01:50:43.620
And that's it.

01:50:43.620 --> 01:50:44.620
All right.

01:50:44.620 --> 01:50:50.520
Busy week, uh, not usual that the week after Thanksgiving is so busy, but probably a lot

01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:54.560
of small delays this year because the pandemic and so forth and, and things are in a weird

01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:56.880
place right now because of everything going on in 2020.

01:50:56.880 --> 01:51:01.260
So, um, but I'm sure it's going to start to dry up the next couple of weeks as we start

01:51:01.260 --> 01:51:06.280
to get to Christmas because in Hanukkah, yeah, it's going to start to slow down.

01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:07.280
All right.

01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:08.280
Anyhow.

01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:12.560
Um, we are going to do some more news stories here and then we will get to your questions

01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:17.200
and comments in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:21.640
Let's go to Loki with our next story.

01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:25.140
So this is kind of what I'm hoping with my work too, is that they're going to allow us

01:51:25.140 --> 01:51:27.520
to start working from home permanently.

01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:33.940
Um, but one gaming company has done that as well, or I should probably one new game company

01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:37.060
has been allowing their employees to do that.

01:51:37.060 --> 01:51:40.200
So Square Enix says they're going to allow most of their employees to work from home

01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:45.420
permanently in the new policy goes into effect starting in December, uh, provided that their

01:51:45.420 --> 01:51:46.660
positions allow for it.

01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:51.300
And they have the flexibility to change their designation month to month or on a month to

01:51:51.300 --> 01:51:52.300
month basis.

01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:56.060
But they said that they're expecting that 80% of their employees will end up working

01:51:56.060 --> 01:52:01.240
from home, uh, once the program starts, um, well next week, actually.

01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:07.380
So, um, I mean, definitely with this type of environment, you know, with the pandemic

01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:12.980
and everything, um, it is nice to see that companies are able to have their employees

01:52:12.980 --> 01:52:17.220
work remotely, as long as they're able to strike a nice work-life balance, that would

01:52:17.220 --> 01:52:18.700
be important.

01:52:18.700 --> 01:52:24.780
Um, I'm totally for working from home, I love not having to drive in.

01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:25.780
It's great.

01:52:25.780 --> 01:52:30.580
I think when we talk about that new normal post COVID, you know, I don't think necessarily

01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:31.820
all the news is bad.

01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:35.380
One of those things is that, you know, yeah, like work from home, I think you're going

01:52:35.380 --> 01:52:36.620
to see more often.

01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:39.760
And it's interesting to me with Square Enix in particular, because, you know, with Final

01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:44.760
Fantasy XIV, which I play a lot, um, the, the pandemic and the adjustment to the work

01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:49.240
at home situation was kind of cited as it was a little rough to get going.

01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:52.520
And that's why they ended up delaying some content for a few months.

01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:56.680
Um, they're back on track now and they're moving, you know, at a, at a, they just had

01:52:56.680 --> 01:53:01.200
another live letter this past week for their big, big patch, uh, the Tuesday after this

01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:04.200
upcoming one, December 8th, they're doing a big, big content patch.

01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:07.240
And it sounds like they're going to release their next, or excuse me, they're going to

01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:12.800
tease their next expansion in February, which is about four months off cycle from when they

01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:16.280
would have done it normally October, but everything in, in Final Fantasy XIV land kind of got

01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:17.520
bumped back four months.

01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:21.680
So even though there was a huge adjustment period, it seems like they're kind of used

01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:22.760
to it now.

01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:26.080
So it's interesting to think that, you know, Square Enix, that would include Final Fantasy

01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:29.240
XIV, a lot of that development is going to happen from home now.

01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:31.400
So it's neat.

01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:32.440
It's just, it's different.

01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:36.840
It's another way to kind of, you know, but if you think about it, a lot of indie developers

01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:38.760
have worked from home for a long, long time.

01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:39.480
Right.

01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:44.120
So yeah, so games, games can certainly be made from the comfort of your own home.

01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:46.400
And I'm sure a lot of people are wondering about their own jobs.

01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:51.080
Loki mentioned that too, as Joe and Matt and Chad is saying, I hope, I hope we're able to stay

01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:52.040
remote.

01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:55.040
I know they're going to be, you know, some changes are coming to my job as well, where it's

01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:59.520
going to be kind of like havesies, you know, like some days we'll need to be in the office for

01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:01.560
things, but some days we'll be able to work remote.

01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:04.160
And that sounds, that's a good balance for me, I think.

01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:07.120
So, yeah, it's going to be interesting to see what it looks like for people.

01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:09.680
There's going to be a lot more.

01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:12.800
I mean, of course there were people that were working from home before this.

01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:17.840
It wasn't a new concept, but now it's just going to be, I think many companies that didn't think

01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:22.240
they could had to, and now they've realized, oh, we can do this.

01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:24.800
And I think Square Enix is kind of one of those companies.

01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:29.680
So Akuma JP and Chad says security is the only bottleneck.

01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:31.120
That's a very interesting point.

01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:31.760
Yeah.

01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:35.360
You know, I used to work in the healthcare industry.

01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:40.400
And so I would be very curious about, you know, how they were able to make some of that privacy

01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:44.960
and security stuff work in the home situation because, you know, it's a very touchy area.

01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:45.200
Yeah.

01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:46.560
A lot of it's VPN.

01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:47.280
Yeah.

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:48.560
So, all right.

01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:51.680
Anyhow, let's move on to another story.

01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:58.080
And this one has to do with an actual historical marker, meaning it's one of those places where

01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:00.960
they like actually, they have a sign that marks.

01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:02.560
This is the place.

01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:04.960
And in this case, it is in New Hampshire.

01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:11.360
And it is a new sign that talks about BASIC, the first user-friendly computer programming

01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:11.920
language.

01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:17.040
BASIC is something near and dear to my heart because the Commodore 64, it was all powered

01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:17.520
by BASIC.

01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:21.680
I mean, they had machine language and assembly and stuff in there too, but BASIC was built

01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:22.000
in.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.960
You turned on the computer and you were in BASIC programming mode.

01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:30.720
BASIC, by the way, is short for Beginners All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code.

01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:31.600
How about that?

01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:35.200
It was invented at Dartmouth College in 1964.

01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:42.720
And there was actually a column that happened recently in the Concord Monitor where it was

01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:48.960
noted that there were 255 historical markers for bridges, historical figures, but there

01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:53.760
was nothing about New Hampshire's technical and scientific accomplishments.

01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:56.080
So, that's what happened.

01:55:56.080 --> 01:55:58.240
They actually got a historical marker for it.

01:55:58.240 --> 01:56:01.280
It is located on New Hampshire Route 120.

01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:05.520
It's not far from Dartmouth College and where BASIC, of course, was created.

01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:09.440
State historical markers are always on state highways.

01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:13.360
That's why it's not actually on the college itself, but that is pretty cool.

01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:16.560
And I hope it becomes a pokey stop, quite frankly.

01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:25.600
So, I can say from having reviewed plenty of things in the old Ingress OPR and now Niantic

01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:28.160
Wayfarer, I would absolutely accept that.

01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:30.160
As a point of interest, that sign.

01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:32.880
So, that thing better become a pokey stop.

01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:37.120
The only thing that would disqualify it is that if there's something real close to it,

01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:39.520
that's also a pokey stop already.

01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:42.560
But in the picture, it looks like there's nothing around it.

01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:47.120
So, I hope it does become a pokey stop and I want someone to send me a gift from there.

01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:47.840
Thank you, thank you.

01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:49.040
All right.

01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:52.000
SG100 Matt says, it's Dartmouth College.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:52.960
It'll be a pokey stop.

01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:56.400
It's near on the state highway, but yes, it should be, hopefully.

01:56:58.160 --> 01:57:03.040
YYR says, Commodore 64 and 128 basic programmer here.

01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:04.720
I made a bunch of shitty math games.

01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:10.480
Hey, but shitty math games brought you shitty pixel games in the year 2020.

01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:14.640
Questbuster in chat says, 10, print.

01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:16.320
Hello, VOG network.

01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:20.160
Now then, all you need is 20, go to 10 and now run.

01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:23.280
Perfect.

01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:24.240
All right.

01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:30.800
Well, congratulations for the push to get that recognized and it actually worked.

01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:32.160
I think that's pretty cool.

01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:32.960
All right, moving on.

01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:34.000
Just a couple more stories.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:34.500
Loki.

01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:36.480
All right.

01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:42.960
So, Sony, of course, is touting that their console launch is the biggest console launch ever.

01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:49.360
And of course, they didn't really say what their sales figures were, but they basically saying

01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:55.360
that we wanted to confirm that PlayStation 5 is their biggest console launch ever and the

01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:56.720
demand is unprecedented.

01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:04.960
I remember seeing actually Black Friday there as folks camped out, waiting for new consoles

01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:09.600
and stuff, which is kind of crazy in this kind of environment, but that's where we're at.

01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:16.640
I mean, I guess scalpers and all sorts of problems with that stuff, but it's still apparently

01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:17.600
doing well.

01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:18.880
And I think both of them are doing well.

01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:23.760
But since no one's releasing figures, we don't really know how to compare.

01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:27.680
But once again, why do we need to know that as consumers?

01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:28.480
It doesn't matter.

01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:33.120
All it does is feed into the, ha, our team won and your team lost mentality.

01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:34.960
So, I get it as well.

01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:38.560
Yeah, and Bobby's confirming Microsoft said it was their biggest launch ever as well.

01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:40.320
And I remember hearing that in the last week.

01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:42.400
So, both consoles are doing very well.

01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:43.040
And actually, I will say...

01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:46.480
Who would have thought when everybody's forced to stay at home that home entertainment would

01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:47.520
be successful?

01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:53.360
Well, and I was more surprised by it being the biggest console launch ever more because

01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:57.920
I would have thought there were less of them out there because of the pandemic.

01:58:57.920 --> 01:59:02.800
So, I would have thought by nature PlayStation 4 did better because there were more of them

01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:03.440
when it launched.

01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:04.800
But I guess that's not really the case.

01:59:04.800 --> 01:59:08.640
That's just me kind of remembering it with rose colored glasses or whatever.

01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:13.520
I think there is something to be said about more people in general are playing games and

01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:19.360
more people want these sorts of devices in their homes because the folks that are getting

01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:24.240
older and are making the purchasing decisions in their household grew up with video games

01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:29.280
all around them, grew up on things like Mario and Donkey Kong 3, Stanley, and things like

01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:29.920
that.

01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:31.920
People kind of remember that.

01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:37.760
So, I kind of think just by nature, there are more gamers and so there's more people

01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:39.200
looking for PlayStation 5.

01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:44.240
But apparently PlayStation 5 and Xbox X are like the must have holiday gifts this year.

01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:48.720
So, they are the Cabbage Patch Kids of 2020.

01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:54.080
I don't know if there's an actual toy that's like that this year.

01:59:54.080 --> 01:59:57.760
I thought there was supposed to be something, but I'm just hearing about how people are

01:59:57.760 --> 01:59:58.320
going crazy.

01:59:59.120 --> 02:00:04.800
There was a story on the news here locally about people were camping out at the mall

02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:07.760
for PlayStation 5 when there were two of them available.

02:00:08.640 --> 02:00:09.120
Two of them.

02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:11.600
So, interesting.

02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:19.440
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says our local gaming bar is almost completely booked for kids parties

02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:24.640
from parents who aren't able to get an Xbox or PlayStation 5 for their kids by Christmas.

02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:29.680
Black Compat says I've given up on a PlayStation 5 until February.

02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:30.480
Yeah, me too.

02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:34.080
And I knew when I made the decision I was going to push for Xbox.

02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:37.280
I'll get it in 2021 and it'll be all right.

02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:39.200
There'll be more games available at that point.

02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:43.520
As long as I don't miss Final Fantasy 16, and I won't, we're good.

02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:49.520
Bobby Blackwolf says I predicted the animatronic baby Yoda toy would be a hot toy, but I don't

02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:50.480
think that happened.

02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:50.980
Interesting.

02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:56.560
But maybe it's because there's lots of baby Yoda toys out there, but there's only one

02:00:56.560 --> 02:00:57.280
PlayStation 5.

02:00:57.280 --> 02:00:58.800
There's only one Xbox Series X.

02:00:58.800 --> 02:00:59.120
I don't know.

02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:00.800
That's just speculation.

02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:01.920
So, anyway.

02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:06.480
Act F says I'm going to wait for the new consoles until next year.

02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:10.080
This year, I got a Samsung S20 and I've been loving the hell out of it.

02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:13.520
Playing Pokemon Go on 120 hertz is a godsend.

02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:14.480
Yeah, yeah.

02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:15.920
So, all right.

02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:18.240
Well, let's move on.

02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:20.480
One last story for you guys.

02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:22.240
And it has to do with Google Stadia.

02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:29.040
Google Stadia is promising 400 games in development, which, you know, sometimes Stadia gets criticized

02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:30.080
because they don't really have enough.

02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:34.560
So, Stadia wants to tell you more are coming.

02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:39.840
And these are coming from comments made in an interview with Mobile Syrup by the director

02:01:39.840 --> 02:01:45.360
of games for Google Stadia, meaning the actual, like, an actual, as opposed to people on Twitter

02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:49.200
that are, like, kind of not really affiliated with Google Stadia, but making comments.

02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:52.160
This person actually is with Google Stadia, director of games.

02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:55.840
These games are going to be launching over the next few years.

02:01:56.560 --> 02:01:58.560
Not necessarily all of them in 2021.

02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:03.680
In the interview saying my team is almost done with 2021.

02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:05.520
We're thinking about 2022 right now.

02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:06.640
That's our focus.

02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:10.320
2023 is really kind of where we're aiming our sights.

02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:12.400
So, Stadia sounds like it might be a slow burn.

02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:17.520
And hopefully, Google will continue to believe in it for that long.

02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:22.960
And, you know, again, as much as it sounds like I might be giving Stadia a hard time sometimes,

02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:26.800
I want Google to play the long game on this.

02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:33.760
And, you know, when we have by 2023, there probably will be more 5G.

02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:37.760
And so Comcast will be needled on that bandwidth cap.

02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:41.360
And I think there will be more of a space for things like Stadia.

02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:43.840
So I hope that they have the games to kind of back it up.

02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:45.360
It'll be very interesting.

02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:48.960
But Stadia still doesn't have the ability to just, oh, open up your laptop and play

02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:49.840
right in your browser.

02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:55.840
I still feel like that's something Stadia promised a year ago that they still need to

02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:58.000
really make it that easy.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:02:59.680
Not just for Pro, for everybody.

02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:01.520
Yes, I know you can do it in the browser on Pro.

02:03:02.160 --> 02:03:05.520
But I'm talking for everybody and 4K if you want it for everybody.

02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:13.600
So anyway, Google has added things like Doom Eternal, Borderlands 3, Hotline Miami,

02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:15.120
Cyberpunk is incoming.

02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:19.440
But, you know, the 100 games that are in there still somehow doesn't feel like enough.

02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:23.120
But Google does have some first party studios in Montreal and Los Angeles.

02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:26.080
Don't forget, they have some type of development deal with harmonix.

02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:28.320
Fuser wasn't it because that's everywhere.

02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:31.680
So there's another harmonix game that's in development that's going to be a Google

02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:32.880
Stadia thing.

02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:36.240
That as a music game fan, that might get me to suddenly perk up and pay attention.

02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:36.640
We'll see.

02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:42.160
Don't forget, they have talented folks like Phil Harrison, Jade Raymond, you know, they've

02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:45.680
so we're still waiting for those exclusive games.

02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:49.440
But I think the concern is, look, they can.

02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:52.720
The thing about Stadia is I don't have to buy one.

02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:58.320
So if Stadia suddenly gets that must have game tomorrow, it'll be pretty easy to go

02:03:58.320 --> 02:03:58.880
in there and get it.

02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:02.400
I'm not gonna have to worry about supply issues like we do on the PlayStation 5 or Xbox or

02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:03.040
whatever.

02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:05.360
Like that's the whole perk about Stadia.

02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:10.160
I think the worry that a lot of us have is Google will pull the plug if it's not successful

02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:11.360
by 2023.

02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:16.000
But if Google is committed to playing the long game, then maybe there will be some,

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:19.280
you know, we'll be looking back on these years having a laugh.

02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:21.040
Like, why didn't we see this coming sooner?

02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:29.040
I just think that their idea with Stadia is it's a good idea, just not for now.

02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:35.760
Like it's just like these games streaming services and stuff where it's just not the

02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:36.720
right time for that.

02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:42.240
Our infrastructure, maybe in other countries like Japan where we have like rock solid infrastructure

02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:44.960
for Internet and stuff and no bandwidth caps.

02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:50.960
It may be a great idea in the United States, not a great idea because we have bandwidth

02:04:50.960 --> 02:04:51.440
caps.

02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:56.880
Our Internet's not fast enough to really drive that, you know, gameplay and stuff.

02:04:56.880 --> 02:05:01.120
Whereas it yeah, in the future when our bandwidth caps are just like let's imagine unlimited

02:05:01.120 --> 02:05:03.840
in our internet speeds like a gigabit down or something like that.

02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:05.920
And we can basically stream whatever the hell we want.

02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:09.760
That's gonna be amazing because then we'll never have to upgrade our consoles.

02:05:09.760 --> 02:05:14.160
It's always just gonna be, you know, the most cutting edge everything.

02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:16.240
And that's the dream right there.

02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:19.840
But we're not living in that time period, unfortunately.

02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:23.600
And so I think that's where the struggle is gonna be is that one.

02:05:25.360 --> 02:05:27.440
I don't like the idea of having to buy my games.

02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:30.560
I think it should be like, you know, especially with a streaming console like that.

02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:34.720
I think it should just be a library they have access to and you pay a monthly fee or whatever,

02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:35.440
like games pass.

02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:41.200
But it's just too early and this is not the right environment for it.

02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:46.880
It's it's gonna be a hard sell when you're getting charged, you know, for going over

02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:48.320
your bandwidth and stuff like that.

02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:51.200
And so that's gonna be the struggle right now.

02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:55.840
I think, you know, five years from now when we maybe move past all that and our infrastructure

02:05:55.840 --> 02:05:58.320
is better, then maybe it might be the time.

02:05:58.320 --> 02:06:00.880
But by that time, this will probably be dead.

02:06:00.880 --> 02:06:02.800
It'll be the next thing that comes out.

02:06:03.520 --> 02:06:09.520
Phoenix7726 in chat with a very good point saying the worry is streaming only and this

02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:11.680
shit should not catch on long term.

02:06:11.680 --> 02:06:14.800
Archiving will even be more of a nightmare than it already is.

02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:16.160
That is true.

02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:18.240
And it's a completely valid point, Phoenix.

02:06:18.240 --> 02:06:23.520
I think the only issue is that this is kind of where the industry is going, whether we

02:06:23.520 --> 02:06:24.240
like it or not.

02:06:25.120 --> 02:06:29.360
You know, and it does also ask a question like, okay, so we've seen that the movie and

02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:32.080
the TV industry has kind of gone this way, right?

02:06:32.080 --> 02:06:34.320
But like, look at some of the stuff like Netflix.

02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:37.520
What if Netflix goes ass up tomorrow?

02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:40.880
Where are we going to be able to watch things like Stranger Things?

02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:48.080
Now, Netflix has done some limited DVD and Blu-ray type of releases, especially for their

02:06:48.080 --> 02:06:51.040
big shows like the one I just mentioned there, Stranger Things.

02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:54.160
You know, you can still get that on a more traditional DVD, Blu-ray.

02:06:54.160 --> 02:06:58.080
Same thing with things like Star Trek Discovery and people who haven't wanted to pony up for

02:06:58.080 --> 02:07:02.720
CBS All Access or whatever it's going to be called now, the Paramount, Paramount Premiere

02:07:02.720 --> 02:07:03.600
or whatever they're calling it.

02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:06.000
There's that.

02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:10.720
But I'm not so sure that is even going to be the future.

02:07:10.720 --> 02:07:12.320
That's more of a bridge.

02:07:12.320 --> 02:07:17.920
What you're starting to see happen now is you're starting to see more nuanced streaming

02:07:17.920 --> 02:07:21.440
services that offer some of the classic stuff.

02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:26.880
Like there are free TV streaming services that show really old reruns.

02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:30.960
You know, I'm not sure there's that streaming service yet where I can watch old episodes

02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:31.840
of Mama's Family.

02:07:32.480 --> 02:07:33.200
Maybe there is.

02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:35.760
Is it on Hulu maybe?

02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:40.080
It might be, but I think you're going to start to see more streaming services start to pick

02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:42.080
up on that archival type of stuff.

02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:48.160
And I think long term, gaming goes a similar direction.

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:53.760
In a way, you're starting to already see it with Antstream, which I know for whatever

02:07:53.760 --> 02:07:56.320
reason still hasn't really launched in the US yet.

02:07:56.320 --> 02:08:00.080
And their client is an on Xbox Series X, even though it's on Xbox One.

02:08:00.080 --> 02:08:02.400
It's one of those kind of few things that doesn't exist on both.

02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:07.440
But as somebody, you know, full disclosure, who backed the Kickstarter and got two years,

02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:14.000
even though I'm in the US, I'm able to use Antstream and that is like a classics streaming

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:14.880
service.

02:08:14.880 --> 02:08:20.240
So a lot of like, oh, I'm talking old ass fucking Spectrum games and Commodore 64 games

02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:21.680
you forgot about.

02:08:21.680 --> 02:08:22.720
They're on Antstream.

02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:25.680
And I do like that service.

02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:31.040
And I think there's going to be more like it that are going to archive some of these

02:08:31.040 --> 02:08:32.000
older things.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:36.080
There's always going to be some things that slip through the cracks, but just kind of

02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:39.680
I guess that's my very long winded answer to that statement.

02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:41.280
I'm not saying I like it.

02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:47.040
I still like having physical collectibles, but Netflix is going to still release things

02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:49.280
like Stranger Things and the must have stuff on Blu-ray.

02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:54.640
But I think our industry is moving that direction and we have to be prepared that there is going

02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:59.440
to be more and more that streaming once more of the bandwidth caps and some of these other

02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:01.200
limitations allow for it.

02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:03.520
That's that's where my head's at right now anyway.

02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:11.600
So Phoenix 7726 says if they do it in tandem, then I have less of an issue, but I want download

02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:15.760
still prominent and I want full physical media, not this half ass shit where we get or take

02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:16.640
the GOG solution.

02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:23.440
Phoenix 7726 says counterpoint physical media is far more prominent in movies and music

02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:25.760
has DRM free downloads.

02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:26.400
And that is true.

02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:30.560
And limited run games is still making NES cartridges that are selling.

02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:32.320
So there's always going to be a space for it.

02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:35.200
But I think an important thing with movies.

02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:39.920
This is a huge we don't know yet what's going to happen.

02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:45.680
But the huge question mark in the movie industry is what's going to happen after the pandemic?

02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:51.360
Once the back end that will have an idea in about a year because, you know, the vaccine

02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:53.040
is going to start to get out there.

02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:56.320
It will be safe to go to movie theaters again eventually.

02:09:56.320 --> 02:10:03.200
But the question is, will people do it or will the release of Wonder Woman 84 on HBO

02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:09.360
Max and Mulan on Disney Plus Plus, will that have proven to be more lucrative for the movie

02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:11.440
industry than a traditional movie house?

02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:15.440
I kind of hope not, because I still like going to the movies.

02:10:16.400 --> 02:10:21.360
But that's I, Loki, do you do you see that that that could be a real, like, scary thing

02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:25.360
for the movie industry is that are people even going to come back to the movie theater

02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:27.360
once they've been able to watch Wonder Woman at home?

02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:30.320
Yeah, I think people will will come back.

02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:30.820
Yeah.

02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:37.200
I well and I also come from a you know, you know, I have a long standing love love relationship

02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:40.960
with like cult movies and old movie screens.

02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:42.560
And I host Rocky Horror.

02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:45.120
I've hosted a cult screening of Scott Pilgrim.

02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:48.080
I was supposed to do clue the movie before the pandemic.

02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:50.480
And now it's scheduled next year at some point.

02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:55.040
And there's nothing like bringing a big group of people together to watch a bad movie.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:00.560
But it's it will movie will movie theaters become a novelty?

02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:02.240
Have they become too?

02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:05.520
Are there too damn many movie theaters to meet the demand?

02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:06.080
I don't know.

02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:10.560
These again, these are all questions we were going to find out the answer to in the coming

02:11:10.560 --> 02:11:11.060
years.

02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:12.320
So, yeah.

02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:12.480
Yeah.

02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:17.200
And Phoenix 7726 says also drive ins apparently did well during summer.

02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:19.200
So this could be a time for an interesting rebirth.

02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:19.840
Absolutely.

02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:24.080
They are always threatening to close that drive in theater here in Sacramento every

02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:24.560
fucking year.

02:11:24.560 --> 02:11:26.560
I hear a story they're going to do it anymore.

02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:28.000
I don't think they're going to do it anymore.

02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:30.720
I really don't this this year.

02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:35.360
If anybody made money, it was that that place because they were going to they were going

02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:36.240
to get there in years.

02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:39.280
I would say that they probably need to upgrade it, though.

02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:43.920
They were going to tear it down and replace it with a traditional movie theater on the

02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:44.720
same land.

02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:45.840
That's what they were going to do.

02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:47.680
I remember that.

02:11:47.680 --> 02:11:50.240
And he has a century promenade century promenade.

02:11:50.240 --> 02:11:50.740
Yeah.

02:11:51.220 --> 02:11:54.660
Now the question is, are they still is that is that going to be the cost effective idea?

02:11:54.660 --> 02:11:56.820
And I think the answer is no, it is not.

02:11:56.820 --> 02:11:59.940
I think people are now have now found out there is a place for drive ins.

02:12:01.060 --> 02:12:02.900
We wanted to do Rocky Horror at the drive in.

02:12:03.780 --> 02:12:05.540
But it didn't it ended up working out happening.

02:12:05.540 --> 02:12:05.940
They did.

02:12:05.940 --> 02:12:12.420
They did a I think they like showed the movies at drive ins this last Halloween, I think.

02:12:12.420 --> 02:12:16.820
But it ain't Rocky Horror if they're in a cast and all the other stuff that goes on

02:12:16.820 --> 02:12:17.300
with it.

02:12:17.300 --> 02:12:18.260
It's not the same.

02:12:18.260 --> 02:12:19.220
But yeah.

02:12:20.420 --> 02:12:22.420
So yeah, Questbuster says, I hear the same thing.

02:12:22.420 --> 02:12:24.660
Drive ins have gotten very popular because the pandemic.

02:12:24.660 --> 02:12:26.180
It's the only safe place to do shows.

02:12:26.180 --> 02:12:28.260
They're doing drag shows at drive ins now.

02:12:29.780 --> 02:12:30.900
It's the only safe place.

02:12:32.100 --> 02:12:37.780
The political rallies that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were doing were at drive ins.

02:12:38.420 --> 02:12:39.540
It's fascinating.

02:12:40.100 --> 02:12:46.100
So anyway, just it'll be very interesting to see what happens in a year.

02:12:46.100 --> 02:12:48.500
Is everything going to go back to normal in that regard?

02:12:48.500 --> 02:12:52.100
Or have some of our entertainment consumption needs changed?

02:12:52.100 --> 02:12:52.660
I don't know.

02:12:52.660 --> 02:12:54.420
Anyway, good tangent, you guys.

02:12:56.820 --> 02:12:58.020
Listener roundtable time.

02:12:58.020 --> 02:13:00.660
Well, that was a good little side topic.

02:13:00.660 --> 02:13:05.300
If you guys have any other questions or things to ask about or discuss here, send them in

02:13:05.300 --> 02:13:08.740
our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

02:13:09.300 --> 02:13:11.860
We would also open the mailbag at this point in the show.

02:13:11.860 --> 02:13:16.260
If you want to send us an email, participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to

02:13:16.260 --> 02:13:16.900
send emails.

02:13:16.900 --> 02:13:20.260
Unfortunately, this week, no emails, sad face.

02:13:20.260 --> 02:13:24.180
So participate at orange lounge radio.com if you want to send us something for next

02:13:24.180 --> 02:13:24.900
week.

02:13:24.900 --> 02:13:27.380
But I will ask if there's any last minute stories.

02:13:28.020 --> 02:13:29.140
Loki, did you catch anything?

02:13:29.940 --> 02:13:30.340
Yes.

02:13:30.340 --> 02:13:32.500
So there was one thing.

02:13:32.500 --> 02:13:41.940
And so apparently, uh, this guy goes by the name of Doppley has released a remake of the

02:13:41.940 --> 02:13:44.420
two Zelda CDI games.

02:13:44.980 --> 02:13:48.660
So he's remade faces of evil and one of Gamelon.

02:13:48.660 --> 02:13:49.160
Why?

02:13:50.500 --> 02:13:51.140
I'm just kidding.

02:13:51.140 --> 02:13:52.500
Worked on for four years.

02:13:52.500 --> 02:13:52.820
Wow.

02:13:52.820 --> 02:13:58.340
Release them and then took them down, uh, because of, uh, I think he's worried about

02:13:58.340 --> 02:14:00.260
game suit or something like that.

02:14:00.340 --> 02:14:02.100
But, uh, they're out there.

02:14:02.100 --> 02:14:05.780
If you know where to look for them, he put them up long enough for people to get.

02:14:05.780 --> 02:14:06.020
Yeah.

02:14:06.020 --> 02:14:08.020
Alan was telling me about this before the show tonight.

02:14:08.020 --> 02:14:11.620
So, um, I know this is the thing that's going around and it's, so it's, it's not an

02:14:11.620 --> 02:14:14.340
emulator for the CDI disks.

02:14:14.340 --> 02:14:14.980
It is.

02:14:14.980 --> 02:14:19.140
I ripped things from the CDI disks and built this in game maker, basically.

02:14:19.780 --> 02:14:20.580
Basically.

02:14:20.580 --> 02:14:20.980
Yeah.

02:14:20.980 --> 02:14:21.480
Yeah.

02:14:22.020 --> 02:14:26.420
Bobby Black Wolf with the plug for awesome games done quick saying wand of Gamelon will

02:14:26.420 --> 02:14:27.460
be part of that.

02:14:27.460 --> 02:14:29.540
I thought it was awesome games done quick.

02:14:30.900 --> 02:14:31.400
Yeah.

02:14:31.780 --> 02:14:32.340
Just teasing.

02:14:32.340 --> 02:14:32.740
Oh yes.

02:14:32.740 --> 02:14:34.500
Well, there is the awful block.

02:14:34.500 --> 02:14:34.660
Yeah.

02:14:34.660 --> 02:14:35.540
It's part of this.

02:14:35.540 --> 02:14:36.980
I think, I think they call it silly.

02:14:36.980 --> 02:14:38.020
Is it silly games?

02:14:38.580 --> 02:14:43.780
They call it, they, they call it something that's not like demeaning to the games.

02:14:43.780 --> 02:14:44.980
They call it silly game.

02:14:44.980 --> 02:14:45.860
Oh, silly games is.

02:14:46.500 --> 02:14:47.780
Oh, it is awful games.

02:14:47.780 --> 02:14:48.500
Well, all right.

02:14:48.500 --> 02:14:50.020
Then it's starting the awful block, I guess.

02:14:50.020 --> 02:14:50.180
Yeah.

02:14:50.180 --> 02:14:55.940
It's awful block because they have like, uh, Superman 64 and the CDI games.

02:14:55.940 --> 02:14:59.140
And, um, I'm trying to think of some of the other ones.

02:14:59.140 --> 02:15:04.500
I don't know if Pepsi man is part of the awful block, but it, you know, a lot of silly stuff

02:15:04.500 --> 02:15:05.000
like that.

02:15:06.260 --> 02:15:06.980
Uh, Dr.

02:15:06.980 --> 02:15:11.060
Tia says if Nintendo goes after it, would that count as acknowledging the CDI Zeldas?

02:15:11.060 --> 02:15:13.220
Ooh, it does put Nintendo in an interesting paradox.

02:15:13.220 --> 02:15:13.720
Doesn't it?

02:15:15.940 --> 02:15:19.300
I think they'd still have to probably shut it down out of, you know, protecting their

02:15:19.300 --> 02:15:23.060
trademark and that whole thing and making sure they never make a deal like that again.

02:15:24.100 --> 02:15:24.580
Sorry.

02:15:24.580 --> 02:15:25.700
Like no fan games.

02:15:26.660 --> 02:15:28.500
It's like, no, this was actually official.

02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:29.000
Oh.

02:15:29.940 --> 02:15:34.900
Um, so I referenced it earlier in the show, but I'll mention here during last minute stories.

02:15:34.900 --> 02:15:41.380
Uh, there was that whole kerfuffle going on with, uh, Uri, Uri Geller, the, the, you know,

02:15:41.380 --> 02:15:46.020
the guy he goes on, goes on TV and does like, um, like, uh, I think he was bigger in the

02:15:46.020 --> 02:15:47.380
seventies and eighties.

02:15:47.380 --> 02:15:52.900
He's basically a magician, but he claims to be, you know, tuned into the psychic stuff

02:15:52.900 --> 02:15:53.860
and Ben spoons.

02:15:53.860 --> 02:15:54.660
That was his big thing.

02:15:54.660 --> 02:15:55.700
You like Ben spoons.

02:15:55.700 --> 02:15:56.420
Oh yeah.

02:15:56.420 --> 02:15:57.140
Remember that guy?

02:15:57.700 --> 02:16:02.980
He had, they had a show, he had a reality show phenomenon.

02:16:02.980 --> 02:16:08.740
I think it was called, I remember it because that guy, Chris angel, who is really unpleasant

02:16:08.740 --> 02:16:09.540
was on it too.

02:16:09.540 --> 02:16:15.380
And like him and a contestant like fucking fought, which I thought was weird, but yeah,

02:16:15.380 --> 02:16:16.340
that was Uri Geller.

02:16:16.340 --> 02:16:24.100
Anyway, the point is he had apparently got into it when Nintendo, like 20 years ago over

02:16:24.100 --> 02:16:29.380
the character Kadabra, you know, there's Abra, Kadabra, Alakazam.

02:16:29.380 --> 02:16:35.220
Well, Kadabra has a spoon and then the anime and shit, like he does, like he has the spoon

02:16:35.220 --> 02:16:41.220
of his, and apparently the Japanese name is something like Uri Geller or something.

02:16:41.220 --> 02:16:44.100
It's like something that's very similar to the guy's name.

02:16:44.100 --> 02:16:49.540
So like Nintendo basically kind of had to admit, yes, it was partially inspired by him.

02:16:49.540 --> 02:16:54.500
And so they took the character, Kadabra has not been in the anime since then.

02:16:54.500 --> 02:16:57.140
They don't even have the cards anymore and all this.

02:16:57.140 --> 02:17:02.020
Well, this past week, Uri Geller basically said, I'm dropping it.

02:17:02.020 --> 02:17:03.540
I, and he apologized.

02:17:03.540 --> 02:17:06.180
He's basically saying, I'm sorry for this 20 year old issues.

02:17:06.180 --> 02:17:07.780
I'm now lifting the ban.

02:17:07.780 --> 02:17:10.900
And if Nintendo wants to remake the card, they can, but they're going to have to do

02:17:10.900 --> 02:17:11.060
it.

02:17:11.060 --> 02:17:14.660
I imagine it will make the cards more valuable, LOL basically.

02:17:14.660 --> 02:17:18.020
And so not sure what brought him to have a change of heart.

02:17:18.740 --> 02:17:21.380
Perhaps he had a grand kid or a kid or something.

02:17:21.380 --> 02:17:22.260
Say something about it.

02:17:22.260 --> 02:17:22.660
Maybe.

02:17:22.660 --> 02:17:23.060
I don't know.

02:17:23.060 --> 02:17:23.780
It could be anything.

02:17:24.660 --> 02:17:28.260
But yeah, it was kind of an interesting piece of news to come out of nowhere after 20 years

02:17:28.260 --> 02:17:31.940
that, oh, the Pokemon Kadabra can exist again.

02:17:31.940 --> 02:17:33.300
Thanks to Uri Geller.

02:17:33.300 --> 02:17:34.260
So it's kind of interesting.

02:17:34.900 --> 02:17:36.180
So that is interesting.

02:17:36.180 --> 02:17:36.680
Yeah.

02:17:37.940 --> 02:17:42.260
Act Deft in chat says like, it's good that he finally gave in, but it was pretty shady

02:17:42.260 --> 02:17:46.100
of him to actually promote himself while having a change of heart.

02:17:46.100 --> 02:17:50.820
Yeah, it a little bit, but he did have a change of heart.

02:17:50.820 --> 02:17:52.260
So there's that.

02:17:52.260 --> 02:17:59.460
Plus, a lot of things you have to really sell yourself when you're one of those types of

02:17:59.460 --> 02:17:59.780
people.

02:17:59.780 --> 02:18:00.340
You know what I mean?

02:18:00.340 --> 02:18:01.620
It's about the personality.

02:18:03.780 --> 02:18:06.660
Bobby Blackwell is pointing out the other games in the awful block.

02:18:07.300 --> 02:18:10.820
Wand of Gamelon, King's Quest, Mask of Eternity.

02:18:11.460 --> 02:18:19.300
Peanut Bee, Wings of Adventure, Epic Dumpster Bear 2, He Who Bears Wins, Snow White and

02:18:19.300 --> 02:18:20.740
Happily Ever After.

02:18:20.740 --> 02:18:21.460
Oh, God.

02:18:22.740 --> 02:18:23.380
That's right.

02:18:23.380 --> 02:18:25.940
Didn't they do a sequel to Snow White in the 90s?

02:18:25.940 --> 02:18:28.980
And then they did a game based on it, and it was fucking awful.

02:18:29.940 --> 02:18:32.500
I don't think it was a Disney thing either.

02:18:32.500 --> 02:18:35.780
I think it was like the rights to the book became public domain or something.

02:18:35.780 --> 02:18:36.280
I don't know.

02:18:36.760 --> 02:18:40.680
Anyway, yeah, because the same thing happened with Oz.

02:18:41.960 --> 02:18:46.840
Disney got the rights to Oz, and they made Return to Oz, which was not well received.

02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:53.080
But if you were a kid in the 80s like me or Loki, that movie scared the shit out of me

02:18:53.080 --> 02:18:54.200
when I was a kid.

02:18:54.200 --> 02:18:57.160
That was a fucked up thing to show kids in the 80s.

02:18:57.160 --> 02:19:05.960
When you start a movie with asylum and shock therapy, and then a woman that was able to

02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:09.160
take off heads and stuff like that, it's a little creepy.

02:19:09.160 --> 02:19:10.520
That was creepy.

02:19:10.520 --> 02:19:11.480
Anyway, yeah, exactly.

02:19:12.200 --> 02:19:13.080
And let's see the other game.

02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:15.560
Sorry, we got a tangent thanks to the Snow White sequel.

02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:19.720
Alcatraz Prison Escape and Mr. Bones.

02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:21.480
So there you go.

02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:25.400
And Bobby confirming that the Snow White game was a Super Nintendo game.

02:19:25.400 --> 02:19:29.080
Yeah, that's about the right time frame, because I think I remember being in high school, and

02:19:29.080 --> 02:19:30.360
it was like a big ass deal.

02:19:30.360 --> 02:19:34.280
They were releasing a sequel to Snow White, but I don't think it was Disney.

02:19:34.280 --> 02:19:37.560
It was another company that did it, and it was garbage.

02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:39.560
It was a garbage movie.

02:19:39.560 --> 02:19:41.240
It was really bad.

02:19:41.240 --> 02:19:44.360
So anyway, all right.

02:19:45.240 --> 02:19:46.920
Any other last minute stories?

02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:49.800
If you guys have any questions for us in chat, now's a good time to shout it out.

02:19:52.360 --> 02:19:54.760
No, I didn't really have anything else, I think.

02:19:54.760 --> 02:19:55.800
Okay, that's fine.

02:19:57.800 --> 02:20:00.120
Let's see, looking at some other comments in chat.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.720
Bobby's saying it was obviously the overnight block.

02:20:03.720 --> 02:20:08.280
With my luck, that will be one of my shifts, because I said I like Sierra games.

02:20:08.280 --> 02:20:09.560
You know what, Bobby?

02:20:09.560 --> 02:20:12.360
I would be honored to do the King's Quest Mask of Eternity.

02:20:12.360 --> 02:20:15.240
I, it's bad, yes.

02:20:15.240 --> 02:20:16.120
Is it awful?

02:20:17.480 --> 02:20:18.520
I don't know, maybe.

02:20:18.520 --> 02:20:19.400
I don't know.

02:20:19.400 --> 02:20:24.920
I think, Bobby, if you get King's Quest, I think you should smile and accept that.

02:20:24.920 --> 02:20:27.880
All right, let's see.

02:20:28.840 --> 02:20:30.840
Some folks talking about Pepsiman.

02:20:30.840 --> 02:20:31.880
Oh, thank you, Rama.

02:20:31.880 --> 02:20:32.920
Rama found it.

02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:40.520
MeTV is the streaming service with mama's family at metv.com.

02:20:41.240 --> 02:20:41.640
Thank you.

02:20:43.320 --> 02:20:49.240
ActDeft in chat says, in Mexico, video game news, the Mexican government is finally releasing

02:20:49.240 --> 02:20:53.480
their version of the ESRB, and it's like, really?

02:20:53.480 --> 02:20:54.920
Wow, that did take a long time.

02:20:54.920 --> 02:20:56.280
That was a little bit delayed, wasn't it?

02:20:56.920 --> 02:20:58.200
All right, awesome, awesome.

02:20:59.400 --> 02:21:00.360
All right.

02:21:00.360 --> 02:21:03.960
Anyhow, all right, I think that's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

02:21:03.960 --> 02:21:07.560
Thank you guys very much for tuning into our show this week, whether you listen live here

02:21:07.560 --> 02:21:12.760
at Twitch, or you downloaded us on the podcast feed on iTunes or Spotify, or most of the

02:21:12.760 --> 02:21:15.080
places where you can find podcasts, we really appreciate it.

02:21:15.080 --> 02:21:15.880
Thank you.

02:21:15.880 --> 02:21:16.920
Help us spread the word.

02:21:16.920 --> 02:21:19.640
Tell a friend or two about our show.

02:21:19.640 --> 02:21:22.680
Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if

02:21:22.680 --> 02:21:25.560
the voices aren't here to put out on air, then you don't have them here.

02:21:26.280 --> 02:21:31.720
So thank you again to those of you that are here, those of you that auto host us on Twitch.

02:21:31.720 --> 02:21:32.520
Thank you, thank you.

02:21:32.520 --> 02:21:34.120
That goes an awful long way.

02:21:34.120 --> 02:21:36.680
Thank you to all the new follows and bits and subs.

02:21:36.680 --> 02:21:39.880
I'll acknowledge those after the credits tonight here on Twitch.

02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:41.560
And just thank you for being here.

02:21:41.560 --> 02:21:45.240
I know it was a busy week with the holidays, so appreciate you guys still being here tonight

02:21:45.240 --> 02:21:48.040
and making room for OLR at your dinner table.

02:21:49.320 --> 02:21:51.640
With that, I think we'll go around and get final thoughts.

02:21:51.640 --> 02:21:53.240
Oh, before I do, though, I have to mention this.

02:21:53.240 --> 02:21:56.760
My God, I should have mentioned this at the top of the show and I forgot, but I want to

02:21:56.760 --> 02:21:59.560
make sure here at the end, I acknowledge our shop.

02:22:00.440 --> 02:22:01.320
We have a brand new...

02:22:01.320 --> 02:22:05.880
I know why I didn't say it because we said it a lot last week and we were kind of like,

02:22:05.880 --> 02:22:07.640
okay, you don't have to sell it so much.

02:22:07.640 --> 02:22:14.120
But I do want to mention over at the VOG Network shop, over at vognetwork.com slash shop, we

02:22:14.120 --> 02:22:16.600
now have some OLR related items.

02:22:16.600 --> 02:22:20.440
And Loki, again, you're finding this out here because I just put them up about an hour before

02:22:20.440 --> 02:22:21.240
we went on air.

02:22:21.240 --> 02:22:28.280
But your OLR pixel art that became an Xbox official avatar years ago, which sadly you

02:22:28.280 --> 02:22:29.320
can no longer get.

02:22:29.320 --> 02:22:35.160
But that OLR pixel art is now available as a sticker so you can make anything OLR.

02:22:35.160 --> 02:22:35.960
It's one of those nice...

02:22:35.960 --> 02:22:39.960
It's actually cut in the shape of the OLR logo with like a white border around it.

02:22:39.960 --> 02:22:41.320
So it's a really nice looking sticker.

02:22:41.320 --> 02:22:42.520
I kind of want to get one of those.

02:22:42.520 --> 02:22:43.800
So you can make anything OLR.

02:22:43.800 --> 02:22:47.480
And we have some OLR pixel art shirts and you can put them on.

02:22:47.480 --> 02:22:50.360
And I picked a different shirt than the VOG shirts.

02:22:50.360 --> 02:22:53.720
They're a little more expensive, but they kind of look like a baseball jersey.

02:22:53.720 --> 02:22:55.080
I think they look kind of cool.

02:22:55.080 --> 02:22:57.320
So we'll see if anybody takes interest in those.

02:22:57.320 --> 02:22:59.000
I'm totally getting one of those.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:22:59.500
Yeah.

02:23:00.520 --> 02:23:00.760
Yeah.

02:23:00.760 --> 02:23:05.160
Act Def says, I still have that OLR Xbox avatar on the Xbox profile.

02:23:05.160 --> 02:23:05.960
Me too.

02:23:05.960 --> 02:23:07.480
Thank you guys that still rock that.

02:23:07.480 --> 02:23:08.040
There is a...

02:23:08.040 --> 02:23:09.880
There's a Bobby Black Wolf one out there too.

02:23:09.880 --> 02:23:12.280
But again, you can't download them anymore.

02:23:12.280 --> 02:23:13.080
They were...

02:23:13.080 --> 02:23:16.200
And it has nothing to do with the fact that we aren't on all games anymore because that

02:23:16.760 --> 02:23:19.480
that it was a pack of all games.

02:23:19.480 --> 02:23:23.960
All the shows on all games at the time had like a gamer pic that went to Xbox Live.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:30.120
And they just, they pulled it after like four years or something like that.

02:23:30.120 --> 02:23:32.440
So it was available for a long time, but sadly not anymore.

02:23:34.200 --> 02:23:37.720
Very few, what was I gonna say?

02:23:37.720 --> 02:23:41.880
Very few of the people are even rocking the old school type of avatars.

02:23:41.960 --> 02:23:47.800
Because ever since Xbox released their version of the Miis, their avatars,

02:23:47.800 --> 02:23:50.040
that's kind of what a lot of people use now.

02:23:50.040 --> 02:23:52.680
So it's very, very rare you see the old school stuff.

02:23:53.720 --> 02:23:59.400
And SSJ100 Matt says, please put the stickers on personal items and not random folks property.

02:23:59.400 --> 02:24:03.720
Yes, please do not use the sticker as graffiti because that just makes us look bad.

02:24:03.720 --> 02:24:04.680
So thank you.

02:24:04.680 --> 02:24:07.800
Akuma JP says, need an OLR mug.

02:24:07.800 --> 02:24:08.520
It's coming.

02:24:09.160 --> 02:24:09.640
Wait.

02:24:09.640 --> 02:24:15.800
I'm waiting for Loki to finish the VOG pixel art that matches the OLR one,

02:24:15.800 --> 02:24:20.840
because we're gonna do a mug that has OLR on one side and VOG on the other, both in pixel art.

02:24:20.840 --> 02:24:21.560
So that is coming.

02:24:21.560 --> 02:24:22.200
I'll work on that.

02:24:22.200 --> 02:24:22.700
It's coming.

02:24:23.320 --> 02:24:23.820
All right.

02:24:26.360 --> 02:24:26.680
All right.

02:24:26.680 --> 02:24:27.240
That's it.

02:24:27.240 --> 02:24:28.440
We're gonna wrap up.

02:24:28.440 --> 02:24:29.560
Oh, we didn't get final thoughts.

02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:29.880
Sorry.

02:24:29.880 --> 02:24:30.120
Sorry.

02:24:30.120 --> 02:24:32.200
I just remembered to put that plug out there.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:34.360
We are gonna make a mug.

02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:38.120
Pixel Pacas, there is a Bobby Black Wolf mug available in the store right now, however.

02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:41.640
And, you know, Bobby is absolutely worthy of showing support too as well.

02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:43.640
So, uh, uh, check that out.

02:24:43.640 --> 02:24:45.160
Anyway, vognetwork.com slash shop.

02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:45.400
Okay.

02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:45.800
I'll stop.

02:24:45.800 --> 02:24:47.480
I'll stop, uh, the advertisement.

02:24:48.040 --> 02:24:49.160
Let's get to final thoughts.

02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:49.660
Loki.

02:24:50.760 --> 02:24:58.280
Um, so I'm just gonna be working on my game this week and I still shooting the launch this year.

02:24:59.320 --> 02:24:59.640
All right.

02:25:00.440 --> 02:25:04.120
My final thought is, uh, the new Pokemon go level should be this week.

02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:07.320
So I hope I hit 41 by next week.

02:25:07.320 --> 02:25:07.800
We'll see.

02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:09.400
We'll catch up on the show.

02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:11.320
Uh, stay safe, everybody.

02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:15.240
If you did have a big Thanksgiving out there because, um, you just, you weren't able to

02:25:15.240 --> 02:25:19.720
get out of family obligations, even though there's a pandemic going on, um, please, uh,

02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:23.000
limit your interactions out there in the real world.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:26.360
Uh, at least 10 days, really 14 is even better.

02:25:26.360 --> 02:25:31.640
Um, please do your part to help stop the spread of COVID-19 because it's, it's everywhere.

02:25:31.640 --> 02:25:34.360
You guys it's, it's pretty, uh, pretty scary.

02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:38.760
So, um, you know, if you have to stick to yourself and play some video games for a couple

02:25:38.760 --> 02:25:41.160
of weeks, there's really never been a better time.

02:25:41.160 --> 02:25:42.680
So, uh, that's it.

02:25:42.680 --> 02:25:43.880
Stay safe, everybody.

02:25:43.880 --> 02:25:48.520
We'll be back in seven days to talk more video games and more stuff here on OLR.

02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:49.720
Jamie will be back.

02:25:49.720 --> 02:25:53.240
We have the, uh, exciting straight shit from YYR games.

02:25:53.240 --> 02:25:54.680
So very excited to get that as well.

02:25:54.680 --> 02:25:57.880
So it's going to be a busy December here at VOG Network and OLR.

02:25:57.880 --> 02:25:58.760
Have a good night, everybody.
