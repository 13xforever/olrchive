00:00.000 --> 00:13.320
Hello! It's that time of year where I say if you're hearing my voice, it means that

00:13.320 --> 00:17.980
your clock is set appropriately, where appropriately it is 6pm Pacific GMT-8, that is. Either that

00:17.980 --> 00:21.280
or you're listening time shifted, in either case, thank you! It's the calm before the

00:21.280 --> 00:24.600
storm in the year of our misery, and it's about to become exhausting in the home stretch

00:24.600 --> 00:28.180
of the holidays. Don't get whiplash keeping up with the news. Before you turn on Do Not

00:28.180 --> 00:31.940
Disturb and go for a walk, join our hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki as we

00:31.940 --> 00:35.140
discuss the things we have, the things we're getting, the things we're not yet sure about,

00:35.140 --> 00:37.420
starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.420 --> 00:45.500
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

00:45.500 --> 00:53.060
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again tonight with episode

00:53.060 --> 01:01.820
number 841 for this November 1st of 2020. My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me live

01:01.820 --> 01:05.580
here on the feed tonight is Techmaster Loki. Hi, Loki!

01:05.580 --> 01:07.920
Hello. How are you doing?

01:07.920 --> 01:08.920
I'm doing fine.

01:08.920 --> 01:13.220
It is good to see you. Sadly, we don't have Dark Sakura just yet. There is some type of

01:13.220 --> 01:17.860
technical difficulty going on on her end with the computer reboot, so I expect her to jump

01:17.860 --> 01:22.920
in here at any moment to join us for the show and we'll get things underway, that's

01:22.920 --> 01:28.300
for sure. In the meantime, before we get into our kickoff topic for tonight, Loki, how's

01:28.300 --> 01:33.700
the game progressing? This big mystery project you've been talking about for weeks and weeks.

01:33.700 --> 01:38.700
I know nothing about it because you're very secretive. You're being a AAA game company

01:38.700 --> 01:42.300
right now and I want to tell people about it. How is that coming along?

01:42.300 --> 01:46.060
I thought about putting my own yellow text out, but I didn't.

01:46.060 --> 01:49.260
Oh yeah, right. Oh yeah, we'll get into that later, that's for sure.

01:49.260 --> 01:58.820
Yeah. No, it's going okay. So this week it's been, it was finalizing the random spawn generator,

01:58.820 --> 02:08.540
which I did, and then hooking up audio, so I did that as well. And yeah, that's been

02:08.540 --> 02:09.980
what I've been working on now.

02:09.980 --> 02:14.140
Are you willing to say an estimated release date or are you afraid it's going to turn

02:14.140 --> 02:17.180
into a situation similar to a cyberpunk?

02:17.180 --> 02:25.700
Well, I can't say anything right now because I can't really go into more details about

02:25.700 --> 02:32.540
that either because that would give stuff away. So I can't say anything because I can't

02:32.540 --> 02:40.180
say any more. That's all I can say. I'm trying to get it. I'm hoping to have it ready this,

02:40.180 --> 02:47.020
hopefully this month or even, you know, definitely this year. I can't, I can't really go into

02:47.020 --> 02:49.660
more details. Sorry. Otherwise it would spoil things.

02:49.660 --> 02:52.780
I'm going to get the details from your kitty, Stella. That's for sure. That's where I'm

02:52.780 --> 02:53.780
going to get the details.

02:53.780 --> 02:56.940
Yeah, she knows I'm on a call. So now it's, now it's time to start screaming at me.

02:56.940 --> 03:00.500
That's okay. I'm expecting Smush to run in here any minute. We do tape live of course

03:00.500 --> 03:04.800
at the voice geeks network, twitch.tv slash a vog network every Sunday night at six o'clock

03:04.800 --> 03:09.180
Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And I'm trying to read

03:09.180 --> 03:13.300
through chat on what's going on. Okay. I'll tell you what's going on. So one of my pals

03:13.300 --> 03:18.820
from, so it was like a year ago on this show, I talked about that, that survivor LARP that

03:18.820 --> 03:23.740
I was playing online that I won. Right. So one of my pals that played that game with

03:23.740 --> 03:28.580
me, Karen, just joined the chat. So shout out to Karen. Karen and I never got to interact

03:28.580 --> 03:32.920
during the game cause we were on like opposite tribes and we even got swapped opposite each

03:32.920 --> 03:36.320
other. So I never really got to interact with Karen, but I've adored her everything I've

03:36.320 --> 03:40.880
learned about her after the game. So, um, what is going on? So I'm looking to chat and

03:40.880 --> 03:46.600
Karen joins and everyone wants to turn it into a discussion about the, the, the term

03:46.600 --> 03:51.380
Karen, uh, that is used to talk about the whole, you know, uh, Kate from John and Kate

03:51.380 --> 03:55.660
plus eight, I want to speak to your manager and all of that stuff. Y'all, y'all, how old

03:55.660 --> 04:00.200
are you? 12? Like I thought we stopped making fun of people over their names. Knock it off.

04:00.200 --> 04:06.160
Shame. Finally. My name is something you don't want to do to a bank so you can let people

04:06.160 --> 04:11.620
live over their names. Good heavens. Good heavens. Where's my shame bell? Ding, ding,

04:11.620 --> 04:17.180
ding, ding, ding. All right. Y'all know better, but I know, no, I know, I know most of the

04:17.180 --> 04:23.220
time y'all are cool and I also know that everybody's just real tense right now cause there's a certain

04:23.220 --> 04:28.860
thing going on in America this Tuesday that has a lot of people on edge and pointed and

04:28.860 --> 04:34.580
with a lot of opinions on everything. So I get it. I get it. I just hope y'all have made

04:34.580 --> 04:39.320
your voting plan. I've been talking about it for weeks and weeks on this program. Yes,

04:39.320 --> 04:45.580
we play video games, but it's important to use those voices in, you know, what the government

04:45.580 --> 04:49.460
gives you the right to do, what the constitution gives you the right to do and vote because

04:49.460 --> 04:54.340
you're damn right. Government can influence what goes on with video games, right? We've

04:54.340 --> 04:59.480
talked about countless issues here on this program, such as remember in California when

04:59.480 --> 05:05.840
they were going to say that GameStop could no longer sell a mature game, but that concept

05:05.840 --> 05:11.940
of what is a mature game was very kind of nebulous as to what that was. That's definitely

05:11.940 --> 05:17.240
a political thing. So yes, politics can impact video games. So I hope y'all have made your

05:17.240 --> 05:22.720
voting plan. Get on that. Just so you know, you know, with the election on Tuesday, if

05:22.720 --> 05:27.840
you're planning to vote by mail, it's, it's kind of too late unless you already did it

05:27.840 --> 05:31.960
in a lot of places. So that's why I told you two weeks ago to get your voting plan

05:31.960 --> 05:38.080
going. But it's not too late to go vote in person. Or at least you can take. Hi, Jamie.

05:38.080 --> 05:43.480
We hear, Jamie, we hear you. Just a moment. Jamie, we hear you. I don't think she hears

05:43.480 --> 05:50.320
us. All right. So, but make sure that you take your ballot in person, if nothing else.

05:50.320 --> 05:55.120
Don't actually drop that in the mail. So, all right. Good. Everybody and everybody in

05:55.120 --> 05:59.640
chat is sharing their plans. Love to see it. Love to see it. Okay, so I think Dark

05:59.640 --> 06:04.520
Sakura joined us. Can you hear me now, Jamie? Nope, she can't. She's, she's having some

06:04.520 --> 06:08.960
issues, I guess. Maybe now. Maybe it'll be better. That's the joy of doing live radio

06:08.960 --> 06:14.480
is that sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. But I see the little webcam loading

06:14.480 --> 06:17.560
in. So hopefully we'll have a Jamie here in a minute. Hi, Dark Sakura. Can you hear us

06:17.560 --> 06:25.600
okay? Okay, something, something weird is going on. But that's all right. All right.

06:25.600 --> 06:29.560
Looking at some comments in chat. Black and Pat says surrendered my mail to early vote

06:29.560 --> 06:35.400
in person. Okay. The break man says I live near the early voting place. It's been busy

06:35.400 --> 06:40.580
every day. I've never seen anything like it. DGRama S says my polling place is three blocks

06:40.580 --> 06:45.100
from my house. I'll be heading over after I eat breakfast. Good. Bobby Blackwell says

06:45.100 --> 06:49.060
I'm going Tuesday. That's fine. If you're willing to do the waiting on the day of that's

06:49.060 --> 06:56.900
that's totally fine. And we have folks not from America voicing their support. Karen,

06:56.900 --> 07:01.380
who I mentioned earlier, says I'm Canadian, but I support you all. And Act Deaf brings

07:01.380 --> 07:05.520
up the fact that I'm Mexican and the same goes for my part. So we appreciate we appreciate

07:05.520 --> 07:09.740
the love from other countries. And we hope you all participate in the similar processes

07:09.740 --> 07:14.660
in your countries if they are afforded to you depending on where you live, whenever

07:14.660 --> 07:18.820
those elections may be. Okay. So we're still waiting for Dark Soccer to join us. Clearly

07:18.820 --> 07:22.660
she's having some technical issues. We're going to try our best to get through those.

07:22.660 --> 07:27.220
For now, I'm going to jump into the kickoff topic. I apologize. The webcam looks a little

07:27.220 --> 07:31.020
weird. I just have to keep switching between when there's one person on Discord and when

07:31.020 --> 07:34.900
there's two. But we're going to try to get into the top of the show here. So and our

07:34.900 --> 07:40.100
kickoff topic. So, Loki, do you want to start us off on a kickoff topic? Because, you know,

07:40.100 --> 07:45.020
we're only like not even two weeks from brand new game console releases. Right. And we have

07:45.020 --> 07:50.840
a week. Yeah. Like just over a week. We have Xbox Series X. We have PlayStation 5 both

07:50.840 --> 07:59.000
coming out in the next couple of weeks. So we have that coming. And we still don't have

07:59.000 --> 08:03.460
all the answers as to how it's necessarily going to work, which is a little bit scary,

08:03.460 --> 08:09.100
I think. Yeah. So. Yeah. So. So. Wait, hold on just one sec. Did Dark Soccer get in OK?

08:09.100 --> 08:15.540
Can you hear us? For some reason, she still can't hear us, even though we see her fine,

08:15.540 --> 08:19.140
so we'll have to figure that out. All right. Well, anyway, why don't you tell us what's

08:19.140 --> 08:25.060
going on, Loki? Yeah. So we're the question's been, you know, especially with these consoles

08:25.060 --> 08:29.740
now supporting backwards compatibility to a certain extent is, well, how much backwards

08:29.740 --> 08:36.900
compatibility are they actually supporting? So with Sony, we're not really sure. They

08:36.900 --> 08:42.300
said most games are backwards compatible. But apparently on Ubisoft, they had a blog

08:42.300 --> 08:48.780
post listing that there are certain compatibility issues or certain games that wouldn't be backwards

08:48.780 --> 08:54.220
compatible on Xbox and PlayStation. It said basically on PlayStation five, all games will

08:54.220 --> 08:58.580
be backwards compatible, except for the following ones. Assassin's Creed Syndicate, Assassin's

08:58.580 --> 09:03.620
Creed Chronicles trilogy pack, Assassin's Creed Chronicles India, Assassin's Creed Chronicles

09:03.620 --> 09:09.580
China, Assassin's Creed Chronicles Russia, Risk, Star Trek, Bridge Crew, Werewolves Within

09:09.580 --> 09:16.780
and Space Junkies. However, they have later retracted that blog post and just to basically

09:16.780 --> 09:25.860
put a generic, you know, we pulled the Ubisoft Connect article and form regarding backwards

09:25.860 --> 09:30.740
compatibility for the time being, as there may be some inaccuracies involved with the

09:30.740 --> 09:37.260
Ubisoft titles that were playable on PlayStation five. So they haven't yet listed which titles

09:37.260 --> 09:45.360
are going to be having issues on there. But I guess we'll have to wait and see. And this

09:45.360 --> 09:51.380
is crazy because, you know, when we saw that list of what games would and would not be

09:51.380 --> 09:55.220
backwards compatible or I should just say would not because it was very short list from

09:55.220 --> 10:00.100
Sony. You know, there were 10 games on it. But with all due respect to the developers,

10:00.100 --> 10:05.460
they were not 10 major games, they were games that people could kind of give or take, I

10:05.460 --> 10:10.180
think. They were not, you know, you had nothing major on that list. But now Ubisoft is coming

10:10.180 --> 10:14.900
out with this list. And I would say Assassin's Creed and those games and many of the games

10:14.900 --> 10:20.180
that Loki made. Those are pretty major games. Now we're having an issue. So it's, it's a

10:20.180 --> 10:25.720
little weird that we're finding all of this out like what not even two weeks to go before

10:25.720 --> 10:31.000
the release of the console. Now, there could be a weird miscommunication. It could be that

10:31.000 --> 10:36.200
maybe Ubisoft doesn't have the most recent development kits or something. Maybe there was

10:36.200 --> 10:41.160
a late addition to the emulator software that Sony's working with. So maybe Ubisoft's been

10:41.160 --> 10:45.960
doing their own tests, and they're not concurrent with Sony. That's kind of what I think is really

10:45.960 --> 10:50.600
happening. I think Ubisoft is playing with one version of the emulator, and Sony's on the other,

10:50.600 --> 10:54.760
at least that's what I hope. Because if it turns out that Sony has been kind of like,

10:54.760 --> 10:58.520
I don't want to say lying to us, but that's what it's sure going to feel like. That's what it's

10:58.520 --> 11:03.000
going to come across like. With the backwards compatibility thing, that is going to leave a

11:03.000 --> 11:08.280
really sour taste in people's mouths. I just want to jump in here because I see Jamie on camera. I

11:08.280 --> 11:13.640
want to know if we have her on the show officially. Hi, Jamie, are you with us? Okay, we don't hear

11:13.640 --> 11:17.480
you. You're muted on Discord. I can see the mute icon. Oh, she's trying to fix it. Okay.

11:17.560 --> 11:23.320
Try now. Hooray! You're here! The headset I'm using now has a kind of weird setup for the mute.

11:24.760 --> 11:30.200
Basically, you know how I was using my work headset before this? I found on one of those

11:30.200 --> 11:37.320
resale sites someone had a better version of my work mic, and I offered him 10 bucks for it,

11:37.320 --> 11:43.000
and I got it for 10 bucks, and it sounds a lot better. Yeah, you sound great. Yeah, well,

11:43.720 --> 11:50.120
the headset sounds great. I don't. Well, okay, I know you've been dealing with a little bit of

11:50.120 --> 11:54.520
sick. Let's finish the Ubisoft topic, and then I'll come to catch up with Dark Sakura, okay?

11:54.520 --> 11:58.280
All right, so I'm just glad you're here, and you made it despite all those tech issues. All right,

11:59.000 --> 12:02.600
so anyway, the Ubisoft thing. So, Loki, what's your takeaway from this? Do you think this is

12:03.400 --> 12:10.520
Sony's lion, or do you think Ubisoft is not testing correctly? What's your read on what's

12:10.600 --> 12:16.600
going on here? I'm curious about you guys in chat too. I don't know what the issue is with it,

12:16.600 --> 12:20.360
but they're not mainline Assassin's Creed games. They were the ones that were out like on the

12:20.360 --> 12:26.280
PlayStation Store or the Xbox original, not original, Xbox Live Arcade stuff.

12:26.280 --> 12:32.280
Those are basically the games that they had. I don't know. I don't really play Assassin's Creed.

12:32.280 --> 12:38.120
I don't think it's a big deal either way. They're minor games. Maybe they're going to release a

12:38.120 --> 12:43.160
different version for them. Maybe they're just working on backwards compatibility and it's not

12:43.160 --> 12:47.720
going to be backwards compatible at launch or something, and maybe they're not willing to say,

12:47.720 --> 12:54.040
oh, it's not going to work at all, maybe just wanting to give a certain date for it. I don't

12:54.040 --> 12:59.480
know. It doesn't really matter. I don't think it's a big deal, but they could be a little bit

12:59.480 --> 13:06.520
more clear about it because I know when we're talking about the other console, it is more clear

13:06.520 --> 13:11.640
on what games that supports and which ones it doesn't. Going to our chat over at twitch.tv

13:11.640 --> 13:17.880
vog network, Fifth Dream says, if your entire reason for being is playing old games or old

13:17.880 --> 13:22.840
Assassin's Creed on a new console, just leave your PlayStation 4 plugged in. You're a small

13:22.840 --> 13:30.200
percentage of zero percentage. Respectfully, I could not disagree more. Go ahead, Loki,

13:30.200 --> 13:34.600
I'll get my content. I get that, but it's a value proposition because basically, say for example,

13:34.600 --> 13:38.280
not everybody's like loaded with money to buy these new consoles. They're expensive.

13:38.280 --> 13:43.160
And maybe the plan was I'm going to trade my old console in, get some money for it or sell it off

13:43.160 --> 13:47.880
and then buy it because I heard that these games are backwards compatible on that console. So I'm

13:47.880 --> 13:53.160
not really losing my library they've purchased online and I can use these console, this new

13:53.160 --> 13:57.800
console to play those games. And maybe you're counting on that because you have some money

13:57.800 --> 14:02.200
invested with this old console. So you can't really afford to keep both of them. Or maybe

14:02.200 --> 14:06.600
you just don't want to have both of them hooked up. It's like, I know, you know, the PlayStation

14:06.600 --> 14:10.280
3 games aren't really supported too well on that console and I don't want to have to hook my

14:10.280 --> 14:15.720
PlayStation 3 back up or PlayStation 2 or whatever the case may be. I only have finite amount of

14:15.720 --> 14:23.080
space around my TV. So I don't know. I get it. I get the argument that, yeah, maybe you could just

14:23.080 --> 14:29.080
keep both plugged in, but it's not the most ideal situation. Right. And here's why I said what I

14:29.080 --> 14:34.120
said about, you know, I really disagree with the comment. I'm sorry. And you're not alone in your

14:34.120 --> 14:38.200
thinking. I've had to kind of respond to this a lot with my take on it. But I think especially

14:38.200 --> 14:43.560
with this generation of games, we have new consoles that are really starting to feel like,

14:43.560 --> 14:51.560
you know, PC or computer type of upgrades where, you know, a lot of the argument is really being

14:51.560 --> 14:57.800
made on this, especially with a lack of launch titles on both sides. I mean, really, I mean,

14:57.800 --> 15:02.040
sure. Okay. You have Miles Morales, which is also on PS4. You have the Demon's Souls remake. And

15:02.040 --> 15:06.920
then on the Xbox side, you have like one or two things, but like, you know, Halo got bumped back.

15:06.920 --> 15:12.600
So, I mean, on both consoles, I'm sorry, you have a relatively lackluster launch. So they're really

15:12.600 --> 15:20.040
trying to make the argument on this is going to make your old games even better. And Sony's been

15:20.040 --> 15:25.080
making that argument from the beginning. Think back to that early reveal when it was first

15:25.080 --> 15:29.880
revealed in that, I think it was a Wired article about the PlayStation 5 and some of the technical

15:29.880 --> 15:35.240
aspects of it. What game were they using to show off the PlayStation 5? They weren't using Demon's

15:35.240 --> 15:41.080
Souls. They were using Spider-Man from the PlayStation 4 and showing how the solid state

15:41.080 --> 15:47.560
drive could improve the loading times and improve the experience of the PlayStation 4. So my point

15:47.560 --> 15:54.600
is, yes, people want to play the old games on the new console because both Sony and Microsoft have

15:54.680 --> 16:00.120
been making the argument the old games will be better in this new experience. And that is what

16:00.120 --> 16:06.920
has sold me on an Xbox Series X for launch day is because, again, I've talked about this on the show

16:06.920 --> 16:14.280
before, I opted into Xbox Series X because my Xbox One is older and I never got into the One X, you

16:14.280 --> 16:18.920
know, the incremental upgrade there. So I really feel like there are going to be a lot of old games

16:18.920 --> 16:24.280
that are going to play a lot better on Series X. I am very much looking forward to revisiting

16:24.280 --> 16:29.880
something like Forza Horizon 4, which is a beautiful racing game. I can't wait to try it

16:29.880 --> 16:36.520
in 4K, 60 frames a second. That's going to be awesome. So that's, you know, to me, when they're

16:36.520 --> 16:41.880
kind of like making the old generation a part of this new generation, that's why it's like really

16:41.880 --> 16:48.680
dicey. I think that, yikes, suddenly these games may not work after all, but you've been saying

16:48.680 --> 16:52.920
it's going to be better on PlayStation 5. I don't know if that argument makes sense. So,

16:54.600 --> 17:00.040
DarkSakura, what's your take on backwards compatibility? I know, if I'm not mistaking,

17:00.040 --> 17:06.920
you and Dan and your household is not opting into the new generation yet, right? No PS5 or Xbox

17:06.920 --> 17:15.480
X for you guys, right? Yet? No, we're really not thinking about doing that anytime soon,

17:15.480 --> 17:20.600
just because we got shit we don't play already. And you know what? That's totally fair. There's

17:20.600 --> 17:24.600
going to be a lot of people that don't upgrade right away, and it doesn't make you guys any less

17:24.600 --> 17:31.640
gamers. It's fine. Hell, the way the world is right now, the money thing alone is a barrier

17:31.640 --> 17:37.960
for many people, and we all get that. But anyway, let me ask you a hypothetical. If you were going

17:37.960 --> 17:42.680
to be looking into PlayStation 5 and that whole thing, how much does the backwards compatibility

17:42.680 --> 17:46.440
factor, especially since, you know, DarkSakura, you're kind of the queen of the classic and the

17:46.440 --> 17:51.400
retro here on this show, how much does the backwards compatibility stuff weigh in for you?

17:55.480 --> 18:02.280
Not really at all, because I mean, I have the systems. I mean, that's the thing. I have the

18:02.280 --> 18:11.800
systems. I don't need backwards compatibility. However, thinking in terms of the, I hate to say

18:11.800 --> 18:20.600
the average gamer, you know, they may not have that, those older systems, they may not have been

18:20.600 --> 18:27.080
a collector or have the capability to keep field systems, maybe traded it in to get the new thing,

18:27.080 --> 18:34.040
and they have all this library of old games. So it would make sense that they would want

18:35.320 --> 18:41.400
to maximize that for their user base, all of these companies, and of course, Sony themselves,

18:41.960 --> 18:47.880
but that's logic. And they think with the bottom line, you know, if they can get people to rebuy

18:47.880 --> 18:55.720
things, then that's all better for them. I don't know. I mean, I'm also coming from, I guess,

18:55.720 --> 19:03.000
a little bit of an old school thought with that, you know, that if, you know, when we got our

19:04.120 --> 19:10.760
Super Nintendos, we didn't expect them to play NES games, did we? When we got our N64,

19:10.760 --> 19:15.240
we didn't expect it to play our SNES games. When I got my Dreamcast, I didn't expect it to play

19:15.240 --> 19:21.160
Saturn games. So backwards compatibility is a little, it's a lot more of a new concept,

19:21.160 --> 19:29.560
I would say, in terms of gaming, that it's a bonus that isn't required to be there.

19:29.560 --> 19:34.680
Now the people have come to expect it. Yeah. I mean, I agree with that to an extent,

19:34.680 --> 19:38.120
because we did have, even though Nintendo, you're right, Nintendo did set that standard with the

19:38.520 --> 19:43.800
TV consoles, they had the opposite standard when it came to the handhelds. Game Boy Advance did

19:43.800 --> 19:48.600
play Game Boy games, Game Boy, or excuse me, DS played Advance games, et cetera, et cetera. So,

19:48.600 --> 19:54.440
I mean, I get it. It's sometimes there, sometimes not. So it's not totally fair to expect it as a

19:54.440 --> 19:59.800
reality, but maybe it's also a sign of, and I don't know, maybe it's a sign of how much PC

19:59.800 --> 20:05.240
gaming has started to come in a little bit. And I include Mac, all computers, and phones really

20:05.240 --> 20:11.240
with that too, where the backwards compatibility thing isn't even a question because you increment

20:11.240 --> 20:15.080
little pieces or you go to a new operating system or whatever, and the old stuff kind of works.

20:15.080 --> 20:17.720
So I think it's interesting. Not always.

20:17.720 --> 20:23.720
Okay. Yeah. Okay. With some exception. And for example, when they did several rereleases,

20:23.720 --> 20:29.800
and I'm not talking about the Windows 3.1 days, I'm talking about just Windows 95 even,

20:30.760 --> 20:34.040
you know, going me edition, you know, whatever was past that.

20:34.680 --> 20:37.560
No, you're... Sorry. Go ahead.

20:38.520 --> 20:43.400
But, you know, more I'd say in like the modern era of say Windows gaming, there are still

20:43.400 --> 20:48.200
ones for pre-Windows 7 that will not run without emulation.

20:49.880 --> 20:54.520
Fair. Because you're right. There is that whole, it's the 32-bit, 64-bit thing. And that came into

20:54.520 --> 20:59.400
play on iOS and I think Android as well. For example, Flappy Bird doesn't play on

20:59.400 --> 21:04.760
the newest iPhones because Flappy Bird, you know, the guy stopped making it and he pulled it and

21:04.760 --> 21:11.000
it is not 64-bit or whatever it is. So it doesn't work. And that happened with Windows stuff too,

21:11.000 --> 21:15.800
is that, you know, the newest Windows will not necessarily play all the old stuff stable.

21:15.800 --> 21:21.560
So, okay, fair. You got me there. Although it is interesting where a lot of times the

21:22.280 --> 21:26.600
hacking, cracking archivist community, I shouldn't lump all those things in together, but

21:27.240 --> 21:33.000
the community that really works to preserve archivism, we'll say, finds these workarounds,

21:33.000 --> 21:38.200
right? You can play classic DOS games on archive.org and so forth because people figure

21:38.200 --> 21:44.760
out a way to get around it, right? So there is that. Exactly. Let's see. sj100matt says,

21:44.760 --> 21:50.840
folks hiked PS1 through 4 backwards compatibility on 5 even though Sony never really said that they

21:50.840 --> 21:58.600
were guilty. But I guess maybe after seeing Sony sell PlayStation 1 and 2 games on PlayStation 4

21:58.600 --> 22:04.200
and so you knew it worked, you kind of hoped it would be there, but all right, fine. Anyway,

22:04.200 --> 22:07.160
let's see. Some other comments on backwards compatibility. It's a nice thing, you know.

22:07.880 --> 22:14.760
I'd say it's not entirely a major requirement, you know? But it's nice. I think it's something

22:14.840 --> 22:18.680
that they do to keep their user base loyal. That's my thought.

22:19.480 --> 22:23.560
no1special77 in chat says, even if you have the older systems, there are folks that want

22:23.560 --> 22:27.320
backwards compatibility because they'd rather have one machine that plays both

22:27.320 --> 22:32.200
newer and older stuff rather than multiple systems hooked up, which can lead to a cluster fuck of

22:32.200 --> 22:37.320
wires. That is me. I would love nothing more. Actually, you know what I think one of the

22:37.320 --> 22:41.400
coolest systems ever was? And Dark Soccer did a spotlight on it years ago when there was the

22:41.400 --> 22:47.800
classic system of the month, but it was that Panasonic cube that did GameCube and DVDs.

22:48.360 --> 22:53.320
So you could, or was it DVDs or something? But so you could have it all in one. So I would love

22:53.320 --> 23:00.680
nothing more than like a Play Xbox Switch that does everything. I would love that. I know it's

23:00.680 --> 23:07.880
not going to happen, but. Or what was, we have the, oh God, what is it? That player that also

23:07.960 --> 23:15.720
plays Sega Genesis games. You know, I still have my tech and BLEAM. Actually,

23:15.720 --> 23:20.920
I got all the BLEAM casts. I wonder if like I could get a dollar for it.

23:22.600 --> 23:27.960
I don't even know if he could get that. Let's see. Bobby says I have a BLEAM t-shirt still.

23:27.960 --> 23:32.360
I have a sticker. Wow. Let's see. Quest Buster says I managed to get a splitter that allowed

23:32.360 --> 23:37.000
my Nintendo and Sega consoles to share an RF adapter. It was great, but the back of the TV

23:37.000 --> 23:45.720
was like elder God tentacles. And Brakeman says I dream of a future with no cables. It's coming.

23:45.720 --> 23:52.440
It's coming because now a lot of the Bluetooth can send a lot of that stuff. Because Alan will

23:53.000 --> 23:59.560
watch Twitch on his phone and he beams it to the TV. There's no native Twitch app on the TV. So he

23:59.560 --> 24:04.280
watches Twitch from his phone on the TV and he does that through like Bluetooth. So, I mean,

24:04.280 --> 24:10.040
I don't know if the... That being said, the item to which you're streaming must also be

24:10.040 --> 24:14.760
capable of the same quality of the device you're streaming from. Sure. Oh, yeah, of course. Of

24:14.760 --> 24:21.240
course. And I don't know if like lag and everything is like it's one thing for movies and TV. It's

24:21.240 --> 24:25.400
another when you're actually playing a game, especially like a music based game or something.

24:25.400 --> 24:31.800
Lag. Let's invent a concept like reverse latency and, you know, or inverse latency as Google put

24:31.800 --> 24:38.280
out. Okay. So the lag may not allow for it yet, but I would say that technology is absolutely in

24:38.280 --> 24:43.880
our lifetimes that we're going to have a game console top of the, excuse me, top of the line

24:43.880 --> 24:48.360
that doesn't have wires. Well, it's going to have to plug in. So, well, maybe, no, maybe not. It

24:48.360 --> 24:53.880
would just sit on a wireless charging thing or so. Maybe not. I would say within our lifetime.

24:53.880 --> 24:59.560
TVs that actually are powered wirelessly. It's very similar to those wireless chargers, but

24:59.560 --> 25:07.080
for a longer distance. So it is possible. It's just not entirely feasible yet. That's the only

25:07.080 --> 25:12.040
way I charge my phone anymore is wirelessly because I got a dock for my car. My sister gave

25:12.040 --> 25:16.600
me a thing she bought and she couldn't use and it was actually perfect for my car. So, and it uses

25:16.600 --> 25:20.360
the wireless. You just pop it into the thing and you don't have to plug anything in or whatever.

25:20.360 --> 25:25.400
It uses the wireless charging technology. So that way it's very easy to get in and out of there. And

25:25.400 --> 25:29.880
then even when I'm charging at home, I just right by the bed, I have a little wireless pad, plop my

25:29.880 --> 25:35.480
phone on there and it charges overnight. Perfect. So, I mean, we're getting there. The brake man

25:35.480 --> 25:41.800
says, I mean, no wires, not even power cables. It's a future I dream of. Well, maybe not in

25:41.800 --> 25:47.160
five years, but I don't know. We'll see. We'll see. Anyway. All right. Any last thoughts on

25:47.160 --> 25:52.760
the Ubisoft and the backwards compatibility issue? I hope it's what I theorized a moment

25:52.760 --> 25:57.720
ago is that Ubisoft does not have the latest version of the emulator that Sony has. I'm going

25:57.720 --> 26:05.080
to really hope it's that and that it's just a miscommunication, but we'll find out in like 10

26:05.080 --> 26:13.000
days, right? We'll see. All right. Well, let's move on to a segment called How Was Your Gaming

26:13.000 --> 26:17.880
Week? And we'll start off with Dark Sakura. First off, since we had technical difficulties at the

26:17.880 --> 26:21.240
top of the show, I didn't really get to catch up with you Dark Sakura, but you mentioned that your

26:21.240 --> 26:27.720
voice was kind of iffy. So you've been a little bit under the weather, right? Oh, remember that

26:27.720 --> 26:36.760
massive headache I had last week? It was the start of pneumonia. By the way, I am getting a little

26:36.760 --> 26:43.880
bit of lag on the line, but we've had some crap going on with our internet this week. So yeah,

26:44.680 --> 26:49.480
I went in having that really nasty headache and it hasn't quite gone away. It's just hung out

26:49.480 --> 26:56.280
sort of like pressure on the back of my neck and on my head. And I started developing a little bit

26:56.280 --> 27:04.200
of a cough and it felt like my sinus infections normally do, and I have chronic sinusitis. So,

27:04.200 --> 27:09.800
I mean, that's just saying something. And so I talked to my doctor and I gave her my symptoms

27:09.800 --> 27:15.880
and she's one of the few that has accepted that my body temperature dropped after I lost all that

27:15.880 --> 27:25.960
weight. My normal is in the 97.4 range. So when I said that I hit regular normal, she's like,

27:25.960 --> 27:34.360
that's a fever for you. Okay. And so as it went, she had me have a COVID test, which I'd already

27:34.360 --> 27:38.200
had one at work, but I didn't have the results. And I don't know about those mail-in ones,

27:39.720 --> 27:45.640
but both of them came back negative. And the one at Kaiser, well, this is my medical provider,

27:45.960 --> 27:53.400
they also included the influenza. So I don't have the flu. So yay. But, excuse me.

27:54.920 --> 28:00.840
But my symptoms didn't get better. And actually starting yesterday, they got a good bit worse.

28:01.720 --> 28:09.720
And I've had to use my asthma inhaler more than I like to. So I called the advice nurse

28:10.280 --> 28:16.680
this morning. They booked me in with urgent care video, which is kind of cool that they're doing

28:16.680 --> 28:26.280
that. And the lady's like, she was so funny, this doctor, when she looked at like my allergies and

28:26.280 --> 28:30.440
the sicknesses that I'd had this year, she flat out said, Jesus Christ, girl.

28:30.440 --> 28:39.240
So I was like, right. And, you know, I said, you know, I feel like I've got my cat sitting

28:39.240 --> 28:46.920
on my chest except I am vertical. So she's like, oh, yeah. So she she's put me on some stuff,

28:46.920 --> 28:54.200
which I'm on prednisone. I'm going to be a bitch this week. Just this week? Just teasing.

28:54.840 --> 29:00.520
Just go to your house and cough on me. Well, at least I know it's not, you know,

29:00.520 --> 29:04.840
your covid negative, which is weird because you're describing all of these symptoms that

29:04.840 --> 29:10.840
really sound like covid. But it's you know, it's not. And she she does want me, however,

29:10.840 --> 29:18.040
to stay indoors as much as possible to treat it like covid, because not necessarily that I'm

29:18.040 --> 29:23.400
contagious because I am not contagious, but more that it puts me at a higher risk.

29:24.440 --> 29:30.200
And I want to say anyway, if you have a cold, if your allergies are really nasty, and I am not

29:30.200 --> 29:35.240
saying this, I'm not a doctor, don't don't take this as medical advice, but it has been advised

29:35.240 --> 29:40.600
that you take extra precautions when being around other people and consider shelter in place.

29:40.600 --> 29:44.360
Yeah. Even if your area doesn't require it. Well, and I remember that was a big thing. Remember

29:44.360 --> 29:48.360
when swine flu hit us all at O.L.R.? I gave you swine flu.

29:48.360 --> 29:53.000
Yeah. Loki, did you get it or did you somehow did you get swine flu and we all got it? No,

29:53.000 --> 29:54.360
so somehow you didn't get it. No, I don't think I did.

29:54.360 --> 29:59.000
So, OK, so I don't know if I actually gave you swine flu and if I did, I'm sorry, but it's still

29:59.000 --> 30:05.640
funny. It's whatever at this point, you know, I'm I'm still here to tell the tale. So it's one of

30:05.640 --> 30:09.560
those things where and the reason why I bring it up is I remember a big thing with that is

30:09.560 --> 30:13.880
you really had to protect yourself. And I remember when they pulled me out of work for a week,

30:13.960 --> 30:17.480
even though I was feeling fine at that point, like the symptoms were long gone.

30:17.480 --> 30:21.480
But it was all about it wasn't about me giving it to other people. It was about secondary

30:21.480 --> 30:26.280
complications coming into me because, you know, I was I was teaching classes of 30 adults at the

30:26.280 --> 30:30.680
time and you could easily catch something that could have made it a lot worse. So,

30:30.680 --> 30:34.600
well, and, you know, I didn't even have any idea that I had it until you got it

30:34.600 --> 30:37.720
because you were pretty much the only other person that I had hung around.

30:37.720 --> 30:42.120
Yeah. And I don't know where I got it from. I mean, I went to back when they were still open.

30:42.120 --> 30:47.480
I went to Sam's, the kosher deli. Yeah, it was years and years ago. So who knows?

30:48.360 --> 30:53.240
It was it was just one of those things. And now it's like, because it can stay airborne for so

30:53.240 --> 30:58.280
long and they're learning so much more about it. And I say that they should have been paying

30:58.280 --> 31:03.880
attention to the mass culture in Japan and other Asian countries because they had the right idea

31:03.880 --> 31:10.120
when you're sick, you wear the mask because you don't want to share it. And hey, people at work

31:10.120 --> 31:15.240
usually give me weird looks that if I had a cough, I was always wearing a mask, but no one

31:15.240 --> 31:19.080
around me would get sick. I thought that would be one of those things like when they talk about the

31:19.080 --> 31:24.600
new normal, what it looks like after COVID is over. I thought our culture would kind of adopt

31:24.600 --> 31:28.840
that take where like, yes, you wear a mask if you're sick. But now we have this whole problem.

31:28.840 --> 31:33.400
And I don't want to go down this path here tonight. But you all know there's the anti-mask

31:33.400 --> 31:37.880
movement and that whole thing. Right. So I don't know if that's really going to be there or not,

31:37.880 --> 31:42.680
but I don't know. It's going to be interesting. Speaking of COVID though, I will say real fast

31:42.680 --> 31:47.320
and I will thank again, you guys know I'm on the last episode of OLR, Shane was here. So I'm sure

31:47.320 --> 31:52.200
some of y'all are curious how he is doing. And if he's in chat, please speak up and speak for

31:52.200 --> 31:57.160
yourself, sir. But last I talked to him, he's doing a lot better. So that's yay, good news.

31:57.720 --> 32:02.040
But he does say some symptoms are still lingering. I think he said it was like, I'm at 85%

32:02.840 --> 32:09.480
and the doctor says that some of these symptoms can go on for a long time. Like he might be short

32:09.480 --> 32:17.720
that 15% for months, which is really unfortunate. But I believe he has said to me something along

32:17.720 --> 32:22.840
the lines of he'd rather have that than a hospital visit. So and I imagine if I had

32:22.840 --> 32:28.760
COVID that my take on that would be very, very similar. So interesting take on the mask thing

32:28.760 --> 32:34.280
in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network, as Joe and under Matt says, I for sure want to wear a

32:34.280 --> 32:40.120
mask at conventions. Act Def says yeah, with the swine flu, it was more about getting worse by

32:40.120 --> 32:45.800
catching something else. And I think I've talked about this several years ago. But I actually lost

32:45.800 --> 32:52.200
a friend and she was only 24. And I did lose her to swine flu. It was a very different situation

32:52.200 --> 32:58.280
from what we're dealing with now with COVID. But she caught it very early. She was in with

32:58.280 --> 33:04.200
the whole thing. She was in Vegas for a mutual friend's 21st birthday. And look,

33:04.200 --> 33:08.520
y'all know what happens in Vegas on people's 21st birthdays. I don't got to get into detail,

33:08.520 --> 33:13.000
but it would be very easy to probably catch something. But what happened to her is that,

33:13.000 --> 33:17.560
you know, she had swine flu, she was the first person in the entire county where we live to have

33:17.560 --> 33:22.360
it. And then she caught something secondary. And that's what and it was so early on that they

33:22.360 --> 33:25.880
didn't really I don't think they knew that that's what was happening. And that's why people were

33:25.880 --> 33:31.720
passing. And then by the time she actually passed on the anniversary of this show, June 23rd.

33:32.840 --> 33:37.000
So not to be a downer, but it's the reality of the situation. But by the time-

33:37.000 --> 33:38.680
I lost friends with COVID.

33:38.680 --> 33:43.640
Yeah, yeah. By the time October came around, which I think was the timeframe you and I got it,

33:43.640 --> 33:49.800
maybe it was November, October, November, it was like doctors knew what to do. They knew to give

33:49.800 --> 33:53.400
out the Tamiflu to prevent a secondary infection. They knew what to do better. And that's what's

33:53.480 --> 33:59.720
made this whole COVID thing a little bit scary is that they really still aren't sure how to treat it.

33:59.720 --> 34:05.640
And I think some people had a lot of hope when you know who the big one got, you know,

34:05.640 --> 34:10.280
COVID and had that whole Regeneron thing. But now they're even saying it just came out this week.

34:10.280 --> 34:15.160
Regeneron is probably not like they canceled the trial of that or put it on hold or something.

34:15.160 --> 34:18.680
It's probably not what they thought it was. So that's what made that they still don't

34:18.680 --> 34:20.760
really know how to treat it. And that's an issue.

34:21.720 --> 34:26.200
The thing that people like my mother don't seem to understand is that like,

34:26.200 --> 34:29.720
oh, they keep putting out something new every day. Well, that's fucking science.

34:29.720 --> 34:30.520
Yeah, that's science.

34:31.400 --> 34:36.680
When science finds out that it's wrong, it does the opposite of what all of these anti-massacre

34:36.680 --> 34:43.400
people do and actually learns and puts out new evidence and says, hey, we were wrong about this.

34:43.400 --> 34:51.320
Stop doing this. Here is the right thing. It's integrity. Science has to have that kind of

34:51.320 --> 35:02.040
integrity to be what it is. I mean, it's always changing. I'm trying to think, like 20 years ago,

35:02.600 --> 35:06.680
we thought dinosaurs were big lizards and now we know they're giant chickens.

35:07.400 --> 35:15.080
Yes. I mean, imagine living in a time frame when you realize, thanks to science, that this whole

35:15.080 --> 35:20.600
time the earth is actually round. It's now been signed. Of course, some people still haven't

35:20.600 --> 35:25.880
figured that out, I suppose. But for the most part, we all agree the earth is round because

35:25.880 --> 35:30.920
science has proven that. Right. So, you know, you're right. Science does change. We find new

35:30.920 --> 35:36.280
things, you know, the periodic table of elements. Sometimes we find new elements. It's exciting.

35:37.160 --> 35:42.280
I mean, it's certainly not the thing that we had in science class and, you know, back in the day

35:42.280 --> 35:48.760
when we were, you know, not before I was so decrepit. All right. Anyway, it's not to be

35:48.760 --> 35:53.400
too tangenty, but it happens here on OLR sometimes. Back to gaming weeks. Let's talk

35:53.400 --> 35:56.920
about our gaming weeks. Dark soccer. How was your gaming week? Well, of course, there was

35:56.920 --> 36:05.160
Animal Crossing, but I did a completely different kind of game. Ooh. Yeah. And hey, if you can talk

36:05.160 --> 36:14.200
about Survivor, I can talk about GISH. Shout out to Karen if she's still out there. Yeah. So GISH

36:14.760 --> 36:24.760
is the, it stands for the Great International Scavenger Hunt. And it was arranged by Misha

36:24.760 --> 36:31.000
Collins, who played Castiel on Supernatural, who is honestly a very decent human being, a really,

36:31.080 --> 36:35.720
really good person. I think that show's been on since they thought the earth was flat, right?

36:35.720 --> 36:41.720
That show's been on forever. Three episodes left, Rob. Okay. But it's been on forever. I'm not,

36:41.720 --> 36:48.840
like, stop making me want to cry. I'm sorry, but it has been on forever. So nice. Even if they're

36:48.840 --> 36:54.920
like, we could just keep doing this or we could stop on a high note. So yeah, but at any rate,

36:55.640 --> 37:02.760
it's, and this one was a mini hunt. It was just over a weekend, but usually it's over a whole

37:02.760 --> 37:08.440
week and you're given a list and they add stuff to the list during the week to just keep challenge

37:08.440 --> 37:16.280
going. But you're awarded certain points for certain crafting things, right? So, and now that

37:16.280 --> 37:22.120
the thing is over, I can actually show some of the things I worked on. Just real quick, I'm going to

37:22.200 --> 37:29.080
step away. I have to deal with a smoosh situation. I'll be right back. Keep talking and move on to

37:29.080 --> 37:36.760
Loki if I'm not back in time. All right. So, so basically what I, you know, it's different

37:36.760 --> 37:41.320
crafting things. Sometimes it's baking, sometimes it's makeup. A lot of the different things in

37:41.320 --> 37:47.400
there are going to be things like charity work. Like one of the things on there that I desperately

37:47.400 --> 37:53.000
wanted to do was get my neighbors to contribute food to a food bank so that I could deliver it

37:53.000 --> 38:03.080
and do a picture of me delivering it. But I have the Lurgee, so that was out. So, you know,

38:04.120 --> 38:08.760
they're like, I have some pictures up here and I'm going to go ahead and link them in the chat room,

38:08.760 --> 38:20.280
but it's on my Twitter at DarkSakura, S-A-K-U-R-A. So, one of the challenges was to make a gory

38:20.280 --> 38:28.360
pastry so that when you cut it, it oozes blood. And so I made little strawberry hand pies, but

38:29.240 --> 38:36.840
I had like a different, what's the word I'm thinking, rehydrated strawberries from

38:36.840 --> 38:41.080
freeze-dried strawberries so that they kind of had this gummy texture to it. And I have that

38:41.080 --> 38:49.000
seeping out of the little pocket pie. And then another one had to be a villain from a horror

38:49.000 --> 38:57.400
movie cutting out coupons at the kitchen table. So I did Sadako. Yeah, you should see the pictures.

38:57.400 --> 39:01.160
And I'll put up my other one because I misread that it had to be at the kitchen table. So I had

39:01.160 --> 39:07.160
to redo my initial picture, but Dan took one of me in front of a static TV. So that was pretty

39:07.160 --> 39:13.400
funny. But yeah, this one I had to do by myself because he wasn't here. So it's one of my black

39:13.400 --> 39:20.360
wigs backwards and wearing like the leftovers from my Project Nunway outfit. And then, you know,

39:20.360 --> 39:27.960
I had to pull some junk mail out to do it. And then another one was, if you have a friend that

39:27.960 --> 39:33.160
lives far away, it's doing it like a cheer up jar for their mental health. And Becky moved

39:33.160 --> 39:39.800
really far away for me. I mean, I have a difficult time getting out to see her. So I took these

39:39.800 --> 39:45.080
little Maneki Neko cards that I had and put like a different, you know, like, hey, remember to

39:45.080 --> 39:50.360
breathe, drink your water. On my picture I have, ugh, is a valid emotion. And another one says,

39:50.360 --> 39:56.120
make today your bitch, you're lovely, you lovely hurricane. I added in some chocolate and some of

39:56.120 --> 40:03.720
those C's lollipop minis. And there's also another letter in there that's like the open on a really,

40:03.720 --> 40:10.200
really terrible day. And since Becky did come over last night, since I wasn't contagious or anything,

40:10.200 --> 40:13.480
I was able to give it to her in person. And another one was-

40:13.480 --> 40:15.640
I didn't know she moved. You said she moved?

40:16.520 --> 40:18.520
Well, yeah, she moved out to Carmichael.

40:18.520 --> 40:19.240
Oh, I didn't know that.

40:19.960 --> 40:22.280
Yeah. But for me where I am, that's-

40:22.280 --> 40:22.760
Yeah.

40:22.760 --> 40:25.240
That's just, look, she bought her grandparents' house.

40:25.240 --> 40:25.960
Oh, nice. Okay.

40:27.160 --> 40:34.600
So the other one, instead of Elf on a Shelf, we did Ghoul on a Stool. And since ghouls look like

40:34.600 --> 40:38.840
humans in the supernatural universe, I took one of my ball-jointed dolls and put her in a chair

40:38.840 --> 40:45.480
on a stool holding a knife. So, I mean, those are some of the examples. You know, I also wrote a

40:45.480 --> 40:51.000
Black Lives Matter haiku. I'll put that up as well. I did it, you know, and I made it look like

40:51.000 --> 40:59.400
one of those inspirational quote things. But yeah, it's really good. Like one person did,

40:59.400 --> 41:07.000
like, they had this, like, the Gish Mystery House type of thing. And it started off with

41:07.000 --> 41:10.520
Misha and his son West at the Winchester Mystery House, you know, doing a flashlight tour

41:11.320 --> 41:14.520
with clues. And one of the big clues was, like, another thing that we had to do. And it

41:15.320 --> 41:19.000
was, like, using, like, code 13, but then on different lines and everything. It was pretty

41:19.000 --> 41:24.520
cool. So someone had to build an expansive mansion in honor of the Winchester Mystery House

41:24.520 --> 41:30.760
at a gingerbread. And someone did it. And I was actually on the live call where one of these

41:30.760 --> 41:35.640
people presented it. It was absolutely amazing. I mean, it's, like, worth 130 points. The biggest

41:35.640 --> 41:43.000
thing that I did was a video of myself casting a spell to revive my inner child that, of course,

41:43.000 --> 41:49.720
didn't work because my inner child never died. So it's really good. And, of course, he's also

41:50.440 --> 41:57.880
on the board for Random Acts.org. And so they have, like, a fundraiser right now through

41:57.880 --> 42:04.120
GoFundMe to change a life. And so, of course, challenges involve donating to that and getting

42:04.120 --> 42:08.840
10 other people not in your team to donate to that. I was on a team, by the way, me doing a team

42:08.840 --> 42:17.720
effort. Go fig. But it was really good. It felt good to do something. And on top of that, it was

42:17.720 --> 42:26.520
all perfectly socially distant friendly. It was little ways for people to be a part of things.

42:26.520 --> 42:33.880
Now, when you sign up for it, you have two tiers. There is a $19 tier that's just, you know,

42:33.880 --> 42:39.160
do the hunt. You're buying into it. And it's a fundraiser. It's for a good cause.

42:40.600 --> 42:47.080
I actually, since this is going to be my first one and I wanted to do something really good,

42:47.080 --> 42:55.320
I did the $99 tier. Well, because I also got bonus and reasons. I just have-

42:55.320 --> 42:57.560
You don't have to just... It's your money. Spend it how you want.

42:58.200 --> 43:02.760
Yeah. But most of the time, I don't have that to do. So it felt really good to do it. And I'm

43:02.760 --> 43:10.440
going to get a bunch of goodies in the mail, so whatever. But it was... I got to meet new people.

43:10.440 --> 43:16.360
I have two new Facebook buddies out of it. And it's people all over the country and the world,

43:16.360 --> 43:26.200
really, who are coming together for a common cause to have fun together and ultimately to be kind.

43:27.160 --> 43:34.360
And that to me... And it's something that they've been quoting from Biden is that... And I'm not

43:34.360 --> 43:40.600
trying to sway anybody, but in voting, empathy is on the line. The character of the nation is on the

43:40.600 --> 43:50.440
line. And if we can start individually, each one of us just doing different little kind things

43:50.680 --> 43:56.920
during the day. Even if it's telling a stranger they have a cute shirt.

43:57.800 --> 43:58.520
But six feet away.

43:59.400 --> 44:04.840
At six feet away, yes. Or like today when I was leaving the pharmacy to get my meds,

44:04.840 --> 44:09.320
there was a security guard just sitting by herself kind of forlornly looking out the window. And I

44:09.320 --> 44:13.960
stopped across the desk. It was actually a good six foot distance. And I just asked her how she

44:13.960 --> 44:19.880
was doing today. Hope she had a great rest of her weekend. And she lit up. And for some people,

44:19.960 --> 44:24.760
that's all it takes. If you have an elderly neighbor in your neighborhood,

44:25.400 --> 44:28.920
bake cookies and take it to them unless they're diabetic and then bring them chicken.

44:30.440 --> 44:36.520
But there's different things that you can do. And I absolutely suggest checking out randomax.org

44:36.520 --> 44:44.840
and checking out GISH. I think it's GISH.org, G-I-S-H. But definitely check them out. Run by

44:44.840 --> 44:52.120
amazing people. All of them. And it's a lot of fun. And you get to flex your creative muscles.

44:52.120 --> 44:55.960
And the community is just really, really supportive and really wonderful. Even if

44:55.960 --> 45:03.000
you're on a different team, people who did the hunts in previous years will give you great

45:03.000 --> 45:08.520
advice. They're absolutely amazing. And then Animal Crossing. That's my favorite.

45:08.520 --> 45:10.520
Of course. Of course. All right. Loki, how about you?

45:10.520 --> 45:13.240
And I did play Pirates of the Caribbean pinball finally.

45:13.240 --> 45:14.600
Oh, where at?

45:14.600 --> 45:16.440
It's pretty at my house.

45:16.440 --> 45:18.600
Oh, not lucky. Nice.

45:18.600 --> 45:20.120
Dan sold a few tables for it.

45:20.120 --> 45:21.880
Ah, OK. Nice.

45:21.880 --> 45:28.520
And we just picked up Monster something. I don't think it's one of the Elvira ones.

45:28.520 --> 45:32.840
It's like, I think it's Monster Mash or something. So we just got that anyway.

45:33.400 --> 45:35.720
All right. We'll move on to Loki. Loki, how was your gaming week?

45:37.480 --> 45:40.680
Non-existent, really. Because like I said, I've been working on my game mostly.

45:41.080 --> 45:45.960
I played a little bit of Orna, but that's pretty much it was just that.

45:47.480 --> 45:49.640
But yeah, I really wish I could tell you what I was working on.

45:50.280 --> 45:53.400
Have video already. I can't show you. So I'm sorry.

45:53.400 --> 45:57.400
Why not? I'm starting to get on Bobby's side with this. Why not?

45:57.400 --> 45:59.080
The only person stopping that is you.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.680
That's where you're wrong. So.

46:03.720 --> 46:10.360
Oh, OK. Interesting. All right. All right. Well, OK. So you've been working on your game.

46:10.360 --> 46:15.240
We're waiting for that. All right. So my gaming week. So a lot of stuff that I usually play,

46:15.240 --> 46:19.960
you know, I was I was I was out doing Ingress. I was doing my my cemetery creeping today.

46:19.960 --> 46:25.480
And I realized pretty early on today was a bad day to do the portal scanning because oops,

46:25.480 --> 46:33.160
today also happens to be Dia de los Muertos. And so the cemetery I went to, because my genius ass

46:33.160 --> 46:37.880
picked a Catholic cemetery today, it was very crowded. And so there wasn't a lot of portal

46:37.880 --> 46:42.840
scanning to be done, because while I will while I will creep at the cemetery, I'm not going to

46:42.840 --> 46:50.120
totally creep at the cemetery. So there's that act. Act is clarifying it is tomorrow and today

46:50.120 --> 46:54.520
is the day of all saints. Thank you. I suppose because it is still the weekend here, there's

46:54.520 --> 46:59.000
probably a lot of people that are using today. You know what I mean? So that whole thing. So.

46:59.000 --> 47:06.360
All right. So let's see. So I did that and I was playing Pokemon Go and I was getting infuriated

47:06.360 --> 47:12.440
by a quest line because there's a quest line that you have to get nine nice throws in a row.

47:12.440 --> 47:16.440
And you would think that isn't too hard because that's when the circle is full size. Not too bad.

47:16.440 --> 47:23.320
It was like, try it, try it, because it's it's because what happens is that the monster will jump

47:23.320 --> 47:28.360
or it'll move. And so you thought you had a nice throw and then it gets away. So I complained on

47:28.360 --> 47:35.080
Twitter. And what do you know? Complaining on Twitter works. And what I mean is somebody told

47:35.080 --> 47:39.880
me how to cheat and it works. And I'm not going to apologize for it because that task was

47:39.880 --> 47:44.520
impossible. So y'all want to know how I cheated? OK. Yeah, of course you do. OK, so here's the

47:44.520 --> 47:50.040
deal to get nine nice throws in a row. You want to build up a streak on your own like four or five.

47:50.040 --> 47:55.400
But here's what you do. Once you get to about five. Tap on the Pokemon, you're going to catch

47:56.200 --> 48:03.960
enable airplane mode, make your throw. If you get a nice throw, turn airplane mode off and reconnect.

48:03.960 --> 48:08.120
If you don't get a nice throw and you botch it, close the app immediately without turning

48:08.120 --> 48:17.320
airplane mode off. It worked. I got my nice throws in a row and I was so mad because I had a streak

48:17.320 --> 48:24.200
going. I was on like eight. But what happened is that when I went to swipe to turn, because I do

48:24.200 --> 48:29.080
the quick swipe to turn on airplane mode and the whole thing. When I did that swipe, you know what

48:29.080 --> 48:35.880
happened? I threw the pokeball instead. It was a floop and I was like motherfucker. And of course,

48:35.880 --> 48:40.120
it broke my streak because I wasn't able to turn on airplane mode. I accidentally threw the damn

48:40.120 --> 48:47.880
ball. So I was punished for cheating. OK, I was punished once, but then I got it and cheating

48:47.880 --> 48:54.680
worked. Yay. All right. So let's see. There was that. And then the other big news in my gaming

48:54.680 --> 49:02.360
world. I got my 4K TV on Friday. So I have a brand new TV. And so I was firing up some old

49:02.360 --> 49:08.360
games. Although I kind of realized like, OK, on the PlayStation 4 Pro, there actually aren't a ton

49:08.360 --> 49:13.640
of 4K games. There's just a sizable amount, but not a ton of stuff that like like not like there's

49:13.640 --> 49:18.680
stuff like in there like Call of Duty that I don't really play. But Tetris Effect is in there. So

49:18.680 --> 49:24.280
that was the first game I played in 4K was Tetris Effect. And I will say it is it is a lot. It was a

49:24.920 --> 49:31.720
sharper. And I think I'm probably noticing the HDR stuff more because the colors are a lot more

49:31.720 --> 49:36.280
vibrant than what I remember from before. And it's not and I wouldn't say it's like a huge

49:36.280 --> 49:40.200
upgrade. It's not like going from standard definition to high definition. Remember how

49:40.200 --> 49:45.400
that all blew our minds the first time? It's not quite that big of an upgrade. But I was I was

49:45.400 --> 49:50.760
still pretty I was like, OK, this is cool. And plus, my new TV is five inches bigger.

49:51.560 --> 49:57.800
And when it comes to TVs, size is everything like that. Five inches made a big difference.

49:57.800 --> 50:05.080
So I was pretty impressed with that. So, yeah. And Bobby Blackwell says, if you have God of War

50:05.080 --> 50:10.440
or Horizon Zero Dawn, those are the PS4 Pro showcase games to me. Horizon Zero Dawn is on

50:10.440 --> 50:15.560
my list to look at this week. I was like halfway through the game and then I stopped. So I'd

50:15.560 --> 50:19.880
probably have to start over because that's just how I play things. But I want to check that one

50:19.880 --> 50:26.520
out. But I am really excited for Xbox Series X coming soon, where now everything will be in 4K

50:27.080 --> 50:31.880
and the frame rate. And I'm just really looking forward to that. But that caused me to play like,

50:31.880 --> 50:38.040
did you know Sonic Mania is in 4K? I actually played that. And yes, in all its great retro

50:38.040 --> 50:46.360
pixelated glory, 4K glory. It was cool. And then what else did I play? Velocity 2X. I just randomly

50:46.360 --> 50:53.080
came across it. I just wanted to hear the music. So I played the game again. And one other thing I

50:53.080 --> 51:00.520
will mention, I don't always like to base my decision of a game off the demo, but it's the

51:00.520 --> 51:05.160
second time I'm doing it in less than a month. Because remember I played that Kingdom Hearts

51:05.160 --> 51:10.520
Melody of Memories demo and it's not good. I'm sorry. Not sorry. It's not good. Bobby

51:10.520 --> 51:15.480
Blackwell does this on his show. He based Ni No Kuni. He did that off that demo. So if Bobby

51:15.480 --> 51:20.440
can do it, I can do it. And so there's another game I played this week where I'm like, I don't

51:20.440 --> 51:25.800
know if I want to play this based off the demo. And this is really going to surprise you. You guys

51:25.800 --> 51:37.640
ready for it? Hyrule Warriors Calamity Age is not great. Sorry about it. It's as good as it

51:37.640 --> 51:43.720
would normally be on a, like, it's, it's the dinosaurs. I mean, it's as good as it normally

51:43.720 --> 51:51.160
is. My kids love it. It's not like the frame rate is not great. The pop in is really bad.

51:51.160 --> 51:56.840
The textures are not like, and it just like, honestly, when I was playing it, I was like,

51:56.840 --> 52:00.600
the original was more interesting to me when I was experiencing that for the first time.

52:00.600 --> 52:05.080
Yikes. I don't know if that's the limitations of the Switch. The game may not be fully optimized

52:05.080 --> 52:10.280
yet either. I don't know. I did appreciate that they're trying to do new things to it. It is very

52:10.280 --> 52:17.640
tied into Breath of the Wild and that lore. And it's very, very obvious. I don't think I can

52:17.640 --> 52:26.920
justify dropping $60 on it on release. So, uh oh. So, uh, yeah. So in chat, I will be picking

52:26.920 --> 52:31.160
it up because as of right now, my son is still playing. He's been playing it for like the last

52:31.160 --> 52:37.720
hour or two, um, on TV. So yeah, I'll probably pick it up. You know what? You can disagree with

52:37.720 --> 52:42.360
me. That's fine. You know what? I played Ni No Kuni and I liked it. So sometimes we're going

52:42.360 --> 52:46.600
to disagree with opinions and you will probably enjoy. There will be many people that will enjoy

52:46.600 --> 52:52.280
Hyrule Warriors and disagree with my opinion. I was just not, the demo did not excite me like I

52:52.280 --> 52:57.560
thought it would. And to be fair, uh, the whole Dynasty Warriors series has kind of gone down

52:57.560 --> 53:03.320
since 9. They've gotten really sloppy and like, it's just all over the place. So I heard the first

53:03.320 --> 53:08.120
Hyrule Warriors is pretty good. So I mean, I enjoyed it. I played a lot more of that game

53:08.120 --> 53:13.320
than you guys would think. I don't know. Maybe it's just a demo. Maybe it's early. And that's

53:13.320 --> 53:17.320
why you would want to be, I would think you'd want to put your first, your best foot forward,

53:17.320 --> 53:25.240
but you think it's in Tecmo Koei and they just do whatever they want. But, um, I don't know. Well,

53:25.240 --> 53:29.480
I'll probably pick it up either way. My kids don't care. All right. That's fine. You know what? And

53:30.120 --> 53:34.840
you know, I liked a lot of crap games when I was a kid too. I still stand by Friday the 13th on NES.

53:34.840 --> 53:41.000
It was a good game, dammit. All right. But that's my kid talking. All right. Let's move on. Let's

53:41.000 --> 53:45.160
talk about other stuff. That's it for our gaming weeks. I don't really have a lot of like housekeeping

53:45.160 --> 53:50.120
or other announcements. No time off for the foreseeable future. No time off for anybody.

53:50.120 --> 53:54.360
No, but I mean, you know, the holidays are not on Sundays this year and so forth. I don't know. I

53:54.360 --> 53:59.400
don't have any out of town trips planned. Um, cause you know, with the pandemic and all, it's,

53:59.400 --> 54:05.080
uh, not something we're doing very often. So there's that. So we'll move on. Let's get into

54:05.080 --> 54:09.640
what's going on in the gaming world right now. And we'll start with Loki. Who's going to talk about

54:09.640 --> 54:17.080
other Nintendo stuff. Direct. So, uh, we had a direct mini, uh, this week and they talked about

54:17.080 --> 54:24.120
some new games coming to the switch and some, uh, mini, uh, announcements here. So of course,

54:24.120 --> 54:28.360
one of the things they talked about was the Hyrule warriors, Age of Calamity free demo,

54:28.360 --> 54:34.920
which is out now, check it out. Game comes out on the 20th. And, um, one thing that was kind

54:34.920 --> 54:38.840
of interesting that they also talked about, which we didn't really get so much over here,

54:38.840 --> 54:44.680
but it was definitely a thing that's been in Japan and other regions is cloud streaming.

54:44.680 --> 54:51.880
So control is now out on the switch via cloud streaming, uh, assesses Crete Odyssey came out

54:51.880 --> 54:56.680
in Japan like that, where you could play the game via cloud streaming because the hardware itself

54:56.680 --> 55:03.320
can't really handle running the actual game, but it is interesting to see this being, um,

55:03.320 --> 55:06.920
offered for yet another game. I would hope that would seem more kind of come that way.

55:07.560 --> 55:14.760
Um, they showed off some more of, um, immortals Phoenix rising, running on the switch. Uh,

55:14.760 --> 55:19.960
they talked about bravely default, uh, which is now coming out February 26th,

55:19.960 --> 55:26.920
briefly default two, I should say, um, story of seasons is getting a sequel on the switch,

55:26.920 --> 55:33.800
a story of seasons, pioneer of pioneers of all of coming out March 23rd. Uh, they talked about

55:33.800 --> 55:39.560
no more heroes three, which is going to be coming out sometime, uh, next year. And then also, uh,

55:39.560 --> 55:45.000
no more heroes one and two, um, are out now on the switch. So that was kind of a surprise

55:45.000 --> 55:49.560
announcement as well. Uh, hit man three is also going to be coming, uh, to the switch

55:49.560 --> 55:57.560
also with that cloud streaming. So that's also very interesting. Um, a game made by how laboratory

55:57.560 --> 56:05.640
called part-time UFO, which I believe was a port of a mobile game is coming out soon. I think it's

56:05.640 --> 56:12.920
already out. And, uh, what else? Uh, Tropico six coming to, uh, the switch getting important for

56:12.920 --> 56:21.880
that, uh, uh, surviving it aftermath coming spring 2021. That's also another port. And in Grifflands

56:21.880 --> 56:26.920
sometime next summer is when that's coming out. And so, and they said, this is the last one of

56:26.920 --> 56:32.280
the year, right? So there's no more, no more announcements for 2020 after this. So, and in fact,

56:32.280 --> 56:38.200
a lot of this stuff was for 2021. So, um, that's, that's it. So I got to say Nintendo's holiday

56:38.840 --> 56:43.400
is, I mean, we knew this was going to be the case, but Nintendo's holidays looking a little thin.

56:43.400 --> 56:47.000
Um, but I don't think that's going to stop the switch from selling. And I think

56:48.040 --> 56:52.760
with the pandemic and everything going on, it's a understandable. And B I think they're,

56:52.760 --> 56:56.840
they're going to be fine. I think they're still going to sell a ton of switches, just people that

56:57.800 --> 57:01.560
extra one or a new one for their household. So they can play animal crossing for the first time

57:01.560 --> 57:05.960
or the impressive library of games that switch already has. So I don't think Nintendo is exactly

57:05.960 --> 57:10.120
going to struggle, but I think there's a lot of fans that are like, ah, I was hoping for

57:10.120 --> 57:14.920
something a little bigger than maybe, you know, a new Hyrule warriors and some Wii U ports. Oh,

57:14.920 --> 57:18.600
and a new Pikmin, I guess just came out this week, but that's also not for everybody. Right.

57:19.320 --> 57:24.920
So, yeah. Yeah. All right. Um, I mean, Pikmin releases came, they really have, I mean,

57:25.320 --> 57:31.720
come on, give, give some of the other series, some love F zero earthbound. All right. Uh,

57:31.720 --> 57:37.320
but, uh, I would, I would say that the control thing was pretty surprising in the cloud gaming.

57:37.320 --> 57:42.760
Have they, I guess they have done that here in the U S right. One of the resident evils they

57:42.760 --> 57:48.520
did on the cloud gaming, didn't they? But yeah, seven, I thought, um, or yeah, seven,

57:49.160 --> 57:54.280
didn't they bring it? I thought that was in, I can't remember some are only in Japan and I know

57:55.080 --> 57:59.000
that this has been the thing in Japan for a little bit because we were kind of commenting on it that

57:59.000 --> 58:03.000
like, oh, that's interesting. And I wonder when they'll bring that over here. Well, here we go.

58:03.000 --> 58:07.480
Now we're seeing it with control. Um, okay. So Bobby has confirmed me. This is the first time

58:07.480 --> 58:12.760
that the U S has had streaming for switch. So I I'm crossing the wires in my head and I, I gave

58:12.760 --> 58:17.560
the resident evil thing, a U S release when we didn't actually have one. Um, but I do want to

58:17.560 --> 58:23.400
say, uh, dark Tetsuya was talking about that demo of control saying it's only the first 15 minutes,

58:23.400 --> 58:27.560
but it seemed to play just fine, but that's actually really good because that also kind

58:27.560 --> 58:32.840
of lets you gauge, is this going to work for me or not? And so you can kind of see if that cloud,

58:32.840 --> 58:37.080
as I've actually think that's a really cool, uh, thing that they did to do that demo,

58:37.080 --> 58:42.680
to allow you to see is streaming going to work for you. So, so I wonder how far away are we from,

58:42.680 --> 58:50.120
uh, X cloud support on the switch. You're not the first to suggest that I, I would be so

58:50.120 --> 58:55.160
curious if that is really a thing. I know Microsoft would do it. I know they would,

58:55.160 --> 59:01.720
but it would Nintendo. That's the huge question mark. Uh, we'll see, uh, orange right in chat

59:01.720 --> 59:06.360
says I did try it out a little bit just to see if it will work on my connection. It did. Uh,

59:06.360 --> 59:10.440
they've been doing cloud games in Japan, assassin's creed, one of them, uh, those,

59:10.440 --> 59:14.440
that comment again from orange right in our chat over at twitch.tv slash a fog network.

59:14.440 --> 59:18.360
So the cloud gaming thing is, is very interesting and you're right. It's, it's going to open the

59:18.440 --> 59:25.160
door to other things. I mean, you, you say X cloud, but we could also maybe have Luna

59:25.160 --> 59:33.880
on the Nintendo platform. We could have, um, uh, stadia, LOL, maybe, uh, why not tell, tell me,

59:33.880 --> 59:38.600
I can think of more reasons why yes than why no, especially from a technical perspective at this

59:38.600 --> 59:44.360
point. So we'll see what happens. It'd be very interesting. I'll be curious if Nintendo wants

59:44.360 --> 59:49.160
to adopt this streaming thing in their own games. That's what I'm really curious about.

59:49.800 --> 59:54.200
We'll see, like offer them on other platforms outside of the switch. No, uh,

59:55.080 --> 01:00:00.360
deliver other technical experiences and other things via cloud-based gaming,

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:06.360
like allowing them to push what the system can do even further through the cloud. Perhaps when

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:12.200
switch pro becomes a reality that a person with a regular switch could still experience switch pro

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:17.640
games. Thanks to the magic of the cloud. I, I it's a tall order from Nintendo who sometimes

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:24.280
seems to lag behind, but Nintendo also has this random ability to get these random things right

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:30.040
on the money. For example, making a bang up AR game. That's a really impressive show of the

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:36.280
technology with that Mario cart game. Who would have thought? It is. Nintendo would do it, but

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:44.520
okay. I have a feeling it's going to go the way the lab. Oh, like it. It's fun for awhile. And

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:49.480
then you stop playing it. And that's the whole reason I didn't get it. I knew it would be fun

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:55.640
for five minutes, but that's it. But, but you have kids. Don't you think the kids will be into it

01:00:55.640 --> 01:01:07.400
longer? No, they don't want to set it up. So it's, it's fun and we could, I'm sure they'd still

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:11.480
want to play it once in a while, but it's like, it's not really engaging. It's not like something

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:17.400
that they would want to come back to all the time. They have trouble like setting it up. They don't

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:25.960
know how to like unfold the gates and everything, but, um, I mean, it's cool. I just, I think it's

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:31.080
going to get pushed by the wayside eventually, at least it folds down to a very small package.

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:36.520
And not unlike the, uh, lab stuff, which is just, well, was littered all over my house. I've

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:42.040
literally, I think I have thrown away some of the VR stuff, um, because it's just like, I'm not

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:46.200
going to play it. Uh, dark soccer. I'm sorry. What were you saying about Mario cart? You jumped in

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:49.720
there was something I wouldn't say anything about Mario cart. Oh, what did you say? Oh, okay. I

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:56.600
missed it. Sorry. I just said hard. Same. Oh, okay. I was agreeing with, with you about not

01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:03.400
buying Labo because we knew it was going to be a waste. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Um, let's move on.

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:10.040
Let's talk about, um, things besides just Nintendo, uh, kind of a follow up, I guess, to another issue

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:15.000
that's been going on with the whole Twitch and the copyright crackdown and so forth. We're seeing

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:21.320
more and more games allow you to turn the music off, uh, or disable that element of the game so

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:27.880
that you can get around those types of issues on Twitch. Uh, and the game in question is FIFA 21.

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:32.920
Now this is notable because if I'm not mistaken, FIFA 21 is the biggest game in the world, right?

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:39.160
In the world. Okay. Cause remember Madden is like a very us based thing. When we consider the world,

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:45.960
it's about soccer and that's where FIFA is really a King of that. So, uh, FIFA 21 is going to allow

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:51.240
you to disable music, to avoid the copyright infringements. There was a title update that

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:54.520
went out. So it wasn't actually in the game to begin with because the game already came out,

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:59.560
but they did not in the game. Like don't they have independent volume between sound effects

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:05.160
and music. Hasn't that been a thing that's been like in games for decades now? Like how is that

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:11.160
now a notable thing? Like I understand like, um, the ability, like what they've had, like some

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:15.400
games, I don't remember the particulars, but there's some games that have like stream safe

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:20.440
versions where it's like music that let me, let me not license music. Loki, let me jump in. Cause

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:25.000
I think, you know, I want to make sure I clarify this. So there's actually a picture of the settings

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:30.200
menu I'm looking at, and there are options for menu sound effects, volume menu, music volume.

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:35.320
So you can do that, but this option is specifically disable all music for streaming

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:40.360
purposes. So my thought is there is probably a score of sorts in FIFA 21. Like there probably

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:45.240
is incidental music, background music, and so forth that is still in the game that does not

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:52.200
get removed when you do this. So, um, this is specifically for, and it is interesting that it

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:57.080
calls out and it even shows the option with the, uh, text at the bottom streaming or recording

01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:04.120
FIFA, this setting disables all music to avoid copyright infringements. So, um, there is that.

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:08.760
So, but I will say, Loki, to your, your argument, the slider bar is also still there.

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:16.200
So, um, Bobby in chat says they use the license music for in studio sounds this, or in stadium

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:21.640
sounds rather this disables that orange, right? Says that's a really good idea. And Zen monkey

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:26.360
says, uh, Zen monkey 11 says, yes, you can lower FIFA music. Just lazy gamers, not looking at the

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:31.240
menu system. Um, orange right says, I know I'm thinking, ah, if I ever played burnout paradise,

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:36.120
that music volume is going all the way down. Yeah. And this is why usually when I play,

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:40.520
uh, these types of games I'm streaming in the, which isn't very often, I will usually stick to

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:45.640
classical music or I will have, which I has been pointed out previously. And yes, technically the

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:51.800
classical music is also because the recording itself is still something that is copyrightable,

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:56.200
but that stuff tends to not trigger strikes probably just because it is a very dear. It's

01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:02.600
not, you know, it's not lady Gaga. That's the reality, right? Um, however, I also have a tendency

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:08.360
to, when I play those games, I just keep the game audio very, very low, either through what Loki's

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:15.240
talking about, or I just keep it so low that me talking over it constantly is just, it's going to

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:20.760
make the, you can barely even hear the music. And so I, and I haven't been flagged knock on wood

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:24.120
for anything on my personal channel and VOG certainly didn't, but we definitely,

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:29.000
we don't really stream games on this, hardly ever stream games on this channel. So, um, there is

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:35.560
that. So, um, we'll see. I heard another thing, by the way, since we're on the topic of Twitch,

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:41.640
I heard another thing. I don't know if you guys have heard about this and maybe Bobby in chat,

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:47.160
cause it was in discord, but somebody mentioned that Twitch mid-rolls were suddenly back on

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:52.760
certain streams that mid-roll ads were popping in. Is anybody in our chat getting that tonight? Like

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:58.760
are ads disabled? Because I have a hunch. What's that? Cause I tried to look on, on Twitter,

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:04.120
like with the tag, like what's going on. It seems like, and I could be wrong. It seems like the

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:09.800
people that are getting hit with those mid-roll ads are using some type of ad blocker on Twitch

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:15.640
or using something to try to suppress the ads on Twitch. So Twitch is kind of like one upping it by

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:22.440
putting these ads in a different way. So yeah, it worked out well for them. Yeah. Uh,

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:26.920
pixel pocket says it seems to me like some ad blockers stopped working. Act Def says,

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:31.480
considering that like 75% of us are subbed, I'm going to say no. You're right. We are very

01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:35.240
fortunate that many of you are subscribed. Thank you for that. We're very lucky. Thank you. Thank

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:39.720
you. But surely there's a handful of people out there who are not subbed. And I'm just curious,

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:44.600
have you been getting mid-roll ads during the show? Because I watched, I watched a good hour

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:48.040
and a half of Twitch the other day. I didn't see them yet, but it might just be on certain

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:54.040
channels. I have no idea. So, uh, dark Tetsuya says I haven't seen any tonight watching on PS4.

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:57.240
I don't know how widespread it is yet, but didn't you get gifted a sub a couple of weeks ago,

01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:01.880
dark Tetsuya? You might've been. Pixelbaka says I haven't gotten any ads so far this stream. So

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:08.920
we'll, we'll see. I don't know. I, again, I have, I hope it's not back because obviously we've

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:14.760
talked a lot about why that was a bad idea and we did a whole round table on this weeks ago.

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:20.360
If you haven't watched it yet, I, this is, this is why, even though, uh, Bobby and I recorded that

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:24.840
like the day after Twitch supposedly changed their policy, there's a lot of stuff in that that still

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:30.840
holds true. So go check that out over on YouTube or over at vognetwork.com. So, all right.

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:36.360
So anyhow, uh, but as far as the current Twitch issue that we know is out there with the copyright

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:41.240
stuff, uh, you'll probably see more games that are doing this, uh, that will help you be able

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:46.760
to stream on Twitch, uh, issue free. All right, let's move on dark soccer. You have something for

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:55.880
us, right? I do. And I had to remember that I don't no longer have my, uh, mute button on my mic.

01:07:56.760 --> 01:08:03.160
So, um, I'm actually pretty excited about this and Dan actually was pretty excited too. He texted

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:13.640
me this, uh, so, um, arcade one up is, uh, doing pinball. I mean, pinball and, you know, that,

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:21.080
you know, is the magic word, uh, for me and in my house. So, um, they are doing, uh, a three quarter

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:30.200
scale, uh, pinball table, and it is going to be digital pinball. Um, there will be, um, uh, three

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:34.520
different ones that come with 10 different games. So to go ahead and start off with the first one,

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:39.320
it's Star Wars, uh, digital pinball. Then we have Marvel digital pinball and an attack from Mars

01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:45.960
digital pinball, which I used to have an attack from Mars. So the games that come with, um, each

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:51.960
set, the Marvel games, uh, pinball includes Spider-Man, Civil War, Wolverine, X-Men, Thor,

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:57.720
Marvel's Women of Power, A-Force, Ghost Rider, Venom, Fantastic Four, and Fear itself. Star Wars

01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:04.200
pinball has Boba Fett, A New Hope, Octo Island, Battle of Minbom, Darth Vader, Masters of the

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:08.440
Four, Star Wars Rebels, Han Solo, The Force Awakens, and Empire Strikes Back. That's a lot

01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:15.560
of pinball. Um, now the attack from Mars pinball is actually real pinball. So, um, it's attack from

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:21.800
Mars, Fish Tales, The Getaway, Junkyard, Medieval Madness. I mean, right now getting that from

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:27.240
Medieval Madness, you know, um, Whitewater, which is another great one, although I'm sure it's not

01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:32.440
going to come with the topper with the fan on it. Uh, Red and Ted, Fun House, which creeps me the

01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:37.400
fuck out. Um, it's kind of like a giant head on it. The ones with heads freak me out. Uh,

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:43.880
Tales of the Arabian Nights and No Good Gophers. Um, Tales of the Arabian Nights, by the way,

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:51.160
is done by John Papadook, um, who, yep, you know what else he did? World Cup soccer and Theater of

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:57.000
Magic. Makes sense. They all have like a big thing in the middle of the table. Oh yeah.

01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:01.800
But attack from Mars by itself is just a really fun one. Fish Tales is okay. We used to have a

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:09.160
getaway, um, which was a sequel to, um, great, no, I don't remember the name of the table. I

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:18.600
think I've covered the getaway. Um, I think that the, uh, that was a, uh, and I'm sorry,

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:22.520
it's going to, oh, it was High Speed 2. It was the, it was the sequel to High Speed.

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:30.200
Um, but yeah, it's, uh, it's really happy. No Good Gophers is a fun one. I love Tales of the

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:34.680
Arabian Nights. Fun House is, but it's a good table. Don't get me wrong. Whitewater is fun.

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:42.520
Medieval Madness though, um, for those who don't know, Medieval Madness recently had a re-release,

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:48.200
well, by recent, I mean, like a few years ago. We own one of the re-releases, like a special

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:52.920
edition of the re-release. Um, so it's missing like some of the branding on it and certain

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:59.400
things, but it is Attack from Mars. So these tables are going to stand, um, though they've

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:06.440
got a, uh, a 24 inch recessed screen. So it's going to be like, you're looking at it. It has

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:13.720
built an accelerometer so you can nudge and, you know, tilt if you screw up. Um, it is roughly,

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:23.240
I think three feet tall if I'm right. Um, and according to, um, uh, Arcade One Up, um,

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:31.160
on their site, it's supposed to arrive around December, 2020. Um, all of them, uh, it looks

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:36.680
like they're actually going to be sold physically through GameStop and Walmart. Um, and the Marvel

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:43.880
one apparently is already live for order at GameStop. Um, now, I mean, I, I, I'm reserving

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:49.720
judgment on the first two because clearly those are not like, and, but what I mean by legit

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:56.120
pinball is that they're not based off of legit tables, right? Right. They're the Zen pinball

01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:05.000
original creations. Yeah, exactly. But, um, the Attack from Mars one is I think the one to have

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:11.480
if you love your, your classic pinball, that would be the one that we would get. Uh, we would

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:19.240
have to move things. I'm tempted, but I don't have any more room for those machines. The burger,

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:25.960
the burger time one was enough. What? It's a little one. We got to work on the house thing

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:30.440
first, by the way, I got to do just a quick aside because people, I know you Dark Soccer and Loki,

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:35.560
you can't see my camera because of the intense tech rig that we have here at OLR. They can only

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:39.960
hear my voice. They can't see me like you guys can on Twitch, but a mysterious hand just dropped

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:46.840
this box in frame. And, uh, some folks in chat are asking, what is this? So what this is, Alan

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:54.520
just got back from Costco and he just dropped this in front of me. This is a pack of 40 Stroop waffles

01:12:54.520 --> 01:13:03.480
or Stroop waffles, if you will. 40 Costco sized box of Stroop waffles. The big one. This is big.

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:08.360
So I'm coming over. I'm not going to pay just, and my COVID test was negative. Dark Soccer is,

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:13.320
my COVID test was negative too about two weeks ago, but yes, hang out. This is, this is 40 cups

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:19.640
of coffee right here. Well, that's, you don't, you don't have to use coffee. You could use tears and

01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:28.040
that's the way you're supposed to do it. You're supposed to put it on top of a cup of coffee

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:32.920
or, you know, whatever your hot drink is that you like, and that helps soften the cookie and

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:37.640
the syrup that's in there. So there you go. And there's only, I'm looking at it, there's only 140

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:44.600
calories in one Stroop waffle. So there you go. Latest Costco find from, uh, the husband. So thank

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:50.840
you, Alan, for bringing that to my attention and so much for any weight I was trying to lose.

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:55.480
See ya. Anyway, sorry, Dark Soccer, but, um, it was Stroop waffles. It's important.

01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:59.720
Yeah. Well, at any rate though, I think that I actually already closed the article,

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:05.960
but I think they're supposed to retail for 500. Sounds about right. Yeah. Um, but yeah, um,

01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:14.040
assuming that we do end up getting one, um, I think that we're gonna, um, I'll definitely,

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:20.120
we'll do something live for, for everybody when we get ours. Um, and by the way, Rob,

01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:26.760
if you want to, I can send you my workout routine, which I'm still doing while I'm sick,

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:30.600
just a lighter one, because it involves my physical therapy. You know, it's interesting.

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:37.400
So the TV, the TV we got has all these built in things. And one of them is like a health channel

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:41.480
that has like workout videos on the man built right in the TV. And I don't know how good they

01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:47.800
are, but, um, I like my workout videos, 1980s style. I want to see those obscene,

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:51.880
like tights that people used to wear in the, like the Jane Fonda workout tapes,

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:58.280
or I'm sorry, nothing will ever, ever top Richard Simmons sweat into the oldies.

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:06.040
I used to have the Cindy Crawford workout tape. Didn't share have a workout tape at one point.

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:12.200
Sure. Does everything she's a goddess, but this I'll tell you this right now that Cindy Crawford

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:20.680
workout tape was like a kick your ass. I mean, it was hard. And the fun thing about it is that

01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:30.680
that is what got me into weightlifting when I was in high school. And, uh, after, uh, losing the

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:34.360
weight that I did, cause I was, you know, I was powerlifting before that and was building my dead

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:39.080
lift and I threw out my back. Um, I've been able to completely do my workout at home. I actually

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:44.920
wrote a blog for it, um, for, uh, Gen X geeks. Um, just, you know, putting out like what my

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:49.960
personal routine is, like what, what equipment that I have, cause it was really inexpensive

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:55.320
just to encourage everybody. So maybe. Chat, you guys are cracking me up. Uh,

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:59.720
Sia Tabiri says my grandma used to have the Angela Lansbury workout tape.

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:03.560
What? There was an Angela Lansbury workout tape. What?

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:08.280
Well I'm sure that the older crowd could make use of it.

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:14.920
So could the gays. We love murder. She wrote, come on. All right. Uh, let's see.

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:20.840
Sia Tabiri in chat says my sister and I each had one of the MTV grind tapes. Oh God.

01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:28.680
Remember when there were shows on MTV, like the grind that was just people dancing. I mean,

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:33.880
that goes back to like, it was just soul train on MTV bandstand.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.920
Is soul train still on? I think soul train is still on. It might be. I think they still do

01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:46.360
make it in the Bay. What's his face? Dio Don Cornelius. Yeah. The Bay area had some

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:51.640
local TV show that was a dance thing too, because Mel was on it like twice.

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:57.640
Soul train ended in 2006, but they do have like the soul train awards.

01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:01.720
Okay. Is Don Cornelius still alive? He'd know he died in 2012.

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:07.080
Yeah. Yeah. Anyway. All right. I used to watch soul train regularly.

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:10.360
Same. It was all that was on like Saturday morning when I was awake.

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:14.120
Right after my cartoons. It came on after my cartoons.

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:20.200
All right. Let's move on. We're running long on the show tonight. We got other topics to talk

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:26.040
about, but I know it's hard not to get derailed by Angela Lansbury and soul train. Uh, moving on,

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:32.040
uh, Oh, I got, I thought you were laughing, dark soccer, but that was coughing. I was like,

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:36.760
what's so funny? Oh, that's not funny. I felt it come. That's why I've been keeping my line

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:42.120
muted so that I wouldn't, you know, put lungs on the air. All right. Fair enough. Uh, Loki,

01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:49.480
what's next in the gaming world? So, because, um, another, I think this bit's confusing. In fact,

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:54.440
I was actually talking with Exeter on Twitter about it because he had purchased a PlayStation

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:59.960
five with a place new PlayStation five HD camera. I'm like, Oh, what's that used for?

01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:04.120
Because I don't think that's compatible with the PlayStation VR. And that's really the only thing

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:09.480
I use my camera for. And he's like, Oh, it's only for web, you know, for, um, you know,

01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:16.760
broadcasting yourself on playing games and stuff. Um, so to solve that problem, because apparently

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:20.200
the PlayStation camera that came with the PlayStation four is the only compatible with

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:25.560
the PlayStation VR. And so if you want to play PlayStation VR games on the PlayStation five,

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:29.560
you need some way to plug it in since it doesn't have the proprietary connector on the back of the

01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:33.960
PlayStation five, how are you going to do that? Well, the way you're going to do that is you go

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:41.960
to Sony's official website and you request a, um, a free cable. And the way you do that,

01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:46.920
you have to provide them with the serial number on your PlayStation VR unit and your shipping

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:52.920
information. And they will ship it to you for free. So it may take up to two weeks to get that

01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:59.800
in. Um, that kind of sucks. Although I want to say that like, it's something similar. They did

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:07.080
something similar with, um, the connect back in the day because the new systems that they made

01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:13.160
the newer slimmer models had the connect port built in, but the older original, uh, Xbox three

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:17.480
sixties did not have that. And so you had to have an adapter to plug it in that that you could

01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:25.240
request for free as well. Um, but still annoying that you have to do that. All these hoops to jump

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:29.000
through. I don't understand why the new camera, especially since it's a better camera, you would

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:35.080
think that it being a better camera might make it work better, but maybe, I guess it just doesn't,

01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:41.960
maybe it doesn't protect the dot field or whatever it needs to track stuff. Just you would think that

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:47.400
they would support something like, I don't know, but whatever. It's a hope you got to jump through

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:52.360
if you want to use, you know, the PlayStation VR and the new system. And I'm still curious what

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:58.040
like, cause I know we're getting upgrades with faster load times and all that stuff for, um,

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:02.600
the PlayStation five and playing PlayStation four games. I'm curious to see what kind of

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:06.760
enhancements we get with PlayStation VR games. Since I know with the pro, we have like higher

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:10.600
resolution and more details and stuff like that. If we're going to get something similar with,

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:14.840
uh, the PlayStation five as well, or if it's going to go even beyond what was offered with

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:18.840
the PlayStation four pro. I honestly feel like based on the comments, I guess we didn't have

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:24.120
the related story tagged. I, maybe you saw this Loki about the, the comments from the CEO on VR

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:29.480
and how it sounds like VR is kind of on, I don't want to say it's like, it's like on hold for the

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:34.360
minute. It sounds like, like they're just not really making anything for PS VR right now. And

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:38.760
that's something they're going to revisit later on the PS PlayStation, the PlayStation VR too.

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:43.000
Yeah. Which is, I mean, I don't know. I have mixed feelings on it because I'm kind of like,

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:48.040
well, if the PlayStation VR is like the number one headset right now, like keep that train rolling.

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:53.720
And it just kind of like insert another joke here about Sony really not supporting their hardware,

01:20:53.720 --> 01:21:00.280
but at the same time X files poster, I want to believe, um, that they're going to, you know,

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:06.920
maybe focus on this part of PlayStation five and getting the games there for the more traditional

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:11.960
type of media first. And then they'll kind of take a good hard look at VR later with some of

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:16.520
the leaps and bounds that, you know, the VR technology has made such as potentially,

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:21.880
you know, that PlayStation four VR has wires, wires, lots of wires, and we know that VR is

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:25.880
getting more and more to a place where there's going to be a lot less or perhaps none at all,

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:31.720
perhaps, but you know, we'll see what they decide to do. Um, so I, Loki, I would just say

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:37.560
beyond the perks of loading times on the solid state drive and what the PlayStation four pro

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:41.640
could do. I wouldn't set the bar too high. Like it's probably going to be like playing it on a

01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:47.960
PlayStation four pro. Yeah. Someone's someone needs to remind Sony that the V and PSVR does

01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:53.320
not stand for Vita. So they probably shouldn't just forget about it. Well, and my question is,

01:21:53.880 --> 01:22:00.040
okay, so Sony wants to put it on hold, but what about third-party developers? So I guess

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:04.120
if they're going to continue to make VR games, they're essentially making PlayStation four VR

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:09.400
games. Um, that would be, uh, workable through backwards compatibility, but you're probably

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:13.320
going to see a lot of developers want to, I mean, you'll probably see less and less PlayStation

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:19.160
exclusives and more games that are like, you can play it on PlayStation four VR, or you can play

01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:27.080
it on Oculus, or you can play it on, you know, HTC vibe and so forth. My assumption is when we

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:33.960
see the play, like if we had gotten a PlayStation two VR now, it probably wouldn't look very

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:40.120
different or it would be really expensive. And that's a lot to ask, put, put down $500 for a

01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:45.480
PlayStation five and another $500 for the PlayStation headset. That is a lot to ask.

01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:51.960
So I kind of understand the strategy behind, maybe we don't want to do the new VR headset this year.

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:56.920
Let's do that in a year or probably even better because of the pandemic and everything it's

01:22:56.920 --> 01:23:02.680
done to 2020. Let's do that in 2022. So that's my guess is you're going to see a PlayStation VR

01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:09.320
two in 2022. And then at that point, it will be about, well, where is the technology for VR at

01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:14.120
that point? How is that going to work into the very consumer friendly, you know, type of PlayStation

01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:20.280
VR system. But I think if Sony really wants us to believe that they're invested in it,

01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:27.560
I really want to see them make a game that is like for PlayStation VR two, not something that's

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:32.600
like enhanced or better with. I want to see that too, but I want to see them really make a game for

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:39.000
this PlayStation VR two. And I, I think that will probably be something to look forward to in 2022.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:45.320
So from that standpoint, I do kind of get what they're doing. I mean, let's be real. If they

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:50.760
were putting out a PS five VR headset now, you would not want to pay for that and a PlayStation

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:54.680
five. You're just not, some people would, of course they would, but it's not going to be

01:23:54.680 --> 01:24:00.600
enough. So I understand why they're like, we're going to wait a little bit, even though they're

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:09.640
on the top right now of the VR game. So, all right, let's move on and talk about, um, a

01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:13.400
company that I wish would get out of gaming altogether, but I'm a little bit biased, I

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:19.880
suppose. And it's Facebook. Uh, Facebook is getting into cloud gaming. Why not? Huh?

01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:25.080
Everybody, another company to join the party. You've got Stadia. You've got Luna from Amazon.

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:31.320
You've got, um, X cloud. Why not? Let's have Facebook in this as well. So now Facebook has

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:37.960
launched their own cloud gaming service. Um, but here's some, are you going to be able to play,

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:43.480
control, or are you going to be able to play, I don't know, uh, destiny or whatever the

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:53.240
no, you can play asphalt nine legends, PGA tour, golf shootout, solitaire, Arthur's tale,

01:24:53.240 --> 01:25:01.640
and mobile legends adventure, which is pretty much cookie clicker, but as, as a, uh, RPG or

01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:08.520
whatever. In other words, these are fairly mundane mobile games and look, there is a time and a place

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:14.360
for mundane mobile games. I love things like cookie clicker when I'm opening it for 30 seconds in the

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:19.240
checkout line at target or something. And then, you know, going on to whatever else is going on

01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:27.560
as far as cloud streaming though. Uh, okay. This is a weird thing to launch, but anyway, if you

01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:33.880
want to check it out, I guess you could find them in the gaming section of Facebook. Oh, by the way,

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:39.560
that's also where you'll find their, um, competitor to Twitch and that whole thing. And where mixer

01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:46.040
ended up pointing people to, um, at some point there are going to be cloud playable ads in your

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:50.920
Facebook newsfeed. So in other words, if you're not opening the gaming hub enough, as you're

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:56.440
scrolling through your Facebook feed and endlessly doom scrolling, uh, all the updates and so forth,

01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:03.880
you're going to see not just an ad, but an ad you can play live. So it'll be like a gaming ad

01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:10.360
you could just jump right into. Think about how the here's the thing. They're using it for gaming

01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:17.720
now, but think about what this is going to be when bam, you jump right into a 3d virtual house tour

01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:22.600
or you jump into, I mean, there's a lot of places I think where this technology could end up going.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:28.280
And that's what Facebook wants to get into, I suppose. So, uh, this service is also coming to

01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:33.800
the dedicated Facebook gaming app on Android. As we know, there is not a dedicated Facebook gaming

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:40.280
app on iOS because the cloud gaming and iOS have not, uh, figured that out yet. Although we are

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:47.320
seeing web based apps as a solution and perhaps that will come in the future. So, um, we'll see,

01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:53.240
but nothing to say officially on that right now. So, uh, SHO and her mat says fairly mundane,

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:59.320
much like surfing Facebook. Uh, so there you go. Uh, Zen monkey 11 said the games sound like

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:05.560
clone apps. Yeah. I I'm not exactly jumping to reactivate my Facebook account so I can play

01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:15.160
these games. Uh, I'll say that much. So anybody going to check out Facebook gaming? No. Okay. No.

01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:24.040
I, I block every game request thing that comes across my plate anyway. So I, I hate them. I

01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:29.400
don't want a game in Facebook. I don't want to play any of their shit. I don't want to give them

01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:35.560
any more money. The only reason I have a Facebook anyway, still is for my sister's stuff and for

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:41.240
the communities I'm running. So I don't want to give them any more fucking attention. Remember

01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:48.200
when the most annoying thing on Facebook was a poke is still fucking annoying. Can you still

01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:53.800
poke people on Facebook? You can still poke. I have, I was up to like 400 with one of my friends.

01:27:55.240 --> 01:28:03.000
That's a lot of poking. Well, uh, did, did they, didn't they have a thing?

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.840
When they're an app called poke at some point, it was like their Snapchat competitor or something.

01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:11.960
And it's, it's long gone. Uh, let's see sacred Jade and chat over Twitch TV slash

01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:17.640
vog network says hard pass on Facebook gaming. I deleted my Facebook profile. Congratulations.

01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:24.200
Um, I can't, I understand. I understand. I only deactivated and you know, I may go back as

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:28.840
especially, you know, after the election, I might be able to tolerate it again. We'll see. I'm

01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:33.560
practically living on Twitter these days when I was like pretty much like a not Twitter person.

01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:38.040
Twitter, Twitter is just a, it is, I get why Twitter is really annoying, but yeah,

01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:44.440
Twitter is so much more cure curatable if you know how to do it because people get really

01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:49.160
annoyed when it's like, Oh, you get your default Twitter feed that shows every, but once you learn

01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:53.080
how to really curate Twitter and make it work for you, it's, Oh my God, it's, it's great. Now

01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:56.600
it's not a perfect platform. Look at my wild at my life feed anyway. And then I check the people

01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:01.640
I care about. Yeah. Zen monkey 11 says I want my space back. Love the Twitter. So funny in there.

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:07.080
I want my space back too. I want to have, you know what? I I'm sick of this disagreeing on,

01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:13.400
on politics and that whole thing. I want the fights to be about why aren't I in your top eight?

01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:19.240
That's the fights I miss on my space. Jamie, did you have me in your top eight on my space?

01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:23.720
I hope so. You know, as a matter of fact, I did. I think I'm pretty sure I had you there too. I

01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:27.640
think I had, I think that was right. That was right around the time oil are launched. So I

01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:32.440
think I had to have you and Loki in the top eight on my space. I'd have to look for my account

01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:40.440
again, but I know that it was you and Jessica and Matt. And, uh, you know, I think my friend Risa

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:46.760
OLR had a MySpace. I know it did because we had clips of the show. I'm talking like early ass

01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:52.440
fucking clips of the show on our MySpace page. So I doubt it's there anymore. I don't know. Good

01:29:52.440 --> 01:30:02.520
luck to you if you can find it. All right. Anyway, let's move on. Uh, let's oh, oh boy.

01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:06.600
Let's follow up Facebook with a political story, but this was, this was a lot softer, right?

01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:15.720
Yeah. I mean, and it's just kind of a, a little thing. Um, basically, um, in Fortnite, Joe Biden

01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:22.600
has a map and might've covered this in the past that there was one with, um, animal crossing.

01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:27.880
There was an animal crossing town dedicated to the Biden campaign. And I'll tell you,

01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:39.400
I'll tell you what are, I mean, I, I, I vote blue, but I'm a socialist at heart and I, I am so in my

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:46.200
heart happy to see that it, you know, people embracing video games to reach that audience,

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:52.200
you know, who their people are, where all the GOP is still like, Hey, get off my lawn. Yeah. Um,

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:59.720
but anyway, um, yeah, there's a Fortnite map dedicated, uh, to, uh, to the Biden campaign and

01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:09.240
to, uh, Kamala Harris. And, um, there's like, uh, different, um, different, like, uh, TV monitors

01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:17.400
in there that have like different things like, uh, um, uh, build back better and like, uh,

01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:23.560
this one screenshot here in subway, like there's no Malarkey station and Harris highway and all of

01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:31.800
that. Um, and so, uh, but then the map is called build back better with Biden. Um, and it's

01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:39.480
supposed to educate young voters on what the democratic party stands for. Um, and then, uh,

01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:47.000
it takes you on like this adventure through this reboot city, um, where, uh, you can stay on like

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:53.880
this Island and you have many quests to do and you have to collect countless sneakers and check

01:31:53.880 --> 01:32:02.120
out Joe's ice cream shop. And so it is pretty cool. The code to get to this is, uh, zero two

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:10.200
one five four five one one one eight two three. Um, so yeah, it is pretty much, you know, it's

01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:19.320
focused on, uh, on Biden's campaign and education. Um, but it's, it's a good idea. It's the type of

01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:26.680
thing, you know, like what AOC was doing with, uh, with her, uh, uh, live streaming, you know,

01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:34.680
and by the way, if anyone is interested for the animal crossing one and the Biden HQ Island,

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:43.000
the, uh, dream address code is seven two eight six five seven one zero seven four seven eight

01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:49.960
da first, of course, because it's a dream address. No. Um, I was just saying, I just want to ask like

01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:54.040
a serious question here because obviously, obviously it's no secret that I'm team Biden

01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:58.840
on this. I mean, I was team Warren, but I, I, I, I'm more than happy to be team Biden when

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:03.240
presented with the other option. And I've made it no secret how I feel about that on this program.

01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:09.880
But the, the hard question I want to ask is, is there really a point to this? Is there going to be

01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:16.440
fun to be had here because video games are supposed to be fun or is this obvious propaganda?

01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:23.800
Because I mean, what made AOC's Twitch stream really, really work is that it was very organic

01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:30.280
and it didn't feel like even the politics that were in it did not feel forced. Her lines of

01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:35.960
don't forget to vote and talking to the British guy about healthcare, uh, in, in his world versus

01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:41.480
ours was that it felt very organic and it felt very much like a Twitch streamer, thanking someone

01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:46.840
for the donation or talking to friends on discord. And I think that's why AOC stream, whether you

01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:53.400
agree with her or not really worked is Biden's going to feel organic or is it going to feel like,

01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:59.320
okay, I just went to propaganda Ville. It's not intended to be organic, not like AOC's thing,

01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:06.040
but you know, it's intended to, it is, it is a campaign strat. I mean, fair and simple.

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:12.920
Um, in fact, with Biden's Island on animal crossing, like the house inside has, is filled

01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:17.880
with like desk and campaign pamphlets and promotional materials. It's been turned into,

01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:24.920
uh, a campaign office, but, but yeah, but the whole thing is it gets people talking,

01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:31.720
it gets interest, whether or not you want to go to that either location in whatever game or

01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:37.320
whether or not you say, Oh, well, you know, that's a stupid idea or he's just, you know, pandering,

01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:42.040
you're talking about it. Fair. And you know, and you know what the answer might be? I'm actually,

01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:46.760
actually what ultimately where this goes is because this is in the news and you know,

01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:51.560
they know to an extent it's going to be in the news. Um, there are people on Twitch that will

01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:56.120
do a Twitch stream where it's like, I'm going to go visit the Joe Biden Island or I'm going to go

01:34:56.120 --> 01:35:01.960
visit the Joe Biden, uh, Fortnite map. And now they're having an organic conversation about

01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:09.080
politics on their Twitch feed. And maybe that is this it's, it's not necessarily the map or the

01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:14.600
Island or whatever it is themselves. It's maybe the conversation that it starts. Well, and that's

01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:23.320
what I just said that. Yes, I guess it is. Yes. It's it's they're, they're talking about it. It's

01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:27.240
getting it out there and you know, and the people are going to be cool. Let me check the Biden thing

01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:32.600
because when it's, you know, it's going to get me clicks. I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm laughing

01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:36.680
because a headline just scrolled by, you know how on Twitch we have the headlines at the bottom,

01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:42.520
a headline just scrolled by that said from Kotaku bad cat. And that was the headline. I'm like,

01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:47.240
what the fuck video game is that bad cat? Did you guys see that?

01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:54.760
Um, Oh my God, that just, that actually last night, um, you know, one of the things I mentioned

01:35:54.760 --> 01:36:01.160
I had to do for Gish was, uh, resurrect my inner child via a spell. Um, and Midna wanted to be a

01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:07.080
part of it. She wanted to run off with one of the GI Joes. I still have, she wanted to run off with

01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:13.480
snake guys, just saying, I mean, I would run off with snake guys just saying, but that that's bad

01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:21.960
cat, bad cat context to, to clarify what bad cat actually was in the Kotaku article. It's a mod for

01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:27.160
resident evil that turns, I forget what the giant like zombie thing is, but turns it into, uh,

01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:34.920
was it Tom from Tom and Jerry? Oh God. Okay. The tyrant.

01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:39.640
Okay. So, so it is video game related. So it was a game related headline. Who knew?

01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:44.280
All right, let's move on. We're running so long tonight. It's going to be,

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:52.600
let's move on. Who's next? Uh, is it Loki? Yeah, it's me. Uh, so let's talk about a launch game

01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:56.440
that's getting delayed for the PlayStation five. So one of the games they were showing

01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:00.600
off was destruction all stars, which was supposed to be launched title.

01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:09.560
Also one of those launch titles that's $70. Ooh boy. That's Sony upcharge. Um, it is now

01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:15.720
coming out in February, 2021, according to the PlayStation blog, um, as an added bonus as well

01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:21.080
for PlayStation plus subscribers, it'll be available for free for two months for no additional

01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:29.960
costs. So you'll get it as far as PlayStation plus that's better than paying $70. Yes. So it's

01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:35.560
interesting. It's very much a case of bad news. It's delayed. Good news. Uh, most people that are,

01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:39.560
you know, probably investing this money on PlayStation early are also PlayStation plus,

01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:45.880
so you're gonna get it for free. So yeah. Yeah. It's, I guess the news could have been a lot worse,

01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:51.560
right? That's true. That's the interesting thing. Halo got delayed, but it's going to be on Xbox

01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:57.080
game pass. And again, chances are, you know what, if you are adopting Xbox series X right away,

01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:01.960
you probably have game pass, not everybody, but most people probably do. All right. Well,

01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:08.760
speaking of releases and, uh, games that got bumped back, uh, you'll notice what was absent

01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:15.400
from my gaming week already. World of Warcraft shadow lands. So that was a fun week and now

01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:21.800
we're back. But, um, and I did play a lot of Final Fantasy 11. Oops, but no, I, I, I'm, you know,

01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:27.240
what 14 Final Fantasy 14. Oh shit. I said 11. Didn't I? Sorry. Yes. 14. You're not playing

01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:32.920
11 without me. What? Sorry. Sorry. My 2006 brain kicked in the mobile version finally came out.

01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:38.440
No, no, no. Yes. If I was 14. Sorry. Um, but anyway, yeah, I don't know. I I'd be curious

01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:43.080
about the expansion. I just don't know if I'm $50 curious, but I know there's a lot of people that

01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:47.560
love their Warcraft and love their characters. And I am happy to report for all of you that shadow

01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:52.440
lands is finally going to be coming out on November 23rd. Hey, that's a special day for

01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:57.880
Warcraft because it is the 16th anniversary of the game. Um, not that 16 is often a number that

01:38:57.880 --> 01:39:02.040
gets celebrated unless you're an MTV show where, um, kids scream when they don't get the car they

01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:07.560
want. Uh, but for this sweet 16, uh, world of Warcraft shadow lands will finally be released.

01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:12.840
And, uh, there, it even comes out, it comes out at 3 PM Pacific time on that day because they have

01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:16.040
to do it that way because people all around the world are playing this game. And, you know,

01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:19.880
it's going to be a world rush to who can take that boss down first. So it goes live at the

01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:25.240
same time for everybody. Uh, so that ended up being a four week delay, which all things

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:31.560
considered was not a terrible delay for the game. Um, but there's also going to be a warmup event,

01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:37.320
whatever that means on November 10th, where you will be able to take on a flood of scourge.

01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:41.560
I seem to remember when the last expansion was about to come out, there was an event like this,

01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:46.440
and it was a really easy way to gain levels fast. So I wonder if this will be a thing that's

01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:51.160
similar. I don't know, but November 10th is when the flood of the scourge happens. And also there

01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:57.720
will be season one of shadow lands on December 8th, I guess that's PVP and the first raid castle

01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:04.280
nathria will also open on December 8th. So you can take your time getting to the new level cap of

01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:08.600
60, excuse me, uh, before you take on the raids. I actually liked that they don't release that

01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:14.920
stuff right away to be honest. So, all right. Um, pod culture points out, uh, November 23rd is also

01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:19.640
Dr. Who day. And you know, I imagine there's a lot of stuff kind of happening that day because it's,

01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:25.560
it's the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, right? Thanksgiving is the 26th, right? Or 27th,

01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:30.040
something like that. So it's, it's just days before, um, Thanksgiving. And that's like,

01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:36.280
you know, right before the retail season kicks off. Although I'm sure Black Friday, as we know

01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:40.680
it here in the States is going to look a lot different this year. You're already seeing stores

01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:45.560
like Best Buy and stuff are kind of like, we're going to start early and kind of push you more

01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:50.280
towards online for obvious reasons with everything going on in the world. I'm sure there will still

01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:55.720
be, I'm sure there will still be plenty of people that are going to the store on Black Friday, but,

01:40:55.720 --> 01:41:01.800
um, not me, that's for sure. So, and I think, I think stores are kind of realizing they got to

01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:05.720
think outside the box a little bit that not everybody's going to want to rush the store,

01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:12.760
um, early that day. So, all right. Yeah. And DJRama S is, uh, uh, uh, kind of concurring there,

01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:18.280
uh, Black Friday deals done started. I'm good with this. Yeah, for sure. All right. Well,

01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:23.560
let's take a trip down memory lane when if a game was delayed by four weeks, we didn't know about

01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:28.520
it. Um, because we got our gaming news through magazines, there was no internet. It's the classic

01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:33.320
game of the week. Every week, dark soccer steps into the gaming vault to define a game that she

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:38.840
thinks, Hey, you know what, brats, you should be checking out this game. Forget your newfangled

01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:45.320
Xbox series Xs and your PlayStation fives. I want you to go back to the PlayStation one. No way. I

01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:51.400
want you to go back sooner than that and check out this classic game of the week. Dark soccer.

01:41:51.400 --> 01:42:02.520
What'd you pick for the kids tonight? I picked, uh, an RPG that is as iconic as anything else

01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:10.520
that this company has released. I picked Romancing Saga, which came out in 1992. It is a RPG, uh,

01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:16.280
developed and published by Square. It came out for the Super Famicom. Um, now it's actually the,

01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:26.280
uh, fourth game in the saga series. Um, and this particular one, um, actually had like a

01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:33.080
bunch of different, um, various releases on it. And it was a fairly, as far as some will say is

01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:42.680
kind of a big one. Um, this, uh, this one was actually, we made, um, for, uh, the Wonder

01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:49.160
Swan color. Um, it was done for mobile phones. Um, and I'll be getting into that, uh, in a

01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:59.640
little bit, but this is, uh, this is a game that while, um, not many people will think of in the,

01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:08.440
in the saga series. Um, it was one of the first ones that, um, so that's fine. Um, anyway, um,

01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:15.160
you, uh, you basically follow eight different protagonists on different quests throughout the

01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:22.120
world, and they all accumulate in a fight against the dark god, uh, Saruin. I guess that's how it's

01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:27.240
pronounced. That's always how I did it. Um, and it's very nonlinear. Um, you do have term-based

01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:35.480
battles, um, group formations, and like the other saga titles, there are no experience points. Um,

01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:41.320
your character attributes and skills are determined by what you do in battle. Um,

01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:51.160
so it was, um, you know, so the other saga games, um, this was supposed to be the, uh,

01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:56.680
the new one for the Super Famicom. There have been others on Game Boy. Um, they brought back,

01:43:56.680 --> 01:44:03.080
um, the series creator, um, Kazu Akitoshi as the director, the designer and writing the scenarios.

01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:10.360
Um, and then, uh, the character designs were done by Kobayashi Tomomi, which actually is her first

01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:15.880
work that she did for the series. Um, music done by Ito Kenji, who also did like Final Fantasy

01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:22.360
Legend 2. Um, so it had a really, really good, uh, design group behind it right away.

01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:30.200
So when you start off the game, um, you're going to choose your first protagonist and you're going

01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:37.320
to, um, explore the world. You know, it's free, free, free reign over everything. You know,

01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:43.160
you trigger different story points as you go through it. You have battles, side quests,

01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:49.480
and then you're going to build up your party as you go along. Um, some members, um, that you can

01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:56.920
recruit are the protagonist you didn't choose. Um, and so, uh, your progress is based on the number

01:44:56.920 --> 01:45:02.760
of the main events, um, your strength, who you've talked to, um, and it's been called the free

01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:08.600
scenario system. Um, you encounter enemy sprites on the field, you fight with them, you have a

01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:15.400
three by three grill, uh, grid, um, that affects how you're going to be able to interact with the

01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:24.120
enemy. Um, so, uh, there, there was a big remake done for now. This is the big one on here, um,

01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:30.040
is it was remade for PlayStation two, which was subtitled, uh, minstrel song. It was released,

01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:40.360
uh, by, uh, Squenix in 2005. Um, with, uh, this one, it does have, uh, the non-linear exploration,

01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:46.840
but the environments are all in 3d. Um, and it brought in some elements from the later saga

01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:53.080
titles. Um, and, uh, when you choose your, uh, you know, your protagonist, you go through the

01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:59.240
game the same way. You have a quick save, uh, you have a hard saves in, you know, your towns

01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:04.760
where things like that are, um, and you customize your party, you have your character classes,

01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:13.080
um, and a character can lose their life points. Um, so like your character health is a combination

01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:17.480
of your standard health and your life points and you lose life points being knocked out enough

01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:22.760
times in a battle. And then you lose all of your life points. The game is over. So that's

01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:30.280
kind of an interesting take on it. Um, but yeah, it did, uh, it did, uh, start its development in

01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:36.520
1990. Um, and they really wanted to go to the super Famicom because the other saga games on

01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:44.200
Game Boy had been so popular. Um, and so, um, and actually we did get final fantasy legend three,

01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:51.000
it was a saga three. Um, but they really wanted it to be a particular saga game.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:57.800
The name Romancing, uh, actually, uh, was, uh, inspired by an American movie Romancing Stone.

01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:05.640
Remember that movie? Like Kathleen Turner, right? Yeah. Um, and the producer of the game was, uh,

01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:13.480
Miyamoto Masumi, who was the founder and former president of Square. So, um, so yeah, the, the

01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:21.160
game had, uh, a pretty big release when it came out January 28th, 1992. Um, and it was the second

01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:26.200
super Famicom title that Square did. It followed final fantasy four, which we got, of course, this

01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:32.760
too. Um, it dated three guidebooks for it. Um, it got a virtual console re-release on the Wii in

01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:42.600
2009, Wii U in 2015 and 3DS in 2016. Um, it was supposed to have been, uh, uh, localized,

01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:49.320
um, to be brought out in the US. Um, it was, uh, stated by Gameport in 1993, but it never got

01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:55.880
released outside of Japan. Um, the text translation and complexity of the game they figured would be

01:47:55.880 --> 01:48:02.280
off-putting and not cost-effective given what they projected this to be. Um, at any rate, um,

01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:08.440
in 2000, uh, they did a version, an enhanced version of Romancing Saga for the Wonder Swan

01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:15.800
color. Um, and we know that Square really loved the Wonder Swan color doing this out. Um, but,

01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:25.240
uh, it was, it was, uh, not on Game Boy Advanced and that's because Square and Nintendo, that was

01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:30.840
when they were having their thing when Square went to PlayStation, remember? Um, yeah, so all that,

01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:35.720
but they added, um, a few new abilities that you could dash and avoid enemy encounters,

01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:43.160
um, different materials, a couple of stories, uh, changes, different side quests. Um, and it was part

01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:49.640
of the Square Masterpiece series of classic titles for Wonder Swan. Um, it was ported to mobile

01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:55.560
platforms by Square Enix. Um, it was based off Wonder Swan port. Um, they just did the graphics

01:48:55.560 --> 01:49:02.520
for mobile. Um, it came out for, in 2009, for iMode phones, um, and then for the SoftBank phones

01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:11.080
and EasyWeb, and it closed, uh, down in 2018. So then there's the PS2 remake, which was Romancing

01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:18.760
Saga menstrual song. Um, and it was like rebuilt from the ground up, like I said. Um, and the,

01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:27.400
the art style references the sprite design, but tried to go a little bit more like some of the

01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:33.560
Final Fantasy series. And it has a completely different taste. It was meant to appeal strictly

01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:41.160
to, um, not really appeal to any particular market, just be something that's, that's

01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:48.760
attractive overall. Um, and, uh, the game was re-released through PlayStation Network for

01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:54.600
PlayStation 3 eventually. Um, and then a special edition that had a download code and jigsaw

01:49:54.600 --> 01:50:01.000
artwork done by Kobayashi, um, the designer. Um, there was supposed to be, uh, they actually

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:07.560
announced a North American re, uh, release at E3 in 2005, um, along with, uh, Dragon Quest 8,

01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:15.240
Final Fantasy 7, and Kingdom Hearts 2. Um, it released on October 11th. They removed a

01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:21.960
menstrual song from the title. Um, they did, uh, some dubbing, um, done by New Generation Pictures,

01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:26.280
um, who had worked with Squenix on some of the Final Fantasy and Valkyrie profile series.

01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:35.960
And then there was a European released after that. Um, so, uh, this, uh, the original title

01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:41.400
wasn't remastered because we drew, I guess they dropped the menstrual song for us.

01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:45.640
It had really good music. I mean, I don't know how much of the video I let you listen to,

01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:51.880
but the music in this game is really top notch. It's just that got that square brilliance to it

01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:59.560
as, as the RPGs on the SNES that most of the RPGs we did on the SNES, um, display. Um, so for the

01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:06.680
Super Famicom version, it is ranked as the fifth best-selling saga game of all time. Um, it is sold

01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:13.160
more than 1.3 million copies worldwide with 1.1 million, of course, sold in Japan and those others

01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:22.520
overseas. Uh, Hamitsu, um, didn't like the graphics as much as Final Fantasy 4, but they liked the

01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:31.560
system. And so, uh, Hamitsu score was, uh, 31 of 40 for Super Famicom, 32 of 40 for, uh, PS2, which

01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:37.240
by Famitsu, not bad, not bad at all. And I can actually see that criticism. I mean, I, I never

01:51:37.240 --> 01:51:41.880
played this game because obviously it wasn't, you know, released here until, uh, you got the

01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:46.600
translation hacks and the other versions you were talking about. Um, but I can see that criticism is

01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:51.880
that, you know, especially these battle scenes look very plain, I guess. And even the world maps,

01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:56.760
they look very plain compared to Final Fantasy 2, which is what we would know it as in America,

01:51:56.760 --> 01:52:02.040
but you all know it's actually for, um, as, but I can see that the battle system does, it does seem

01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:07.160
like there's, there's more to it. So I actually, it's interesting, just not even knowing that much

01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:12.360
about the game, but based on like what you just said, I can like kind of see that. Yeah. And one

01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:17.640
of the, one of the things with it though, is that, uh, American critics kind of panned the, um, the

01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:25.000
battle system in it because they thought it was too complex. But I mean, I liked it. You know,

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:29.720
when I played a little bit of it, you know, back on my, you know, fan translated emulation days,

01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:37.560
um, it, it's, it's a solid game with a solid story. Um, uh, but moving, moving forward,

01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:43.880
of course, um, it proved to be so popular and influential that, um, you know, and of course

01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:48.840
it brought in new mechanics and a new type of, of gameplay that after it was so successful,

01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:54.440
they did two further titles for Super Famicom. They had Romancing Saga 2 and Romancing Saga 3.

01:52:54.440 --> 01:53:04.760
Um, uh, 2 came out in 93 and 3 came out in 95. And so that's the game. Um, I, I like what ACT

01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:12.040
DEV said, then we got Mystic Quest. Um, Mystic Quest wasn't bad. It was like RPG for very small

01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:16.840
children. And it had a great score. We'll give, we'll give Mystic Quest that it had good music.

01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:25.160
Yeah. And, you know, I honestly, I think that the, you know, and you know, how much like the

01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:32.200
saga games, uh, like that came out on PlayStation go for. Oh yeah. You know, um, Saga Frontier,

01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:38.840
um, you know, all of those, they. Which is funny cause I rented Saga Frontier once and I hated it.

01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:46.760
Yeah. You know, I have, um, crap was that I had another saga game that I have in Japanese,

01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:55.080
honestly. And it ended up being like way too like advanced, uh, text heavy that I couldn't,

01:53:55.880 --> 01:54:01.080
couldn't really do. Um, but yeah. Um, but I mean, it's just,

01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:09.640
it's a shame that we never got the Super Famicom. We could have had it. Um, and I think that,

01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:17.560
you know, this particular game is just, you know, it, it really did something, you know, like,

01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:22.840
like I say, it was a square second game on the system and I think it really set off a boom in

01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:30.520
JRPGs on the Super Famicom. So, um, but of course, you know, for the other games in the title,

01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:36.360
of course, the saga games, um, came out in the US as Final Fantasy Legend, Final Fantasy Legend 2,

01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:40.760
and Final Fantasy Legend 3. Then there was Romancing Saga, Romancing Saga 2, Romancing

01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:48.040
Saga 3. Um, then there was Saga Frontier, Saga Frontier 2, and, uh, we got, uh, Unlimited Saga,

01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:53.880
Emperor Saga, Imperial Saga, and Saga Scarlet Grace. And there was the Legend of Legacy and the

01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:58.520
Alliance Alive. So those are the things that came out with the Saga series.

01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:05.640
Really has its own amount of following, maybe not as much as the Final Fantasy ones, but it was

01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:11.320
pretty good. All right. And now they're talking about Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. Yeah. I see

01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:16.200
that in chat talking about that. All right. Well, there it is your classic game of the week,

01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:23.080
Romancing Saga for the Super Famicom. I have to say that instead of Super Nintendo because, uh,

01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:27.240
well, we never really got it. Oops, got the wrong shot there. We never really got it on the, uh,

01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:33.800
Super Nintendo. So, all right. Well, that is going to do it for Dark Sakura tonight because

01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:38.680
I know we only wrote you in for half show because you are, you are sick. So, um, please feel better.

01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:43.640
I mean, I haven't, you heard my voice cutting out. Yeah. We can hear it starting to go. So rest up,

01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:49.240
feel better. I know all the chat, um, is, uh, sending you good vibes to heal up soon and all

01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:56.440
that good stuff. I actually see me unmade for once. Yeah. I'm in my, but I have a new webcam

01:55:56.440 --> 01:56:00.680
that honestly, I think it's got some problems. I mean, I didn't pay much for it, but better than

01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:04.040
my old one. I think it's better than your old one. Yeah. It's a different angle tonight. It's good.

01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:08.440
So I'm looking for, I, but I will say when you are feeling better, I am looking forward to the

01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:13.720
return of the wigs. Not that your natural hair isn't beautiful, but we do. This ain't natural.

01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:18.760
There's nothing natural about this color. We do love a good wig. All right. We love a wig.

01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:22.760
Before I let you go to our soccer, any final thoughts or last words for our listeners tonight?

01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:28.840
I'm coming to your house right now for a stroke. Oh, um, I do have my thoughts. I,

01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:32.840
I know that there's not going to be much time by the time the podcast gets released,

01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:41.320
but go out and vote, do it and, um, be safe when you do it. Wear your mask. We are coming into

01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:50.280
the third wave of coronavirus. Um, and gen X, geeks.com, G E X. Oh, one last thing. Yeah. I

01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:59.000
was on the last episode of, am I mental? Oh yes. Yes. We had Eon. Their show can be about one hour.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:05.240
They have a hard cut at three. We hit the hard cut without noticing. Wow. All right. Two hours.

01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:11.800
Sorry. So yeah. Um, I brought a little OLR randomness. It happens. All right. Yeah.

01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:16.280
Go check it out. You get to hear me talk about how fucked up my brain is. I got to check that

01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:20.360
out. Just be not, you know, like, but I'm just, I bet it was a good show. I bet it was a good

01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:24.760
discussion. A lot of it, Rob. Yeah. I mean, I'm not tuning in to hear that. I just, you know,

01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:30.040
I'm curious to hear, you know, the discussion we talked about supernatural hot too. Well,

01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:33.240
I can get that without just talking to you on text message. All right.

01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:38.040
All right. Well, Hey, my, my, my love to you guys, my love to the listeners,

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:43.560
pet all the cats and harass all the children. All right. Will do. Have a good night.

01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:50.120
Look, you tell Nellie I owe her cookies. Bye. All right. Bye. Take care. All right. We'll do.

01:57:50.120 --> 01:57:56.760
All right. We'll fix up the camera shot there and we will move on to talking about some rapid

01:57:56.760 --> 01:58:02.920
fire news and traveling around the industry with some quick headlines. Loki. Yes. So we've found

01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:07.960
out what the new games for this month are going to be for free that your games with gold, if you

01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:17.080
will, on the Xbox side of things, we have a looks like Aragami shadow edition and swim sanity.

01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:25.720
Those are both Xbox one and then Xbox compatible games we have looks like full spectrum warrior,

01:58:25.720 --> 01:58:31.800
which is actually an original Xbox game and Indiana Jones or Lego, Indiana Jones

01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:40.200
or the Xbox three 60. So, uh, interesting. And then great titles with the new console coming

01:58:40.200 --> 01:58:45.480
out. Sorry, but they're not, but I, you know, it's so hard now because of game. Exactly.

01:58:45.480 --> 01:58:51.880
It's so hard because of game pass. Like. Exactly. Like I'm not disappointed because I have game pass.

01:58:52.840 --> 01:58:57.240
But yeah, no, I mean, you, you do have to look at what's going on with Sony, which, you know,

01:58:57.240 --> 01:59:02.680
you'll get to and it's, it's a different story. So Sony's got some more exciting stuff. So for

01:59:02.680 --> 01:59:09.160
example, they have hollow Knight Boyd heart edition and middle earth shadow of war. That's on

01:59:09.880 --> 01:59:16.360
on PlayStation four. Um, also if you're a PlayStation five owner, you get bug snacks.

01:59:17.160 --> 01:59:21.080
That's huge. Those are. Yeah. And that's going to be available for two months as well,

01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:25.160
much like the other game on PlayStation five that they were offering for two months,

01:59:25.160 --> 01:59:31.080
uh, next year. So this is from November 12th through January 4th. You can pick up bug snacks.

01:59:31.080 --> 01:59:36.440
I'm wondering since I don't own a PlayStation five, if it's one of those things where I can

01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:42.280
kind of add it to my library type of thing. So I used to do that with Xbox one games back when I

01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:47.880
still had a third Xbox or Sony's going to be complete dicks about it and just say, no, sorry,

01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:53.640
you didn't register PlayStation five of those. Uh, okay. I've got to be lucky to be fair. That's

01:59:53.640 --> 01:59:57.960
not them being dicks. That's just business, you know, by a PlayStation five. It's a little,

01:59:57.960 --> 02:00:02.760
it's a little bit being a dick, but no, no, no, no. It is though, because I'm paying for their

02:00:02.760 --> 02:00:07.160
PlayStation plus service. So I should be entitled to the games that they're offering for free.

02:00:07.160 --> 02:00:11.080
It shouldn't be a caveat that, Oh, well, I'm sorry. You got to also purchase a PlayStation

02:00:11.080 --> 02:00:14.920
five right now. Cause that wasn't the way it used to be with other systems. All right. I'll give you

02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:18.760
that. But we don't know to me, but we don't know if we'll be able to redeem it or not yet. Yeah.

02:00:18.760 --> 02:00:23.400
Anyways. But they are very explicit that it is only the PlayStation five version of bug snacks

02:00:23.400 --> 02:00:27.720
that we do know. You can't hit that and then get it on your PlayStation four that you can't do.

02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:33.480
We know that. Yeah. So you, you will get it a PlayStation five copy in your library if you will.

02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:39.800
Um, so yeah, I'll go ahead and try to do that. But I like, I finally was able to redeem the

02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:45.240
October ones. I could not get their online site to work correctly. It would not detect that I have

02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:50.440
PlayStation plus, even though I very much do have PlayStation plus I have a boot up my PlayStation

02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:54.920
four to actually go download them. There's a very easy new method to try that I will talk about

02:00:54.920 --> 02:01:00.520
later wink. Yeah. Look at the show roll what's coming up and that's how I did it. And it's,

02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:07.160
it's easy. All right. And then on top of that, um, we talked about last week, how call of duty was

02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:15.640
reducing the file size of modern warfare, um, to allow it to be, you know, more digestible,

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:24.040
but, uh, the new call of duty black, um, cold war, uh, black ops, cold war, it's going to be

02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:33.640
250 gigabytes on PC, which is enormous. Oh my God. So apparently though they have a non 4k

02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:40.440
install, which brings it down to one 75 gigabytes or a multiplayer only client, which is only 50

02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:48.360
gigabytes, but Jesus says ridiculous. Wow. Hopefully the console version isn't, isn't as big

02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:53.640
because I mean, the day one batch, that's the whole game. We'll look at like play, look at a

02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:57.640
PlayStation five. I think the usable hard drive space on that. It's like only 700 megabytes. So

02:01:57.640 --> 02:02:03.000
you're talking about third of the hard drive used up for one game. That's so stupid. Um,

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:07.160
Bobby black Wolf and chat says, remember data caps in many areas are only 1.2 terabytes.

02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:10.920
So that's almost one fifth of a monthly data cap. And yeah, I'm, I'm getting to the point where

02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:17.240
those data caps are really getting to be a concern. We hit like 980 gigs, like within the

02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:24.120
past month, but it's because, um, without getting into it, like basically like somebody would leave

02:02:24.120 --> 02:02:30.520
Twitch streams running and not be there watching them for a couple of hours. Um, and you know,

02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:36.840
I was like, we got, but you know, I understand like, I'm sympathetic to this because how often

02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:42.280
have we had the TV on in the background and just had it running and it's background noise. Shit.

02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:47.560
My TV came with an ambient mode that that is its purpose is to just be on in the background kind

02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:52.680
of running. So that's kind of like what we've kind of instilled with our motions, but now it's like,

02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:58.600
Oh crap, I can't do that with a constantly downloading stream or something because

02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:03.400
I might hit a bandwidth cap. Like, and that's, it's crazy that that's the thing we have to

02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:08.840
worry about right now. I really hope these companies kind of evaluate that stuff. So yes,

02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:13.320
Bobby Blackwell says Smush needs to close his Twitch streams. Yes, he does. Yes, he does.

02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:20.040
So, all right. And no one special Twitch streams. Did I, I don't think, I don't think I said the

02:03:20.040 --> 02:03:26.440
other thing you're hinting at there. All right. Anyway, let's move on. Um, so, uh, let's talk

02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:30.760
about N7 Day cause that's going to be this week. And of course, if you're a fan of Mass Effect,

02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:37.320
then you know that November 7th or N7 is kind of a big deal. Um, and you know, N7 Day never went

02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:41.880
away. It's always kind of an annual celebration of Mass Effect, although I feel like they do some

02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:48.040
bigger things one years than others, but, uh, what's happening, uh, Marc Meer actually said,

02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:53.640
uh, over the weekend that he's going to be doing a, or joining an N7 Day stream that's taking place

02:03:53.640 --> 02:04:00.120
on November 7th at 11 AM Pacific. And it's not just going to be him. Jennifer Hale will be there

02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:05.640
too. So if you're male Shep or female Shep, guess what? They will both be there. And the voice actors

02:04:05.640 --> 02:04:13.960
for Caden, Liara, Jack, Grunt, Ashley, Samantha trainer, Morden and Legion are all going to be

02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:20.360
there. Now, something interesting I noticed about that list. It's all characters from the original

02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:26.440
trilogy and none from Andromeda. Now, I said I wasn't going to talk about that game until

02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:33.720
they officially announce it, but if I were going to finally, finally fucking announce that game,

02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:37.800
this might be the group of people I want to get together on a Zoom call to do it.

02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:42.680
Probably. Didn't we have it rumored that it was supposed to be still coming out like, uh,

02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:49.320
like trademarks or something or, uh, ESRV ratings? You know what, Loki? I'm not going to talk about

02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:57.640
it. You know, sorry. You know how I feel. It'll happen when it happens. But I,

02:04:59.480 --> 02:05:03.960
let me just put it this way. If they don't say anything at this November 7th thing,

02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:10.280
then like, I am so done. I am so, I can't even. Wouldn't it make more sense for those remakes to

02:05:10.280 --> 02:05:14.840
come out on the brand new systems that they're releasing just now versus like the current

02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:19.080
systems? Wouldn't you think that that might be why they're waiting a little bit? And I'd

02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:24.600
be okay with that. And that Loki, that's a very logical answer. Um, and I am all about that

02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:32.600
answer if that is the case. Yes. We'll see. All right. Anyhow. Uh, other, one other story here.

02:05:32.600 --> 02:05:38.440
Oh yes. Wizardry. I don't know if y'all know about the wizardry series, but this, this goes way back

02:05:38.440 --> 02:05:43.720
in gaming's history, right? The classic classic games wizardry. Um, well, a Japanese company

02:05:43.720 --> 02:05:50.520
named DRECOM has just picked up the copyright domestic foreign trademark rights to wizardry.

02:05:50.520 --> 02:05:55.720
And that means they now have the copyrights to wizardry six, seven and eight and wizardry gold.

02:05:55.720 --> 02:06:01.320
And they basically have the trademark over that name. This company is saying they will, uh, keep

02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:05.320
their commitment to the acquisition of popular intellectual properties and the development and

02:06:05.320 --> 02:06:12.200
cultivation of the internal properties. Here's the downside. DRECOM is a mobile game developer

02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:17.400
and they're based out of Tokyo. Uh, now they've worked on cool stuff like Disgaea, RPG,

02:06:17.400 --> 02:06:23.640
everybody's golf, the mobile version. So, you know, there's the, it's not all bad news. Um,

02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:29.080
but that's where the wizardry stuff is right now. So maybe, maybe Loki, they'll make something that

02:06:29.080 --> 02:06:37.880
will be for Facebook gaming cloud service. Oh, check out that wizardry I'm showing. All right.

02:06:38.520 --> 02:06:43.000
That's it for rapid fire news. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates. I

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:46.680
know we're getting into that time of year where there's going to be a lot, right? Loki.

02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:52.520
Um, not so much this week because they're saving it all for next week. Um, this week we've got,

02:06:52.520 --> 02:06:59.240
uh, Bakugan champions of Astoria that's on Nintendo switch, uh, Jurassic world evolution

02:06:59.240 --> 02:07:06.040

descenders on Nintendo switch dirt five on PC PlayStation four and X-Box one need for speed,

hot pursuit remastered on PC PlayStation four and X-Box one. And last but not least

02:07:24.680 --> 02:07:29.480
tropical six on Nintendo switch. That's it. All right. Well, Japan has, uh, quite a few

02:07:29.480 --> 02:07:33.640
releases this week compared to other weeks on the Nintendo switch this week. Uh, we have

02:07:33.640 --> 02:07:39.960
alpaca ball all stars is out this week. And I'm wondering if, I'm wondering if that is actually

02:07:39.960 --> 02:07:48.920
some type of game that stars alpacas that you actually like. Oh my God, it is fabulous. I am

02:07:48.920 --> 02:07:54.520
all about that. Uh, and it looks like that game's coming out in Europe as well at some point. So

02:07:54.520 --> 02:07:58.600
I'm sure we'll get it here. We'll see. Um, other games coming out in Japan, construction simulator

02:07:58.600 --> 02:08:03.960
two and three on the switch. Uh, we also have real time battle Shogi online, um,

02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:11.320
Ochi de Rilakkuma, uh, Rilakkuma ga Ochi ni Yatakita comes out this week. Uh, we also have

02:08:11.320 --> 02:08:16.520
shadow verse champions battle and a game called Mary Skelter finale. And I was like,

02:08:16.520 --> 02:08:21.080
what the hell is this game? Check out this description. You ready? Mary Skelter finale

02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:26.280
is the latest series that depicts the end of jailbreak drama that revealed through Mary

02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:30.120
Skelter nightmares, Mary Skelter two and the Mary Skelter short stories.

02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:35.000
The protagonist who is trapped in jail with a living prison full of strings,

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:41.960
monsters called Martians aims to escape with the help of blood maidens who possess a special power

02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:46.520
and judging from the special art book, the blood maidens are sexy maidens.

02:08:47.480 --> 02:08:53.800
So, I mean, aren't they all, I would hope so. All right. Happy Halloween. A little late. Anyway,

02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:59.400
on the PlayStation four that Mary Skelter finale games also out there, as well as ACE combat seven,

02:08:59.400 --> 02:09:03.480
getting a price reduction and, uh, that's it. So it's a little more exciting on the switch this

02:09:03.480 --> 02:09:09.560
week. Um, how about the UK Loki since, uh, dark soccer took off. So yeah, in the UK, we've got,

02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:14.760
uh, the walking dead saints and sinners, the complete collection on PlayStation four,

02:09:14.760 --> 02:09:25.160
Troy, a total war saga on PC ancestors legacy on switch instant chef party on Nintendo switch

02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:33.080
need for speed hot pursuit. Uh, I believe that's the remake that's on PlayStation four and Xbox one.

02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:41.320
Uh, let's see. And they're also selling a combination Pokemon sword plus expansion pack,

02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:45.640
both a sword and shield that they're doing that. And those are both on the switch. Of course,

02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:55.000
uh, black desert procedure edition on PlayStation four and Xbox one LOL surprise remix. We rule the

02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:03.000
world on Nintendo switch Stardew valley on Nintendo switch and see Tropico six.

02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:11.960
Also Nintendo switch PAW patrol, mighty pups on a PlayStation four, Xbox one and Nintendo switch

02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:18.200
cloud punk on PlayStation four, Xbox one and Nintendo switch. And they have a little bit

02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:25.480
more games over there. Um, Bakugan champion champion of petroleum on to the switch dirt

02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:33.480
five on PlayStation four and Xbox one descenders on Nintendo switch. And thankfully that's it.

02:10:33.480 --> 02:10:39.160
All right. Big list. Uh, so, uh, some comments cause you know, alpaca ball got some reaction

02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:45.240
in chat. And so, uh, we have SSJ, I'm sorry. Act Def says, um, president cat and vice president

02:10:45.240 --> 02:10:50.280
alpaca, um, better than the current administration and just saying, uh, how, sorry, I'm not supposed

02:10:50.280 --> 02:10:55.160
to talk about politics. Damn it. Uh, but active. I love the fact checking that happens on the show

02:10:55.160 --> 02:11:01.880
where our chat goes the extra mile at depth in chat says, uh, or gave a link alpaca ball

02:11:01.880 --> 02:11:08.440
all stars is on steam right now. So you don't have to be in Japan to play alpaca ball unless

02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:12.760
you want to play it on switch, I guess, uh, in Japan. Uh, but you can get it on steam right now.

02:11:12.760 --> 02:11:17.080
And, uh, active to say it is, it is what you think it's alpacas playing soccer best game ever.

02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:23.160
I mean, what, what more do you need? I like, I like a game. That's honest. You know,

02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:29.720
I don't like a game where the title doesn't make sense and it's vague. And what does it mean?

02:11:30.280 --> 02:11:35.480
I'd like a game that just puts it all on the table. You know, this is what it is.

02:11:35.480 --> 02:11:43.080
Take it or leave it. All right. This is an alpaca and it's playing soccer. Exactly.

02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:49.400
Uh, vidpower 573 in chat says alpaca ball goes great with goat of duty.

02:11:50.040 --> 02:11:56.920
What about goat simulator? All right. Go to duty is a little different. It's more of just,

02:11:56.920 --> 02:12:02.280
it was kind of, uh, joking off of goat simulator and then, um, call it duty. So

02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:09.080
I don't know. It was free for a while ago. That's just J 100. Matt says if 2020 continues to go

02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:16.680
south, at least we have this. That's right. 2020 the year of COVID pandemic and well,

02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:23.880
Hey, at least there was a packable moving on. You guys are killing me. Moving on. Let's get

02:12:23.880 --> 02:12:30.360
to the next story. Uh, Oh, everyone's talking about this, right? Logan. Yeah. So, uh, fortunately

02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:37.880
we, we got the news and even though games have gone gold, like cyberpunk 2077, apparently going

02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:42.680
gold does not mean that it's still not going to be delayed again. And that's what happened. So,

02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:50.440
they had put out a message on Twitter saying that, you know, we were sorry, but unfortunately we need

02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:55.640
additional time to work on that. That ominous black text on a yellow background. That's starting

02:12:55.640 --> 02:13:01.160
to look like the fucking BBC breaking news alert logo. Like when you, when you see it pop up on

02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:09.880
your Twitter feed, you're like, Oh, what now? Right. It's currently been delayed to December

02:13:09.880 --> 02:13:16.760
7th or I'm sorry, December 10th. I say currently, because I have a feeling that's going to be

02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:28.520
delayed again. And if you want to believe anonymous posts on Twitter, then according to an anonymous

02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:35.240
insider that works at CG product, read about four to five months worth of time to work on the game.

02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:42.440
So whatever at this point, like I, I don't, so they're working on the day one patch stuff

02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:49.560
right now. Obviously I don't see how it gets delayed that much because the game went gold,

02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:56.920
right? And they're already pressing the disks, right? So three weeks to make a patch that fixes

02:13:56.920 --> 02:14:01.720
some pretty major issues, I guess makes sense, even though technically there's going to be

02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:05.160
people who can't download that patch right away. So that disc needs to be able to like,

02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:10.760
kind of play the game, but delaying it all the way to March for a day one patch, that just seems

02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:15.960
a little, I don't know. But again, you, you, you said the source, so take it or leave it is a

02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:22.680
forum post. So, you know, take it or leave it. That would just be very surprising. That's all

02:14:22.680 --> 02:14:27.400
I'm going to say. And look, I've heard all that. I get it. I get it. And I usually game delays are

02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:32.280
fine because I get it. A good game is a bad game is a bad game forever. Blah, blah, blah. Said

02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:37.320
Miyamoto. Nobody will remember the delay, which or three was delayed a ton of times. Who cares

02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:41.320
at this point? Yes, yes, yes. I get it. And I support all of that. And yes, if the game

02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:47.480
isn't ready, then fucking delay it. I get it. However, the sheer number of times it's had to

02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:53.080
be delayed. And then on top of that, a three week delay, like a little baby step delay.

02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:57.320
There's something about those little, like, you know, bumblebee looking announcements on

02:14:57.320 --> 02:15:02.040
the cyberpunk Twitter that are just starting to become self parody in a way. You know what I mean?

02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:07.000
It's like, and they are, in fact, a bunch of people were parodying to make all sorts of

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:11.640
announcements. Where is your project management? Like, how have you guys missed the day so many

02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:19.640
times? Well, I'm okay. You know what? Pandemic. Everybody's working from home. Not everybody was

02:15:19.640 --> 02:15:26.200
prepared for that. I do get it. But you know, you just can't help. But that was the September to

02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:31.800
November delay. So what about the rest of the time? You can't help, but just feels a little

02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:38.520
bit of like, Oh my God, what is what is going on over there? But hey, look, if the game comes out,

02:15:38.520 --> 02:15:42.360
and it kicks all sort of asses every, you know, everybody's setting the bar pretty fucking high

02:15:42.360 --> 02:15:47.400
for this game. So I mean, that's that act. I see that as a problem in some ways. Maybe the delays

02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:51.400
are to help lower the bar. I don't know. But people are setting the bar pretty fucking high

02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:57.000
for this game. So hopefully it delivers. And you know, people, you're right, like The Witcher 3,

02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:00.920
nobody's gonna care about the delay at the end of the day. But, and I brought this up on Bobby's

02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:05.000
show before we went live tonight, one interesting thing about even a three week delay is that now

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:09.400
this game is no longer going to be eligible for the Game Awards this year. Because Game Awards

02:16:09.400 --> 02:16:13.640
eligibility, if I remember right, based on last year, runs through the last week in November. It

02:16:13.640 --> 02:16:18.520
may not be exactly November 30. But it's around that like, black, sorry, something just fell over

02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:23.720
in studio. It's around that Black Friday timeline. So by bumping into December, they're gonna miss

02:16:23.720 --> 02:16:29.240
it. So now it's not going to be eligible for Game of the Year. And it's gonna have to be one of

02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:35.320
those games that you kind of remember deep into 2021 against whatever else comes out next year.

02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:42.600
And you know, you might have some big, you know, like, Horizon Forbidden West, or maybe even the

02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:46.920
Ragnarok game are going to be out on PlayStation 5. Microsoft will finally get Halo out and

02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:50.200
whatever other big titles they have, you know, there's gonna be some pretty whopper titles next

02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:55.240
year. So Cyberpunk is gonna have to compete against all that as opposed to this year where

02:16:56.280 --> 02:17:00.920
Nintendo isn't putting out a lot this holiday. Animal Crossing is likely to be a Game of the

02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:04.760
Year nominee just because of what it, you know, kind of represents with the pandemic and everything.

02:17:04.760 --> 02:17:10.600
And Final Fantasy 7 Remake will probably get a nomination. And I'm not saying, I think Hades

02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:14.120
really stands a shot at getting a nomination. At least I hope it does. It does in my heart.

02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:20.280
But I feel like this is like an, and it's not what the quality of games this year has been bad.

02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:26.600
But I think just by nature, because it has been in a technological sense, the lame duck year before

02:17:26.600 --> 02:17:30.680
the new consoles, and then the pandemic on top of that, I mean, look at the pandemic did in the

02:17:30.680 --> 02:17:35.800
movie industry, right? Like the Oscars next year. Like, what are the Oscars gonna look like next

02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:40.920
year? They're combining like, isn't it like 15 months of movies or something? It's gonna be weird.

02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:50.920
So, it's gonna be interesting to see what that does to award season and so forth and what game

02:17:50.920 --> 02:17:58.120
actually does win the game awards. So, SSG100Matt in chat says, I'm fine with the delay. All kidding

02:17:58.120 --> 02:18:02.120
aside, I personally don't have the time to play right now. I just moved and I don't even have a

02:18:02.120 --> 02:18:09.960
console set up. Do you think, Loki, if they were to do a bigger delay into March, and that's a big

02:18:09.960 --> 02:18:14.920
if, okay? I'm gonna play the tin foil hat game just because we have the time to do that on a

02:18:14.920 --> 02:18:20.760
three-hour show. To play the tin foil hat game, if they do bump it to March, you had just mentioned

02:18:20.760 --> 02:18:25.160
about Mass Effect. Wouldn't you rather they delay it to make it even better on the new systems?

02:18:25.160 --> 02:18:32.040
Do you think bumping it to March may be because they're going to jazz it up, zhuzh it up for the

02:18:32.040 --> 02:18:35.720
new systems even more than they'd planned? They were already gonna do that, though. They were

02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:42.120
already delaying the next-gen versions until March, so they were already planning. Isn't that the problem?

02:18:42.920 --> 02:18:48.120
Didn't they say that in their last release? They have, yeah, but they have nine versions to work on

02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:53.080
excluding the two next-gen versions. They have the versions, basically, so they have the, you know,

02:18:53.080 --> 02:19:00.760
PlayStation 4, PC. They have, you know, the PlayStation 4 Pro, PlayStation 5 backwards

02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:07.400
compatibility, Xbox One, Xbox Series X backwards compatibility, Xbox Series S backwards

02:19:07.400 --> 02:19:14.440
compatibility. I'm not sure what all the other ones were, but it's a lot of stuff that they have

02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:18.680
to test to see if it's going to be working correctly, and

02:19:21.080 --> 02:19:25.560
I don't know. That's excluding the other versions, though. Oh, and I'm sorry, Stadia.

02:19:25.560 --> 02:19:33.640
How could I forget Stadia? Well, it's easy. Facebook Gaming. I don't see Facebook Gaming on there,

02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:39.880
so that's a plus. Clearly, it's not a real game. All right, let's move on. Loki, I mentioned earlier

02:19:39.880 --> 02:19:44.440
in the show about another way to get your PlayStation Plus games, and that is through

02:19:44.440 --> 02:19:51.000
the brand new PlayStation app. So, Sony actually updated the PlayStation app, which is to match

02:19:51.560 --> 02:19:58.360
the re-look of the PlayStation 5 and so forth, and so far, the new app seems to be doing better than

02:19:58.360 --> 02:20:02.040
the new store did when we were talking about that last week, where it was like, where is the title

02:20:02.040 --> 02:20:05.640
of the games? But I will say, if you check out, are you looking down right now because you're

02:20:05.640 --> 02:20:09.880
downloading the app? I'm looking at my PlayStation. I already have a PlayStation app.

02:20:11.400 --> 02:20:14.840
Look, I have to look at my phone during the show sometimes, too. That's too funny a time

02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:20.040
that I'm talking about that, and suddenly you're looking down. Well, I want to see if it looks

02:20:20.040 --> 02:20:24.440
right. And see if you can redeem your PlayStation Plus game and see if it's a little easier. Oh,

02:20:24.440 --> 02:20:30.440
wait, you already did. I already did, yeah. All right. Well, anyway, so you can go into that,

02:20:30.440 --> 02:20:35.000
and what's neat about it is that you'll be able to actually manage your PlayStation 5

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:42.120
storage through the app as well, which I believe Xbox Game Pass app allows you to do that a little

02:20:42.120 --> 02:20:48.360
bit, too. So it's nice that Sony is joining that, too, where you can kind of mobile manage it,

02:20:48.360 --> 02:20:51.800
especially when you're talking about downloading big games. And I think that's why it's important

02:20:51.800 --> 02:20:55.960
to be able to connect to your system and kind of manage some of the big, big, especially if you got

02:20:55.960 --> 02:21:03.720
like 250 gigs filled up by Go to Duty or whatever, then you got to delete some stuff to make room

02:21:03.720 --> 02:21:10.200
sometimes. So anyway, the app was updated this last week. It was updated on iOS and Android.

02:21:10.200 --> 02:21:14.120
There's now a home screen, and you have friends on there and recently played games. The app used

02:21:14.120 --> 02:21:19.880
to be split. There was a messaging app, and thank God somebody figured out that was a terrible idea,

02:21:19.880 --> 02:21:23.480
and they homogenized that into the one app. So if you have the standalone messaging app,

02:21:23.480 --> 02:21:28.280
you can get rid of it. The main app will show you your friends list, let you chat with those people.

02:21:28.360 --> 02:21:36.200
Messages is in there as well. And that's pretty cool. You can also, through the app, voice chat

02:21:36.200 --> 02:21:40.520
with friends on their PlayStation. So that's something they're kind of bridging the gap with

02:21:40.520 --> 02:21:45.080
as well. Whereas like, you know, on Nintendo, the only voice chat is through the app. And I don't

02:21:45.080 --> 02:21:51.400
think Microsoft really has that right now, where you can chat through the app with people in the

02:21:51.400 --> 02:21:56.040
game. It could be wrong. Good, because it's a terrible idea, unless you're not like playing

02:21:56.040 --> 02:22:00.840
with people and you just want to chat with some random person that has a PlayStation account,

02:22:00.840 --> 02:22:04.600
but they're not playing games. You could just like call them on the phone,

02:22:05.720 --> 02:22:13.880
or FaceTime or whatever. Use my phone for phone things? No. Or, you know, Discord's the thing,

02:22:13.880 --> 02:22:19.240
I guess. Yeah. Discord's the big one now too. That's a lot. Like, you know, I play games with

02:22:19.240 --> 02:22:24.360
people. We just hang on Discord. So there's been nights where like, I'm playing something,

02:22:24.360 --> 02:22:27.400
my friend's playing something else, and we're still just chatting on Discord. You know,

02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:34.120
whatever. So anyway. Also, the store. You know, the store is integrated into the app,

02:22:34.120 --> 02:22:37.560
because that's the real money maker. So because the app doesn't cost you anything,

02:22:37.560 --> 02:22:41.160
but if you want to buy stuff through the store, that will do it. But you can also, again,

02:22:41.160 --> 02:22:45.400
manage that remotely. So that's pretty cool. I'm glad to hear the app is getting an update.

02:22:45.400 --> 02:22:49.400
I'm very glad to hear it's not two separate apps anymore. And again, I went in there and

02:22:49.400 --> 02:22:53.880
used the app a little bit and it was good. I was able to redeem my game. So try that next month,

02:22:53.880 --> 02:22:58.600
Loki. I will try that next month since their website sucks. All right. So bad. Maybe they'll

02:22:58.600 --> 02:23:03.400
fix the website by next month, but we'll see. All right. I got another story for you guys,

02:23:03.400 --> 02:23:08.760
and it's about Netflix. I know a lot of you guys are, you know, streaming and watching all that.

02:23:08.760 --> 02:23:14.280
And we know that there's a lot of video game related projects in the works at Netflix right

02:23:14.280 --> 02:23:20.920
now. But let me take a moment to tell you just how many there are. There are 10 different projects

02:23:20.920 --> 02:23:28.440
in the works right now at Netflix. And this list doesn't even have The Witcher, apparently. The

02:23:28.440 --> 02:23:33.640
Witcher Blood Origin, I guess, is the new... I'm sorry. The Witcher Blood Origin is the prequel

02:23:33.640 --> 02:23:39.640
series. So that is on the list. But The Witcher season two is not on this list I'm about to read

02:23:39.640 --> 02:23:43.800
here. So there's two Witcher shows right now. Although yes, if you want to get technical,

02:23:43.800 --> 02:23:49.400
The Witcher is based on a book. But we all know the game helped and the game set our expectations

02:23:49.400 --> 02:23:55.320
of what the show would actually look like. What else is in the works? Resident Evil,

02:23:55.320 --> 02:24:01.400
a live action series. Resident Evil Infinite Darkness, a animated series. Assassin's Creed,

02:24:01.400 --> 02:24:08.680
a live series. Cyberpunk Edgerunners, an animated series. Splinter Cell, an animated series. The

02:24:08.680 --> 02:24:16.840
Division, a live movie. Devil May Cry, an animated series. Final Fantasy, a live series. I keep

02:24:16.840 --> 02:24:21.800
forgetting that is in development. It's actually... This list doesn't say it's Final Fantasy 14,

02:24:21.800 --> 02:24:25.880
but it is. Not something because it's the same people that did The Witcher that are working on

02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:31.720
it. And The Cuphead Show, an animated series. All of that being worked on right now. And

02:24:31.720 --> 02:24:36.760
Castlevania is getting a fourth season. Dragon's Dogma just came out within this last month,

02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:42.280
that animated series. So Netflix is like the home of video game adaptations right now. It's

02:24:42.280 --> 02:24:51.320
pretty crazy. But that's good. What do you think about all these video game projects on... This

02:24:51.320 --> 02:24:55.800
doesn't even count what's already out there, like the Ingress anime, although I doubt they're doing

02:24:55.800 --> 02:24:59.800
another season of that. Or some of the other stuff that's out there. It's just kind of neat.

02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:05.800
I probably won't get around to watching it. I still haven't watched any of The Witcher or

02:25:06.440 --> 02:25:11.240
Castlevania, even though I hear those are really good. I did, unfortunately,

02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:19.000
try watching the Ingress anime and that was not very good. I don't know. Maybe I'll check out

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:27.800
one of them. Maybe the live action Final Fantasy 14 would be interesting. We'll see. I have to run

02:25:27.800 --> 02:25:34.600
out of things to watch. Questbuster in chat says, the Dragon's Dogma one isn't bad. So there's that.

02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:40.520
SG100Matt says, hope they all don't suck. All right. I think they're pretty good so far. I

02:25:40.520 --> 02:25:45.960
don't think that there's a lot that have been really terrible. The only thing that makes

02:25:45.960 --> 02:25:51.560
Ingress the anime bad is the same thing that makes Ingress bad. And that's the storyline's

02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:55.800
too convoluted and doesn't make any sense. Who plays for the story?

02:25:56.600 --> 02:26:00.760
I will cry. I understand that. But why make an anime if the story is not compelling?

02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:08.760
I don't know. It's just not very good. But that's the fault of the source material. Not so much

02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:15.960
that the people aren't talented enough to make it into a series. All right. Well, let's move on.

02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:19.400
Loki, we have a couple more stories before we get to the listener roundtable. Loki.

02:26:20.520 --> 02:26:24.360
People need to leave Sakurai alone. I mean, he's just a perfectionist. A little too much

02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:31.960
of a perfectionist, though, because his original scope for the adding Steve and the Minecraft

02:26:31.960 --> 02:26:38.200
characters to Smash Ultimate was he wanted to allow players to create their own Minecraft

02:26:38.200 --> 02:26:43.480
levels and be able to import them into Smash. That's crazy. Obviously. Obviously, that was not

02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:49.640
something that was implemented. Welcome to my Minecraft level dungeon of dicks.

02:26:49.640 --> 02:26:53.080
Because you know, that's what they would have done.

02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:59.160
It was too difficult in development to get it working. And so he just didn't end up having

02:26:59.160 --> 02:27:06.920
something, you know, like that implemented. But. I mean, it's fine that Sakurai opted to take a nap

02:27:07.800 --> 02:27:11.400
and he earned it, so leave him alone. Like, I could do all this extra stuff

02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:15.400
or it could take a nap and nap is probably a better thing. Honestly,

02:27:15.400 --> 02:27:17.640
he earned it. Don't give him shit. I will fight you.

02:27:20.600 --> 02:27:24.760
All right. So can you imagine what that would have looked like if actual Minecraft was?

02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:27.320
I think that was just a bad idea to begin with, because, you know,

02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:33.160
people are going to do Booby Stadium, Dungeon of Dicks, you name it, somebody's going to do it.

02:27:33.160 --> 02:27:38.920
So it's probably for the best that they didn't, you know, didn't do it. All right.

02:27:38.920 --> 02:27:44.920
Yeah. Moving on. This is a this is a nice one to end the show on a little bit. We still have

02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:51.080
Listener Roundtable coming up. But for our last news story here, the PlayStation 2 is celebrating

02:27:51.080 --> 02:27:57.880
an anniversary. That's right. The PlayStation 2 is 20 years old this week. The PlayStation 2

02:27:57.880 --> 02:28:02.840
came out 20 years ago in North America. So I know some of you want to get technical with the

02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:07.560
Japanese release and all that good stuff. But obviously, a lot of people looking back fondly

02:28:07.560 --> 02:28:12.280
on the PlayStation 2 as one of the greatest consoles of all time. You know, yes, even

02:28:12.280 --> 02:28:17.240
counting Super Nintendo and Dreamcast and all your other faves. You know, PlayStation 2 brought

02:28:17.240 --> 02:28:21.800
us a lot of huge series when we talk about things like God of War, you know, just how Metal Gear

02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:25.640
Solid, although, yes, the original was on the PlayStation, the sequels really upped the game

02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:32.520
and so on. Like, was there a game that just really defined the PlayStation 2 for you, Loki?

02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:45.400
I mean, a lot of like Grand Theft Auto 3 and 4, or I'm sorry, 3 and Vice City, San Andreas.

02:28:45.400 --> 02:28:50.600
I mean, those are pretty big. Dance Dance Revolution, a lot of the games we played on there.

02:28:50.600 --> 02:28:56.520
Honestly, BeatMania 2DX, even though that was in Japan. Like for me, those games really defined

02:28:56.520 --> 02:29:01.560
that era and like why I had a Japanese PlayStation 2 before I had an American one because of that.

02:29:01.560 --> 02:29:07.720
A lot of like the early stuff I want to say, because, you know, back the PlayStation was also,

02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:15.560
well, I didn't have Final Fantasy XI on it, but I did have the HD loader, so that was fun,

02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:20.840
you know, loading games on with that. Oh, yes. Here's some answers from chat. Bobby Blackwolf

02:29:20.840 --> 02:29:28.920
says Kadamari Damacy. W04 says all the Clover Studio games were mint. Vidpower says PlayStation

02:29:28.920 --> 02:29:35.960
2 was a great console and a great DVD player. That's very true. That is why that thing sold

02:29:35.960 --> 02:29:41.640
buku bananas because, you know, putting the DVD stuff in there was a great idea. Sacred Jade says

02:29:41.640 --> 02:29:51.400
Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance and Deception. So, yes. And Magic Pen Gel from me. That was a

02:29:51.400 --> 02:29:56.680
PlayStation 2 all time great. Although, you know, I've always been a sucker for Final Fantasy games.

02:29:56.680 --> 02:30:03.240
So, I mean, Final Fantasy X was huge. XII was great. And, of course, XI online. PlayStation 2,

02:30:03.240 --> 02:30:07.880
that game was made for PlayStation 2, really. The PC was kind of secondary. By the time we got it

02:30:07.880 --> 02:30:12.120
in the US, we got it with the first expansion. That game was really made for the PlayStation 2

02:30:12.120 --> 02:30:17.560
in Japan. So, that's a big one too. Some other music games coming in from Bobby saying Mad

02:30:17.560 --> 02:30:23.880
Maestro and Guitar Man. So, yeah. Good answers, guys. Good answers. So, looking back on the

02:30:23.880 --> 02:30:30.760
PlayStation 2 and yes, you're old because the PlayStation 2 just turned 20. Now, how old are

02:30:30.760 --> 02:30:37.000
you? How old were you when you got a PlayStation 2? Add 20 to it. All right. You're welcome.

02:30:37.880 --> 02:30:45.080
Let's move on to the listener roundtable. If you have questions in chat or comments or think

02:30:45.080 --> 02:30:49.400
probably going to be cursing me out after what I just said. But things you want to talk about here

02:30:49.400 --> 02:30:53.640
on air, please, by all means, leave those questions and comments in chat. I'll get to as many of those

02:30:53.640 --> 02:30:59.960
as I can. But as part of the roundtable, I also want to get to the mailbag. So, let's get to the

02:30:59.960 --> 02:31:05.720
mailbag tonight. And we do have a couple of emails tonight here. And first, I want to mention this

02:31:05.720 --> 02:31:11.720
because Bobby can't resist a cheap plug here. But it's a good plug and I will allow it. Saying,

02:31:11.720 --> 02:31:17.320
thing you're looking forward to in Awesome Games Done Quick, where do we mention on last week's

02:31:17.320 --> 02:31:22.120
show? I thought we did. If we didn't, then I'll say it. Bobby is going to be a full host for the

02:31:22.120 --> 02:31:29.640
next one. He was a pinch hitter host on the Summer Games event. And he did one hosting stint on the

02:31:29.640 --> 02:31:35.240
Devil May Cry 4 speed run. But he's going to get a full shift this time. He's going to be doing

02:31:35.240 --> 02:31:41.240
multiple games for Awesome Games. That's great. Congrats, Bobby. And yes, I did look at the list

02:31:41.240 --> 02:31:45.800
earlier this week. And the thing that caught my eye that I hope Bobby gets to voice, although I'm

02:31:45.800 --> 02:31:52.360
sure lots of people will be wanting to do it, is the Beat Saber Showcase in VR. Even though I know

02:31:52.360 --> 02:31:59.480
Bobby doesn't like those super crazy hard levels, but I think if somebody else is doing it and is

02:31:59.480 --> 02:32:05.080
doing it very well, it'll be an awesome thing to kind of look at, watch and talk about. So, for me,

02:32:05.080 --> 02:32:09.000
that Beat Saber expert thing definitely caught my eye. And I hope they don't put that three o'clock

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:13.640
in the morning my time. I hope it is a primetime event that I'll be able to watch. I also think it's

02:32:13.640 --> 02:32:17.880
interesting they have things like BPM, Bullets Per Minute, where that's like a very recent game.

02:32:17.880 --> 02:32:23.400
Although, I mean, the game's done quick event, they put out new games are in it all the time.

02:32:23.400 --> 02:32:27.560
So that's pretty cool. I don't know if you got a chance to look at the list, Loki, but is there

02:32:27.560 --> 02:32:31.960
any speed run you're looking forward to? I'm looking at it right now. The Diablo 3 one caught

02:32:31.960 --> 02:32:38.600
my eye too, because Diablo 3 is very random in many ways. Like the maps can be very random. So

02:32:38.600 --> 02:32:45.880
I'm kind of curious about the speed run strategy. I imagine there's certain ways you can kind of

02:32:45.880 --> 02:32:54.040
tell the seed and things like that. So I'm curious to how that'll work. Yeah, I don't know if there's

02:32:54.040 --> 02:33:00.120
anything like I'm super hyped to see. I was hoping they'd have another Minecraft run, but they have

02:33:00.120 --> 02:33:04.360
Minecraft Dungeons, which would be interesting. So I'll check that out. I like Minecraft Dungeons.

02:33:04.920 --> 02:33:09.240
It's like an old school Diablo. Yeah, so that'd be interesting to see.

02:33:12.840 --> 02:33:20.120
Yeah, I don't know. Does anyone run the Burger King games? Because I would really like to see

02:33:20.120 --> 02:33:25.320
that. Loki, you're going to be the first. You need to work on that. No, I don't have them anymore. I

02:33:25.320 --> 02:33:30.520
only have a Pocket Bike Racing, and that was literally the worst one of the bunch. I think I

02:33:30.520 --> 02:33:36.040
have a copy of Sneak King still, and it should be backwards compatible. I don't know. I've never

02:33:36.040 --> 02:33:42.760
tried. It should be, you know, because they have both the Xbox and Xbox 360 versions on the same

02:33:42.760 --> 02:33:47.960
disk. Loki, Loki, hell with your game. To hell with your game. You need to be the world speed

02:33:47.960 --> 02:33:53.000
run champion of Sneak King. No, I don't want to do that. It was funny though. Actually, I like

02:33:53.000 --> 02:34:00.120
somebody I follow who's a game developer. This guy named Danny who streams a lot on, or he does a lot

02:34:00.120 --> 02:34:06.440
of YouTube stuff, and he's actually been dedicating himself to try to become a Minecraft speedrunner.

02:34:06.440 --> 02:34:10.520
I was like, yeah, you know, he could do it. I probably could do it too. I just still, so the

02:34:10.520 --> 02:34:16.360
problem is I don't use mousey keyboard a lot for anything PC, so I'm already at a disadvantage

02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:22.520
because I never was really kind of, I'm not used to using the mouse and keyboard, so I'd have to

02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:28.760
get used to that, and that's a whole learning curve right there, but I like watching them.

02:34:29.480 --> 02:34:33.640
All right, let's get to some emails. We did get some emails tonight. Participate

02:34:33.640 --> 02:34:39.400
at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, and we're going to read some on the air. So we have Amish

02:34:39.400 --> 02:34:46.040
with our first email tonight. Hello, hello. Saying, dear OLR, hi. Amish here, or Michikins on Twitch.

02:34:46.040 --> 02:34:49.880
First and foremost, I'd like to ask you that you please excuse any spelling and grammar mistakes,

02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:56.120
as my spelling and grammar are horrible. Well, lucky you got me tonight. Just teasing, maybe.

02:34:56.120 --> 02:35:01.800
All right, so moving on. No worries. I have bad spelling and grammar because text messages have

02:35:01.800 --> 02:35:07.800
ruined me, as I think they've ruined a lot of people. Anyway, now down to brass tacks. So

02:35:07.800 --> 02:35:13.800
I've been watching the show since maybe early 2000-ish, and I have to say I am a long-time fan.

02:35:13.800 --> 02:35:19.880
That is a very long time. So we started in the early 2000s, so thank you so much for being here

02:35:19.880 --> 02:35:24.360
and being a part of it. Thank you, thank you. I may not always participate, but I do listen to

02:35:24.360 --> 02:35:29.240
every show. I just wanted to let you know you are all doing a great job at uplifting every gamer's

02:35:29.240 --> 02:35:33.800
voice and letting them be heard. That means a lot that somebody would call that out and acknowledge

02:35:33.800 --> 02:35:38.600
that. So thank you very much, Amish. I appreciate that. I'm saying, continuing on with the email.

02:35:38.600 --> 02:35:43.800
Anyway, what I was writing about was that recently you discussed inclusion of the disabled in games.

02:35:44.360 --> 02:35:49.400
Well, recently I purchased Watch Dogs Legion and discovered they have closed captioning in the

02:35:49.400 --> 02:35:54.760
game's menu. When you boot up the game, or is it load the game now? Yeah, I'm that old that I still

02:35:54.760 --> 02:36:01.320
spell disc to mean disc and boot to mean load. Anyway, well, as long as you're not saying when I

02:36:01.320 --> 02:36:07.400
load star comma eight comma one the game. That's an old C64 reference. I'll leave it at that. I

02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:11.400
think people say boot load. I think we all know what you mean. So it's interchangeable, really.

02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:17.960
It has the option to use captions and voice when playing the game. I thought that was really neat.

02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:23.960
The game literally reads, that's the voice part, what's on the screen for the visually impaired.

02:36:23.960 --> 02:36:29.160
That is really cool because I know we have folks who are visually impaired who have listened to

02:36:29.160 --> 02:36:34.440
OLR in the past. I don't know if they're listening this week, but I know that type of accessibility

02:36:34.440 --> 02:36:40.360
really allows them to play more games. And I am all about games are for everyone. So when a

02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:44.920
developer takes the time to put that in their game, I think that means a lot to a lot of people.

02:36:44.920 --> 02:36:49.640
So I think that's rad. And I'm glad you called that out so that, you know, if Watch Dogs Legion

02:36:49.640 --> 02:36:55.160
maybe wasn't on your radar and maybe you have a disability that this could really help you,

02:36:55.880 --> 02:37:01.400
we should put that game on people's radar. That's great. Meaning text and actions, which I think is

02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:06.840
cool. Hopefully more games will include such info to help more and more disabled gamers out there.

02:37:06.840 --> 02:37:11.560
Well, have a good day. Sincerely, Mish. Thank you so much for the email, Mish. Thank you for the

02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:17.080
kind words about the show, of course. And thank you for the FYI that Watch Dogs Legion has some

02:37:17.080 --> 02:37:24.920
pretty awesome accessibility issues. Really appreciate that. Cool, cool. And I gotta say,

02:37:24.920 --> 02:37:29.720
you know what? Even when it comes to things like closed captioning, now I know that's different.

02:37:29.720 --> 02:37:33.560
You were kind of talking about that there's like voices that'll narrate what's on screen,

02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:38.360
kind of like, I don't know if you guys know this, but there will oftentimes be showings of movies

02:37:38.360 --> 02:37:43.160
at the theater or like things you can get where there's like an extra like earpiece you can use

02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:47.080
that if you are visually impaired will describe what's happening on the screen.

02:37:47.080 --> 02:37:50.440
Cause like, you know, if there's, it's an action, if you're watching Fast and the Furious or

02:37:50.440 --> 02:37:57.080
something, the dialogue in those movies is not exactly at shining point. So some say,

02:37:57.080 --> 02:38:04.360
is it just like bananas, bananas, but like fiery car explosion. I haven't watched it. So I couldn't

02:38:04.360 --> 02:38:10.040
tell you, but I think it does. I, you know, I don't want to poke fun at it because I think

02:38:10.040 --> 02:38:14.360
it is a great thing that they're doing. Um, but you know, I think they do describe a little bit

02:38:14.360 --> 02:38:18.040
more in detail what's going on. However, I will say that the reason why I brought it up, like

02:38:18.040 --> 02:38:25.320
closed captions, like I, I am a fairly abled gamer where I don't necessarily need closed captions to

02:38:25.320 --> 02:38:31.640
get through a game, but I like using them because what I do get is that I get really distracted by

02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:37.400
background noise. And sometimes it's really hard for me to isolate of one voice when there's like

02:38:37.400 --> 02:38:41.080
a lot of other stuff going on, like my brain kind of wants to go, well, what's that music? What's

02:38:41.080 --> 02:38:45.560
this? You know, it's, it's kinda like, so when the closed captioning is on the screen, I can actually

02:38:45.560 --> 02:38:51.160
kind of like focus on what the person is saying. And that I think is a great, and I will watch

02:38:51.160 --> 02:38:57.640
movies with it. And I know some people hate it. Um, but like, if you've ever watched a foreign film,

02:38:57.640 --> 02:39:02.120
you're reading that stuff anyway, which is silly. If you won't watch foreign movies, cause you have

02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:06.280
to read subtitles, then you're missing the fuck out. Cause there's a lot of great stuff out there.

02:39:06.280 --> 02:39:11.240
So, um, I will use closed captioning on, um, you know, English movies just so I can make sure I

02:39:11.240 --> 02:39:16.520
don't miss things or a funny joke or things like that. Um, Bobby Blackwell says I watch Dr. Who

02:39:16.520 --> 02:39:22.840
with closed captions because of the accents. Yeah. I mean, exactly. That's a good reason to,

02:39:22.920 --> 02:39:27.480
uh, Questbuster says I grew up with sub-titled anime, so my eyes are ready.

02:39:27.480 --> 02:39:31.880
And Questbuster also points out the first thing that Watchdogs Legion does is run you through

02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:36.760
those accessibility options, which are pretty neat. Uh, Amish is in chat. Hey Amish, who says,

02:39:36.760 --> 02:39:39.800
uh, Hey, yeah, I couldn't remember what it's called, but it literally tells you when the

02:39:39.800 --> 02:39:44.840
game starts press X button. And I thought that was neat. I use captions myself because I'm visually

02:39:44.840 --> 02:39:51.240
impaired somewhat. Uh, and they have that for Minecraft as well. W04 with a good comment too,

02:39:51.320 --> 02:39:55.480
that closed captioning is a lifesaver when you have roommates. And that could go a variety of

02:39:55.480 --> 02:39:59.320
ways because your roommates are being distracted in the background or like your roommates might be

02:39:59.320 --> 02:40:02.520
on a different schedule and trying to sleep. So you're trying to watch a movie at a really

02:40:02.520 --> 02:40:08.680
low volume. So yeah, a good call. So, uh, tiger con chat says my issues with movies with subtitles

02:40:08.680 --> 02:40:14.840
is that it distracts me from actually seeing the visuals. Well, then you can, you know, they do

02:40:14.840 --> 02:40:19.560
have dubs that are available if you want to do it that way. Sometimes it depends on the movie,

02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:25.000
or turn closed captioning off, but I, what I like is that there's an option.

02:40:26.200 --> 02:40:31.800
You can, you can do a tiger Claus way or you can do it my way. Like I think that option is great.

02:40:31.800 --> 02:40:37.560
So, all right. Um, I will get to another email here, but Loki, did you want to chime in with any

02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:42.600
last minute stories or anything here before I get to another email? Yeah. Since everyone was

02:40:42.600 --> 02:40:48.360
memeing on the fact that the Xbox series X looks like a fridge, they went ahead and made it into

02:40:48.360 --> 02:40:54.680
a fridge. So they're offering, well, they have three of them that were made three Xbox series X

02:40:54.680 --> 02:41:00.520
fridges. Um, two, they gave to influencers one they're giving away. I thought it was funny

02:41:00.520 --> 02:41:04.920
though, that they actually had a fridge that they made, or at least decked out one to look like a

02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:09.800
Xbox series X. I think that's great. I love it. I wish I was Snoop dog. Cause he got one, right?

02:41:11.160 --> 02:41:17.800
Yeah, he got one and I can't remember the tech. She's a tech streamer. She got one too. Uh,

02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:22.920
I just seen, I think, um, and yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They're giving one away.

02:41:23.960 --> 02:41:30.520
She was huge on Justin TV back in the day, if I remember right. So, uh, anyway, I,

02:41:30.520 --> 02:41:38.760
damn, I wish we were popular Loki. I want an Xbox fridge. Eight or 18 years of anything, you know,

02:41:38.760 --> 02:41:44.200
or, or was it, or is it one other one I was going to mention too. Uh, so they made the announcement,

02:41:44.200 --> 02:41:49.800
the play date is almost done. It's going to be $149 and coming out early 2021. Yeah. And then I

02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:57.720
saw, what was it? Uh, Danny over there at, uh, um, gamertag radio is like, Oh look, Hey, I got

02:41:57.720 --> 02:42:02.120
this too. It's like, okay, listen, you've gotten enough free systems already in the last few days,

02:42:02.120 --> 02:42:07.640
doing your photo shoots and all that. Cut it out. Don't hate on other people's success.

02:42:07.640 --> 02:42:11.960
Don't hate, don't hate. I'm just joking. It's just funny though. Cause like, so here's my

02:42:11.960 --> 02:42:15.960
glamour shoot out front of my apartment. Here's my glamour shoot in my apartment.

02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:19.320
They made, he made a lot of content. They got it. They got their money's worth there. Yeah.

02:42:20.040 --> 02:42:24.760
All right. Uh, let's see. Vid power and chat says, well, the Xbox series fridge be worth a

02:42:24.760 --> 02:42:29.320
lot of money in the distant future due to its rarity. Why would you ever sell it? If you were

02:42:29.320 --> 02:42:34.600
Snoop Dogg or I Justine, why would you ever sell it? I'd use it. Come on Microsoft. We're looking

02:42:34.600 --> 02:42:38.360
at getting a new house. I want a new fridge. All right. And I would love my fridge to grow,

02:42:38.360 --> 02:42:42.120
glow green like that. Like I know a lot of people associate green with the fridge and like,

02:42:42.120 --> 02:42:46.520
Oh, it's moldy or something. But no, I think, I think an Xbox would give the kitchen a nice

02:42:46.520 --> 02:42:51.320
mint flavor. Don't you? All right. Anyway, let's get to another email here and then I'll,

02:42:51.320 --> 02:42:55.640
I'll see if there's anything else low. He wants to talk about this email is coming from Y Y R

02:42:55.640 --> 02:43:01.160
over at participate at orange lawns, radio.com saying hello, LR on last week's episode,

02:43:01.160 --> 02:43:05.320
there was a discussion about whether streamers should have to pay royalties to game developers

02:43:05.320 --> 02:43:10.920
or publishers as a small indie developer myself. And I'm going to add this part,

02:43:10.920 --> 02:43:15.640
download super multitasking. Thank you. Uh, continuing the email, I found the discussion

02:43:15.640 --> 02:43:20.360
interesting and I felt compelled to weigh in as an example, it was argued that since music

02:43:20.360 --> 02:43:24.360
royalty should be paid. If music is played, why shouldn't developer be paid when their game is

02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:28.440
played. And once again, we have a situation where games are different from other forms of media.

02:43:28.440 --> 02:43:32.920
Music is obtained and paid for very differently from games. Most of us either replay music that

02:43:32.920 --> 02:43:37.720
we already own, listen to music included in the background of games we play, or hear music using

02:43:37.720 --> 02:43:43.560
a streaming service. Back in my day, you used to tape them off the radio and then play the cassette

02:43:43.560 --> 02:43:48.600
tape. Am I right? Loki. That's how we used to do it. All right. Um, where the beginning and the

02:43:48.600 --> 02:43:52.760
end are kind of missing. All right. Uh, anyway, uh, let's see what are the streaming service? Yes.

02:43:52.760 --> 02:43:57.560
Uh, if it's the latter, the streaming service pays a tiny royalty to an artist and or a publisher,

02:43:57.560 --> 02:44:00.920
but it's one of the other two options. No money changes hands at all.

02:44:01.720 --> 02:44:06.440
If a streamer decides to play one of my games on stream, they've already paid me. None of my

02:44:06.440 --> 02:44:10.280
currently released games are free to play. So in essence, they've already paid me a royalty of

02:44:10.280 --> 02:44:15.560
sorts further. I could consider it free advertising. When a streamer plays one of my games, I naturally

02:44:15.560 --> 02:44:20.200
want as much exposure as possible. So this definitely is a benefit to me. Now you could

02:44:20.200 --> 02:44:24.440
make a counter argument. What if I sell a million copies and I no longer need that exposure. The

02:44:24.440 --> 02:44:28.760
counterpoint to that is simple. This is the gaming industry. One successful game does not guarantee

02:44:28.760 --> 02:44:32.760
another. When my next release comes out, I will absolutely need to get it in front of as many

02:44:32.760 --> 02:44:37.400
eyeballs as possible. So naturally I'll want the streamers to help me out. Once again, it's a

02:44:37.400 --> 02:44:42.840
mutually beneficial relationship on both sides. Streamers get content developers get exposure.

02:44:42.840 --> 02:44:47.000
I see zero issues with it. If I'm offered a royalty in the future, maybe I'd take a small

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:52.680
one, say 2%, like the milk. I just wouldn't want to disturb that mutually beneficial relationship.

02:44:52.680 --> 02:44:58.360
So that's my two cents. And you know what? I appreciate hearing a developer perspective on

02:44:58.360 --> 02:45:04.280
that. I'm still of the feeling that it should maybe be a little bit of a choice. And again,

02:45:04.280 --> 02:45:09.160
it's not like a hard line for me. Like I'm not saying like, oh, they need to be collecting their

02:45:09.160 --> 02:45:15.000
money and all this stuff. I'm more of the mindset where I'm kind of surprised companies like

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:20.440
Nintendo haven't taken more of a stance on it and tried to be more assertive because Nintendo

02:45:20.440 --> 02:45:26.680
doesn't really need the exposure in that regard. I'm just kind of surprised we haven't really had

02:45:26.680 --> 02:45:32.280
that conversation. And we kind of have had to an extent on like YouTube, but Nintendo has really

02:45:32.280 --> 02:45:38.760
yet to like really assert it on Twitch. So maybe they do ultimately feel like, hey, the exposure,

02:45:38.760 --> 02:45:45.800
the talk, it's all ads for our game. It's a good thing in the long run. But I just kind of feel

02:45:45.800 --> 02:45:56.360
like if that shoe were to ever to drop, I'm not sure the streamers out there are as in the clear

02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:02.840
under repurposing the content with so much percentage of your own content and those

02:46:02.840 --> 02:46:08.760
sort of laws that they kind of claim as they might think. But I think at the end of the day,

02:46:08.760 --> 02:46:13.960
and I think common ground that I do have with everybody in this scenario is that we need to

02:46:13.960 --> 02:46:18.520
take another look at this law because the trademark, the patent, the copyright and all

02:46:18.520 --> 02:46:23.320
this law we're working with is from a very different era when these sorts of technologies

02:46:23.320 --> 02:46:27.480
didn't exist. And we need to kind of examine this law as a whole. So we don't have a fucking gray

02:46:27.480 --> 02:46:31.320
area so that we're not asking these types of questions as to like, what is a person entitled

02:46:31.320 --> 02:46:35.320
to and dah, dah, dah, dah, and all this stuff. So that's where my head is at with it, honestly,

02:46:35.320 --> 02:46:40.200
at the end of the day. So yeah, and Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, fair use in video games

02:46:40.200 --> 02:46:45.000
has never gone in front of a judge. So we don't know if it's legal or not yet. And that's what

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:51.560
I'm saying is that look, I love streaming too, but I'm of this reality where it's like, you know

02:46:51.560 --> 02:46:58.520
what? The shoe might drop someday, but, and I'll end with this and I'll move on with the rest of

02:46:58.520 --> 02:47:03.720
YYIR's email. If that shoe were to drop and I couldn't stream Nintendo games anymore, I keep

02:47:03.720 --> 02:47:08.040
making them the bad guy and I'm only doing it because of that history with YouTube and everything

02:47:08.040 --> 02:47:13.800
they tried to pull there. It makes it easy to point at them as the bad guy first. But if YYIR

02:47:13.800 --> 02:47:19.720
were to come out and say, look, I know the law allows me to collect, but as an indie developer,

02:47:19.720 --> 02:47:24.200
I'm not going to because of all these reasons I just stated in the OLR email, then guess what

02:47:24.200 --> 02:47:30.680
YYIR, I'm playing your game. And I bet a lot of streamers would feel the same way. So, and I think

02:47:30.680 --> 02:47:34.840
at the end of the day, and that is kind of where I landed last week is that you can make it an

02:47:34.840 --> 02:47:39.720
option, but at the end of the day, streamers, if there's companies out there that say we realize

02:47:39.720 --> 02:47:44.680
we could collect if we wanted to, we're not going to, to encourage you to play our game,

02:47:44.680 --> 02:47:48.680
then streamers are going to follow suit. And I really think at the end of the day,

02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:52.520
that's what's going to happen. Okay. So I think, I hope you hear the common ground that I really

02:47:52.520 --> 02:47:57.000
think we kind of both have, but I'd love to hear your perspective as somebody who develops and

02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:02.120
quite frankly has had their games streamed by me and other people out there, as you were talking

02:48:02.120 --> 02:48:06.360
about in a previous email, which is always cool to see. All right. Onto another topic from YYIR.

02:48:07.320 --> 02:48:13.800
I'll end by saying that I'm deeply disturbed and highly offended by a comment Rob made last week.

02:48:14.760 --> 02:48:22.280
Well, he dared to say that White Castle burgers were gross. Rob, you take that back. You take

02:48:22.280 --> 02:48:27.320
that back right now, or I will be all over you like mayonnaise on French fries or not.

02:48:28.520 --> 02:48:38.360
My official response is I said what I said. That is my response. White Castle burgers are gross.

02:48:38.360 --> 02:48:42.840
You know why they're gross? And I think it's why I don't really like McDonald's burgers that much

02:48:42.840 --> 02:48:50.760
either. It's that steam cooking that they do at White Castle. It's gross. Now look,

02:48:52.200 --> 02:48:57.640
I wasn't high when I ate them in Vegas and maybe if I had been, I would have enjoyed it more.

02:48:57.640 --> 02:49:02.840
Not that I'm saying you are, but I'm just saying. I am disappointed that their closest restaurant

02:49:02.840 --> 02:49:08.520
is in Vegas, but yeah, go on. Yeah. And that's where I had them for the first time was in Vegas.

02:49:08.600 --> 02:49:14.520
So, there is that. S2100 Matt says, I mean, Rob wasn't wrong. Thank you, Matt. Appreciate

02:49:14.520 --> 02:49:21.560
you being in my quarter. W04 says do not back down, Rob. I won't. This is my hill and I'm dying

02:49:21.560 --> 02:49:27.160
on it. White Castle is overrated, but W04 does follow up saying in and out over everything.

02:49:27.160 --> 02:49:30.760
Maybe it's because I live in California, but like in and out. In and out is good.

02:49:30.760 --> 02:49:38.440
I don't dislike in and out by any means, but I feel like I only eat it when people are visiting

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:42.520
want to have in and out because they can never have it. And that's enough for me.

02:49:42.520 --> 02:49:48.840
Like it's very rare that I'm like craving in and out. You know what I mean? I'm usually more,

02:49:48.840 --> 02:49:53.720
I'm more now into places like Smashburger and like those types of places that kind of

02:49:53.720 --> 02:49:58.840
Chipotle-ed the burger by doing and Shake Shack. We actually have a Shake Shack here in SAC now.

02:49:58.840 --> 02:50:04.760
That came up on a previous episode and I like going there. I like the slightly more upscale.

02:50:05.400 --> 02:50:11.560
Um, I do think as far as like, but see steaming the burgers, see, uh, DJ Rama S says, bro,

02:50:11.560 --> 02:50:15.880
steam burgers are the best. Hard disagree. I'm sorry. Like if I, if I have to eat a fast food

02:50:15.880 --> 02:50:20.840
burger and I know now I know I'm going to get screamed at if I'm talking like fast food,

02:50:21.560 --> 02:50:27.240
honestly, like the way Burger King does it with the flame grill is way better than like

02:50:27.240 --> 02:50:33.080
McDonald's or White Castle. That is, that is the way to do it. So that's my opinion. All right.

02:50:35.480 --> 02:50:41.160
Uh, let's see. So lastly from YYR, uh, thanks again for the show. Election day seemed to be

02:50:41.160 --> 02:50:46.600
miles away and here it is just two days out. We've made it this far. Hope you all continue

02:50:46.600 --> 02:50:53.720
to hang in there. I'm trying. Hugs, Aaron, YYR. Thank you. It's uh, it's, it's been a crazy year

02:50:53.720 --> 02:51:00.760
and like, honestly, I'm sitting here going, what can I do on Tuesday night that will not like,

02:51:00.760 --> 02:51:06.360
and like the easy answer is play video games, but like where I am not even tempted to flip the

02:51:06.360 --> 02:51:11.800
channel and obsess over the map as the vote tallies are coming in. And, you know, my,

02:51:11.800 --> 02:51:16.760
my own feelings on all of this, like, what can I just like, I seriously just want to get in the car

02:51:16.760 --> 02:51:21.000
and drive to the forest and go camping or look at stars or something that night, just

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:26.760
so I am nowhere near your, you're going to go to the Fort. Yes. I'm going to go to the Fort.

02:51:26.760 --> 02:51:35.400
All right. Uh, any other last minute stories for us? Thank you for the email YYR.

02:51:36.680 --> 02:51:41.640
Um, no, I don't really have anything else. All right. Then I think we're going to wrap up the

02:51:41.640 --> 02:51:46.040
show. So, uh, that's it. Thank you guys so much for listening to Orange Launch Radio. I appreciate

02:51:46.040 --> 02:51:51.960
you participating along with the show. Uh, thank you so much. Uh, we are the show where every gamer

02:51:51.960 --> 02:51:55.000
has a voice. So if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, tell a friend,

02:51:55.000 --> 02:52:01.000
uh, help us spread the word, um, tell a friend or two about the show, a nice tweet, an auto host on

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:06.520
Twitch goes a long way. I still can't see the host cause I'm logged in with the wrong account, but,

02:52:06.520 --> 02:52:10.680
uh, I'll have to talk to Bobby if maybe I should switch over to the main account when I do this so

02:52:10.680 --> 02:52:16.920
I can see the host. Um, but yeah, thank you guys so much for that. Um, uh, for, for the hosts and

02:52:16.920 --> 02:52:20.280
all that stuff and those that go the extra mile with the follows and the bits and subs and all

02:52:20.280 --> 02:52:24.360
that really appreciate you. And I'll, I'll shout those out after the show here, uh, live on Twitch.

02:52:24.360 --> 02:52:29.960
Um, and thanks. Thanks for, um, uh, giving us something to look forward to in these pandemic-y

02:52:29.960 --> 02:52:34.920
times where it's like, ah, I'm stuck at home all the time, nothing to do, but the show gives me

02:52:34.920 --> 02:52:39.880
something to look forward to. So I really appreciate that. All right. Um, final thoughts

02:52:39.880 --> 02:52:46.360
time. Loki, how about you? Your final thought? Just going to keep working on my game. Sounds

02:52:46.360 --> 02:52:53.160
like a way to do it. Make making progress. All right. And my final thought is, um, whatever

02:52:53.160 --> 02:52:59.720
happens on Tuesday, it's going to be fine. No matter which side of the fence you're on politically,

02:52:59.720 --> 02:53:07.080
it's gonna, it might feel very bad. Um, but you know, and I've said this on a previous episode

02:53:07.080 --> 02:53:11.560
about you all know my love of drag queens and things like that. And I, I kind of ending with

02:53:11.560 --> 02:53:17.480
my final thought as something like Katya said on an episode of All Stars 2 that has not left my

02:53:17.480 --> 02:53:23.000
mind since then, uh, is when she says, she looks in the mirror and she says, I'm not going to panic

02:53:23.560 --> 02:53:30.280
because I don't do that anymore. So that is my mindset going into whatever may come this week.

02:53:30.280 --> 02:53:36.520
And, um, and 2020 in general, because even if the election does go the way I want it to,

02:53:36.520 --> 02:53:39.320
and I'm talking up and down the ballot with propositions and everything else that I'm,

02:53:39.320 --> 02:53:47.960
I'm looking at, not just the, not just the big one. Um, I, I just, yeah, I'm not gonna panic

02:53:47.960 --> 02:53:52.520
about a lot of stuff that I don't, I can't control. So that's, that's it. Yeah. And pod

02:53:52.520 --> 02:53:57.800
culture and chat says, it's going to be ugly no matter how things go. And I think that is true.

02:53:57.800 --> 02:54:03.160
Act F says, if we have endured 2020 so far, we can make this work. And I hope so. And I hope the one

02:54:03.160 --> 02:54:11.000
positive thing about this extremely negative year is that humanity can evolve as a result of it.

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:14.600
If that makes sense, we're going to become smarter together and stronger together,

02:54:15.800 --> 02:54:22.440
hopefully. And I'll leave you on that thought. So, um, enjoy playing your games, enjoy, uh,

02:54:22.440 --> 02:54:29.240
the next, um, you know, seven days of gaming, enjoy, uh, this week, you know, uh, and enjoy

02:54:29.240 --> 02:54:34.440
looking forward to the next consoles, PlayStation five, uh, and Xbox series X and all that good

02:54:34.440 --> 02:54:40.840
stuff. Have a wonderful week. You guys we'll see you next time. Good night. You've been listening
