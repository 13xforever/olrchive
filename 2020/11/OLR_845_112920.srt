00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,520
This week, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has nice things to say about Sony's design and ingenuity,

2
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,800
a nod to the Wii, and doesn't mince words on toxicity and tribalism.

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,880
There's being competitive, and then there's being abrasive.

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,520
Every console, game, remaster, re-release, online service is just a matter of choices

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,840
by the creators, and those choices don't necessarily make sense to anyone else not

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,040
part of the process.

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,880
Joining Phil's words come the words of your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki,

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,880
about this and the rest of the week's news, starting right now in the show, where every

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,880
gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,240
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:53,240
every gamer has a voice, another episode of Orange Lounge Radio starting right now here

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,200
live at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network where we do tape live every

13
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,040
Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,040
show.

15
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,320
It is episode number 845 for this November the 29th of 2020.

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,840
My name is Rob Roberts.

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,320
Not joining me tonight sadly is Dark Sakura or Jamie Sommers.

18
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,160
She is off for tonight because it is her husband Dan's birthday, and they are doing birthday

19
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,440
things, you know, things that you can do in quarantine outside with friends and stuff,

20
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,040
but taking the night off to be with her hubby on his birthday, and hope they're enjoying

21
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,040
the night.

22
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,400
But joining me live, as he does pretty much every week, say hello to tech master Loki.

23
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,400
Hello.

24
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
Hi, Loki.

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,400
How are you?

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,400
I'm doing fine.

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,400
Did you have a good Thanksgiving?

28
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Yeah, it was busy.

29
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,400
I cooked dinner.

30
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,400
So that took like six hours.

31
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,400
Turkey.

32
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:53,880
So yeah, it was like turkey mashed potatoes stuffing, glazed carrots, creamy casserole

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,880
and giblet gravy.

34
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,880
Oh, wow.

35
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,720
Wow.

36
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,720
So yeah.

37
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,720
I never cooked for turkey before.

38
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,720
So that was fun.

39
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,760
And Thanksgiving was different for a lot of people this year, I think, because of everything

40
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
going on.

41
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,000
Was it just you, your immediate household, or did you go over to like Nellie's?

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh, okay.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I thought maybe you would have spent time with the wife's mom.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,240
I mean, I did go over to her parents house to drop off some food after we're done, but

45
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,360
yeah, the drop off thing is big too.

46
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,480
I think a lot of like, I know some families were doing like Thanksgiving to go and things

47
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,480
like that.

48
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,960
So obviously, we had a very scaled down year.

49
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,560
We usually don't do anything, especially ever since my mom passed away, which about three

50
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,320
years ago, Thanksgiving has been pretty low key, but it was just myself, Alan and my dad.

51
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,880
And we knew we'd have to mix with my dad.

52
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,000
And that's why, you know, in the weeks leading up to it, I was very careful not to go out

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,440
and do anything irresponsible.

54
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,700
And ironically, I ended up having another COVID test on Monday, because I woke up Monday

55
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,860
and I was like, I'm playing the new 2020 game.

56
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,980
Is it allergies?

57
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,980
Is it COVID?

58
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,980
I don't know.

59
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,660
So it turns out it was allergies, at least according to the test.

60
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,660
So that made me feel a lot better actually.

61
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,660
And we did the outdoor dining thing, but it felt comfortable.

62
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,260
Like I know that's a little bit nervous because in some places it can still be pretty packed

63
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,260
together.

64
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,540
But the nice thing is a lot of restaurants out here in suburbia, at least the outdoor

65
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,140
dining is really space because they took over half the parking lot because all the

66
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,660
other places are closed.

67
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,180
So half the parking lot is their tables and they're like super spaced out and it was really

68
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,180
nice.

69
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,440
So that was nice.

70
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,880
So it was just us, small Thanksgiving, but I'm totally okay with that.

71
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,980
So I hope all of you out there had a great Thanksgiving as well.

72
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,880
And, you know, despite the fact it was probably a little different this year, if you did go

73
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,900
to a big family thing because you couldn't get out of it, I understand how the family,

74
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,620
I know I kind of went on a rant at the end of last night's show, but that was for people

75
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,260
who were flaunting it.

76
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,860
I understand some people have no choice and they may have had to go to the big family

77
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,700
thing against their will because family pressure kind of stinks sometimes.

78
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,700
Totally get that.

79
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:08,060
And, you know, hope you're able to spend some time alone in quarantine over the next week

80
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,380
and a half.

81
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,540
Plenty of video games available to help you pass the time.

82
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,340
Plenty of fine podcasts and broadcasting just like ours out there to help you pass the time

83
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,740
as well.

84
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:25,060
At least the nice thing is about the world situation in the year 2020, as opposed to

85
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,780
the year 1920 or really more like 1918.

86
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,860
There's much more to do online and things you can do in your house, right?

87
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,700
So yeah, it's nice.

88
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,900
Have you been able to, I'll get into our gaming week soon, but you know, since it is a long

89
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,820
weekend and I imagine you didn't work Thursday, Friday, like a lot of people with the typical

90
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,020
nine to fives, which by the way, thoughts are with all of our friends in the retail

91
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,460
sector who did not get the days off back to back.

92
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,500
Hope you, I heard it was like, I didn't see the fistfight videos and all that stuff.

93
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,380
Unfortunately there was a shooting at the mall here, but that seems completely isolated

94
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,460
from the fact that it was Black Friday.

95
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,620
I hope everybody out there in the retail world, I hope y'all made it through okay.

96
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,460
Cause I'm sure it wasn't easy this year, but I know a lot of folks, office jobs had the

97
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,200
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday off.

98
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,560
And I was thinking, wow, Loki, that might be a lot of time for you to work on your game.

99
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,800
Was it a good, was it a good crunch time for your game?

100
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,040
Yeah, it was, it was, it was fun.

101
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,680
So I got a lot done.

102
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,960
A lot of the code stuff I needed to get done is now done now.

103
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:38,360
So I've been lately working on just art and music stuff to go in to, I just padding up

104
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,360
what I had already.

105
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:48,600
Cause I have like art and music and sound effects already, but it's just, I needed more.

106
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Interesting.

107
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,080
Do you think you might, when do you think you're going to be ready to unveil this?

108
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,800
Do you think it might be ready next week?

109
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,440
Cause you don't know about this, but I'm about to announce something a little later in the

110
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,440
show for next week.

111
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,080
I mean, I mean, hopefully soon I, I, I know I said I wanted to get it done this year.

112
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,680
So I'm like, I'm really like every day.

113
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:14,960
So like I, I, I, I, I, I'm hoping very soon, but like, like I don't want to, I don't want

114
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,080
to put out a yellow text or yellow background tweet or anything.

115
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,480
So, you know, I get it.

116
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,480
No, it's admirable.

117
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,480
It's admirable.

118
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,160
And no, that's good because you know, with time to car, you were kind of showing a little

119
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,000
bit of the detail and then you were like, eh, he kind of got rid of it.

120
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,400
So that was a whole different thing.

121
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,960
So that, yeah, that one, it was, it was work working on it.

122
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,400
And then, um, it just like, I, I kind of went the wrong way with that.

123
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,800
Like I did all the art stuff and kind of got bad, but then it wasn't fun.

124
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,840
So that was the problem was like, why am I working on this?

125
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,520
If it's not really that fun to play and then it just kind of like lost the, the, the idea

126
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,520
for it.

127
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,520
And then, you know, now, uh, you know, what the golf came out and that's basically the

128
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,200
game anyways, you know, the driving stuff is kind of like that.

129
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,560
So all right, I'll need to make that.

130
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,920
Well, I'm excited to see whatever it is you have in store whenever you're ready.

131
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,040
I do think it's admirable that you are waiting until like your releases penny.

132
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,720
I think sometimes in the games industry, we wish it was this way.

133
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,920
Like don't show it off until you're ready to go.

134
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,920
We understand there's gotta be hype, there's gonna be pre-orders and things like that,

135
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,560
but you know what, at least when you announced just before you release, it's like, you know,

136
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,560
it's coming, you know, it's done.

137
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,560
There you go.

138
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:35,120
At least just like, yeah, just to where I know that, like, I have a momentum to where

139
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,520
I should be able to get it done.

140
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,440
The good news though, like as I've been posting, like kind of big updates online is that like

141
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,380
code wise, like I've hit my minimal viable already.

142
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:50,800
So like I have a full game loop with like, you know, I can start the game, I can lose

143
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,920
the game, I can win the game, you know, everything works as far as that goes.

144
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,360
And I got the core, like gameplay elements I wanted in there.

145
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,040
And then now it's just all the additional stuff.

146
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,240
Whereas before it's like, I'm going to add all this stuff in there and then I can't finish

147
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,400
everything.

148
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,880
So like time to car kind of helped you learn, even though literally everybody in chat was

149
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,480
telling you, don't do something like that for your first game.

150
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:20,720
At least you still had that experience of, I learned some things about what I did like

151
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,720
about the process, what I didn't like that you've been able to apply here.

152
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,600
And it sounds to me like, well, you, you have a, you have a done game at this point.

153
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,640
You have something you could release, but it's not up to the level you want it to be

154
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,640
at.

155
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,640
Am I right?

156
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
Yeah.

157
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,640
Yeah.

158
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,440
I mean, it's, it's definitely not able to be released yet, but you can play it.

159
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:47,480
And I'd like to say that I learned my lesson with the last game, but I didn't.

160
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,480
So like I didn't necessarily follow the best advice for that stuff, but yeah, you'll see

161
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
it.

162
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,480
It'll turn out great.

163
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
I'm sure.

164
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,480
All right.

165
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,080
I go into our chat because again, we do tape live on Sunday nights over at VOG network,

166
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,160
twitch.tv slash VOG network and Akuma JP is in chat.

167
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,400
Always love to see him saying, so is it really coming or is it cyberpunk coming out?

168
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,440
Uh, that's the, uh, the problem there.

169
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,560
Cause cyberpunk is coming out in a couple of weeks here.

170
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,840
So it's like, which will be here first.

171
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,840
That's the question.

172
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
Okay.

173
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,920
But like, that's going to be a huge distraction, but, um, yeah, we'll see.

174
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,920
We'll push through it.

175
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,920
All right.

176
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
Sounds good.

177
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,600
Uh, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic here, uh, and talk about, um, some comments

178
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,880
made by Phil Spencer, who someone I, you know, I've, I've talked pretty favorably of him

179
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:42,480
on the show previously, but he really is becoming a voice I like to hear from, you know, I gotta

180
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,480
be honest.

181
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,360
There's some people in gaming where I find, I don't like to hear from them as much.

182
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,760
Uh, and I, I, I'm not going to live in a negative place.

183
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm not going to tell you who, but you can guess, um, but this is one of those people

184
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,880
I like to hear from because the more he kind of gives his insight on the gaming industry,

185
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
the more I like it.

186
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,400
I was just commenting to Bobby at the end of his show, you know, the gaming industry

187
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,800
has been kind of missing somebody like Reggie Fils-Aime, right?

188
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,400
Everybody loved Reggie Fils-Aime.

189
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,400
Even if you weren't always the biggest Nintendo person, like, like Loki, like kind of loves

190
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,640
Nintendo some days and doesn't love them other days.

191
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,760
And quite frankly, I feel the same way.

192
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,080
But Reggie Fils-Aime was always like, he's just awesome.

193
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,680
He's something like, like when you think of like a guy you want in the boardroom representing

194
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,040
the game, Reggie Fils-Aime is a great guy, right?

195
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,120
And that's why a lot of people have been trying to go after him ever since he retired from

196
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,560
Nintendo right now while he's on GameStop boards.

197
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,400
But the, the industry doesn't have like a big, big voice like that, right?

198
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,840
But I find that Phil Spencer's kind of becoming that guy where I'm like, I kind of think if

199
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,940
anybody should be the flag bearer, maybe, maybe this guy, I don't know.

200
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,780
But of course, there can always be several people that you can look up to and admire.

201
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:55,100
But Phil Spencer's definitely somebody where I'm like, I am so happy he's running Xbox

202
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,420
as opposed to before, we'll just say that, before.

203
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,720
Right, yeah, I get it.

204
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,340
And so like, this is kind of coming from an interview he did with The Verge, kind of talking

205
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:13,580
about just the game industry and stuff and talking about some of this negativity that's

206
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,700
in the industry, just as a whole, or even like fans of it.

207
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,820
You see it all the time when you go online.

208
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:24,780
I mean, even like so many articles have come out, like comparing stuff, basically, you

209
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:30,900
know, the, the essence of it is, you know, wanting something, wanting the opposition

210
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:37,220
thing to fail so that the thing that you bought succeeds, you know, that, you know, you want

211
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:42,300
it to look like I bought an Xbox, so I want the PlayStation 5 to fail, you know, it, which

212
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,300
is ridiculous.

213
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,540
It's, it's kind of silly.

214
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:50,340
I mean, especially if you're a person that purchased this, you know, your consumer and

215
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,580
not necessarily the companies buying it, it's even makes less sense for you to be concerned

216
00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:00,220
about whether one company succeeds or fails, unless that company is EA, in which case I

217
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:05,140
would be hoping that the loot box stuff will fail, but that'll never, ever happen.

218
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:10,740
But like, it is, it's silly basically saying, you know, I, you know, he really wants to

219
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,780
kind of embrace this, you know, wanting everybody to succeed.

220
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:20,180
And that's why you see a lot of times online, you know, every PlayStation, Xbox congratulating

221
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,180
each other.

222
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:26,580
And I don't even think necessarily you hear too much about them dogging on the other systems

223
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,580
and stuff.

224
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,380
I think they're just really focused on what their systems can do and kind of pushing that

225
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,380
up.

226
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,780
It's more of the fanboys that are kind of, you know, dogging on everybody.

227
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:43,340
It's these type of people that like do this for everything, whether it's consoles, it's

228
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:49,180
politics, it's sports teams, it's anything, it's just, you know.

229
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,660
I was going to make the comparison too, that this does happen in another industry sometimes.

230
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,580
How about the gays and pop divas?

231
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,740
And I know you see it too, Loki, you've got to see this, you know enough gay guys, and

232
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:07,140
I can speak as one, that you see this on social media where it's like, you know, oh,

233
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,580
Katy Perry, she's basic, screw her, you know, hope she's a flop.

234
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:16,220
Christina Aguilera, bionic, flop Tina, you know, like all this stuff, right?

235
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,860
And it's like, shouldn't we be lifting up all women?

236
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,620
Like shouldn't we be, you know, why does it have to be a competition?

237
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,700
Can't we be happy for all of the great...

238
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:31,380
I think people in, I don't know necessarily the psychology behind it, but I feel that

239
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:37,220
it's probably something to do with people want to feel like that they're winning sometimes.

240
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,860
And they do that maybe even vicariously through other things.

241
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:46,180
So whether it be sports teams, whether it be politics, whether it be, you know, even

242
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:50,900
game consoles or whatever, you know, back in the day when we were growing up, it was

243
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:55,220
Nintendo and Sega and it's like, oh, they suck and they suck.

244
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,180
There's another great comparison because I was going to ask if maybe some of this is

245
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:02,780
rooted in where gaming culture has come from.

246
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,740
I mean, you know, I don't have the magazines in front of me.

247
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,740
I wish I did.

248
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,420
But, you know, maybe that's a trip down memory lane we need to take at some point.

249
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,460
But like if I had some old gaming magazines, I could open them up and show you that there

250
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,900
would be these ads, giant, full page, sometimes multi-page ads that would be things like Sega

251
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:25,740
does what Nintendon't or you see an ad for like the Neo Geo that compares.

252
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,740
I think it was.

253
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,740
I'm sorry, guys.

254
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,020
I don't literally remember what ads they were, but there were some that would like show the

255
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:37,740
Nintendo fans as a baby and the Sega fans as, you know, somebody who, you know, doesn't

256
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,340
look very intelligent and so on.

257
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:45,420
And then it's like, but the TurboGrafx 16 or the Neo Geo has power, you know, and all

258
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,420
this stuff.

259
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,780
It's better for the price I'm paying for that stuff.

260
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:56,400
So yeah, this was a part of our culture that we would read a lot about in the old magazines

261
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:01,360
that now I think because it's manifested itself into something really gross that we've seen

262
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,200
happen on social media, you know, over the years is it's it.

263
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,480
That's why I love that Phil Spencer's kind of starting to put his foot down and say enough.

264
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,580
It doesn't have to be like that.

265
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,600
We can all be successful and root for each other.

266
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
Yeah.

267
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,300
And I don't I really don't get what the point is like people like dogging other people for

268
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,940
what they like in any aspect.

269
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,100
It doesn't make any sense.

270
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:32,700
You know, I don't know where they could derive pleasure from that.

271
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:38,560
I mean, maybe it's just, you know, trolling people because there's people that like trolling

272
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,980
folks for whatever reason.

273
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,980
I don't know.

274
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,900
But it is something that, you know, has gone on for a long time.

275
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,060
I don't think it's going away anytime soon.

276
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:55,980
But it is nice to see that at least the game companies are starting to take the stance

277
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:00,660
of like, maybe we shouldn't get down in the mud with all of those people.

278
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,140
Maybe we should just take the high road here and just do that.

279
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,100
Not to say that everybody has done that.

280
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:12,060
I mean, just a few years ago when Sony was doing this silly video about sharing games,

281
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,060
which is fine.

282
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,740
You know, that's a legit dig, I guess.

283
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,380
I saw that more as shade.

284
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:22,460
So now let me steal something else from my gaze, all right?

285
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,240
So that video felt more like shade to me.

286
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,600
And there's this old quote from RuPaul, and whether you love her or hate her, she's got

287
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,980
some catchy quotes.

288
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:36,980
And there's this great quote from RuPaul where it is, throwing shade takes creativity, being

289
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,500
a bitch takes none.

290
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,080
And that's the quote.

291
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:46,180
And I think when you look at those Sony commercials, they were shady, and they were creative, and

292
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:51,020
they were making a point based off of what a lot of people in the industry were really

293
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:55,980
frustrated with, which was the direction that the Xbox One was going in at the time with

294
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,660
the TV, TV, sports, sports, always online, no training, you know, and all the stuff that

295
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,540
people didn't like about the Xbox One.

296
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:07,500
But being a bitch is what I see in the comment section whenever Microsoft makes a tweet or

297
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,940
Sony makes a tweet.

298
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,260
And you've all seen it, because you all know not to read the comment section.

299
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,620
I just see a bunch of uncreative bitches.

300
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,620
That's what I see.

301
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,620
Yeah.

302
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,740
And it's people complaining about stuff that's ridiculous.

303
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:25,300
Like you're looking at game specs and like, well, this one, you know, the frame rates,

304
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:31,420
you know, it's not 120 frames per second in this game, and this one, the wall doesn't

305
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:36,340
have the fun adaptive triggers, because Sony's got that on their DualSense, so therefore

306
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,660
the Xbox controllers suck.

307
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:44,580
It's like, it's just stupid petty arguments, like, what are you, I don't know what you're

308
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,300
trying to do like that.

309
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,460
That's a debate you can have if you're deciding like, hey, I don't know which console to get

310
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,120
and you're asking your friends, you know what they recommend or what you think, you know,

311
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,340
you have your advantages and your disadvantages.

312
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,100
And if it ends up being some popular thing, like say those adaptive triggers are super

313
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:05,460
popular, then guess what the next console that comes out is going to have those things

314
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,420
because it's the same thing with like the rumble, you know, the HD rumble thing that

315
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,580
was a popular thing that was in the Joy-Con.

316
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,580
So what did Sony do?

317
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,580
They did the same thing.

318
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,500
I mean, they've done it before with like motion controls.

319
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:23,660
They like to copy Nintendo, but it's just, it's a neat innovative thing, but let's just

320
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,820
see how it's being used.

321
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,780
I mean, there was a thing that they were touting before, which I still have it, like I said,

322
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:33,660
I'm pretty new to the Xbox One stuff, but they were touting, you know, the rumble that

323
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,700
was in the triggers before it was supposed to be like some immersive thing.

324
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,500
I haven't noticed anything yet, but then again, I haven't played any games like that.

325
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,740
They have that.

326
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,220
So I don't know if that's just all hype.

327
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,340
I mean, same with the motion controls they were talking about before with the, you know,

328
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,380
the six axis, that was supposed to be a big thing.

329
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,820
We don't really see a lot of it.

330
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,460
And sometimes, Loki, it's all a marketing thing too, not so much in the case you're

331
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:01,380
talking about, but my brain went to when Sega had blast processing.

332
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:06,940
Remember when that, that was fucking made the fuck up, like that was a marketing thing.

333
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,660
And so it's, it's, it's, it's, it's like talking about, what is it?

334
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,660
Terra flops.

335
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,900
Oh, this console has more teraflop.

336
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,280
Do you even like, and this is what I want to ask these people on Twitter.

337
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,700
Do you even know what a teraflop is?

338
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,700
You teraflop?

339
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:28,300
Well, that's just teraflops or something that like, that's just, it wasn't a literal, it

340
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,300
wasn't a literal question.

341
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,300
No, no, I understand that.

342
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:36,300
But like, I think that they, it's, it's something that I see when I watch a lot of tech reviewers

343
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:41,620
and stuff, they use that as a point to kind of compare the power of the system, the potential

344
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,780
power, I guess.

345
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,280
But like, even now, like when they're saying, Oh, like people declaring that, Oh yeah, Sony's

346
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,620
won the race already.

347
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,060
Like literally a week or two after the console is launched.

348
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:56,580
And we're talking about launch games that, you know, probably don't know how to utilize

349
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,440
the hardware the best anyways.

350
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,740
And we're already drawing distinctions.

351
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,220
Oh, well, it's over for Microsoft or it's open for Sony.

352
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,600
Like, dude, it is way too early.

353
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,400
We haven't even seen the potential for these games yet.

354
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,740
And you're already trying to, you know, call the, you know, call the results of the race

355
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,160
here, which there really is no race.

356
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,640
It's just something to keep you busy, I guess.

357
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,640
Okay.

358
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,640
You're 2020.

359
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,640
Let me get to some chat comments.

360
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,720
Cause you guys are lighting up in chat and I love it.

361
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,240
At twitch.tv slash vlog network, Phoenix 77 26 describing a teraflop says it's what my

362
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,960
fat butt makes when I cannonball of a high dive.

363
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,960
Same.

364
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,800
My friend, same quest buster says teraflop equals how many pancakes are flipped per process,

365
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,320
but how many bunnies are carrying the pancakes?

366
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,440
That's what I want to tear a bunny.

367
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,460
Bobby Black Wolf says, I mean, really George Plimpton's Intellivision ads were the original

368
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:55,780
console war Intellivision once again, making history he'd have Intellivision baseball and

369
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,960
Atari 2,600 baseball and say, which one would you rather play?

370
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,720
Or once you compare, you'll know, and I remember those ads too.

371
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,040
So Intellivision is to blame for all this and how ironic that the Amico is now the family

372
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,040
friendly console.

373
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,040
Right.

374
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,040
How ironic.

375
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,040
Anyway.

376
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:19,060
Um, and black, black and Pat in chat says, why does it have to be over for anyone?

377
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,060
Great question.

378
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:24,460
And let's talk about the Amico for a second because there's a ton of people out there

379
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:31,840
already canceling this device because it's not, you know, it's, it's not there to answer

380
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:38,220
to the PlayStation five or the Xbox series X, but it's existing to its own thing.

381
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,220
It's a risk.

382
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,220
Yeah.

383
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,980
And some people say it as a risk that could go to a good place and some people say it's

384
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,980
a risk.

385
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,980
It go to a bad place.

386
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:52,620
It's a risk, but can't we hope it is if the Amico is a runaway success and sells millions

387
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,620
of Amico's.

388
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,860
You don't know, you, you don't know until it happens.

389
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,660
Is it, is it going to hurt the industry?

390
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:02,500
If the Amico is a runaway success, is that a good thing or a bad thing?

391
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,380
Because I would say the Ami you, you should want the Amico to succeed.

392
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,600
You should want all of these gaming devices to succeed because that more competition is

393
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,200
going to create better games.

394
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,320
Those more avenues to have games to play is going to make for better games.

395
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,300
Having a device which, you know, allows more gamers is going to make for a better gaming

396
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,260
culture and so on and so on.

397
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,020
Loki, I'm sorry, you wanted to comment.

398
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,020
No, no, no.

399
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,940
I was going to say like, I was thinking before with the Amico, I don't think it's going to

400
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:34,900
hurt the industry, but, and it's as much as I love Tommy and the whole team that he's

401
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:40,540
assembled to put it together and the Amico looks like a nice piece of hardware.

402
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:44,340
The games are a little sketchy looking right now.

403
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,180
They just, they, they, they come off and I know it's probably underselling it.

404
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:54,900
They come off just as small, which is, it's, it's a bad connotation cause there's great

405
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,900
mobile games out there.

406
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,940
And that doesn't mean anything about how the games are actually going to play.

407
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,420
Cause let's look at Wii Sports.

408
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:05,540
That that game was basic as hell, but it's still, it was a great game.

409
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:10,020
And so you can't really necessarily judge stuff by the games, but the problem it like

410
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:18,060
it just, a lot of this seems like Ouya and I know it's definitely different than Ouya,

411
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,860
but it's just like that, like getting excited, this is going to be revolutionary.

412
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,620
And they just like flops hard.

413
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:28,420
That's not to say that just because one did that this one's going to, it's just, that's

414
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:36,420
the kind of, I see it in that going that way right now, but that's not to say that they

415
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,220
could easily prove me wrong.

416
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:45,340
And it's just, that's my, my healthy skepticism right now about it is, is I want them to succeed,

417
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,580
It's okay to have the healthy skepticism because we do love this.

418
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,500
And I've talked about this a million times on the show.

419
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,100
I'll say it one more time because you never know who's listening for the first time this

420
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,100
week.

421
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,900
But even when we are critical about things in the industry that we really love, like

422
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,740
Nintendo, right?

423
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,040
We're critical because we are fans.

424
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,540
We want to see them do well.

425
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,580
So when they make these moves that we don't understand, that's what can be frustrating.

426
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:14,700
But any criticism we make on this show does come from a place of wanting to see them succeed.

427
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,100
And I think a lot of that is true about Amico as well.

428
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,620
And there was a great comment in chat that said, um, uh, as Joe and Hunter Matt says,

429
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:26,400
thankfully gaming success stories have come in the form of indie games breaking through.

430
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,200
And that truly is all the Amico needs.

431
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,220
If the Amico has that great indie partnership we don't know about yet and gets that breakthrough

432
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:40,020
indie game, it won't, all that other stuff you're concerned about won't matter.

433
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,340
You know what I mean?

434
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,340
It's great.

435
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,760
Having like these packing games and stuff, they're really trying to capture that whole

436
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:51,420
Wii sports market, which it's really, there's no market right now.

437
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,420
Let's be honest.

438
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:58,820
I mean, they sorta kinda, I mean, you didn't really, the Switch was popular, but it's not,

439
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,020
it didn't have that like breakthrough success.

440
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:07,940
I think like the, the weed is far as in the sense of like catering to non gamers.

441
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,860
Um, I granted, there's probably a lot of people that own the Wii that probably now

442
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:19,140
have a Switch, but it's not bringing, I think a ton of new, uh, gaming, uh, people that

443
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:25,060
are going to be into gaming now, um, with this, this isn't, you don't have a Wii sports

444
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,660
per se on the Switch right now.

445
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:33,460
Um, but I think that this could do well, especially if it's, you know, priced, you know, right.

446
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,740
That'd be interesting to see.

447
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,180
I am curious to see how stuff turns out on there.

448
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,860
Um, let, let me, let me bring up some, let me bring up something else.

449
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,860
Sorry.

450
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:45,620
Cause I, I didn't, I didn't want to turn this into the Amico hour, but let me take another

451
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,260
gaming device that I've been highly critical of on this program.

452
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:53,500
And I want to explain why and where I'm actually secretly rooting for it to be successful.

453
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:58,060
And that would be Google Stadia, I think is a very appropriate thing to address as, um,

454
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,960
I would love if this was a success.

455
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,740
I just don't think it's going to be in its current form.

456
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:07,240
And a lot of it has to do again, I think a lot of it is, it's just, it's just too soon.

457
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,860
And there's that real concern that Google is going to walk away from it just in time

458
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:16,120
to see, you know, for, for the, the rest of the industry to finally catch up to where

459
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,840
we need something like Google Stadia.

460
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,640
And a lot of it has to do with these bandwidth caps, right?

461
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,360
You know, there was a story going around this week.

462
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,300
I don't think it made our show roll tonight, so I'll talk about it real quick here.

463
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:30,760
Um, Google Stadia was showing off that cyberpunk can run in 4k and it looks really good.

464
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:34,220
But my response to that is, that's great.

465
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:39,080
But now on the other hand, you just had a story come out that said, guess what, Comcast

466
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:44,760
is bringing in those 1.2 terabyte caps to the, to the entirety of the Northeast and

467
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,800
every place that didn't have a bandwidth cap before is now going to have one.

468
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,360
And so it's like, that was a really shitty yin to the yang of the other story.

469
00:26:53,360 --> 00:27:00,120
So honestly, Google, if they were really smart, would be putting a lot of pressure on a company

470
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:07,260
like Comcast to either make, I think a lot of us would really hate to see things go here,

471
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:12,000
but I think we all know the possibility is it could, to make Stadia bandwidth an exception

472
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
to the cap.

473
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I know.

474
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,160
Well, I hate saying it, but it could happen or pressuring to get those caps raised.

475
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:26,440
So one nice thing about January 20th, um, with the new president coming in is that a

476
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,840
G Pi is buh-bye from, you know, the FCC.

477
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,400
That's true.

478
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,560
So that, that, that brings me all sorts of hope because screw that guy.

479
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,560
Yes.

480
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,560
No, screw that guy.

481
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,560
Don't let the door hit you.

482
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,480
Um, but, uh, yeah, yeah, you're right.

483
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,560
That'll be, that'll be interesting to see what happens with all that.

484
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:49,400
Um, so, uh, let's see, and what else I want to say about Google Stadia and yeah, putting

485
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:54,760
the pressure on like, you know, Comcast to hopefully increase or at least kind of negotiate

486
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:01,440
because you know, Comcast likes to say, Oh, well only 5% of people go over that bandwidth

487
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:08,660
cap, but when you're Google Stadia and your target is that 5% or that, that group that's

488
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:12,360
right at that cap, you know, it's, it's rough.

489
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,160
So I just, yeah, I, I, I do think, and I've, I've said this on the show before too.

490
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:23,280
I do think the thing that will finally light the fire under Comcast, but is going to be

491
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,480
the more wide adoption of 5g and that's coming in the next few years.

492
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,600
But 5g is pretty damn fast, right?

493
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,320
So as 5g becomes available in more and more places, there's going to be people that are

494
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,200
like, you know what, I've got an unlimited plan on my phone.

495
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,800
You know, fuck this Comcast thing.

496
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,480
I'm going to download the games through my tethered phone 5g connection, which I know

497
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:50,040
sounds ridiculous now, but did you think 10 years ago we'd even have what we have here

498
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,520
with these phones?

499
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,000
And that's going to be what it looks like in the future.

500
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,720
But even with 5g though, even if on those unlimited plans, it's not unlimited 5g, it's

501
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:05,220
you get so many gigabytes at 5g and then everything is throttled after that.

502
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,280
That's how they work on most of these cell plans.

503
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,320
It's not going to be the full speed for the full unlimited.

504
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,240
They all have caps.

505
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,320
But like really like if that their argument is that, Oh, only 5% of the customers hit

506
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
that cap.

507
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:28,120
I mean, really there's no different, it doesn't cost them any more money to be able to have

508
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,640
no bandwidth caps at all.

509
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,640
It's just,

510
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:37,540
And they got rid of it for three months in response to the pandemic and just to bring

511
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,900
it back.

512
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:44,560
They're getting rid of it because they're adding it back in is because they're not making,

513
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,520
they're losing sales in their cable subscriptions.

514
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,840
And that's the problem is they need to make that money up somewhere else.

515
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,880
And that's what they're doing.

516
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,960
And on top of that, they're also raising prices across the board anyways, next year and as

517
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,240
they do every year, even though they don't provide me with any other service or whatever,

518
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,620
they just raise the prices each year.

519
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:09,240
But that's what you get when you have basically a monopoly in the company or the country,

520
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,720
each of these capable.

521
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:17,080
And that's why I think 5g is going to finally, I think start to inch its way in on that monopoly

522
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,760
because there will be other ways to get your internet in your house.

523
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:26,760
And 5g, I mean, hypothetically, you could just have a 5g antenna and wire your house

524
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,760
that way.

525
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,200
Like, I know these things I say sound like ridiculous because we don't know them yet.

526
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,200
But why couldn't they?

527
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,020
Why couldn't you have a company that sells 5g internet?

528
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:41,880
They have that in midtown Sacramento, but like, and I keep asking them like when Verizon

529
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,520
comes out there, Oh, yeah, who do you have for your internet and I'm like, I've got you

530
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,520
for my mobile.

531
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:54,520
When are you going to get 5g and part of the team are like, well, I'm like, dude, like,

532
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,400
I would switch if you just brought me the service.

533
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,860
It's just, it's miles down the road.

534
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,240
Can you please just bring it to me?

535
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,240
I mean, I don't know.

536
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,240
All right.

537
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,160
We got off the original topic of the Phil Spencer comments on toxic fandom, but that's

538
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,160
okay.

539
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,160
Tangents we love here on this show.

540
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,720
And it's all about where the gaming industry is currently at.

541
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,260
But to loop it back a little bit, I will just say, you know, I'm happy to see that Phil

542
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,500
Spencer is kind of making these comments and is really kind of pushing the industry

543
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:25,760
to a, together we are stronger type of place than a, you know, fuck that guy and fuck this

544
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,900
guy type of place.

545
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,940
Like we're in our own little, I just think, you know, working together because again,

546
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,340
in the games industry, you've got people that will leave one company for the other and vice,

547
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,420
you know, and all this stuff.

548
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,940
I think it's going to be a healthy thing.

549
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:43,020
And that's why I'm very happy that Phil Spencer is bringing some positivity to gaming.

550
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,020
It's okay.

551
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,040
You can have positivity in the gaming industry.

552
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,640
It's a fine thing.

553
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,160
It's going to work out fine.

554
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,720
So all right.

555
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,000
Some other comments in chat.

556
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,600
Tiger Claw talking about the innovation and stuff saying that Elon Musk has that Starlink

557
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,400
internet service he's been testing out in some places.

558
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,400
So you're right.

559
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,720
There might even be other types of technology that are going to bring internet to your home.

560
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,640
Some things we haven't even thought of yet or are still, you know, in the planning stages.

561
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:15,200
Black Compat in chat says, if Verizon Fios came to my area, it would be over for Comcast.

562
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,200
Yeah.

563
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,480
I keep waiting for that, but that's only on the East Coast.

564
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,480
Yeah.

565
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,600
So it's just a matter of time.

566
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,600
It's just a matter of time.

567
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,600
All right.

568
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,520
Speaking of time and how we spend it, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types

569
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:32,040
of video games we have been playing this week as it was a holiday week.

570
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:36,320
So a good chance to catch up on the backlog over these last few days.

571
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,000
Although Loki may be working on your own thing, but I don't know.

572
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,440
How was your gaming week?

573
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,920
So I didn't play really much of anything.

574
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:48,240
I was trying to play a little bit of Minecraft with my kids, but they had done an update

575
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,380
to...

576
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:58,580
So they did a new update to 1.16 to bring parity between the Java and the Bedrock editions

577
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:02,940
of Minecraft to add some features to kind of make them in alignment.

578
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:07,980
And so they pushed a update and they hadn't pushed an update to the realms.

579
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:15,020
And so it's been really hard too, because they also added realms and server access to

580
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:19,140
the PlayStation version of Bedrock as well.

581
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:24,180
And so it just really tanked being able to connect to realms this week.

582
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:30,020
I was able to get in like a couple of times, but it was just, it was really hard.

583
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,660
They kept timing out and everything.

584
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:35,140
So I'm just waiting for that to kind of cool down a bit.

585
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:39,540
But I did play my realm for like a tiny little bit, just mainly testing the connection because

586
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:43,100
my kids were wanting to play, but I haven't really played anything.

587
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:48,180
I still though, I've been watching Minecraft speedrunners this week.

588
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:52,540
There's a couple of guys I watch, this guy, Danny, who he's developing this game right

589
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,540
now called Carlson.

590
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:57,980
So I watched him, he's a uni developer, but he's been, this entire month, he's been trying

591
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:01,920
to speedrun or become a speedrunner in the Java Minecraft.

592
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,060
And so that's really interesting to me.

593
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:08,300
I kind of want to do the Bedrock stuff, you know, try it because it looks fun.

594
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:14,100
And so it might be something I might try down the road and then a little bit of Orna played

595
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:18,060
that and that's pretty much it.

596
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,340
I didn't really play a lot of games, even those who have been perfect time to do that.

597
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,900
It's all game development.

598
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,900
That's all I've been doing.

599
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,900
It's just solid.

600
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,900
Any free time I have.

601
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,900
Fair enough.

602
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,580
Is that your brother-in-law that just joined the Orna group?

603
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,140
I think that's who that was.

604
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,700
I thought somebody related to you.

605
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:38,500
No, it's that would be, I think that's my sister's coworker.

606
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,500
Oh, okay.

607
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:47,300
My sister and her coworker, I think maybe her boss, they'd asked about it.

608
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,060
God, I'm not that, but yeah.

609
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,060
So they were joining.

610
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,060
Okay.

611
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,060
Yeah.

612
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,060
Neat.

613
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,060
All right.

614
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:57,040
So I had to ask, cause I was like, this person says they know Loki and they've been really

615
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,180
going hard on all the raid bosses and stuff.

616
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,220
Oh yeah.

617
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,220
Finally.

618
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:07,420
Like, so there was a raid boss I had popped like, God, I don't even know if it was like,

619
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:12,560
he wanted to see us in the summer and like, it's just been sitting there near my house

620
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,540
for like a long time and I've been just slowly chipping away.

621
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,460
So I finally chipped away at it and they spawned a new one and I was like, eh.

622
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:24,020
The thing that ticked me off, talking about Orna a little bit, which is, it's a GPS based

623
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,900
game that's very influenced by 8-bit RPGs.

624
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,020
And it's really impressive cause it's all one dude who put it together.

625
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:36,820
I think the music is like, you know, somebody else and some of the art assets are certainly,

626
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:41,940
you know, Loki found the pack with the art assets, but, but for the most part, you know,

627
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,740
it is, it's one individual that's really the kind of the backbone behind it.

628
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,680
So it's, it's pretty well done.

629
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,740
So we play that a lot and yeah, I was kind of the same thing is that I had a raid boss

630
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:55,060
just recently and it was like 7.5 million hit points.

631
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,180
I was like, oh, it's going to take me forever.

632
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,820
Finally just chipped it down and I'm like, okay, yay.

633
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,540
I'm going to summon a new raid boss and maybe this will be one I can get.

634
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,540
Yeah.

635
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,420
The new raid boss I spawned has 15 million hit points.

636
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,420
Really?

637
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,420
Yeah.

638
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,420
I got really, what is it?

639
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:13,060
The, it's the same, the raid boss I have now is also the same raid boss at this month.

640
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,060
So yeah.

641
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,060
The sisters.

642
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,060
Yeah.

643
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,060
Same, same.

644
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,820
And so I like, I don't know, like, cause even like the drops that they have, like I did

645
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,820
go up a level, but like the drops that they have, I can't really, the drops aren't great.

646
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,580
Yeah.

647
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,580
So it's like.

648
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,580
It'd be nice if you could pick the raid boss.

649
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:33,380
So I had these summoning scrolls and I use them somewhere, so, you know, might as well.

650
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,380
All right.

651
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,380
So, okay.

652
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,420
So if that's it for your gaming week, Loki, let me talk about my gaming week.

653
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:42,180
So I've been continuing on my Xbox series X, which Alan has been calling my no man's

654
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,540
sky machine because that's about all he ever sees me playing on it.

655
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:49,580
My save file is now up to 35 hours, just shy of 35 hours.

656
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:53,180
That's an addition to the 25 I spent on PlayStation four pro.

657
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,100
And that's just two of like my seven places.

658
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:58,060
So I've spent a lot of hours on no man's sky.

659
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:01,820
But obviously I've been having a great time and the world's look gorgeous and next gen.

660
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,500
So yeah, I've been enjoying that.

661
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,880
I finally went through, so I name all my galaxies with the alphabet.

662
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:12,180
So I go A, B, C, D, like all the way through the alphabet.

663
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,980
I even found a dessert that began with X.

664
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,060
I think it was called Shushio or something like that, which is a, like a treat in some

665
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,700
Latin American countries or something.

666
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:27,860
I even found one with X and I went all the way to Z and now I'm back at A. So I, in fact,

667
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,540
I'm all the way back through on my second loop.

668
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:34,660
I think I'm up to C. So, yeah, it's funny that I've been to so many galaxies on this

669
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,900
play that I've actually run out of letters.

670
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,100
So there's that.

671
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:41,860
So yeah, I've been doing no man's sky, but then I was finally like, okay, I probably

672
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,400
should be playing something else.

673
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,340
So I started to really spend some time with Ori and the, I always want to say Ori and

674
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,580
the Will of the Wisps.

675
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,820
That's the new one.

676
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:57,660
I went and played the first one, Ori and the Blind Forest, which I've started to play like

677
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:01,020
a couple times and never got very far before I got distracted.

678
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:05,740
But I made it quite a bit further this time in the Ori playthrough that I've been doing.

679
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:09,620
It is the first one because in my brain I'm like, well, I can't play the second one until

680
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,900
I've beaten the first one, right?

681
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,280
Y'all have done something similar, I'm sure.

682
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,900
So yeah, I've been working on the first one, the Ori and the Blind Forest.

683
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:23,140
I will say I've gotten to this part where like I got an ability I wasn't expecting to

684
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,140
get.

685
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,660
Like I was expecting to get like a double jump.

686
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,020
I was like, oh, how do you get up there?

687
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,020
You must need like a double jump.

688
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,420
I was expecting something like that.

689
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:34,420
I was not expecting this ability I just got where you like tie yourselves to lanterns

690
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:39,760
and use them to fling yourself through the air, but you use it with like bullets too.

691
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,060
And you, when you do it, you fling the bullet the other way.

692
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:47,280
And that becomes this whole other mechanic is that you have to basically use opponent's

693
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,680
bullets to destroy the scenery.

694
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,840
I got to say this about Ori.

695
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,300
It's a cutesy game.

696
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,880
It's a game that has a lot of feels.

697
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,560
The beginning of the game is like watching Up, okay?

698
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,580
That's all I'm going to say.

699
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:03,320
If you've seen that movie, you know.

700
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:09,520
But the thing about Ori for as cutesy and feely as it is, it is fucking hard.

701
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,880
Like you die over and over and over again.

702
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,080
And that's how you learn because that's how video games, you know, classic video games

703
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,080
really were.

704
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,680
So Ori, the difficulty can be really unforgiving.

705
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,200
Although I am playing on normal mode.

706
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,480
I think there is a Bobby Blackwolf mode, but I don't see how that would make it any easier.

707
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,160
Like it might make things do less damage and stuff like that, but some of the physics games

708
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,320
you have to play get really difficult.

709
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,720
So yeah, it's really pretty.

710
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:41,280
I haven't actually gotten a chance to play it yet, but I may have to go back and check

711
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,840
it out.

712
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:50,080
So let's see, SHO 100 Matt says, I got Ori and the Blind Forest when I got my Xbox One.

713
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,080
Still haven't played it.

714
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,320
Yeah, that's the thing is it was always kind of like a back burner game for me.

715
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,360
Well, all right, time to bring it up to the front burner.

716
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,920
So I finally really spent some time with it and yeah, I really enjoy it.

717
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,320
The game's on Switch too, which is pretty cool.

718
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,920
And I have some friends who played through it there.

719
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,360
It's also on PC.

720
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,640
So lots of options for you to check out the Ori series.

721
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:14,280
I'm sure the sequel is more pretty and probably harder, so I'm excited to get there at some

722
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,280
point.

723
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:21,040
The other game I've been playing a bit of, surprisingly actually, so I talked about last

724
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,520
week on the show where I kind of, I've put Ingress on pause for a little while, right?

725
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,960
I'm like kind of over it with that.

726
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,280
So I've been spending a little more time with Pokemon Go, especially in amping for the new

727
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,840
levels, which are supposed to hit this week.

728
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:40,320
I actually went downtown and I went downtown and I usually play with Bluetooth, but when

729
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,840
I was downtown, I caught by hand and spun all the stuff.

730
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:48,920
I'm up to 450 Pokeballs in my inventory, so that way when the new levels go live, I can

731
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:54,280
grind with Bluetooth and try to get the 200 Pokemon in a day that you need for level 41.

732
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:59,200
The raids are going to be harder for me than it will be the 200 Pokemon in a day, I think.

733
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,560
So that's something that'll be happening this week, so that'll be interesting.

734
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:07,120
But because of him spending that time in Pokemon Go, I was kind of like, well, I should check

735
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:11,520
out this Pokemon Home thing, because you're supposed to be able to transfer Pokemon to

736
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,060
Pokemon Home.

737
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:17,440
So I ended up kind of picking up Pokemon Shield again and just trying to go through and complete

738
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,920
my decks a little bit, but I've also been playing with some of the Pokemon Home transfer.

739
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,640
So Pokemon Home is like an app that they put out on Switch and the phone, and it's basically

740
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,520
just a storage for your Pokemon.

741
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,640
I don't understand why they couldn't have just modernized Pokemon Bank.

742
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,260
That's a little weird, because Pokemon Bank was the same thing on 3DS, but now they've

743
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,760
made it more mobile.

744
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,160
It's not the same thing?

745
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,120
I thought that they were charging for space or something on this one.

746
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,720
It's the same function, and yes, they are.

747
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,480
So you get a box of 30 Pokemon.

748
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,120
You can hold 30 Pokemon.

749
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,360
I think it'll fit more, but you can't touch them.

750
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:58,240
You can only touch the most recent 30 unless you pay, I think it's like 15 bucks a year.

751
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,760
I haven't signed up to pay yet, but we'll see if I make it.

752
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:07,120
So I transferred some of my shinies, because you know, some of the community days in Pokemon

753
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:11,560
Go, I have like 12 Weedles, 11 Magmars.

754
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,400
I don't need that many shiny Pokemon.

755
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,720
So I put them in Pokemon Bank, and then I transferred a...

756
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,840
I don't think you can move Weedle to Pokemon Shield, because I don't think it's in there,

757
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,200
but Magmar you can.

758
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,180
So I actually moved it over there, and now I have a shiny, another one in Pokemon Shield.

759
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:29,060
So it's been kind of fun like doing that and trying to fill out my decks, and I think the

760
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:34,780
thing that is interesting about Pokemon Home compared to Bank is that Bank was just that.

761
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,780
It was a storage dump for your Pokemon.

762
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,060
That's all it really was.

763
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:43,700
Home has like little achievements in it as well, like you store this many Pokemon, and

764
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:48,100
it has some trading that's built right into it as well, so you can trade direct from Pokemon

765
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,100
Home.

766
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,100
So that's interesting.

767
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:54,980
In fact, I should check, because I put some Pokemon in Wonder Trade earlier.

768
00:42:54,980 --> 00:43:01,860
I put like a Mankey and like a Shellder that I caught, an extra one in Pokemon Shield and

769
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:02,860
something else.

770
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:05,620
One of the Rookidees or something.

771
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:09,140
So I'm actually loading Pokemon Home right now because I want to see, because I put them

772
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:12,300
up in Wonder Trade, so I'm looking, I'm bringing up the app right now.

773
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:15,300
Ooh, I got an exclamation mark in Wonder Box.

774
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,260
Oh, so all of my...

775
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,420
Oh, I wish I could show this better on the camera.

776
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,420
They're back.

777
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,060
I have three new Pokemon.

778
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,500
So let's see what new Pokemon I got from Wonder Box.

779
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,500
So the first one...

780
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,780
It's all trash.

781
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:28,780
It's pro...

782
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:29,940
Well, I sent trash.

783
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,940
So send trash, get trash.

784
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,060
Oh, it's a Yuri Geller.

785
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,060
How about that?

786
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:37,900
Haven't you heard that story this week, right?

787
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,180
It's one of those.

788
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:43,060
It's a Kadabra or a Yuri Geller.

789
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,040
So that's cool.

790
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,700
So I gave away a Drillbur.

791
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,700
That was that.

792
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,700
All right.

793
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,700
The next one.

794
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,300
Isn't this exciting, Radio?

795
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:55,700
To commemorate your Wonder Box trade, I've got a special Pokemon gift for you.

796
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,660
Make sure to get it from the gift box for mystery gifts.

797
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,660
Oh, I didn't know you could get mystery gifts for that.

798
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:05,340
See, that's the other reason to do it is that you get a special Mel Metal the first time

799
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,860
you transfer from Pokemon Go.

800
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:13,820
And then when I did the transfer from Shield into home, I got the Grookey Sobble Score

801
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:18,340
Bunny Starter Set that I guess have the special move or whatever.

802
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:21,260
So there you go.

803
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:26,180
Let's see the next Pokemon I got, because now I'm sure you're all curious, right?

804
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,180
Let's see.

805
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,180
It does this cute little animation.

806
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:31,340
Oh, a Lickitung.

807
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,340
One of my faves.

808
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:35,700
Oh, it's a Japanese Lickitung because it's named.

809
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,740
It's got the Japanese name.

810
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:37,740
Well, that's pretty cool.

811
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,740
Level 16.

812
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:41,260
That poor bastard got a Mankey and trade for that.

813
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:42,260
All right.

814
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:43,260
One more.

815
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,260
One more.

816
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:45,260
It is.

817
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:47,900
Oh, it's Alolan Vulpix, which Vulpixes are cute.

818
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,060
I mean, Alolans are everywhere.

819
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,100
Oh, another Japanese one.

820
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,180
So that's kind of fun.

821
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:56,380
That guy got my level 60 Shellder and trade for that.

822
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:57,380
So that's neat.

823
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:58,380
So there you go.

824
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,380
That's Pokemon Home.

825
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:02,180
You can do some interesting stuff in that.

826
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:05,440
And actdeftinchat says, yeah, there are goals for doing stuff in home.

827
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,340
And if you complete the Pokedex, you get a special Magurna.

828
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,540
I hope I said that right.

829
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,540
So yeah.

830
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:14,100
So you get little like incentives and then there are things you can kind of transfer

831
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,260
back into the game.

832
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,260
So I don't know.

833
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:19,880
I've just been kind of like a little more interested in Pokemon.

834
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,840
What else am I going to do right now?

835
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,800
All this.

836
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,520
Oh, Magurna.

837
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,520
Sorry.

838
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,520
Magurna.

839
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,520
So what else am I going to do right now with everything that's going on in the world?

840
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,440
So yeah, that was my Game of the Week.

841
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,520
Added in some Ori.

842
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,520
Did some Pokemon.

843
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,880
Oh, Final Fantasy XIV as well.

844
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,080
My Black Mage is almost to 80.

845
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,800
And now I'm working on my Dragoon.

846
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,300
I've only got three classes to go and then I will have everything at max level.

847
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,040
So there you go.

848
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,040
That's my Final Fantasy XIV addiction.

849
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,480
All right, let's get into some gaming news.

850
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,600
First off, though, let's do some housekeeping.

851
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,600
This is fun.

852
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:59,160
Because I haven't told you about this, Loki, because I just found out about this about

853
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,160
the way.

854
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,640
Well, I just I just found out about this about 30 minutes forward on the air tonight.

855
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:07,360
But somebody is going to be making a guest appearance on next week's show.

856
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:12,700
Speaking of people that have been teasing games for a little while now, Loki, somebody

857
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:18,500
else who's been teasing games on this program is going to unveil their latest next week

858
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,000
on the program.

859
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,580
And if so, someone else is going to release another game before I do.

860
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:24,580
Yes.

861
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:25,580
Yes, Loki.

862
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:26,580
Yes.

863
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,140
So I can't win.

864
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:34,940
If you go to our pal Y Y R's website at Y Y R Games dot com.

865
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:40,540
He's teasing that next Sunday, December 6th is a Pixel Poops direct.

866
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:42,700
And let me read what it says.

867
00:46:42,700 --> 00:47:01,260
Please join us during next week's Orange Launch Radio next week at 9 Eastern Pacific

868
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:04,720
for something truly moving.

869
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,540
You know, like your pals.

870
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,540
I'm moving.

871
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:08,540
Yes.

872
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:09,820
So check that out next week.

873
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:10,820
Yeah.

874
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,860
He's got a little something, something.

875
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:14,980
And we're going to debut it here on the show.

876
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:18,500
Look, Ubisoft won't let us premiere stuff.

877
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,660
EA won't let us premiere stuff.

878
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,060
Nintendo won't let us premiere stuff.

879
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,020
But you know who will let us premiere stuff?

880
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:26,720
Y Y R. So we're going to we're going to be that meeting.

881
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:37,280
And I'm excited because I'm I'm kind of curious where he's where he's putting that poop.

882
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,780
Is it going to be like a Xbox thing, a PC thing?

883
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,300
A Steam thing?

884
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,480
So where are you putting your poop?

885
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,140
So we're going to find that out next week.

886
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:54,260
Well, maybe it's going on the Wii because it had a lot of shovelware.

887
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:55,260
All right.

888
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:58,060
Bobby Black Wolf in chat is asking, where's the Bobby Black Wolf premiere?

889
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:00,460
I mean, if anywhere can premiere poop, it's Bobby Black Wolf.

890
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,020
You did have the Tommy interview recently.

891
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:06,980
Didn't you get an amico thing from that?

892
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,220
Let us let us have our poopy moment.

893
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,340
All right.

894
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,340
That's next week on the show.

895
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:12,820
I'm excited about that.

896
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:16,900
And Dark Soccer needs to be here, really, because wasn't Pixel Poops kind of like something

897
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:22,060
she just shouted off and and then Y Y R kind of ran with it.

898
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,780
So she really needs to be here.

899
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:25,780
Don't recall what.

900
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:29,180
Yeah, but I think it was something that she said.

901
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:30,180
Yeah.

902
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,100
So we're going to find out on next week's show.

903
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,100
Excited about that.

904
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:34,100
All right.

905
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,100
Let's get to the real poop.

906
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,480
The news of the week.

907
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,700
So, Loki, why don't you start us off tonight with some news?

908
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:40,700
Yes.

909
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:44,020
So Sony would say that this is a real poopy thing that you could do.

910
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:47,860
That is giving away their precious gift.

911
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:55,900
The PS Plus collection that was supposed to be the special gift to PlayStation five owners

912
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:00,260
to have at least a basic library of some PlayStation four games that are going to be compatible

913
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:04,520
with the PlayStation five you can play as an added bonus.

914
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,860
But what did you in grateful people do?

915
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:11,260
You decide to go ahead and sell that to other people.

916
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:19,440
So I guess what they're doing is selling the opportunity to redeem these games, I guess,

917
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:25,820
by logging into their account or logging into it in account somehow to be able to download

918
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:31,980
the games to other systems instead of actually the owner of the PlayStation five.

919
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:37,920
And so what has this what they have done now is because of this, they've started banning

920
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,180
accounts that are selling these.

921
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:42,960
Most of these seem to be out of Hong Kong.

922
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,280
Apparently they're the ones that are doing the most of this.

923
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:53,080
But still, like, how how could you give away, you know, their special gift to you?

924
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:58,040
I mean, granted, because you had it all through PS Plus already granted like, yeah, I do have

925
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,840
most of the stuff in my library already.

926
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:05,300
But like, I mean, where a buck can be made, people are going to try to make it.

927
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:09,900
So I'm not like, is it is it a code that comes in the box or something?

928
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:14,880
I know what what I thought it was you you sign into your account on a PlayStation five

929
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,580
and then it unlocks it right.

930
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:19,460
So people are paying for that permission.

931
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,460
Yeah.

932
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:26,660
So what they're doing is I guess it's they're allowing somebody else to sign into their

933
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:32,080
PlayStation five or they're logging in with that PlayStation five, which will then allow

934
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:40,000
them to download that to or put it in their library, I guess.

935
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,180
I don't know.

936
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:46,720
But apparently what they're doing, though, is they are banning folks with their they're

937
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:57,940
doing like like upwards to like a two month ban or some of them are actually making OK,

938
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:02,400
so the the folks that are actually selling them are getting permanent bans.

939
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,540
The people that are purchasing the PlayStation four accounts are getting two month bans.

940
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:07,700
Well, thanks.

941
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,780
Thanks to this story, making the rounds everywhere.

942
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:13,960
Now I've learned that if I log into someone else's PlayStation five, I should be able

943
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,260
to unlock this for myself.

944
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:16,260
Right.

945
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,960
Let's say we don't trade money, OK?

946
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:24,000
But like I go to a friend's house, let's say or let's say, you know, like Shane is a friend

947
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,520
of mine and has a PlayStation five.

948
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,560
He was on the show a couple of weeks ago talking about it.

949
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,920
What if it's not a money thing?

950
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:33,580
It's just, hey, Rob is visiting and logs into my PlayStation five and now he has access

951
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,580
to it.

952
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:40,440
Like, are we going to get banned because I went on to my friend's PlayStation five?

953
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,480
I don't know.

954
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:46,080
I remember we talked about this a while back with account sharing because folks are doing

955
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:53,820
that before, like they were allowing it was an issue where like you, the person that owned

956
00:51:53,820 --> 00:52:00,140
the game could actually download it to a system and that any user on that system could play

957
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,140
it.

958
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:02,140
Yeah.

959
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,140
And we were having like it was a while back.

960
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:08,540
I think it was like the launch of the PlayStation four where people were sharing accounts.

961
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,620
You do it on the PlayStation three.

962
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:11,620
Alan and I did it.

963
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:15,900
I mean, but we were in a relationship like we shared a lot of things.

964
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,800
So of course we did that, but like there would be things he bought on PlayStation three

965
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:24,120
and so he'd log into my thing, I download them and now I have them or vice versa.

966
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:27,720
You know, but that, I mean, we're not selling it to each other.

967
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,080
Like we're in a relationship.

968
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,720
There's certain things, you know what I mean?

969
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,480
Like it's just, yes, we're going to share some things.

970
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:38,920
So what happened, what the thought is though, is it may have been that these folks aren't

971
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,120
necessarily sharing it with one person.

972
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,780
They're sharing it with a lot of people.

973
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:44,780
So like for example,

974
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,240
And that's, what's getting them flagged probably.

975
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:51,040
Yeah, because they're saying that the thought is it says it's believed that a PlayStation

976
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:55,360
automatically bends consoles where logs in a high number of users, user accounts in a

977
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,260
single day in order to protect it from fraud.

978
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:02,000
So they're thinking, I don't think it's necessarily that they're just having one other person

979
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,420
sign in because that's not necessarily unusual.

980
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:08,120
Like are you going to have to be in a household with two people that own two different PlayStations

981
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,960
and maybe you want to log into each of your own accounts.

982
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,920
And I think that's completely legit, but I think it's when they're having like 30 people

983
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:14,940
log into that.

984
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:15,940
I get it.

985
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:18,700
They're like, hmm, that's a little suspicious.

986
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:22,000
So Bobby in chat says, how do they know you paid money for it and what happens if I log

987
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
back into my PS4?

988
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,420
Well, they think I sold it to myself.

989
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:28,380
So it sounds like the trick may be, I mean, again, Sony doesn't tell us because if they

990
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:32,260
told us how they figured it out, then people would know how to go around it.

991
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:36,300
But it could be that, you know, if you've got one PlayStation five where literally a

992
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:40,720
hundred people have logged into it because the guy keeps flipping it on eBay, that probably

993
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,580
was a red flag for Sony.

994
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:43,580
Yeah.

995
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:51,560
But like if Bobby and his wife log into each other's devices, that shouldn't trigger anything,

996
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,560
you know?

997
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,560
Yeah, it shouldn't.

998
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:59,720
DGRMS says, plus it's probably tracked via IP address, so that's probably a big one as

999
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,720
well.

1000
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:06,300
Like, why are all these American accounts signing into this Hong Kong based PlayStation?

1001
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:10,880
Like maybe one or two, you know, because family can be anywhere, everywhere.

1002
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,880
Right.

1003
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:12,880
But not 50.

1004
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:13,880
Right.

1005
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:17,300
So that those are probably the types of things that are setting off red flags at Sony, I

1006
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,300
imagine.

1007
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,300
But yeah.

1008
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,300
And so I don't know.

1009
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:26,780
It just I mean, it's obviously they're going to catch on if it's that frequent.

1010
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:27,780
Yeah.

1011
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:30,740
But, I don't know, we'll have to see.

1012
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:31,740
Yeah.

1013
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:34,620
And how badly do we need this PlayStation four collection anyway?

1014
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:36,100
Like I'm not knocking it.

1015
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,100
I'm not knocking it.

1016
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,100
It's a nice little deal.

1017
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:42,700
And especially like if you skipped PlayStation four entirely for whatever reason, and now

1018
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,400
you know, you're coming from a PS two or a PS three to a PS five.

1019
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,920
It's a great thing to have because, you know, now it's like, here's everything you missed.

1020
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,280
So it's a huge bonus.

1021
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:58,280
But like outside of that, like especially for like, you know, gamers who have experienced

1022
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,520
PlayStation four and kind of bought the big hit.

1023
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:05,680
Is it that important that you've got to be logging into a PS five in Hong Kong to get

1024
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,680
the library?

1025
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:09,640
Well, I don't think it's necessarily that you're logging into a Hong Kong PS five.

1026
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:13,780
I think it's just a lot of users that were in Hong Kong were doing this.

1027
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:18,740
So it's like necessarily, I think across the board, you know, a lot of people could be

1028
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:22,700
doing it anywhere, but it's just that there was a lot of users that they saw that were

1029
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:23,700
in Hong Kong.

1030
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:24,700
Yeah.

1031
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:30,220
I guess those, I mean, I'm judging you Hong Kong PlayStation users.

1032
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:33,740
Only the ones who sell for money, the Uber capitalist ones.

1033
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:34,740
I get it.

1034
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:38,300
Like it's an expensive console, but like, and you're probably thinking, well, you know,

1035
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:42,760
I don't need these cause I have, you know, all these games already, it'd be different.

1036
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:47,120
Like if it was like a code that was in your PlayStation five box or something like that,

1037
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:52,520
and you're selling that, whereas that might be slightly frowned upon by Sony.

1038
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:57,680
It's not necessarily, I think illegal to do that, but you know, being that this is tied

1039
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:03,860
to your console and when any account logs in, gets these games unlocked, okay.

1040
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:10,240
That wasn't the best way to do it, but you know, it's, I don't know.

1041
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,240
Let me get careful.

1042
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,160
Let me get some other comments from chat on all this.

1043
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:18,480
Fifth dream over at twitch.tv slash vog network says this is worse than animal crossing trades.

1044
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,720
One a shit item, 300 nook mile tickets or we kick out out.

1045
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,640
Yes, is worse than animal crossings now.

1046
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:26,640
Let's see.

1047
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:32,780
Phoenix 77 26 says that's like asking how someone never me, never can share their Disney

1048
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,400
plus account with friends.

1049
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:41,000
I'm laughing because literally on Thursday I was like, Oh dad, you like national geographic,

1050
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
right?

1051
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,280
Oh, you're going to love this.

1052
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,280
Logged them in.

1053
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:50,680
But the thing is like, and these companies like Disney plus and Netflix and so on, they're

1054
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:56,840
pretty transparent now with what they're monitoring because like, I think Disney allows two concurrent

1055
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:57,840
streams, right?

1056
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,200
Am I right?

1057
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,860
It's two concurrent streams on Disney.

1058
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:04,100
It's like two or four on Netflix, depending on your plan.

1059
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:07,320
So it's like, they're telling you, like, if you do more than two, the others are going

1060
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,320
to get knocked off.

1061
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,320
Well, guess what?

1062
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:13,340
Like, nobody's ever going to watch Disney, not on my big screen TV and then my dad maybe

1063
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:14,340
occasionally.

1064
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:17,960
So there's two, but again, I kind of think there's a big difference between you sharing

1065
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:23,240
it with a family member and you're selling it on eBay to make a profit and help pay for

1066
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,240
it.

1067
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,240
You know what I mean?

1068
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,240
Yeah.

1069
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,240
Big difference.

1070
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,240
Big difference.

1071
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,240
So, all right.

1072
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,240
Let's see.

1073
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:33,260
200 Matt says Disney plus allows four concurrent streams.

1074
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:35,140
Well then, I got two more up for grabs.

1075
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,140
Loki, you have Disney plus?

1076
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:37,140
All right.

1077
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:38,140
I do.

1078
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:39,140
Okay.

1079
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:40,140
I don't use it either.

1080
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:41,140
Moving on.

1081
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:42,620
You need to watch the second season of Mandalorian.

1082
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:43,620
I use it once in a while.

1083
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:45,100
I haven't even starred in Mandalorian.

1084
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,940
I need to, but I do watch Sister Act.

1085
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:52,060
I watched the first season, but it's starting to get into spoiler territory with online.

1086
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:54,900
So I'm thinking I have to jump into season two.

1087
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,300
I just haven't really been motivated to.

1088
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,300
It was all right.

1089
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:02,600
It was just not like, it wasn't like the boys where I was like, I got, I got to have season

1090
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,440
two, you know, immediately.

1091
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,400
Whereas Mandalorian is like, yeah, I'll watch it.

1092
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,400
It was good.

1093
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:11,680
But it wasn't like, I'm like, just die hard and got to watch it.

1094
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:16,240
Bobby Blackwell says four concurrent is one of the norms to allow a family with two kids

1095
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,600
to all be streaming at the same time.

1096
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,880
Comcast likes this.

1097
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:20,880
Yeah.

1098
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,800
There you go again with those bandwidth caps and they're, they're all watching things in

1099
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,840
4k on National Geographic.

1100
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,160
Then, you know, goodbye bandwidth.

1101
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:31,220
You know what Comcast would really like?

1102
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:36,460
For you to check out Peacock because Comcast, NBC and all that is in one big thing.

1103
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:40,860
But although I have heard good things about the Saved by the Bell redo or whatever it

1104
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,740
is, continuation series, I don't know.

1105
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:46,300
It's the modern Saved by the Bell and that's all on Peacock.

1106
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:50,540
But I'm kind of surprised and, you know, I maybe with net neutrality coming back, this

1107
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:51,540
wouldn't really be a thing.

1108
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:55,260
I'm kind of surprised Comcast just hasn't said, Hey, if you watch these things on Peacock,

1109
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:58,140
it won't count towards your bandwidth.

1110
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,160
Maybe that's coming.

1111
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,160
I don't know.

1112
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,480
All right, moving on.

1113
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,840
Let's go to another story.

1114
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:09,400
Let's talk about a game that many people are very fond of and still are kind of surprised

1115
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:13,360
maybe because it's been so long that a sequel is incoming for this game.

1116
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:17,720
It is the game The World Ends With You.

1117
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:18,720
That's right.

1118
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,080
The World Ends With You originally came out for the DS.

1119
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,760
It's it's several years old.

1120
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:26,360
In fact, I think it's old enough that dark soccer did it as classic game of the week.

1121
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:29,100
I think relatively recently.

1122
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:32,140
So yeah, it's it's not it's not a redo.

1123
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:35,140
They already did that on the mobile devices and all that.

1124
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:36,640
Not that long ago.

1125
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,460
This is an actual sequel, new characters, new gameplay and so on.

1126
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,500
It is called Neo.

1127
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,220
The world ends with you.

1128
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:48,420
Not to be confused with a character from the Matrix, but you will be going back into the

1129
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:53,300
Reapers game as Rindo and you will team up with some new people and some familiar faces

1130
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:56,020
as well to defeat the Game Master.

1131
00:59:56,020 --> 01:00:00,420
Everything is now in 3D, but still kind of has that similar style to it.

1132
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:06,660
You will have a newly reimagined action combat system and some more answers from the previously

1133
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:07,900
launched story.

1134
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,640
This will be coming in summer 2021.

1135
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:14,760
It is currently scheduled for the PlayStation 4 and the Nintendo Switch.

1136
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:18,720
So no word as of now about Xbox.

1137
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:23,760
Don't know if that's maybe because this announcement kind of came out of Japan where Xbox still

1138
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,760
really isn't a factor.

1139
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:31,220
Square Enix has been doing things with Microsoft because I know I'm personally hyped for the

1140
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:35,340
Dragon Quest XI remaster coming to Game Pass in the next week actually.

1141
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,860
That's probably something I'll talk about next week during my gaming week.

1142
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:41,440
But that's going to be great to experience again in 60 frames a second and all that stuff

1143
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,920
that Xbox Series X will provide.

1144
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:48,860
And then like all the Kingdom Hearts games are on Game Pass too, so we don't know about

1145
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:49,860
Microsoft yet.

1146
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:51,180
Maybe it'll be delayed by a year.

1147
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:53,780
A lot of the stuff has been.

1148
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,760
Right now, no word on that.

1149
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,640
It's just PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.

1150
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,560
But you can, if you want to check out the original game, that final remix of The World

1151
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:06,880
Ends With You, and I think that's the version that they did for the mobile phones and stuff,

1152
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,080
that is also out on the Switch.

1153
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:12,840
So you can check that out if you want.

1154
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:18,240
ActDeftInChat says, there were also new screens of The World Ends With You anime launching

1155
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,240
next year.

1156
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:22,740
So this series is coming back in a big way.

1157
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:25,960
Are you surprised, Loki, that this game is getting a sequel?

1158
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:28,640
I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner.

1159
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:29,640
It's always-

1160
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:36,280
I never played the first one, but I'm not surprised, I guess, because, I don't know,

1161
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,080
nothing surprises me anymore.

1162
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:41,120
Well, you know what game I was surprised got a sequel?

1163
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,120
Was Nier.

1164
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:43,120
You remember that?

1165
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:47,000
And that was on the Xbox 360 here, and we had kind of a different version of that than

1166
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,520
they had in Japan.

1167
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:53,980
And I remember thinking, I don't think this game did well enough to necessitate a sequel,

1168
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:59,380
and then the sequel comes out years later, is a big surprise, and one of the greatest

1169
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:04,880
video games of the year, and some would argue the decade, or even ever, gets released.

1170
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,380
So sometimes these sequels-

1171
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:07,380
Still haven't played it yet.

1172
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:08,380
Oh, you should.

1173
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:09,380
It's good.

1174
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:10,380
I know.

1175
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:15,980
I remember the original Nier, but other than the name, they didn't really resemble each

1176
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:16,980
other.

1177
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:21,740
Just throw the original Nier on 360 out of your mind.

1178
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:24,760
This is a new thing, and you didn't need to play the original to understand it, and you'll

1179
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:25,760
be fine.

1180
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:26,760
I understand that.

1181
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:31,240
I get that, but it just never- I don't know.

1182
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:37,600
I'm not familiar with the universe of the original Nier to know whether or not this

1183
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:44,640
was basically in the same universe, or if it's tied together other than in name only.

1184
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:51,260
AkumaJP in chat says Nier has hardcore fandom, but that's also kind of a Japan versus US

1185
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:52,260
thing.

1186
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:56,260
Of course, that game has fandom now, but I'm talking like pre-Nier Automata.

1187
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:59,700
We only had that 360 version, which I think was a completely separate game you guys had

1188
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:01,020
in Japan.

1189
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:06,680
That one they're redoing is brand new for us in America, which it's weird how it all

1190
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:14,340
works out, but yeah, I didn't think that fandom before Automata, again, was here in the

1191
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:16,140
States, but it's certainly there now.

1192
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:19,880
People loved Nier Automata, and I understand- I've played enough of it to understand why

1193
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:22,220
people love that game so damn much.

1194
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:25,160
So great music, my god.

1195
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:27,600
So yeah.

1196
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:31,300
And AkDef says if you want to go full canon, Nier is part of the Drakengard universe.

1197
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:32,300
That's true.

1198
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:35,760
I remember hearing that, so yeah, neat.

1199
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,400
All right, let's move on.

1200
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:40,800
So that's cool that World Ends With You is getting a sequel after all this time as well,

1201
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:44,780
because it has had its fans that were pretty hardcore over the years, so they're getting

1202
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:48,940
rewarded in a big way, not just with a new game, but with the anime.

1203
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:52,040
Who's not being rewarded, Loki?

1204
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:59,660
If you bought a Wii U and you own Super Mario Maker, well, you're not going to be able to-

1205
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:06,600
they're removing the course share function starting, of course, on that ever so popular

1206
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:11,600
date with Nintendo removing things, March 31st, 2021.

1207
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,860
The end of the fiscal year.

1208
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:16,580
The day that they just say, you know what, Mario?

1209
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:18,440
You had your 35th anniversary.

1210
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:21,700
Now we're just kicking you in the pants during in the trash.

1211
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:24,120
Oh, mama mia.

1212
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,660
They're just removing everything at that time.

1213
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:34,540
So apparently if you have Super Mario Maker for Wii U, the game will be removed from sale

1214
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:39,140
on Nintendo eShop as well on January 13th, 2021.

1215
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:42,400
Mario will be deleted on March 31st.

1216
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,960
And then also apparently, though, they just reminding you it's not going to have any impact

1217
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,440
on the second game.

1218
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:55,320
Also Super Mario Maker Bookmark is the service on that website is also ending as well.

1219
01:04:55,320 --> 01:05:00,760
They say it won't be possible to look up any bookmark courses on the Wii U version of the

1220
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,840
course world.

1221
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:08,460
But you can still play, I guess, courses that were- it says it will still be possible to

1222
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:12,640
play courses that were uploaded before the course upload feature was discontinued and

1223
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,700
to redownload the game after its removal from the eShop.

1224
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:16,700
Oh, thank you.

1225
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:20,660
Well, that's nice that I can redownload the game that I purchased.

1226
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:27,540
For now, until they close the Wii U eShop permanently, which I would be really surprised if that's

1227
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:32,600
not in the next two years, I'm going to say, is that the Wii U shop goes kaput, just like

1228
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,020
the Wii shop did.

1229
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:35,700
So it's a matter of time.

1230
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:38,480
And that's that's some of the problem with these online games.

1231
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:43,560
I mean, it's nice that at least you can go online and still get the levels.

1232
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:46,600
You're just not going to be able to add to the very large repository of levels.

1233
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:50,560
And the only bummer about this, and I do understand, and Dart to see you in chat says, well, to

1234
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,760
be fair, they did put out a sequel.

1235
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:55,800
So they're probably assuming more people are playing on that now.

1236
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:56,800
Correct.

1237
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:58,700
More people own a Switch than on the Wii U.

1238
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:04,800
But let's not forget, there were some things, not many, but there were some things that

1239
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:09,640
Mario Maker first one could do that the sequel can't do.

1240
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:16,420
For example, one of my levels that I did only can exist in the first game because I used

1241
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:18,460
the amiibo characters.

1242
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:21,060
And that's not that's probably the biggest thing that's not in the sequel.

1243
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,840
And I wish it was.

1244
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:23,840
I miss it.

1245
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:27,540
Like that was that was a fun little thing in the 8-bit mode, and I don't understand

1246
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:29,580
why they didn't bring that over.

1247
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:33,260
Maybe it was a licensing thing with some of the extra characters, then fine, take the

1248
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:35,020
non amiibo characters out or whatever.

1249
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:39,460
But I'm just surprised that never made its way to Mario Maker 2.

1250
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:44,100
Because otherwise, why can't they just be like, we're going to take all your original

1251
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,860
levels and put them in the Mario 2 database?

1252
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:48,540
But they can't really do that.

1253
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:51,460
Yeah, it's just probably different.

1254
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:55,360
And then also, there's still the 3DS version, which I think is that stuff as well.

1255
01:06:55,360 --> 01:07:00,000
And oh, yeah, I forgot about the 3DS version.

1256
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Whoops.

1257
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:07,920
Yeah, so oh, well, yeah, um, fifth dream points out baby metal was a thing and Mario made

1258
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:08,920
this right.

1259
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:11,440
And dark Tetsuya talking about the licensing says, oh, that's true.

1260
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,720
It might have been licensing.

1261
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:17,600
Like I love the Hello Kitty skin lol Yeah, some of that stuff would probably be hard

1262
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,500
to get in Mario Maker 2.

1263
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:23,560
But there was also a ton of stuff that was Nintendo's own stuff.

1264
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:27,340
You know, most of those amiibos are all Nintendo's own things.

1265
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:30,340
So they shouldn't have had such a hard time bringing that over.

1266
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:32,460
They just didn't do it for whatever reason.

1267
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:35,500
Act F does point out we got the link thing in Mario Maker 2.

1268
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:38,540
And that was really cool because that brought new mechanics with it as well.

1269
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:42,260
And maybe that was the level Nintendo wanted new characters to be at.

1270
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:47,420
But I don't know, they've kind of they've ended major support for Mario Maker 2 already,

1271
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:48,420
right?

1272
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:49,420
Like, yes, you can still upload.

1273
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:52,760
It's not the same that you still upload levels and the community is still there and everything.

1274
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:56,840
But they're, they're not planning to, like they said, the last major patch was the last

1275
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:59,480
major patch, right?

1276
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:00,480
Pretty sure.

1277
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:01,480
Yeah.

1278
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:02,480
I don't know.

1279
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,080
It is kind of disappointing that they didn't do more with this.

1280
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,560
I was hoping they'd have more in there.

1281
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:09,280
But maybe they're saving it for Mario Maker 3 or something.

1282
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,280
Maybe.

1283
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,280
I don't know.

1284
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,280
Yeah.

1285
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:17,940
Anyway, so those of you that are still gaming on your Wii U, TikTok, because I don't know

1286
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:23,060
what's left on Wii U that's not on the Switch or going to be on the Switch.

1287
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:25,100
Everything has to be at the end of this fiscal year.

1288
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:30,500
Like it's so weird that so many things are being discontinued on the 31st.

1289
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:31,740
Like I don't know.

1290
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:34,780
Is it some type of server cost they can write out for the next year?

1291
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:37,540
I would think it would be miniscule, but I don't know.

1292
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:38,540
It's weird, though.

1293
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:40,260
It's just, it seems odd.

1294
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:41,740
I guess we'll have to wait and see.

1295
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,200
Oh, thank you.

1296
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,200
Dr. Seo points out a really good one.

1297
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,680
Xenoblade X. Real soon, I hope.

1298
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:53,140
I hope that's one of the ones that they poured over to the Switch, but we'll see.

1299
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:58,240
Maybe they're waiting for that Switch Pro, and then they're going to do a souped up Xenoblade

1300
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:02,000
X, kind of like they did the other Xenoblade.

1301
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I don't know.

1302
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,760
Just a crazy thought.

1303
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:08,320
So Sia Tabiri suggests Earthbound and Earthbound Zero from the Virtual Console.

1304
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:13,260
Yeah, it would be nice to get those games in Nintendo's new Switch system, wouldn't

1305
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:14,260
it?

1306
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:15,260
Hmm.

1307
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:16,260
All right.

1308
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:21,860
Anyhow, let's move on and talk about, so we've got old consoles no longer being supported.

1309
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:26,260
How about old consoles still being supported by Natsume?

1310
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:31,780
Because they are doing some rereleases, get this, on the NES and the Game Boy Color.

1311
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:37,280
And when I talk about rereleases, I'm not talking about like these games now available

1312
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:45,000
on the Switch, I'm talking about get an actual NES cartridge for Shadow of the Ninja.

1313
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
So you can check that out.

1314
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
It's a partnership.

1315
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Oh, that's cool.

1316
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,660
Yeah, it's a partnership with Limited Run Games to actually rerelease some of their

1317
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:51,660
games.

1318
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:56,300
So Shadow of the Ninja, originally from the year 1990, and Return of the Ninja for the

1319
01:09:56,300 --> 01:10:00,180
Game Boy Color from 2001 are going to be released by Limited Run Games.

1320
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:02,420
They will work on the original hardware.

1321
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:06,140
So this is an actual cartridge in both cases that will work.

1322
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:10,680
The pre-orders already went up, so they're probably already gone, sorry.

1323
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:12,400
But that is something that happened.

1324
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,560
So who knows, maybe there'll be more in the future.

1325
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:18,120
But I just thought that was really neat that, you know, and this isn't the first, wasn't

1326
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:21,160
there like a Mega Man game recently or something too that?

1327
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:22,600
It wasn't too recent.

1328
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:29,480
It was a while ago they did Mega Man 9, I want to say they did a physical release of

1329
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:30,480
that.

1330
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,480
Yeah.

1331
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:36,780
I don't remember if they did 10 as well, but I know 9 I think was done, because they released

1332
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:41,380
that in like the eShop, or not eShop, well actually it might have been the eShop actually.

1333
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:47,700
All the online services, and then they also did a limited edition cart that you could

1334
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:48,700
buy as well.

1335
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:54,140
And then of that there was even an even more limited edition cart that was like blue or

1336
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:55,140
something.

1337
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:56,140
Yeah, yeah, I remember that.

1338
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:58,180
Dart 2 Studio says, I thought this was cool.

1339
01:10:58,180 --> 01:10:59,860
I played a bit of that on Switch Online.

1340
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:01,160
It was kind of fun.

1341
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:02,160
Super tough though.

1342
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:06,160
And yeah, that's one thing that should be called out is that this game is actually on.

1343
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:10,100
It was very recently added to the Switch Online service.

1344
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:18,020
So if you have the classic Nintendo Entertainment System collection as a Nintendo Online subscriber,

1345
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:20,920
if you go in there, you can actually play this game.

1346
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:24,580
So it is, it's really something that like in addition to that, they're still putting

1347
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:25,580
it out on cartridge.

1348
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:29,500
Now, I imagine they're not making a lot of them, and the pre-orders I'm sure sold out

1349
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,540
within less than a day.

1350
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:35,380
But it's neat that that market is still there for these things to be playable on the original

1351
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:36,380
hardware.

1352
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:41,560
Oh, and YYR actually points out that the games are actually still available, so they didn't

1353
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:44,760
instantly sell out, because usually these things do.

1354
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:48,640
Maybe the titles are a little too obscure for some people, I don't know, but that is

1355
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:49,920
something you can get on if you want.

1356
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:53,220
Or maybe they're going to print as many as get ordered, I don't know.

1357
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:55,220
So it's kind of neat.

1358
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:57,720
All right, let's move on.

1359
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:58,720
Loki.

1360
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:04,580
All right, so Fall Guys season three is obviously right around the corner.

1361
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:08,860
And so the tease, what the reveal of what the season was going to be, they decided to

1362
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:10,260
do something kind of fun.

1363
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:17,820
They decided to split up the teaser image into a 300 piece jigsaw puzzle, and offered

1364
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:24,140
it to folks on Twitter and Discord, and had them work together to try to put together

1365
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:27,960
the puzzle, which they did within a few hours.

1366
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:35,060
And so now it's going to be, it looks like a winter-themed Fall Guys, which I guess is

1367
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:36,060
appropriate.

1368
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,140
But yeah, it's pretty cool.

1369
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:44,740
So they've got snowmen and penguins, so yeah, so that'll be coming pretty soon.

1370
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:45,740
Neat.

1371
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:50,380
Akdeftnchat says, I got to level 40 on season two last week, and I'm looking forward to

1372
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:51,380
season three.

1373
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:54,980
Yeah, Winter Knockout is what it's called, I guess.

1374
01:12:54,980 --> 01:13:02,240
So they don't have a date when it's supposed to launch yet, but you know, the Game Awards

1375
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:07,140
right around the corner, so I guess they get a release date for that, so we'll see.

1376
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:10,600
By the way, since it didn't make tonight's show roll and you brought up the Game Awards,

1377
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:16,260
have you heard the most recent fan wank about the Game Awards and what's set to be announced?

1378
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:17,720
I don't know if I believe it.

1379
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:21,920
This rumor's been coming up too many times where it's almost becoming self-parody.

1380
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:28,100
If it happens, great, but it is the Hideo Kojima Silent Hills on PlayStation thing,

1381
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:31,660
and you know that's been going around for a while, and now they're saying, this is it,

1382
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:32,660
it's happening.

1383
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:33,660
Game Awards.

1384
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:39,160
If it does, if it doesn't, I'm not going to be disappointed.

1385
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:46,020
What would be really cool though, again, this is total tinfoil hat, fan wank city, this

1386
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:51,160
isn't going to happen, but I'm going to say it anyway, if on the day of the game rewards

1387
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:57,540
they release the PT again for PlayStation 5, because Silent Hills is happening, and

1388
01:13:57,540 --> 01:14:02,620
that's why Konami was holding it back.

1389
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:04,620
Just saying, just saying.

1390
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:07,780
It would be amazing, but it's not going to happen.

1391
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:15,340
I've learned to live with a lot of disappointment in the year 2020, so I'm not going to have

1392
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:16,500
my hopes.

1393
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,400
So there's one more for you.

1394
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:19,400
Yeah.

1395
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:20,400
Yeah.

1396
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:23,220
We'd like to think that there's going to be a Grand Theft Auto 6 announcement at some

1397
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:24,220
point.

1398
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:25,220
Sure.

1399
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:26,220
Nah.

1400
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:27,220
I, you know.

1401
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:31,700
When, the game awards are what, December 10th, is that Thursday night that that's happening?

1402
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:35,020
Bobby, are we doing a game awards thingy again?

1403
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:39,380
Because it's, I can't believe it's been a year since the last one, my God, time flies.

1404
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:41,660
This year has been crazy.

1405
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:48,180
But I do remember we did a, like a thing where we watched the game awards and we live reacted

1406
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:53,040
and everything, because I feel like we need to do one so that if that does happen, we

1407
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:55,240
need a live react.

1408
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,240
So all right.

1409
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:58,680
Bobby says we can, so please look forward to it.

1410
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:01,720
We'll do a live react thing on the 10th for the game awards.

1411
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:02,720
That'll be fun.

1412
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,280
All right.

1413
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:05,820
Let's move on.

1414
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:10,760
Let's talk about something that will be happening, and it's a retro thing all over.

1415
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:14,360
It's another micro console because these collectibles, they're everywhere.

1416
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,480
Capcom is doing their own.

1417
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:20,780
It's a new one that they're doing, and it's going to be available for the holiday season

1418
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:21,780
in Japan.

1419
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:24,280
I don't know when it's coming here.

1420
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:28,900
It's actually coming, excuse me, to Japan this week on December the 1st.

1421
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:31,080
So maybe some folks will want to import that.

1422
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:36,940
It is a tiny little Capcom arcade player, and it actually has Mega Man, the power battle

1423
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:39,340
and Mega Man 2, the power fighters.

1424
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:43,920
So those Mega Man fighting games that, you know, you don't, I'm sure those of you with

1425
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,840
Mame probably checked it out at some point in your life, but you know, I don't think

1426
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:52,100
a lot of people here necessarily played those games a lot, so it'll be neat that those are

1427
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:53,100
out.

1428
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:54,720
Well, I think they had it in those Mega Man collections.

1429
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:55,720
They had the power battles.

1430
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:56,960
Oh, they did.

1431
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,260
They did, and one of them they did.

1432
01:15:58,260 --> 01:15:59,260
Maybe even soccer.

1433
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:04,860
I remember, I never played Mega Man soccer, but I can tell you that many times at Blockbuster

1434
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:09,260
I looked at the back of that and going, did I rent this?

1435
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:11,520
And then I never did.

1436
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:16,260
Also coming out Street Fighter 2, Super Street Fighter 2, Super Puzzle Fighter 2.

1437
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:21,820
So it's an interesting kind of like Street Fighter slash Mega Man hybrid thing, but okay.

1438
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:23,740
I mean, that seems pretty cool.

1439
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:26,980
It's cute because it has like the whole six button design, even though it's like super

1440
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:28,220
tiny.

1441
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:35,400
It's going to be about $210, or if you want in yen, it's 21,780 yen.

1442
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:40,180
So it's like a cross between a CRT TV and Mega Man's helmet.

1443
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:45,040
Yeah, it's the folks that did the Neo Geo Mini are actually making this, and I actually

1444
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:48,000
have a Neo Geo Mini, and it's cute.

1445
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:53,260
So this is pretty expensive, but I'll be curious, I want to check it out.

1446
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:57,920
So no word yet if it'll release here, but I'm sure that won't stop some folks from importing

1447
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,760
it, that's for sure.

1448
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:04,960
All right, let's get to the classic game of the week, shall we?

1449
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:07,360
Since we're on classic games anyway.

1450
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:11,300
Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, we invite Dark Soccer to step into the gaming

1451
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:16,740
vault, and find a game that she thinks, hey, you brats should check out this game this

1452
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:17,740
week.

1453
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:22,420
It's a classic game, and you got to respect the classics, because that's how we got here.

1454
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:24,100
And of course, Dark Soccer's not here tonight.

1455
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:28,240
I mentioned earlier she has the night off, and I was going to try to invite somebody

1456
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:33,820
on, but I didn't have a ton of notice, so I wasn't able to get anybody to fill in.

1457
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:38,000
So I'm going to fill in with the classic game of the week, and do something.

1458
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,320
I think I'd put this on the back burner a long time ago, but I went through the wiki,

1459
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:47,000
and I never picked this one, and this one is kind of like an interesting sort of game.

1460
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:53,400
It's an entry in a long running series that I think most people have really forgot about.

1461
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:59,520
And so the game that I've picked for the classic game of the week is Donkey Kong 3.

1462
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:00,520
That's right.

1463
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:03,940
Not the original, but Donkey Kong 3.

1464
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:12,220
This is the one that takes place in a gardening type of setup, or a greenhouse, if you will.

1465
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:18,380
Whereas in the first Donkey Kong game, you played as Mario, and you were kind of going

1466
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:21,700
against Donkey Kong, because Donkey Kong kidnapped Pauline.

1467
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:24,060
In the second game, the tables were turned, right?

1468
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:29,580
In Donkey Kong Jr., Mario was the bad guy, and you were Donkey Kong Jr. trying to save

1469
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:30,580
Donkey Kong.

1470
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:35,840
Well, now in this third game, you take on the role of Stanley.

1471
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,140
Who the fuck is Stanley?

1472
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:41,240
I don't know, because this is the only game Stanley ever appeared in, and Stanley's also

1473
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:46,640
one of those characters that rarely gets acknowledged by Nintendo after the fact.

1474
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:52,960
And I don't know if it's the reason because this game didn't catch on, at least in America,

1475
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,480
as well as the other Donkey Kong games did, or what.

1476
01:18:55,700 --> 01:19:01,420
But yeah, this game was released October of 1983 in Japan, and it followed shortly after

1477
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:04,260
in North America and Europe.

1478
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:08,540
And it's kind of blamed that it was not the commercial failure in North America, or excuse

1479
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:12,980
me, that it was a commercial failure in North America, because it came out right around

1480
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:16,580
the same time that the video game crash was happening.

1481
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:23,860
I'm actually not sure I really believe that, because I don't think in retrospect the arcade

1482
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:31,920
industry ever crashed as hard as the console industry did in 1983.

1483
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:35,120
You know, arcades kind of made it through.

1484
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:39,120
And granted, there might be other things that you kind of contribute to that.

1485
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:44,880
However, I think the unique nature of Donkey Kong 3 and why it's a little weird could be

1486
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,760
a symptom of the video game crash in 83.

1487
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:53,000
And what I mean by that is, this really isn't like the other two Donkey Kong games.

1488
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,700
Now I'm highlighting it as a classic game of the week.

1489
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:58,580
I think it is an interesting game, but it is interesting in the ways that it is very

1490
01:19:58,580 --> 01:20:01,180
much not like the other Donkey Kong games.

1491
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:04,980
Donkey Kong, the original, and Donkey Kong Jr. were kind of platformers, right?

1492
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:13,060
And a lot of the spiritual successors like Super Mario Brothers and Donkey Kong Country

1493
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:14,980
also platformers.

1494
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:17,700
Donkey Kong 3 looks like a platformer.

1495
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:18,700
It's not.

1496
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:21,800
As you're watching this on Twitch, can't you see?

1497
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,680
This is a shooter.

1498
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:27,780
And what you're doing is you're shooting the bugs and you're using the spray to shoot Donkey

1499
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:29,280
Kong up and off the screen.

1500
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:34,960
Now back to my point about why I think maybe Donkey Kong 3 in itself is a symptom of the

1501
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:42,280
video game crash is that I, and nowhere in the official wiki or any official resource

1502
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:46,400
that I've read does it ever say that this is the case.

1503
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:49,340
This is my own speculation, okay?

1504
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:54,040
I think that Donkey Kong 3 probably started off as a completely different game, a completely

1505
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:56,740
different type of property or idea.

1506
01:20:56,740 --> 01:21:00,740
And then somewhere along the way, someone said, hey, why don't we put Donkey Kong's

1507
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:03,440
face on it and it'll sell plenty more.

1508
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:06,440
It'll do much better if we just slap Donkey Kong into it.

1509
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:09,300
Why do you have this character climbing up the vines that's the bad guy?

1510
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:10,300
We can have Donkey Kong.

1511
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:11,300
There you go.

1512
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:12,300
This is Donkey Kong 3.

1513
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:13,300
Do it.

1514
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:14,300
Print it.

1515
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:20,040
Print is very much, I think a symptom of what led the industry to crash in 83 was, uh, let's

1516
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:24,080
just release a video game cause we can.

1517
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,080
So I don't know.

1518
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:28,840
And again, I have nothing to go off of or anything that indicates that is true.

1519
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:32,000
When you hear about the development of the game, you know, we know that the director

1520
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,960
was actually Miyamoto was the director behind this game and that the legendary Gunpei Yokoi

1521
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:39,620
was the producer behind this game.

1522
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:42,040
And the music was by Hirokazu Tanaka.

1523
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:47,700
I mean, this was an all star Nintendo team that put this together, but I've known Nintendo

1524
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:53,020
to start something as one thing and then say, huh, maybe this should be something else.

1525
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:54,300
So I don't know.

1526
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:58,520
That's just, you know, again, my guess I'm taking a quick look over at our chat over

1527
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,860
at twitch.tv slash vog network.

1528
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:01,860
Yeah.

1529
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:05,900
Dark Tetsuya says, um, yeah, that seems like it would have happened that way.

1530
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:10,860
Uh, YYR says the later levels of DK3 feel real shmup like in the way that you need to

1531
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:12,120
dodge, weave and attack.

1532
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,120
Yeah.

1533
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:16,240
Especially, and you're probably noticing as you watch on Twitch, the first couple levels

1534
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:19,460
are pretty straightforward, but then it's when you get to that level where the middle

1535
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:23,220
platform is kind of like half missing and you can't just jump up and shoot them off

1536
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:25,240
the screen as fast as possible.

1537
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:29,640
Um, you really, yeah, it becomes very much like a dodge and weave type of thing.

1538
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:32,640
Uh, Questbuster says it's like Galaga with platforms.

1539
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:33,640
Heck yeah.

1540
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:38,180
And wouldn't this be a very Nintendo kind of way to respond to a game like Galaga and

1541
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:40,840
how successful it was again?

1542
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:45,140
And a Phoenix 77, 26 says, that's just a theory, a Rob theory.

1543
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:46,140
Sure.

1544
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:48,540
I see what you did there, but call it what you want.

1545
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:49,940
But I think there's something to it.

1546
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:53,780
I think this may have started as like Nintendo's kind of answer to that.

1547
01:22:53,780 --> 01:23:00,460
Uh, how, how cute would it be if it was bugs instead of spaceships?

1548
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:02,700
And that's our answer to Galaga.

1549
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:05,120
You know, it would be very similar, like Splatoon.

1550
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:09,500
What if we made a first person shooter, but it was paint instead of guns.

1551
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:10,500
Hmm.

1552
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,920
Um, let's see.

1553
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:17,440
Uh, and then, uh, as Joe and Hunter Matt points out, turns out Stanley is a trophy in Melee

1554
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:18,840
and a spirit in Ultimate.

1555
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:22,840
So, I mean, yeah, it hasn't been forgotten, but it does exist in this really weird place

1556
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:23,840
in Nintendo's history.

1557
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:30,880
And a lot of people, you know, you have to say Donkey Kong 3 before people go, oh yeah,

1558
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,400
that was the weird one.

1559
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:37,160
So, now I remember, so since, you know, sometimes we have personal connections to these classic

1560
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:42,340
games of the week, I remember this because the grocery store of all places, talk about

1561
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:45,620
things that led to the crash and, you know, video games were everywhere.

1562
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:49,440
The grocery store had a copy of Donkey Kong 3.

1563
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:53,860
And I remember sinking quarters into the game because it is, it is a really good cabinet.

1564
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:56,500
And I love the old Nintendo arcade hardware.

1565
01:23:56,500 --> 01:24:01,140
Those joysticks and those buttons really have a way of snapping and clicking in a way that

1566
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:02,620
not all the old machines do.

1567
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:07,100
So Donkey Kong 3 was really fun to play on those old machines.

1568
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:11,960
If you want to play Donkey Kong 3, there are other ways that you can check this game out.

1569
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:13,960
I believe it went onto Virtual Console.

1570
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:19,960
Yeah, it was on the Wii Virtual Console, 3DS Virtual Console, and Wii U Virtual Console.

1571
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:24,140
Those are all available on the Wii, you know, those various systems.

1572
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:31,080
It is not part of the Switch Online library, but it is one of the releases that Hamsters

1573
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:32,760
Arcade Archives did.

1574
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:37,080
So you know how there's like a limited selection of Nintendo games in the Arcade Archives versus

1575
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:41,180
Super Mario Brothers being the most notable and the one that sold the most on the Switch

1576
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:43,060
and still is in the best seller list.

1577
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:45,340
Donkey Kong 3 is actually there as well.

1578
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:48,380
So if you're willing to pay, you know, seven, eight bucks, whatever they're charging for

1579
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:51,380
those games, you can check out Donkey Kong 3.

1580
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:56,020
You know, and it's worth a look if you've never played it, but you know, it is a classic

1581
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:57,340
80s arcade game.

1582
01:24:57,340 --> 01:24:59,180
It was a very simple loop.

1583
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:03,540
So make sure you're going in with the appropriate expectations.

1584
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:06,300
There is some other interesting legacy to this game.

1585
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:11,440
Since the game did do better in Japan, there was actually kind of a sequel-ish type of

1586
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:17,400
thing developed by Hudson Soft called Donkey Kong 3 The Great Counterattack.

1587
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:24,240
It was available on the NEC PC-8801, 6601, Sharp X1, and FM7.

1588
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:27,620
In other words, none, nothing that you could get here in the States.

1589
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:30,640
So these were all Japanese only things.

1590
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:37,340
And honestly, I've seen videos of this game, and I'm going to be honest with you, it doesn't

1591
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:38,340
hold up well.

1592
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:39,880
It doesn't look good at all.

1593
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:46,340
Those systems used kind of like a CGA style graphics, meaning the only colors were...

1594
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:48,020
It's not the cyan, magenta.

1595
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:49,020
It's the other one.

1596
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:53,660
I think it's yellow, red, black, green.

1597
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:56,140
I think we're the only colors on those.

1598
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:57,140
That's right.

1599
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:01,200
You see it on the gameplay, and it doesn't look good.

1600
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:04,680
You still are trying to shoot Donkey Kong up the screen, but it's like you have these

1601
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:06,640
weird backgrounds.

1602
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:11,120
It kind of looks like Bomberman with these weird ass backgrounds that have nothing to

1603
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:14,960
do with the game, and there's no platforms anymore.

1604
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,200
And so it's weird.

1605
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:21,140
I don't particularly like it, but you can check it out and decide for yourself.

1606
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:23,920
It is an interesting part of gaming's history, I will say that.

1607
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,800
There was also a Game & Watch that was available for it.

1608
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:32,380
I'm not sure to what extent you really saw these out here in the U.S., but it was included

1609
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:38,480
in the Game & Watch Gallery 4 for the Game Boy Advance, but get this, they replaced Stanley

1610
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:41,140
with Mario in that version.

1611
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:43,180
Isn't that interesting?

1612
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:45,940
This Stanley erasure, I hate it.

1613
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:48,760
And then instead of the bees, you got fireballs.

1614
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:53,420
So they really tried to Mario-fy the Game & Watch version, which is really interesting.

1615
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:55,900
So anyway, pour one out for Stanley.

1616
01:26:55,900 --> 01:27:01,180
I think the long-lost Nintendo icon, although I guess there is some shout-outs in the Smash

1617
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:05,640
games where you would expect to see them, but it is interesting, Stanley never did come

1618
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:06,640
back.

1619
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:07,640
He was never heard from again.

1620
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:10,600
So there you go.

1621
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:13,100
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, I did get Donkey Kong 1.

1622
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:14,100
It's definitely worth it.

1623
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:16,760
It has online leaderboards if you want to try for a high score.

1624
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:19,000
Talking about the arcade archives.

1625
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,060
Dark Tetsuya also says, I played a little bit of the PC port.

1626
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:24,060
It was interesting.

1627
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:26,840
That's a nice word to use, Dark Tetsuya.

1628
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:29,740
And some folks in chat are making the joke about the Stanley parable.

1629
01:27:29,740 --> 01:27:33,200
Yes, I see what you guys are doing there.

1630
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:36,740
And YYR says, they just Mario-fied the ball game in the new Game & Watch.

1631
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:37,740
Yep, yep.

1632
01:27:37,740 --> 01:27:40,220
Put Mario in everything, that's for sure.

1633
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:41,220
Let's see.

1634
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:46,460
And SSJ100Matt with an interesting fact saying, apparently the same guy who holds the world

1635
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:50,220
record for Donkey Kong holds the world record for Donkey Kong 3.

1636
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:51,220
Robbie Lakeman.

1637
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:52,220
Well, how about that?

1638
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:53,220
Congratulations.

1639
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:58,620
And that's actually especially interesting because they're not similar games, you guys.

1640
01:27:58,620 --> 01:28:00,740
Donkey Kong 3, I almost said Dark Tetsuya 3.

1641
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:02,380
I just made you a video game.

1642
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:06,400
Donkey Kong 3, again, is a shooter.

1643
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,980
It's not really like a platformer.

1644
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:10,580
So it's very interesting that the same guy holds both records.

1645
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:16,900
But go back to some of those 80s icon, you know, people that were in magazines and stuff

1646
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:18,420
for having all the awards.

1647
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:21,660
You know, love them or hate them or don't give a shit about them.

1648
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:25,460
Billy Mitchell had a lot more awards than just Donkey Kong.

1649
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:27,980
He had the high score in probably some games you never heard of, too.

1650
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:31,940
So sometimes those games kind of cross over.

1651
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:35,700
Anyway, before I wrap this segment, Loki, did you ever play Donkey Kong 3 by chance?

1652
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:36,700
I'm just curious.

1653
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:37,700
I have not.

1654
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:38,700
Really?

1655
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:39,700
Had you ever heard of it or seen it before?

1656
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:40,700
I have, yeah.

1657
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:41,700
Okay, yeah.

1658
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:42,700
I just have never played it.

1659
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:45,980
Yeah, it's, I don't know, it's kind of one of those things where it's like, I think it's

1660
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:50,300
an important part of gaming's history because it's like a forgotten game in a legendary

1661
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:51,300
series.

1662
01:28:51,940 --> 01:28:52,940
That's why I picked it.

1663
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:58,660
Didn't they have, was Donkey Kong 3, they didn't have like a, there wasn't like an NES

1664
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:00,140
version of that, right?

1665
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:05,900
I'm trying to remember and even though it really looks like it's on that same hardware

1666
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:09,780
as the classic NES, I actually, I feel like there was.

1667
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:10,780
Can you guys?

1668
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:13,580
Because I can't remember if there was like- Can you live folks fact check me?

1669
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:14,580
Animal Crossing.

1670
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:18,140
You remember the original Animal Crossing with the NES games?

1671
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:22,980
That may have been the only time that I would have actually been able to play that.

1672
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:27,460
I feel like there was an NES cartridge, I mean, this game is very clearly, look at the

1673
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:31,780
font, look at the look of the game, it's very clearly running on that same hardware that

1674
01:29:31,780 --> 01:29:33,580
powered those early NES games.

1675
01:29:33,580 --> 01:29:34,580
Yeah, they got an NES version.

1676
01:29:34,580 --> 01:29:35,580
Okay, thank you.

1677
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:39,780
I was going to say, it had to exist somewhere.

1678
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:42,380
But again, was it released in America?

1679
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:43,500
That would be my other question.

1680
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:45,060
Or was it a Famicom only game?

1681
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:51,820
It's a Famicom and NES, but North America was 1983 and Japan was October 1983, so probably

1682
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:52,820
around the same time.

1683
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:53,820
Probably around the same time.

1684
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:54,820
All right, that's good to know.

1685
01:29:54,820 --> 01:29:57,860
TigerKhan Chat says, this is a game that's deserving of a reboot.

1686
01:29:57,860 --> 01:30:02,740
I don't know if I would go that far, but I don't think it needs to be super ignored and

1687
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:07,300
replaced with Mario in some of the ways that Nintendo has done.

1688
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:09,740
Like, let it be what it is, you know?

1689
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:16,140
So I would like to see Nintendo, why not put this game on the Nintendo library, Switch

1690
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:17,820
Online library?

1691
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:19,100
Why not?

1692
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:20,100
So I don't know.

1693
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:22,620
Or maybe there's something about it that Nintendo cares not to remember.

1694
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:25,500
Maybe because it wasn't so successful in the US, I don't know.

1695
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:27,900
But I remember this game fondly.

1696
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:30,060
An anniversary for Donkey Kong or something like that.

1697
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:31,060
The year of Donkey Kong.

1698
01:30:31,060 --> 01:30:32,060
The year of Donkey Kong.

1699
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:33,060
There you go.

1700
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:34,060
That might be when we see it again.

1701
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:39,580
All right, there it is, once again, a classic game of the week, Donkey Kong 3.

1702
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:41,060
So yeah.

1703
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:42,660
And it's surprising I never picked that before.

1704
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:46,820
I think I had it ready to go another week, and then we flipped it out as last minute

1705
01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:47,820
for something else.

1706
01:30:47,820 --> 01:30:50,140
Because I was like, I thought I'd picked that before.

1707
01:30:50,140 --> 01:30:51,140
But there it is.

1708
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:52,620
I think I had the video pulled and everything.

1709
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:53,620
But there it is.

1710
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:54,620
We're doing it tonight.

1711
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:55,620
Donkey Kong 3.

1712
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:56,620
All right.

1713
01:30:56,620 --> 01:30:58,140
Let's get into some rapid fire news, shall we?

1714
01:30:58,140 --> 01:31:01,540
A lot of other stuff going on in the gaming industry, right, Logie?

1715
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:02,540
Yep.

1716
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:09,300
So starting off with the games of gold for December, we've got looks like Raven Remastered

1717
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:10,540
and Bleed 2.

1718
01:31:10,540 --> 01:31:14,720
Those are going to be our Xbox One games for the month.

1719
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:20,180
And then the Xbox 360 compatible game, we have Saints Row Get Out of Hell.

1720
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:24,100
And that's going to be available as well in December.

1721
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:30,700
And then on the PlayStation side of the house, we have Worms Rumble and Just Cause 4.

1722
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:35,080
Worms Rumble is going to be available on the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.

1723
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:37,420
Just Cause 4 is just PlayStation 4.

1724
01:31:37,420 --> 01:31:39,900
At least that's the PlayStation 4 version.

1725
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:44,860
And then, of course, as mentioned before, they're going to have Rocket Arena is going

1726
01:31:44,860 --> 01:31:50,500
to be available as your kind of premium PlayStation 5 game that's going to be free.

1727
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:54,560
And so that'll be available as well.

1728
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:58,620
And then we've got some fun glitches now.

1729
01:31:58,620 --> 01:32:05,100
So this kind of harkens back for me to Grand Theft Auto 4 and the evil swing set that they

1730
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:08,820
used to have in there where you would be able to fling yourself into the air.

1731
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:11,660
Didn't you have a video like spotlighting some of these bugs?

1732
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:12,660
I do have a video.

1733
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:13,660
It's on our channel actually.

1734
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:14,660
Is it really?

1735
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:15,660
Yeah.

1736
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:17,300
I think it's on the Orange Lounge.

1737
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:21,420
The long forgotten Orange Lounge Radio YouTube page.

1738
01:32:21,420 --> 01:32:23,940
Do you know I was looking at it randomly the other day.

1739
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:28,660
There's still a video on there of you getting drunk playing Mario Kart at the arcade.

1740
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:29,960
It was your bachelor party.

1741
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:30,960
You remember that night?

1742
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:31,960
Yeah.

1743
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:32,960
And we filmed it?

1744
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:34,960
I'm going to remove that.

1745
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:38,840
That's the most viewed video, Loki.

1746
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:40,840
Like 12,000 views.

1747
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:41,840
Wow.

1748
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:43,800
Something like that.

1749
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:44,800
It's pretty.

1750
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:45,800
It's up there.

1751
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:46,800
All right.

1752
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:53,880
Well, so now in Red Dead Online, they have a bridge that is going to allow you to fling

1753
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:55,520
yourself as well.

1754
01:32:55,520 --> 01:33:01,680
So this new bridge currently is near McFarland's Ranch.

1755
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:07,720
And if you throw a projectile weapon into one of the first few slats of the bridge,

1756
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:14,020
it causes the collision just to go crazy and just fling around everywhere, launching yourself

1757
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:17,660
into the air in a pretty hilarious fashion.

1758
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:20,080
So of course they have different videos online.

1759
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:25,060
So definitely go check it out if you play Red Dead Online because they could patch it

1760
01:33:25,060 --> 01:33:28,240
out or maybe they won't because they never did with Grand Theft Auto IV.

1761
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:30,480
They just left it in there because it's something silly.

1762
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:33,040
It doesn't really necessarily break the game.

1763
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:34,560
It's just kind of a fun thing to do.

1764
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:39,480
So yeah, it's pretty cool to see something like that come back.

1765
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:43,800
What do you think about that whole Red Dead Online sold separately thing that was recent

1766
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:46,100
news?

1767
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:48,760
They selling it separately or are they just putting it out for free?

1768
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:51,000
I thought it was like a $5 thing.

1769
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,760
Oh, that's not that bad.

1770
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:58,960
Red Dead Online, I guess that's fine.

1771
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:01,480
I don't know if there's a lot of people playing Red Dead Online.

1772
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:05,800
I would think Grand Theft Auto Online would be something they more interested in selling

1773
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:09,360
separately.

1774
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:14,960
But I mean, that's where they're making most their money is online now with all the microtransactions.

1775
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:17,880
I just don't think Red Dead Online makes as much money as Grand Theft Auto.

1776
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:19,760
Grand Theft Auto has made them a ton of money.

1777
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:22,440
I mean, that's why it's been going for so long.

1778
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:25,920
Was that your cat that just screamed in the background or was that one of your kids?

1779
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,200
Oh yeah, it's always a catch.

1780
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:28,200
No, it's always the cat.

1781
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:33,800
She was in here a second ago screaming because she didn't have more treats or something.

1782
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:35,040
It's like about once an hour.

1783
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:37,560
So yeah, that was a cat.

1784
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:43,400
We finally found treats that Mr. Smoosh likes, by the way, because, you know, there's a story

1785
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:45,240
with our cat, Mr. Smoosh.

1786
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:48,960
He does not like traditional dry kitty treats that you like throw on the ground because

1787
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:51,640
we had a ton of them left over from when Sanrio passed.

1788
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:52,960
We tried to see if Smoosh would be into it.

1789
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,080
Nope, he didn't like it.

1790
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:56,520
But we finally found, I should say, Alan really found it.

1791
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:58,760
He will eat the shit out of those.

1792
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:01,040
There's wet kitty treats.

1793
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:02,600
So we call him Licky Licky.

1794
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:04,880
So we go lick lick Licky Licky.

1795
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:08,560
And it's like this little thing you put pour out of a like little plastic thing.

1796
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:10,680
It's like it's like tuna and gravy or something.

1797
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:12,760
I don't know, some type of interesting little treat.

1798
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:13,800
But he'll he'll get there.

1799
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:17,200
He'll sit right there and go.

1800
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:18,200
He's starting to lick it up.

1801
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:19,460
It's really cute.

1802
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:20,460
So yeah.

1803
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:21,460
Yeah.

1804
01:35:21,460 --> 01:35:24,560
As John Hunter Matt says, Mr. Smoosh only accepts gold plated treats.

1805
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:31,840
You would think so because he only will eat food from the like hoity toity pet food store.

1806
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:34,720
We can't shop for him at PetSmart or Petco.

1807
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:39,180
We have to go to like the natural pet store, you know, in that in that part of town.

1808
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:41,160
And that's where these treats came from as well.

1809
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:43,160
So anyway.

1810
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:44,160
All right.

1811
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:45,160
Moving on.

1812
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:46,660
Sorry, this wasn't supposed to be the cat hour.

1813
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:47,660
But you know what?

1814
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:49,780
It's been a slower Newsweek.

1815
01:35:49,780 --> 01:35:52,820
I say that and then I'm about to really drop a big piece of news.

1816
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:57,280
This is a pretty big deal actually, here in rapid fire news.

1817
01:35:57,280 --> 01:36:00,620
Do you remember the game Saga Frontier on the PlayStation?

1818
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:01,620
Yes.

1819
01:36:01,620 --> 01:36:05,700
Big, big Square Enix title again, I think Dark Soccer spotlighted this as a classic

1820
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:09,540
game not that long ago, because I have to be honest, I didn't care for this game when

1821
01:36:09,540 --> 01:36:10,540
I first played it.

1822
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:13,140
I bought it and I didn't care for it.

1823
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:16,820
But well, we're gonna get a chance to give it a second opinion because Saga Frontier

1824
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:18,860
remastered is coming out.

1825
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:23,700
And again, I don't please do not send hate mail to the show because I said what I said

1826
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:25,380
about Saga Frontier.

1827
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:29,380
You know, you know what else I didn't like the first time I played it was Mass Effect.

1828
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:31,860
And then I gave it a second chance and I fell in love with it.

1829
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:36,080
So maybe a remaster will be a good chance for me to give a game a second chance.

1830
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:39,980
Maybe I just was you know, it was a long time ago that I checked it out on PlayStation.

1831
01:36:39,980 --> 01:36:42,980
I'm kind of in a different place with gaming now than I was then.

1832
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:48,000
So it is but a lot of people remember this game very fondly back from 1997.

1833
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:52,440
So people very excited about this remaster and then it gives people like me a chance

1834
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:54,680
to check it out all over again.

1835
01:36:54,680 --> 01:37:01,760
So it's coming out next summer for Switch, PlayStation 4, Steam, iOS and Android.

1836
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:06,740
That part has me a little concerned because I'm only a little worried that maybe like

1837
01:37:06,740 --> 01:37:13,460
you remember the Final Fantasy like six that they did for iOS and Android.

1838
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:17,680
It's not great and not the way I would prefer to play those games even though they did give

1839
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:19,120
it all new art and everything.

1840
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:24,400
And now that I'm looking at some of what I see here in Soccer Frontier Remastered, I

1841
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:27,640
think it could be a product of the same formula.

1842
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:31,120
So just be what buyer beware.

1843
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:32,160
Wait for the reviews.

1844
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,160
Wait for the reviews.

1845
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:34,160
Yeah.

1846
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:35,680
But you know what?

1847
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:36,680
Maybe they've heard some of the feedback.

1848
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:38,480
Maybe they're gonna make changes.

1849
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:41,640
We shouldn't hold the prior games completely against it.

1850
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:46,000
But I'm just gonna say these are some things that make me a little bit tepidly optimistic

1851
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
about it.

1852
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
We'll see.

1853
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:53,680
But I mean, the videos in the trailer do look very interesting.

1854
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:57,340
There's supposed to be new cut scenes and events and a new protagonist even.

1855
01:37:57,340 --> 01:38:00,620
So that's kind of something different is that they're actually adding to the story a little

1856
01:38:00,620 --> 01:38:01,620
bit.

1857
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:03,200
So that could be very cool.

1858
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:07,800
So check that out when it releases, although we don't have an exact date just yet.

1859
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:09,640
All right.

1860
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:14,900
Moving on, one more story for you, which has to do with AOC or Representative Alexandria

1861
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:15,900
Ocasio-Cortez.

1862
01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:21,300
Now, I'm not gonna report every time she goes live on Twitch, but it is notable to

1863
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:23,460
point out she did go live on Twitch again.

1864
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:27,860
And part of the reason I am bringing it up and we talked about it the first time is because

1865
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:34,720
it is interesting to see more and more politicians start to embrace Twitch as a platform.

1866
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:39,380
And what's particularly notable about this last stream that she did, it didn't get quite

1867
01:38:39,380 --> 01:38:40,460
as many viewers.

1868
01:38:40,460 --> 01:38:42,680
I don't think it had the hype going into it.

1869
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:45,600
And we're also now post-election as opposed to pre-election, which is probably a big part

1870
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:46,600
of it.

1871
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:50,960
But it's still, I mean, when I looked at it, it was like 80, 90,000 viewers.

1872
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:52,480
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

1873
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:58,320
And that's still, you know, the size of two football stadiums worth of people.

1874
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:05,360
But what is notable about this is that she actually had playing among us with her Jagmeet

1875
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:09,440
Singh, the leader of Canada's new Democratic Party.

1876
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:14,960
So this was kind of in collaboration with a notable Canadian political figure.

1877
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:20,880
So it's an interesting kind of crossing boundaries there and now bringing a Canadian figure into

1878
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:21,880
this.

1879
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:26,580
So, like I said, what AOC is doing, other people are noticing, and that isn't just unique

1880
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:28,800
to the US.

1881
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:31,040
So pretty cool.

1882
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:32,320
That all happened the other day.

1883
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:34,440
It still had a pretty high amount of viewers.

1884
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:36,320
I did not catch the whole thing.

1885
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:39,600
I don't know if you guys in chat saw it and have anything to say about it.

1886
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:43,440
Oh, Black and Pat points out they raised $200K for charity.

1887
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:44,440
Pretty cool.

1888
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:48,320
ActDef says we need Bernie playing among us.

1889
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:49,320
You never know.

1890
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:52,600
Bernie did have a Twitch channel, as did Donald Trump.

1891
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:56,800
But in both those cases, which are obviously two very polar opposite sides of the political

1892
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:06,920
spectrum, it was mostly redistribution of other stuff like a televised rally or a televised

1893
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:10,160
interview was also being delivered on Twitch.

1894
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:16,840
What makes what AOC is doing unique and different is that AOC is making Twitch content for Twitch

1895
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:18,080
on Twitch.

1896
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:23,640
So that's where she's kind of breaking boundaries there and bringing other people along for

1897
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:24,640
the ride.

1898
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:27,560
We had Representative Ilhan Omar the first time.

1899
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:30,520
Now we have Jagmeet Singh from Canada.

1900
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:36,520
And who knows who might come play among us, or maybe she'll play another game in the future.

1901
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:38,880
What game do you want to see AOC play next?

1902
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:40,480
That's what I want to know in chat.

1903
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:41,480
What game do you want to see?

1904
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:45,160
Civilization would be a good one, like Civ 6.

1905
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:48,520
That might be a fun one, right?

1906
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:51,000
I'd be very curious to see that.

1907
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
So yeah, Black and Pat saying they raised over $200K for charity.

1908
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:55,440
That's very cool.

1909
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:56,440
Let's see.

1910
01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:59,640
I'm trying to see the other comments here.

1911
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:03,000
A lot of the other comments on SAGA Frontier.

1912
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,840
Act Deft picking another Twitch all-star game right now.

1913
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:08,800
Phasmophobia with AOC.

1914
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:10,040
That might work.

1915
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:11,800
Tigerclaw says Mortal Kombat 11.

1916
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:13,520
I don't know about that.

1917
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:16,400
Akuma JP says RE7.

1918
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:20,320
I don't know if AOC would be down for the jump scare games, but it would be entertaining.

1919
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:23,480
SSG100Matt says Justin Trudeau is a gamer.

1920
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:24,480
Get him.

1921
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:25,480
You never know.

1922
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:26,480
You never know.

1923
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:27,480
How about Minecraft?

1924
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:28,480
Would you watch Minecraft with AOC?

1925
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:29,480
That could be interesting too.

1926
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:30,480
Sure.

1927
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:31,480
Sure.

1928
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:32,480
Why not?

1929
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:33,480
All right.

1930
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:34,480
Or somebody teaching her about a game.

1931
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:38,000
You know, kind of like Conan, but not necessarily funny or for comedy.

1932
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,000
I don't know.

1933
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,000
It'd be interesting.

1934
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,000
All right.

1935
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,560
I don't know what else she plays, but I'm sure there's something.

1936
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:44,560
All right.

1937
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:45,560
Anyhow.

1938
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:46,560
She plays League of Legends, I think.

1939
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:47,560
Oh, does she?

1940
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:48,560
Why does she stream some of that?

1941
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:49,560
That'd be interesting.

1942
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:55,800
Oh, there's a great suggestion from Akdeft, Jackbox Party Pack with AOC.

1943
01:41:55,800 --> 01:42:01,560
That is a great idea, except she would definitely want to have a controlled environment for

1944
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:06,440
that, meaning only select Twitch people, kind of like how she's picking her people to play

1945
01:42:06,440 --> 01:42:07,580
Among Us with.

1946
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:08,580
She hasn't posted her code.

1947
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:09,800
Let anybody join.

1948
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:14,440
I would not want to see that happen with Jackbox either because people, you know, people write

1949
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:16,920
some real obscene things in Jackbox, right?

1950
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:22,600
But if she can get a controlled game of 10 people and then maybe allow randos to join

1951
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:24,400
the audience, because all they would do is vote.

1952
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:29,000
They can't get in there and put things like, you know, fuck, fuck, fuck, or, you know,

1953
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,840
all those other nasty things.

1954
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:33,840
Interesting.

1955
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:34,840
I'd be very I'd be very curious.

1956
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:36,400
Yeah, that might be a fun one.

1957
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:40,760
If it's a controlled environment where she knows who she's playing with and that everybody's

1958
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:44,560
going to keep it G rated because that's you know, she is a politician at the end of the

1959
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:46,200
end of the day.

1960
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:49,560
You know, maybe PG is about as far as you can go PG.

1961
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:50,560
Star Wars is rated PG.

1962
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:51,560
Right.

1963
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:52,560
So you can go about that far.

1964
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:53,560
All right.

1965
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:54,560
Anyway.

1966
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:56,240
Uh, let's move on.

1967
01:42:56,240 --> 01:42:57,240
Interesting.

1968
01:42:57,240 --> 01:43:01,300
Quest Buster says there's a clip floating out there of AOC saying how being patient

1969
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:04,720
in that game dealing with rage quitters helps her in Congress.

1970
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,460
Well, she should.

1971
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:07,460
She should play that on stream.

1972
01:43:07,460 --> 01:43:08,460
Then I'd be very curious.

1973
01:43:08,460 --> 01:43:11,360
Akuma JP says, oh, a large to have an Among Us night.

1974
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,440
You know, we were talking about it and it's my fault.

1975
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:18,240
I didn't follow through on it, but soon I do want to still make that happen.

1976
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:19,240
Maybe just in time for the holidays.

1977
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:20,240
All right.

1978
01:43:20,240 --> 01:43:23,920
In the meantime, let's travel around the world and check out some games you can play besides

1979
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:29,360
just Among Us with some release dates, even though it might be slowing down a little bit,

1980
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:30,360
but not, not really.

1981
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:32,680
Actually, I think I was looking at this week and no, there's still some big releases this

1982
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:33,680
week.

1983
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:34,680
Right?

1984
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:35,680
Yeah.

1985
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,680
It's still pretty busy actually.

1986
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:38,680
So, uh, let me run it down.

1987
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:39,680
Yep.

1988
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:43,360
So, uh, they front load everything in December because you know, holidays.

1989
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:44,360
Sure.

1990

Uh, we've got Tom Clancy's rainbow six siege on PlayStation five and Xbox series X, uh,

1998
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:24,920
I remember that one is free for PlayStation owners.

1999
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:31,640
If you have PlayStation plus, um, salmon max save the world remastered on PC and Nintendo

2000

intend to switch.

2002
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:39,600
That's a mouthful.

2003
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:40,600
Yes.

2004
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:44,600
Absolute drift on Nintendo switch.

2005
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:52,480
That's ironic for Nintendo switch, um, uh, layer Risa two on a loss legends and the secret

2014
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:52,240
Dan, this is a busy week.

2015
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:53,240
Exactly.

2016
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:59,040
Fitness boxing to rhythm and exercise and intend to switch John wick hex on and tend

2017
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:06,360

to Nuki sunset on PC.

2019
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:11,680
And I believe that is it.

2020
01:46:11,680 --> 01:46:12,680
That's enough.

2021
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:13,680
All right.

2022
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:16,400
Actually, Japan, uh, looking at the release dates, they're pretty similar.

2023
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:21,040
There's quite a lot happening this week, uh, empire of sin from Sega releases on December

2024
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:24,840
the first I'm assuming that's kind of dated to match with the rest of the world.

2025
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:28,520
But then when you get to December 3rd, um, you get a lot of, a lot of similar stuff to

2026
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:29,800
what Loki was just talking about.

2027
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:34,960
Although the Japanese versions, uh, most notably on the switch, uh, at layer Risa to lost legends

2028
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:39,000
in the secret ferry, which I think Loki mentioned for the U S as well, uh, sheer in the wander,

2029
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,780
the tower of fortune and the dice of fate.

2030
01:46:40,780 --> 01:46:45,640
That same one is also out in Japan this week, uh, immortals, Phoenix rising, uh, Sumiko

2031
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:47,520
Gurashi, uh, Oh, yeah.

2032
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:54,000
No Sumi day tabby Kaibun sugo Roku, uh, comes out this week, uh, as well as immortals.

2033
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,000
I'm sorry.

2034
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,000
I just said that one.

2035
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,360
Uh, there's some type of remothered double pack is out this week together.

2036
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:04,800
The battle cats gets a price reduction and a game called Derby stallion is released as

2037
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:05,800
well.

2038
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:07,040
And, uh, Oh, I'm sorry.

2039
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:08,040
Those are for another.

2040
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:10,220
Those are some other dates that snuck in here.

2041
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:15,740
Let me look real quick at PlayStation four and five to see what is out in Japan.

2042
01:47:15,740 --> 01:47:20,680
Um, immortals rising on, on PlayStation five this week on Japan.

2043
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:22,500
So there's a new PS five game this week.

2044
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:24,380
That's pretty exciting.

2045
01:47:24,380 --> 01:47:28,420
And looking at the PlayStation four, a lot of the same stuff I read for switch, um, mortals

2046
01:47:28,420 --> 01:47:32,260
Phoenix rising the at layer Risa to, uh, this one's different.

2047
01:47:32,260 --> 01:47:39,580
And then, uh, go by train hash hash hero Yamanote Linae comes out, uh, from square Enix actually.

2048
01:47:39,580 --> 01:47:45,540
Uh, and then, uh, that same double pack, Ooh, as well as the dark pictures, little hope

2049
01:47:45,540 --> 01:47:47,820
comes out on the PlayStation four this week.

2050
01:47:47,820 --> 01:47:49,820
I'm looking up that go by train.

2051
01:47:49,820 --> 01:47:51,640
It's a PlayStation VR game.

2052
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:52,640
That is like a train.

2053
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:55,700
It's a train driving game, but in VR, that's pretty cool.

2054
01:47:55,700 --> 01:47:56,700
Hmm.

2055
01:47:56,700 --> 01:47:58,080
That was neat.

2056
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:00,220
I wish we got more of those types of games here.

2057
01:48:00,220 --> 01:48:02,840
Once in a while though, they'll localize and they sneak through, but most of those

2058
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:04,980
train games kind of skip us by.

2059
01:48:04,980 --> 01:48:09,180
So all right, there you go for Japanese releases, uh, with dark soccer and not here tonight,

2060
01:48:09,180 --> 01:48:12,340
maybe Loki can step in and, uh, talk about the UK releases.

2061
01:48:12,340 --> 01:48:13,340
Yeah.

2062
01:48:13,340 --> 01:48:21,820
So we have Kronos before the ashes on a PlayStation four looks like Xbox one, Nintendo switch

2063

All right.

2087
01:50:44,620 --> 01:50:50,520
Busy week, uh, not usual that the week after Thanksgiving is so busy, but probably a lot

2088
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:54,560
of small delays this year because the pandemic and so forth and, and things are in a weird

2089
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:56,880
place right now because of everything going on in 2020.

2090
01:50:56,880 --> 01:51:01,260
So, um, but I'm sure it's going to start to dry up the next couple of weeks as we start

2091
01:51:01,260 --> 01:51:06,280
to get to Christmas because in Hanukkah, yeah, it's going to start to slow down.

2092
01:51:06,280 --> 01:51:07,280
All right.

2093
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:08,280
Anyhow.

2094
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:12,560
Um, we are going to do some more news stories here and then we will get to your questions

2095
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:17,200

01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:21,640
Let's go to Loki with our next story.

2097
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:25,140
So this is kind of what I'm hoping with my work too, is that they're going to allow us

2098
01:51:25,140 --> 01:51:27,520
to start working from home permanently.

2099
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:33,940
Um, but one gaming company has done that as well, or I should probably one new game company

2100
01:51:33,940 --> 01:51:37,060
has been allowing their employees to do that.

2101
01:51:37,060 --> 01:51:40,200
So Square Enix says they're going to allow most of their employees to work from home

2102
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:45,420
permanently in the new policy goes into effect starting in December, uh, provided that their

2103
01:51:45,420 --> 01:51:46,660
positions allow for it.

2104
01:51:46,660 --> 01:51:51,300
And they have the flexibility to change their designation month to month or on a month to

2105
01:51:51,300 --> 01:51:52,300
month basis.

2106
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:56,060
But they said that they're expecting that 80% of their employees will end up working

2107
01:51:56,060 --> 01:52:01,240
from home, uh, once the program starts, um, well next week, actually.

2108
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:07,380
So, um, I mean, definitely with this type of environment, you know, with the pandemic

2109
01:52:07,380 --> 01:52:12,980
and everything, um, it is nice to see that companies are able to have their employees

2110
01:52:12,980 --> 01:52:17,220
work remotely, as long as they're able to strike a nice work-life balance, that would

2111
01:52:17,220 --> 01:52:18,700
be important.

2112
01:52:18,700 --> 01:52:24,780
Um, I'm totally for working from home, I love not having to drive in.

2113
01:52:24,780 --> 01:52:25,780
It's great.

2114
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:30,580
I think when we talk about that new normal post COVID, you know, I don't think necessarily

2115
01:52:30,580 --> 01:52:31,820
all the news is bad.

2116
01:52:31,820 --> 01:52:35,380
One of those things is that, you know, yeah, like work from home, I think you're going

2117
01:52:35,380 --> 01:52:36,620
to see more often.

2118
01:52:36,620 --> 01:52:39,760
And it's interesting to me with Square Enix in particular, because, you know, with Final

2119
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:44,760
Fantasy XIV, which I play a lot, um, the, the pandemic and the adjustment to the work

2120
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:49,240
at home situation was kind of cited as it was a little rough to get going.

2121
01:52:49,240 --> 01:52:52,520
And that's why they ended up delaying some content for a few months.

2122
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:56,680
Um, they're back on track now and they're moving, you know, at a, at a, they just had

2123
01:52:56,680 --> 01:53:01,200
another live letter this past week for their big, big patch, uh, the Tuesday after this

2124
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:04,200
upcoming one, December 8th, they're doing a big, big content patch.

2125
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:07,240
And it sounds like they're going to release their next, or excuse me, they're going to

2126
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:12,800
tease their next expansion in February, which is about four months off cycle from when they

2127
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:16,280
would have done it normally October, but everything in, in Final Fantasy XIV land kind of got

2128
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:17,520
bumped back four months.

2129
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:21,680
So even though there was a huge adjustment period, it seems like they're kind of used

2130
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:22,760
to it now.

2131
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:26,080
So it's interesting to think that, you know, Square Enix, that would include Final Fantasy

2132
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:29,240
XIV, a lot of that development is going to happen from home now.

2133
01:53:29,240 --> 01:53:31,400
So it's neat.

2134
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:32,440
It's just, it's different.

2135
01:53:32,440 --> 01:53:36,840
It's another way to kind of, you know, but if you think about it, a lot of indie developers

2136
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:38,760
have worked from home for a long, long time.

2137
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:39,480
Right.

2138
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:44,120
So yeah, so games, games can certainly be made from the comfort of your own home.

2139
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:46,400
And I'm sure a lot of people are wondering about their own jobs.

2140
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:51,080
Loki mentioned that too, as Joe and Matt and Chad is saying, I hope, I hope we're able to stay

2141
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:52,040
remote.

2142
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:55,040
I know they're going to be, you know, some changes are coming to my job as well, where it's

2143
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:59,520
going to be kind of like havesies, you know, like some days we'll need to be in the office for

2144
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:01,560
things, but some days we'll be able to work remote.

2145
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:04,160
And that sounds, that's a good balance for me, I think.

2146
01:54:04,240 --> 01:54:07,120
So, yeah, it's going to be interesting to see what it looks like for people.

2147
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:09,680
There's going to be a lot more.

2148
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:12,800
I mean, of course there were people that were working from home before this.

2149
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:17,840
It wasn't a new concept, but now it's just going to be, I think many companies that didn't think

2150
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:22,240
they could had to, and now they've realized, oh, we can do this.

2151
01:54:22,240 --> 01:54:24,800
And I think Square Enix is kind of one of those companies.

2152
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:29,680
So Akuma JP and Chad says security is the only bottleneck.

2153
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:31,120
That's a very interesting point.

2154
01:54:31,120 --> 01:54:31,760
Yeah.

2155
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:35,360
You know, I used to work in the healthcare industry.

2156
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:40,400
And so I would be very curious about, you know, how they were able to make some of that privacy

2157
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:44,960
and security stuff work in the home situation because, you know, it's a very touchy area.

2158
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:45,200
Yeah.

2159
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:46,560
A lot of it's VPN.

2160
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:47,280
Yeah.

2161
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:48,560
So, all right.

2162
01:54:49,120 --> 01:54:51,680
Anyhow, let's move on to another story.

2163
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:58,080
And this one has to do with an actual historical marker, meaning it's one of those places where

2164
01:54:58,080 --> 01:55:00,960
they like actually, they have a sign that marks.

2165
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:02,560
This is the place.

2166
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:04,960
And in this case, it is in New Hampshire.

2167
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:11,360
And it is a new sign that talks about BASIC, the first user-friendly computer programming

2168
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:11,920
language.

2169
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:17,040
BASIC is something near and dear to my heart because the Commodore 64, it was all powered

2170
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:17,520
by BASIC.

2171
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:21,680
I mean, they had machine language and assembly and stuff in there too, but BASIC was built

2172
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:22,000
in.

2173
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,960
You turned on the computer and you were in BASIC programming mode.

2174
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:30,720
BASIC, by the way, is short for Beginners All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code.

2175
01:55:30,720 --> 01:55:31,600
How about that?

2176
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:35,200
It was invented at Dartmouth College in 1964.

2177
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:42,720
And there was actually a column that happened recently in the Concord Monitor where it was

2178
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:48,960
noted that there were 255 historical markers for bridges, historical figures, but there

2179
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:53,760
was nothing about New Hampshire's technical and scientific accomplishments.

2180
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:56,080
So, that's what happened.

2181
01:55:56,080 --> 01:55:58,240
They actually got a historical marker for it.

2182
01:55:58,240 --> 01:56:01,280
It is located on New Hampshire Route 120.

2183
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:05,520
It's not far from Dartmouth College and where BASIC, of course, was created.

2184
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:09,440
State historical markers are always on state highways.

2185
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:13,360
That's why it's not actually on the college itself, but that is pretty cool.

2186
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:16,560
And I hope it becomes a pokey stop, quite frankly.

2187
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:25,600
So, I can say from having reviewed plenty of things in the old Ingress OPR and now Niantic

2188
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:28,160
Wayfarer, I would absolutely accept that.

2189
01:56:28,160 --> 01:56:30,160
As a point of interest, that sign.

2190
01:56:30,160 --> 01:56:32,880
So, that thing better become a pokey stop.

2191
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:37,120
The only thing that would disqualify it is that if there's something real close to it,

2192
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:39,520
that's also a pokey stop already.

2193
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:42,560
But in the picture, it looks like there's nothing around it.

2194
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:47,120
So, I hope it does become a pokey stop and I want someone to send me a gift from there.

2195
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:47,840
Thank you, thank you.

2196
01:56:48,640 --> 01:56:49,040
All right.

2197
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:52,000
SG100 Matt says, it's Dartmouth College.

2198
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:52,960
It'll be a pokey stop.

2199
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:56,400
It's near on the state highway, but yes, it should be, hopefully.

2200
01:56:58,160 --> 01:57:03,040
YYR says, Commodore 64 and 128 basic programmer here.

2201
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:04,720
I made a bunch of shitty math games.

2202
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:10,480
Hey, but shitty math games brought you shitty pixel games in the year 2020.

2203
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:14,640
Questbuster in chat says, 10, print.

2204
01:57:14,640 --> 01:57:16,320
Hello, VOG network.

2205
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:20,160
Now then, all you need is 20, go to 10 and now run.

2206
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:23,280
Perfect.

2207
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:24,240
All right.

2208
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:30,800
Well, congratulations for the push to get that recognized and it actually worked.

2209
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:32,160
I think that's pretty cool.

2210
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:32,960
All right, moving on.

2211
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:34,000
Just a couple more stories.

2212
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:34,500
Loki.

2213
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:36,480
All right.

2214
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:42,960
So, Sony, of course, is touting that their console launch is the biggest console launch ever.

2215
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:49,360
And of course, they didn't really say what their sales figures were, but they basically saying

2216
01:57:49,360 --> 01:57:55,360
that we wanted to confirm that PlayStation 5 is their biggest console launch ever and the

2217
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:56,720
demand is unprecedented.

2218
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:04,960
I remember seeing actually Black Friday there as folks camped out, waiting for new consoles

2219
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:09,600
and stuff, which is kind of crazy in this kind of environment, but that's where we're at.

2220
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:16,640
I mean, I guess scalpers and all sorts of problems with that stuff, but it's still apparently

2221
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:17,600
doing well.

2222
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:18,880
And I think both of them are doing well.

2223
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:23,760
But since no one's releasing figures, we don't really know how to compare.

2224
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:27,680
But once again, why do we need to know that as consumers?

2225
01:58:27,680 --> 01:58:28,480
It doesn't matter.

2226
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:33,120
All it does is feed into the, ha, our team won and your team lost mentality.

2227
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:34,960
So, I get it as well.

2228
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:38,560
Yeah, and Bobby's confirming Microsoft said it was their biggest launch ever as well.

2229
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:40,320
And I remember hearing that in the last week.

2230
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:42,400
So, both consoles are doing very well.

2231
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:43,040
And actually, I will say...

2232
01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:46,480
Who would have thought when everybody's forced to stay at home that home entertainment would

2233
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:47,520
be successful?

2234
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:53,360
Well, and I was more surprised by it being the biggest console launch ever more because

2235
01:58:53,360 --> 01:58:57,920
I would have thought there were less of them out there because of the pandemic.

2236
01:58:57,920 --> 01:59:02,800
So, I would have thought by nature PlayStation 4 did better because there were more of them

2237
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:03,440
when it launched.

2238
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:04,800
But I guess that's not really the case.

2239
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:08,640
That's just me kind of remembering it with rose colored glasses or whatever.

2240
01:59:08,640 --> 01:59:13,520
I think there is something to be said about more people in general are playing games and

2241
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:19,360
more people want these sorts of devices in their homes because the folks that are getting

2242
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:24,240
older and are making the purchasing decisions in their household grew up with video games

2243
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:29,280
all around them, grew up on things like Mario and Donkey Kong 3, Stanley, and things like

2244
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:29,920
that.

2245
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:31,920
People kind of remember that.

2246
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:37,760
So, I kind of think just by nature, there are more gamers and so there's more people

2247
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:39,200
looking for PlayStation 5.

2248
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:44,240
But apparently PlayStation 5 and Xbox X are like the must have holiday gifts this year.

2249
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:48,720
So, they are the Cabbage Patch Kids of 2020.

2250
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:54,080
I don't know if there's an actual toy that's like that this year.

2251
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:57,760
I thought there was supposed to be something, but I'm just hearing about how people are

2252
01:59:57,760 --> 01:59:58,320
going crazy.

2253
01:59:59,120 --> 02:00:04,800
There was a story on the news here locally about people were camping out at the mall

2254
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:07,760
for PlayStation 5 when there were two of them available.

2255
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:09,120
Two of them.

2256
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:11,600
So, interesting.

2257
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:19,440
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says our local gaming bar is almost completely booked for kids parties

2258
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:24,640
from parents who aren't able to get an Xbox or PlayStation 5 for their kids by Christmas.

2259
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:29,680
Black Compat says I've given up on a PlayStation 5 until February.

2260
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:30,480
Yeah, me too.

2261
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:34,080
And I knew when I made the decision I was going to push for Xbox.

2262
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:37,280
I'll get it in 2021 and it'll be all right.

2263
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:39,200
There'll be more games available at that point.

2264
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:43,520
As long as I don't miss Final Fantasy 16, and I won't, we're good.

2265
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:49,520
Bobby Blackwolf says I predicted the animatronic baby Yoda toy would be a hot toy, but I don't

2266
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:50,480
think that happened.

2267
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:50,980
Interesting.

2268
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:56,560
But maybe it's because there's lots of baby Yoda toys out there, but there's only one

2269
02:00:56,560 --> 02:00:57,280
PlayStation 5.

2270
02:00:57,280 --> 02:00:58,800
There's only one Xbox Series X.

2271
02:00:58,800 --> 02:00:59,120
I don't know.

2272
02:00:59,120 --> 02:01:00,800
That's just speculation.

2273
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:01,920
So, anyway.

2274
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:06,480
Act F says I'm going to wait for the new consoles until next year.

2275
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:10,080
This year, I got a Samsung S20 and I've been loving the hell out of it.

2276
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:13,520
Playing Pokemon Go on 120 hertz is a godsend.

2277
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:14,480
Yeah, yeah.

2278
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:15,920
So, all right.

2279
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:18,240
Well, let's move on.

2280
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:20,480
One last story for you guys.

2281
02:01:20,480 --> 02:01:22,240
And it has to do with Google Stadia.

2282
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:29,040
Google Stadia is promising 400 games in development, which, you know, sometimes Stadia gets criticized

2283
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:30,080
because they don't really have enough.

2284
02:01:31,280 --> 02:01:34,560
So, Stadia wants to tell you more are coming.

2285
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:39,840
And these are coming from comments made in an interview with Mobile Syrup by the director

2286
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:45,360
of games for Google Stadia, meaning the actual, like, an actual, as opposed to people on Twitter

2287
02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:49,200
that are, like, kind of not really affiliated with Google Stadia, but making comments.

2288
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:52,160
This person actually is with Google Stadia, director of games.

2289
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:55,840
These games are going to be launching over the next few years.

2290
02:01:56,560 --> 02:01:58,560
Not necessarily all of them in 2021.

2291
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:03,680
In the interview saying my team is almost done with 2021.

2292
02:02:03,680 --> 02:02:05,520
We're thinking about 2022 right now.

2293
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:06,640
That's our focus.

2294
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:10,320
2023 is really kind of where we're aiming our sights.

2295
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:12,400
So, Stadia sounds like it might be a slow burn.

2296
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:17,520
And hopefully, Google will continue to believe in it for that long.

2297
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:22,960
And, you know, again, as much as it sounds like I might be giving Stadia a hard time sometimes,

2298
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:26,800
I want Google to play the long game on this.

2299
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:33,760
And, you know, when we have by 2023, there probably will be more 5G.

2300
02:02:33,760 --> 02:02:37,760
And so Comcast will be needled on that bandwidth cap.

2301
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:41,360
And I think there will be more of a space for things like Stadia.

2302
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:43,840
So I hope that they have the games to kind of back it up.

2303
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:45,360
It'll be very interesting.

2304
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:48,960
But Stadia still doesn't have the ability to just, oh, open up your laptop and play

2305
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:49,840
right in your browser.

2306
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:55,840
I still feel like that's something Stadia promised a year ago that they still need to

2307
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:58,000
really make it that easy.

2308
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:59,680
Not just for Pro, for everybody.

2309
02:02:59,680 --> 02:03:01,520
Yes, I know you can do it in the browser on Pro.

2310
02:03:02,160 --> 02:03:05,520
But I'm talking for everybody and 4K if you want it for everybody.

2311
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:13,600
So anyway, Google has added things like Doom Eternal, Borderlands 3, Hotline Miami,

2312
02:03:13,600 --> 02:03:15,120
Cyberpunk is incoming.

2313
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:19,440
But, you know, the 100 games that are in there still somehow doesn't feel like enough.

2314
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:23,120
But Google does have some first party studios in Montreal and Los Angeles.

2315
02:03:23,120 --> 02:03:26,080
Don't forget, they have some type of development deal with harmonix.

2316
02:03:26,720 --> 02:03:28,320
Fuser wasn't it because that's everywhere.

2317
02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:31,680
So there's another harmonix game that's in development that's going to be a Google

2318
02:03:31,680 --> 02:03:32,880
Stadia thing.

2319
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:36,240
That as a music game fan, that might get me to suddenly perk up and pay attention.

2320
02:03:36,240 --> 02:03:36,640
We'll see.

2321
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:42,160
Don't forget, they have talented folks like Phil Harrison, Jade Raymond, you know, they've

2322
02:03:42,160 --> 02:03:45,680
so we're still waiting for those exclusive games.

2323
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:49,440
But I think the concern is, look, they can.

2324
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:52,720
The thing about Stadia is I don't have to buy one.

2325
02:03:53,440 --> 02:03:58,320
So if Stadia suddenly gets that must have game tomorrow, it'll be pretty easy to go

2326
02:03:58,320 --> 02:03:58,880
in there and get it.

2327
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:02,400
I'm not gonna have to worry about supply issues like we do on the PlayStation 5 or Xbox or

2328
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:03,040
whatever.

2329
02:04:03,040 --> 02:04:05,360
Like that's the whole perk about Stadia.

2330
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:10,160
I think the worry that a lot of us have is Google will pull the plug if it's not successful

2331
02:04:10,160 --> 02:04:11,360
by 2023.

2332
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:16,000
But if Google is committed to playing the long game, then maybe there will be some,

2333
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:19,280
you know, we'll be looking back on these years having a laugh.

2334
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:21,040
Like, why didn't we see this coming sooner?

2335
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:29,040
I just think that their idea with Stadia is it's a good idea, just not for now.

2336
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:35,760
Like it's just like these games streaming services and stuff where it's just not the

2337
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:36,720
right time for that.

2338
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:42,240
Our infrastructure, maybe in other countries like Japan where we have like rock solid infrastructure

2339
02:04:42,240 --> 02:04:44,960
for Internet and stuff and no bandwidth caps.

2340
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:50,960
It may be a great idea in the United States, not a great idea because we have bandwidth

2341
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:51,440
caps.

2342
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:56,880
Our Internet's not fast enough to really drive that, you know, gameplay and stuff.

2343
02:04:56,880 --> 02:05:01,120
Whereas it yeah, in the future when our bandwidth caps are just like let's imagine unlimited

2344
02:05:01,120 --> 02:05:03,840
in our internet speeds like a gigabit down or something like that.

2345
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:05,920
And we can basically stream whatever the hell we want.

2346
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:09,760
That's gonna be amazing because then we'll never have to upgrade our consoles.

2347
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:14,160
It's always just gonna be, you know, the most cutting edge everything.

2348
02:05:14,720 --> 02:05:16,240
And that's the dream right there.

2349
02:05:16,240 --> 02:05:19,840
But we're not living in that time period, unfortunately.

2350
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:23,600
And so I think that's where the struggle is gonna be is that one.

2351
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:27,440
I don't like the idea of having to buy my games.

2352
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:30,560
I think it should be like, you know, especially with a streaming console like that.

2353
02:05:31,280 --> 02:05:34,720
I think it should just be a library they have access to and you pay a monthly fee or whatever,

2354
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:35,440
like games pass.

2355
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:41,200
But it's just too early and this is not the right environment for it.

2356
02:05:41,200 --> 02:05:46,880
It's it's gonna be a hard sell when you're getting charged, you know, for going over

2357
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:48,320
your bandwidth and stuff like that.

2358
02:05:48,320 --> 02:05:51,200
And so that's gonna be the struggle right now.

2359
02:05:51,200 --> 02:05:55,840
I think, you know, five years from now when we maybe move past all that and our infrastructure

2360
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:58,320
is better, then maybe it might be the time.

2361
02:05:58,320 --> 02:06:00,880
But by that time, this will probably be dead.

2362
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:02,800
It'll be the next thing that comes out.

2363
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:09,520
Phoenix7726 in chat with a very good point saying the worry is streaming only and this

2364
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:11,680
shit should not catch on long term.

2365
02:06:11,680 --> 02:06:14,800
Archiving will even be more of a nightmare than it already is.

2366
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:16,160
That is true.

2367
02:06:16,160 --> 02:06:18,240
And it's a completely valid point, Phoenix.

2368
02:06:18,240 --> 02:06:23,520
I think the only issue is that this is kind of where the industry is going, whether we

2369
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:24,240
like it or not.

2370
02:06:25,120 --> 02:06:29,360
You know, and it does also ask a question like, okay, so we've seen that the movie and

2371
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:32,080
the TV industry has kind of gone this way, right?

2372
02:06:32,080 --> 02:06:34,320
But like, look at some of the stuff like Netflix.

2373
02:06:35,200 --> 02:06:37,520
What if Netflix goes ass up tomorrow?

2374
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:40,880
Where are we going to be able to watch things like Stranger Things?

2375
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:48,080
Now, Netflix has done some limited DVD and Blu-ray type of releases, especially for their

2376
02:06:48,080 --> 02:06:51,040
big shows like the one I just mentioned there, Stranger Things.

2377
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:54,160
You know, you can still get that on a more traditional DVD, Blu-ray.

2378
02:06:54,160 --> 02:06:58,080
Same thing with things like Star Trek Discovery and people who haven't wanted to pony up for

2379
02:06:58,080 --> 02:07:02,720
CBS All Access or whatever it's going to be called now, the Paramount, Paramount Premiere

2380
02:07:02,720 --> 02:07:03,600
or whatever they're calling it.

2381
02:07:05,440 --> 02:07:06,000
There's that.

2382
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:10,720
But I'm not so sure that is even going to be the future.

2383
02:07:10,720 --> 02:07:12,320
That's more of a bridge.

2384
02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:17,920
What you're starting to see happen now is you're starting to see more nuanced streaming

2385
02:07:17,920 --> 02:07:21,440
services that offer some of the classic stuff.

2386
02:07:22,240 --> 02:07:26,880
Like there are free TV streaming services that show really old reruns.

2387
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:30,960
You know, I'm not sure there's that streaming service yet where I can watch old episodes

2388
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:31,840
of Mama's Family.

2389
02:07:32,480 --> 02:07:33,200
Maybe there is.

2390
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:35,760
Is it on Hulu maybe?

2391
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:40,080
It might be, but I think you're going to start to see more streaming services start to pick

2392
02:07:40,080 --> 02:07:42,080
up on that archival type of stuff.

2393
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:48,160
And I think long term, gaming goes a similar direction.

2394
02:07:48,160 --> 02:07:53,760
In a way, you're starting to already see it with Antstream, which I know for whatever

2395
02:07:53,760 --> 02:07:56,320
reason still hasn't really launched in the US yet.

2396
02:07:56,320 --> 02:08:00,080
And their client is an on Xbox Series X, even though it's on Xbox One.

2397
02:08:00,080 --> 02:08:02,400
It's one of those kind of few things that doesn't exist on both.

2398
02:08:03,040 --> 02:08:07,440
But as somebody, you know, full disclosure, who backed the Kickstarter and got two years,

2399
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:14,000
even though I'm in the US, I'm able to use Antstream and that is like a classics streaming

2400
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:14,880
service.

2401
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:20,240
So a lot of like, oh, I'm talking old ass fucking Spectrum games and Commodore 64 games

2402
02:08:20,240 --> 02:08:21,680
you forgot about.

2403
02:08:21,680 --> 02:08:22,720
They're on Antstream.

2404
02:08:23,600 --> 02:08:25,680
And I do like that service.

2405
02:08:25,680 --> 02:08:31,040
And I think there's going to be more like it that are going to archive some of these

2406
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:32,000
older things.

2407
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:36,080
There's always going to be some things that slip through the cracks, but just kind of

2408
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:39,680
I guess that's my very long winded answer to that statement.

2409
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:41,280
I'm not saying I like it.

2410
02:08:41,280 --> 02:08:47,040
I still like having physical collectibles, but Netflix is going to still release things

2411
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:49,280
like Stranger Things and the must have stuff on Blu-ray.

2412
02:08:49,840 --> 02:08:54,640
But I think our industry is moving that direction and we have to be prepared that there is going

2413
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:59,440
to be more and more that streaming once more of the bandwidth caps and some of these other

2414
02:08:59,440 --> 02:09:01,200
limitations allow for it.

2415
02:09:01,200 --> 02:09:03,520
That's that's where my head's at right now anyway.

2416
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:11,600
So Phoenix 7726 says if they do it in tandem, then I have less of an issue, but I want download

2417
02:09:11,600 --> 02:09:15,760
still prominent and I want full physical media, not this half ass shit where we get or take

2418
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:16,640
the GOG solution.

2419
02:09:17,280 --> 02:09:23,440
Phoenix 7726 says counterpoint physical media is far more prominent in movies and music

2420
02:09:23,440 --> 02:09:25,760
has DRM free downloads.

2421
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:26,400
And that is true.

2422
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:30,560
And limited run games is still making NES cartridges that are selling.

2423
02:09:30,560 --> 02:09:32,320
So there's always going to be a space for it.

2424
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:35,200
But I think an important thing with movies.

2425
02:09:36,320 --> 02:09:39,920
This is a huge we don't know yet what's going to happen.

2426
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:45,680
But the huge question mark in the movie industry is what's going to happen after the pandemic?

2427
02:09:46,400 --> 02:09:51,360
Once the back end that will have an idea in about a year because, you know, the vaccine

2428
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:53,040
is going to start to get out there.

2429
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:56,320
It will be safe to go to movie theaters again eventually.

2430
02:09:56,320 --> 02:10:03,200
But the question is, will people do it or will the release of Wonder Woman 84 on HBO

2431
02:10:03,200 --> 02:10:09,360
Max and Mulan on Disney Plus Plus, will that have proven to be more lucrative for the movie

2432
02:10:09,360 --> 02:10:11,440
industry than a traditional movie house?

2433
02:10:12,160 --> 02:10:15,440
I kind of hope not, because I still like going to the movies.

2434
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:21,360
But that's I, Loki, do you do you see that that that could be a real, like, scary thing

2435
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:25,360
for the movie industry is that are people even going to come back to the movie theater

2436
02:10:25,360 --> 02:10:27,360
once they've been able to watch Wonder Woman at home?

2437
02:10:28,080 --> 02:10:30,320
Yeah, I think people will will come back.

2438
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:30,820
Yeah.

2439
02:10:31,680 --> 02:10:37,200
I well and I also come from a you know, you know, I have a long standing love love relationship

2440
02:10:37,200 --> 02:10:40,960
with like cult movies and old movie screens.

2441
02:10:40,960 --> 02:10:42,560
And I host Rocky Horror.

2442
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:45,120
I've hosted a cult screening of Scott Pilgrim.

2443
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:48,080
I was supposed to do clue the movie before the pandemic.

2444
02:10:48,080 --> 02:10:50,480
And now it's scheduled next year at some point.

2445
02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:55,040
And there's nothing like bringing a big group of people together to watch a bad movie.

2446
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:00,560
But it's it will movie will movie theaters become a novelty?

2447
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:02,240
Have they become too?

2448
02:11:02,240 --> 02:11:05,520
Are there too damn many movie theaters to meet the demand?

2449
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:06,080
I don't know.

2450
02:11:06,080 --> 02:11:10,560
These again, these are all questions we were going to find out the answer to in the coming

2451
02:11:10,560 --> 02:11:11,060
years.

2452
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:12,320
So, yeah.

2453
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:12,480
Yeah.

2454
02:11:12,480 --> 02:11:17,200
And Phoenix 7726 says also drive ins apparently did well during summer.

2455
02:11:17,200 --> 02:11:19,200
So this could be a time for an interesting rebirth.

2456
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:19,840
Absolutely.

2457
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:24,080
They are always threatening to close that drive in theater here in Sacramento every

2458
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:24,560
fucking year.

2459
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:26,560
I hear a story they're going to do it anymore.

2460
02:11:26,560 --> 02:11:28,000
I don't think they're going to do it anymore.

2461
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:30,720
I really don't this this year.

2462
02:11:30,720 --> 02:11:35,360
If anybody made money, it was that that place because they were going to they were going

2463
02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:36,240
to get there in years.

2464
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:39,280
I would say that they probably need to upgrade it, though.

2465
02:11:39,280 --> 02:11:43,920
They were going to tear it down and replace it with a traditional movie theater on the

2466
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:44,720
same land.

2467
02:11:44,720 --> 02:11:45,840
That's what they were going to do.

2468
02:11:47,040 --> 02:11:47,680
I remember that.

2469
02:11:47,680 --> 02:11:50,240
And he has a century promenade century promenade.

2470
02:11:50,240 --> 02:11:50,740
Yeah.

2471
02:11:51,220 --> 02:11:54,660
Now the question is, are they still is that is that going to be the cost effective idea?

2472
02:11:54,660 --> 02:11:56,820
And I think the answer is no, it is not.

2473
02:11:56,820 --> 02:11:59,940
I think people are now have now found out there is a place for drive ins.

2474
02:12:01,060 --> 02:12:02,900
We wanted to do Rocky Horror at the drive in.

2475
02:12:03,780 --> 02:12:05,540
But it didn't it ended up working out happening.

2476
02:12:05,540 --> 02:12:05,940
They did.

2477
02:12:05,940 --> 02:12:12,420
They did a I think they like showed the movies at drive ins this last Halloween, I think.

2478
02:12:12,420 --> 02:12:16,820
But it ain't Rocky Horror if they're in a cast and all the other stuff that goes on

2479
02:12:16,820 --> 02:12:17,300
with it.

2480
02:12:17,300 --> 02:12:18,260
It's not the same.

2481
02:12:18,260 --> 02:12:19,220
But yeah.

2482
02:12:20,420 --> 02:12:22,420
So yeah, Questbuster says, I hear the same thing.

2483
02:12:22,420 --> 02:12:24,660
Drive ins have gotten very popular because the pandemic.

2484
02:12:24,660 --> 02:12:26,180
It's the only safe place to do shows.

2485
02:12:26,180 --> 02:12:28,260
They're doing drag shows at drive ins now.

2486
02:12:29,780 --> 02:12:30,900
It's the only safe place.

2487
02:12:32,100 --> 02:12:37,780
The political rallies that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were doing were at drive ins.

2488
02:12:38,420 --> 02:12:39,540
It's fascinating.

2489
02:12:40,100 --> 02:12:46,100
So anyway, just it'll be very interesting to see what happens in a year.

2490
02:12:46,100 --> 02:12:48,500
Is everything going to go back to normal in that regard?

2491
02:12:48,500 --> 02:12:52,100
Or have some of our entertainment consumption needs changed?

2492
02:12:52,100 --> 02:12:52,660
I don't know.

2493
02:12:52,660 --> 02:12:54,420
Anyway, good tangent, you guys.

2494
02:12:56,820 --> 02:12:58,020
Listener roundtable time.

2495
02:12:58,020 --> 02:13:00,660
Well, that was a good little side topic.

2496
02:13:00,660 --> 02:13:05,300
If you guys have any other questions or things to ask about or discuss here, send them in

2497
02:13:05,300 --> 02:13:08,740
our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

2498
02:13:09,300 --> 02:13:11,860
We would also open the mailbag at this point in the show.

2499
02:13:11,860 --> 02:13:16,260
If you want to send us an email, participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to

2500
02:13:16,260 --> 02:13:16,900
send emails.

2501
02:13:16,900 --> 02:13:20,260
Unfortunately, this week, no emails, sad face.

2502
02:13:20,260 --> 02:13:24,180
So participate at orange lounge radio.com if you want to send us something for next

2503
02:13:24,180 --> 02:13:24,900
week.

2504
02:13:24,900 --> 02:13:27,380
But I will ask if there's any last minute stories.

2505
02:13:28,020 --> 02:13:29,140
Loki, did you catch anything?

2506
02:13:29,940 --> 02:13:30,340
Yes.

2507
02:13:30,340 --> 02:13:32,500
So there was one thing.

2508
02:13:32,500 --> 02:13:41,940
And so apparently, uh, this guy goes by the name of Doppley has released a remake of the

2509
02:13:41,940 --> 02:13:44,420
two Zelda CDI games.

2510
02:13:44,980 --> 02:13:48,660
So he's remade faces of evil and one of Gamelon.

2511
02:13:48,660 --> 02:13:49,160
Why?

2512
02:13:50,500 --> 02:13:51,140
I'm just kidding.

2513
02:13:51,140 --> 02:13:52,500
Worked on for four years.

2514
02:13:52,500 --> 02:13:52,820
Wow.

2515
02:13:52,820 --> 02:13:58,340
Release them and then took them down, uh, because of, uh, I think he's worried about

2516
02:13:58,340 --> 02:14:00,260
game suit or something like that.

2517
02:14:00,340 --> 02:14:02,100
But, uh, they're out there.

2518
02:14:02,100 --> 02:14:05,780
If you know where to look for them, he put them up long enough for people to get.

2519
02:14:05,780 --> 02:14:06,020
Yeah.

2520
02:14:06,020 --> 02:14:08,020
Alan was telling me about this before the show tonight.

2521
02:14:08,020 --> 02:14:11,620
So, um, I know this is the thing that's going around and it's, so it's, it's not an

2522
02:14:11,620 --> 02:14:14,340
emulator for the CDI disks.

2523
02:14:14,340 --> 02:14:14,980
It is.

2524
02:14:14,980 --> 02:14:19,140
I ripped things from the CDI disks and built this in game maker, basically.

2525
02:14:19,780 --> 02:14:20,580
Basically.

2526
02:14:20,580 --> 02:14:20,980
Yeah.

2527
02:14:20,980 --> 02:14:21,480
Yeah.

2528
02:14:22,020 --> 02:14:26,420
Bobby Black Wolf with the plug for awesome games done quick saying wand of Gamelon will

2529
02:14:26,420 --> 02:14:27,460
be part of that.

2530
02:14:27,460 --> 02:14:29,540
I thought it was awesome games done quick.

2531
02:14:30,900 --> 02:14:31,400
Yeah.

2532
02:14:31,780 --> 02:14:32,340
Just teasing.

2533
02:14:32,340 --> 02:14:32,740
Oh yes.

2534
02:14:32,740 --> 02:14:34,500
Well, there is the awful block.

2535
02:14:34,500 --> 02:14:34,660
Yeah.

2536
02:14:34,660 --> 02:14:35,540
It's part of this.

2537
02:14:35,540 --> 02:14:36,980
I think, I think they call it silly.

2538
02:14:36,980 --> 02:14:38,020
Is it silly games?

2539
02:14:38,580 --> 02:14:43,780
They call it, they, they call it something that's not like demeaning to the games.

2540
02:14:43,780 --> 02:14:44,980
They call it silly game.

2541
02:14:44,980 --> 02:14:45,860
Oh, silly games is.

2542
02:14:46,500 --> 02:14:47,780
Oh, it is awful games.

2543
02:14:47,780 --> 02:14:48,500
Well, all right.

2544
02:14:48,500 --> 02:14:50,020
Then it's starting the awful block, I guess.

2545
02:14:50,020 --> 02:14:50,180
Yeah.

2546
02:14:50,180 --> 02:14:55,940
It's awful block because they have like, uh, Superman 64 and the CDI games.

2547
02:14:55,940 --> 02:14:59,140
And, um, I'm trying to think of some of the other ones.

2548
02:14:59,140 --> 02:15:04,500
I don't know if Pepsi man is part of the awful block, but it, you know, a lot of silly stuff

2549
02:15:04,500 --> 02:15:05,000
like that.

2550
02:15:06,260 --> 02:15:06,980
Uh, Dr.

2551
02:15:06,980 --> 02:15:11,060
Tia says if Nintendo goes after it, would that count as acknowledging the CDI Zeldas?

2552
02:15:11,060 --> 02:15:13,220
Ooh, it does put Nintendo in an interesting paradox.

2553
02:15:13,220 --> 02:15:13,720
Doesn't it?

2554
02:15:15,940 --> 02:15:19,300
I think they'd still have to probably shut it down out of, you know, protecting their

2555
02:15:19,300 --> 02:15:23,060
trademark and that whole thing and making sure they never make a deal like that again.

2556
02:15:24,100 --> 02:15:24,580
Sorry.

2557
02:15:24,580 --> 02:15:25,700
Like no fan games.

2558
02:15:26,660 --> 02:15:28,500
It's like, no, this was actually official.

2559
02:15:28,500 --> 02:15:29,000
Oh.

2560
02:15:29,940 --> 02:15:34,900
Um, so I referenced it earlier in the show, but I'll mention here during last minute stories.

2561
02:15:34,900 --> 02:15:41,380
Uh, there was that whole kerfuffle going on with, uh, Uri, Uri Geller, the, the, you know,

2562
02:15:41,380 --> 02:15:46,020
the guy he goes on, goes on TV and does like, um, like, uh, I think he was bigger in the

2563
02:15:46,020 --> 02:15:47,380
seventies and eighties.

2564
02:15:47,380 --> 02:15:52,900
He's basically a magician, but he claims to be, you know, tuned into the psychic stuff

2565
02:15:52,900 --> 02:15:53,860
and Ben spoons.

2566
02:15:53,860 --> 02:15:54,660
That was his big thing.

2567
02:15:54,660 --> 02:15:55,700
You like Ben spoons.

2568
02:15:55,700 --> 02:15:56,420
Oh yeah.

2569
02:15:56,420 --> 02:15:57,140
Remember that guy?

2570
02:15:57,700 --> 02:16:02,980
He had, they had a show, he had a reality show phenomenon.

2571
02:16:02,980 --> 02:16:08,740
I think it was called, I remember it because that guy, Chris angel, who is really unpleasant

2572
02:16:08,740 --> 02:16:09,540
was on it too.

2573
02:16:09,540 --> 02:16:15,380
And like him and a contestant like fucking fought, which I thought was weird, but yeah,

2574
02:16:15,380 --> 02:16:16,340
that was Uri Geller.

2575
02:16:16,340 --> 02:16:24,100
Anyway, the point is he had apparently got into it when Nintendo, like 20 years ago over

2576
02:16:24,100 --> 02:16:29,380
the character Kadabra, you know, there's Abra, Kadabra, Alakazam.

2577
02:16:29,380 --> 02:16:35,220
Well, Kadabra has a spoon and then the anime and shit, like he does, like he has the spoon

2578
02:16:35,220 --> 02:16:41,220
of his, and apparently the Japanese name is something like Uri Geller or something.

2579
02:16:41,220 --> 02:16:44,100
It's like something that's very similar to the guy's name.

2580
02:16:44,100 --> 02:16:49,540
So like Nintendo basically kind of had to admit, yes, it was partially inspired by him.

2581
02:16:49,540 --> 02:16:54,500
And so they took the character, Kadabra has not been in the anime since then.

2582
02:16:54,500 --> 02:16:57,140
They don't even have the cards anymore and all this.

2583
02:16:57,140 --> 02:17:02,020
Well, this past week, Uri Geller basically said, I'm dropping it.

2584
02:17:02,020 --> 02:17:03,540
I, and he apologized.

2585
02:17:03,540 --> 02:17:06,180
He's basically saying, I'm sorry for this 20 year old issues.

2586
02:17:06,180 --> 02:17:07,780
I'm now lifting the ban.

2587
02:17:07,780 --> 02:17:10,900
And if Nintendo wants to remake the card, they can, but they're going to have to do

2588
02:17:10,900 --> 02:17:11,060
it.

2589
02:17:11,060 --> 02:17:14,660
I imagine it will make the cards more valuable, LOL basically.

2590
02:17:14,660 --> 02:17:18,020
And so not sure what brought him to have a change of heart.

2591
02:17:18,740 --> 02:17:21,380
Perhaps he had a grand kid or a kid or something.

2592
02:17:21,380 --> 02:17:22,260
Say something about it.

2593
02:17:22,260 --> 02:17:22,660
Maybe.

2594
02:17:22,660 --> 02:17:23,060
I don't know.

2595
02:17:23,060 --> 02:17:23,780
It could be anything.

2596
02:17:24,660 --> 02:17:28,260
But yeah, it was kind of an interesting piece of news to come out of nowhere after 20 years

2597
02:17:28,260 --> 02:17:31,940
that, oh, the Pokemon Kadabra can exist again.

2598
02:17:31,940 --> 02:17:33,300
Thanks to Uri Geller.

2599
02:17:33,300 --> 02:17:34,260
So it's kind of interesting.

2600
02:17:34,900 --> 02:17:36,180
So that is interesting.

2601
02:17:36,180 --> 02:17:36,680
Yeah.

2602
02:17:37,940 --> 02:17:42,260
Act Deft in chat says like, it's good that he finally gave in, but it was pretty shady

2603
02:17:42,260 --> 02:17:46,100
of him to actually promote himself while having a change of heart.

2604
02:17:46,100 --> 02:17:50,820
Yeah, it a little bit, but he did have a change of heart.

2605
02:17:50,820 --> 02:17:52,260
So there's that.

2606
02:17:52,260 --> 02:17:59,460
Plus, a lot of things you have to really sell yourself when you're one of those types of

2607
02:17:59,460 --> 02:17:59,780
people.

2608
02:17:59,780 --> 02:18:00,340
You know what I mean?

2609
02:18:00,340 --> 02:18:01,620
It's about the personality.

2610
02:18:03,780 --> 02:18:06,660
Bobby Blackwell is pointing out the other games in the awful block.

2611
02:18:07,300 --> 02:18:10,820
Wand of Gamelon, King's Quest, Mask of Eternity.

2612
02:18:11,460 --> 02:18:19,300
Peanut Bee, Wings of Adventure, Epic Dumpster Bear 2, He Who Bears Wins, Snow White and

2613
02:18:19,300 --> 02:18:20,740
Happily Ever After.

2614
02:18:20,740 --> 02:18:21,460
Oh, God.

2615
02:18:22,740 --> 02:18:23,380
That's right.

2616
02:18:23,380 --> 02:18:25,940
Didn't they do a sequel to Snow White in the 90s?

2617
02:18:25,940 --> 02:18:28,980
And then they did a game based on it, and it was fucking awful.

2618
02:18:29,940 --> 02:18:32,500
I don't think it was a Disney thing either.

2619
02:18:32,500 --> 02:18:35,780
I think it was like the rights to the book became public domain or something.

2620
02:18:35,780 --> 02:18:36,280
I don't know.

2621
02:18:36,760 --> 02:18:40,680
Anyway, yeah, because the same thing happened with Oz.

2622
02:18:41,960 --> 02:18:46,840
Disney got the rights to Oz, and they made Return to Oz, which was not well received.

2623
02:18:47,400 --> 02:18:53,080
But if you were a kid in the 80s like me or Loki, that movie scared the shit out of me

2624
02:18:53,080 --> 02:18:54,200
when I was a kid.

2625
02:18:54,200 --> 02:18:57,160
That was a fucked up thing to show kids in the 80s.

2626
02:18:57,160 --> 02:19:05,960
When you start a movie with asylum and shock therapy, and then a woman that was able to

2627
02:19:05,960 --> 02:19:09,160
take off heads and stuff like that, it's a little creepy.

2628
02:19:09,160 --> 02:19:10,520
That was creepy.

2629
02:19:10,520 --> 02:19:11,480
Anyway, yeah, exactly.

2630
02:19:12,200 --> 02:19:13,080
And let's see the other game.

2631
02:19:13,080 --> 02:19:15,560
Sorry, we got a tangent thanks to the Snow White sequel.

2632
02:19:16,520 --> 02:19:19,720
Alcatraz Prison Escape and Mr. Bones.

2633
02:19:20,760 --> 02:19:21,480
So there you go.

2634
02:19:21,480 --> 02:19:25,400
And Bobby confirming that the Snow White game was a Super Nintendo game.

2635
02:19:25,400 --> 02:19:29,080
Yeah, that's about the right time frame, because I think I remember being in high school, and

2636
02:19:29,080 --> 02:19:30,360
it was like a big ass deal.

2637
02:19:30,360 --> 02:19:34,280
They were releasing a sequel to Snow White, but I don't think it was Disney.

2638
02:19:34,280 --> 02:19:37,560
It was another company that did it, and it was garbage.

2639
02:19:37,560 --> 02:19:39,560
It was a garbage movie.

2640
02:19:39,560 --> 02:19:41,240
It was really bad.

2641
02:19:41,240 --> 02:19:44,360
So anyway, all right.

2642
02:19:45,240 --> 02:19:46,920
Any other last minute stories?

2643
02:19:46,920 --> 02:19:49,800
If you guys have any questions for us in chat, now's a good time to shout it out.

2644
02:19:52,360 --> 02:19:54,760
No, I didn't really have anything else, I think.

2645
02:19:54,760 --> 02:19:55,800
Okay, that's fine.

2646
02:19:57,800 --> 02:20:00,120
Let's see, looking at some other comments in chat.

2647
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,720
Bobby's saying it was obviously the overnight block.

2648
02:20:03,720 --> 02:20:08,280
With my luck, that will be one of my shifts, because I said I like Sierra games.

2649
02:20:08,280 --> 02:20:09,560
You know what, Bobby?

2650
02:20:09,560 --> 02:20:12,360
I would be honored to do the King's Quest Mask of Eternity.

2651
02:20:12,360 --> 02:20:15,240
I, it's bad, yes.

2652
02:20:15,240 --> 02:20:16,120
Is it awful?

2653
02:20:17,480 --> 02:20:18,520
I don't know, maybe.

2654
02:20:18,520 --> 02:20:19,400
I don't know.

2655
02:20:19,400 --> 02:20:24,920
I think, Bobby, if you get King's Quest, I think you should smile and accept that.

2656
02:20:24,920 --> 02:20:27,880
All right, let's see.

2657
02:20:28,840 --> 02:20:30,840
Some folks talking about Pepsiman.

2658
02:20:30,840 --> 02:20:31,880
Oh, thank you, Rama.

2659
02:20:31,880 --> 02:20:32,920
Rama found it.

2660
02:20:32,920 --> 02:20:40,520
MeTV is the streaming service with mama's family at metv.com.

2661
02:20:41,240 --> 02:20:41,640
Thank you.

2662
02:20:43,320 --> 02:20:49,240
ActDeft in chat says, in Mexico, video game news, the Mexican government is finally releasing

2663
02:20:49,240 --> 02:20:53,480
their version of the ESRB, and it's like, really?

2664
02:20:53,480 --> 02:20:54,920
Wow, that did take a long time.

2665
02:20:54,920 --> 02:20:56,280
That was a little bit delayed, wasn't it?

2666
02:20:56,920 --> 02:20:58,200
All right, awesome, awesome.

2667
02:20:59,400 --> 02:21:00,360
All right.

2668
02:21:00,360 --> 02:21:03,960
Anyhow, all right, I think that's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

2669
02:21:03,960 --> 02:21:07,560
Thank you guys very much for tuning into our show this week, whether you listen live here

2670
02:21:07,560 --> 02:21:12,760
at Twitch, or you downloaded us on the podcast feed on iTunes or Spotify, or most of the

2671
02:21:12,760 --> 02:21:15,080
places where you can find podcasts, we really appreciate it.

2672
02:21:15,080 --> 02:21:15,880
Thank you.

2673
02:21:15,880 --> 02:21:16,920
Help us spread the word.

2674
02:21:16,920 --> 02:21:19,640
Tell a friend or two about our show.

2675
02:21:19,640 --> 02:21:22,680
Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if

2676
02:21:22,680 --> 02:21:25,560
the voices aren't here to put out on air, then you don't have them here.

2677
02:21:26,280 --> 02:21:31,720
So thank you again to those of you that are here, those of you that auto host us on Twitch.

2678
02:21:31,720 --> 02:21:32,520
Thank you, thank you.

2679
02:21:32,520 --> 02:21:34,120
That goes an awful long way.

2680
02:21:34,120 --> 02:21:36,680
Thank you to all the new follows and bits and subs.

2681
02:21:36,680 --> 02:21:39,880
I'll acknowledge those after the credits tonight here on Twitch.

2682
02:21:39,880 --> 02:21:41,560
And just thank you for being here.

2683
02:21:41,560 --> 02:21:45,240
I know it was a busy week with the holidays, so appreciate you guys still being here tonight

2684
02:21:45,240 --> 02:21:48,040
and making room for OLR at your dinner table.

2685
02:21:49,320 --> 02:21:51,640
With that, I think we'll go around and get final thoughts.

2686
02:21:51,640 --> 02:21:53,240
Oh, before I do, though, I have to mention this.

2687
02:21:53,240 --> 02:21:56,760
My God, I should have mentioned this at the top of the show and I forgot, but I want to

2688
02:21:56,760 --> 02:21:59,560
make sure here at the end, I acknowledge our shop.

2689
02:22:00,440 --> 02:22:01,320
We have a brand new...

2690
02:22:01,320 --> 02:22:05,880
I know why I didn't say it because we said it a lot last week and we were kind of like,

2691
02:22:05,880 --> 02:22:07,640
okay, you don't have to sell it so much.

2692
02:22:07,640 --> 02:22:14,120
But I do want to mention over at the VOG Network shop, over at vognetwork.com slash shop, we

2693
02:22:14,120 --> 02:22:16,600
now have some OLR related items.

2694
02:22:16,600 --> 02:22:20,440
And Loki, again, you're finding this out here because I just put them up about an hour before

2695
02:22:20,440 --> 02:22:21,240
we went on air.

2696
02:22:21,240 --> 02:22:28,280
But your OLR pixel art that became an Xbox official avatar years ago, which sadly you

2697
02:22:28,280 --> 02:22:29,320
can no longer get.

2698
02:22:29,320 --> 02:22:35,160
But that OLR pixel art is now available as a sticker so you can make anything OLR.

2699
02:22:35,160 --> 02:22:35,960
It's one of those nice...

2700
02:22:35,960 --> 02:22:39,960
It's actually cut in the shape of the OLR logo with like a white border around it.

2701
02:22:39,960 --> 02:22:41,320
So it's a really nice looking sticker.

2702
02:22:41,320 --> 02:22:42,520
I kind of want to get one of those.

2703
02:22:42,520 --> 02:22:43,800
So you can make anything OLR.

2704
02:22:43,800 --> 02:22:47,480
And we have some OLR pixel art shirts and you can put them on.

2705
02:22:47,480 --> 02:22:50,360
And I picked a different shirt than the VOG shirts.

2706
02:22:50,360 --> 02:22:53,720
They're a little more expensive, but they kind of look like a baseball jersey.

2707
02:22:53,720 --> 02:22:55,080
I think they look kind of cool.

2708
02:22:55,080 --> 02:22:57,320
So we'll see if anybody takes interest in those.

2709
02:22:57,320 --> 02:22:59,000
I'm totally getting one of those.

2710
02:22:59,000 --> 02:22:59,500
Yeah.

2711
02:23:00,520 --> 02:23:00,760
Yeah.

2712
02:23:00,760 --> 02:23:05,160
Act Def says, I still have that OLR Xbox avatar on the Xbox profile.

2713
02:23:05,160 --> 02:23:05,960
Me too.

2714
02:23:05,960 --> 02:23:07,480
Thank you guys that still rock that.

2715
02:23:07,480 --> 02:23:08,040
There is a...

2716
02:23:08,040 --> 02:23:09,880
There's a Bobby Black Wolf one out there too.

2717
02:23:09,880 --> 02:23:12,280
But again, you can't download them anymore.

2718
02:23:12,280 --> 02:23:13,080
They were...

2719
02:23:13,080 --> 02:23:16,200
And it has nothing to do with the fact that we aren't on all games anymore because that

2720
02:23:16,760 --> 02:23:19,480
that it was a pack of all games.

2721
02:23:19,480 --> 02:23:23,960
All the shows on all games at the time had like a gamer pic that went to Xbox Live.

2722
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:30,120
And they just, they pulled it after like four years or something like that.

2723
02:23:30,120 --> 02:23:32,440
So it was available for a long time, but sadly not anymore.

2724
02:23:34,200 --> 02:23:37,720
Very few, what was I gonna say?

2725
02:23:37,720 --> 02:23:41,880
Very few of the people are even rocking the old school type of avatars.

2726
02:23:41,960 --> 02:23:47,800
Because ever since Xbox released their version of the Miis, their avatars,

2727
02:23:47,800 --> 02:23:50,040
that's kind of what a lot of people use now.

2728
02:23:50,040 --> 02:23:52,680
So it's very, very rare you see the old school stuff.

2729
02:23:53,720 --> 02:23:59,400
And SSJ100 Matt says, please put the stickers on personal items and not random folks property.

2730
02:23:59,400 --> 02:24:03,720
Yes, please do not use the sticker as graffiti because that just makes us look bad.

2731
02:24:03,720 --> 02:24:04,680
So thank you.

2732
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:07,800
Akuma JP says, need an OLR mug.

2733
02:24:07,800 --> 02:24:08,520
It's coming.

2734
02:24:09,160 --> 02:24:09,640
Wait.

2735
02:24:09,640 --> 02:24:15,800
I'm waiting for Loki to finish the VOG pixel art that matches the OLR one,

2736
02:24:15,800 --> 02:24:20,840
because we're gonna do a mug that has OLR on one side and VOG on the other, both in pixel art.

2737
02:24:20,840 --> 02:24:21,560
So that is coming.

2738
02:24:21,560 --> 02:24:22,200
I'll work on that.

2739
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:22,700
It's coming.

2740
02:24:23,320 --> 02:24:23,820
All right.

2741
02:24:26,360 --> 02:24:26,680
All right.

2742
02:24:26,680 --> 02:24:27,240
That's it.

2743
02:24:27,240 --> 02:24:28,440
We're gonna wrap up.

2744
02:24:28,440 --> 02:24:29,560
Oh, we didn't get final thoughts.

2745
02:24:29,560 --> 02:24:29,880
Sorry.

2746
02:24:29,880 --> 02:24:30,120
Sorry.

2747
02:24:30,120 --> 02:24:32,200
I just remembered to put that plug out there.

2748
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:34,360
We are gonna make a mug.

2749
02:24:34,360 --> 02:24:38,120
Pixel Pacas, there is a Bobby Black Wolf mug available in the store right now, however.

2750
02:24:38,120 --> 02:24:41,640
And, you know, Bobby is absolutely worthy of showing support too as well.

2751
02:24:41,640 --> 02:24:43,640
So, uh, uh, check that out.

2752
02:24:43,640 --> 02:24:45,160
Anyway, vognetwork.com slash shop.

2753
02:24:45,160 --> 02:24:45,400
Okay.

2754
02:24:45,400 --> 02:24:45,800
I'll stop.

2755
02:24:45,800 --> 02:24:47,480
I'll stop, uh, the advertisement.

2756
02:24:48,040 --> 02:24:49,160
Let's get to final thoughts.

2757
02:24:49,160 --> 02:24:49,660
Loki.

2758
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:58,280
Um, so I'm just gonna be working on my game this week and I still shooting the launch this year.

2759
02:24:59,320 --> 02:24:59,640
All right.

2760
02:25:00,440 --> 02:25:04,120
My final thought is, uh, the new Pokemon go level should be this week.

2761
02:25:04,120 --> 02:25:07,320
So I hope I hit 41 by next week.

2762
02:25:07,320 --> 02:25:07,800
We'll see.

2763
02:25:08,120 --> 02:25:09,400
We'll catch up on the show.

2764
02:25:09,400 --> 02:25:11,320
Uh, stay safe, everybody.

2765
02:25:11,320 --> 02:25:15,240
If you did have a big Thanksgiving out there because, um, you just, you weren't able to

2766
02:25:15,240 --> 02:25:19,720
get out of family obligations, even though there's a pandemic going on, um, please, uh,

2767
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:23,000
limit your interactions out there in the real world.

2768
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:26,360
Uh, at least 10 days, really 14 is even better.

2769
02:25:26,360 --> 02:25:31,640
Um, please do your part to help stop the spread of COVID-19 because it's, it's everywhere.

2770
02:25:31,640 --> 02:25:34,360
You guys it's, it's pretty, uh, pretty scary.

2771
02:25:34,360 --> 02:25:38,760
So, um, you know, if you have to stick to yourself and play some video games for a couple

2772
02:25:38,760 --> 02:25:41,160
of weeks, there's really never been a better time.

2773
02:25:41,160 --> 02:25:42,680
So, uh, that's it.

2774
02:25:42,680 --> 02:25:43,880
Stay safe, everybody.

2775
02:25:43,880 --> 02:25:48,520
We'll be back in seven days to talk more video games and more stuff here on OLR.

2776
02:25:48,520 --> 02:25:49,720
Jamie will be back.

2777
02:25:49,720 --> 02:25:53,240
We have the, uh, exciting straight shit from YYR games.

2778
02:25:53,240 --> 02:25:54,680
So very excited to get that as well.

2779
02:25:54,680 --> 02:25:57,880
So it's going to be a busy December here at VOG Network and OLR.

2780
02:25:57,880 --> 02:25:58,760
Have a good night, everybody.

2781
02:25:58,760 --> 02:25:59,720
We'll see you next time.

2782
02:25:59,720 --> 02:26:00,220
