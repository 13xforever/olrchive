1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,360
I've always envied the difference of music culture in Japan. Since I started playing

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,200
imported games, I also learned about the number of albums they release. Everything from official

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,940
OSTs, remix or remake OSTs like the Final Fantasy piano and vocal collections to doujin

4
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,280
released by the producers themselves. But here in the States and on the internet at

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,500
large the story is very different and I don't wish the legal hassle on anyone. Join your

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,500
hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki as they explain this and the rest of the week's

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,500
news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,140
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio Live. Once again tonight episode

10
00:00:53,140 --> 00:01:00,560
number 843 of our show for this November the 15th of 2020. My name is Rob Roberts and

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:06,320
I'm joined here as I am live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network with my co-hosts

12
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,140
say hello first and foremost to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

13
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,140
Hello.

14
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,140
Hi Jamie, how are you doing?

15
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:22,080
Oh I'm on week four but I'm finally starting to feel better. I'll put it this way my tests

16
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,080
are negative but my doctor hasn't ruled out COVID.

17
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,900
Oh interesting. I've heard of false negatives and things like that so.

18
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,900
Well the thing is is that I also did the serology test and the serology test is pretty much

19
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:43,220
useless because a good portion of the population doesn't create antibodies.

20
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,700
Well hang in there I'm glad to hear you're at least on the mend and doing better.

21
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:55,800
Yeah I basically have one more week of recovery and then I'm clear so.

22
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Sounds good.

23
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,640
It's just my voice has been cutting out so but I can talk a little bit longer just it

24
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,000
still is kind of like sounding like you know that fry.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,520
I'm really looking forward to the day when all of us can be in the same studio again

26
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,600
I know it's still several months out but just really looking forward to that day so.

27
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,800
Just wait until we have a competent administration.

28
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:22,460
I know 65 days anyway before I introduce everybody else it's no secret obviously this

29
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:27,920
week new game console release week it's a big week and dark soccer we've talked before

30
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,900
on the show about how you guys are kind of waiting for a little bit so I thought since

31
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,560
you are the queen of classic games I thought I'd put you on the spot with a different question

32
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,140
here and I'm going to open this up to our chat as well because of course we do tape

33
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,540
live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network twitch.tv slash a vog network Sunday

34
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,860
night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwell show

35
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,660
so the question is we're going to be talking about some launch games that came out and

36
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,700
you know some other things too but looking back on all of the systems throughout history

37
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:00,300
and all of the various launch titles we've had like you know.

38
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,740
Games that have launched consoles there's been some good ones there's been some terrible

39
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:09,220
ones I'm kind of curious dark soccer if you have a particular favorite or maybe memorable

40
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,860
launch title in your heart.

41
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,780
I am putting her on the spot I didn't warn her about this question so she might need

42
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,740
a little time to think but I'm putting you all on the spot in our chat room as well if

43
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:26,900
you guys have any questions or any any questions of course you have questions.

44
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,180
There were definitely ones that I like but I think the one that really just stuck itself

45
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,560
out as memorable for me actually I've got two that I can name because I just remember

46
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,800
how how cool it felt you know was a I'm pretty sure Super Mario World was a launch title

47
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:49,680
it was yeah I mean I remembered Super Mario Brothers wasn't initially so I kind of was

48
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,520
getting into a little bit mixed but yeah Super Mario World was like one of the big ones for

49
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:03,440
me we had gotten my mom's like that year should we get your brother a Super Nintendo or Genesis

50
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,440
and I'm like you're getting them Super Nintendo and it's for me so I told her what games to

51
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,760
get I was like I don't care what else you get but you have to get you know a link to

52
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:23,800
the past you know but Super Mario World was for me just the big thing that made me super

53
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:31,560
super excited about having a Super Nintendo I played the shit out of it my brother sucked

54
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:39,400
at it but you know they were like 10 something like that and I probably played it so much more

55
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:47,480
than they did I've beaten it completely by myself when the game first came out and when I dedicated

56
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:56,920
a lot of time to link to the past after that but that really stuck out for me and then another one

57
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:07,000
was Sonic Adventure because remember we had our our Dreamcast pretty much right after the

58
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,920
Japanese launch and we played so much Sonic Adventure and you know looked for all the

59
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:23,480
glitchy stuff and everything I really really enjoyed Sonic Adventure I was really into it

60
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:30,760
of course it had some of my favorite Japanese voice actors in it like for Knuckles at this

61
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:37,240
time okay I have to also explain I had a minor obsession with with Hayashi Nobutoshi who was also

62
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:46,040
he was Tatsuki in Fushigi Yugi he was Basara in Macross 7 got a really amazing singing voice

63
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:57,560
and you know so and he was you know he he was in the game and I he was Knuckles he was Knuckles

64
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:05,400
voice actor and so I was really really just enamored with the game I liked playing Amy even

65
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:13,080
though she was a little bit annoying I liked the music in it I was so enamored so when the US

66
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,120
Dreamcast launch happened so I actually have to rewind a little bit more for that because there

67
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:26,360
was the rental before launch and we did rent a US one yeah yeah and that demo version that was the

68
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:35,800
US one and then after that when we got our our US Dreamcast we just played through Sonic Adventure

69
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,160
again of course I had to switch the voices back to Japanese because after playing it so long in

70
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:47,240
Japanese the US voices were disjointed to me it was just not saying the voice actor was bad I'm

71
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,440
just saying that I was still used I mean I have the same problem with anime today like if I go

72
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,880
watch any Dragon Ball I have to watch it in Japanese because those are the voices I heard

73
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:01,960
first right um I still prefer Ranma in Japanese because I watched it that way first Sailor Moon

74
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:08,280
same thing you know um so uh the one of the few anime that I'm not like that with is those who

75
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,760
hunt elves because I first watched it in English and I got used to those voice actors so it's kind

76
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:21,000
of um but but going back to it um you know I I those two were probably the big ones that stick

77
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,440
out in my head as far as um some of the more memorable ones all right um great yeah I really

78
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,280
loved it great answers um let me add some stuff in chat and then I've got to introduce uh the

79
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:38,040
other folks on tonight's show who've been waiting patiently uh so uh let me see uh act def says

80
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,280
breath of the wild is definitely one of the best launch titles ever yeah nintendo certainly knows

81
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,840
how to launch a console huh I like this answer from bobby blackwolf my favorite xbox 360 launch

82
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:54,920
title was geometry wars and she hulk 10 says dead rising 3 for xbox one was and is awesome I forgot

83
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,560
that was a launch title and yeah the dead rising series that was a good one all right uh waiting

84
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,960
patiently and with us every week say hello of course to tech master loki joining us tonight

85
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,440
hello hey loki how are you doing I'm doing okay what are you running behind you tonight is that

86
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,800
is that final fight like a sequel not the first one what is that no it's cadillacs and dinosaurs

87
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:22,600
I have an idea for like I've seen that for um a game I was supposed to put behind me and like

88
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,080
I had it like earlier this week I was like oh yeah I saw a game like yeah I need to do that one and

89
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:33,640
completely forgot it today oh no like mo wiki was it that I saw like it was something that I saw out

90
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,360
there I was like oh yeah I totally remember that I need to put that behind me but nope completely

91
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,200
forgot so my memory has always been terrible it's been getting worse as I get older and now it's

92
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,280
getting even worse because this whole quarantine situation and they actually say that like you

93
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:53,160
know it's it's contributing to people having the brain fog and all that stuff so it's uh

94
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,440
welcome to old age loki yeah I don't know if it's that it's just there's you know different things

95
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:04,920

96
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,040
like um sam and max I can't remember if I've done that already because of all the like sam max news

97

98
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,720
and I was like oh yeah I need to do that and then immediately like today I was like okay wait what

99
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,560
game was that I was thinking of so I have it really quickly come up with something all right

00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,960
yeah I feel better good still run down I'm actually feeling run down but that's okay

113
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,760
I've got dr pepper and I have to study for a test tomorrow so I'm gonna be up all night

114
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,320
yeah and for those um that missed uh the episode you were here what about like four or five weeks

115
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:43,800
ago um on the show and you were right in the midst of three was it wow time flies uh you were

116
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,640
right in the midst of battling covid last time you were on the show but you came here anyway to talk

117
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,360
about I think it was the pokemon dlc you were talking about that night so um and you you were

118
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,720
kind of like lying in bed still but tonight you're you're propped up you've got you know that light

119
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:05,720
effect I know I'm in my I'm in my computer chair my little corner in the living room and I'm using

120
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:13,000
my brand new iphone 12 pro math oh rub it in why don't you shaky I don't have a web so this is just

121
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,240
what has to work no honestly the phone works I'm using the phone for this particular shot here

122
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:23,160
that's going out on twitch right now so it works all right um but uh part of the reason I brought

123
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,320
you here tonight was because uh if you've been listening to orange launch radio then you know

124
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,280
that I want to get an or I've gotten an xbox pre-ordered one of those uh we'll talk about

125
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:37,800
how that went because it wasn't so smooth loki got an xbox none of us really have playstation

126
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:46,440
5 represented here uh so shane you got a playstation 5 this week right and so so you've

127
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:53,160
got both so I want to talk to you about how this week went so obviously um this is a big week uh

128
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,160
last week our show got cut short abruptly unfortunately thanks to the internet which

129
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,640
I'm hoping is holding in there more steady tonight knock on wood but I've had less problems this week

130
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:07,240
which is good um but um last week we were still able to talk for an hour and a half we talked a

131
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,920
good chunk about how we are on the dawn of a new generation with playstation and xbox launching

132
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,000
new consoles you know and we were kind of wondering you know is it too early for them to

133
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,880
be doing it is it going to be worth it and all this and now we have a lot of answers to many of

134
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,520
those questions um echoing something that bobby said uh he goes on of course before us here at the

135
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:32,040
voice geeks network echoing something that he said uh is that well clearly the launch went

136
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,840
great because they're selling out so no these consoles didn't go or I'm sorry no these consoles

137
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:41,640
didn't come out too early because they're selling out so it's going very well and yeah the consoles

138
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:49,560
have been very hard to obtain um loki I'll start with you uh on the xbox series x so tell us how

139
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,880
that went for you the ordering process and kind of what you've been playing on it I figured we

140
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,920
usually do a kickoff topic here on tonight's show and then we do our gaming weeks but this week the

141
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,960
big topic is our gaming weeks so we're just going to kind of jump into it so loki I'm going to kind

142
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:09,320
of ask you about your gaming week with the xbox series x sure so like the ordering process it was

143
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:15,880
basically when those orders were opened up originally back in september I just had all

144
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:21,080
the different you know retailers online uh all their sites open and walmart happened to be the

145
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:26,200
first one that let me put something in my cart and submit the order so that's what I went with

146
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:31,720
and so I was always I was kind of worried that it may not arrive on time or at all because I

147
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,880
had issues with my mario kart live where came to be launch day and they hadn't even shipped yet

148
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,120
so I had to cancel that one but thankfully I was able to get that in store um I knew that wouldn't

149
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:48,920
be the case with the xbox series x so um other than that I mean it was fine it arrived on time

150
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,520
like I said you know I was worried that it would be here late um because originally they were

151
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:59,400
estimating the 12th but it arrived on the 10th and I was like cool and uh

152
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,720
uh so really what I've been playing on I don't really have a ton of stuff so I haven't had an

153
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:12,840
xbox since the 360 so I finally got games pass ultimate and I just was downloading some stuff

154
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,720
on there actually I was looking at all my xbox stuff I have on there like 94 games because of

155
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:24,520
my old 360 games of gold stuff um so there's quite a bit old 360 games I have but I don't

156
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:32,440
really have a lot of um xbox one games I guess I have a few with like crackdown and uh forza

157
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:39,080
because I purchased those on pc uh which is nice but um so I ended up getting yakuza like a dragon

158
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,320
because I wasn't really sure of what launch games I really wanted there was nothing really kind of

159
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,440
standing out and I was trying to look at look for something that was really showing off the series

160
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:54,600
x and really the only thing they have is like forza horizon 4 and I already have that so I

161
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,480
started downloading that it's taken a long time but I think it's finally downloaded now I've been

162
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:06,120
mainly playing yakuza um which is interesting because I've never played a yakuza game before

163
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,520
and this one is more like a um an rpg so they've they actually set up because the main character

164
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:21,480
is a huge fan of dragon quest and so it's all turn-based combat which I I love it it's great

165
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:29,080
cool um the story is a bit slow but it's just like it really feels like playing like a dragon

166
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,560
quest or final fantasy game it's just kind of funny in that sense I I heard that I heard that

167
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,040
that was um like that that it was more like an old school rpg so it's kind of more of a spin-off

168
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,800
game so you know and I've had people for years telling me you need to get into yakuza you need

169
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:47,000
to get into that series I wonder if the fans of the series would think this is a good one to start

170
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,480
with or no don't start here definitely different because the other ones are brawlers I mean this is

171
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:57,160
still a brawler but it's turn-based so it's different um it's all right I mean it's certainly

172
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:04,600
not like a huge powerhouse like pretty looking game I mean it does look um not like it's pushing

173
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,120
the high-end graphics or anything like that but I don't know it's all right I I've enjoyed it a

174
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,280
little bit I haven't been playing a whole ton because I've been working on my game but I did

175
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:20,200
play like a probably like five hours of it so far and it's all right it's just there's so much story

176
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:25,240
and we're like I'm still like in the tutorial section of the game haven't even gotten very far

177
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:32,120
and it's just it's so much dialogue like I get it but there's like some of it doesn't really

178
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,200
it's just like dragging out so long like oh my god and they have options to skip past dialogue

179
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,720
but I'm like worried I'm missing something but I'm really not missing anything um so I don't

180
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:50,280
know it's just it's really slow to get started but it is somewhat interesting the story is

181
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:55,400
interesting enough it's just it's like oh my god when are we going to get to like the actual like

182
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:01,640
game um but the action's cool so there are some action sequences and stuff in the game um I don't

183
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:06,840
know I I enjoy it so far we'll we'll see how long I play through it and everything um aside from

184
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:11,960
that I did try Minecraft a little bit because my kid wanted me to play it and honestly I can't say

185
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:19,640
that it looks any different that's definitely not a game that would uh benefit from the series x now

186
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:27,320
saying that once they do push out the ray tracing stuff which I have played on pc uh that does

187
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:33,240
look really great like if they can do that on a series x then that would be definitely one to

188
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:40,040
revisit because it looks really good when they do that um but right now obviously it doesn't

189
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:47,080
look any different than it did before um I saw it in the list I haven't downloaded it yet but

190
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:53,880
lost odysseys on games pass since I was like we should go back to lost odyssey um but no I've

191
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,320
been really kind of just going through there to see you know what really um showcase the system

192
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:05,640
I know Ori um might be a good one um fours horizon like I said I've already downloaded that but like

193
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,680
I'm worried I don't want to fill up the hard drive already with this all the games out and stuff and

194
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:18,920
I mean hopefully still uh we have uh cyberpunk coming out in you know a little less than a month

195
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,400
yeah we definitely definitely don't want another delay on that for sure yeah so hopefully that

196
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,520
comes out but yeah I'm gonna jump in here because I I forgot we have a time constraint with shane

197
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,120
so I want to make sure he's able to um get his impressions especially with the playstation 5

198
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,960
and so forth so I'll come back to you though loki if you have more to add um but shane how

199
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:43,080
was your week with the new consoles how did that go for you um so pretty easy for me in terms of

200
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,840
getting them we've talked about like the magical powers I have for things like persuasion for

201
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:56,520
people to get stuff done and I'm also an expert at getting in line for things which is kind of how I

202
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:02,760
got at least one of these consoles um so xbox whatever you guys are going to talk about that

203
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,800
I haven't really done much with it to be completely honest um real quick why why is

204
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,600
the xbox taking a back seat for you because it wasn't the console I was originally getting I

205
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:22,040
only got it under a weird circumstance so um okay ps5 I went to best buy because I had gotten a

206
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,680
pre-order there and I went at six in the morning because that was my time slots because they were

207
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:34,760
doing time slots to pick up uh your system and literally there were probably about 20 people 20

208
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:40,200
25 people that were there for the same time slot like they were all people that had it pre-ordered

209
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:47,400
it was a pretty smooth process except I saw if you haven't seen the box I can't really reach it

210
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,960
right so whatever it has a little handle on top so you can carry it it's one of those like cheap

211
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:58,680
little plastic handles isn't it it's really flimsy and I saw three people hold it by the

212
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,920
handle and the handle snapped while they were holding it and the console come crashing down

213
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:10,520
to the floor as they were walking out of the store yike so yeah that wasn't good um otherwise

214
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:17,800
I I don't want to say I'm a Sony fanboy but I tend to just play on their products mostly besides

215
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:25,320
Nintendo and uh I love my ps5 the controller is fantastic it's just basically the same as

216
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:32,760
what the joy cons were trying to do but a little more advanced feeling um for launch games I've

217
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:41,320
I got four I got Demon's Souls which I haven't played yet I just installed it I got the Miles

218
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:46,520
Morales game that came with Spider-Man 1 and so I played a little bit of Spider-Man but not Miles

219
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:54,760
Morales yet uh I got the Sackboy game haven't even opened it yet or installed it and I got

220
00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:01,720
Godfall I did install that and I played that for probably a good hour and a half pretty fun little

221
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:11,000
like hack and slash loot game um and it's really pretty and that's what I guess I didn't realize

222
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:21,960
I was missing on my um on my consoles was like a really nice high definition 60 frames per second

223
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,080
experience and that's what I'm getting with these new games I don't I don't switch it to oh no I

224
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:34,440
don't switch Godfall into the pretty fancy ray tracing mode because it just chugs if you do that

225
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,880
but if you keep it on performance it's beautiful and really fast Spider-Man though super cool

226
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:45,880
looking at 60 frames a second but I keep it on the visual fidelity mode because it's really

227
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:52,360
really nice looking I can deal with 30 frames a second problem and Astrobot to me Astrobot is so

228
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:58,040
good I don't care if it's just like Playstation propaganda throughout the entire game it's such

229
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:02,440
a nostalgic trip for some of the things I've seen I love it I've heard a lot of good things

230
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,400
about Astro Boy considering you know I think most people are kind of I'm sorry Astrobot

231
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,840
Astro Boy is a different thing considering so many people were um like overlooking it as just

232
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,760
just kind of writing it off as oh the tech demo game that you know they're just kind of throwing

233
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,840
in there because it's cheap but it really seems like a lot of social media is really taking to

234
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:26,440
this game like no it is it's a strong game on its own just for like you're saying the nostalgia

235
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,880
features and being able to kind of show everything off like it's it seems like it's a much better

236
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:35,880
kind of deal than one two switch same oh yeah for sure and it really gets you acquainted with

237
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:43,640
the controller and all the things that are uh available to to uh be used for that fancy new

238
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:50,600
controller um we'll see if in even six months time if other games are taking advantage of it

239
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:56,680
Godfall didn't really feel that special um in terms of like fun controller things neither did

240
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:05,240
uh regular Spider-Man so uh we'll see maybe maybe more people will look to Astrobot now that it's

241
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:11,320
out more developers will and really see what they can do with that um just tell me if you have to

242
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:16,200
go by the way but um I I want to ask you this question kind of about the since I don't you know

243
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,680
you're kind of like our PlayStation 5 voice tonight what do you kind of think like do you

244
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:27,160
feel like this console is like a huge step up from the four like what is this like really bringing to

245
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:36,040
the table for you that's exciting so the load time and that's something I can like even speak

246
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:42,440
to on the Series X the load times make all the difference in the world it feels like for example

247
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:48,760
besides Astrobot probably the game I played most on the PS5 is Fuser um from Harmonix I

248
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:54,760
wondered when you were gonna bring that up yeah because these are so good um so I just downloaded

249
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,080
it all I was playing a little bit on PS4 when it launched then I was like screw it I'm not even

250
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:07,640
going to keep my PS4 out here anymore so let's just move everything to PS5 and just I can't

251
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:14,200
believe how I was sitting through load times before this these systems it's just I never

252
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:22,680
want load times again but the trade-off is at least for now I'm already onto like maybe 400

253
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:30,760
under 400 gigs left on my PS5 for storage space and that sucks that like Spider-Man both of them

254
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:37,560
together were already 100 gigs that's like almost under just under a seventh of the entire hard

255
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:44,920
drive that you get or no just under about a six yeah it sucks like I don't know what they need

256
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:51,320
to do I don't know what the industry needs to do to make these things cheaper but that's I guess

257
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:59,000
I guess beautiful graphics fast loading ridiculous face constraints that's what the new generation

258
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,800
feels like um at least we know the space stuff is upgradeable later on um if but it's kind of

259
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,480
expensive those I mean at least the official like solid state drives are kind of expensive

260
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,480
I mean a regular USB drive not so much but then you're missing that perk of the loading time which

261
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:18,440
yeah over on Series X which I'll talk about in a minute I'm definitely noticing like wow this

262
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,600
really changes things with the loading time it's pretty impressive I don't even have time to switch

263
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,960
to like the right input on my Series X before it's already up like I'll hit the button on the

264
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,960
controller to turn on the system and I hear the noise and then I reach for the remote and turn it

265
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,720
to the right input and it's already there it's instant it's pretty amazing um tell us quickly

266
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,240
before I let you go about about Fusor like what is it about that game you love so much

267
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:49,000
I love drop mix and Fusor is just drop mix without physical cards and you get to make a character

268
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:57,320
and you get a weird camp mode and it has like rhythm based mechanic like timing and it's so

269
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:04,760
much fun I just just hope it's not like I hope it gets supported for longer than six months

270
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:10,440
because that feels like the average harmonics game or even that might be stretching it um but

271
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:16,840
I already want more dlc I went all in on it got the big fancy pack uh I pre-ordered so I got three

272
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:24,440
more songs and literally uh you make like your own sort of deck thing your own box of different like

273
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:30,920
music cards and every single box I make like there's three songs I keep in there I don't care

274
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:37,560
if it has to be like if they're focusing on like uh rock music or if they're focusing this box on

275
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:45,640
uh rap and r&b and stuff like that or country like I always keep freaking ghosts and stuff

276
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:55,560
by deadmau5 and rob swire eyes by rufus soul and the other one keep in there oh where's your head

277
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:01,560
at my basement those three are always in every box I make because I refuse to let them go because I

278
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:09,880
I always throw the vocals on over uh with one of those songs I can't stop um are they gonna uh

279
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,960
I thought I was reading this might be a thing but let's say you wanted to so obviously shared play

280
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,160
is the thing in the sony universe if you wanted to share play your playstation 5 but I'm only

281
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:25,080
on playstation 4 am I going to be able to see that or does that not work interesting we'll have

282
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:31,640
to try it because I haven't tried any like I haven't really done a lot okay so here's how it

283
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:38,280
is oh I got two new fancy consoles what do I do last night I play pokemon it's just you know like

284
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:43,480
I'm sitting 15 feet away from them looking at them and I'm like oh but I should probably go shiny

285
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:49,160
in pokemon that's a good idea I get it though because like you know I have shiny new consoles

286
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:54,120
and we're still signing on to play final fantasy 14 and do dungeons so you know I will not put

287
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,840
that on my ps there is no space for that game yeah I'm good with keeping that on my computer

288
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,600
all right uh shane I know I I gotta let you go because you have another uh thing you gotta do

289
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,440
but um thanks sorry I know you had to sit there for a long time but uh we have a lot to say sorry

290
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:16,520
about it um but I'm sure we'll have you back again soon okay okay take care buddy bye all right um

291
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,840
so while I fix the camera settings here live on twitch um loki anything else you want to see on

292
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:25,560
the xbox because I had to cut you off a little bit sorry no it's fine so it's funny enough like

293
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:30,360
I was looking at uh some of the playstation 5 games that have come out like especially like

294
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:38,040
the footage of um spider-man miles morales and even like uh sack boy and um astro bots and stuff

295
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:44,040
kind of makes me want to playstation 5 but I'm certainly waiting until next year when um I don't

296
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:50,520
think they're gonna go down in price but when there's um more availability and maybe when

297
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:59,720
playstation vr2 gets announced or is coming out um so we'll see when that happens but um definitely

298
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:05,960
in the short run like I think there's more um interesting games on the launch end for

299
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:11,320
playstation 5 but the reason I picked an xbox series x is because I feel especially with all

300
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,320
these company acquisitions and bethesda and everything that there's gonna be a lot more games

301
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:23,000
exclusive games coming to the xbox side of things um it's definitely a game pass machine and that's

302
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,760
not a bad thing yeah yeah and what's cool though like too like with yakuza like say for example if

303
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:34,200
I don't want to have that on my uh like I feel that this game's kind of a grind fest I was like

304
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,480
man if I could really run this with like trainers and stuff on pc it'd be great and I can because

305
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:46,120
it's all cross by so I have it on pc too when I make a purchase on xbox um series x or on the

306
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:53,320
xbox marketplace so like I could essentially download it to my pc if I have not enough space

307
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:59,960
on my series x interesting um yeah because they've been doing the cross by thing for a little bit

308
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,200
because like I remember forza horizon on xbox one and there's been several titles on xbox one

309
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,520
a lot of especially like the real first party microsoft stuff was cross by and that's why

310
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:13,240
there's a lot of people that are like why do I need to get an xbox if I have a pc I don't need

311
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,800
to get which is fine sorry I shouldn't do a voice with that but for some people it's what I hear

312
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,280
because I feel like they're trying to take a dig at xbox but I realize some people have that very

313
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:27,080
measured approach to where it's like I've got a top of the line pc there's not really anything

314
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:32,120
micro the xbox going to do for me and I do kind of get that but like if you sign up for game pass

315
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:37,160
microsoft still got your money yeah I don't think they care whether you get a system or not I think

316
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,320
it's long as you're playing their games they don't really care and and that's the thing it's

317
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:47,160
like if you don't want to get you know an xbox series x right now maybe there's not something

318
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,960
that you want to play on it you can always get games pass or whatever and play their games and

319
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,320
they come out you don't have to pay any additional money for it so it's not too bad I honestly so

320
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:02,200
this is going to be a really weird statement but I'm gonna this is my early thought like and I I

321
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,600
think the series x is great I'm gonna get my impressions in a minute but I almost feel like

322
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:12,200
what game pass is bringing to the table and eventually what sony is going to have to respond

323
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,920
with their with their own you know playstation plus library sorry I always get the name wrong

324
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:21,000
of that but you know they're they're equivalent essentially I almost feel like the next generation

325
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,680
in some ways is more about that and the transition to that kind of ecosystem than necessarily about

326
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:32,680
more bigger graphics and ray tracing and okay the loading times yeah I mean that is that is certainly

327
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,840
a big difference but I almost feel like that other transition is going to be more representative of

328
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:43,640
what we went through in this generation from the last generation if that makes sense so all right

329
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:49,960
yeah so anyway um let me talk a little bit about my uh story with the series x so it actually is

330
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:57,080
a little bit interesting because um what ended up happening is that I got the um series x on

331
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:03,320
amazon I pre-ordered it there the day it went live for everybody and um I got that email on

332
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,800
monday that a lot of people got that said oh uh you're not going to be getting that console until

333
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:13,080
december 31st you know at some point until then some so I knew I wasn't going to be getting it

334
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:19,240
tuesday so um I was like crap I've got to go find somewhere that I can actually like try to

335
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:24,280
find one of these on shelves so shane said he heard that best buy and target were doing things

336
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:30,360
so he was on best buys website I was on target's website and I was able to get one long story short

337
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:36,040
at target so I went into a store and picked one up at target um and you could I had to go to the

338
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:41,880
other side of town to do it but I was I was like hey I got one whatever I'm good so that process

339
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,680
honestly was pretty easy um they didn't shrink wrap the box or anything they didn't even put it

340
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:51,240
in a bag they and there's no handle on that box so the dude just kind of brought it out was like here

341
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,920
you go and like handed me the box which I had to take take this xbox series x out to the parking

342
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:03,160
lot to my car like just no way to hide it but you're mugging yeah I know right thankfully it

343
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,880
was still light out and there's signs at target they're everywhere that are like security cameras

344
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:14,040
still in use uh that whole thing but I made it home um and again a big reason why I opted for

345
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:22,920
series x as opposed to playstation 5 is because I have a playstation 4 pro I don't have an xbox 1x

346
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:28,520
so I figured the jump from xbox one the xbox series x was going to be a bigger jump and I

347
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:35,720
really think I was right um so one of the games I've been playing a lot of on series x is no man

348
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:41,080
sky yep I never shut up about that game and I've started that game probably over like seven times

349
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:46,200
well guess what bitches I started my eighth playthrough thanks to a game pass and having

350
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:54,680
that on series x you will notice if you have xbox the new one if you go into the game pass library

351
00:33:54,680 --> 00:34:01,720
it has a little icon in the corner that says enhanced for xbox series x or s has a little logo

352
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,040
for that so you can actually see the games and uh no man's sky of course is one of them we talked

353
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:10,840
about on last week's show that it was going to be getting that and um there's a bunch of others too

354
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:16,840
dead by daylight forza horizon the new ori game um and so forth so there's there's plenty of games

355
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:23,480
that have gotten the upgrades and did I notice the upgrades for no man's sky on series x um compared

356
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:31,560
to playstation 4 pro yes I did um it number one is the loading times my god like I used to have

357
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,200
to sit there for a minute and a half you know while it's loading into the galaxy in my plate

358
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:41,240
that now it's down to seconds it's like 20 seconds 30 seconds um something like that it's

359
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:52,840
it's crazy um and um I I notice the graphics um I I do notice a little bit of pop in um but I

360
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:58,120
noticed that on any of the consoles or I've I've noticed pop in on pc I just think it's part of how

361
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:05,080
the algorithm is in that game um but the thing that kind of strikes me is that I notice the high

362
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:10,600
definition textures even on things that are in the distance and that's probably the biggest thing

363
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:15,640
that I noticed playing on series x versus playing on any other system I've played on I've played

364
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:21,240
that game on a lot of systems um especially I will say I played no man's sky just a little bit

365
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:28,040
on xbox one when it first went to game pass it's it's garbage on the original xbox one compared to

366
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:33,400
what it is now like the game the game hasn't changed but the graphics like night and day

367
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:40,360
night and day it looks so much better so um I uh yeah I enjoy uh I enjoy I'm enjoying uh

368
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:44,760
no man's sky again I've probably dropped easily like 10 hours on the latest playthrough

369
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,920
I am blowing up my twitter with screenshots because that's one of my favorite things to do

370
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:55,240
in that game because I just like you know I people say no man's sky is kind of like minecraft and

371
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:01,720
there is it's it's definitely crafting is the backbone of the game um but minecraft to me

372
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:06,120
everything looks very samezy you're either overground you're underground you're in the

373
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:10,280
nether you know but there's only so many different environments that's the thing about no man's sky

374
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,720
that really strikes me is that every time you go to this new planet it's going to look a lot

375
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:18,440
different from where you were at before yes there's there's some basic types that they all

376
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,000
kind of fit into but there's definitely enough variety and enough rare stuff that happens to

377
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,680
kind of keep things exciting and that's that's part of why I really enjoy no man's sky um here's

378
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:34,920
the other interesting thing I noticed with series x though is that because I didn't do xbox 1x

379
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:43,240
there's some games that were already enhanced for xbox 1x that I kind of missed so I went to

380
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:48,440
go check some of those out too so some of the other games I played this week I played skyrim

381
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:55,000
the definitive edition whatever the they call the remaster one because alan is back into playing

382
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,840
that on pc so he's playing that a lot so I was like oh I'll download this to show it to him on

383
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:05,960
xbox and we were both kind of taken with wow this looks really good like you know it's like playing

384
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:11,080
max settings on a pc but it's on my tv and the frame rate very good like when you're looking

385
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:15,080
around and stuff that whole opening when you're in the back of the cart and everything sometimes

386
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,680
you know the frame rate could get a little weird there if you're looking around a lot of pop in on

387
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:25,240
the trees and stuff looks very fluid on the xbox series x you definitely notice it so I think

388
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,720
that's another thing that you know it's very similar to how if you're playing playstation

389
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:35,080
4 games on playstation 5 it's like oh like god of war is like 60 frames a second now like

390
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,640
everything's like running better a lot of that is happening with the xbox one games too I think

391
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:45,560
even on things they're not advertising our xbox series s or x the other one that I played a little

392
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:56,200
bit of that I was like wow this looks so good was final fantasy 15 and you know that game has

393
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:03,640
its pluses and it has its minuses but I will say it looks great in 4k um but you know I I that was

394
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:08,840
the first time I'd really gotten to play that in true 4k so um kind of interesting uh other games

395
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:14,280
I checked out on the series x this week uh I checked out tetris effect connected I did not

396
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:20,680
like that multiplayer is only restricted to ranked or play with friends so there's no casual

397
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:26,120
mode that's unranked I was a little disappointed in that otherwise it's um tetris effect without

398
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:33,160
the vr part which is still a great game and worth uh you taking a look at if you have a game pass or

399
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:38,520
what have you um and then forza horizon 4 I looked at briefly for a little bit and of course that

400
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:43,880
game looks great too and it's just one of those things where how fast that game moves that game

401
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:49,240
moves so fast and it looks so good while it's doing it so I I definitely am noticing like

402
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:56,520
the fluid like you get more constant 60 frames a second things look really good in the distance

403
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:02,600
as well as they do close up I am noticing some of those like subtleties in this new generation but

404
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:09,720
are the games themselves different yet well no because most of the launch games are all bumped

405
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:15,240
back especially on the xbox side we barely got anything on the xbox side you got the yakuza you

406
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:21,960
got assassin's creed and stuff but nothing that really feels distinctly next generation and I'm

407
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,440
imagining it not until the new halo game or something really strong first party or really

408
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:32,200
going to see that but that being said I'm very I'm very happy with the xbox series x it's like

409
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:37,080
getting a brand new video card in the computer and a new chip and like getting that upgrade that

410
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,760
really gives it a kick in the pants and now you want to go back and play all your old favorites

411
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:45,640
to see how smooth they run again it's very that and that's that phase we're in right now while we

412
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:52,760
wait for these other big launch titles so um some comments from chat I'm sorry I've been ignoring

413
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:57,800
you guys um Bobby Blackwell says yeah I've been playing Final Fantasy 15 on my xbox 1x and it's

414
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:05,080
beautiful um let's see uh bonds 006 says I'm playing Tetris Effect with a girlfriend on xbox

415
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:09,960
she will learn the ways of Tetris well Tetris is for for everybody boys and girls and

416
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:17,640
everything uh all the peoples um let's see um sj100 matt says I'm really getting a series x

417
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:22,360
first to play game pass and at some point cyberpunk I will be getting uh enjoying

418
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:27,480
forest horizon 4 when I eventually do get my series x which will be some time week of thanksgiving

419
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:34,280
um act def says which of these will rob end up with more of no man's sky playthroughs or copies

420
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:39,320
of mass effect 3 uh this would be like my eighth no man's sky playthrough but it's not my eighth

421
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:44,680
copy of no man's sky uh it's just I've started a new playthrough every time they do a big patch so

422
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:49,400
I think no man's sky is gonna have a beat Bobby Blackwell says I think no man's sky also got a

423
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:55,720
playstation 5 upgrade yes it did uh and I would fully expect all the nice things I said about

424
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:00,440
xbox excuse me all the nice things I said about no man's sky on xbox series x are probably going

425
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:06,040
to apply to the playstation 5 as well and anybody jumping up from an original playstation 4 version

426
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:13,000
I'm I'm fairly positive you're going to think all those same things um so there is that um

427
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:19,960
I will say I've noticed a few bugs in no man's sky I tweeted one of them I died instantly on

428
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:25,640
loading one of my saves that was a bummer but you know things happen um and uh sometimes when the

429
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:30,600
aliens tend to hold objects or they're talking to you and the objects kind of vibrate and shake

430
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:35,880
and move everywhere like they're not staying in one place um I feel like these are things that

431
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:41,000
we're gonna see a patch from hello games in a week or two the only thing that broke the game was that

432
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,480
loading bug and I feel like that may not be I feel like that may just happen in that game and it may

433
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:53,800
not be exclusive to an xbox thing I feel like you can probably get that on pc honestly so there is

434
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:59,880
that um okay um I think that's pretty much all I need to say on my gaming week uh Loki any anything

435
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:05,800
else on the xbox that I missed no not really I can't think of anything are you happy with your

436
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:11,640
purchase so far do you think are you glad you got one now um yeah I'm happy that I got it I'm gonna

437
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:17,000
be really happy once cyberpunk comes out even though I already have it purchased on pc um I'll

438
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,400
get it twice I guess um I don't know I mean I probably didn't need it right away but

439
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:30,840
you know it's it's better just to get it now and then instead of trying to fight to get it later

440
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:36,600
on I guess all right well let's see if anybody wants to add anything to their gaming weeks outside

441
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:42,200
of these new consoles so dark soccer I'll start with you because I'm sure your gaming oh you just

442
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:50,200
popped up you good to go okay uh and you just I didn't you might be muted still but um how was

443
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:56,040
your oh there you go okay how was your gaming week dark soccer outside of new consoles well we

444
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:02,120
picked up a thing for um Dan's birthday that's a new console oh what but I'm not talking about it

445
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:09,800
yet okay I have a story about it later uh oh okay I know where this is going okay okay got it a

446
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:17,480
thing that ign ranked above the xbox and the playstation 5 okay I'm curious all right we'll

447
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:24,280
talk about that in a minute then yeah so I so I actually played some of it today uh again that

448
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:32,680
will come up later um I played a little bit of pinball um it's been kind of hard to play anything

449
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:37,160
else and playing animal crossing we just had our driveway done so it was really loud outside and I

450
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:42,120
could hardly hear anything and on top of that anytime I tried to play something that like would

451
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:48,840
get me excited um well my heart would start racing really badly and I would almost have

452
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:55,160
an asthma attack so I'm keeping it calm just keeping it calm lots of wordscapes and lots of

453
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,560
animal crossing and a little bit of pinball but you know it gets the heart racing a bit much

454
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:05,640
is it was basically coming off of the prednisone anything that I was playing that would kind of you

455
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:11,080
know kick me up into into overdrive would uh get my heart rate racing too fast because the

456
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:18,280
prednisone so now that I'm off of it I can play some stuff again so yay no scary games for a

457
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:23,560
little bit oh no scary games are fine because they don't really scare me it's just things that are

458
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:32,840
more like actiony you know okay so um but uh I've uh I've got a few few things coming up on my plate

459
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:38,360
and I'm finally once uh all of this is behind me I'm gonna do my charity stream

460
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:45,160
so you get to see uh I think that um dream daddy went out on my pole

461
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:54,040
so I'm gonna gonna get me a daddy let's see which daddy I go for might get myself a nice bear

462
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:59,640
oh it's not the first time I've heard that all right probably not from an ace girl

463
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,440
uh loki anything you wanted to add to your gaming week outside of the new stuff

464
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,560
um well just you know I did like I said I did play a little bit of Minecraft I played a lot

465
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:18,120
more Minecraft though on pc and I was working on our realm that um myself and my kids have so I was

466
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:25,080
finishing up this giant roller coaster with like tons of redstone stuff in it um so I finished up

467
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:30,680
the actual like coaster part of that still need to decorate it but it's our our giant um

468
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:36,520
creeper mine type roller coaster thing it's kind of fun because we actually have like a creeper in

469
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:40,200
a minecart that we have triggered to go at certain times so you see him like zoom by

470
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,360
if I have to add some more of that stuff in there have to probably shoot some video for it at some

471
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:51,000
point and then also uh my youngest son wanted me to play egg wards with him on one of the

472
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,080
Minecraft servers out there so I tried that today as well and unfortunately it's hard to play with

473
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:02,680
people that you don't know that there's no strategy or anything and no one's talking

474
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:07,640
and everybody's just kind of doing their own thing or just idling there so that was fun um

475
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:15,320
but yeah he was really excited about it so oh and Orna played more Orna yep that's about it yeah I

476
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:19,320
don't think I have a lot to add to my gaming week outside of the consoles except you know continuing

477
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:24,760
my uh my paladin in final fantasy 14 hit 80 so there's another class at 80. I will say to answer

478
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:30,680
act f's earlier question I have more jobs at max level in final fantasy 14 than I do playthroughs

479
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:35,480
of no man's sky if you want to know the game I really play too much of there's your answer there

480
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:39,320
but I also did a live stream of that earlier this week because I was like I haven't done a stream in

481
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:47,160
a long time um my some aspects of my mental health are actually improving um I can't imagine why um

482
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:51,800
but I was in a place where I felt like I could I could do a stream earlier this week so I did

483
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:58,200
um and uh yeah it felt pretty good I'll have to do more I I've been directly asked on twitter by

484
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:03,960
multiple people if I will do no man's sky on the xbox series x as a stream yes I just don't know

485
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:09,880
what night yet so um stay tuned for that on my personal channel at rob roberts um and then uh

486
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:17,080
you know kind of the gps stuff um I'm a little irritated with the niantic gps stuff but I'm

487
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,520
gonna save that for another week I want to I want to marinate on that and see how I feel in seven

488
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:27,560
days um but I have been playing orna still so that's um that's pretty good so yeah um I'm

489
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:32,680
looking for other suggestions of gps games that I haven't like I I thought I was on top of all of

490
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:37,400
them but I think there's some that I've missed out on so um I I was writing a tweet about that

491
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,960
so I'm kind of curious if I might discover anything new this week we'll see so uh yeah

492
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:46,600
act deaf to chat says that's true final fantasy 14 is the game you're always playing yes that is

493
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:51,800
very true but it's kind of the social element of that game for sure but a lot of people like for

494
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:56,440
some people call of duty is that game because they get online with their friends and play that game

495
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:01,400
for some people um destiny is that game because they get online or destiny 2 whatever get online

496
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,680
and play you know what I mean a lot of people have that kind of game that their friends get

497
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:10,360
together and play for some people um it's dungeons and dragons you know before the

498
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:14,680
pandemic people were getting together and playing dnd during the pandemic they're doing it on zoom

499
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:19,320
you know and other alternative board game types of things so there's always game night for something

500
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:23,400

with her on twitter you're a twitter person now you you weren't using the site very much at all

506
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:56,920
for a long time and now just in the past few months your twitter's been on fire I'm pretty

507
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:02,680
exclusive on it now I mean I need like this is a stupid ego thing but I really wish that I had

508
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:08,120
like the eight more followers to hit a thousand because I did ignore it for a while you know yeah

509
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:14,120
and now I've got two of them don't forget I have gen x geeks because of course my blog and which

510
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:20,440
my blog is actually I feel like it's starting to to do better I found my flow on it oh good so um

511
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:26,920
but but I mean yeah okay so you have two twitter accounts on your phone

512
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:32,920

513
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:39,800
I have one so I have my okay one two three four five six seven eight nine I have nine accounts

514
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:45,960
on my phone nine twitter accounts because yeah and no there's no after dark alt we're gonna rule

515
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:53,160
that out right now that is not one of them okay but I have me olr horde house I haven't used this

516
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:59,960
in 2014 uh my very secret day job twitter account that nobody knows about nobody's going to know

517
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:05,240
about that is not an invitation to go find it um because that is that is me separating day and

518
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:12,680
night stuff vog network guys on a show reading his fundamental podcast pokey stop podcast and shaking

519
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:16,840
and crying I have nine twitter accounts now granted I only use maybe three of those

520
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:23,720
with any regularity anymore but it's just funny so soon soon you'll have more of them because I mean

521
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:29,080
I made one for the sisters a long ass time ago I had like another personal one that

522
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:34,360
was going to be super private that I never used and I had lady 99 for a while when I was doing my

523
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:40,760
sort of uh protest stuff and I just said fuck it I'll just be public about my protesting gotcha

524
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,200
so I mean I've got I've got maybe about that many just that I've had for different purposes

525
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:53,800
and different organizations that I'm in but right now I'm focusing on those two because um I want

526
00:50:53,800 --> 00:51:01,080
to have something dedicated for my blog um and then um something that's just like my thing that

527
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:08,680
I can complain at everybody about and uh get overwhelmed with people posting about

528
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:15,480
chipping on supernatural I've noticed a lot of supernatural chat on your twitter this week but

529
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:20,360
I get it because the show I know is winding down and hey you know what Stacey Abrams is talking

530
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:25,560
about supernatural on her twitter so you're in good company oh yeah no that's cool she's been

531
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:32,520
getting some love from the cast uh as well um and I've actually been I've had a couple of just

532
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,520
little quick chats with with some of the some of the folks who do some good things I've actually

533
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:40,040
really started getting involved I know this is completely different started getting involved

534
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:48,120
with random acts.org um that uh some of the people who have been or associated with the cast um

535
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:53,080
organized for doing basically good charity work but also just encouraging everyone to be a little

536
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:59,160
kinder so be kind and run me a dnd game well I I have lots of kind things I could say about Stacey

537
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:03,800
Abrams I'm not even going to make it a political thing I mean yes I I love her politics but just

538
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:08,280
even outside of that and even if you are you know in a different political mind

539
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:14,440
spot I will say I love the fact that she is like an out nerd in politics and she's very you know

540
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:18,280
she talks about supernatural did you see that video where she was ranking all the star tracks

541
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:25,480
and she wasn't sitting there going well I always like she like she had her facts she's like I like

542
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:31,080
this one because of this story and what it does is I was like okay okay not not that anyone should

543
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:36,360
ever have to prove I wasn't top on there though I don't want to hear it ds9 was not top sorry

544
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:43,160
uh what did she put on top maybe she did no no she put voyager on top because I was like yes

545
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:49,320
yes me too I was like I that's another reason I love her she put voyager on top

546
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:55,720
voyager wasn't didn't deserve the bad rap that it got yeah I I still say deep space nine is the

547
00:52:55,720 --> 00:53:00,280
best of them all yeah but no I mean she she not and I was gonna say not that anyone should ever

548
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:07,240
have to prove her fandom but there is something extra special about the fact that she had like she

549
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:12,600
had deep answers anyway I'm sorry this isn't the Stacey Abrams fan club podcast I mean it could be

550
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:18,200
but it's uh it's OLR let's talk about other video games uh anything else for our gaming weeks I

551
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:23,320
think we got it all out let's then move on to some news there's been a lot that's been going on in

552
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:29,800
the news um about new consoles and other stuff as well right Loki uh yes so of course more

553
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,640
information coming out about the consoles and what they support and don't support

554
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:39,720
so one bit of um information that we have is right now the playstation 5 doesn't support

555
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:46,840
1440p resolutions so if you have a monitor that's 1440p well you're just gonna have to play it at

556
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:51,640
1080p instead um which is unfortunate because I know a lot of people that are getting high

557
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:57,560
refresh rate monitors may only be able to get 1440p like the one I got right now I was hoping

558
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:04,360
to get an hdmi 2.1 because that's what all these new consoles are um but there aren't any monitors

559
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:10,360
or hdmi 2.1 right now so that's basically what you need to be able to do 120 frames per second

560
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:19,880
and 4k at the same time so now I can only do 4k and 60 fps or I could do 1440p at 120 so that's

561
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:26,040
kind of what I'm sticking with at least on the Xbox side but the Xbox series x does support 1440p

562
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:33,400
so that's always good um now whether that may be coming to the playstation 5 later possibly because

563
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:41,640
right now according to the VP of platform management uh Hideki Nishino basically said that

564
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:47,240
they wanted to prioritize tv support that's why that 1440p isn't currently supported because

565
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:55,800
that's mainly a monitor format and not a tv um but later on there's um no reason no technical reasons

566
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:01,240
to be able to support that later on so that may be something that's coming if demand um requires

567
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:08,360
it to um along with that there are some issues with some of the games that are backwards

568
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:14,760
compatible that may have um problems playing now we talked about last week how there are some of

569
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:22,760
the assassins creed games that were not being supported 100 and actually one of those assassins

570
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:28,840
creed syndicate I believe is one of those that does have an issue playing it does actually run

571
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:36,280
but their shadows are kind of like strobing a bit it's all glitched out but up the 4000 plus titles

572
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:44,200
that are backwards compatible they said about 115 of those are tagged as um you may experience game

573
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:49,160
behavior or unexpected game behavior while playing this playstation 4 game on your ps5 console

574
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:54,120
so is that why ubisoft had it remember that story a couple weeks ago and we were like

575
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:58,280
maybe ubisoft wasn't running the same version emulator at least that was my theory and ubisoft

576
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:02,680
outed all these games it's not backwards compatible and they pulled it so it sounds

577
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:09,480
like there may have been some like a truthiness in that because okay assassins creed is backwards

578
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:15,640
compatible but or syndicate specifically is backwards compatible but it's got some flaws

579
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:21,560
yeah like for example they talked about some of the other um annoyances that you may run into grip

580
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:28,200
for example you can um it says that there's issues but nothing's really been noticeable

581
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:34,040
everybody's golf there's some flick you're a flickering scenery graphics mainly the trees

582
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:39,960
it could be like how that stuff is being rendered and certain engines um and emulators even going

583
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:46,120
back to like nes emulators have had this issue like um i remember castlevania 3

584
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:52,360
the vertical scrolling levels were the biggest pain to get emulated for the longest time

585
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:57,560
because they're the way those were being kind of like done was very different and the emulators

586
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:02,520
didn't know how to do it so if you tried to play castlevania 3 early on back in my day in the nes

587
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:07,640
emulator days this was college so yes i was using emulators and playing all sorts of stuff in them

588
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:12,760
um but like you couldn't get past you know the like second part of the first level of

589
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,720
castlevania 3 because it was a vertical scrolling part anyway just it's just emulators have always

590
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:22,440
had these problems because they're emulating they're not perfectly the hardware right so

591
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:28,200
just you know um keep in mind that you know you may run into some issues they have a backwards

592
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:34,760
compatibility page that talks about um some of the issues that you may run into but you know it's

593
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:40,600
it's not to say that they are always going to be broken it could be that they fix them down the

594
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:47,000
line but at launch i mean four thousand out of you know um and only having like a hundred of

595
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:59,800
those kind of broken that's not bad so um yeah and then on top of that though um i i don't know if

596
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:05,160
anyone's really asked the question about region locking but apparently the playstation 5 games

597
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:10,200
are also going to be region free which i believe it was the same with the playstation 4 i i'm kind

598
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:17,880
of glad that we've moved past the whole region locking with video games um so hopefully that

599
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:25,720
stays the same but yeah apparently it is been confirmed via their faq's that yes it is still

600
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:33,640
region free so that's good i would assume though the same might not be able to be said about

601
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:41,160
uh all uh placey or i should say uh 4k blu-rays i'm not sure if those are still region locked

602
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:44,600
but at least the games themselves are not

603
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:57,400
hmm how where so i mean region locking thing thing of the past right well yeah we haven't

604
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:06,040
really seen it since uh the playstation 3 i think um on sony side yes nintendo

605
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:13,480
i think 3d wasn't 3ds or ds i feel like it was more recent on the xbox no the xbox 360 was

606
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:21,400
region locked the playstation 3 i cannot remember if that was region locked the thing maybe there

607
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:27,160
might have been some games that were some that weren't um nintendo side i want to say

608
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:36,840
probably the wii u i know that their cartridge games weren't but i don't know if the wii u discs

609
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:45,960
were region locked um obviously i don't think the switch games are but i know 3ds and nintendo ds

610
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:54,760
games were not locked all right well um let's move on then and let's oh actually let me get

611
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:59,320
some quick chat messages here because uh bobby blackwolf says uh note that there's no dolby

612
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:05,000
vision or atmos in playstation 5 and there never will be it seems um he does say it going to say

613
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,960
though that 4k uhd blu-rays will pass through fine if you turn on bitstream audio output in

614
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:14,920
the dvd player settings menu and that has to do with a like a licensing thing for that technology

615
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:21,080
probably right i'm assuming well yeah because i know with atmos like i have my headphones i'm

616
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:30,280
wearing right now actually are adobe atmos um and i had to download the app because i had to do that

617
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:37,640
on pc as well i download the app um and put in a serial number that i got with my headphones

618
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:44,760
to be able to use the atmos part of that or the seven one surround sound um but yeah i did the

619
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:49,400
same thing on the series x thankfully it worked without having any troubles like because i was

620
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:54,920
like oh no enter a serial number i don't have that anymore um but thankfully because i purchased it

621
01:00:54,920 --> 01:01:03,000
on pc that it remembered it all right well moving on let's talk about something that was all over

622
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,760
social media earlier this week when it was happening because this was unfortunately one

623
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:11,320
of those things that was kind of playing out live um and you know that can be both a good thing and

624
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:17,160
a bad thing um good because you can follow along but bad because a lot of stuff kind of gets thrown

625
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:22,120
in that isn't necessarily true and that is the situation that happened with ubisoft montreal

626
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:29,160
earlier this week um a couple days ago uh in the afternoon uh there was a really scary situation

627
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:34,120
that happened there um that uh there was talk on social media about oh my gosh there's like an

628
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:38,760
armed gunman that went into the building and was shooting and all of this well yes and that's the

629
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,640
part that social media thankfully got incorrect apparently that was the type of thing that had

630
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:48,600
been called in however the whole thing if you hadn't heard by this point it ended up being a

631
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:54,600
fake 911 call that triggered all these events that happened on friday um so there was a bunch

632
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:58,200
of stuff that was uploaded to twitter and that's why all this kind of like you know talk about what

633
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:04,440
was going on um had happened from um so yeah some folks had been working from home because uh you

634
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:09,080
know the pandemic some were still in the office so some people were tweeting like i know those

635
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:15,080
people on the roof because those are you know my co-workers and stuff um it was it was unfortunately

636
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:21,000
a fake 911 call that appears to be some type of swatting event um that happened which definitely

637
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:26,680
just makes us go like uh it's just it's kind of just disgusting that these swatting events still

638
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:34,840
happen um you know and why was ubisoft montreal targeted um it is very easy to tie that to gaming

639
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:39,960
culture because we've seen the swatting thing happen with you know twitch streams and and

640
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:46,840
things of that sort um and you know it's it's i i shouldn't make that assumption that it's because

641
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:51,400
they're a gaming company and somebody was upset about games that they did this unfortunately

642
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:59,320
track record kind of makes that a safe assumption that it probably was some type of weird

643
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:05,320
somebody trying to prove a point um and you might look at this and go well nobody was hurt

644
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:09,720
um uh do you know the psychological trauma this type of shit can put on people

645
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:14,840
seriously like read the accounts of some people who have gone through this on their social media

646
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:20,360
and stuff like this um there was definitely damage done so this is not an ever oh nobody got hurt

647
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:25,400
hahaha type of situation um when you do this type of swatting stuff i i know i appreciate the choir

648
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:29,320
here with this audience and you guys that are tuning in here are decent enough to know this

649
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:35,400
but i'm gonna say it anyway um you know when you're doing that swatting stuff to you know

650
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,480
haha get a rise out of people you are hurting you're intending to hurt and harm people

651
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:45,240
and it's about time that the law really caught up with that and had some really severe punishments

652
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:52,360
um on a on a on a national or at least state level scale um of how that's dealt with now

653
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:57,720
because i'm sure somebody will jump in there and say oh this happened in canada um

654
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:04,680
again i don't i don't know how to eloquently phrase this um but if i am to make any sort of

655
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:10,200
lemonade out of the the lemons that is this news the fact that it happened in canada makes me go

656
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:15,240
well maybe somebody will do something about this swatting thing now you know maybe something will

657
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:20,200
happen from the canadian government to really take a look at this issue how it happened why

658
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:26,760
it happened and look at never making it happen again and then hopefully the u.s can you know

659
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:31,560
use it as a blueprint and other countries too we don't want to just you know focus on north america

660
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:38,280
but this this swatting shit is dangerous and it has to stop um and um yeah i don't know what

661
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:45,800
else to say about that anybody want to add to that i can go to our chat too um act efton chat says uh

662
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:50,600
we know that ubisoft isn't the best company out there but this shouldn't happen to anyone at all

663
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:57,480
yeah no the the reputation and all that stuff if if this had happened to ea comcast

664
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:02,040
whatever like worst company you can think of i would say the exact same thing this is unacceptable

665
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:08,200
period um no one special 77 says plus since the police were tied up in a fake call that was fewer

666
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:12,440
cops that were unavailable for a legit call and in a legit situation where cops weren't there

667
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:18,600
folks could have been easily hurt um you know say a car accident had happened where people were

668
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:23,480
seriously injured somewhere you know you're right that takes police away from the availability to

669
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:32,040
do something like that um so it's um it's gross pod culture says even evil g even evil g absolutely

670
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:40,440
anybody anybody meant anybody so anyway it's an attempt for a party to show power over another

671
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:47,880
party and really it's not just for the recipient um you know who is uh definitely going to be

672
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:53,800
suffering um you know trauma from this but the person themselves it's indicative of serious uh

673
01:05:53,800 --> 01:06:00,200
mental health problems that need to be addressed and people have died from it yeah oh yeah oh yeah

674
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:04,760
yeah we heard about the guy that got shot it was horrible it was like the neighbor or something i

675
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:10,840
don't know but it was it was horrible i'm sure that wasn't the only one it's so anyway sorry

676
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:16,200
i don't mean to drag things down i mean at least we can say okay at least it wasn't a shooting

677
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:22,040
situation but it's it's not really honest is it it's not right down yeah it's not really good news

678
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:30,280
so anyway not all news is good it doesn't have to be yeah so the the news doesn't care how it

679
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:35,720
makes you feel it's true the news is news just like science is science no matter what you believe

680
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:42,360
that's true so i'm gonna i'm gonna hope this had nothing to do with gaming culture but i'm gonna

681
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:50,040
know in the back of my mind i'm wrong and it is so anyway we'll see we'll see let's move on how

682
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:54,520
about something that is good news dark soccer how about something a little more light-hearted well

683
01:06:54,520 --> 01:07:00,200
this is what i was referring to earlier um my husband's birthday is coming up a couple of days

684
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:06,920
after thanksgiving um we often have to deal with this and i've been racking my brain what am i

685
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:10,760
gonna get him what am i gonna get him and he's like i found myself something and i bought it

686
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:21,160
for myself from you for my birthday okay thanks oops so we have the uh the game and watch handheld

687
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:31,400
the new one um it is basically um in the semblance of the old game and watch it actually isn't

688
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:38,360
doesn't feel as as hefty as an old game and watch you know um but it's got like the color scheme

689
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:49,480
the branding and everything on it but it comes with um a uh uh built-in uh uh lcd screen um

690
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:55,080
that uh hat that will play three different games uh one of them is of course super mario brothers

691
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:59,080
um i had to get i had to like re-familiarize myself with the controller because it feels

692
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:03,400
different than playing it with the nes controller um and then there's super mario brothers 2 which

693
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:08,440
as we know it is lost levels which is basically the i bet you want to cry while playing mario

694
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:17,640
the game um and then the um uh there's ball you remember ball it was i believe the first game and

695
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:25,720
watch game um that uh i don't know i said lcd going back it was the the juggling game with

696
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:29,480
the balls but this time it's got mario's face on it although honestly it looks more like luigi but

697
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:33,880
does it the way they have like the little plates or something like that it's kind of moving back

698
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:37,960
and forth and the different okay it's just little balls and you get them from hand to hand yeah

699
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:42,520
well to be to be honest it is one of the easter eggs but there is a way to get luigi and ball

700
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:49,320
anyway yeah there there's actually video now that shows uh every one of the easter eggs including

701
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:57,000
the uh the image galleries and uh uh the oshi screen and how to you know get a warp pipe and

702
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:02,360
everything and the bowser fights um but at any rate because it is a game and watch it also has

703
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:09,160
the clock built in and the clock has different uh super mario brothers uh scenery uh playing through

704
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:15,720
it i don't know why why is then i'm just sorry i got like a little tongue tied for a moment

705
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:21,080
but basically um you know the time gives you the super mario theme clock and it kind of ticks along

706
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:27,720
with it um and it changes from day to night um with the with the you know with the hours

707
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:34,280
um and is that something that's kind of just meant to be running like on your shelf full time

708
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:39,720
since they have like the clock thing okay well was your was your game and watch meant to run

709
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:46,760
all the time no but it's been 30 years yeah but the with the game and watch is you know if you

710
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:53,160
didn't have a watch with you you could use the watch on your game and watch

711
01:09:54,360 --> 01:10:03,480
oh okay i see the game and a watch but at any rate um you know i'm going to say this you know

712
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:10,680
it's it's it's neat you know it actually is a fun little nod it's definitely a novelty sort of thing

713
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:17,160
um and i still thought it was hilarious that ign ranked it higher than the uh

714
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:23,800
than the ps5 and the xbox um why did they do that besides for clicks why what was their

715
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:31,640
what was their justification in that i think fun factor okay yeah but at any at any rate you know

716
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:36,520
it's a really cool little thing it's got some nods you can look at it you know it's it's fun

717
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:41,240
you can play super mario brothers the screen is bigger than the gameboy micro so i mean hey

718
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:49,880
um it honestly though and this is just me um maybe it felt like it was

719
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:57,400
that was a good word for it i guess not super hefty does that make sense yeah like it felt

720
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:05,640
really lightweight i'm not gonna say cheap but it did feel really lightweight and the uh

721
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:12,760
you know the the buttons were you know light everything was just light about it um and and

722
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:18,360
i mean it is pretty much a a gimmick it's a fun gimmick but honestly i kind of want one of those

723
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:23,640
little game gears more than this but dan wanted this and dan got this and it's his birthday so

724
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:29,640
what i want doesn't matter um but i think it is uh pretty pretty cool i'm waiting to see what

725
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:34,440
the hackers do to it you know it's funny you bring that up because bob coffee and chat says

726
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:38,920
it'll be interesting to see if someone hacks it to play other nes games my understanding is and

727
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:43,560
i said it already was yeah i was gonna say i think i saw this on our discord over at vog

728
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:49,240
network.com slash discord i think that's where i saw it um somebody had um posted that it already

729
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:55,320
has been somebody got the like a hacked mario rom on there that actually will show the message hacked

730
01:11:56,280 --> 01:12:02,520
so um it's happening i wasn't even looking at chat until you said that bob coffee said something

731
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:09,640
yeah but um but i mean um it's it's a really neat little thing you know i'm glad i'm glad we have it

732
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:17,000
you know it's it's really cute and it's definitely you know we're we're sort of stuck in our hardcore

733
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:22,120
nintendo uh fandomism right now you know i mean dan just the other day says i don't want another

734
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:28,600
system that isn't a nintendo system i'm like oh yeah same kind of right now but and so he

735
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:35,080
was right the next system he bought was a nintendo system a little gimmicky tiny nintendo system but

736
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:40,280
it's cute and it's great and it's a little fun thing and it was kind of fun playing super mario

737
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:44,440
brothers on a game and watch you know even though it's not quite the same size as an old game and

738
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:51,160
watch but um but yeah that's cool and you know if you want you know just something kind of fun to

739
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:57,880
have on the go with a little nostalgia i mean you could do worse yeah i have to admit i totally

740
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:02,600
forgot that that thing was even coming out with you know all the hysteria around the new consoles

741
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:07,000
and trying to order them until i saw like a couple of people on twitter were posting their pictures

742
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,320
in the box saying look what i got instead and this is kind of like the same type of thing i'm like oh

743
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:18,280
yeah nintendo was launching a console this week too uh i'll put a picture on my twitter but um

744
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:22,680
yeah i mean in in all kidding aside about nintendo's big console entry into the next

745
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:27,720
generation uh i obviously the switch is still gonna sell like crazy this this holiday because

746
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:32,920
not only is it the switch but it's got a pretty robust library of games so there's still going

747
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:37,160
to be an audience of people that you're going to want to play things like uh breath of the wild

748
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:42,200
mario kart and so forth and now of course the mario kart live as we've seen is is going to

749
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:47,400
probably be a big toy that a lot of kids want and so forth so um yeah and then the game and watch

750
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:52,360
is a nice little entry to the collectibles um kind of interesting to see that that's where nintendo

751
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:58,600
is going from the nes classic and the snes classic everybody was like where's the 64

752
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:03,080
classic or the game boy classic well we got a game and watch classic which maybe isn't

753
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:09,080
on the top of people's lists but it's maybe something to hold us over for another year or

754
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:14,760
two until one of those other things we talked about are going so thinking that they're really

755
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:22,600
trying to use that nostalgia to bank of course it's almost like and maybe i'm a little bit off

756
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:26,920
base on this one but i'm wondering if it's sort of like nintendo's fundraising right now

757
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:35,080
um well no we just i i think our show got cut off right before this story came up last week but we

758
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:39,480
did have a story on the list about how the switch no i think you might have got to it i don't

759
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:46,360
remember but there was a story about how the switch has outsold the nes already yeah we we

760
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:51,960
were about to get cut off so i just threw it in okay yeah so um that that whole thing was was

761
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:57,480
there so the switch is still selling like crazy so i don't think they need to fundraise but certainly

762
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:02,840
there's going to be the question of well we are a publicly traded company how can we make our

763
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:10,040
investors more money and that's the answer more money if if they did a kirby one i would buy it

764
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:17,560
they'd have to have like a lot of kirby games on it i just want the the the game in kirby um tiger

765
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:21,560
claw and chat says you think they'll do another game and watch of another game um and orange

766
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:25,640
right echoes the kirby answer but also says i think they're definitely going to make more game

767
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:31,800
and watches isn't a major zelda anniversary coming up yes i believe next year would be 30

768
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:36,760
because this year is 35 for mario right so next year's 35 for zelda or something like that i could

769
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:42,680
i could be off but um i i think uh yeah zelda's zelda's coming up and i wouldn't i wouldn't be

770
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:47,400
surprised though honestly you know what they want to release for zelda's 35th anniversary

771
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:53,160
breath of the wild 2 that's probably going to be next holiday's game and i i think

772
01:15:53,160 --> 01:16:00,680
that that's plenty big enough of a zelda anniversary treat so yeah all right well

773
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:06,360
anyhow let's move on we have more stories and uh loki a big one in gaming culture right now right

774
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:14,120
oh yes fun times when we when we're talking about the um the rights of music industry

775
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:21,720
or music holders so the ria and mpa um so anyways twitch you may remember they had

776
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:30,040
a whole dmca fiasco where they were um taking down people's channels um because they had

777
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:37,080
you know copyrighted music in their clips and of course they had really terrible tools for um not

778
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:43,480
even necessarily identifying which you know video you may have had that had that but basically kind

779
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:50,520
of like this nuclear delete everything option was one of the ways to go or you know you could

780
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:56,920
possibly face you know copyright strikes and your channel being deleted so it's really it was only

781
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:03,640
like a mass deletion tool and they only really gave folks you know a few days notice about that

782
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:11,080
so of course they came out and apologized you know saying you know it's basically you know we

783
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:16,280
understand that you're rightly upset with the only option we provided was a mass deletion tool for

784
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:20,360
clips and that we only gave you three days notice to use this tool we could have developed more

785
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:28,680
sophisticated user-friendly tools a while ago that we didn't is on us yeah no kidding you think you

786
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:34,440
live in the same universe that youtube's in you see all the stories about how you know all the

787
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:40,200
copyright stuff they have to go through and you thought that sucks for them and not thinking at

788
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:46,680
all about your own company it's kind of stupid and so of course they said it that was a mistake

789
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:51,480
is or um and we could have provided creators with a longer time period to address their vod and clip

790
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:55,960
libraries that was a miss as well we're truly sorry for these mistakes and we'll do better

791
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:00,760
except you know they're not because that's never going to be the case it's never going to be the

792
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:06,840
end so of course what's going on now well the same stuff you normally see on youtube so for example

793
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:15,800
there was um someone by the name of um makal ronan who said that they had only music they've

794
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:22,360
had on their streams was in-game world of warcraft music played by the game itself yet they've got

795
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:30,680
muted audio on their latest vod because apparently in senjin village um there is the copyrighted

796
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:37,640
music banger called medium windstorm with gus whistles and low rumble from sound effects from

797
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:42,440
hollywood edge sound effects library first off i don't think that those should ever be part of the

798
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:52,440
copyright dmca you know system anyways it's sound effects especially if well okay i i i don't want

799
01:18:52,440 --> 01:19:00,200
to spoil but i have to say there is another story in the news this week that is exactly this

800
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:05,640
and for the record sound effects actually do require a bit of engineering and design

801
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:11,400
so yes it is somebody's intellectual property yeah i i can't support it's it's a weird thing

802
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:15,400
i i don't think i can support the fact that you know the sound effects people shouldn't be

803
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:22,200
entitled to their thing but but if it's like i i feel like if it's already in the umbrella of

804
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:28,200
the game that you license especially when the game has said we do not care if you broadcast our game

805
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:33,400
then at some point there's got to be a happy medium there where the streamer is absolved of

806
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:37,400
those incidental sound effects that have happened in the background now if a streamer brings in

807
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:41,960
their own sound board and their own sound effects and starts playing that stuff different that's

808
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:46,440
different and absolutely i think that's fine because and this is why honestly like i'm gonna

809
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:51,880
be honest and this isn't what you guys want to hear but i have always been like i'm not gonna

810
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:57,000
play spotify in the background of my streams and i i i i'll watch streams where people do it and

811
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,800
i don't care what other people do but i feel like y'all are on borrowed time like they're gonna come

812
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:07,800
in and stop that and sure enough here we are and people are like what i couldn't play spotify about

813
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:13,480
i couldn't play i couldn't play Madonna while i was playing my games no like i felt like that

814
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:19,880
whole stuff was on borrowed time well however i do think that if the game says you can stream us

815
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:24,920
online then this stuff is in the game and it makes that stuff like guitar hero and music based games

816
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:31,400
in this really weird gray area i get it but i i'm not surprised at the music part of it the sound

817
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:37,800
effect stuff gets a little bit tricky and we've seen on youtube where this gets abused so i also

818
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:42,680
because i don't want to see us make it sound like oh i agree in every single instance no no there's

819
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:48,520
cases where somebody is you know in some third party comes in and sound matches that this happened

820
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:54,440
to one of my youtube videos and um i contested it and it took forever but it was one of those things

821
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:58,600
where it's the principle of the thing you know right i feel like there has to be a way to strike

822
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:04,680
back against incorrect claims well i've seen i've seen some where they've actually there's been a

823
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:09,880
guy whispering or something like that was the clip they made it a private clip and it got copyright

824
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:16,440
claimed for something he's like dude that was my own voice like yeah i don't understand that's why

825
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:19,960
when i'm getting ready to start doing mine i'm going to be doing all the music myself

826
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:26,920
and with my own copyright uh notice on on my youtube channel well that's what's funny it's

827
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:32,600
like there was a thing i saw a video talking about like the copyright system and youtube and stuff

828
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:38,840
and apparently the way someone's gotten around is they make a really terrible and you well not

829
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:46,200
necessarily terrible but like a really unique intro or extro song or outro song and you copy

830
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:52,440
you actually submit that to one of those copyright claim um companies that will actually go out there

831
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:58,360
and flag that and so all of your videos are technically copyright claimed by yourself so

832
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:05,000
it's like huh they can't two companies can't claim the same video allegedly or like it the way the

833
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:10,360
money system works it doesn't allow it to flag it or something like that but basically it would

834
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:17,400
it's not demonetizing and actually this works also for allegedly um monetizing unmonetizable

835
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:22,680
things because you're basically a copyright claiming yourself so you're kind of abusing the

836
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:28,840
system i don't feel so bad for the system to be honest considering how broken it is but that is

837
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:34,040
one way around it that you could do um which i thought was interesting uh also the copyright

838
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:41,000
deadlock that uh jim sterling of course uh famously created was pretty funny uh where two

839
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:46,920
companies fight over the copyright claim for one video and technically two different companies

840
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:52,040
can't claim the same content because no one is the owner then you can't say it's my content and then

841
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:57,720
the other company says oh but that's my content as well it doesn't work that way um the the

842
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:04,440
government is going to have to step in and fix this and modernize these rules and um you know i

843
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:08,040
i don't think that necessarily suddenly happens just because we're going to have a change in the

844
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:12,040
administration because you know there's just there's so many other things i think they're

845
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:17,400
they're looking at and so forth however i will say this one thing we talked about at length a

846
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:23,080
couple weeks ago was the whole like alexandria ocasio-cortez got into live streaming and was

847
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:27,960
doing that among us stream that essentially became a huge like political awareness rally

848
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:33,240
that happened on twitch right and there were other people from other political parties watching that

849
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:38,200
like justin amash who wanted to kind of leverage something like that for himself and so on and so

850
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:45,000
on so i think as you start to see more politicians get into this just wait wait for the day that aoc

851
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:50,520
gets a copyright strike on one of her things that's what it's gonna take the whole copyright

852
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:56,360
system needs to be like redone it's just been abused the hell by disney and other companies

853
01:23:56,360 --> 01:24:05,320
ria it they have like these i mean they really should be accounting for fair use um like for

854
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:09,880
example one of the examples of another music thing that was taken down was a cover of a song

855
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:15,640
that someone was covering and they they copyright strike it for the original or um someone using

856
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:20,760
like a five second clip to make a remix or something like that or five second clip of a song

857
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:27,000
for some sort of you know uh comedic effect or something and it gets the whole video gets

858
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:35,640
copyrighted for a five second clip that just seems ridiculous um phoenix 7726 says they won't in the

859
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:41,160
same way twitter never banned trump they can see that coming a mile away except well this when

860
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:46,280
they're running bots and automated shit wait until one of them gets caught up in it like the

861
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:51,000
twitter situation's very different because twitter has had to put a flag on the account that basically

862
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:57,480
says you know never never disable or ban this although somebody did remember that yeah for like

863
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:02,200
three hours well it's just temporarily and it's feeling because it's you know an official channel

864
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:07,400
well not really supposed to be an official channel but it's basically it's a government um

865
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:14,280
communication media or something like that now oh so could the army recruitment twitch get struck

866
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:23,240
um well no because see basically like for example they can't ban people from their channels because

867
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:28,760
it's it's technically like a government entity uh no i'm saying if they play the wrong game could

868
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:35,640
the army get a copyright strike i don't know that's i'm telling you do you really want to

869
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:43,960
anger the army i mean that that's how this and i in in a way i kind of do hope it happens and

870
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:48,840
not in the way you think i'm saying that i'm helping it happens because that is what's going

871
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:53,720
to get the government to move on this stuff and you know modernize the the copyright law and all

872
01:25:53,720 --> 01:26:00,680
that stuff so anyway all right but we can't fix copyright law tonight on our uh but just be

873
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:07,000
careful on twitch um i i i don't know what else to say about that um the sound effect thing is

874
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:12,680
really scary and i because you know you don't know what games you thought the the creators

875
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:17,160
are totally cool with you playing on stream and then it's like gotcha you know it's that part's

876
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:24,840
a little bit scary i i that doesn't make any sense it doesn't i i get it like it just seems like a

877
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:30,520
stretch like you know like if you're licensing sound effects like that you you know that you're

878
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:38,120
dealing with certain types of clientele it's not like i don't see how it's wind sounds so obviously

879
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:45,000
you know an ai is not gonna it it's not gonna know if that exactly matches that like i i don't know i

880
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:51,080
just feel like it makes mistakes and even like i've seen stuff you know on youtube for example

881
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:54,680
where they're just filming something outside in the park and it gets copyrighted claim for the

882
01:26:54,680 --> 01:27:01,080
wind sounds it's like dude like yeah it's too much too much they're there there needs to be

883
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:06,600
and honestly the my idea you know i'm not a politician my idea is and i've been saying this

884
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:12,040
since the very beginning there needs to be a way to have an effective counter claim where the

885
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:17,880
claimant gets striped so that if they are filing too many claims and they do it overdo it too many

886
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:23,800
times they lose the ability to be able to do it or that's what needs to be in there or better yet

887
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:29,880
that they should basically if you're claiming something you can only claim the section of the

888
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:35,480
video that it's in so if i play a five second clip you're not claiming the whole video you're claiming

889
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:42,120
the five second portion of that video and right now even with youtube and sometimes youtube is a

890
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:46,920
little more specific about what it is that someone's claiming a lot of times those claims

891
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:51,640
could be it's supposed to be specific like this is the section where there's the offending material

892
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:56,520
but it's not a lot of times they're missing that and that is i think something that's supposed to

893
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:01,160
be important about the dmca there's it's supposed to those strikes are supposed to include that and

894
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:05,640
they're also supposed to consider fair use but because these corporations know that

895
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:13,160
there's nothing that you're going to be able to do they you know they don't necessarily have to

896
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:18,280
use fair use i mean we've seen people use dmca strikes to take down vias they just don't like

897
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:24,200
yeah you know yeah and use it as an excuse so it's it's a broken system all right well let me move on

898
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:28,360
i'm gonna get to our next story because i don't want the show to go all night but um let's talk

899
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:33,720
about a bunch of money changing hands somewhere else and that is because take two who of course

900
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:37,800
is the publisher behind you know grand theft auto borderlands you might have heard of them i think

901
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:45,160
loki's a little bit of a fan um take two has acquired code masters code masters of course

902
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:50,600
is a big company out of britain uh that makes a lot of like racing games i believe dirt five is

903
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:56,040
kind of their latest and greatest big title um so uh yeah they're gonna uh join the other labels

904
01:28:56,040 --> 01:29:01,800
that take two oversees like 2k games which is you know like the the 2k sports and the civilization

905
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:07,000
and all that rock star games uh and private division so code masters is going to be there

906
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:12,120
uh no words yet as to is there going to be any restructuring or any moving around and things

907
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:19,560
like that um but uh in a comment uh to business wire the boss at take two straus zelnick said

908
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:24,040
that the racing output the code master does is going to fit well with the publishing giant's

909
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:29,480
existing sports fair um and then code masters will benefit from the distribution and marketing at

910
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:34,920
take two so it does kind of sound like it could be a mutually beneficial situation and i don't

911
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:39,320
really see that like these games are going to go anywhere they're going to suddenly put code masters

912
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:47,000
on like a different type of game but i mean we'll see what happens well you know it is take two

913
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:53,240
let's not let's not confuse things i like rockstar games i don't necessarily like take two okay two

914
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:59,560
is just about as bad as ea and activision they are going to monetize the crap out of this stuff

915
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:05,160
um well good for code masters at least you know that's a little bit more exposure i guess for

916
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:14,680
their games but it's just going to be a mess i mean just look at wwe and you know mba 2k

917
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:19,400
to get an idea of what take two likes to do with their franchises i mean so it's

918
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:27,720
uh best of luck to them all right good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor all right

919
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:31,080
moving on on a different note dar sakura

920
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:41,800
well you know i like to talk about um video games being used for for good um and cambridge uh the

921
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:50,920
cambridge researchers um actually put together a um a game that's supposed to help people online

922
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:59,160
learn how to debunk uh fake news i hate using the term fake news but meant to debunk disinformation

923
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:06,760
um how to recognize uh you know legitimate information versus misinformation um game is

924
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:18,040
called harmony square and it's just a simple web game um you basically are uh shown a a news story

925
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:25,960
um it it has like four different decision-based chapters to help you master these different

926
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:35,160
techniques um on how to spread fake news and troll and then you will can you will master those

927
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:42,680
techniques and learn then what it is that's prompting people to believe these things and

928
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:49,880
for you to evaluate your own feelings and your own triggers to make yourself think more critically

929
01:31:49,880 --> 01:32:00,200
and it actually works um they tested it with 700 participants and then um you know they had them

930
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:07,640
rate headlines and social media posts prior to this um and then they had half of them play

931
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:14,200
harmony square and they have a half to play tetris and after it was huh no i'm just laughing

932
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:20,920
giggling at the the control group in that case and so they they had them do it again with different

933
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:27,000
headlines and then with their conclusion um that i'm going to quote the perceived reliability of

934
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:34,520
misinformation of the participants who played harmony square reduced to 16 um and their

935
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:42,440
willingness to share those things reduced by 11 and and even so i mean that's you know saying

936
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:49,320
that if that with that population split down the middle um 63 of that half that played it would

937
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:55,080
find misinformation significantly less reliable this is actually from the report um compared to

938
01:32:55,080 --> 01:33:01,240
237 of the left half to navigate online information without the inoculation of harmony square

939
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:10,360
and you can um go to harmony square dot game and try it for yourself interesting and i'm

940
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:14,360
sorry i might have missed it at the beginning is this is this a game for kids or adults or like

941
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:20,040
all ages everybody okay it's just i i you know when i hear something like this i'm kind of like

942
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:24,680
this is the type of stuff i hope they're teaching kids in like high school or junior high you know

943
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:30,840
this is this is stuff like unfortunately that's where our society has evolved and um i know we

944
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:35,000
were playing things like oregon trail and number munchers and math blasters and stuff when we were

945
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:39,880
younger and i think there's still room for games like that um but like this is the type of thing

946
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:44,840
i hope they're using in school because unfortunately in this day and age uh that is not a skill that

947
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:50,040
is learned by everybody is how to not fall for bullshit uh and there's a lot of bullshit on

948
01:33:50,040 --> 01:34:00,360
facebook and insert social media platform here so some yeah um no one special 77 in chat makes

949
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:05,320
a little joke saying cambridge needs to make 13 games to teach folks how to point out clickbait

950
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:10,920
articles game number seven will surprise you that's that's pretty good no one special in

951
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:14,520
in your uh history of joke making here on this program that's that's one of the better ones

952
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:22,440
so kudos to you all right but i i i i do love and dark soccer i'm glad you brought that story up

953
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:29,240
because i do love that idea of gamification or gamifying and gamification of a topic uh we need

954
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:34,280
to be educating more about and talking about for sure so whether whether whatever term you want to

955
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:40,840
use for it you know bullshit on social media is something we need to as a society get stronger in

956
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:51,080
dealing with so the the other thing too is that i i think of it like this that maybe it's a little

957
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:59,960
bit sad that we have to use a game to teach because people won't by themselves educate

958
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:05,480
themselves does that make sense people don't want to be educated they want to be entertained right

959
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:14,520
and that is honestly a social disease um since i have i think no well i'll just say since i've

960
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:20,440
done a lot with educating over the years i can see how games can sometimes work as an application

961
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:24,600
method because you know some people are going to learn by listening to the lecture some people are

962
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:28,760
going to learn by visually but with pretty charts and graphs or reading in a book something with

963
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:34,840
their eyes but a lot of people learn by doing and i kind of feel like games i mean yes they're games

964
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:39,800
but they're a way to learn by doing um especially when it comes to things that are more like soft

965
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:46,120
skills as opposed to put widget a on top of widget b you know in that type of application

966
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:53,160
like a game of this sort can be an application of it when you present a game with the purpose

967
01:35:53,160 --> 01:36:01,400
of educating covertly people aren't going into it expecting to learn something but when you are in

968
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:07,960
you know a classroom environment and you're doing supplemental you know exercises or games people

969
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:13,640
are there knowing that they're there to learn and that this is i'll be honest i hate in class games

970
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:20,200
i just want you to give me the information let me learn it let me go um you know it is so funny

971
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:24,520
because all of my trainers where i work know this about me now and they're just like did you already

972
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:31,880
finish the modules like i finished all the days modules can i can i finish um but uh but back to

973
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:37,720
that you know it's some people do need it but when they know that they're being educated it's

974
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:44,280
a different thing if it is a game presented hey play this it's fun and then they learn something

975
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:51,400
from it that it's not what they think the primary purpose of it is then and you know if you if you

976
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:58,440
like hey this thing is is a problem and we need to learn how not to do it if you give that to them

977
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:04,840
they're gonna be like i guess i don't care versus hey here's this game to play oh wow i learned

978
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:09,640
something from this game i didn't expect it to happen you know what i mean yeah that's a

979
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:15,560
completely different thing like yeah i i am by the way i'm alert by doing myself i just hate those

980
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:20,440
exercises because i know that that's all it is i would rather you just give me the information and

981
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:25,320
let me figure it out i get the perspective of the i might pleasantly learn something while playing

982
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:29,160
a game like take a game like civilization you might actually learn something about history and

983
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:35,240
world leaders playing that game but that's not not why you signed up to play does that make sense so

984
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:39,720
yeah all right all right well let's move on and let's um go to loki with our next story

985
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:47,560
yeah so this is pretty cool like i know uh they did the similar things with different valve games

986
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:55,640
i can remember like portal and portal 2 had these in-game commentaries but now half-life alex also

987
01:37:55,640 --> 01:38:03,960
shares that as they've now received um three hours of commentary in that game so you can actually

988
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:09,080
check it out within the game itself and it kind of talks about the behind the scenes and a

989
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:16,440
development process of the game itself including 147 points of interest to find and uh talking

990
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:24,200
about the hands-on nature of uh their narration and it's also available in several different

991
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:30,600
uh languages if you want subtitles so that's pretty awesome as well um pretty cool i i

992
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:36,760
still haven't finished this game so i really do need to go back and play more half-life alex

993
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:40,520
because it's pretty awesome but i do like the commentaries that were in there as well they're

994
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:44,280
always very interesting okay i was gonna ask because i have to admit i don't know if i've

995
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:48,600
played a video game with the commentary on and i was kind of curious and opening it that this

996
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:52,680
question of the chat as well how many of you have played through video games with the commentary on

997
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:58,840
so you you have done this loki yeah i played through a little bit of portal i think and i think

998
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:05,480
that they had portal 2 had the same thing but you can actually go through that and uh check it out

999
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:09,320
and they have these like little icons on the screen you go up to and it talks about like

1000
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:14,040
especially with the original portal like different puzzle designs and stuff like that so it's pretty

1001
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:19,800
cool i've watched a couple of movies with commentary tracks but very few and i've always

1002
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:25,560
found that they're almost always better if there's more than one person when there's just one person

1003
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:29,560
it's not always the most exciting thing in the world it depends on who it is and i feel like

1004
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:36,840
some people don't want to be there but others do so it really um kind of changes that uh no one

1005
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:41,960
special 77 says when i still had a ps3 and the orange box for that i tried the commentary for

1006
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:46,520
that like i've probably like tried it but i don't think i've ever like actually said oh

1007
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:54,360
there's a commentary track out for this game i want to try it so it's interesting um sg100 matt

1008
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:58,360
says i haven't experienced this enough i get the sense i would do that on a second playthrough

1009
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:02,440
you know what if something like mass effect had a commentary track i'd probably play through with

1010
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:06,920
it but there's so much that that game is so long i'm not sure if a commentary track would really

1011
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:12,120
work but it'd be interesting so all right it'd be cool if like games like that let you create

1012
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:17,560
a custom commentary track like we could create one in game and like store different like clips

1013
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:22,120
here like hey you probably don't want to go around the corners jump scare over there just

1014
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:25,560
just beware jump scare right there well that's what you do in demon souls you leave the little

1015
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:32,680
pieces of paper at least i think you still do that anyway all right uh moving on uh i'm sure

1016
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:37,640
a lot of you saw this floating around social media this week and it's it's like the ridiculous like

1017
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:43,480
what the hell are you doing with these consoles and um so in this case did everybody see that

1018
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:49,320
video of the xbox series x where smoke was coming out of the top of the vent and it was that

1019
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:57,480
youtube that was like omg my xbox series x on launch day caught fire well you can very clearly

1020
01:40:57,480 --> 01:41:03,240
see in the corner there's smoke going into the xbox that then comes out of the holes on the top

1021
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:11,800
because yes somebody actually was blowing vape smoke into the vent at the bottom which of course

1022
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:18,600
smoke rises fun fact science and it came well at the top it's also because they developed that

1023
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:23,720
console to have nice airflow so it just sucks it up and spits it right out which is why the

1024
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:27,880
playstation 5 is also shaped the way it is is that it's to help with the airflow so you know

1025
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:32,200
both these consoles with their you know beefy parts that are doing all the fancy ray tracing

1026
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:37,640
and everything have to have really good airflow in it so honestly the vape smoke technique is

1027
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:42,840
showing wow the airflow is really good on these systems um yeah and i like i like the comment

1028
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:47,640
though that they had on like i can't believe i have to tell you this but yeah don't blow vape

1029
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:54,200
smoke into your xbox series x xbox actually put out a tweet uh a few days ago on november the 11th

1030
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:58,920
so i was actually the day before uh the day after the launch where they said we can't believe we

1031
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:04,200
have to say this but please do not blow vape smoke into your xbox series x

1032
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:12,120
but that just goes that also goes all into like the fake news type of thing we were just bringing

1033
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:18,040
up is that this person only did it to get clicks on omg and that that can have a negative impact

1034
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:21,960
on xbox because somebody's going to believe it like you got to see this video where a dude's

1035
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:29,480
micro thing caught fire people like chasing clout yeah i know yeah and as and as mentioned in chat

1036
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:36,520
by bobby yeah and also vape smoke can hurt your xbox like let's you know let's let's not forget

1037
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:40,680
that part is that you know there's what makes the vape smoke there's a little bit of water in there

1038
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:45,640
and stuff right you should not be putting those on computer parts and and i mean we should probably

1039
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:52,280
also ignore obviously i didn't watch any videos like this but i'm it they're always out there

1040
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:57,000
there's always the people that are smashing these new systems when they came out because

1041
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:01,400
you know four clicks because haha you can't get one i got one and now i'm gonna break it you know

1042
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:07,960
it's like i don't know whatever people are dumb whatever happened to the video where here's my

1043
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:15,160
brand new xbox series x but here's my knife uh-huh it's a cake like i thought that's where

1044
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:21,960
we were at in 2020 where's my xbox series x is actually a cake like where's that or playstation

1045
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:27,000
five i'll take that would have been a twist like oh hey look my xbox series x is on fire it's

1046
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:37,560
because it's a cake uh no unfortunately we're not there yet i don't know why i'm obsessed with those

1047
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:43,640
cake videos that are like surprise it's a case that i know it's a cake going in but i'm always

1048
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:52,840
kind of like wow these are like really well done cakes you know all right let's go let's go back

1049
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:59,720
to a simpler time when in fact it was not a cake it was it was just a game the classic game of the

1050
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:08,600
week it wasn't a cake it was a lie uh dark soccer is gonna step into the gaming vault and find a

1051
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:14,360
game that she thinks hey uh you should be checking out this game this week uh and this is oh man

1052
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:18,600
you've got a classic tonight it's one of those ones where it's like how has this never been

1053
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:23,720
picked before yet again here we are what i texted you yeah it is it is and that's why i'm saying it

1054
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:29,240
again what's funny as i was describing this to dan is the game where you run around in pajamas and

1055
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:35,880
shoot people's livers and spleens because that's kind of what they look like that is so the classic

1056
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:46,200
game of the week is uh alien syndrome so uh it is a running gun it was developed by sega and it came

1057
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:54,840
out in the arcades in 1987 um so basically you uh have two soldiers that you play as one named ricky

1058
01:44:54,840 --> 01:45:01,560
and one mary and they go through this levels that will have a way scrolling and you have to rescue

1059
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:10,120
your comrades who are being held by aliens who uh well they look like spleens and livers to me green

1060
01:45:10,120 --> 01:45:18,520
and and pink very pink looking organ meat um anyway um so uh after you rescue a certain number

1061
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:24,920
of hostages uh an exit will open and you can go through to fight you know the boss for the level

1062
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:30,280
the the end of level guardian as this likes to say and then when you've defeated it then you're able

1063
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:37,880
to go on to the next stage um and it does allow two players simultaneous um and you can do pickups

1064
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:45,400
to assist the character get different weapons get maps of the level um and you know it's it's a very

1065
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:54,680
very simple game that people can be kind of all up in arms about versions of it um so um the game

1066
01:45:54,680 --> 01:46:04,520
uh had different ports um in 1988 its first series of ports were on the sega master system the msx

1067
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:13,080
the amiga atari st the amstrad cpc commodore 64 and the uh famicon or nes that was published by

1068
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:18,920
tangen because nintendo would grant the license um there were later ports there was the zx spectrum

1069
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:28,360
in 1989 game gear in 1992 and oh gosh i wish i owned one of these a sharp x68000 in 1992 which

1070
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:34,280
was the only arcade perfect port because i mean it was fucking sharp x6800 what you by sixty

1071
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:43,000
eight thousand what would you expect um so and honestly it was just like it was sort of that

1072
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:50,280
era of you know of games right where it kind of had just like that almost minimalist kind of

1073
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:57,480
music to it and it was kind of simple but a little bit more complex than the other things you know it

1074
01:46:57,480 --> 01:47:08,760
was it was just a really cool game um it was uh listed as uh one of as the third most successful

1075
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:17,880
arcade unit um by a game machine in japan it was listed that um in 1987 in their article on it

1076
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:25,400
um the original version was also uh reviewed by computer and video games uh magazine in 87

1077
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:30,520
it was called one of the most gripping games they've been playing for months um and it was

1078
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:38,760
very reminiscent of of alien or uh you know or aliens i should say i mean i i honestly see more

1079
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:47,080
in common with alien than aliens but um you know and it also uh the master system version was

1080
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:56,520
actually given really really high ratings as well um so the game did get um uh an upgrade um for the

1081
01:47:56,520 --> 01:48:05,480
ps2 uh sega ages 2500 uh series um and uh it was brought over in the us in the sega classics

1082
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:10,760
collection um however it was ruined for the european version to get a lower age certificate

1083
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:19,160
they upgraded controls they uh gave it polygon graphics um analog controls um and they did

1084
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:24,600
include the original game as an unlockable in sonic's ultimate genesis collection um the thing

1085
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:30,920
is is that the sadly the sega ages version is not very good it really is not very good

1086
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:40,040
um there was a sequel also called alien syndrome that was released on wii and psp in 2007 and so

1087
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:46,840
there you go alien syndrome you know shoot shoot the alien headed thing shoot the livers and you

1088
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:52,760
know spleens that try to come at you it's kind of gauntlet-y you know with with aliens and spleens

1089
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:58,360
so there you go all right sorry i stepped away for a second but i'm back

1090
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:06,600
uh yes alien syndrome uh a game that uh i played this on the nes i think i remember the tengan

1091
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:14,360
cart for this uh and playing that so uh and it was hard i remember but maybe i'm better at games now

1092
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:23,960
i don't know i think that we may be now this is actually something i'm gonna go a little bit into

1093
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:33,960
it um i think that um it may not necessarily be a better or worse our perception's different

1094
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:41,480
and we're gonna try to do one thing one way when we're a kid but when you go back and play it when

1095
01:49:41,480 --> 01:49:46,280
you're older you sometimes try to follow that old instinct but you think something else is gonna

1096
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:52,120
make sense and i think that's just a difference in a gaming as a mature gamer that's very true

1097
01:49:52,120 --> 01:49:56,440
you know something like like mega man is very much a game about patterns right like you've

1098
01:49:56,440 --> 01:50:02,760
often talked about your um ability to play a certain section of mega man to all of us ability

1099
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:07,400
yeah like blindfolded because it's really it's really just a game about memorizing patterns

1100
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:11,720
if you think about it but being able to execute those patterns perfectly um and i think some of

1101
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:15,160
that is probably true with what i'm watching here on aliens it's been a long time since i

1102
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:19,800
played this game but um i and what i'm watching in the footage here is i'm like it's really just it

1103
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:23,240
seems like it's just patterns like this person knows exactly where they're running exactly what

1104
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:29,240
they're shooting um and there's like a pattern thing to it before i didn't say if it was a task

1105
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:39,480
play yeah uh um maybe but but i mean this is still the thing too is that with the older games like

1106
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:44,680
this they're a lot of them more patterns are you know there's not really as much i'd say uh

1107
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:51,640
programming real estate to have a more complicated ai in games like this good point

1108
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:57,000
yeah so and it doesn't look like and as far as i'm aware i don't think this particular

1109
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,960
game has a whole lot of rng to deal with short of boss battles

1110
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:08,840
so all right well a real classic there uh your classic game of the week alien syndrome

1111
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:12,920
uh originally in the arcade and then pretty much everywhere else at the time

1112
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:18,840
and that large list the dark sakura read us earlier all right well let's get into some

1113
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:24,600
rapid fire news and travel around the world and uh we'll look at world release dates right after

1114
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:30,600
but first some rapid fire news uh loki we'll start with you uh yes so there's lots of fun

1115
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:37,880
news regarding sam and max's week including a brand new uh remaster that's going to be coming to

1116
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:45,640
pc and switch uh this december so sam and max save the world remastered uh looks pretty awesome

1117
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:52,520
and um yeah i'd like some more sam max and with that i'm probably gonna get some more sam and max

1118
01:51:52,520 --> 01:52:01,160
because they're gonna be uh coming to vr as well with sam and max uh this time it's virtual and

1161
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:31,560

1162
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:37,160
which is on steam um we had him on the show uh because we thought it was funny that somebody

1163
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:41,320
actually made a game about cats and presidents though of course he'd never heard this show i

1164
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:46,600
mean who can blame him hardly anyone has so uh what i want to say though is that he did come

1165
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:52,840
out with just in the past couple months cat president too which just in time for the 2020

1199
02:00:19,160 --> 02:00:24,840
for me please i specifically wanted you to talk about that tonight because i wanted that reaction

1200
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:30,920
of i want it well and the other thing is that people go oh why is it digital because

1201
02:00:31,560 --> 02:00:35,560
digital music does not sell as well in japan as physical media

1202
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:47,000
so okay also um for people who are still into pokemon sapphire a fish beat pokemon sapphire

1203
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:57,960
after 3195 hours so um basically they have fish swimming around um and they use motion tracking

1204
02:00:57,960 --> 02:01:07,240
on them so uh these fish uh beat beat pokemon why are we reporting this because it's that

1205
02:01:07,240 --> 02:01:16,200
awkward moment when a fish has more gamer credibility than i do well basically i think

1206
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:20,200
it's also to demonstrate you know i like actually this particular article brings it up because it

1207
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:26,280
was the first thing i was thinking of was the uh the infinite monkey theorem that states if you

1208
02:01:26,280 --> 02:01:30,200
have a monkey hitting keys on a typewriter for an infinite amount of time it'll eventually type out

1209
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:36,280
a shakespeare play um that was all that that also goes back to the twitch place pokemon phenomenon

1210
02:01:36,280 --> 02:01:41,560
from a few years ago was in that exact same thing was cited the whole and i've heard it also as the

1211
02:01:41,560 --> 02:01:46,600
broken clock is right twice a day type of thing it's that same type of theory but on a much larger

1212
02:01:46,600 --> 02:01:53,640
scale so interesting all right uh let's move on and travel around the world and check out some

1213
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:58,680
release dates of some games that your fish might beat very soon or in 3000 days or whatever it took

1214

1220
02:02:38,600 --> 02:02:45,640
see a tiberian chat says it was the best of times it was the blurst of times that's a simpsons joke

1221
02:02:45,640 --> 02:02:50,360
isn't it i know it there and it's that whole thing with the monkey and the typewriter they're typing

1222
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:54,680
something and that's that's what he pulls out it was the best of times it was the blurst of times

1223
02:02:55,240 --> 02:03:02,520

1242
02:05:15,560 --> 02:05:19,320

1250
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:04,040

1251
02:06:04,040 --> 02:06:08,120
playstation 5 has nothing this week i imagine they've uh you know kind of put out all the stuff

1252
02:06:08,120 --> 02:06:13,640
the week the system came out uh for a little while uh looking at the playstation 4 though

1263
02:07:34,600 --> 02:07:40,200
all right let's move on we have some more stories for you guys i think it's very important that we

1264
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:49,800
elaborate on that game one more time um oh boy so taking a look at it so it's literally like flying

1265
02:07:49,800 --> 02:07:57,640
underwear that you're fighting as it is a 3d like fighting like action game where you play as

1266
02:07:57,640 --> 02:08:05,560
sentient underwear apparently it looks ridiculous uh phoenix 77 26 wants to know is chris hanson an

1267
02:08:05,560 --> 02:08:11,000
unlockable character well no it's it's not really people there's no people in the game it's just

1268
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:17,240
flying underwear all right uh well let's move on loki why don't you uh start us off with some more

1269
02:08:17,240 --> 02:08:25,320
actual news all right let's talk about it um so apparently there japan uh sony is gonna stop

1270
02:08:25,320 --> 02:08:31,720
servicing the original playstation 4 which seems quite surprising considering that um

1271
02:08:32,680 --> 02:08:38,440
i mean we just got the playstation 5 apparently they're what they're talking about is the original

1272
02:08:39,320 --> 02:08:47,480
version of the playstation 4 that launched back in 2014 they are gonna stop servicing but the slim

1273
02:08:47,480 --> 02:08:54,680
and pro series they're gonna still do repairs and whatnot on those um it's just the original model

1274
02:08:55,080 --> 02:09:04,200
which still though it seems like it's a pretty soon to stop um supporting that but you can do

1275
02:09:04,200 --> 02:09:07,800
whatever they want at least they know what a playstation 4 is and having completely forgot

1276
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:12,680
about it thank you vita the headlines on this i think were a little deceptive too because it

1277
02:09:12,680 --> 02:09:18,200
was saying like playstation 4 is no longer services well it's some it's the launch so but

1278
02:09:18,200 --> 02:09:23,640
it definitely uh it does seem pretty aggressive to be on its way out the door you know what i mean

1279
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:30,520
like the five just came out you know exactly i i think it's a bit soon and considering that you

1280
02:09:30,520 --> 02:09:36,280
know people are probably getting rid of their playstation fours for playstation fives i mean

1281
02:09:36,280 --> 02:09:40,440
they don't want to deal with the second hand maybe maybe i don't know but

1282
02:09:42,440 --> 02:09:48,280
i haven't i haven't decided if i want to keep my xbox one or maybe get rid of it um i just don't

1283
02:09:48,360 --> 02:09:53,400
know who won it this one you you want do you not have an xbox one dark sakura

1284
02:09:54,120 --> 02:10:01,400
oh i thought you guys had one no we got ps4 let's talk if i mean i at least want to borrow it yeah

1285
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:07,400
if you know what honestly yes i would be fine with you in this way you don't have to give me money

1286
02:10:07,400 --> 02:10:13,480
because i would be fine with it having a long-term home um because when we move eventually i'll

1287
02:10:13,480 --> 02:10:17,400
probably set it up as a secondary media player but i don't really have the space right now

1288
02:10:17,400 --> 02:10:22,440
so i'll be honest our ps3 and ps4 are both connected we use the ps4 for youtube and we

1289
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:28,920
use the ps3 for uh the few times we actually watch physical disc um not just oh bobby says i know

1290
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:32,840
some parents who want an xbox one because i can play minecraft well jamie if you if you really

1291
02:10:32,840 --> 02:10:38,120
want let's let's talk because i i can uh do that i'm a cat parent that wants to play minecraft

1292
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:42,040
well to be fair everything plays minecraft nowadays so it's fine that's true too um

1293
02:10:42,040 --> 02:10:46,040
anyways just speaking of which jamie um i guess uh you're gonna go ahead and bow out for the night

1294
02:10:46,200 --> 02:10:49,880
just to take care of yourself and because you've been a little under the weather so uh

1295
02:10:49,880 --> 02:10:53,080
and we could hear we could hear it you're starting to go during the release dates so um

1296
02:10:53,720 --> 02:10:57,640
uh thank you of course for sticking it out and being here tonight glad glad you got to have a

1297
02:10:57,640 --> 02:11:02,520
full show tonight sort of sorta i mean without the i'm referring to the power drops last week

1298
02:11:02,520 --> 02:11:10,120
or god internet drops last week the goal is with uh another week of resting my voice that i will be

1299
02:11:10,760 --> 02:11:18,440
100 so fingers crossed but i i would also still like to take the opportunity to tell people

1300
02:11:18,440 --> 02:11:24,760
pay the fuck attention to what cdc is telling you wear your mask social distance don't fucking go

1301
02:11:24,760 --> 02:11:30,040
to anybody's house for thanksgiving just saying yeah unless you've all been tested

1302
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:36,760
we're doing we're doing the two-week stay at home thing so we can see my dad but that is it we are

1303
02:11:36,760 --> 02:11:42,360
only seeing my dad so but like i can't let him be alone i can't so yeah i understand i'm taking

1304
02:11:42,360 --> 02:11:49,000
i'm actually taking a test on uh monday to to test myself again they sent me three boxes of tests

1305
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:55,160
from work i'm like why you already tested me yeah all right take care of yourself jamie we'll talk

1306
02:11:55,160 --> 02:12:01,560
to you in a week thanks bye all right moving on let's get to our next story where we talk about

1307
02:12:01,960 --> 02:12:06,680
youtube premium and i gotta fix the cameras here real quick though sorry

1308
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:13,160
awkward transition all right there we go all right um let's talk about a free google stadia

1309
02:12:13,160 --> 02:12:18,920
but the catch is you have to be a youtube premium member so you get the 99 bundle that features a

1310
02:12:18,920 --> 02:12:24,840
chromecast ultra and a gamepad if you are a youtube premium member this is for members in

1311
02:12:24,840 --> 02:12:29,960
the us and the uk you get the stadia premiere edition a 99 bundle with the chromecast ultra

1312
02:12:29,960 --> 02:12:35,000
and stadia controller and uh yeah you get that and then you get a free month of stadia pro with

1313
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:40,280
that but you have to remember to cancel that or they're gonna get you on that um so i'm sure this

1314
02:12:40,280 --> 02:12:45,640
is where people want to insert the joke that they can't even give it away well you know what like i

1315
02:12:46,840 --> 02:12:52,920
well for one stadia is supposed to be free anyway so like you know what are you getting you're

1316
02:12:52,920 --> 02:12:57,160
getting the chromecast ultra that's kind of like the first level of doing this but the weird thing

1317
02:12:57,160 --> 02:13:05,720
is um alan has been like a youtube subscriber for a long time um and he couldn't get one it said he

1318
02:13:05,720 --> 02:13:10,680
wasn't eligible for it i didn't get that but google has also given away quite a few things

1319
02:13:10,680 --> 02:13:15,160
both alan and i have google homes well we have obviously we have two in the house one in the

1320
02:13:15,160 --> 02:13:20,440
bedroom in the living room because of our spotify subscriptions and they gave away a free google

1321
02:13:20,440 --> 02:13:24,760
with that or his might have even come from a cell phone i don't remember but google has definitely

1322
02:13:24,760 --> 02:13:28,760
given their stuff away before i don't know what do you what do you think about them giving away

1323
02:13:28,760 --> 02:13:36,840
stadia chromecast and all that for free loki i mean i guess they figured if you're buying

1324
02:13:36,840 --> 02:13:43,000
their youtube premium service that you're probably ripe to you know be interested in

1325
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:51,720
such a terrible service as stadia um no i i don't know it's it sounds like a last ditch effort to

1326
02:13:51,720 --> 02:13:58,840
try to get people either hooked on youtube premium or stadia i i just think they're gonna have to

1327
02:13:58,840 --> 02:14:05,160
change their model at some point to make it more like games pass but i don't know we'll see um

1328
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:11,080
it sucks that he's not able to redeem that considering he would be a subscriber to

1329
02:14:11,080 --> 02:14:15,960
you know um yeah i don't know what your premium the weird hold up is i have to look into what

1330
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:20,840
kind of error message he's getting or whatever but anyway um and some comments here uh did you

1331
02:14:20,840 --> 02:14:25,720
rama s in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says damn google is desperate to get rid of them

1332
02:14:25,720 --> 02:14:32,280
um maybe but remember here's the thing stadia is supposed to be free anyway but the weird the

1333
02:14:32,280 --> 02:14:38,840
missing part here is that how how far are we into the launch of stadia and we still don't have that

1334
02:14:38,840 --> 02:14:44,600
version that you just sign on to the web and play unless you are a pro subscriber right or am i

1335
02:14:44,600 --> 02:14:50,440
mixing that up can you just go on with any old gmail account and do it now on the web i don't

1336
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:54,440
know you could do it with pro but i don't think you could do it with just like a free one

1337
02:14:54,440 --> 02:15:01,000
um so it's it's just the whole thing's a little weird um i just feel like google just

1338
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:08,120
flood this launch so bad i don't know um pixel pocket says i'm very sad about google play music

1339
02:15:08,120 --> 02:15:12,120
i downloaded all my stuff and put it on my plex server instead i forgot they just recently shut

1340
02:15:12,120 --> 02:15:18,040
that down that's right um i think i had a bunch of olr episodes on there a bunch of old ones

1341
02:15:18,040 --> 02:15:24,520
so um yeah uh st100 matt says they want to get folks to get it so they can release that

1342
02:15:24,520 --> 02:15:29,640
gotta have stadia game which they don't have yet so it'll be interesting to see the effect this

1343
02:15:29,640 --> 02:15:35,320
has i know people that are cashing in on it because hey free chrome cast right it's not

1344
02:15:35,320 --> 02:15:40,520
just a stadia it's a chrome cast so i know people that are cashing in on it is it some type of maybe

1345
02:15:40,520 --> 02:15:44,840
trojan horse trick i don't know especially when they talk about signing you up for a free month

1346
02:15:44,840 --> 02:15:50,040
the stadia pro i i don't know but it'll be interesting to see what kind of impact this

1347
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:56,360
might have on stadia if any so i would i still think it's just their core service isn't worth

1348
02:15:56,360 --> 02:16:03,080
paying for i mean it just doesn't paying for the service and then i have to also buy the games on

1349
02:16:03,080 --> 02:16:07,960
the service doesn't make any sense it's just especially when there's other companies offering

1350
02:16:08,680 --> 02:16:15,560
stuff it it's just cheaper and like i i don't get what the the value proposition is that they're

1351
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:23,240
saying especially since there's not new really i mean aside from there's nothing really exclusive

1352
02:16:23,240 --> 02:16:29,560
to that platform either like i just don't get what they are hoping to do with this like i i don't

1353
02:16:29,560 --> 02:16:34,520
know oh now this is a service again die dgrms says alan couldn't get it because the promotion

1354
02:16:34,920 --> 02:16:40,280
for it ran out so people in chat are asking how do i get in on this it sounds like you might it's

1355
02:16:40,920 --> 02:16:48,600
all have been claimed the end so interesting brilliant i wonder if this was all just a trick

1356
02:16:48,600 --> 02:16:53,000
to get out get us all to talk about it i don't know but it would be great if they could put out

1357
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:57,080
like that killer game that would i know i'm totally getting stadia now that i've talked

1358
02:16:57,080 --> 02:17:05,720
about it yeah all right uh moving on to another story and uh this has to do with uh the the not

1359
02:17:05,720 --> 02:17:11,240
twitch con is going on right now the glitch con or whatever um and this is some i i didn't really

1360
02:17:11,240 --> 02:17:18,200
catch a lot of big twitch news out of that i i like a big new feature coming or anything like

1361
02:17:18,200 --> 02:17:22,200
that maybe you guys did and can correct me in chat and that feature is that they're gonna start

1362
02:17:22,280 --> 02:17:28,440
flagging your games for wins besides all of that besides all of that letting that go for a minute

1363
02:17:28,440 --> 02:17:33,960
um well one of the big stories that came out of it was that um the co why can't i read this article

1364
02:17:33,960 --> 02:17:39,880
here okay the co of able gamers who's uh pretty popular on social media uh steven spon i hope i

1365
02:17:39,880 --> 02:17:44,680
said his last name right sorry um but he's the co of able gamers and this charity has been around

1366
02:17:44,680 --> 02:17:48,680
a while it's actually um the charity that my amazon smile is set to for what it's worth

1367
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:54,280
and they're they do a lot of great things for gamers with disabilities um in in video games

1368
02:17:54,280 --> 02:18:02,920
and one of the cool things that happened uh out of glitch con was that uh the co steven had wanted

1369
02:18:02,920 --> 02:18:08,760
to for his birthday because he just hit his 40th birthday i believe wanted to raise one million

1370
02:18:08,760 --> 02:18:15,480
dollars for the able gamers charity and um twitch just said here you go here's a million bucks for

1371
02:18:15,480 --> 02:18:21,080
able gamers so there's your goal and then some so that's pretty awesome uh and that all happened

1372
02:18:21,080 --> 02:18:26,840
during a stream with dr lupo and the ceo of twitch uh emmett shear uh and that twitch is

1373
02:18:26,840 --> 02:18:33,080
going to donate one million dollars to able gamers that is pretty awesome uh and it's interesting

1374
02:18:33,080 --> 02:18:38,760
because uh steven has said on twitter i've talked to the rock i've talked to ryan reynolds i'm

1375
02:18:38,760 --> 02:18:43,080
paraphrasing this is not exact words i've talked to the rock i've talked to ryan reynolds but

1376
02:18:43,080 --> 02:18:46,360
that is the one that caught me caught me off guard so that is cool

1377
02:18:47,560 --> 02:18:54,120
great charity good news we like gaming good news all right i'm trying to look in chat to see if

1378
02:18:54,120 --> 02:18:59,720
anybody had said uh uh bobby blackwolf says that's nice of them considering twitch just laid off

1379
02:18:59,720 --> 02:19:04,920
their accessibility manager i guess it's easier to give money to charity than actually do any

1380
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:06,120
accessibility work

1381
02:19:10,840 --> 02:19:17,800
but true which did you catch my subtle segue to our next story logi yes i it was so subtle

1382
02:19:19,240 --> 02:19:25,560
so uh we got to hear from tommy talarico this week and you may be wondering what the hell does

1383
02:19:25,560 --> 02:19:32,840
that have to do with roblox well it's because apparently uh roblox corporation um lifted a

1384
02:19:32,840 --> 02:19:39,720
little bit of his sound effects uh or sound design from an old game called messiah back in

1385
02:19:39,720 --> 02:19:46,920
2000 and thought no one would notice but apparently someone did and so there was uh some stuff behind

1386
02:19:46,920 --> 02:19:52,920
the scenes and they finally settled to where uh the game the game is no longer not gonna have that

1387
02:19:52,920 --> 02:20:01,240
oof uh sound effect for free um so what's happening basically is tommy talarico is going to

1388
02:20:01,240 --> 02:20:08,600
allow them to have that sound effect back in the game if you are a creator of games on roblox you

1389
02:20:08,600 --> 02:20:15,240
can actually purchase the sound effect to use in your games for 100 um robux i think it's like

1390
02:20:15,240 --> 02:20:21,640
a dollar and then on top of that he's also going to be creating some new sound effects that you

1391
02:20:21,640 --> 02:20:27,160
could also use in your games as well ranging anywhere from like 10 bucks to 250 dollars

1392
02:20:27,160 --> 02:20:31,720
depending on the number of sounds that are included with it so it's available to developers

1393
02:20:31,720 --> 02:20:37,240
on there also he is uh working with the roblox corporation to create an official oof t-shirt

1394
02:20:37,240 --> 02:20:41,560
they're gonna sell them sure he's gonna get proceeds from uh but basically yeah the whole

1395
02:20:41,560 --> 02:20:47,880
thing's been settled without uh seems like a lawsuit um but yeah that was kind of interesting

1396
02:20:47,880 --> 02:20:52,360
that they've been well i wouldn't say it's interesting because if you've played roblox or

1397
02:20:52,360 --> 02:20:58,920
of browse through roblox you'll know that because a lot of the developer a lot of these games are

1398
02:20:58,920 --> 02:21:05,880
created by kids kids have no concept of copyright law or i mean this is literally just a bomb

1399
02:21:05,880 --> 02:21:12,360
waiting to go off as far as ip theft goes it's just ridiculous and so it's not surprising that

1400
02:21:12,360 --> 02:21:18,520
at the heart of the game more ip theft my my understanding of how that all happened was that

1401
02:21:18,520 --> 02:21:26,120
you know when they made roblox they kind of got like a uh one of those like a 1000 sound effects

1402
02:21:26,120 --> 02:21:31,720
licenseable for your thing or whatever and i'm i'm i don't know those exact details but it's one

1403
02:21:31,720 --> 02:21:38,040
of those like you know license a bunch of sound effects and the oof was included in there and oof

1404
02:21:38,040 --> 02:21:42,760
it shouldn't have been because it wasn't licensed from tommy or anything like that it was essentially

1405
02:21:42,760 --> 02:21:49,000
stolen so roblox thought that they had licensed it appropriately but it sounds like this middle

1406
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:54,200
person uh is the one that's really to blame whoever had ripped it off for their collection

1407
02:21:54,200 --> 02:22:01,800
so interesting yeah so at least there is no harm no foul but they've worked on you know uh some

1408
02:22:01,800 --> 02:22:08,120
fair resolution for it uh no one specials on fire tonight uh pixel pakka says official oof t-shirt

1409
02:22:08,120 --> 02:22:15,800
lol to which no one special 77 chat replies it's an official t-shirt nice

1410
02:22:19,480 --> 02:22:25,960
yeah so you've been listening to orange lounge radio sorry i had to i had to do the roll credits

1411
02:22:25,960 --> 02:22:32,920
on the bad joke all right go ahead are we gonna see uh are we gonna see any uh roblox heading to

1412
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:39,640
the amico or anything like that now that tommy's uh mixed that would be a gag that would be a gag

1413
02:22:39,640 --> 02:22:45,960
but i believe that the um the rule on amico is that everything has to be for amico and exclusive

1414
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:51,240
to it i mean they could maybe dance around and have some type of uh official uh roblox

1415
02:22:52,760 --> 02:22:59,720
side game or version but um who knows anything's possible i guess yeah all right

1416
02:23:00,680 --> 02:23:04,200
one more story for you guys before we get to the round table let's talk about

1417
02:23:04,200 --> 02:23:11,640
plague inc this game has uh been talked about especially this year i can't imagine why but um

1418
02:23:12,280 --> 02:23:19,080
there's a new mode that they launched uh just in time where you try to stop a pandemic do you

1419
02:23:19,080 --> 02:23:26,680
think it's easy boys and girls well now you can try uh through plague inc so uh this new mode

1420
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:31,880
called the cure mode you have to find a balance between contact tracing that scene research

1421
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:38,360
helping to save the economy locking down as appropriate and so forth uh to try to bring

1422
02:23:38,360 --> 02:23:44,600
the end of a pandemic and if you figure it out call the white house um and let them know because

1423
02:23:44,600 --> 02:23:50,200
uh they might need some help but yeah so interesting is that it's the reverse of what

1424
02:23:50,280 --> 02:23:57,240
plague inc kind of was before is that you actually wanted to spread a virus to wipe out humanity

1425
02:23:57,240 --> 02:24:03,720
so this is the the more hopeful version of that to go for 2020 so i think that's kind of interesting

1426
02:24:03,720 --> 02:24:08,200
it's cute that the game's been turned on its head like that so have you ever played this game loki

1427
02:24:08,200 --> 02:24:12,760
i have to admit i haven't no i have i've heard a lot about it uh certainly because of what's

1428
02:24:12,760 --> 02:24:18,360
been going on this year so i imagine there'll be some streams and things like that so all right

1429
02:24:18,360 --> 02:24:26,120
um let's get to the listener roundtable we're going to invite your questions and comments uh

1430
02:24:26,120 --> 02:24:31,960
to our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network also um this is the part of the show

1431
02:24:31,960 --> 02:24:38,600
where we get into the mailbag now this week we didn't have any emails however because last week's

1432
02:24:38,600 --> 02:24:43,400
show got cut off early thanks to the internet we actually had some emails from last week we never

1433
02:24:43,400 --> 02:24:48,760
got to so i do want to read these two emails but i am going to warn you guys um it may be a little

1434
02:24:48,760 --> 02:24:54,680
dated because we're now two weeks from when they were sent um but let's get to our first email

1435
02:24:54,680 --> 02:24:59,960
tonight which is from i believe this is no one special although it's unsigned uh all right here

1436
02:24:59,960 --> 02:25:04,920
we go hi all i hope all is well with you this week since it's been a while since my last email

1437
02:25:04,920 --> 02:25:09,160
i thought i'd send one this week uh plus unless i think of something at the last second sending

1438
02:25:09,160 --> 02:25:13,400
this email negates the need for me to send one of my long-winded listener roundtable subjects

1439
02:25:13,400 --> 02:25:19,080
so while this isn't wholly email worthy i do have some good news to report so for brevity's sake i'll

1440
02:25:19,080 --> 02:25:24,680
tldr this despite it being incredibly late and i have giving up any hope of getting it i will

1441
02:25:24,680 --> 02:25:30,120
finally get that 1200 stimulus check in about a week i got a call from my ssdpe the other day

1442
02:25:30,120 --> 02:25:34,360
stating that she just received it on my behalf since stimulus checks went out to wherever people

1443
02:25:34,360 --> 02:25:38,200
who are on social security have their federal monthly checks sent and when her agency mails

1444
02:25:38,200 --> 02:25:42,360
out checks this week she'll forward the money to me now i'm imagining that there's a chance that

1445
02:25:42,360 --> 02:25:46,520
at least one of you are asking yourselves okay good for you what does this relate to gaming

1446
02:25:46,520 --> 02:25:51,880
after all olr is a show about gaming well to be fair it's a show about gaming and tangents

1447
02:25:53,560 --> 02:25:58,360
good point i'm getting to that as i've mentioned from time to time in the past one thing i've

1448
02:25:58,360 --> 02:26:02,280
always wanted was an honest to goodness arcade cabinet something like a classic game from the

1449
02:26:02,280 --> 02:26:07,560
80s or 90s be it any version of street fighter 2 one of the 2d mortal combat games cruisin usa

1450
02:26:07,560 --> 02:26:13,160
a neo geo mvs etc even with 1200 i still can't afford one of those unfortunately

1451
02:26:14,040 --> 02:26:19,480
they are closer to 2500 or 3000 at the least so that being said i'm going to bite the proverbial

1452
02:26:19,480 --> 02:26:26,280
bullet and buy the arcade one up version of the neo geo mvs from amazon linked to the amazon page

1453
02:26:26,280 --> 02:26:32,920
now before i go any further i don't recall arcade one up doing a neo geo no it's snk actually thank

1454
02:26:32,920 --> 02:26:39,480
you okay that's what i thought so snks actually themselves however it is it is probably happening

1455
02:26:39,480 --> 02:26:46,120
due to the success of arcade one up and i'm sure we have arcade one up to thank for this coming out

1456
02:26:46,120 --> 02:26:51,240
and it's very much in a similar vein to the arcade one up machines but i do just want to make that

1457
02:26:51,240 --> 02:26:57,880
clarity point is that arcade one up themselves is not the one doing it but you wouldn't necessarily

1458
02:26:57,880 --> 02:27:04,600
know by looking okay so um that all being said let me finish email maybe if i can swing it i'll

1459
02:27:04,600 --> 02:27:09,160
also order a few things from my pc on top of the neo geo mvs like new ram new controller and so

1460
02:27:09,160 --> 02:27:14,040
forth but that last part aside despite it not being perfect like not an actual arcade machine

1461
02:27:14,040 --> 02:27:18,280
that would accept quarters and tokens and have cartridge slots i'm still excited to have the next

1462
02:27:18,280 --> 02:27:23,880
best thing i do have a two-part question for you all have any of you at a minimum had an opportunity

1463
02:27:23,880 --> 02:27:28,840
to try the arcade one up version of the neo geo mvs um i'm gonna rephrase that to what we just

1464
02:27:28,840 --> 02:27:34,600
discussed and if so what are your thoughts on it pros and cons i haven't i didn't even know it was

1465
02:27:34,600 --> 02:27:41,880
out i thought it was coming out but he did link us to an amazon page where ah okay this item will

1466
02:27:41,880 --> 02:27:48,840
be released on november 24th so that's the answer none of us have played it yet because we can't it's

1467
02:27:48,840 --> 02:27:54,920
not out yet um well uh i've seen like video reviews from folks that have are familiar with

1468
02:27:54,920 --> 02:28:00,680
the mvs and um have played a lot of that through like a super gun or something like that and

1469
02:28:00,680 --> 02:28:07,400
talking about what it is in it sounds like it's pretty good as far as mimicking the mvs and um

1470
02:28:07,400 --> 02:28:14,600
the only complaints some people had were like maybe the controller might not be exactly what

1471
02:28:14,600 --> 02:28:20,280
you want but that's probably could be swapped out part-wise um some of the buttons and everything

1472
02:28:20,280 --> 02:28:26,440
um some of the graphics filters were kind of annoying like for example they had some where

1473
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:31,560
if you wanted certain scan lines in there they only had it with like the graphics smoothing

1474
02:28:31,560 --> 02:28:38,200
option which is kind of irritating instead of like the pixel perfect option um so you may just

1475
02:28:39,160 --> 02:28:44,600
some of those issues might be a thing but otherwise it's a pretty good recreation of it

1476
02:28:44,600 --> 02:28:49,400
i think yeah and just you know i'm gonna have to base my assumption based off of actual arcade

1477
02:28:49,400 --> 02:28:54,360
one-up machines and what this is trying to emulate i will say number one it has a pretty impressive

1478
02:28:54,360 --> 02:28:58,120
lineup of games in it you know most of those arcade one-up machines only have five or six

1479
02:28:58,120 --> 02:29:02,360
games in them which is a problem for some people i'm not so bothered by it i get what they're

1480
02:29:02,360 --> 02:29:07,080
trying to do with that kind of like limited release but um the neo geo one does sound very

1481
02:29:07,080 --> 02:29:12,120
robust so there is that and um it's going to be a different you know kind of screen on it from

1482
02:29:12,120 --> 02:29:15,720
what you remember in the arcades back in the day um but i actually think that makes it more

1483
02:29:15,720 --> 02:29:20,920
manageable but i think the way you kind of phrased it where it's the next best thing i think is

1484
02:29:20,920 --> 02:29:25,640
probably going to be appropriate is like it's probably going to be enough for you to kind of

1485
02:29:25,640 --> 02:29:30,840
invoke those memories of playing it at an arcade you wouldn't want to deal with the quarter stuff

1486
02:29:30,840 --> 02:29:35,480
and all that stuff well i shouldn't say that i'm not to say who what type of collector people are

1487
02:29:35,480 --> 02:29:42,440
and so forth but let me rephrase that quarter stuff and token slot and all that that might be

1488
02:29:42,440 --> 02:29:47,320
more hassle than you think especially if you just want to get in there and play the games so you

1489
02:29:47,320 --> 02:29:51,640
know what there might actually be an upside to some of this but i i'd be curious to hear your

1490
02:29:51,640 --> 02:29:57,000
thoughts once you get it all sorted out and this comes in and by the way before anybody says

1491
02:29:57,000 --> 02:30:02,680
anything about spending a stimulus check on an arcade machine um people can spend the money

1492
02:30:02,680 --> 02:30:08,040
however they like and there's plenty of people that are spending the stimulus check on vacations

1493
02:30:08,040 --> 02:30:13,640
and things of that sort so how is this any different um and you know what i it's one of

1494
02:30:13,640 --> 02:30:19,240
those things where it's like i also totally recognize that like 2020 has been hard on people's

1495
02:30:19,240 --> 02:30:24,040
mental health across the board so like if this is something that a person can buy to make themselves

1496
02:30:24,040 --> 02:30:31,080
happy for a day again who am i to judge i ain't so i just wanted to get that out there because

1497
02:30:31,080 --> 02:30:35,160
i could see how some folks might be kind of asking some questions there and just remember

1498
02:30:35,160 --> 02:30:40,120
it's not your place to ask that question all right anyway the rest of the email thanks for taking

1499
02:30:40,120 --> 02:30:44,440
the time to read and answer this email this email is brought to you by the front door of the white

1500
02:30:44,440 --> 02:30:49,160
house which hopefully will hit drum part on the ass on his way out na na na na na na na hey hey

1501
02:30:49,160 --> 02:30:55,080

camera unfortunately but he's sitting here uh giving his opinion all right uh black kompat in

1504
02:31:07,480 --> 02:31:14,920
chat says retail therapy has been saving grace for me this year same like you know did i need

1505
02:31:14,920 --> 02:31:23,800
an xbox series x probably not am i happy i bought one yeah so there you go all right uh let's get to

1506
02:31:23,800 --> 02:31:29,400
one more email which is from yyr and again this is a dated email because of last week's issues

1507
02:31:29,400 --> 02:31:34,520
hello lr i wanted to weigh in oh by the way before i get into this too far yyr did i saw

1508
02:31:34,520 --> 02:31:39,560
this on discord i'm sorry i didn't see the stream but he did some type of charity stream today where

1509
02:31:39,560 --> 02:31:48,680
he was supposed to play max 300 41 times in a row to celebrate or was it 40 or 41 to celebrate

1510
02:31:48,680 --> 02:31:56,440
turning his age so i i thought that was impressive dude because i i don't even think i've ever been

1511
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:02,760
one time yeah um even a nine-footer that's pretty hard that i probably could still do like let's

1512
02:32:02,760 --> 02:32:10,920
say orion seven eight siv mix right i still like i still remember how those notes go in my head

1513
02:32:10,920 --> 02:32:16,280
um but and and for some of you probably have no idea what we're talking about this is a ddr thing

1514
02:32:16,280 --> 02:32:24,200
okay um but uh the fact that he could do that 41 times that in itself is impressive i i hope it

1515
02:32:24,200 --> 02:32:29,880
went i hope the stream went very well i'm sorry i missed it um sunday's a very busy day oh sj100

1516
02:32:29,880 --> 02:32:35,720
matt says yyr's birthday is today well happy birthday all right well let's finish the birthday

1517
02:32:35,720 --> 02:32:40,440
boy's email okay uh i wanted to weigh in on the playstation 5 backwards compatibility issue we

1518
02:32:40,440 --> 02:32:44,760
were talking about on last week's show again we might be dealing with some dated things because

1519
02:32:44,760 --> 02:32:49,080
we've had some answered questions since then but let's move on we have a list a short one but a

1520
02:32:49,080 --> 02:32:53,960
list nonetheless of seemingly random games that we're told won't run on playstation 5 at all

1521
02:32:53,960 --> 02:32:58,120
we have a disclaimer on every playstation 4 game in the playstation store warning us that there

1522
02:32:58,120 --> 02:33:02,920
may be issues running it on playstation 5 and now we have ubisoft mentioning then unmentioning

1523
02:33:02,920 --> 02:33:08,680
issues with some of their ps4 games on ps5 personally for me this adds up to a bad omen i

1524
02:33:08,680 --> 02:33:13,080
get the sense that the playstation 5's backwards compatibility is going to come with asterisks and

1525
02:33:13,080 --> 02:33:17,800
kavats and that we're not going to get the full sense of what all these are until the consoles

1526
02:33:17,800 --> 02:33:22,680
are already in our hands i get the distinct impression that sony did not fully plan for this

1527
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:27,160
as microsoft certainly appears to have done and that if someone is looking specifically to play

1528
02:33:27,160 --> 02:33:31,880
playstation 4 games they should probably buy a playstation 4 rather than bank on the theory that

1529
02:33:31,880 --> 02:33:37,960
playstation 5 would play them perfectly all of that said i hope to be proven wrong so now we

1530
02:33:37,960 --> 02:33:46,440
have some answers was yyr wrong i would say not completely because he did say there play them

1531
02:33:46,440 --> 02:33:56,040
perfectly and we have news it's not perfect but it's playable right so and i think those are some

1532
02:33:56,040 --> 02:34:01,080
of the nuances that might have caused some of that confusion uh that we got again when when

1533
02:34:01,080 --> 02:34:05,560
ubisoft to put out that announcement there so there's that's kind of my take on it now that

1534
02:34:05,560 --> 02:34:10,840
the consoles are out in people's hands is that it's not perfect and if you want to play perfect

1535
02:34:10,840 --> 02:34:15,720
if you want to play the game it was absolutely meant to be designed for especially if they

1536
02:34:15,720 --> 02:34:21,080
didn't do an updated release like no man's sky or something you want to play it on a playstation 4

1537
02:34:21,080 --> 02:34:28,440
and this is you know this is emulation versus the real thing right and there's always going to be

1538
02:34:28,440 --> 02:34:33,320
people with their strong opinions one way or the other so and fifth dream says that it wants to say

1539
02:34:33,320 --> 02:34:39,800
that is also on a vast minority of games most games play way better on playstation 5 and

1540
02:34:39,800 --> 02:34:45,400
especially when you're talking about first party games i'm sure because you know they went in and

1541
02:34:45,400 --> 02:34:50,840
and made those better or made sure they would work and they would work better anyway to conclude

1542
02:34:50,840 --> 02:34:56,040
birthday boys email uh thanks again for the show oh and by the way i wasn't kidding when i said to

1543
02:34:56,040 --> 02:35:02,920
expect a pixel poops announcement soon so please look forward to that have a great week erin or yyr

1544
02:35:02,920 --> 02:35:08,760
well i'm not what it's been a week where's my announcement all right now i'm excited to see

1545
02:35:08,760 --> 02:35:14,840
whatever he has in store that's awesome all right that's it for our emails um again looking at chat

1546
02:35:14,840 --> 02:35:19,400
to see if there's any questions i don't see any questions a lot of people impressed on the max 300

1547
02:35:19,400 --> 02:35:24,360
thing in chat for what it's worth uh loki do we have any last minute stories tonight um yeah there

1548
02:35:24,360 --> 02:35:32,360
was one quick thing so apparently some fans have ported over driver 2 to pc which is interesting

1549
02:35:32,360 --> 02:35:40,120
because it was originally a playstation exclusive um so now they have this open source uh they

1550
02:35:40,120 --> 02:35:45,560
basic basically pulled a mario 64 on it they reverse engineered the original code and then

1551
02:35:45,560 --> 02:35:51,320
made an actual proper port of it and they're releasing it just in time for the 20th anniversary

1552
02:35:51,320 --> 02:35:59,800
so it's called redriver 2 project and it's uh available on github github.com open driver 2

1553
02:36:00,280 --> 02:36:07,800
redriver 2 it's free by the way which i'm sure is going to get them in trouble so get it while you

1554
02:36:07,800 --> 02:36:15,080
can all right so um and also i got a text before the show from shane and maybe some of you in chat

1555
02:36:15,080 --> 02:36:22,840
have more of a grip of what's going on the situation um but apparently uh capcom has had

1556
02:36:22,840 --> 02:36:28,200
some information leak out um what was what the tech say a ton of capcom leaks just happened it

1557
02:36:28,200 --> 02:36:33,480
looks like by the way and that did trigger my memory about that last week we had a story i

1558
02:36:33,480 --> 02:36:37,160
don't remember if we got to it or not it might have been cut because of the internet issue

1559
02:36:37,160 --> 02:36:43,960
but there was a story about that customer data from capcom had leaked or or yeah apparently uh

1560
02:36:43,960 --> 02:36:49,960
this is something different so it says uh apparently a group a hacker group has stolen

1561
02:36:49,960 --> 02:36:55,720
a one terabyte worth of stuff uh but only have leaked 60 gigabytes of it and includes the devil

1562
02:36:55,720 --> 02:37:02,760
may cry 2 source code umbrella chronicles source code resident evil 4 vr ace attorney collection

1563
02:37:02,760 --> 02:37:10,600
for playstation 4 and switch is this the same group that did this to nintendo i don't know

1564
02:37:11,560 --> 02:37:16,120
that's my that's my curiosity yeah and that's what fifth dream is asking as well is uh are all

1565
02:37:16,120 --> 02:37:20,680
these leaks coming from the same leakers uh i'd be very curious about that because if i was another

1566
02:37:20,680 --> 02:37:26,680
gaming company right now i would be putting the the the law i mean i'm sure these i mean nintendo

1567
02:37:26,680 --> 02:37:30,840
you would think would be secure as it is in capcom so i don't know how they're getting in if they're

1568
02:37:30,840 --> 02:37:35,880
doing social engineering or what they're doing to get into this stuff but if i was a gaming company

1569
02:37:35,880 --> 02:37:41,080
i would be looking at my security policies real good right now because this is uh you know and

1570
02:37:41,080 --> 02:37:46,760
this again puts us in this weird ethical gray area where i don't think it's necessarily right

1571
02:37:46,760 --> 02:37:52,520
to be spreading all of this stuff that is hacked but it's all over social media it can't be avoided

1572
02:37:52,520 --> 02:37:59,320
it is what gamers are talking about so i just hope video game companies are are trying to take the

1573
02:37:59,320 --> 02:38:03,640
steps they needs that they don't suffer the same fate this is really rough i don't know what else

1574
02:38:03,640 --> 02:38:09,640
to say um fifth dream says what i understand some of these leaks happened years ago they're just

1575
02:38:09,640 --> 02:38:15,320
dribbling them out uh bob coffee says nintendo's if i recall correctly was leaked via a chinese

1576
02:38:15,320 --> 02:38:21,640
company that did the iq devices not nintendo proper well it's still you know what anytime

1577
02:38:21,640 --> 02:38:26,040
you have vendor agreements or whatever it is you got to make sure that stuff is on lockdown it's

1578
02:38:26,040 --> 02:38:31,160
it's any game company if you know what i don't know how many people we have out there still

1579
02:38:31,160 --> 02:38:38,360
listening that work in the game industry but i would be so curious if your company and i realize

1580
02:38:38,360 --> 02:38:43,160
y'all can't really tell me but you know you can tell me on the down low if you want um i would be

1581
02:38:43,160 --> 02:38:47,880
so curious if your company doesn't blast some sort of security information this week or if if

1582
02:38:47,880 --> 02:38:53,240
it hasn't already in the last couple weeks some sort of training everybody has to take on security

1583
02:38:53,240 --> 02:39:00,440
or changed measures or whatever just to make sure that this doesn't happen to the next company

1584
02:39:00,440 --> 02:39:08,760
because that's two big ones now and that's uh that's an oof for sure so all right anything else

1585
02:39:08,840 --> 02:39:13,720
we should talk about loki or is that it i think that's it i'm sure we'll hire more about that

1586
02:39:13,720 --> 02:39:18,520
next week yeah the capcom thing i it's it's we it's it's such an ethical gray area but i

1587
02:39:19,240 --> 02:39:25,640
if it catches wind and it's all over social media i feel like you know we have to talk about it

1588
02:39:25,640 --> 02:39:30,200
because that's the type of thing that people would be talking about at the dinner table um but yeah

1589
02:39:30,200 --> 02:39:35,080
it's just i think we have to take the approach of how do we prevent this from happening again if it

1590
02:39:35,080 --> 02:39:39,960
hasn't already uh from the comments of you know this could have happened to a ton of sites already

1591
02:39:41,720 --> 02:39:46,280
all right uh let's get to some final thoughts and wrap it up for the night um thank you guys for

1592
02:39:46,280 --> 02:39:51,400
tuning in uh to another episode of orange launch radio and being here especially uh at the launch

1593
02:39:51,400 --> 02:39:56,360
of another console generation and especially after last week's show did not go as intended

1594
02:39:56,360 --> 02:40:01,480
um so i'm glad tonight went a lot more smooth thank you thank you um so thank you guys for

help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice but we

1599
02:40:18,120 --> 02:40:24,760
need more voices here to tell us bad jokes like no one special does uh and uh what your auto hosts

1600
02:40:24,760 --> 02:40:32,360
on um uh i almost said itunes your auto hosts on twitch go a real long way your reviews on itunes

1601
02:40:32,360 --> 02:40:37,080
are great but your auto hosts on twitch for vog network go a real long way super appreciate those

1602
02:40:37,080 --> 02:40:41,000
of you that do it i think bobby told me two weeks ago or last week that we had like 40 people that

1603
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:46,280
were doing it so that is great i really want to thank everybody who goes out of their way to host

1604
02:40:46,280 --> 02:40:51,400
the feed here so thank you so much um that's a really great way to get the word out um otherwise

1605
02:40:51,400 --> 02:40:59,400
that's that's really all i got um have fun gaming be nice to each other enjoy your systems and stop

1606
02:40:59,400 --> 02:41:04,680
trying to exploit your new systems for clicks uh just play games that's what they're for let's get

1607
02:41:04,680 --> 02:41:09,880
official final thoughts um loki i'll go to you final thought i'm just gonna be working more on

1608
02:41:09,880 --> 02:41:16,760
my game you think you'll finish by the end of the year yeah i'm hopeful that i can there's been a

1609
02:41:16,760 --> 02:41:23,400
few things that have should have been easy that aren't easy so i'm just working on getting through

1610
02:41:23,400 --> 02:41:29,320
that and then my goal is to get once i have all of the gameplay loop done that's just all creating

1611
02:41:29,320 --> 02:41:35,320
levels and that'll make it much easier level content is much easier than having to develop

1612
02:41:35,320 --> 02:41:40,680
the game systems um quick request from chat and i apologize to the podcast listeners because this

1613
02:41:40,680 --> 02:41:45,640
isn't going to be great but she hulk 10 says let's see loki's shirt we can see the part that says

1614
02:41:45,640 --> 02:41:50,440
xbox but we can't really see what's underneath it there's some iconography underneath it so yeah

1615
02:41:50,440 --> 02:41:55,800
so there's different xbox properties in here so i saw this at target the other day so they've got

1616
02:41:55,800 --> 02:42:02,600
it's uh the years war logo there's a minecraft creeper master chief um helmet there's a steering

1617
02:42:02,600 --> 02:42:09,720
wheel which i'm assuming is forza orie and a treasure chest which i'm sure has to do with their

1618
02:42:10,200 --> 02:42:11,080
sea of thieves game

1619
02:42:13,720 --> 02:42:17,400
so it was just some like it was a it was on sale at target so i just picked it up

1620
02:42:18,040 --> 02:42:28,840
that and i also have one for a um uh maru chan ramen shirt so i got that as well love it all

1621
02:42:28,840 --> 02:42:32,280
right uh i don't really have a lot of extra final thoughts i think i just kind of got it out there

1622
02:42:32,280 --> 02:42:40,120
like um have fun enjoy games uh i know this is a really crappy time with covid putting people back

1623
02:42:40,120 --> 02:42:45,320
indoors and the holidays are going to be different from what you're used to but games are a way that

1624
02:42:45,320 --> 02:42:50,520
we can come together a little bit so um on a on a super cheesy note i'm glad you all come together

1625
02:42:50,520 --> 02:42:55,000
with us every sunday night and um spend time talking about games with us i mean that it's not

1626
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:59,400
just a cheesy statement i really do so i think on that note we'll go ahead and roll the credits for

1627
02:42:59,400 --> 02:43:04,600
real thanks everybody have a great week and we'll see you in seven days to talk about more games
