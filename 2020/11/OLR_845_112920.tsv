0	14520	This week, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has nice things to say about Sony's design and ingenuity,
14520	17800	a nod to the Wii, and doesn't mince words on toxicity and tribalism.
17800	20880	There's being competitive, and then there's being abrasive.
20880	24520	Every console, game, remaster, re-release, online service is just a matter of choices
24520	27840	by the creators, and those choices don't necessarily make sense to anyone else not
27840	29040	part of the process.
29080	32880	Joining Phil's words come the words of your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki,
32880	35880	about this and the rest of the week's news, starting right now in the show, where every
35880	36880	gamer has a voice.
40880	46240	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where
46240	53240	every gamer has a voice, another episode of Orange Lounge Radio starting right now here
53240	58200	live at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network where we do tape live every
58360	62040	Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf
62040	63040	show.
63040	68320	It is episode number 845 for this November the 29th of 2020.
68320	69840	My name is Rob Roberts.
69840	73320	Not joining me tonight sadly is Dark Sakura or Jamie Sommers.
73320	78160	She is off for tonight because it is her husband Dan's birthday, and they are doing birthday
78160	83440	things, you know, things that you can do in quarantine outside with friends and stuff,
83440	88040	but taking the night off to be with her hubby on his birthday, and hope they're enjoying
88040	89040	the night.
89040	94400	But joining me live, as he does pretty much every week, say hello to tech master Loki.
94400	95400	Hello.
95400	96400	Hi, Loki.
96400	97400	How are you?
97400	98400	I'm doing fine.
98400	99400	Did you have a good Thanksgiving?
99400	100400	Yeah, it was busy.
100400	101400	I cooked dinner.
101400	102400	So that took like six hours.
102400	103400	Turkey.
103400	113880	So yeah, it was like turkey mashed potatoes stuffing, glazed carrots, creamy casserole
113880	116880	and giblet gravy.
116880	117880	Oh, wow.
118720	119720	Wow.
119720	120720	So yeah.
120720	121720	I never cooked for turkey before.
121720	122720	So that was fun.
122720	126760	And Thanksgiving was different for a lot of people this year, I think, because of everything
126760	127760	going on.
127760	132000	Was it just you, your immediate household, or did you go over to like Nellie's?
132000	133000	Oh, okay.
133000	135000	I thought maybe you would have spent time with the wife's mom.
135000	140240	I mean, I did go over to her parents house to drop off some food after we're done, but
140240	143360	yeah, the drop off thing is big too.
143360	147480	I think a lot of like, I know some families were doing like Thanksgiving to go and things
147480	148480	like that.
148480	151960	So obviously, we had a very scaled down year.
151960	155560	We usually don't do anything, especially ever since my mom passed away, which about three
155560	161320	years ago, Thanksgiving has been pretty low key, but it was just myself, Alan and my dad.
161320	163880	And we knew we'd have to mix with my dad.
163880	168000	And that's why, you know, in the weeks leading up to it, I was very careful not to go out
168000	169440	and do anything irresponsible.
169440	174700	And ironically, I ended up having another COVID test on Monday, because I woke up Monday
174700	177860	and I was like, I'm playing the new 2020 game.
177860	178980	Is it allergies?
178980	179980	Is it COVID?
179980	180980	I don't know.
180980	185660	So it turns out it was allergies, at least according to the test.
185660	187660	So that made me feel a lot better actually.
187660	192660	And we did the outdoor dining thing, but it felt comfortable.
192660	197260	Like I know that's a little bit nervous because in some places it can still be pretty packed
197260	198260	together.
198260	201540	But the nice thing is a lot of restaurants out here in suburbia, at least the outdoor
201540	205140	dining is really space because they took over half the parking lot because all the
205140	206660	other places are closed.
206660	210180	So half the parking lot is their tables and they're like super spaced out and it was really
210180	211180	nice.
211180	215440	So that was nice.
215440	218880	So it was just us, small Thanksgiving, but I'm totally okay with that.
218880	221980	So I hope all of you out there had a great Thanksgiving as well.
221980	225880	And, you know, despite the fact it was probably a little different this year, if you did go
225880	229900	to a big family thing because you couldn't get out of it, I understand how the family,
229900	232620	I know I kind of went on a rant at the end of last night's show, but that was for people
232620	234260	who were flaunting it.
234260	237860	I understand some people have no choice and they may have had to go to the big family
237860	241700	thing against their will because family pressure kind of stinks sometimes.
241700	242700	Totally get that.
242700	248060	And, you know, hope you're able to spend some time alone in quarantine over the next week
248060	249380	and a half.
249380	252540	Plenty of video games available to help you pass the time.
252540	257340	Plenty of fine podcasts and broadcasting just like ours out there to help you pass the time
257340	258740	as well.
258740	265060	At least the nice thing is about the world situation in the year 2020, as opposed to
265060	269780	the year 1920 or really more like 1918.
269780	273860	There's much more to do online and things you can do in your house, right?
273860	275700	So yeah, it's nice.
275700	279900	Have you been able to, I'll get into our gaming week soon, but you know, since it is a long
279900	284820	weekend and I imagine you didn't work Thursday, Friday, like a lot of people with the typical
284820	289020	nine to fives, which by the way, thoughts are with all of our friends in the retail
289020	292460	sector who did not get the days off back to back.
292460	297500	Hope you, I heard it was like, I didn't see the fistfight videos and all that stuff.
297500	302380	Unfortunately there was a shooting at the mall here, but that seems completely isolated
302380	304460	from the fact that it was Black Friday.
304460	307620	I hope everybody out there in the retail world, I hope y'all made it through okay.
307620	311460	Cause I'm sure it wasn't easy this year, but I know a lot of folks, office jobs had the
311460	313200	Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday off.
313200	317560	And I was thinking, wow, Loki, that might be a lot of time for you to work on your game.
317560	319800	Was it a good, was it a good crunch time for your game?
319800	323040	Yeah, it was, it was, it was fun.
323040	324680	So I got a lot done.
324680	328960	A lot of the code stuff I needed to get done is now done now.
328960	338360	So I've been lately working on just art and music stuff to go in to, I just padding up
338360	339360	what I had already.
339360	348600	Cause I have like art and music and sound effects already, but it's just, I needed more.
348600	349600	Interesting.
349600	352080	Do you think you might, when do you think you're going to be ready to unveil this?
352080	353800	Do you think it might be ready next week?
353800	356440	Cause you don't know about this, but I'm about to announce something a little later in the
356440	357440	show for next week.
357440	363080	I mean, I mean, hopefully soon I, I, I know I said I wanted to get it done this year.
363080	366680	So I'm like, I'm really like every day.
366680	374960	So like I, I, I, I, I, I'm hoping very soon, but like, like I don't want to, I don't want
374960	379080	to put out a yellow text or yellow background tweet or anything.
379080	380480	So, you know, I get it.
380480	381480	No, it's admirable.
381480	382480	It's admirable.
382480	386160	And no, that's good because you know, with time to car, you were kind of showing a little
386160	391000	bit of the detail and then you were like, eh, he kind of got rid of it.
391000	392400	So that was a whole different thing.
392400	395960	So that, yeah, that one, it was, it was work working on it.
395960	401400	And then, um, it just like, I, I kind of went the wrong way with that.
401400	406800	Like I did all the art stuff and kind of got bad, but then it wasn't fun.
406800	409840	So that was the problem was like, why am I working on this?
409840	416520	If it's not really that fun to play and then it just kind of like lost the, the, the idea
416520	417520	for it.
417520	420520	And then, you know, now, uh, you know, what the golf came out and that's basically the
420520	423200	game anyways, you know, the driving stuff is kind of like that.
423200	425560	So all right, I'll need to make that.
425560	428920	Well, I'm excited to see whatever it is you have in store whenever you're ready.
428920	434040	I do think it's admirable that you are waiting until like your releases penny.
434040	436720	I think sometimes in the games industry, we wish it was this way.
436720	439920	Like don't show it off until you're ready to go.
439920	442920	We understand there's gotta be hype, there's gonna be pre-orders and things like that,
442920	447560	but you know what, at least when you announced just before you release, it's like, you know,
447560	448560	it's coming, you know, it's done.
448560	449560	There you go.
449600	455120	At least just like, yeah, just to where I know that, like, I have a momentum to where
455120	456520	I should be able to get it done.
456520	461440	The good news though, like as I've been posting, like kind of big updates online is that like
461440	466380	code wise, like I've hit my minimal viable already.
466380	470800	So like I have a full game loop with like, you know, I can start the game, I can lose
470800	474920	the game, I can win the game, you know, everything works as far as that goes.
474920	479360	And I got the core, like gameplay elements I wanted in there.
479360	482040	And then now it's just all the additional stuff.
482040	485240	Whereas before it's like, I'm going to add all this stuff in there and then I can't finish
485240	486400	everything.
486400	491880	So like time to car kind of helped you learn, even though literally everybody in chat was
491880	495480	telling you, don't do something like that for your first game.
495480	500720	At least you still had that experience of, I learned some things about what I did like
500720	503720	about the process, what I didn't like that you've been able to apply here.
503720	507600	And it sounds to me like, well, you, you have a, you have a done game at this point.
507600	511640	You have something you could release, but it's not up to the level you want it to be
511640	512640	at.
512640	513640	Am I right?
513640	514640	Yeah.
514640	515640	Yeah.
515640	520440	I mean, it's, it's definitely not able to be released yet, but you can play it.
520440	527480	And I'd like to say that I learned my lesson with the last game, but I didn't.
527480	532480	So like I didn't necessarily follow the best advice for that stuff, but yeah, you'll see
532480	533480	it.
533480	534480	It'll turn out great.
534480	535480	I'm sure.
535480	536480	All right.
536480	539080	I go into our chat because again, we do tape live on Sunday nights over at VOG network,
539080	543160	twitch.tv slash VOG network and Akuma JP is in chat.
543160	548400	Always love to see him saying, so is it really coming or is it cyberpunk coming out?
548400	552440	Uh, that's the, uh, the problem there.
552440	554560	Cause cyberpunk is coming out in a couple of weeks here.
554560	556840	So it's like, which will be here first.
556840	557840	That's the question.
557840	558840	Okay.
558840	563920	But like, that's going to be a huge distraction, but, um, yeah, we'll see.
563920	564920	We'll push through it.
564920	565920	All right.
565920	566920	Sounds good.
566920	571600	Uh, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic here, uh, and talk about, um, some comments
571600	575880	made by Phil Spencer, who someone I, you know, I've, I've talked pretty favorably of him
575880	582480	on the show previously, but he really is becoming a voice I like to hear from, you know, I gotta
582480	583480	be honest.
583480	587360	There's some people in gaming where I find, I don't like to hear from them as much.
587880	589760	Uh, and I, I, I'm not going to live in a negative place.
589760	594000	I'm not going to tell you who, but you can guess, um, but this is one of those people
594000	598880	I like to hear from because the more he kind of gives his insight on the gaming industry,
598880	599880	the more I like it.
599880	603400	I was just commenting to Bobby at the end of his show, you know, the gaming industry
603400	606800	has been kind of missing somebody like Reggie Fils-Aime, right?
606800	608400	Everybody loved Reggie Fils-Aime.
608400	612400	Even if you weren't always the biggest Nintendo person, like, like Loki, like kind of loves
612400	614640	Nintendo some days and doesn't love them other days.
614640	616760	And quite frankly, I feel the same way.
616760	620080	But Reggie Fils-Aime was always like, he's just awesome.
620080	623680	He's something like, like when you think of like a guy you want in the boardroom representing
623680	626040	the game, Reggie Fils-Aime is a great guy, right?
626040	630120	And that's why a lot of people have been trying to go after him ever since he retired from
630120	632560	Nintendo right now while he's on GameStop boards.
632560	637400	But the, the industry doesn't have like a big, big voice like that, right?
637400	641840	But I find that Phil Spencer's kind of becoming that guy where I'm like, I kind of think if
641840	645940	anybody should be the flag bearer, maybe, maybe this guy, I don't know.
645980	649780	But of course, there can always be several people that you can look up to and admire.
649780	655100	But Phil Spencer's definitely somebody where I'm like, I am so happy he's running Xbox
655100	659420	as opposed to before, we'll just say that, before.
659420	660720	Right, yeah, I get it.
660720	667340	And so like, this is kind of coming from an interview he did with The Verge, kind of talking
667340	673580	about just the game industry and stuff and talking about some of this negativity that's
673620	676700	in the industry, just as a whole, or even like fans of it.
676700	678820	You see it all the time when you go online.
678820	684780	I mean, even like so many articles have come out, like comparing stuff, basically, you
684780	690900	know, the, the essence of it is, you know, wanting something, wanting the opposition
690900	697220	thing to fail so that the thing that you bought succeeds, you know, that, you know, you want
697220	702300	it to look like I bought an Xbox, so I want the PlayStation 5 to fail, you know, it, which
702300	703300	is ridiculous.
703300	704540	It's, it's kind of silly.
704540	710340	I mean, especially if you're a person that purchased this, you know, your consumer and
710340	714580	not necessarily the companies buying it, it's even makes less sense for you to be concerned
714580	720220	about whether one company succeeds or fails, unless that company is EA, in which case I
720220	725140	would be hoping that the loot box stuff will fail, but that'll never, ever happen.
725140	730740	But like, it is, it's silly basically saying, you know, I, you know, he really wants to
730740	734780	kind of embrace this, you know, wanting everybody to succeed.
734780	740180	And that's why you see a lot of times online, you know, every PlayStation, Xbox congratulating
740180	741180	each other.
741180	746580	And I don't even think necessarily you hear too much about them dogging on the other systems
746580	747580	and stuff.
747580	751380	I think they're just really focused on what their systems can do and kind of pushing that
751380	752380	up.
752380	756780	It's more of the fanboys that are kind of, you know, dogging on everybody.
756820	763340	It's these type of people that like do this for everything, whether it's consoles, it's
763340	769180	politics, it's sports teams, it's anything, it's just, you know.
769180	773660	I was going to make the comparison too, that this does happen in another industry sometimes.
773660	777580	How about the gays and pop divas?
777580	781740	And I know you see it too, Loki, you've got to see this, you know enough gay guys, and
781740	787140	I can speak as one, that you see this on social media where it's like, you know, oh,
787140	791580	Katy Perry, she's basic, screw her, you know, hope she's a flop.
791580	796220	Christina Aguilera, bionic, flop Tina, you know, like all this stuff, right?
796220	799860	And it's like, shouldn't we be lifting up all women?
799860	803620	Like shouldn't we be, you know, why does it have to be a competition?
803620	805700	Can't we be happy for all of the great...
805700	811380	I think people in, I don't know necessarily the psychology behind it, but I feel that
811420	817220	it's probably something to do with people want to feel like that they're winning sometimes.
817220	820860	And they do that maybe even vicariously through other things.
820860	826180	So whether it be sports teams, whether it be politics, whether it be, you know, even
826180	830900	game consoles or whatever, you know, back in the day when we were growing up, it was
830900	835220	Nintendo and Sega and it's like, oh, they suck and they suck.
835220	838180	There's another great comparison because I was going to ask if maybe some of this is
838180	842780	rooted in where gaming culture has come from.
842780	845740	I mean, you know, I don't have the magazines in front of me.
845740	846740	I wish I did.
846740	850420	But, you know, maybe that's a trip down memory lane we need to take at some point.
850420	854460	But like if I had some old gaming magazines, I could open them up and show you that there
854460	858900	would be these ads, giant, full page, sometimes multi-page ads that would be things like Sega
858900	865740	does what Nintendon't or you see an ad for like the Neo Geo that compares.
865740	866740	I think it was.
866740	867740	I'm sorry, guys.
868300	872020	I don't literally remember what ads they were, but there were some that would like show the
872020	877740	Nintendo fans as a baby and the Sega fans as, you know, somebody who, you know, doesn't
877740	880340	look very intelligent and so on.
880340	885420	And then it's like, but the TurboGrafx 16 or the Neo Geo has power, you know, and all
885420	886420	this stuff.
886420	889780	It's better for the price I'm paying for that stuff.
889780	896400	So yeah, this was a part of our culture that we would read a lot about in the old magazines
896440	901360	that now I think because it's manifested itself into something really gross that we've seen
901360	905200	happen on social media, you know, over the years is it's it.
905200	909480	That's why I love that Phil Spencer's kind of starting to put his foot down and say enough.
909480	911580	It doesn't have to be like that.
911580	914600	We can all be successful and root for each other.
914600	915600	Yeah.
915600	921300	And I don't I really don't get what the point is like people like dogging other people for
921300	923940	what they like in any aspect.
923940	927100	It doesn't make any sense.
927100	932700	You know, I don't know where they could derive pleasure from that.
932700	938560	I mean, maybe it's just, you know, trolling people because there's people that like trolling
938560	941980	folks for whatever reason.
941980	942980	I don't know.
942980	947900	But it is something that, you know, has gone on for a long time.
947900	950060	I don't think it's going away anytime soon.
950060	955980	But it is nice to see that at least the game companies are starting to take the stance
955980	960660	of like, maybe we shouldn't get down in the mud with all of those people.
960660	964140	Maybe we should just take the high road here and just do that.
964140	966100	Not to say that everybody has done that.
966100	972060	I mean, just a few years ago when Sony was doing this silly video about sharing games,
972060	973060	which is fine.
973060	974740	You know, that's a legit dig, I guess.
974740	977380	I saw that more as shade.
977380	982460	So now let me steal something else from my gaze, all right?
982460	986240	So that video felt more like shade to me.
986240	989600	And there's this old quote from RuPaul, and whether you love her or hate her, she's got
989600	990980	some catchy quotes.
990980	996980	And there's this great quote from RuPaul where it is, throwing shade takes creativity, being
996980	998500	a bitch takes none.
998500	1000080	And that's the quote.
1000080	1006180	And I think when you look at those Sony commercials, they were shady, and they were creative, and
1006180	1011020	they were making a point based off of what a lot of people in the industry were really
1011020	1015980	frustrated with, which was the direction that the Xbox One was going in at the time with
1015980	1019660	the TV, TV, sports, sports, always online, no training, you know, and all the stuff that
1019660	1022540	people didn't like about the Xbox One.
1022540	1027500	But being a bitch is what I see in the comment section whenever Microsoft makes a tweet or
1027500	1028940	Sony makes a tweet.
1028940	1032260	And you've all seen it, because you all know not to read the comment section.
1032260	1035620	I just see a bunch of uncreative bitches.
1035620	1036620	That's what I see.
1036620	1037620	Yeah.
1037620	1039740	And it's people complaining about stuff that's ridiculous.
1039740	1045300	Like you're looking at game specs and like, well, this one, you know, the frame rates,
1045300	1051420	you know, it's not 120 frames per second in this game, and this one, the wall doesn't
1051420	1056340	have the fun adaptive triggers, because Sony's got that on their DualSense, so therefore
1056340	1058660	the Xbox controllers suck.
1058660	1064580	It's like, it's just stupid petty arguments, like, what are you, I don't know what you're
1064580	1066300	trying to do like that.
1066300	1070460	That's a debate you can have if you're deciding like, hey, I don't know which console to get
1070460	1074120	and you're asking your friends, you know what they recommend or what you think, you know,
1074120	1076340	you have your advantages and your disadvantages.
1076340	1080100	And if it ends up being some popular thing, like say those adaptive triggers are super
1080100	1085460	popular, then guess what the next console that comes out is going to have those things
1085460	1089420	because it's the same thing with like the rumble, you know, the HD rumble thing that
1089420	1092580	was a popular thing that was in the Joy-Con.
1092580	1093580	So what did Sony do?
1093580	1094580	They did the same thing.
1094580	1097500	I mean, they've done it before with like motion controls.
1097500	1103660	They like to copy Nintendo, but it's just, it's a neat innovative thing, but let's just
1103660	1104820	see how it's being used.
1104820	1108780	I mean, there was a thing that they were touting before, which I still have it, like I said,
1108780	1113660	I'm pretty new to the Xbox One stuff, but they were touting, you know, the rumble that
1113660	1117700	was in the triggers before it was supposed to be like some immersive thing.
1117700	1121500	I haven't noticed anything yet, but then again, I haven't played any games like that.
1121740	1122740	They have that.
1122740	1125220	So I don't know if that's just all hype.
1125220	1129340	I mean, same with the motion controls they were talking about before with the, you know,
1129340	1131380	the six axis, that was supposed to be a big thing.
1131380	1132820	We don't really see a lot of it.
1132820	1136460	And sometimes, Loki, it's all a marketing thing too, not so much in the case you're
1136460	1141380	talking about, but my brain went to when Sega had blast processing.
1141380	1146940	Remember when that, that was fucking made the fuck up, like that was a marketing thing.
1146940	1150660	And so it's, it's, it's, it's, it's like talking about, what is it?
1150660	1151660	Terra flops.
1151660	1153900	Oh, this console has more teraflop.
1153900	1157280	Do you even like, and this is what I want to ask these people on Twitter.
1157280	1160700	Do you even know what a teraflop is?
1160700	1161700	You teraflop?
1161700	1168300	Well, that's just teraflops or something that like, that's just, it wasn't a literal, it
1168300	1169300	wasn't a literal question.
1169300	1170300	No, no, I understand that.
1170300	1176300	But like, I think that they, it's, it's something that I see when I watch a lot of tech reviewers
1176340	1181620	and stuff, they use that as a point to kind of compare the power of the system, the potential
1181620	1182780	power, I guess.
1182780	1187280	But like, even now, like when they're saying, Oh, like people declaring that, Oh yeah, Sony's
1187280	1188620	won the race already.
1188620	1191060	Like literally a week or two after the console is launched.
1191060	1196580	And we're talking about launch games that, you know, probably don't know how to utilize
1196580	1198440	the hardware the best anyways.
1198440	1199740	And we're already drawing distinctions.
1199740	1203220	Oh, well, it's over for Microsoft or it's open for Sony.
1203220	1205600	Like, dude, it is way too early.
1205600	1209400	We haven't even seen the potential for these games yet.
1209400	1214740	And you're already trying to, you know, call the, you know, call the results of the race
1214740	1217160	here, which there really is no race.
1217160	1219640	It's just something to keep you busy, I guess.
1219640	1220640	Okay.
1220640	1221640	You're 2020.
1221640	1222640	Let me get to some chat comments.
1222640	1224720	Cause you guys are lighting up in chat and I love it.
1224720	1230240	At twitch.tv slash vlog network, Phoenix 77 26 describing a teraflop says it's what my
1230240	1233960	fat butt makes when I cannonball of a high dive.
1233960	1234960	Same.
1234960	1240800	My friend, same quest buster says teraflop equals how many pancakes are flipped per process,
1240800	1243320	but how many bunnies are carrying the pancakes?
1243320	1245440	That's what I want to tear a bunny.
1245440	1250460	Bobby Black Wolf says, I mean, really George Plimpton's Intellivision ads were the original
1250460	1255780	console war Intellivision once again, making history he'd have Intellivision baseball and
1255780	1259960	Atari 2,600 baseball and say, which one would you rather play?
1259960	1264720	Or once you compare, you'll know, and I remember those ads too.
1264720	1269040	So Intellivision is to blame for all this and how ironic that the Amico is now the family
1269040	1270040	friendly console.
1270040	1271040	Right.
1271040	1272040	How ironic.
1272040	1273040	Anyway.
1273040	1279060	Um, and black, black and Pat in chat says, why does it have to be over for anyone?
1279060	1280060	Great question.
1280060	1284460	And let's talk about the Amico for a second because there's a ton of people out there
1284460	1291840	already canceling this device because it's not, you know, it's, it's not there to answer
1291840	1298220	to the PlayStation five or the Xbox series X, but it's existing to its own thing.
1298220	1299220	It's a risk.
1299220	1300220	Yeah.
1300220	1302980	And some people say it as a risk that could go to a good place and some people say it's
1302980	1303980	a risk.
1303980	1304980	It go to a bad place.
1304980	1312620	It's a risk, but can't we hope it is if the Amico is a runaway success and sells millions
1312620	1313620	of Amico's.
1313620	1315860	You don't know, you, you don't know until it happens.
1315860	1318660	Is it, is it going to hurt the industry?
1318660	1322500	If the Amico is a runaway success, is that a good thing or a bad thing?
1322500	1327380	Because I would say the Ami you, you should want the Amico to succeed.
1327380	1331600	You should want all of these gaming devices to succeed because that more competition is
1331600	1333200	going to create better games.
1333200	1337320	Those more avenues to have games to play is going to make for better games.
1337320	1341300	Having a device which, you know, allows more gamers is going to make for a better gaming
1341300	1343260	culture and so on and so on.
1343300	1345020	Loki, I'm sorry, you wanted to comment.
1345020	1346020	No, no, no.
1346020	1348940	I was going to say like, I was thinking before with the Amico, I don't think it's going to
1348940	1354900	hurt the industry, but, and it's as much as I love Tommy and the whole team that he's
1354900	1360540	assembled to put it together and the Amico looks like a nice piece of hardware.
1360540	1364340	The games are a little sketchy looking right now.
1364340	1368180	They just, they, they, they come off and I know it's probably underselling it.
1368180	1374900	They come off just as small, which is, it's, it's a bad connotation cause there's great
1374900	1375900	mobile games out there.
1375900	1378940	And that doesn't mean anything about how the games are actually going to play.
1378940	1380420	Cause let's look at Wii Sports.
1380420	1385540	That that game was basic as hell, but it's still, it was a great game.
1385540	1390020	And so you can't really necessarily judge stuff by the games, but the problem it like
1390020	1398060	it just, a lot of this seems like Ouya and I know it's definitely different than Ouya,
1398060	1401860	but it's just like that, like getting excited, this is going to be revolutionary.
1401860	1404620	And they just like flops hard.
1404620	1408420	That's not to say that just because one did that this one's going to, it's just, that's
1408420	1416420	the kind of, I see it in that going that way right now, but that's not to say that they
1416420	1418220	could easily prove me wrong.
1418220	1425340	And it's just, that's my, my healthy skepticism right now about it is, is I want them to succeed,
1426340	1429580	It's okay to have the healthy skepticism because we do love this.
1429580	1431500	And I've talked about this a million times on the show.
1431500	1435100	I'll say it one more time because you never know who's listening for the first time this
1435100	1436100	week.
1436100	1439900	But even when we are critical about things in the industry that we really love, like
1439900	1441740	Nintendo, right?
1441740	1444040	We're critical because we are fans.
1444040	1445540	We want to see them do well.
1445540	1449580	So when they make these moves that we don't understand, that's what can be frustrating.
1449580	1454700	But any criticism we make on this show does come from a place of wanting to see them succeed.
1454700	1457100	And I think a lot of that is true about Amico as well.
1457100	1461620	And there was a great comment in chat that said, um, uh, as Joe and Hunter Matt says,
1461620	1466400	thankfully gaming success stories have come in the form of indie games breaking through.
1466400	1469200	And that truly is all the Amico needs.
1469200	1474220	If the Amico has that great indie partnership we don't know about yet and gets that breakthrough
1474220	1480020	indie game, it won't, all that other stuff you're concerned about won't matter.
1480020	1481340	You know what I mean?
1481340	1482340	It's great.
1482340	1486760	Having like these packing games and stuff, they're really trying to capture that whole
1486760	1491420	Wii sports market, which it's really, there's no market right now.
1491420	1492420	Let's be honest.
1492420	1498820	I mean, they sorta kinda, I mean, you didn't really, the Switch was popular, but it's not,
1498820	1501020	it didn't have that like breakthrough success.
1501020	1507940	I think like the, the weed is far as in the sense of like catering to non gamers.
1507940	1511860	Um, I granted, there's probably a lot of people that own the Wii that probably now
1511860	1519140	have a Switch, but it's not bringing, I think a ton of new, uh, gaming, uh, people that
1519140	1525060	are going to be into gaming now, um, with this, this isn't, you don't have a Wii sports
1525060	1527660	per se on the Switch right now.
1527660	1533460	Um, but I think that this could do well, especially if it's, you know, priced, you know, right.
1534460	1535740	That'd be interesting to see.
1535740	1538180	I am curious to see how stuff turns out on there.
1538180	1540860	Um, let, let me, let me bring up some, let me bring up something else.
1540860	1541860	Sorry.
1541860	1545620	Cause I, I didn't, I didn't want to turn this into the Amico hour, but let me take another
1545620	1549260	gaming device that I've been highly critical of on this program.
1549260	1553500	And I want to explain why and where I'm actually secretly rooting for it to be successful.
1553500	1558060	And that would be Google Stadia, I think is a very appropriate thing to address as, um,
1558060	1559960	I would love if this was a success.
1559960	1562740	I just don't think it's going to be in its current form.
1562740	1567240	And a lot of it has to do again, I think a lot of it is, it's just, it's just too soon.
1567240	1571860	And there's that real concern that Google is going to walk away from it just in time
1571860	1576120	to see, you know, for, for the, the rest of the industry to finally catch up to where
1576120	1577840	we need something like Google Stadia.
1577840	1580640	And a lot of it has to do with these bandwidth caps, right?
1580640	1582360	You know, there was a story going around this week.
1582360	1585300	I don't think it made our show roll tonight, so I'll talk about it real quick here.
1585300	1590760	Um, Google Stadia was showing off that cyberpunk can run in 4k and it looks really good.
1590820	1594220	But my response to that is, that's great.
1594220	1599080	But now on the other hand, you just had a story come out that said, guess what, Comcast
1599080	1604760	is bringing in those 1.2 terabyte caps to the, to the entirety of the Northeast and
1604760	1608800	every place that didn't have a bandwidth cap before is now going to have one.
1608800	1613360	And so it's like, that was a really shitty yin to the yang of the other story.
1613360	1620120	So honestly, Google, if they were really smart, would be putting a lot of pressure on a company
1620120	1627260	like Comcast to either make, I think a lot of us would really hate to see things go here,
1627260	1632000	but I think we all know the possibility is it could, to make Stadia bandwidth an exception
1632000	1633000	to the cap.
1633000	1634000	I know.
1634000	1639160	Well, I hate saying it, but it could happen or pressuring to get those caps raised.
1639160	1646440	So one nice thing about January 20th, um, with the new president coming in is that a
1646440	1650840	G Pi is buh-bye from, you know, the FCC.
1650840	1652400	That's true.
1652400	1656560	So that, that, that brings me all sorts of hope because screw that guy.
1656560	1657560	Yes.
1657560	1658560	No, screw that guy.
1658560	1659560	Don't let the door hit you.
1659560	1661480	Um, but, uh, yeah, yeah, you're right.
1661480	1664560	That'll be, that'll be interesting to see what happens with all that.
1664560	1669400	Um, so, uh, let's see, and what else I want to say about Google Stadia and yeah, putting
1669400	1674760	the pressure on like, you know, Comcast to hopefully increase or at least kind of negotiate
1674760	1681440	because you know, Comcast likes to say, Oh, well only 5% of people go over that bandwidth
1681440	1688660	cap, but when you're Google Stadia and your target is that 5% or that, that group that's
1688660	1692360	right at that cap, you know, it's, it's rough.
1692360	1697160	So I just, yeah, I, I, I do think, and I've, I've said this on the show before too.
1697160	1703280	I do think the thing that will finally light the fire under Comcast, but is going to be
1703280	1708480	the more wide adoption of 5g and that's coming in the next few years.
1708480	1711600	But 5g is pretty damn fast, right?
1711600	1715320	So as 5g becomes available in more and more places, there's going to be people that are
1715320	1719200	like, you know what, I've got an unlimited plan on my phone.
1719200	1720800	You know, fuck this Comcast thing.
1720800	1725480	I'm going to download the games through my tethered phone 5g connection, which I know
1725480	1730040	sounds ridiculous now, but did you think 10 years ago we'd even have what we have here
1730040	1731520	with these phones?
1731520	1734000	And that's going to be what it looks like in the future.
1734000	1739720	But even with 5g though, even if on those unlimited plans, it's not unlimited 5g, it's
1739720	1745220	you get so many gigabytes at 5g and then everything is throttled after that.
1745220	1747280	That's how they work on most of these cell plans.
1747280	1750320	It's not going to be the full speed for the full unlimited.
1750320	1753240	They all have caps.
1753240	1758320	But like really like if that their argument is that, Oh, only 5% of the customers hit
1758320	1759320	that cap.
1759320	1768120	I mean, really there's no different, it doesn't cost them any more money to be able to have
1768120	1770640	no bandwidth caps at all.
1770640	1771640	It's just,
1771640	1777540	And they got rid of it for three months in response to the pandemic and just to bring
1777540	1778900	it back.
1778900	1784560	They're getting rid of it because they're adding it back in is because they're not making,
1784560	1787520	they're losing sales in their cable subscriptions.
1787520	1790840	And that's the problem is they need to make that money up somewhere else.
1790840	1791880	And that's what they're doing.
1791880	1795960	And on top of that, they're also raising prices across the board anyways, next year and as
1795960	1801240	they do every year, even though they don't provide me with any other service or whatever,
1801240	1804620	they just raise the prices each year.
1804620	1809240	But that's what you get when you have basically a monopoly in the company or the country,
1809240	1810720	each of these capable.
1810720	1817080	And that's why I think 5g is going to finally, I think start to inch its way in on that monopoly
1817080	1820760	because there will be other ways to get your internet in your house.
1820760	1826760	And 5g, I mean, hypothetically, you could just have a 5g antenna and wire your house
1826760	1827760	that way.
1827760	1832200	Like, I know these things I say sound like ridiculous because we don't know them yet.
1832200	1833200	But why couldn't they?
1833200	1837020	Why couldn't you have a company that sells 5g internet?
1837020	1841880	They have that in midtown Sacramento, but like, and I keep asking them like when Verizon
1841880	1845520	comes out there, Oh, yeah, who do you have for your internet and I'm like, I've got you
1845520	1846520	for my mobile.
1846960	1854520	When are you going to get 5g and part of the team are like, well, I'm like, dude, like,
1854520	1858400	I would switch if you just brought me the service.
1858400	1860860	It's just, it's miles down the road.
1860860	1862240	Can you please just bring it to me?
1862240	1863240	I mean, I don't know.
1863240	1864240	All right.
1864240	1868160	We got off the original topic of the Phil Spencer comments on toxic fandom, but that's
1868160	1869160	okay.
1869160	1870160	Tangents we love here on this show.
1870160	1872720	And it's all about where the gaming industry is currently at.
1872720	1876260	But to loop it back a little bit, I will just say, you know, I'm happy to see that Phil
1876260	1879500	Spencer is kind of making these comments and is really kind of pushing the industry
1879500	1885760	to a, together we are stronger type of place than a, you know, fuck that guy and fuck this
1885760	1886900	guy type of place.
1886900	1890940	Like we're in our own little, I just think, you know, working together because again,
1890940	1895340	in the games industry, you've got people that will leave one company for the other and vice,
1895340	1896420	you know, and all this stuff.
1896420	1897940	I think it's going to be a healthy thing.
1897940	1903020	And that's why I'm very happy that Phil Spencer is bringing some positivity to gaming.
1903020	1904020	It's okay.
1904020	1906040	You can have positivity in the gaming industry.
1906640	1907640	It's a fine thing.
1907640	1909160	It's going to work out fine.
1909160	1911720	So all right.
1911720	1913000	Some other comments in chat.
1913000	1917600	Tiger Claw talking about the innovation and stuff saying that Elon Musk has that Starlink
1917600	1920400	internet service he's been testing out in some places.
1920400	1921400	So you're right.
1921400	1925720	There might even be other types of technology that are going to bring internet to your home.
1925720	1929640	Some things we haven't even thought of yet or are still, you know, in the planning stages.
1929640	1935200	Black Compat in chat says, if Verizon Fios came to my area, it would be over for Comcast.
1935200	1936200	Yeah.
1936200	1939480	I keep waiting for that, but that's only on the East Coast.
1939480	1940480	Yeah.
1940480	1942600	So it's just a matter of time.
1942600	1943600	It's just a matter of time.
1943600	1944600	All right.
1944600	1947520	Speaking of time and how we spend it, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types
1947520	1952040	of video games we have been playing this week as it was a holiday week.
1952040	1956320	So a good chance to catch up on the backlog over these last few days.
1956320	1959000	Although Loki may be working on your own thing, but I don't know.
1959000	1960440	How was your gaming week?
1960440	1962920	So I didn't play really much of anything.
1962920	1968240	I was trying to play a little bit of Minecraft with my kids, but they had done an update
1968240	1969380	to...
1969380	1978580	So they did a new update to 1.16 to bring parity between the Java and the Bedrock editions
1978580	1982940	of Minecraft to add some features to kind of make them in alignment.
1982940	1987980	And so they pushed a update and they hadn't pushed an update to the realms.
1987980	1995020	And so it's been really hard too, because they also added realms and server access to
1995020	1999140	the PlayStation version of Bedrock as well.
1999140	2004180	And so it just really tanked being able to connect to realms this week.
2004180	2010020	I was able to get in like a couple of times, but it was just, it was really hard.
2010020	2011660	They kept timing out and everything.
2011660	2015140	So I'm just waiting for that to kind of cool down a bit.
2015140	2019540	But I did play my realm for like a tiny little bit, just mainly testing the connection because
2019540	2023100	my kids were wanting to play, but I haven't really played anything.
2023100	2028180	I still though, I've been watching Minecraft speedrunners this week.
2028180	2032540	There's a couple of guys I watch, this guy, Danny, who he's developing this game right
2032540	2033540	now called Carlson.
2033540	2037980	So I watched him, he's a uni developer, but he's been, this entire month, he's been trying
2037980	2041920	to speedrun or become a speedrunner in the Java Minecraft.
2041920	2043060	And so that's really interesting to me.
2043060	2048300	I kind of want to do the Bedrock stuff, you know, try it because it looks fun.
2048300	2054100	And so it might be something I might try down the road and then a little bit of Orna played
2054100	2058060	that and that's pretty much it.
2058060	2061340	I didn't really play a lot of games, even those who have been perfect time to do that.
2061340	2062900	It's all game development.
2062900	2063900	That's all I've been doing.
2063900	2064900	It's just solid.
2064900	2065900	Any free time I have.
2065900	2066900	Fair enough.
2066900	2069580	Is that your brother-in-law that just joined the Orna group?
2069580	2071140	I think that's who that was.
2071700	2073700	I thought somebody related to you.
2073700	2078500	No, it's that would be, I think that's my sister's coworker.
2078500	2079500	Oh, okay.
2079500	2087300	My sister and her coworker, I think maybe her boss, they'd asked about it.
2087300	2089060	God, I'm not that, but yeah.
2089060	2090060	So they were joining.
2090060	2091060	Okay.
2091060	2092060	Yeah.
2092060	2093060	Neat.
2093060	2094060	All right.
2094060	2097040	So I had to ask, cause I was like, this person says they know Loki and they've been really
2097040	2099180	going hard on all the raid bosses and stuff.
2099220	2100220	Oh yeah.
2100220	2101220	Finally.
2101220	2107420	Like, so there was a raid boss I had popped like, God, I don't even know if it was like,
2107420	2112560	he wanted to see us in the summer and like, it's just been sitting there near my house
2112560	2115540	for like a long time and I've been just slowly chipping away.
2115540	2119460	So I finally chipped away at it and they spawned a new one and I was like, eh.
2119460	2124020	The thing that ticked me off, talking about Orna a little bit, which is, it's a GPS based
2124020	2126900	game that's very influenced by 8-bit RPGs.
2126940	2130020	And it's really impressive cause it's all one dude who put it together.
2130020	2136820	I think the music is like, you know, somebody else and some of the art assets are certainly,
2136820	2141940	you know, Loki found the pack with the art assets, but, but for the most part, you know,
2141940	2144740	it is, it's one individual that's really the kind of the backbone behind it.
2144740	2146680	So it's, it's pretty well done.
2146680	2151740	So we play that a lot and yeah, I was kind of the same thing is that I had a raid boss
2151740	2155060	just recently and it was like 7.5 million hit points.
2155220	2157180	I was like, oh, it's going to take me forever.
2157180	2158820	Finally just chipped it down and I'm like, okay, yay.
2158820	2161540	I'm going to summon a new raid boss and maybe this will be one I can get.
2161540	2162540	Yeah.
2162540	2164420	The new raid boss I spawned has 15 million hit points.
2164420	2165420	Really?
2165420	2166420	Yeah.
2166420	2167420	I got really, what is it?
2167420	2173060	The, it's the same, the raid boss I have now is also the same raid boss at this month.
2173060	2174060	So yeah.
2174060	2175060	The sisters.
2175060	2176060	Yeah.
2176060	2177060	Same, same.
2177060	2180820	And so I like, I don't know, like, cause even like the drops that they have, like I did
2180820	2184820	go up a level, but like the drops that they have, I can't really, the drops aren't great.
2185580	2186580	Yeah.
2186580	2187580	So it's like.
2187580	2188580	It'd be nice if you could pick the raid boss.
2188580	2193380	So I had these summoning scrolls and I use them somewhere, so, you know, might as well.
2193380	2194380	All right.
2194380	2195380	So, okay.
2195380	2197420	So if that's it for your gaming week, Loki, let me talk about my gaming week.
2197420	2202180	So I've been continuing on my Xbox series X, which Alan has been calling my no man's
2202180	2205540	sky machine because that's about all he ever sees me playing on it.
2205540	2209580	My save file is now up to 35 hours, just shy of 35 hours.
2209580	2213180	That's an addition to the 25 I spent on PlayStation four pro.
2213180	2215100	And that's just two of like my seven places.
2215100	2218060	So I've spent a lot of hours on no man's sky.
2218060	2221820	But obviously I've been having a great time and the world's look gorgeous and next gen.
2221820	2223500	So yeah, I've been enjoying that.
2223500	2227880	I finally went through, so I name all my galaxies with the alphabet.
2227880	2232180	So I go A, B, C, D, like all the way through the alphabet.
2232180	2234980	I even found a dessert that began with X.
2234980	2239060	I think it was called Shushio or something like that, which is a, like a treat in some
2239060	2240700	Latin American countries or something.
2240700	2247860	I even found one with X and I went all the way to Z and now I'm back at A. So I, in fact,
2247860	2249540	I'm all the way back through on my second loop.
2249540	2254660	I think I'm up to C. So, yeah, it's funny that I've been to so many galaxies on this
2254660	2256900	play that I've actually run out of letters.
2256900	2258100	So there's that.
2258100	2261860	So yeah, I've been doing no man's sky, but then I was finally like, okay, I probably
2261860	2264400	should be playing something else.
2264400	2270340	So I started to really spend some time with Ori and the, I always want to say Ori and
2270380	2271580	the Will of the Wisps.
2271580	2272820	That's the new one.
2272820	2277660	I went and played the first one, Ori and the Blind Forest, which I've started to play like
2277660	2281020	a couple times and never got very far before I got distracted.
2281020	2285740	But I made it quite a bit further this time in the Ori playthrough that I've been doing.
2285740	2289620	It is the first one because in my brain I'm like, well, I can't play the second one until
2289620	2291900	I've beaten the first one, right?
2291900	2294280	Y'all have done something similar, I'm sure.
2294280	2298900	So yeah, I've been working on the first one, the Ori and the Blind Forest.
2298900	2303140	I will say I've gotten to this part where like I got an ability I wasn't expecting to
2303140	2304140	get.
2304140	2305660	Like I was expecting to get like a double jump.
2305660	2307020	I was like, oh, how do you get up there?
2307020	2308020	You must need like a double jump.
2308020	2309420	I was expecting something like that.
2309420	2314420	I was not expecting this ability I just got where you like tie yourselves to lanterns
2314420	2319760	and use them to fling yourself through the air, but you use it with like bullets too.
2319760	2323060	And you, when you do it, you fling the bullet the other way.
2323060	2327280	And that becomes this whole other mechanic is that you have to basically use opponent's
2327280	2329680	bullets to destroy the scenery.
2329680	2331840	I got to say this about Ori.
2331840	2333300	It's a cutesy game.
2333300	2335880	It's a game that has a lot of feels.
2335880	2338560	The beginning of the game is like watching Up, okay?
2338560	2340580	That's all I'm going to say.
2340580	2343320	If you've seen that movie, you know.
2343320	2349520	But the thing about Ori for as cutesy and feely as it is, it is fucking hard.
2349520	2352880	Like you die over and over and over again.
2352880	2357080	And that's how you learn because that's how video games, you know, classic video games
2357080	2358080	really were.
2358080	2360680	So Ori, the difficulty can be really unforgiving.
2360680	2362200	Although I am playing on normal mode.
2362200	2366480	I think there is a Bobby Blackwolf mode, but I don't see how that would make it any easier.
2366480	2371160	Like it might make things do less damage and stuff like that, but some of the physics games
2371160	2373320	you have to play get really difficult.
2373320	2375720	So yeah, it's really pretty.
2375720	2381280	I haven't actually gotten a chance to play it yet, but I may have to go back and check
2381280	2382840	it out.
2382840	2390080	So let's see, SHO 100 Matt says, I got Ori and the Blind Forest when I got my Xbox One.
2390080	2391080	Still haven't played it.
2391080	2394320	Yeah, that's the thing is it was always kind of like a back burner game for me.
2394320	2396360	Well, all right, time to bring it up to the front burner.
2396360	2399920	So I finally really spent some time with it and yeah, I really enjoy it.
2399920	2402320	The game's on Switch too, which is pretty cool.
2402320	2403920	And I have some friends who played through it there.
2403920	2405360	It's also on PC.
2405360	2408640	So lots of options for you to check out the Ori series.
2408640	2414280	I'm sure the sequel is more pretty and probably harder, so I'm excited to get there at some
2414280	2415280	point.
2415280	2421040	The other game I've been playing a bit of, surprisingly actually, so I talked about last
2421040	2425520	week on the show where I kind of, I've put Ingress on pause for a little while, right?
2425520	2427960	I'm like kind of over it with that.
2427960	2433280	So I've been spending a little more time with Pokemon Go, especially in amping for the new
2433280	2435840	levels, which are supposed to hit this week.
2435840	2440320	I actually went downtown and I went downtown and I usually play with Bluetooth, but when
2440320	2442840	I was downtown, I caught by hand and spun all the stuff.
2442840	2448920	I'm up to 450 Pokeballs in my inventory, so that way when the new levels go live, I can
2448920	2454280	grind with Bluetooth and try to get the 200 Pokemon in a day that you need for level 41.
2454280	2459200	The raids are going to be harder for me than it will be the 200 Pokemon in a day, I think.
2459200	2462560	So that's something that'll be happening this week, so that'll be interesting.
2462560	2467120	But because of him spending that time in Pokemon Go, I was kind of like, well, I should check
2467120	2471520	out this Pokemon Home thing, because you're supposed to be able to transfer Pokemon to
2471520	2473060	Pokemon Home.
2473060	2477440	So I ended up kind of picking up Pokemon Shield again and just trying to go through and complete
2477440	2481920	my decks a little bit, but I've also been playing with some of the Pokemon Home transfer.
2481920	2486640	So Pokemon Home is like an app that they put out on Switch and the phone, and it's basically
2486640	2489520	just a storage for your Pokemon.
2489520	2493640	I don't understand why they couldn't have just modernized Pokemon Bank.
2493640	2497260	That's a little weird, because Pokemon Bank was the same thing on 3DS, but now they've
2497260	2498760	made it more mobile.
2498760	2500160	It's not the same thing?
2500160	2503120	I thought that they were charging for space or something on this one.
2503120	2505720	It's the same function, and yes, they are.
2505720	2508480	So you get a box of 30 Pokemon.
2508480	2510120	You can hold 30 Pokemon.
2510120	2513360	I think it'll fit more, but you can't touch them.
2513360	2518240	You can only touch the most recent 30 unless you pay, I think it's like 15 bucks a year.
2518280	2521760	I haven't signed up to pay yet, but we'll see if I make it.
2521760	2527120	So I transferred some of my shinies, because you know, some of the community days in Pokemon
2527120	2531560	Go, I have like 12 Weedles, 11 Magmars.
2531560	2533400	I don't need that many shiny Pokemon.
2533400	2536720	So I put them in Pokemon Bank, and then I transferred a...
2536720	2539840	I don't think you can move Weedle to Pokemon Shield, because I don't think it's in there,
2539840	2541200	but Magmar you can.
2541200	2545180	So I actually moved it over there, and now I have a shiny, another one in Pokemon Shield.
2545220	2549060	So it's been kind of fun like doing that and trying to fill out my decks, and I think the
2549060	2554780	thing that is interesting about Pokemon Home compared to Bank is that Bank was just that.
2554780	2556780	It was a storage dump for your Pokemon.
2556780	2558060	That's all it really was.
2558060	2563700	Home has like little achievements in it as well, like you store this many Pokemon, and
2563700	2568100	it has some trading that's built right into it as well, so you can trade direct from Pokemon
2568100	2569100	Home.
2569100	2570100	So that's interesting.
2570100	2574980	In fact, I should check, because I put some Pokemon in Wonder Trade earlier.
2574980	2581860	I put like a Mankey and like a Shellder that I caught, an extra one in Pokemon Shield and
2581860	2582860	something else.
2582860	2585620	One of the Rookidees or something.
2585620	2589140	So I'm actually loading Pokemon Home right now because I want to see, because I put them
2589140	2592300	up in Wonder Trade, so I'm looking, I'm bringing up the app right now.
2592300	2595300	Ooh, I got an exclamation mark in Wonder Box.
2595300	2597260	Oh, so all of my...
2597260	2599420	Oh, I wish I could show this better on the camera.
2599420	2600420	They're back.
2600420	2602060	I have three new Pokemon.
2602060	2605500	So let's see what new Pokemon I got from Wonder Box.
2605500	2606500	So the first one...
2606500	2607780	It's all trash.
2607780	2608780	It's pro...
2608780	2609940	Well, I sent trash.
2609940	2611940	So send trash, get trash.
2611940	2614060	Oh, it's a Yuri Geller.
2614060	2615060	How about that?
2615060	2617900	Haven't you heard that story this week, right?
2617900	2619180	It's one of those.
2619180	2623060	It's a Kadabra or a Yuri Geller.
2623060	2625040	So that's cool.
2625040	2626700	So I gave away a Drillbur.
2626700	2627700	That was that.
2627700	2628700	All right.
2628700	2629700	The next one.
2629700	2631300	Isn't this exciting, Radio?
2631300	2635700	To commemorate your Wonder Box trade, I've got a special Pokemon gift for you.
2635700	2637660	Make sure to get it from the gift box for mystery gifts.
2637660	2639660	Oh, I didn't know you could get mystery gifts for that.
2639660	2645340	See, that's the other reason to do it is that you get a special Mel Metal the first time
2645340	2647860	you transfer from Pokemon Go.
2647860	2653820	And then when I did the transfer from Shield into home, I got the Grookey Sobble Score
2653820	2658340	Bunny Starter Set that I guess have the special move or whatever.
2658340	2661260	So there you go.
2661260	2666180	Let's see the next Pokemon I got, because now I'm sure you're all curious, right?
2666180	2667180	Let's see.
2667180	2668180	It does this cute little animation.
2668180	2671340	Oh, a Lickitung.
2671340	2672340	One of my faves.
2672340	2675700	Oh, it's a Japanese Lickitung because it's named.
2675700	2676740	It's got the Japanese name.
2676740	2677740	Well, that's pretty cool.
2677740	2678740	Level 16.
2678740	2681260	That poor bastard got a Mankey and trade for that.
2681260	2682260	All right.
2682260	2683260	One more.
2683260	2684260	One more.
2684260	2685260	It is.
2685260	2687900	Oh, it's Alolan Vulpix, which Vulpixes are cute.
2687900	2690060	I mean, Alolans are everywhere.
2690060	2692100	Oh, another Japanese one.
2692100	2693180	So that's kind of fun.
2693180	2696380	That guy got my level 60 Shellder and trade for that.
2696380	2697380	So that's neat.
2697380	2698380	So there you go.
2698380	2699380	That's Pokemon Home.
2699380	2702180	You can do some interesting stuff in that.
2702180	2705440	And actdeftinchat says, yeah, there are goals for doing stuff in home.
2705440	2709340	And if you complete the Pokedex, you get a special Magurna.
2709340	2710540	I hope I said that right.
2710540	2711540	So yeah.
2711540	2714100	So you get little like incentives and then there are things you can kind of transfer
2714100	2715260	back into the game.
2715260	2716260	So I don't know.
2716260	2719880	I've just been kind of like a little more interested in Pokemon.
2719880	2721840	What else am I going to do right now?
2721840	2723800	All this.
2723800	2725520	Oh, Magurna.
2725520	2726520	Sorry.
2726520	2727520	Magurna.
2727520	2730520	So what else am I going to do right now with everything that's going on in the world?
2730520	2732440	So yeah, that was my Game of the Week.
2732440	2733520	Added in some Ori.
2733520	2734520	Did some Pokemon.
2734520	2736880	Oh, Final Fantasy XIV as well.
2736880	2739080	My Black Mage is almost to 80.
2739080	2740800	And now I'm working on my Dragoon.
2740800	2745300	I've only got three classes to go and then I will have everything at max level.
2745300	2747040	So there you go.
2747040	2749040	That's my Final Fantasy XIV addiction.
2749200	2751480	All right, let's get into some gaming news.
2751480	2754600	First off, though, let's do some housekeeping.
2754600	2755600	This is fun.
2755600	2759160	Because I haven't told you about this, Loki, because I just found out about this about
2759160	2760160	the way.
2760160	2763640	Well, I just I just found out about this about 30 minutes forward on the air tonight.
2763640	2767360	But somebody is going to be making a guest appearance on next week's show.
2767360	2772700	Speaking of people that have been teasing games for a little while now, Loki, somebody
2772700	2778500	else who's been teasing games on this program is going to unveil their latest next week
2778500	2780000	on the program.
2780000	2783580	And if so, someone else is going to release another game before I do.
2783580	2784580	Yes.
2784580	2785580	Yes, Loki.
2785580	2786580	Yes.
2786580	2788140	So I can't win.
2788140	2794940	If you go to our pal Y Y R's website at Y Y R Games dot com.
2794940	2800540	He's teasing that next Sunday, December 6th is a Pixel Poops direct.
2800540	2802700	And let me read what it says.
2802700	2821260	Please join us during next week's Orange Launch Radio next week at 9 Eastern Pacific
2821260	2824720	for something truly moving.
2824720	2826540	You know, like your pals.
2826540	2827540	I'm moving.
2827540	2828540	Yes.
2828540	2829820	So check that out next week.
2829820	2830820	Yeah.
2830820	2832860	He's got a little something, something.
2832860	2834980	And we're going to debut it here on the show.
2834980	2838500	Look, Ubisoft won't let us premiere stuff.
2838500	2840660	EA won't let us premiere stuff.
2840660	2842060	Nintendo won't let us premiere stuff.
2842060	2844020	But you know who will let us premiere stuff?
2844020	2846720	Y Y R. So we're going to we're going to be that meeting.
2846720	2857280	And I'm excited because I'm I'm kind of curious where he's where he's putting that poop.
2857280	2860780	Is it going to be like a Xbox thing, a PC thing?
2860780	2862300	A Steam thing?
2862300	2864480	So where are you putting your poop?
2864480	2867140	So we're going to find that out next week.
2867140	2874260	Well, maybe it's going on the Wii because it had a lot of shovelware.
2874260	2875260	All right.
2875260	2878060	Bobby Black Wolf in chat is asking, where's the Bobby Black Wolf premiere?
2878060	2880460	I mean, if anywhere can premiere poop, it's Bobby Black Wolf.
2880460	2883020	You did have the Tommy interview recently.
2883020	2886980	Didn't you get an amico thing from that?
2886980	2889220	Let us let us have our poopy moment.
2889220	2890340	All right.
2890340	2891340	That's next week on the show.
2891340	2892820	I'm excited about that.
2892820	2896900	And Dark Soccer needs to be here, really, because wasn't Pixel Poops kind of like something
2896900	2902060	she just shouted off and and then Y Y R kind of ran with it.
2902060	2904780	So she really needs to be here.
2904780	2905780	Don't recall what.
2905780	2909180	Yeah, but I think it was something that she said.
2909180	2910180	Yeah.
2910180	2912100	So we're going to find out on next week's show.
2912100	2913100	Excited about that.
2913100	2914100	All right.
2914100	2915100	Let's get to the real poop.
2915100	2916480	The news of the week.
2916480	2919700	So, Loki, why don't you start us off tonight with some news?
2919700	2920700	Yes.
2920700	2924020	So Sony would say that this is a real poopy thing that you could do.
2924020	2927860	That is giving away their precious gift.
2927860	2935900	The PS Plus collection that was supposed to be the special gift to PlayStation five owners
2935900	2940260	to have at least a basic library of some PlayStation four games that are going to be compatible
2940260	2944520	with the PlayStation five you can play as an added bonus.
2944520	2946860	But what did you in grateful people do?
2946860	2951260	You decide to go ahead and sell that to other people.
2951260	2959440	So I guess what they're doing is selling the opportunity to redeem these games, I guess,
2959440	2965820	by logging into their account or logging into it in account somehow to be able to download
2965820	2971980	the games to other systems instead of actually the owner of the PlayStation five.
2971980	2977920	And so what has this what they have done now is because of this, they've started banning
2977920	2980180	accounts that are selling these.
2980180	2982960	Most of these seem to be out of Hong Kong.
2982960	2986280	Apparently they're the ones that are doing the most of this.
2986280	2993080	But still, like, how how could you give away, you know, their special gift to you?
2993080	2998040	I mean, granted, because you had it all through PS Plus already granted like, yeah, I do have
2998040	2999840	most of the stuff in my library already.
2999840	3005300	But like, I mean, where a buck can be made, people are going to try to make it.
3005300	3009900	So I'm not like, is it is it a code that comes in the box or something?
3009900	3014880	I know what what I thought it was you you sign into your account on a PlayStation five
3014880	3016580	and then it unlocks it right.
3016580	3019460	So people are paying for that permission.
3019460	3020460	Yeah.
3020460	3026660	So what they're doing is I guess it's they're allowing somebody else to sign into their
3026660	3032080	PlayStation five or they're logging in with that PlayStation five, which will then allow
3032080	3040000	them to download that to or put it in their library, I guess.
3040000	3041180	I don't know.
3041180	3046720	But apparently what they're doing, though, is they are banning folks with their they're
3046720	3057940	doing like like upwards to like a two month ban or some of them are actually making OK,
3057940	3062400	so the the folks that are actually selling them are getting permanent bans.
3062400	3066540	The people that are purchasing the PlayStation four accounts are getting two month bans.
3066540	3067700	Well, thanks.
3067700	3069780	Thanks to this story, making the rounds everywhere.
3069780	3073960	Now I've learned that if I log into someone else's PlayStation five, I should be able
3073960	3075260	to unlock this for myself.
3075260	3076260	Right.
3076800	3078960	Let's say we don't trade money, OK?
3078960	3084000	But like I go to a friend's house, let's say or let's say, you know, like Shane is a friend
3084000	3085520	of mine and has a PlayStation five.
3085520	3087560	He was on the show a couple of weeks ago talking about it.
3087560	3088920	What if it's not a money thing?
3088920	3093580	It's just, hey, Rob is visiting and logs into my PlayStation five and now he has access
3093580	3094580	to it.
3094580	3100440	Like, are we going to get banned because I went on to my friend's PlayStation five?
3100440	3101480	I don't know.
3101480	3106080	I remember we talked about this a while back with account sharing because folks are doing
3106100	3113820	that before, like they were allowing it was an issue where like you, the person that owned
3113820	3120140	the game could actually download it to a system and that any user on that system could play
3120140	3121140	it.
3121140	3122140	Yeah.
3122140	3123140	And we were having like it was a while back.
3123140	3128540	I think it was like the launch of the PlayStation four where people were sharing accounts.
3128540	3130620	You do it on the PlayStation three.
3130620	3131620	Alan and I did it.
3131620	3135900	I mean, but we were in a relationship like we shared a lot of things.
3135900	3139800	So of course we did that, but like there would be things he bought on PlayStation three
3139800	3144120	and so he'd log into my thing, I download them and now I have them or vice versa.
3144120	3147720	You know, but that, I mean, we're not selling it to each other.
3147720	3149080	Like we're in a relationship.
3149080	3150720	There's certain things, you know what I mean?
3150720	3153480	Like it's just, yes, we're going to share some things.
3153480	3158920	So what happened, what the thought is though, is it may have been that these folks aren't
3158920	3161120	necessarily sharing it with one person.
3161120	3163780	They're sharing it with a lot of people.
3163780	3164780	So like for example,
3165240	3167240	And that's, what's getting them flagged probably.
3167240	3171040	Yeah, because they're saying that the thought is it says it's believed that a PlayStation
3171040	3175360	automatically bends consoles where logs in a high number of users, user accounts in a
3175360	3178260	single day in order to protect it from fraud.
3178260	3182000	So they're thinking, I don't think it's necessarily that they're just having one other person
3182000	3184420	sign in because that's not necessarily unusual.
3184420	3188120	Like are you going to have to be in a household with two people that own two different PlayStations
3188120	3189960	and maybe you want to log into each of your own accounts.
3189960	3193920	And I think that's completely legit, but I think it's when they're having like 30 people
3193940	3194940	log into that.
3194940	3195940	I get it.
3195940	3198700	They're like, hmm, that's a little suspicious.
3198700	3202000	So Bobby in chat says, how do they know you paid money for it and what happens if I log
3202000	3203000	back into my PS4?
3203000	3204420	Well, they think I sold it to myself.
3204420	3208380	So it sounds like the trick may be, I mean, again, Sony doesn't tell us because if they
3208380	3212260	told us how they figured it out, then people would know how to go around it.
3212260	3216300	But it could be that, you know, if you've got one PlayStation five where literally a
3216300	3220720	hundred people have logged into it because the guy keeps flipping it on eBay, that probably
3220720	3222580	was a red flag for Sony.
3222580	3223580	Yeah.
3223960	3231560	But like if Bobby and his wife log into each other's devices, that shouldn't trigger anything,
3231560	3232560	you know?
3232560	3234560	Yeah, it shouldn't.
3234560	3239720	DGRMS says, plus it's probably tracked via IP address, so that's probably a big one as
3239720	3240720	well.
3240720	3246300	Like, why are all these American accounts signing into this Hong Kong based PlayStation?
3246300	3250880	Like maybe one or two, you know, because family can be anywhere, everywhere.
3250880	3251880	Right.
3251880	3252880	But not 50.
3252880	3253880	Right.
3253880	3257300	So that those are probably the types of things that are setting off red flags at Sony, I
3257300	3258300	imagine.
3258300	3259300	But yeah.
3259300	3260300	And so I don't know.
3260300	3266780	It just I mean, it's obviously they're going to catch on if it's that frequent.
3266780	3267780	Yeah.
3267780	3270740	But, I don't know, we'll have to see.
3270740	3271740	Yeah.
3271740	3274620	And how badly do we need this PlayStation four collection anyway?
3274620	3276100	Like I'm not knocking it.
3276100	3277100	I'm not knocking it.
3277100	3278100	It's a nice little deal.
3278100	3282700	And especially like if you skipped PlayStation four entirely for whatever reason, and now
3282720	3286400	you know, you're coming from a PS two or a PS three to a PS five.
3286400	3290920	It's a great thing to have because, you know, now it's like, here's everything you missed.
3290920	3292280	So it's a huge bonus.
3292280	3298280	But like outside of that, like especially for like, you know, gamers who have experienced
3298280	3300520	PlayStation four and kind of bought the big hit.
3300520	3305680	Is it that important that you've got to be logging into a PS five in Hong Kong to get
3305680	3306680	the library?
3306680	3309640	Well, I don't think it's necessarily that you're logging into a Hong Kong PS five.
3309640	3313780	I think it's just a lot of users that were in Hong Kong were doing this.
3313780	3318740	So it's like necessarily, I think across the board, you know, a lot of people could be
3318740	3322700	doing it anywhere, but it's just that there was a lot of users that they saw that were
3322700	3323700	in Hong Kong.
3323700	3324700	Yeah.
3324700	3330220	I guess those, I mean, I'm judging you Hong Kong PlayStation users.
3330220	3333740	Only the ones who sell for money, the Uber capitalist ones.
3333740	3334740	I get it.
3334740	3338300	Like it's an expensive console, but like, and you're probably thinking, well, you know,
3338300	3342760	I don't need these cause I have, you know, all these games already, it'd be different.
3342760	3347120	Like if it was like a code that was in your PlayStation five box or something like that,
3347120	3352520	and you're selling that, whereas that might be slightly frowned upon by Sony.
3352520	3357680	It's not necessarily, I think illegal to do that, but you know, being that this is tied
3357680	3363860	to your console and when any account logs in, gets these games unlocked, okay.
3363860	3370240	That wasn't the best way to do it, but you know, it's, I don't know.
3370240	3371240	Let me get careful.
3371240	3373160	Let me get some other comments from chat on all this.
3373160	3378480	Fifth dream over at twitch.tv slash vog network says this is worse than animal crossing trades.
3378480	3382720	One a shit item, 300 nook mile tickets or we kick out out.
3382720	3385640	Yes, is worse than animal crossings now.
3385640	3386640	Let's see.
3386640	3392780	Phoenix 77 26 says that's like asking how someone never me, never can share their Disney
3392800	3395400	plus account with friends.
3395400	3401000	I'm laughing because literally on Thursday I was like, Oh dad, you like national geographic,
3401000	3402000	right?
3402000	3404280	Oh, you're going to love this.
3404280	3405280	Logged them in.
3405280	3410680	But the thing is like, and these companies like Disney plus and Netflix and so on, they're
3410680	3416840	pretty transparent now with what they're monitoring because like, I think Disney allows two concurrent
3416840	3417840	streams, right?
3417840	3419200	Am I right?
3419200	3420860	It's two concurrent streams on Disney.
3420860	3424100	It's like two or four on Netflix, depending on your plan.
3424100	3427320	So it's like, they're telling you, like, if you do more than two, the others are going
3427320	3428320	to get knocked off.
3428320	3429320	Well, guess what?
3429320	3433340	Like, nobody's ever going to watch Disney, not on my big screen TV and then my dad maybe
3433340	3434340	occasionally.
3434340	3437960	So there's two, but again, I kind of think there's a big difference between you sharing
3437960	3443240	it with a family member and you're selling it on eBay to make a profit and help pay for
3443240	3444240	it.
3444240	3445240	You know what I mean?
3445240	3446240	Yeah.
3446240	3447240	Big difference.
3447240	3448240	Big difference.
3448240	3449240	So, all right.
3449240	3450240	Let's see.
3450620	3453260	200 Matt says Disney plus allows four concurrent streams.
3453260	3455140	Well then, I got two more up for grabs.
3455140	3456140	Loki, you have Disney plus?
3456140	3457140	All right.
3457140	3458140	I do.
3458140	3459140	Okay.
3459140	3460140	I don't use it either.
3460140	3461140	Moving on.
3461140	3462620	You need to watch the second season of Mandalorian.
3462620	3463620	I use it once in a while.
3463620	3465100	I haven't even starred in Mandalorian.
3465100	3466940	I need to, but I do watch Sister Act.
3466940	3472060	I watched the first season, but it's starting to get into spoiler territory with online.
3472060	3474900	So I'm thinking I have to jump into season two.
3474900	3477300	I just haven't really been motivated to.
3477300	3478300	It was all right.
3478360	3482600	It was just not like, it wasn't like the boys where I was like, I got, I got to have season
3482600	3484440	two, you know, immediately.
3484440	3486400	Whereas Mandalorian is like, yeah, I'll watch it.
3486400	3487400	It was good.
3487400	3491680	But it wasn't like, I'm like, just die hard and got to watch it.
3491680	3496240	Bobby Blackwell says four concurrent is one of the norms to allow a family with two kids
3496240	3498600	to all be streaming at the same time.
3498600	3499880	Comcast likes this.
3499880	3500880	Yeah.
3500880	3503800	There you go again with those bandwidth caps and they're, they're all watching things in
3503800	3505840	4k on National Geographic.
3505840	3508160	Then, you know, goodbye bandwidth.
3509020	3511220	You know what Comcast would really like?
3511220	3516460	For you to check out Peacock because Comcast, NBC and all that is in one big thing.
3516460	3520860	But although I have heard good things about the Saved by the Bell redo or whatever it
3520860	3522740	is, continuation series, I don't know.
3522740	3526300	It's the modern Saved by the Bell and that's all on Peacock.
3526300	3530540	But I'm kind of surprised and, you know, I maybe with net neutrality coming back, this
3530540	3531540	wouldn't really be a thing.
3531540	3535260	I'm kind of surprised Comcast just hasn't said, Hey, if you watch these things on Peacock,
3535260	3538140	it won't count towards your bandwidth.
3538160	3539160	Maybe that's coming.
3539160	3540160	I don't know.
3540160	3542480	All right, moving on.
3542480	3543840	Let's go to another story.
3543840	3549400	Let's talk about a game that many people are very fond of and still are kind of surprised
3549400	3553360	maybe because it's been so long that a sequel is incoming for this game.
3553360	3557720	It is the game The World Ends With You.
3557720	3558720	That's right.
3558720	3561080	The World Ends With You originally came out for the DS.
3561080	3562760	It's it's several years old.
3562760	3566360	In fact, I think it's old enough that dark soccer did it as classic game of the week.
3566420	3569100	I think relatively recently.
3569100	3572140	So yeah, it's it's not it's not a redo.
3572140	3575140	They already did that on the mobile devices and all that.
3575140	3576640	Not that long ago.
3576640	3580460	This is an actual sequel, new characters, new gameplay and so on.
3580460	3582500	It is called Neo.
3582500	3584220	The world ends with you.
3584220	3588420	Not to be confused with a character from the Matrix, but you will be going back into the
3588420	3593300	Reapers game as Rindo and you will team up with some new people and some familiar faces
3593300	3596020	as well to defeat the Game Master.
3596020	3600420	Everything is now in 3D, but still kind of has that similar style to it.
3600420	3606660	You will have a newly reimagined action combat system and some more answers from the previously
3606660	3607900	launched story.
3607900	3610640	This will be coming in summer 2021.
3610640	3614760	It is currently scheduled for the PlayStation 4 and the Nintendo Switch.
3614760	3618720	So no word as of now about Xbox.
3618720	3623760	Don't know if that's maybe because this announcement kind of came out of Japan where Xbox still
3623760	3625760	really isn't a factor.
3626300	3631220	Square Enix has been doing things with Microsoft because I know I'm personally hyped for the
3631220	3635340	Dragon Quest XI remaster coming to Game Pass in the next week actually.
3635340	3637860	That's probably something I'll talk about next week during my gaming week.
3637860	3641440	But that's going to be great to experience again in 60 frames a second and all that stuff
3641440	3643920	that Xbox Series X will provide.
3643920	3648860	And then like all the Kingdom Hearts games are on Game Pass too, so we don't know about
3648860	3649860	Microsoft yet.
3649860	3651180	Maybe it'll be delayed by a year.
3651180	3653780	A lot of the stuff has been.
3654480	3655760	Right now, no word on that.
3655760	3658640	It's just PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.
3658640	3662560	But you can, if you want to check out the original game, that final remix of The World
3662560	3666880	Ends With You, and I think that's the version that they did for the mobile phones and stuff,
3666880	3669080	that is also out on the Switch.
3669080	3672840	So you can check that out if you want.
3672840	3678240	ActDeftInChat says, there were also new screens of The World Ends With You anime launching
3678240	3679240	next year.
3679240	3682740	So this series is coming back in a big way.
3682740	3685960	Are you surprised, Loki, that this game is getting a sequel?
3685960	3688640	I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner.
3688640	3689640	It's always-
3689640	3696280	I never played the first one, but I'm not surprised, I guess, because, I don't know,
3696280	3698080	nothing surprises me anymore.
3698080	3701120	Well, you know what game I was surprised got a sequel?
3701120	3702120	Was Nier.
3702120	3703120	You remember that?
3703120	3707000	And that was on the Xbox 360 here, and we had kind of a different version of that than
3707000	3708520	they had in Japan.
3708520	3713980	And I remember thinking, I don't think this game did well enough to necessitate a sequel,
3713980	3719380	and then the sequel comes out years later, is a big surprise, and one of the greatest
3719380	3724880	video games of the year, and some would argue the decade, or even ever, gets released.
3724880	3726380	So sometimes these sequels-
3726380	3727380	Still haven't played it yet.
3727380	3728380	Oh, you should.
3728380	3729380	It's good.
3729380	3730380	I know.
3730380	3735980	I remember the original Nier, but other than the name, they didn't really resemble each
3735980	3736980	other.
3737220	3741740	Just throw the original Nier on 360 out of your mind.
3741740	3744760	This is a new thing, and you didn't need to play the original to understand it, and you'll
3744760	3745760	be fine.
3745760	3746760	I understand that.
3746760	3751240	I get that, but it just never- I don't know.
3751240	3757600	I'm not familiar with the universe of the original Nier to know whether or not this
3757600	3764640	was basically in the same universe, or if it's tied together other than in name only.
3764640	3771260	AkumaJP in chat says Nier has hardcore fandom, but that's also kind of a Japan versus US
3771260	3772260	thing.
3772260	3776260	Of course, that game has fandom now, but I'm talking like pre-Nier Automata.
3776260	3779700	We only had that 360 version, which I think was a completely separate game you guys had
3779700	3781020	in Japan.
3781020	3786680	That one they're redoing is brand new for us in America, which it's weird how it all
3786680	3794340	works out, but yeah, I didn't think that fandom before Automata, again, was here in the
3794340	3796140	States, but it's certainly there now.
3796140	3799880	People loved Nier Automata, and I understand- I've played enough of it to understand why
3799880	3802220	people love that game so damn much.
3802220	3805160	So great music, my god.
3805160	3807600	So yeah.
3807600	3811300	And AkDef says if you want to go full canon, Nier is part of the Drakengard universe.
3811300	3812300	That's true.
3812300	3815760	I remember hearing that, so yeah, neat.
3815760	3817400	All right, let's move on.
3817400	3820800	So that's cool that World Ends With You is getting a sequel after all this time as well,
3820800	3824780	because it has had its fans that were pretty hardcore over the years, so they're getting
3824780	3828940	rewarded in a big way, not just with a new game, but with the anime.
3828940	3832040	Who's not being rewarded, Loki?
3832040	3839660	If you bought a Wii U and you own Super Mario Maker, well, you're not going to be able to-
3839660	3846600	they're removing the course share function starting, of course, on that ever so popular
3846600	3851600	date with Nintendo removing things, March 31st, 2021.
3851600	3853860	The end of the fiscal year.
3853860	3856580	The day that they just say, you know what, Mario?
3856580	3858440	You had your 35th anniversary.
3858440	3861700	Now we're just kicking you in the pants during in the trash.
3861700	3864120	Oh, mama mia.
3864120	3866660	They're just removing everything at that time.
3866660	3874540	So apparently if you have Super Mario Maker for Wii U, the game will be removed from sale
3874540	3879140	on Nintendo eShop as well on January 13th, 2021.
3879140	3882400	Mario will be deleted on March 31st.
3882400	3885960	And then also apparently, though, they just reminding you it's not going to have any impact
3885960	3888440	on the second game.
3888440	3895320	Also Super Mario Maker Bookmark is the service on that website is also ending as well.
3895320	3900760	They say it won't be possible to look up any bookmark courses on the Wii U version of the
3900760	3902840	course world.
3902840	3908460	But you can still play, I guess, courses that were- it says it will still be possible to
3908460	3912640	play courses that were uploaded before the course upload feature was discontinued and
3912640	3915700	to redownload the game after its removal from the eShop.
3915700	3916700	Oh, thank you.
3916700	3920660	Well, that's nice that I can redownload the game that I purchased.
3920660	3927540	For now, until they close the Wii U eShop permanently, which I would be really surprised if that's
3927540	3932600	not in the next two years, I'm going to say, is that the Wii U shop goes kaput, just like
3932600	3934020	the Wii shop did.
3934020	3935700	So it's a matter of time.
3935700	3938480	And that's that's some of the problem with these online games.
3938480	3943560	I mean, it's nice that at least you can go online and still get the levels.
3943560	3946600	You're just not going to be able to add to the very large repository of levels.
3946600	3950560	And the only bummer about this, and I do understand, and Dart to see you in chat says, well, to
3950560	3952760	be fair, they did put out a sequel.
3952760	3955800	So they're probably assuming more people are playing on that now.
3955800	3956800	Correct.
3956940	3958700	More people own a Switch than on the Wii U.
3958700	3964800	But let's not forget, there were some things, not many, but there were some things that
3964800	3969640	Mario Maker first one could do that the sequel can't do.
3969640	3976420	For example, one of my levels that I did only can exist in the first game because I used
3976420	3978460	the amiibo characters.
3978460	3981060	And that's not that's probably the biggest thing that's not in the sequel.
3981060	3982840	And I wish it was.
3982840	3983840	I miss it.
3983840	3987540	Like that was that was a fun little thing in the 8-bit mode, and I don't understand
3987540	3989580	why they didn't bring that over.
3989580	3993260	Maybe it was a licensing thing with some of the extra characters, then fine, take the
3993260	3995020	non amiibo characters out or whatever.
3995020	3999460	But I'm just surprised that never made its way to Mario Maker 2.
3999460	4004100	Because otherwise, why can't they just be like, we're going to take all your original
4004100	4006860	levels and put them in the Mario 2 database?
4006860	4008540	But they can't really do that.
4008540	4011460	Yeah, it's just probably different.
4011600	4015360	And then also, there's still the 3DS version, which I think is that stuff as well.
4015360	4020000	And oh, yeah, I forgot about the 3DS version.
4020000	4021000	Whoops.
4021000	4027920	Yeah, so oh, well, yeah, um, fifth dream points out baby metal was a thing and Mario made
4027920	4028920	this right.
4028920	4031440	And dark Tetsuya talking about the licensing says, oh, that's true.
4031440	4032720	It might have been licensing.
4032720	4037600	Like I love the Hello Kitty skin lol Yeah, some of that stuff would probably be hard
4037600	4039500	to get in Mario Maker 2.
4039500	4043560	But there was also a ton of stuff that was Nintendo's own stuff.
4043560	4047340	You know, most of those amiibos are all Nintendo's own things.
4047340	4050340	So they shouldn't have had such a hard time bringing that over.
4050340	4052460	They just didn't do it for whatever reason.
4052460	4055500	Act F does point out we got the link thing in Mario Maker 2.
4055500	4058540	And that was really cool because that brought new mechanics with it as well.
4058540	4062260	And maybe that was the level Nintendo wanted new characters to be at.
4062260	4067420	But I don't know, they've kind of they've ended major support for Mario Maker 2 already,
4067420	4068420	right?
4068420	4069420	Like, yes, you can still upload.
4069420	4072760	It's not the same that you still upload levels and the community is still there and everything.
4072760	4076840	But they're, they're not planning to, like they said, the last major patch was the last
4076840	4079480	major patch, right?
4079480	4080480	Pretty sure.
4080480	4081480	Yeah.
4081480	4082480	I don't know.
4082480	4085080	It is kind of disappointing that they didn't do more with this.
4085080	4086560	I was hoping they'd have more in there.
4086560	4089280	But maybe they're saving it for Mario Maker 3 or something.
4089280	4090280	Maybe.
4090280	4091280	I don't know.
4091280	4092280	Yeah.
4092280	4097940	Anyway, so those of you that are still gaming on your Wii U, TikTok, because I don't know
4097940	4103060	what's left on Wii U that's not on the Switch or going to be on the Switch.
4103060	4105100	Everything has to be at the end of this fiscal year.
4105100	4110500	Like it's so weird that so many things are being discontinued on the 31st.
4110500	4111740	Like I don't know.
4111740	4114780	Is it some type of server cost they can write out for the next year?
4114780	4117540	I would think it would be miniscule, but I don't know.
4117540	4118540	It's weird, though.
4118540	4120260	It's just, it seems odd.
4120260	4121740	I guess we'll have to wait and see.
4122200	4123200	Oh, thank you.
4123200	4124200	Dr. Seo points out a really good one.
4124200	4126680	Xenoblade X. Real soon, I hope.
4126680	4133140	I hope that's one of the ones that they poured over to the Switch, but we'll see.
4133140	4138240	Maybe they're waiting for that Switch Pro, and then they're going to do a souped up Xenoblade
4138240	4142000	X, kind of like they did the other Xenoblade.
4142000	4143000	I don't know.
4143000	4144760	Just a crazy thought.
4144760	4148320	So Sia Tabiri suggests Earthbound and Earthbound Zero from the Virtual Console.
4148320	4153260	Yeah, it would be nice to get those games in Nintendo's new Switch system, wouldn't
4153260	4154260	it?
4154260	4155260	Hmm.
4155260	4156260	All right.
4156260	4161860	Anyhow, let's move on and talk about, so we've got old consoles no longer being supported.
4161860	4166260	How about old consoles still being supported by Natsume?
4166260	4171780	Because they are doing some rereleases, get this, on the NES and the Game Boy Color.
4171780	4177280	And when I talk about rereleases, I'm not talking about like these games now available
4177280	4185000	on the Switch, I'm talking about get an actual NES cartridge for Shadow of the Ninja.
4185000	4186000	So you can check that out.
4186000	4187000	It's a partnership.
4187000	4188000	Oh, that's cool.
4188000	4190660	Yeah, it's a partnership with Limited Run Games to actually rerelease some of their
4190660	4191660	games.
4191660	4196300	So Shadow of the Ninja, originally from the year 1990, and Return of the Ninja for the
4196300	4200180	Game Boy Color from 2001 are going to be released by Limited Run Games.
4200180	4202420	They will work on the original hardware.
4202420	4206140	So this is an actual cartridge in both cases that will work.
4206140	4210680	The pre-orders already went up, so they're probably already gone, sorry.
4210680	4212400	But that is something that happened.
4212400	4214560	So who knows, maybe there'll be more in the future.
4214560	4218120	But I just thought that was really neat that, you know, and this isn't the first, wasn't
4218120	4221160	there like a Mega Man game recently or something too that?
4221160	4222600	It wasn't too recent.
4222600	4229480	It was a while ago they did Mega Man 9, I want to say they did a physical release of
4229480	4230480	that.
4230480	4231480	Yeah.
4231480	4236780	I don't remember if they did 10 as well, but I know 9 I think was done, because they released
4236780	4241380	that in like the eShop, or not eShop, well actually it might have been the eShop actually.
4241380	4247700	All the online services, and then they also did a limited edition cart that you could
4247700	4248700	buy as well.
4248700	4254140	And then of that there was even an even more limited edition cart that was like blue or
4254140	4255140	something.
4255140	4256140	Yeah, yeah, I remember that.
4256140	4258180	Dart 2 Studio says, I thought this was cool.
4258180	4259860	I played a bit of that on Switch Online.
4259860	4261160	It was kind of fun.
4261160	4262160	Super tough though.
4262160	4266160	And yeah, that's one thing that should be called out is that this game is actually on.
4266160	4270100	It was very recently added to the Switch Online service.
4270100	4278020	So if you have the classic Nintendo Entertainment System collection as a Nintendo Online subscriber,
4278020	4280920	if you go in there, you can actually play this game.
4280920	4284580	So it is, it's really something that like in addition to that, they're still putting
4284580	4285580	it out on cartridge.
4285580	4289500	Now, I imagine they're not making a lot of them, and the pre-orders I'm sure sold out
4289500	4291540	within less than a day.
4291540	4295380	But it's neat that that market is still there for these things to be playable on the original
4295380	4296380	hardware.
4296380	4301560	Oh, and YYR actually points out that the games are actually still available, so they didn't
4301560	4304760	instantly sell out, because usually these things do.
4304760	4308640	Maybe the titles are a little too obscure for some people, I don't know, but that is
4308640	4309920	something you can get on if you want.
4309920	4313220	Or maybe they're going to print as many as get ordered, I don't know.
4313220	4315220	So it's kind of neat.
4315220	4317720	All right, let's move on.
4317720	4318720	Loki.
4318940	4324580	All right, so Fall Guys season three is obviously right around the corner.
4324580	4328860	And so the tease, what the reveal of what the season was going to be, they decided to
4328860	4330260	do something kind of fun.
4330260	4337820	They decided to split up the teaser image into a 300 piece jigsaw puzzle, and offered
4337820	4344140	it to folks on Twitter and Discord, and had them work together to try to put together
4344140	4347960	the puzzle, which they did within a few hours.
4348180	4355060	And so now it's going to be, it looks like a winter-themed Fall Guys, which I guess is
4355060	4356060	appropriate.
4356060	4358140	But yeah, it's pretty cool.
4358140	4364740	So they've got snowmen and penguins, so yeah, so that'll be coming pretty soon.
4364740	4365740	Neat.
4365740	4370380	Akdeftnchat says, I got to level 40 on season two last week, and I'm looking forward to
4370380	4371380	season three.
4371380	4374980	Yeah, Winter Knockout is what it's called, I guess.
4374980	4382240	So they don't have a date when it's supposed to launch yet, but you know, the Game Awards
4382240	4387140	right around the corner, so I guess they get a release date for that, so we'll see.
4387140	4390600	By the way, since it didn't make tonight's show roll and you brought up the Game Awards,
4390600	4396260	have you heard the most recent fan wank about the Game Awards and what's set to be announced?
4396260	4397720	I don't know if I believe it.
4397720	4401920	This rumor's been coming up too many times where it's almost becoming self-parody.
4401920	4408100	If it happens, great, but it is the Hideo Kojima Silent Hills on PlayStation thing,
4408100	4411660	and you know that's been going around for a while, and now they're saying, this is it,
4411660	4412660	it's happening.
4412660	4413660	Game Awards.
4413660	4419160	If it does, if it doesn't, I'm not going to be disappointed.
4419160	4426020	What would be really cool though, again, this is total tinfoil hat, fan wank city, this
4426020	4431160	isn't going to happen, but I'm going to say it anyway, if on the day of the game rewards
4431160	4437540	they release the PT again for PlayStation 5, because Silent Hills is happening, and
4437540	4442620	that's why Konami was holding it back.
4442620	4444620	Just saying, just saying.
4444620	4447780	It would be amazing, but it's not going to happen.
4447780	4455340	I've learned to live with a lot of disappointment in the year 2020, so I'm not going to have
4455340	4456500	my hopes.
4456500	4458400	So there's one more for you.
4458400	4459400	Yeah.
4459400	4460400	Yeah.
4460640	4463220	We'd like to think that there's going to be a Grand Theft Auto 6 announcement at some
4463220	4464220	point.
4464220	4465220	Sure.
4465220	4466220	Nah.
4466220	4467220	I, you know.
4467220	4471700	When, the game awards are what, December 10th, is that Thursday night that that's happening?
4471700	4475020	Bobby, are we doing a game awards thingy again?
4475020	4479380	Because it's, I can't believe it's been a year since the last one, my God, time flies.
4479380	4481660	This year has been crazy.
4481660	4488180	But I do remember we did a, like a thing where we watched the game awards and we live reacted
4488180	4493040	and everything, because I feel like we need to do one so that if that does happen, we
4493040	4495240	need a live react.
4495240	4496240	So all right.
4496240	4498680	Bobby says we can, so please look forward to it.
4498680	4501720	We'll do a live react thing on the 10th for the game awards.
4501720	4502720	That'll be fun.
4502720	4504280	All right.
4504280	4505820	Let's move on.
4505820	4510760	Let's talk about something that will be happening, and it's a retro thing all over.
4510760	4514360	It's another micro console because these collectibles, they're everywhere.
4514360	4516480	Capcom is doing their own.
4516480	4520780	It's a new one that they're doing, and it's going to be available for the holiday season
4520780	4521780	in Japan.
4521780	4524280	I don't know when it's coming here.
4524280	4528900	It's actually coming, excuse me, to Japan this week on December the 1st.
4528900	4531080	So maybe some folks will want to import that.
4531080	4536940	It is a tiny little Capcom arcade player, and it actually has Mega Man, the power battle
4536940	4539340	and Mega Man 2, the power fighters.
4539340	4543920	So those Mega Man fighting games that, you know, you don't, I'm sure those of you with
4543920	4547840	Mame probably checked it out at some point in your life, but you know, I don't think
4547840	4552100	a lot of people here necessarily played those games a lot, so it'll be neat that those are
4552100	4553100	out.
4553100	4554720	Well, I think they had it in those Mega Man collections.
4554720	4555720	They had the power battles.
4555720	4556960	Oh, they did.
4556960	4558260	They did, and one of them they did.
4558260	4559260	Maybe even soccer.
4559260	4564860	I remember, I never played Mega Man soccer, but I can tell you that many times at Blockbuster
4564860	4569260	I looked at the back of that and going, did I rent this?
4569260	4571520	And then I never did.
4571520	4576260	Also coming out Street Fighter 2, Super Street Fighter 2, Super Puzzle Fighter 2.
4576260	4581820	So it's an interesting kind of like Street Fighter slash Mega Man hybrid thing, but okay.
4581820	4583740	I mean, that seems pretty cool.
4583740	4586980	It's cute because it has like the whole six button design, even though it's like super
4586980	4588220	tiny.
4588220	4595400	It's going to be about $210, or if you want in yen, it's 21,780 yen.
4595400	4600180	So it's like a cross between a CRT TV and Mega Man's helmet.
4600200	4605040	Yeah, it's the folks that did the Neo Geo Mini are actually making this, and I actually
4605040	4608000	have a Neo Geo Mini, and it's cute.
4608000	4613260	So this is pretty expensive, but I'll be curious, I want to check it out.
4613260	4617920	So no word yet if it'll release here, but I'm sure that won't stop some folks from importing
4617920	4619760	it, that's for sure.
4619760	4624960	All right, let's get to the classic game of the week, shall we?
4624960	4627360	Since we're on classic games anyway.
4627360	4631300	Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, we invite Dark Soccer to step into the gaming
4631300	4636740	vault, and find a game that she thinks, hey, you brats should check out this game this
4636740	4637740	week.
4637740	4642420	It's a classic game, and you got to respect the classics, because that's how we got here.
4642420	4644100	And of course, Dark Soccer's not here tonight.
4644100	4648240	I mentioned earlier she has the night off, and I was going to try to invite somebody
4648240	4653820	on, but I didn't have a ton of notice, so I wasn't able to get anybody to fill in.
4653960	4658000	So I'm going to fill in with the classic game of the week, and do something.
4658000	4661320	I think I'd put this on the back burner a long time ago, but I went through the wiki,
4661320	4667000	and I never picked this one, and this one is kind of like an interesting sort of game.
4667000	4673400	It's an entry in a long running series that I think most people have really forgot about.
4673400	4679520	And so the game that I've picked for the classic game of the week is Donkey Kong 3.
4679520	4680520	That's right.
4681220	4683940	Not the original, but Donkey Kong 3.
4683940	4692220	This is the one that takes place in a gardening type of setup, or a greenhouse, if you will.
4692220	4698380	Whereas in the first Donkey Kong game, you played as Mario, and you were kind of going
4698380	4701700	against Donkey Kong, because Donkey Kong kidnapped Pauline.
4701700	4704060	In the second game, the tables were turned, right?
4704060	4709580	In Donkey Kong Jr., Mario was the bad guy, and you were Donkey Kong Jr. trying to save
4709580	4710580	Donkey Kong.
4710580	4715840	Well, now in this third game, you take on the role of Stanley.
4715840	4717140	Who the fuck is Stanley?
4717140	4721240	I don't know, because this is the only game Stanley ever appeared in, and Stanley's also
4721240	4726640	one of those characters that rarely gets acknowledged by Nintendo after the fact.
4726640	4732960	And I don't know if it's the reason because this game didn't catch on, at least in America,
4732960	4735480	as well as the other Donkey Kong games did, or what.
4735700	4741420	But yeah, this game was released October of 1983 in Japan, and it followed shortly after
4741420	4744260	in North America and Europe.
4744260	4748540	And it's kind of blamed that it was not the commercial failure in North America, or excuse
4748540	4752980	me, that it was a commercial failure in North America, because it came out right around
4752980	4756580	the same time that the video game crash was happening.
4756580	4763860	I'm actually not sure I really believe that, because I don't think in retrospect the arcade
4763920	4771920	industry ever crashed as hard as the console industry did in 1983.
4771920	4775120	You know, arcades kind of made it through.
4775120	4779120	And granted, there might be other things that you kind of contribute to that.
4779120	4784880	However, I think the unique nature of Donkey Kong 3 and why it's a little weird could be
4784880	4787760	a symptom of the video game crash in 83.
4787760	4793000	And what I mean by that is, this really isn't like the other two Donkey Kong games.
4793000	4794700	Now I'm highlighting it as a classic game of the week.
4794700	4798580	I think it is an interesting game, but it is interesting in the ways that it is very
4798580	4801180	much not like the other Donkey Kong games.
4801180	4804980	Donkey Kong, the original, and Donkey Kong Jr. were kind of platformers, right?
4804980	4813060	And a lot of the spiritual successors like Super Mario Brothers and Donkey Kong Country
4813060	4814980	also platformers.
4814980	4817700	Donkey Kong 3 looks like a platformer.
4817700	4818700	It's not.
4818700	4821800	As you're watching this on Twitch, can't you see?
4821800	4823680	This is a shooter.
4823680	4827780	And what you're doing is you're shooting the bugs and you're using the spray to shoot Donkey
4827780	4829280	Kong up and off the screen.
4829280	4834960	Now back to my point about why I think maybe Donkey Kong 3 in itself is a symptom of the
4834960	4842280	video game crash is that I, and nowhere in the official wiki or any official resource
4842280	4846400	that I've read does it ever say that this is the case.
4846400	4849340	This is my own speculation, okay?
4849340	4854040	I think that Donkey Kong 3 probably started off as a completely different game, a completely
4854040	4856740	different type of property or idea.
4856740	4860740	And then somewhere along the way, someone said, hey, why don't we put Donkey Kong's
4860740	4863440	face on it and it'll sell plenty more.
4863440	4866440	It'll do much better if we just slap Donkey Kong into it.
4866440	4869300	Why do you have this character climbing up the vines that's the bad guy?
4869300	4870300	We can have Donkey Kong.
4870300	4871300	There you go.
4871300	4872300	This is Donkey Kong 3.
4872300	4873300	Do it.
4873300	4874300	Print it.
4874300	4880040	Print is very much, I think a symptom of what led the industry to crash in 83 was, uh, let's
4880040	4884080	just release a video game cause we can.
4884080	4885080	So I don't know.
4885080	4888840	And again, I have nothing to go off of or anything that indicates that is true.
4888840	4892000	When you hear about the development of the game, you know, we know that the director
4892000	4896960	was actually Miyamoto was the director behind this game and that the legendary Gunpei Yokoi
4896960	4899620	was the producer behind this game.
4899620	4902040	And the music was by Hirokazu Tanaka.
4902040	4907700	I mean, this was an all star Nintendo team that put this together, but I've known Nintendo
4907700	4913020	to start something as one thing and then say, huh, maybe this should be something else.
4913020	4914300	So I don't know.
4914300	4918520	That's just, you know, again, my guess I'm taking a quick look over at our chat over
4918520	4920860	at twitch.tv slash vog network.
4920860	4921860	Yeah.
4921860	4925900	Dark Tetsuya says, um, yeah, that seems like it would have happened that way.
4925900	4930860	Uh, YYR says the later levels of DK3 feel real shmup like in the way that you need to
4930860	4932120	dodge, weave and attack.
4932120	4933120	Yeah.
4933120	4936240	Especially, and you're probably noticing as you watch on Twitch, the first couple levels
4936240	4939460	are pretty straightforward, but then it's when you get to that level where the middle
4939460	4943220	platform is kind of like half missing and you can't just jump up and shoot them off
4943220	4945240	the screen as fast as possible.
4945240	4949640	Um, you really, yeah, it becomes very much like a dodge and weave type of thing.
4949640	4952640	Uh, Questbuster says it's like Galaga with platforms.
4952640	4953640	Heck yeah.
4953640	4958180	And wouldn't this be a very Nintendo kind of way to respond to a game like Galaga and
4958180	4960840	how successful it was again?
4960840	4965140	And a Phoenix 77, 26 says, that's just a theory, a Rob theory.
4965140	4966140	Sure.
4966140	4968540	I see what you did there, but call it what you want.
4968540	4969940	But I think there's something to it.
4969940	4973780	I think this may have started as like Nintendo's kind of answer to that.
4973780	4980460	Uh, how, how cute would it be if it was bugs instead of spaceships?
4980460	4982700	And that's our answer to Galaga.
4982700	4985120	You know, it would be very similar, like Splatoon.
4985120	4989500	What if we made a first person shooter, but it was paint instead of guns.
4989500	4990500	Hmm.
4990800	4992920	Um, let's see.
4992920	4997440	Uh, and then, uh, as Joe and Hunter Matt points out, turns out Stanley is a trophy in Melee
4997440	4998840	and a spirit in Ultimate.
4998840	5002840	So, I mean, yeah, it hasn't been forgotten, but it does exist in this really weird place
5002840	5003840	in Nintendo's history.
5003840	5010880	And a lot of people, you know, you have to say Donkey Kong 3 before people go, oh yeah,
5010880	5012400	that was the weird one.
5012400	5017160	So, now I remember, so since, you know, sometimes we have personal connections to these classic
5017220	5022340	games of the week, I remember this because the grocery store of all places, talk about
5022340	5025620	things that led to the crash and, you know, video games were everywhere.
5025620	5029440	The grocery store had a copy of Donkey Kong 3.
5029440	5033860	And I remember sinking quarters into the game because it is, it is a really good cabinet.
5033860	5036500	And I love the old Nintendo arcade hardware.
5036500	5041140	Those joysticks and those buttons really have a way of snapping and clicking in a way that
5041140	5042620	not all the old machines do.
5042620	5047100	So Donkey Kong 3 was really fun to play on those old machines.
5047120	5051960	If you want to play Donkey Kong 3, there are other ways that you can check this game out.
5051960	5053960	I believe it went onto Virtual Console.
5053960	5059960	Yeah, it was on the Wii Virtual Console, 3DS Virtual Console, and Wii U Virtual Console.
5059960	5064140	Those are all available on the Wii, you know, those various systems.
5064140	5071080	It is not part of the Switch Online library, but it is one of the releases that Hamsters
5071080	5072760	Arcade Archives did.
5072760	5077080	So you know how there's like a limited selection of Nintendo games in the Arcade Archives versus
5077080	5081180	Super Mario Brothers being the most notable and the one that sold the most on the Switch
5081180	5083060	and still is in the best seller list.
5083060	5085340	Donkey Kong 3 is actually there as well.
5085340	5088380	So if you're willing to pay, you know, seven, eight bucks, whatever they're charging for
5088380	5091380	those games, you can check out Donkey Kong 3.
5091380	5096020	You know, and it's worth a look if you've never played it, but you know, it is a classic
5096020	5097340	80s arcade game.
5097340	5099180	It was a very simple loop.
5099180	5103540	So make sure you're going in with the appropriate expectations.
5103540	5106300	There is some other interesting legacy to this game.
5106320	5111440	Since the game did do better in Japan, there was actually kind of a sequel-ish type of
5111440	5117400	thing developed by Hudson Soft called Donkey Kong 3 The Great Counterattack.
5117400	5124240	It was available on the NEC PC-8801, 6601, Sharp X1, and FM7.
5124240	5127620	In other words, none, nothing that you could get here in the States.
5127620	5130640	So these were all Japanese only things.
5130660	5137340	And honestly, I've seen videos of this game, and I'm going to be honest with you, it doesn't
5137340	5138340	hold up well.
5138340	5139880	It doesn't look good at all.
5139880	5146340	Those systems used kind of like a CGA style graphics, meaning the only colors were...
5146340	5148020	It's not the cyan, magenta.
5148020	5149020	It's the other one.
5149020	5153660	I think it's yellow, red, black, green.
5153660	5156140	I think we're the only colors on those.
5156140	5157140	That's right.
5157280	5161200	You see it on the gameplay, and it doesn't look good.
5161200	5164680	You still are trying to shoot Donkey Kong up the screen, but it's like you have these
5164680	5166640	weird backgrounds.
5166640	5171120	It kind of looks like Bomberman with these weird ass backgrounds that have nothing to
5171120	5174960	do with the game, and there's no platforms anymore.
5174960	5176200	And so it's weird.
5176200	5181140	I don't particularly like it, but you can check it out and decide for yourself.
5181140	5183920	It is an interesting part of gaming's history, I will say that.
5183920	5186800	There was also a Game & Watch that was available for it.
5186800	5192380	I'm not sure to what extent you really saw these out here in the U.S., but it was included
5192380	5198480	in the Game & Watch Gallery 4 for the Game Boy Advance, but get this, they replaced Stanley
5198480	5201140	with Mario in that version.
5201140	5203180	Isn't that interesting?
5203180	5205940	This Stanley erasure, I hate it.
5205940	5208760	And then instead of the bees, you got fireballs.
5208760	5213420	So they really tried to Mario-fy the Game & Watch version, which is really interesting.
5213420	5215900	So anyway, pour one out for Stanley.
5215900	5221180	I think the long-lost Nintendo icon, although I guess there is some shout-outs in the Smash
5221180	5225640	games where you would expect to see them, but it is interesting, Stanley never did come
5225640	5226640	back.
5226640	5227640	He was never heard from again.
5227640	5230600	So there you go.
5230600	5233100	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, I did get Donkey Kong 1.
5233100	5234100	It's definitely worth it.
5234100	5236760	It has online leaderboards if you want to try for a high score.
5236760	5239000	Talking about the arcade archives.
5239000	5242060	Dark Tetsuya also says, I played a little bit of the PC port.
5242060	5244060	It was interesting.
5244060	5246840	That's a nice word to use, Dark Tetsuya.
5246840	5249740	And some folks in chat are making the joke about the Stanley parable.
5249740	5253200	Yes, I see what you guys are doing there.
5253200	5256740	And YYR says, they just Mario-fied the ball game in the new Game & Watch.
5256740	5257740	Yep, yep.
5257740	5260220	Put Mario in everything, that's for sure.
5260220	5261220	Let's see.
5261220	5266460	And SSJ100Matt with an interesting fact saying, apparently the same guy who holds the world
5266460	5270220	record for Donkey Kong holds the world record for Donkey Kong 3.
5270220	5271220	Robbie Lakeman.
5271220	5272220	Well, how about that?
5272220	5273220	Congratulations.
5273780	5278620	And that's actually especially interesting because they're not similar games, you guys.
5278620	5280740	Donkey Kong 3, I almost said Dark Tetsuya 3.
5280740	5282380	I just made you a video game.
5282380	5286400	Donkey Kong 3, again, is a shooter.
5286400	5287980	It's not really like a platformer.
5287980	5290580	So it's very interesting that the same guy holds both records.
5290580	5296900	But go back to some of those 80s icon, you know, people that were in magazines and stuff
5296900	5298420	for having all the awards.
5298420	5301660	You know, love them or hate them or don't give a shit about them.
5301660	5305460	Billy Mitchell had a lot more awards than just Donkey Kong.
5305460	5307980	He had the high score in probably some games you never heard of, too.
5307980	5311940	So sometimes those games kind of cross over.
5311940	5315700	Anyway, before I wrap this segment, Loki, did you ever play Donkey Kong 3 by chance?
5315700	5316700	I'm just curious.
5316700	5317700	I have not.
5317700	5318700	Really?
5318700	5319700	Had you ever heard of it or seen it before?
5319700	5320700	I have, yeah.
5320700	5321700	Okay, yeah.
5321700	5322700	I just have never played it.
5322700	5325980	Yeah, it's, I don't know, it's kind of one of those things where it's like, I think it's
5325980	5330300	an important part of gaming's history because it's like a forgotten game in a legendary
5330300	5331300	series.
5331940	5332940	That's why I picked it.
5332940	5338660	Didn't they have, was Donkey Kong 3, they didn't have like a, there wasn't like an NES
5338660	5340140	version of that, right?
5340140	5345900	I'm trying to remember and even though it really looks like it's on that same hardware
5345900	5349780	as the classic NES, I actually, I feel like there was.
5349780	5350780	Can you guys?
5350780	5353580	Because I can't remember if there was like- Can you live folks fact check me?
5353580	5354580	Animal Crossing.
5354580	5358140	You remember the original Animal Crossing with the NES games?
5358140	5362980	That may have been the only time that I would have actually been able to play that.
5362980	5367460	I feel like there was an NES cartridge, I mean, this game is very clearly, look at the
5367460	5371780	font, look at the look of the game, it's very clearly running on that same hardware that
5371780	5373580	powered those early NES games.
5373580	5374580	Yeah, they got an NES version.
5374580	5375580	Okay, thank you.
5375580	5379780	I was going to say, it had to exist somewhere.
5379780	5382380	But again, was it released in America?
5382380	5383500	That would be my other question.
5383500	5385060	Or was it a Famicom only game?
5385060	5391820	It's a Famicom and NES, but North America was 1983 and Japan was October 1983, so probably
5391820	5392820	around the same time.
5392820	5393820	Probably around the same time.
5393820	5394820	All right, that's good to know.
5394820	5397860	TigerKhan Chat says, this is a game that's deserving of a reboot.
5397860	5402740	I don't know if I would go that far, but I don't think it needs to be super ignored and
5402740	5407300	replaced with Mario in some of the ways that Nintendo has done.
5407300	5409740	Like, let it be what it is, you know?
5409740	5416140	So I would like to see Nintendo, why not put this game on the Nintendo library, Switch
5416140	5417820	Online library?
5417820	5419100	Why not?
5419100	5420100	So I don't know.
5420100	5422620	Or maybe there's something about it that Nintendo cares not to remember.
5422620	5425500	Maybe because it wasn't so successful in the US, I don't know.
5425500	5427900	But I remember this game fondly.
5427900	5430060	An anniversary for Donkey Kong or something like that.
5430060	5431060	The year of Donkey Kong.
5431060	5432060	The year of Donkey Kong.
5432060	5433060	There you go.
5433060	5434060	That might be when we see it again.
5434060	5439580	All right, there it is, once again, a classic game of the week, Donkey Kong 3.
5439580	5441060	So yeah.
5441060	5442660	And it's surprising I never picked that before.
5442660	5446820	I think I had it ready to go another week, and then we flipped it out as last minute
5446820	5447820	for something else.
5447820	5450140	Because I was like, I thought I'd picked that before.
5450140	5451140	But there it is.
5451140	5452620	I think I had the video pulled and everything.
5452620	5453620	But there it is.
5453620	5454620	We're doing it tonight.
5454620	5455620	Donkey Kong 3.
5455620	5456620	All right.
5456620	5458140	Let's get into some rapid fire news, shall we?
5458140	5461540	A lot of other stuff going on in the gaming industry, right, Logie?
5461540	5462540	Yep.
5462540	5469300	So starting off with the games of gold for December, we've got looks like Raven Remastered
5469300	5470540	and Bleed 2.
5470540	5474720	Those are going to be our Xbox One games for the month.
5474720	5480180	And then the Xbox 360 compatible game, we have Saints Row Get Out of Hell.
5480180	5484100	And that's going to be available as well in December.
5484100	5490700	And then on the PlayStation side of the house, we have Worms Rumble and Just Cause 4.
5490700	5495080	Worms Rumble is going to be available on the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.
5495080	5497420	Just Cause 4 is just PlayStation 4.
5497420	5499900	At least that's the PlayStation 4 version.
5499900	5504860	And then, of course, as mentioned before, they're going to have Rocket Arena is going
5504860	5510500	to be available as your kind of premium PlayStation 5 game that's going to be free.
5510500	5514560	And so that'll be available as well.
5514560	5518620	And then we've got some fun glitches now.
5518620	5525100	So this kind of harkens back for me to Grand Theft Auto 4 and the evil swing set that they
5525100	5528820	used to have in there where you would be able to fling yourself into the air.
5528820	5531660	Didn't you have a video like spotlighting some of these bugs?
5531660	5532660	I do have a video.
5532660	5533660	It's on our channel actually.
5533660	5534660	Is it really?
5534660	5535660	Yeah.
5535660	5537300	I think it's on the Orange Lounge.
5537300	5541420	The long forgotten Orange Lounge Radio YouTube page.
5541420	5543940	Do you know I was looking at it randomly the other day.
5543940	5548660	There's still a video on there of you getting drunk playing Mario Kart at the arcade.
5548660	5549960	It was your bachelor party.
5549960	5550960	You remember that night?
5550960	5551960	Yeah.
5551960	5552960	And we filmed it?
5552960	5554960	I'm going to remove that.
5554960	5558840	That's the most viewed video, Loki.
5558840	5560840	Like 12,000 views.
5560840	5561840	Wow.
5561840	5563800	Something like that.
5563800	5564800	It's pretty.
5564800	5565800	It's up there.
5565800	5566800	All right.
5566800	5573880	Well, so now in Red Dead Online, they have a bridge that is going to allow you to fling
5573880	5575520	yourself as well.
5575520	5581680	So this new bridge currently is near McFarland's Ranch.
5581680	5587720	And if you throw a projectile weapon into one of the first few slats of the bridge,
5587720	5594020	it causes the collision just to go crazy and just fling around everywhere, launching yourself
5594020	5597660	into the air in a pretty hilarious fashion.
5597660	5600080	So of course they have different videos online.
5600080	5605060	So definitely go check it out if you play Red Dead Online because they could patch it
5605060	5608240	out or maybe they won't because they never did with Grand Theft Auto IV.
5608240	5610480	They just left it in there because it's something silly.
5610480	5613040	It doesn't really necessarily break the game.
5613040	5614560	It's just kind of a fun thing to do.
5614560	5619480	So yeah, it's pretty cool to see something like that come back.
5619480	5623800	What do you think about that whole Red Dead Online sold separately thing that was recent
5623800	5626100	news?
5626100	5628760	They selling it separately or are they just putting it out for free?
5628760	5631000	I thought it was like a $5 thing.
5631000	5634760	Oh, that's not that bad.
5634760	5638960	Red Dead Online, I guess that's fine.
5638960	5641480	I don't know if there's a lot of people playing Red Dead Online.
5641480	5645800	I would think Grand Theft Auto Online would be something they more interested in selling
5645800	5649360	separately.
5649360	5654960	But I mean, that's where they're making most their money is online now with all the microtransactions.
5654960	5657880	I just don't think Red Dead Online makes as much money as Grand Theft Auto.
5657880	5659760	Grand Theft Auto has made them a ton of money.
5659760	5662440	I mean, that's why it's been going for so long.
5662440	5665920	Was that your cat that just screamed in the background or was that one of your kids?
5665920	5667200	Oh yeah, it's always a catch.
5667200	5668200	No, it's always the cat.
5668440	5673800	She was in here a second ago screaming because she didn't have more treats or something.
5673800	5675040	It's like about once an hour.
5675040	5677560	So yeah, that was a cat.
5677560	5683400	We finally found treats that Mr. Smoosh likes, by the way, because, you know, there's a story
5683400	5685240	with our cat, Mr. Smoosh.
5685240	5688960	He does not like traditional dry kitty treats that you like throw on the ground because
5688960	5691640	we had a ton of them left over from when Sanrio passed.
5691640	5692960	We tried to see if Smoosh would be into it.
5692960	5694080	Nope, he didn't like it.
5694080	5696520	But we finally found, I should say, Alan really found it.
5696520	5698760	He will eat the shit out of those.
5698760	5701040	There's wet kitty treats.
5701040	5702600	So we call him Licky Licky.
5702600	5704880	So we go lick lick Licky Licky.
5704880	5708560	And it's like this little thing you put pour out of a like little plastic thing.
5708560	5710680	It's like it's like tuna and gravy or something.
5710680	5712760	I don't know, some type of interesting little treat.
5712760	5713800	But he'll he'll get there.
5713800	5717200	He'll sit right there and go.
5717200	5718200	He's starting to lick it up.
5718200	5719460	It's really cute.
5719460	5720460	So yeah.
5720460	5721460	Yeah.
5721460	5724560	As John Hunter Matt says, Mr. Smoosh only accepts gold plated treats.
5724600	5731840	You would think so because he only will eat food from the like hoity toity pet food store.
5731840	5734720	We can't shop for him at PetSmart or Petco.
5734720	5739180	We have to go to like the natural pet store, you know, in that in that part of town.
5739180	5741160	And that's where these treats came from as well.
5741160	5743160	So anyway.
5743160	5744160	All right.
5744160	5745160	Moving on.
5745160	5746660	Sorry, this wasn't supposed to be the cat hour.
5746660	5747660	But you know what?
5747660	5749780	It's been a slower Newsweek.
5749780	5752820	I say that and then I'm about to really drop a big piece of news.
5752820	5757280	This is a pretty big deal actually, here in rapid fire news.
5757280	5760620	Do you remember the game Saga Frontier on the PlayStation?
5760620	5761620	Yes.
5761620	5765700	Big, big Square Enix title again, I think Dark Soccer spotlighted this as a classic
5765700	5769540	game not that long ago, because I have to be honest, I didn't care for this game when
5769540	5770540	I first played it.
5770540	5773140	I bought it and I didn't care for it.
5773140	5776820	But well, we're gonna get a chance to give it a second opinion because Saga Frontier
5776820	5778860	remastered is coming out.
5778860	5783700	And again, I don't please do not send hate mail to the show because I said what I said
5783700	5785380	about Saga Frontier.
5785380	5789380	You know, you know what else I didn't like the first time I played it was Mass Effect.
5789380	5791860	And then I gave it a second chance and I fell in love with it.
5791860	5796080	So maybe a remaster will be a good chance for me to give a game a second chance.
5796080	5799980	Maybe I just was you know, it was a long time ago that I checked it out on PlayStation.
5799980	5802980	I'm kind of in a different place with gaming now than I was then.
5802980	5808000	So it is but a lot of people remember this game very fondly back from 1997.
5808000	5812440	So people very excited about this remaster and then it gives people like me a chance
5812440	5814680	to check it out all over again.
5814680	5821760	So it's coming out next summer for Switch, PlayStation 4, Steam, iOS and Android.
5821760	5826740	That part has me a little concerned because I'm only a little worried that maybe like
5826740	5833460	you remember the Final Fantasy like six that they did for iOS and Android.
5833460	5837680	It's not great and not the way I would prefer to play those games even though they did give
5837680	5839120	it all new art and everything.
5839120	5844400	And now that I'm looking at some of what I see here in Soccer Frontier Remastered, I
5844400	5847640	think it could be a product of the same formula.
5847640	5851120	So just be what buyer beware.
5851120	5852160	Wait for the reviews.
5852160	5853160	Wait for the reviews.
5853160	5854160	Yeah.
5854160	5855680	But you know what?
5855680	5856680	Maybe they've heard some of the feedback.
5856680	5858480	Maybe they're gonna make changes.
5858480	5861640	We shouldn't hold the prior games completely against it.
5861640	5866000	But I'm just gonna say these are some things that make me a little bit tepidly optimistic
5866000	5867000	about it.
5867000	5868000	We'll see.
5868000	5873680	But I mean, the videos in the trailer do look very interesting.
5873680	5877340	There's supposed to be new cut scenes and events and a new protagonist even.
5877340	5880620	So that's kind of something different is that they're actually adding to the story a little
5880620	5881620	bit.
5881620	5883200	So that could be very cool.
5883200	5887800	So check that out when it releases, although we don't have an exact date just yet.
5887800	5889640	All right.
5889640	5894900	Moving on, one more story for you, which has to do with AOC or Representative Alexandria
5894900	5895900	Ocasio-Cortez.
5895900	5901300	Now, I'm not gonna report every time she goes live on Twitch, but it is notable to
5901300	5903460	point out she did go live on Twitch again.
5903460	5907860	And part of the reason I am bringing it up and we talked about it the first time is because
5907860	5914720	it is interesting to see more and more politicians start to embrace Twitch as a platform.
5914720	5919380	And what's particularly notable about this last stream that she did, it didn't get quite
5919380	5920460	as many viewers.
5920460	5922680	I don't think it had the hype going into it.
5922680	5925600	And we're also now post-election as opposed to pre-election, which is probably a big part
5925600	5926600	of it.
5926600	5930960	But it's still, I mean, when I looked at it, it was like 80, 90,000 viewers.
5930960	5932480	That's nothing to be ashamed of.
5932480	5938320	And that's still, you know, the size of two football stadiums worth of people.
5938320	5945360	But what is notable about this is that she actually had playing among us with her Jagmeet
5945360	5949440	Singh, the leader of Canada's new Democratic Party.
5949480	5954960	So this was kind of in collaboration with a notable Canadian political figure.
5954960	5960880	So it's an interesting kind of crossing boundaries there and now bringing a Canadian figure into
5960880	5961880	this.
5961880	5966580	So, like I said, what AOC is doing, other people are noticing, and that isn't just unique
5966580	5968800	to the US.
5968800	5971040	So pretty cool.
5971040	5972320	That all happened the other day.
5972320	5974440	It still had a pretty high amount of viewers.
5974440	5976320	I did not catch the whole thing.
5976400	5979600	I don't know if you guys in chat saw it and have anything to say about it.
5979600	5983440	Oh, Black and Pat points out they raised $200K for charity.
5983440	5984440	Pretty cool.
5984440	5988320	ActDef says we need Bernie playing among us.
5988320	5989320	You never know.
5989320	5992600	Bernie did have a Twitch channel, as did Donald Trump.
5992600	5996800	But in both those cases, which are obviously two very polar opposite sides of the political
5996800	6006920	spectrum, it was mostly redistribution of other stuff like a televised rally or a televised
6006920	6010160	interview was also being delivered on Twitch.
6010160	6016840	What makes what AOC is doing unique and different is that AOC is making Twitch content for Twitch
6016840	6018080	on Twitch.
6018080	6023640	So that's where she's kind of breaking boundaries there and bringing other people along for
6023640	6024640	the ride.
6024640	6027560	We had Representative Ilhan Omar the first time.
6027560	6030520	Now we have Jagmeet Singh from Canada.
6030520	6036520	And who knows who might come play among us, or maybe she'll play another game in the future.
6036520	6038880	What game do you want to see AOC play next?
6038880	6040480	That's what I want to know in chat.
6040480	6041480	What game do you want to see?
6041480	6045160	Civilization would be a good one, like Civ 6.
6045160	6048520	That might be a fun one, right?
6048520	6051000	I'd be very curious to see that.
6051000	6054000	So yeah, Black and Pat saying they raised over $200K for charity.
6054440	6055440	That's very cool.
6055440	6056440	Let's see.
6056440	6059640	I'm trying to see the other comments here.
6059640	6063000	A lot of the other comments on SAGA Frontier.
6063000	6065840	Act Deft picking another Twitch all-star game right now.
6065840	6068800	Phasmophobia with AOC.
6068800	6070040	That might work.
6070040	6071800	Tigerclaw says Mortal Kombat 11.
6071800	6073520	I don't know about that.
6073520	6076400	Akuma JP says RE7.
6076400	6080320	I don't know if AOC would be down for the jump scare games, but it would be entertaining.
6080960	6083480	SSG100Matt says Justin Trudeau is a gamer.
6083480	6084480	Get him.
6084480	6085480	You never know.
6085480	6086480	You never know.
6086480	6087480	How about Minecraft?
6087480	6088480	Would you watch Minecraft with AOC?
6088480	6089480	That could be interesting too.
6089480	6090480	Sure.
6090480	6091480	Sure.
6091480	6092480	Why not?
6092480	6093480	All right.
6093480	6094480	Or somebody teaching her about a game.
6094480	6098000	You know, kind of like Conan, but not necessarily funny or for comedy.
6098000	6099000	I don't know.
6099000	6100000	It'd be interesting.
6100000	6101000	All right.
6101000	6103560	I don't know what else she plays, but I'm sure there's something.
6103560	6104560	All right.
6104560	6105560	Anyhow.
6105560	6106560	She plays League of Legends, I think.
6106560	6107560	Oh, does she?
6107560	6108560	Why does she stream some of that?
6108560	6109560	That'd be interesting.
6109800	6115800	Oh, there's a great suggestion from Akdeft, Jackbox Party Pack with AOC.
6115800	6121560	That is a great idea, except she would definitely want to have a controlled environment for
6121560	6126440	that, meaning only select Twitch people, kind of like how she's picking her people to play
6126440	6127580	Among Us with.
6127580	6128580	She hasn't posted her code.
6128580	6129800	Let anybody join.
6129800	6134440	I would not want to see that happen with Jackbox either because people, you know, people write
6134440	6136920	some real obscene things in Jackbox, right?
6136920	6142600	But if she can get a controlled game of 10 people and then maybe allow randos to join
6142600	6144400	the audience, because all they would do is vote.
6144400	6149000	They can't get in there and put things like, you know, fuck, fuck, fuck, or, you know,
6149000	6150840	all those other nasty things.
6152840	6153840	Interesting.
6153840	6154840	I'd be very I'd be very curious.
6154840	6156400	Yeah, that might be a fun one.
6156400	6160760	If it's a controlled environment where she knows who she's playing with and that everybody's
6160760	6164560	going to keep it G rated because that's you know, she is a politician at the end of the
6165200	6166200	end of the day.
6166200	6169560	You know, maybe PG is about as far as you can go PG.
6169560	6170560	Star Wars is rated PG.
6170560	6171560	Right.
6171560	6172560	So you can go about that far.
6172560	6173560	All right.
6173560	6174560	Anyway.
6174560	6176240	Uh, let's move on.
6176240	6177240	Interesting.
6177240	6181300	Quest Buster says there's a clip floating out there of AOC saying how being patient
6181300	6184720	in that game dealing with rage quitters helps her in Congress.
6184720	6186460	Well, she should.
6186460	6187460	She should play that on stream.
6187460	6188460	Then I'd be very curious.
6188460	6191360	Akuma JP says, oh, a large to have an Among Us night.
6191360	6193440	You know, we were talking about it and it's my fault.
6193440	6198240	I didn't follow through on it, but soon I do want to still make that happen.
6198240	6199240	Maybe just in time for the holidays.
6199240	6200240	All right.
6200240	6203920	In the meantime, let's travel around the world and check out some games you can play besides
6203920	6209360	just Among Us with some release dates, even though it might be slowing down a little bit,
6209360	6210360	but not, not really.
6210360	6212680	Actually, I think I was looking at this week and no, there's still some big releases this
6212680	6213680	week.
6213680	6214680	Right?
6214680	6215680	Yeah.
6215680	6216680	It's still pretty busy actually.
6216680	6218680	So, uh, let me run it down.
6218680	6219680	Yep.
6219920	6223360	So, uh, they front load everything in December because you know, holidays.
6223360	6224360	Sure.
6224360	6229560	Um, Kronos before the shadow or before the ashes on PC, Nintendo switch PlayStation four,
6229560	6236380	Xbox one stadia, empire of sin on PC, Mac, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox
6236380	6237480	one.
6237480	6245480	We have frost point VR proving grounds on all of your VR platforms, uh, rip the index
6245480	6246480	in Vive.
6246480	6253400	Uh, we've got Tom Clancy's rainbow six siege on PlayStation five and Xbox series X, uh,
6253400	6260880	twin mirror on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one worms rumble on PC, PlayStation four and
6260880	6261880	PlayStation five.
6261880	6264920	I remember that one is free for PlayStation owners.
6264920	6271640	If you have PlayStation plus, um, salmon max save the world remastered on PC and Nintendo
6271640	6277600	switch, uh, Sharon, the wanderer, the tower of fortune and the dice of fate on PC and
6277600	6278600	intend to switch.
6278600	6279600	That's a mouthful.
6279600	6280600	Yes.
6280600	6284600	Absolute drift on Nintendo switch.
6284600	6292480	That's ironic for Nintendo switch, um, uh, layer Risa two on a loss legends and the secret
6292480	6298840	ferry on the toes, which places you to four and PlayStation five Haven, uh, on PC places
6298840	6305800	of five, Xbox one and Xbox series X immortals Phoenix rising on PC, Nintendo switch places
6305800	6310600	you for PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series X and stadia.

6337080	6345160	to HD remaster on Nintendo switch, uh, FIFA 21 on PlayStation five and Xbox series X, uh,
6345160	6349920	fire emblem, a shadow dragon, and the blade of light on into the switch.
6349920	6352240	Dan, this is a busy week.
6352240	6353240	Exactly.
6353240	6359040	Fitness boxing to rhythm and exercise and intend to switch John wick hex on and tend
6359040	6366360	to switch and Xbox one, uh, Madden NFL 21 on PlayStation five and Xbox series X and
6366360	6369480	to Nuki sunset on PC.
6369480	6371680	And I believe that is it.
6371680	6372680	That's enough.
6372680	6373680	All right.
6373680	6376400	Actually, Japan, uh, looking at the release dates, they're pretty similar.
6376400	6381040	There's quite a lot happening this week, uh, empire of sin from Sega releases on December
6381040	6384840	the first I'm assuming that's kind of dated to match with the rest of the world.
6384840	6388520	But then when you get to December 3rd, um, you get a lot of, a lot of similar stuff to
6388520	6389800	what Loki was just talking about.
6389800	6394960	Although the Japanese versions, uh, most notably on the switch, uh, at layer Risa to lost legends
6394960	6399000	in the secret ferry, which I think Loki mentioned for the U S as well, uh, sheer in the wander,
6399000	6400780	the tower of fortune and the dice of fate.
6400780	6405640	That same one is also out in Japan this week, uh, immortals, Phoenix rising, uh, Sumiko
6405640	6407520	Gurashi, uh, Oh, yeah.
6407520	6414000	No Sumi day tabby Kaibun sugo Roku, uh, comes out this week, uh, as well as immortals.
6414000	6415000	I'm sorry.
6415000	6416000	I just said that one.
6416000	6419360	Uh, there's some type of remothered double pack is out this week together.
6419360	6424800	The battle cats gets a price reduction and a game called Derby stallion is released as
6424800	6425800	well.
6425800	6427040	And, uh, Oh, I'm sorry.
6427040	6428040	Those are for another.
6428040	6430220	Those are some other dates that snuck in here.
6430220	6435740	Let me look real quick at PlayStation four and five to see what is out in Japan.
6435740	6440680	Um, immortals rising on, on PlayStation five this week on Japan.
6440680	6442500	So there's a new PS five game this week.
6442500	6444380	That's pretty exciting.
6444380	6448420	And looking at the PlayStation four, a lot of the same stuff I read for switch, um, mortals
6448420	6452260	Phoenix rising the at layer Risa to, uh, this one's different.
6452260	6459580	And then, uh, go by train hash hash hero Yamanote Linae comes out, uh, from square Enix actually.
6459580	6465540	Uh, and then, uh, that same double pack, Ooh, as well as the dark pictures, little hope
6465540	6467820	comes out on the PlayStation four this week.
6467820	6469820	I'm looking up that go by train.
6469820	6471640	It's a PlayStation VR game.
6471640	6472640	That is like a train.
6472640	6475700	It's a train driving game, but in VR, that's pretty cool.
6475700	6476700	Hmm.
6476700	6478080	That was neat.
6478080	6480220	I wish we got more of those types of games here.
6480220	6482840	Once in a while though, they'll localize and they sneak through, but most of those
6482840	6484980	train games kind of skip us by.
6484980	6489180	So all right, there you go for Japanese releases, uh, with dark soccer and not here tonight,
6489180	6492340	maybe Loki can step in and, uh, talk about the UK releases.
6492340	6493340	Yeah.
6493340	6501820	So we have Kronos before the ashes on a PlayStation four looks like Xbox one, Nintendo switch
6501820	6502820	and PC.
6502820	6509820	Uh, definitely cry five special edition on PlayStation born Xbox one monster truck championship

6554500	6563380	and Xbox series X Anima arcane edition on PlayStation four dragon adventure on looks

6642620	6643620	And that's it.
6643620	6644620	All right.
6644620	6650520	Busy week, uh, not usual that the week after Thanksgiving is so busy, but probably a lot
6650520	6654560	of small delays this year because the pandemic and so forth and, and things are in a weird
6654560	6656880	place right now because of everything going on in 2020.
6656880	6661260	So, um, but I'm sure it's going to start to dry up the next couple of weeks as we start
6661260	6666280	to get to Christmas because in Hanukkah, yeah, it's going to start to slow down.
6666280	6667280	All right.
6667280	6668280	Anyhow.
6668280	6672560	Um, we are going to do some more news stories here and then we will get to your questions
6672560	6677200	and comments in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.
6677200	6681640	Let's go to Loki with our next story.
6681640	6685140	So this is kind of what I'm hoping with my work too, is that they're going to allow us
6685140	6687520	to start working from home permanently.
6687520	6693940	Um, but one gaming company has done that as well, or I should probably one new game company
6693940	6697060	has been allowing their employees to do that.
6697060	6700200	So Square Enix says they're going to allow most of their employees to work from home
6700200	6705420	permanently in the new policy goes into effect starting in December, uh, provided that their
6705420	6706660	positions allow for it.
6706660	6711300	And they have the flexibility to change their designation month to month or on a month to
6711300	6712300	month basis.
6712300	6716060	But they said that they're expecting that 80% of their employees will end up working
6716060	6721240	from home, uh, once the program starts, um, well next week, actually.
6721240	6727380	So, um, I mean, definitely with this type of environment, you know, with the pandemic
6727380	6732980	and everything, um, it is nice to see that companies are able to have their employees
6732980	6737220	work remotely, as long as they're able to strike a nice work-life balance, that would
6737220	6738700	be important.
6738700	6744780	Um, I'm totally for working from home, I love not having to drive in.
6744780	6745780	It's great.
6745780	6750580	I think when we talk about that new normal post COVID, you know, I don't think necessarily
6750580	6751820	all the news is bad.
6751820	6755380	One of those things is that, you know, yeah, like work from home, I think you're going
6755380	6756620	to see more often.
6756620	6759760	And it's interesting to me with Square Enix in particular, because, you know, with Final
6759760	6764760	Fantasy XIV, which I play a lot, um, the, the pandemic and the adjustment to the work
6764760	6769240	at home situation was kind of cited as it was a little rough to get going.
6769240	6772520	And that's why they ended up delaying some content for a few months.
6772520	6776680	Um, they're back on track now and they're moving, you know, at a, at a, they just had
6776680	6781200	another live letter this past week for their big, big patch, uh, the Tuesday after this
6781200	6784200	upcoming one, December 8th, they're doing a big, big content patch.
6784200	6787240	And it sounds like they're going to release their next, or excuse me, they're going to
6787240	6792800	tease their next expansion in February, which is about four months off cycle from when they
6792800	6796280	would have done it normally October, but everything in, in Final Fantasy XIV land kind of got
6796280	6797520	bumped back four months.
6797520	6801680	So even though there was a huge adjustment period, it seems like they're kind of used
6801680	6802760	to it now.
6802760	6806080	So it's interesting to think that, you know, Square Enix, that would include Final Fantasy
6806080	6809240	XIV, a lot of that development is going to happen from home now.
6809240	6811400	So it's neat.
6811400	6812440	It's just, it's different.
6812440	6816840	It's another way to kind of, you know, but if you think about it, a lot of indie developers
6816920	6818760	have worked from home for a long, long time.
6818760	6819480	Right.
6819480	6824120	So yeah, so games, games can certainly be made from the comfort of your own home.
6824120	6826400	And I'm sure a lot of people are wondering about their own jobs.
6826400	6831080	Loki mentioned that too, as Joe and Matt and Chad is saying, I hope, I hope we're able to stay
6831080	6832040	remote.
6832040	6835040	I know they're going to be, you know, some changes are coming to my job as well, where it's
6835040	6839520	going to be kind of like havesies, you know, like some days we'll need to be in the office for
6839520	6841560	things, but some days we'll be able to work remote.
6841560	6844160	And that sounds, that's a good balance for me, I think.
6844240	6847120	So, yeah, it's going to be interesting to see what it looks like for people.
6848800	6849680	There's going to be a lot more.
6849680	6852800	I mean, of course there were people that were working from home before this.
6852800	6857840	It wasn't a new concept, but now it's just going to be, I think many companies that didn't think
6857840	6862240	they could had to, and now they've realized, oh, we can do this.
6862240	6864800	And I think Square Enix is kind of one of those companies.
6864800	6869680	So Akuma JP and Chad says security is the only bottleneck.
6869680	6871120	That's a very interesting point.
6871120	6871760	Yeah.
6871840	6875360	You know, I used to work in the healthcare industry.
6875360	6880400	And so I would be very curious about, you know, how they were able to make some of that privacy
6880400	6884960	and security stuff work in the home situation because, you know, it's a very touchy area.
6884960	6885200	Yeah.
6885200	6886560	A lot of it's VPN.
6886560	6887280	Yeah.
6887280	6888560	So, all right.
6889120	6891680	Anyhow, let's move on to another story.
6891680	6898080	And this one has to do with an actual historical marker, meaning it's one of those places where
6898080	6900960	they like actually, they have a sign that marks.
6900960	6902560	This is the place.
6902560	6904960	And in this case, it is in New Hampshire.
6905600	6911360	And it is a new sign that talks about BASIC, the first user-friendly computer programming
6911360	6911920	language.
6911920	6917040	BASIC is something near and dear to my heart because the Commodore 64, it was all powered
6917040	6917520	by BASIC.
6917520	6921680	I mean, they had machine language and assembly and stuff in there too, but BASIC was built
6921680	6922000	in.
6922000	6924960	You turned on the computer and you were in BASIC programming mode.
6925920	6930720	BASIC, by the way, is short for Beginners All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code.
6930720	6931600	How about that?
6931600	6935200	It was invented at Dartmouth College in 1964.
6935200	6942720	And there was actually a column that happened recently in the Concord Monitor where it was
6942720	6948960	noted that there were 255 historical markers for bridges, historical figures, but there
6948960	6953760	was nothing about New Hampshire's technical and scientific accomplishments.
6953760	6956080	So, that's what happened.
6956080	6958240	They actually got a historical marker for it.
6958240	6961280	It is located on New Hampshire Route 120.
6961280	6965520	It's not far from Dartmouth College and where BASIC, of course, was created.
6966080	6969440	State historical markers are always on state highways.
6969440	6973360	That's why it's not actually on the college itself, but that is pretty cool.
6973360	6976560	And I hope it becomes a pokey stop, quite frankly.
6977680	6985600	So, I can say from having reviewed plenty of things in the old Ingress OPR and now Niantic
6985600	6988160	Wayfarer, I would absolutely accept that.
6988160	6990160	As a point of interest, that sign.
6990160	6992880	So, that thing better become a pokey stop.
6992880	6997120	The only thing that would disqualify it is that if there's something real close to it,
6997120	6999520	that's also a pokey stop already.
6999520	7002560	But in the picture, it looks like there's nothing around it.
7002560	7007120	So, I hope it does become a pokey stop and I want someone to send me a gift from there.
7007120	7007840	Thank you, thank you.
7008640	7009040	All right.
7010080	7012000	SG100 Matt says, it's Dartmouth College.
7012000	7012960	It'll be a pokey stop.
7012960	7016400	It's near on the state highway, but yes, it should be, hopefully.
7018160	7023040	YYR says, Commodore 64 and 128 basic programmer here.
7023040	7024720	I made a bunch of shitty math games.
7024720	7030480	Hey, but shitty math games brought you shitty pixel games in the year 2020.
7031520	7034640	Questbuster in chat says, 10, print.
7034640	7036320	Hello, VOG network.
7036320	7040160	Now then, all you need is 20, go to 10 and now run.
7042880	7043280	Perfect.
7043920	7044240	All right.
7044320	7050800	Well, congratulations for the push to get that recognized and it actually worked.
7050800	7052160	I think that's pretty cool.
7052160	7052960	All right, moving on.
7052960	7054000	Just a couple more stories.
7054000	7054500	Loki.
7055760	7056480	All right.
7056480	7062960	So, Sony, of course, is touting that their console launch is the biggest console launch ever.
7063760	7069360	And of course, they didn't really say what their sales figures were, but they basically saying
7069360	7075360	that we wanted to confirm that PlayStation 5 is their biggest console launch ever and the
7075360	7076720	demand is unprecedented.
7078320	7084960	I remember seeing actually Black Friday there as folks camped out, waiting for new consoles
7084960	7089600	and stuff, which is kind of crazy in this kind of environment, but that's where we're at.
7089600	7096640	I mean, I guess scalpers and all sorts of problems with that stuff, but it's still apparently
7096640	7097600	doing well.
7097600	7098880	And I think both of them are doing well.
7098960	7103760	But since no one's releasing figures, we don't really know how to compare.
7103760	7107680	But once again, why do we need to know that as consumers?
7107680	7108480	It doesn't matter.
7108480	7113120	All it does is feed into the, ha, our team won and your team lost mentality.
7113120	7114960	So, I get it as well.
7114960	7118560	Yeah, and Bobby's confirming Microsoft said it was their biggest launch ever as well.
7118560	7120320	And I remember hearing that in the last week.
7120320	7122400	So, both consoles are doing very well.
7122400	7123040	And actually, I will say...
7123040	7126480	Who would have thought when everybody's forced to stay at home that home entertainment would
7126480	7127520	be successful?
7127520	7133360	Well, and I was more surprised by it being the biggest console launch ever more because
7133360	7137920	I would have thought there were less of them out there because of the pandemic.
7137920	7142800	So, I would have thought by nature PlayStation 4 did better because there were more of them
7142800	7143440	when it launched.
7143440	7144800	But I guess that's not really the case.
7144800	7148640	That's just me kind of remembering it with rose colored glasses or whatever.
7148640	7153520	I think there is something to be said about more people in general are playing games and
7153520	7159360	more people want these sorts of devices in their homes because the folks that are getting
7159360	7164240	older and are making the purchasing decisions in their household grew up with video games
7164240	7169280	all around them, grew up on things like Mario and Donkey Kong 3, Stanley, and things like
7169280	7169920	that.
7169920	7171920	People kind of remember that.
7171920	7177760	So, I kind of think just by nature, there are more gamers and so there's more people
7177760	7179200	looking for PlayStation 5.
7179200	7184240	But apparently PlayStation 5 and Xbox X are like the must have holiday gifts this year.
7185280	7188720	So, they are the Cabbage Patch Kids of 2020.
7189520	7194080	I don't know if there's an actual toy that's like that this year.
7194080	7197760	I thought there was supposed to be something, but I'm just hearing about how people are
7197760	7198320	going crazy.
7199120	7204800	There was a story on the news here locally about people were camping out at the mall
7204800	7207760	for PlayStation 5 when there were two of them available.
7208640	7209120	Two of them.
7210080	7211600	So, interesting.
7213520	7219440	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says our local gaming bar is almost completely booked for kids parties
7219440	7224640	from parents who aren't able to get an Xbox or PlayStation 5 for their kids by Christmas.
7225280	7229680	Black Compat says I've given up on a PlayStation 5 until February.
7229680	7230480	Yeah, me too.
7230480	7234080	And I knew when I made the decision I was going to push for Xbox.
7234960	7237280	I'll get it in 2021 and it'll be all right.
7237280	7239200	There'll be more games available at that point.
7239760	7243520	As long as I don't miss Final Fantasy 16, and I won't, we're good.
7245200	7249520	Bobby Blackwolf says I predicted the animatronic baby Yoda toy would be a hot toy, but I don't
7249520	7250480	think that happened.
7250480	7250980	Interesting.
7251840	7256560	But maybe it's because there's lots of baby Yoda toys out there, but there's only one
7256560	7257280	PlayStation 5.
7257280	7258800	There's only one Xbox Series X.
7258800	7259120	I don't know.
7259120	7260800	That's just speculation.
7260800	7261920	So, anyway.
7263200	7266480	Act F says I'm going to wait for the new consoles until next year.
7266480	7270080	This year, I got a Samsung S20 and I've been loving the hell out of it.
7270080	7273520	Playing Pokemon Go on 120 hertz is a godsend.
7273520	7274480	Yeah, yeah.
7274480	7275920	So, all right.
7277360	7278240	Well, let's move on.
7278880	7280480	One last story for you guys.
7280480	7282240	And it has to do with Google Stadia.
7283200	7289040	Google Stadia is promising 400 games in development, which, you know, sometimes Stadia gets criticized
7289040	7290080	because they don't really have enough.
7291280	7294560	So, Stadia wants to tell you more are coming.
7294560	7299840	And these are coming from comments made in an interview with Mobile Syrup by the director
7299840	7305360	of games for Google Stadia, meaning the actual, like, an actual, as opposed to people on Twitter
7305360	7309200	that are, like, kind of not really affiliated with Google Stadia, but making comments.
7309200	7312160	This person actually is with Google Stadia, director of games.
7312880	7315840	These games are going to be launching over the next few years.
7316560	7318560	Not necessarily all of them in 2021.
7320560	7323680	In the interview saying my team is almost done with 2021.
7323680	7325520	We're thinking about 2022 right now.
7325520	7326640	That's our focus.
7326640	7330320	2023 is really kind of where we're aiming our sights.
7330320	7332400	So, Stadia sounds like it might be a slow burn.
7333840	7337520	And hopefully, Google will continue to believe in it for that long.
7337520	7342960	And, you know, again, as much as it sounds like I might be giving Stadia a hard time sometimes,
7343600	7346800	I want Google to play the long game on this.
7347520	7353760	And, you know, when we have by 2023, there probably will be more 5G.
7353760	7357760	And so Comcast will be needled on that bandwidth cap.
7357760	7361360	And I think there will be more of a space for things like Stadia.
7361360	7363840	So I hope that they have the games to kind of back it up.
7364560	7365360	It'll be very interesting.
7365360	7368960	But Stadia still doesn't have the ability to just, oh, open up your laptop and play
7368960	7369840	right in your browser.
7372080	7375840	I still feel like that's something Stadia promised a year ago that they still need to
7375840	7378000	really make it that easy.
7378000	7379680	Not just for Pro, for everybody.
7379680	7381520	Yes, I know you can do it in the browser on Pro.
7382160	7385520	But I'm talking for everybody and 4K if you want it for everybody.
7387360	7393600	So anyway, Google has added things like Doom Eternal, Borderlands 3, Hotline Miami,
7393600	7395120	Cyberpunk is incoming.
7395120	7399440	But, you know, the 100 games that are in there still somehow doesn't feel like enough.
7399440	7403120	But Google does have some first party studios in Montreal and Los Angeles.
7403120	7406080	Don't forget, they have some type of development deal with harmonix.
7406720	7408320	Fuser wasn't it because that's everywhere.
7408320	7411680	So there's another harmonix game that's in development that's going to be a Google
7411680	7412880	Stadia thing.
7412880	7416240	That as a music game fan, that might get me to suddenly perk up and pay attention.
7416240	7416640	We'll see.
7417440	7422160	Don't forget, they have talented folks like Phil Harrison, Jade Raymond, you know, they've
7422160	7425680	so we're still waiting for those exclusive games.
7427120	7429440	But I think the concern is, look, they can.
7429440	7432720	The thing about Stadia is I don't have to buy one.
7433440	7438320	So if Stadia suddenly gets that must have game tomorrow, it'll be pretty easy to go
7438320	7438880	in there and get it.
7438880	7442400	I'm not gonna have to worry about supply issues like we do on the PlayStation 5 or Xbox or
7442400	7443040	whatever.
7443040	7445360	Like that's the whole perk about Stadia.
7445360	7450160	I think the worry that a lot of us have is Google will pull the plug if it's not successful
7450160	7451360	by 2023.
7451360	7456000	But if Google is committed to playing the long game, then maybe there will be some,
7456000	7459280	you know, we'll be looking back on these years having a laugh.
7459280	7461040	Like, why didn't we see this coming sooner?
7461040	7469040	I just think that their idea with Stadia is it's a good idea, just not for now.
7469040	7475760	Like it's just like these games streaming services and stuff where it's just not the
7475760	7476720	right time for that.
7476720	7482240	Our infrastructure, maybe in other countries like Japan where we have like rock solid infrastructure
7482240	7484960	for Internet and stuff and no bandwidth caps.
7484960	7490960	It may be a great idea in the United States, not a great idea because we have bandwidth
7490960	7491440	caps.
7491440	7496880	Our Internet's not fast enough to really drive that, you know, gameplay and stuff.
7496880	7501120	Whereas it yeah, in the future when our bandwidth caps are just like let's imagine unlimited
7501120	7503840	in our internet speeds like a gigabit down or something like that.
7503840	7505920	And we can basically stream whatever the hell we want.
7506960	7509760	That's gonna be amazing because then we'll never have to upgrade our consoles.
7509760	7514160	It's always just gonna be, you know, the most cutting edge everything.
7514720	7516240	And that's the dream right there.
7516240	7519840	But we're not living in that time period, unfortunately.
7519840	7523600	And so I think that's where the struggle is gonna be is that one.
7525360	7527440	I don't like the idea of having to buy my games.
7527440	7530560	I think it should be like, you know, especially with a streaming console like that.
7531280	7534720	I think it should just be a library they have access to and you pay a monthly fee or whatever,
7534720	7535440	like games pass.
7536960	7541200	But it's just too early and this is not the right environment for it.
7541200	7546880	It's it's gonna be a hard sell when you're getting charged, you know, for going over
7546880	7548320	your bandwidth and stuff like that.
7548320	7551200	And so that's gonna be the struggle right now.
7551200	7555840	I think, you know, five years from now when we maybe move past all that and our infrastructure
7555840	7558320	is better, then maybe it might be the time.
7558320	7560880	But by that time, this will probably be dead.
7560880	7562800	It'll be the next thing that comes out.
7563520	7569520	Phoenix7726 in chat with a very good point saying the worry is streaming only and this
7569520	7571680	shit should not catch on long term.
7571680	7574800	Archiving will even be more of a nightmare than it already is.
7575360	7576160	That is true.
7576160	7578240	And it's a completely valid point, Phoenix.
7578240	7583520	I think the only issue is that this is kind of where the industry is going, whether we
7583520	7584240	like it or not.
7585120	7589360	You know, and it does also ask a question like, okay, so we've seen that the movie and
7589360	7592080	the TV industry has kind of gone this way, right?
7592080	7594320	But like, look at some of the stuff like Netflix.
7595200	7597520	What if Netflix goes ass up tomorrow?
7598080	7600880	Where are we going to be able to watch things like Stranger Things?
7600880	7608080	Now, Netflix has done some limited DVD and Blu-ray type of releases, especially for their
7608080	7611040	big shows like the one I just mentioned there, Stranger Things.
7611040	7614160	You know, you can still get that on a more traditional DVD, Blu-ray.
7614160	7618080	Same thing with things like Star Trek Discovery and people who haven't wanted to pony up for
7618080	7622720	CBS All Access or whatever it's going to be called now, the Paramount, Paramount Premiere
7622720	7623600	or whatever they're calling it.
7625440	7626000	There's that.
7627200	7630720	But I'm not so sure that is even going to be the future.
7630720	7632320	That's more of a bridge.
7632320	7637920	What you're starting to see happen now is you're starting to see more nuanced streaming
7637920	7641440	services that offer some of the classic stuff.
7642240	7646880	Like there are free TV streaming services that show really old reruns.
7646880	7650960	You know, I'm not sure there's that streaming service yet where I can watch old episodes
7650960	7651840	of Mama's Family.
7652480	7653200	Maybe there is.
7654560	7655760	Is it on Hulu maybe?
7655760	7660080	It might be, but I think you're going to start to see more streaming services start to pick
7660080	7662080	up on that archival type of stuff.
7662960	7668160	And I think long term, gaming goes a similar direction.
7668160	7673760	In a way, you're starting to already see it with Antstream, which I know for whatever
7673760	7676320	reason still hasn't really launched in the US yet.
7676320	7680080	And their client is an on Xbox Series X, even though it's on Xbox One.
7680080	7682400	It's one of those kind of few things that doesn't exist on both.
7683040	7687440	But as somebody, you know, full disclosure, who backed the Kickstarter and got two years,
7687440	7694000	even though I'm in the US, I'm able to use Antstream and that is like a classics streaming
7694000	7694880	service.
7694880	7700240	So a lot of like, oh, I'm talking old ass fucking Spectrum games and Commodore 64 games
7700240	7701680	you forgot about.
7701680	7702720	They're on Antstream.
7703600	7705680	And I do like that service.
7705680	7711040	And I think there's going to be more like it that are going to archive some of these
7711040	7712000	older things.
7712000	7716080	There's always going to be some things that slip through the cracks, but just kind of
7716560	7719680	I guess that's my very long winded answer to that statement.
7719680	7721280	I'm not saying I like it.
7721280	7727040	I still like having physical collectibles, but Netflix is going to still release things
7727040	7729280	like Stranger Things and the must have stuff on Blu-ray.
7729840	7734640	But I think our industry is moving that direction and we have to be prepared that there is going
7734640	7739440	to be more and more that streaming once more of the bandwidth caps and some of these other
7739440	7741200	limitations allow for it.
7741200	7743520	That's that's where my head's at right now anyway.
7743520	7751600	So Phoenix 7726 says if they do it in tandem, then I have less of an issue, but I want download
7751600	7755760	still prominent and I want full physical media, not this half ass shit where we get or take
7755760	7756640	the GOG solution.
7757280	7763440	Phoenix 7726 says counterpoint physical media is far more prominent in movies and music
7763440	7765760	has DRM free downloads.
7765760	7766400	And that is true.
7766400	7770560	And limited run games is still making NES cartridges that are selling.
7770560	7772320	So there's always going to be a space for it.
7772320	7775200	But I think an important thing with movies.
7776320	7779920	This is a huge we don't know yet what's going to happen.
7780800	7785680	But the huge question mark in the movie industry is what's going to happen after the pandemic?
7786400	7791360	Once the back end that will have an idea in about a year because, you know, the vaccine
7791360	7793040	is going to start to get out there.
7793040	7796320	It will be safe to go to movie theaters again eventually.
7796320	7803200	But the question is, will people do it or will the release of Wonder Woman 84 on HBO
7803200	7809360	Max and Mulan on Disney Plus Plus, will that have proven to be more lucrative for the movie
7809360	7811440	industry than a traditional movie house?
7812160	7815440	I kind of hope not, because I still like going to the movies.
7816400	7821360	But that's I, Loki, do you do you see that that that could be a real, like, scary thing
7821360	7825360	for the movie industry is that are people even going to come back to the movie theater
7825360	7827360	once they've been able to watch Wonder Woman at home?
7828080	7830320	Yeah, I think people will will come back.
7830320	7830820	Yeah.
7831680	7837200	I well and I also come from a you know, you know, I have a long standing love love relationship
7837200	7840960	with like cult movies and old movie screens.
7840960	7842560	And I host Rocky Horror.
7842560	7845120	I've hosted a cult screening of Scott Pilgrim.
7845120	7848080	I was supposed to do clue the movie before the pandemic.
7848080	7850480	And now it's scheduled next year at some point.
7850480	7855040	And there's nothing like bringing a big group of people together to watch a bad movie.
7856000	7860560	But it's it will movie will movie theaters become a novelty?
7860560	7862240	Have they become too?
7862240	7865520	Are there too damn many movie theaters to meet the demand?
7865520	7866080	I don't know.
7866080	7870560	These again, these are all questions we were going to find out the answer to in the coming
7870560	7871060	years.
7871520	7872320	So, yeah.
7872320	7872480	Yeah.
7872480	7877200	And Phoenix 7726 says also drive ins apparently did well during summer.
7877200	7879200	So this could be a time for an interesting rebirth.
7879200	7879840	Absolutely.
7879840	7884080	They are always threatening to close that drive in theater here in Sacramento every
7884080	7884560	fucking year.
7884560	7886560	I hear a story they're going to do it anymore.
7886560	7888000	I don't think they're going to do it anymore.
7888800	7890720	I really don't this this year.
7890720	7895360	If anybody made money, it was that that place because they were going to they were going
7895360	7896240	to get there in years.
7896880	7899280	I would say that they probably need to upgrade it, though.
7899280	7903920	They were going to tear it down and replace it with a traditional movie theater on the
7903920	7904720	same land.
7904720	7905840	That's what they were going to do.
7907040	7907680	I remember that.
7907680	7910240	And he has a century promenade century promenade.
7910240	7910740	Yeah.
7911220	7914660	Now the question is, are they still is that is that going to be the cost effective idea?
7914660	7916820	And I think the answer is no, it is not.
7916820	7919940	I think people are now have now found out there is a place for drive ins.
7921060	7922900	We wanted to do Rocky Horror at the drive in.
7923780	7925540	But it didn't it ended up working out happening.
7925540	7925940	They did.
7925940	7932420	They did a I think they like showed the movies at drive ins this last Halloween, I think.
7932420	7936820	But it ain't Rocky Horror if they're in a cast and all the other stuff that goes on
7936820	7937300	with it.
7937300	7938260	It's not the same.
7938260	7939220	But yeah.
7940420	7942420	So yeah, Questbuster says, I hear the same thing.
7942420	7944660	Drive ins have gotten very popular because the pandemic.
7944660	7946180	It's the only safe place to do shows.
7946180	7948260	They're doing drag shows at drive ins now.
7949780	7950900	It's the only safe place.
7952100	7957780	The political rallies that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were doing were at drive ins.
7958420	7959540	It's fascinating.
7960100	7966100	So anyway, just it'll be very interesting to see what happens in a year.
7966100	7968500	Is everything going to go back to normal in that regard?
7968500	7972100	Or have some of our entertainment consumption needs changed?
7972100	7972660	I don't know.
7972660	7974420	Anyway, good tangent, you guys.
7976820	7978020	Listener roundtable time.
7978020	7980660	Well, that was a good little side topic.
7980660	7985300	If you guys have any other questions or things to ask about or discuss here, send them in
7985300	7988740	our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
7989300	7991860	We would also open the mailbag at this point in the show.
7991860	7996260	If you want to send us an email, participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to
7996260	7996900	send emails.
7996900	8000260	Unfortunately, this week, no emails, sad face.
8000260	8004180	So participate at orange lounge radio.com if you want to send us something for next
8004180	8004900	week.
8004900	8007380	But I will ask if there's any last minute stories.
8008020	8009140	Loki, did you catch anything?
8009940	8010340	Yes.
8010340	8012500	So there was one thing.
8012500	8021940	And so apparently, uh, this guy goes by the name of Doppley has released a remake of the
8021940	8024420	two Zelda CDI games.
8024980	8028660	So he's remade faces of evil and one of Gamelon.
8028660	8029160	Why?
8030500	8031140	I'm just kidding.
8031140	8032500	Worked on for four years.
8032500	8032820	Wow.
8032820	8038340	Release them and then took them down, uh, because of, uh, I think he's worried about
8038340	8040260	game suit or something like that.
8040340	8042100	But, uh, they're out there.
8042100	8045780	If you know where to look for them, he put them up long enough for people to get.
8045780	8046020	Yeah.
8046020	8048020	Alan was telling me about this before the show tonight.
8048020	8051620	So, um, I know this is the thing that's going around and it's, so it's, it's not an
8051620	8054340	emulator for the CDI disks.
8054340	8054980	It is.
8054980	8059140	I ripped things from the CDI disks and built this in game maker, basically.
8059780	8060580	Basically.
8060580	8060980	Yeah.
8060980	8061480	Yeah.
8062020	8066420	Bobby Black Wolf with the plug for awesome games done quick saying wand of Gamelon will
8066420	8067460	be part of that.
8067460	8069540	I thought it was awesome games done quick.
8070900	8071400	Yeah.
8071780	8072340	Just teasing.
8072340	8072740	Oh yes.
8072740	8074500	Well, there is the awful block.
8074500	8074660	Yeah.
8074660	8075540	It's part of this.
8075540	8076980	I think, I think they call it silly.
8076980	8078020	Is it silly games?
8078580	8083780	They call it, they, they call it something that's not like demeaning to the games.
8083780	8084980	They call it silly game.
8084980	8085860	Oh, silly games is.
8086500	8087780	Oh, it is awful games.
8087780	8088500	Well, all right.
8088500	8090020	Then it's starting the awful block, I guess.
8090020	8090180	Yeah.
8090180	8095940	It's awful block because they have like, uh, Superman 64 and the CDI games.
8095940	8099140	And, um, I'm trying to think of some of the other ones.
8099140	8104500	I don't know if Pepsi man is part of the awful block, but it, you know, a lot of silly stuff
8104500	8105000	like that.
8106260	8106980	Uh, Dr.
8106980	8111060	Tia says if Nintendo goes after it, would that count as acknowledging the CDI Zeldas?
8111060	8113220	Ooh, it does put Nintendo in an interesting paradox.
8113220	8113720	Doesn't it?
8115940	8119300	I think they'd still have to probably shut it down out of, you know, protecting their
8119300	8123060	trademark and that whole thing and making sure they never make a deal like that again.
8124100	8124580	Sorry.
8124580	8125700	Like no fan games.
8126660	8128500	It's like, no, this was actually official.
8128500	8129000	Oh.
8129940	8134900	Um, so I referenced it earlier in the show, but I'll mention here during last minute stories.
8134900	8141380	Uh, there was that whole kerfuffle going on with, uh, Uri, Uri Geller, the, the, you know,
8141380	8146020	the guy he goes on, goes on TV and does like, um, like, uh, I think he was bigger in the
8146020	8147380	seventies and eighties.
8147380	8152900	He's basically a magician, but he claims to be, you know, tuned into the psychic stuff
8152900	8153860	and Ben spoons.
8153860	8154660	That was his big thing.
8154660	8155700	You like Ben spoons.
8155700	8156420	Oh yeah.
8156420	8157140	Remember that guy?
8157700	8162980	He had, they had a show, he had a reality show phenomenon.
8162980	8168740	I think it was called, I remember it because that guy, Chris angel, who is really unpleasant
8168740	8169540	was on it too.
8169540	8175380	And like him and a contestant like fucking fought, which I thought was weird, but yeah,
8175380	8176340	that was Uri Geller.
8176340	8184100	Anyway, the point is he had apparently got into it when Nintendo, like 20 years ago over
8184100	8189380	the character Kadabra, you know, there's Abra, Kadabra, Alakazam.
8189380	8195220	Well, Kadabra has a spoon and then the anime and shit, like he does, like he has the spoon
8195220	8201220	of his, and apparently the Japanese name is something like Uri Geller or something.
8201220	8204100	It's like something that's very similar to the guy's name.
8204100	8209540	So like Nintendo basically kind of had to admit, yes, it was partially inspired by him.
8209540	8214500	And so they took the character, Kadabra has not been in the anime since then.
8214500	8217140	They don't even have the cards anymore and all this.
8217140	8222020	Well, this past week, Uri Geller basically said, I'm dropping it.
8222020	8223540	I, and he apologized.
8223540	8226180	He's basically saying, I'm sorry for this 20 year old issues.
8226180	8227780	I'm now lifting the ban.
8227780	8230900	And if Nintendo wants to remake the card, they can, but they're going to have to do
8230900	8231060	it.
8231060	8234660	I imagine it will make the cards more valuable, LOL basically.
8234660	8238020	And so not sure what brought him to have a change of heart.
8238740	8241380	Perhaps he had a grand kid or a kid or something.
8241380	8242260	Say something about it.
8242260	8242660	Maybe.
8242660	8243060	I don't know.
8243060	8243780	It could be anything.
8244660	8248260	But yeah, it was kind of an interesting piece of news to come out of nowhere after 20 years
8248260	8251940	that, oh, the Pokemon Kadabra can exist again.
8251940	8253300	Thanks to Uri Geller.
8253300	8254260	So it's kind of interesting.
8254900	8256180	So that is interesting.
8256180	8256680	Yeah.
8257940	8262260	Act Deft in chat says like, it's good that he finally gave in, but it was pretty shady
8262260	8266100	of him to actually promote himself while having a change of heart.
8266100	8270820	Yeah, it a little bit, but he did have a change of heart.
8270820	8272260	So there's that.
8272260	8279460	Plus, a lot of things you have to really sell yourself when you're one of those types of
8279460	8279780	people.
8279780	8280340	You know what I mean?
8280340	8281620	It's about the personality.
8283780	8286660	Bobby Blackwell is pointing out the other games in the awful block.
8287300	8290820	Wand of Gamelon, King's Quest, Mask of Eternity.
8291460	8299300	Peanut Bee, Wings of Adventure, Epic Dumpster Bear 2, He Who Bears Wins, Snow White and
8299300	8300740	Happily Ever After.
8300740	8301460	Oh, God.
8302740	8303380	That's right.
8303380	8305940	Didn't they do a sequel to Snow White in the 90s?
8305940	8308980	And then they did a game based on it, and it was fucking awful.
8309940	8312500	I don't think it was a Disney thing either.
8312500	8315780	I think it was like the rights to the book became public domain or something.
8315780	8316280	I don't know.
8316760	8320680	Anyway, yeah, because the same thing happened with Oz.
8321960	8326840	Disney got the rights to Oz, and they made Return to Oz, which was not well received.
8327400	8333080	But if you were a kid in the 80s like me or Loki, that movie scared the shit out of me
8333080	8334200	when I was a kid.
8334200	8337160	That was a fucked up thing to show kids in the 80s.
8337160	8345960	When you start a movie with asylum and shock therapy, and then a woman that was able to
8345960	8349160	take off heads and stuff like that, it's a little creepy.
8349160	8350520	That was creepy.
8350520	8351480	Anyway, yeah, exactly.
8352200	8353080	And let's see the other game.
8353080	8355560	Sorry, we got a tangent thanks to the Snow White sequel.
8356520	8359720	Alcatraz Prison Escape and Mr. Bones.
8360760	8361480	So there you go.
8361480	8365400	And Bobby confirming that the Snow White game was a Super Nintendo game.
8365400	8369080	Yeah, that's about the right time frame, because I think I remember being in high school, and
8369080	8370360	it was like a big ass deal.
8370360	8374280	They were releasing a sequel to Snow White, but I don't think it was Disney.
8374280	8377560	It was another company that did it, and it was garbage.
8377560	8379560	It was a garbage movie.
8379560	8381240	It was really bad.
8381240	8384360	So anyway, all right.
8385240	8386920	Any other last minute stories?
8386920	8389800	If you guys have any questions for us in chat, now's a good time to shout it out.
8392360	8394760	No, I didn't really have anything else, I think.
8394760	8395800	Okay, that's fine.
8397800	8400120	Let's see, looking at some other comments in chat.
8401000	8403720	Bobby's saying it was obviously the overnight block.
8403720	8408280	With my luck, that will be one of my shifts, because I said I like Sierra games.
8408280	8409560	You know what, Bobby?
8409560	8412360	I would be honored to do the King's Quest Mask of Eternity.
8412360	8415240	I, it's bad, yes.
8415240	8416120	Is it awful?
8417480	8418520	I don't know, maybe.
8418520	8419400	I don't know.
8419400	8424920	I think, Bobby, if you get King's Quest, I think you should smile and accept that.
8424920	8427880	All right, let's see.
8428840	8430840	Some folks talking about Pepsiman.
8430840	8431880	Oh, thank you, Rama.
8431880	8432920	Rama found it.
8432920	8440520	MeTV is the streaming service with mama's family at metv.com.
8441240	8441640	Thank you.
8443320	8449240	ActDeft in chat says, in Mexico, video game news, the Mexican government is finally releasing
8449240	8453480	their version of the ESRB, and it's like, really?
8453480	8454920	Wow, that did take a long time.
8454920	8456280	That was a little bit delayed, wasn't it?
8456920	8458200	All right, awesome, awesome.
8459400	8460360	All right.
8460360	8463960	Anyhow, all right, I think that's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
8463960	8467560	Thank you guys very much for tuning into our show this week, whether you listen live here
8467560	8472760	at Twitch, or you downloaded us on the podcast feed on iTunes or Spotify, or most of the
8472760	8475080	places where you can find podcasts, we really appreciate it.
8475080	8475880	Thank you.
8475880	8476920	Help us spread the word.
8476920	8479640	Tell a friend or two about our show.
8479640	8482680	Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if
8482680	8485560	the voices aren't here to put out on air, then you don't have them here.
8486280	8491720	So thank you again to those of you that are here, those of you that auto host us on Twitch.
8491720	8492520	Thank you, thank you.
8492520	8494120	That goes an awful long way.
8494120	8496680	Thank you to all the new follows and bits and subs.
8496680	8499880	I'll acknowledge those after the credits tonight here on Twitch.
8499880	8501560	And just thank you for being here.
8501560	8505240	I know it was a busy week with the holidays, so appreciate you guys still being here tonight
8505240	8508040	and making room for OLR at your dinner table.
8509320	8511640	With that, I think we'll go around and get final thoughts.
8511640	8513240	Oh, before I do, though, I have to mention this.
8513240	8516760	My God, I should have mentioned this at the top of the show and I forgot, but I want to
8516760	8519560	make sure here at the end, I acknowledge our shop.
8520440	8521320	We have a brand new...
8521320	8525880	I know why I didn't say it because we said it a lot last week and we were kind of like,
8525880	8527640	okay, you don't have to sell it so much.
8527640	8534120	But I do want to mention over at the VOG Network shop, over at vognetwork.com slash shop, we
8534120	8536600	now have some OLR related items.
8536600	8540440	And Loki, again, you're finding this out here because I just put them up about an hour before
8540440	8541240	we went on air.
8541240	8548280	But your OLR pixel art that became an Xbox official avatar years ago, which sadly you
8548280	8549320	can no longer get.
8549320	8555160	But that OLR pixel art is now available as a sticker so you can make anything OLR.
8555160	8555960	It's one of those nice...
8555960	8559960	It's actually cut in the shape of the OLR logo with like a white border around it.
8559960	8561320	So it's a really nice looking sticker.
8561320	8562520	I kind of want to get one of those.
8562520	8563800	So you can make anything OLR.
8563800	8567480	And we have some OLR pixel art shirts and you can put them on.
8567480	8570360	And I picked a different shirt than the VOG shirts.
8570360	8573720	They're a little more expensive, but they kind of look like a baseball jersey.
8573720	8575080	I think they look kind of cool.
8575080	8577320	So we'll see if anybody takes interest in those.
8577320	8579000	I'm totally getting one of those.
8579000	8579500	Yeah.
8580520	8580760	Yeah.
8580760	8585160	Act Def says, I still have that OLR Xbox avatar on the Xbox profile.
8585160	8585960	Me too.
8585960	8587480	Thank you guys that still rock that.
8587480	8588040	There is a...
8588040	8589880	There's a Bobby Black Wolf one out there too.
8589880	8592280	But again, you can't download them anymore.
8592280	8593080	They were...
8593080	8596200	And it has nothing to do with the fact that we aren't on all games anymore because that
8596760	8599480	that it was a pack of all games.
8599480	8603960	All the shows on all games at the time had like a gamer pic that went to Xbox Live.
8605000	8610120	And they just, they pulled it after like four years or something like that.
8610120	8612440	So it was available for a long time, but sadly not anymore.
8614200	8617720	Very few, what was I gonna say?
8617720	8621880	Very few of the people are even rocking the old school type of avatars.
8621960	8627800	Because ever since Xbox released their version of the Miis, their avatars,
8627800	8630040	that's kind of what a lot of people use now.
8630040	8632680	So it's very, very rare you see the old school stuff.
8633720	8639400	And SSJ100 Matt says, please put the stickers on personal items and not random folks property.
8639400	8643720	Yes, please do not use the sticker as graffiti because that just makes us look bad.
8643720	8644680	So thank you.
8644680	8647800	Akuma JP says, need an OLR mug.
8647800	8648520	It's coming.
8649160	8649640	Wait.
8649640	8655800	I'm waiting for Loki to finish the VOG pixel art that matches the OLR one,
8655800	8660840	because we're gonna do a mug that has OLR on one side and VOG on the other, both in pixel art.
8660840	8661560	So that is coming.
8661560	8662200	I'll work on that.
8662200	8662700	It's coming.
8663320	8663820	All right.
8666360	8666680	All right.
8666680	8667240	That's it.
8667240	8668440	We're gonna wrap up.
8668440	8669560	Oh, we didn't get final thoughts.
8669560	8669880	Sorry.
8669880	8670120	Sorry.
8670120	8672200	I just remembered to put that plug out there.
8673000	8674360	We are gonna make a mug.
8674360	8678120	Pixel Pacas, there is a Bobby Black Wolf mug available in the store right now, however.
8678120	8681640	And, you know, Bobby is absolutely worthy of showing support too as well.
8681640	8683640	So, uh, uh, check that out.
8683640	8685160	Anyway, vognetwork.com slash shop.
8685160	8685400	Okay.
8685400	8685800	I'll stop.
8685800	8687480	I'll stop, uh, the advertisement.
8688040	8689160	Let's get to final thoughts.
8689160	8689660	Loki.
8690760	8698280	Um, so I'm just gonna be working on my game this week and I still shooting the launch this year.
8699320	8699640	All right.
8700440	8704120	My final thought is, uh, the new Pokemon go level should be this week.
8704120	8707320	So I hope I hit 41 by next week.
8707320	8707800	We'll see.
8708120	8709400	We'll catch up on the show.
8709400	8711320	Uh, stay safe, everybody.
8711320	8715240	If you did have a big Thanksgiving out there because, um, you just, you weren't able to
8715240	8719720	get out of family obligations, even though there's a pandemic going on, um, please, uh,
8720520	8723000	limit your interactions out there in the real world.
8723000	8726360	Uh, at least 10 days, really 14 is even better.
8726360	8731640	Um, please do your part to help stop the spread of COVID-19 because it's, it's everywhere.
8731640	8734360	You guys it's, it's pretty, uh, pretty scary.
8734360	8738760	So, um, you know, if you have to stick to yourself and play some video games for a couple
8738760	8741160	of weeks, there's really never been a better time.
8741160	8742680	So, uh, that's it.
8742680	8743880	Stay safe, everybody.
8743880	8748520	We'll be back in seven days to talk more video games and more stuff here on OLR.
8748520	8749720	Jamie will be back.
8749720	8753240	We have the, uh, exciting straight shit from YYR games.
8753240	8754680	So very excited to get that as well.
8754680	8757880	So it's going to be a busy December here at VOG Network and OLR.
8757880	8758760	Have a good night, everybody.
8758760	8759720	We'll see you next time.
8759720	8760220	Bye.
