00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What do you do when multiple studios creating new and remastered content for a single IP starts running dry? You add a level of recursion! Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War sets the stage for a future Call of Duty Ultimate World of Warfare 5 Zombie Aliens

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I just bought 33 titles and one remaster in name in less than two decades is astounding and might give Mario a run for his money.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
At least one of your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki has deep knowledge of one of the Call of Duty titles.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's Loki by the way.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And they'll talk about this game and the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio back again tonight with episode number 833 for this August the 23rd of 2020.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Joining me tonight via the magic of Discord.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We used to love doing this show in the same room as we did for many, many years.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But be that as may with the state of the world we're taping over Discord.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So joining me on Discord down below there is Techmaster Loki.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hi Techmaster Loki, how are you?

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hello.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Good to see you.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Pretty good.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Alright.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Good, good.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And you're playing the Secret of Monkey Island or somebody else's?

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not playing anything yet.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's a long play of Secret of Monkey Island.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's a good choice.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's a good choice for your backdrop tonight.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Appreciate that.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Alright.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And a big welcome back tonight to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers up there.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Sorry.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm Vegeta tonight.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm Space Dad.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm kidding.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Looking fabulous with your wig as always.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah I don't know if I like this one.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It needs some zhuzh.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This is fresh out of the box Cher style he may cut.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You know.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's got a little bit of that Dog on Rope a Bear vibe to it with the whole black and white.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh Monokuma.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Actually it's pink and white.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's pink and black.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It looks a little you know because your camera is a little you know older so I think it looks

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
a little more like white.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's actually not older.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's fucking cheaper.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh okay.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Well you said it.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I didn't.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'll admit it.

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Thanks Wish.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Thanks for my five dollar webcam yo.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hey you know what?

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Sometimes you have to make cheap things work and on a somewhat related note this isn't

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
about video games but Dark Sakura and I you guys know we love to talk about drag and actually

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I would argue in some ways video games can be a form of drag especially like MMOs and

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
role play and flesh character.

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's all drag.

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Anyway we're all born naked in the rest of this drag right.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Exactly.

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But I would be remiss not to.

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And I am.

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I do drag.

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You do.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You do.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
As a nun.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I did.

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I did once for a stage play one time.

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But anyway I would be on a serious note I would be remiss not to say anything about

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
the passing of Chichi Devane this week and I wouldn't expect all of our listeners recognize

68
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
that name.

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But anyway anybody that has a familiarity with RuPaul's Drag Race or heck the pageant

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
scene in the southern drag scene most certainly knows the Louisiana queen of the bayou Chichi

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Devane who unfortunately left this left this earth this week at the age of 34.

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Not COVID and I feel weird I have to say that.

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It was pneumonia resulting from previous kidney failure.

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah it was pneumonia due to her prior existing health conditions but obviously 34 is way

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
too young of an age but you know.

76
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It really is.

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I cracked a little line there about sometimes you have to make cheap things work and I think

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
that's something that you know that was a presence that Chichi brought to the show was

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
that.

80
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
She came out in garbage bags both times.

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
She didn't have a huge budget but she made it work right.

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So I think that was a great value that we could take from somebody like that.

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And I will go on record that her lip sync in the first season was my second favorite

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
ever Drag Race lip sync.

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
My first favorite being the Raja and Jujubee.

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Right.

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
When they did me anything on my own and started crying.

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Raven and Jujubee.

89
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That was Raven sorry.

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I always think Raven and Raja so you know.

91
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But yeah I just I just wanted to tip my hat and acknowledge that I mean it's just a horrible

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
loss for that community and you know just send our well wishes to her family and her

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
friends and you know one of the big lines that we get from Drag Race is that you know

94
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
we get to choose our family and so there are many many many people I'm sure Chichi had

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
no shortage of brothers and sisters and cousins and and so forth so I'm sure a lot of

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
people really really feeling a hole in their heart this week so.

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Oh and on top of that for me I mean she's from Shreveport Louisiana where I would spend

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I mean I've been to shout out to Coast Con and Shreveport you know I would go to Coast

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Con a few times when I was in my con circuit in Alabama and it was just really nice

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
seeing someone kind of from my edge of the swamp and I like to say and I was really

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
you know I was rooting for her all season.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yeah I know.

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You know she's up there in my top tier of Queens she was just so much fun and it felt

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
really nice to see you know a deep south queen you know that wasn't from Texas.

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And admittedly if you were to go back and listen to older episodes of reading is fundamental

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
which was a show I did about that show I was a little harder on her.

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But you know I just she was slaying on my faves in those lip syncs so maybe I was just

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
a little bit bitter I don't know.

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That upside down lip sync.

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah yeah but you can also recognize a TV show is very very different from a person

111
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and just as a person certainly whatever your thoughts about that little contest that's

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
televised just just a really wonderful sweet person that was just genuine and in it for

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
all the right reasons it's great.

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah she was she was really really I mean she was great to meet in person so she was

115
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
she was a delight.

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
All right rest in rest in power my friend.

117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
All right let's move on though we do want to get into talking about what is going on

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
with video games and that industry that we love to to take our minds off of all the horrors

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
of the real world and all of these these horrible passings before their time and fires

120
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
burning nearby which by the way OLR is nowhere near that we're only feeling the effects of

121
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
the smoke which is but I mean we're all staying indoors anyway so although I heard we did

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
have a brush fire not far from my house oh no right off of right out well I'll go ahead

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and say it because nobody except from here is going to know where it is but off of Franklin

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
oh yeah apparently a grass fire and that's what shot out into my area and your area to

125
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
make it worse.

126
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That's where my uncle lives.

127
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I hope everything is OK.

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm just finding that out now.

129
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So I will have to investigate that.

130
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So yeah because that's the eye and that's all very rural out there.

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
That's like hood Franklin Road right because I always joked my uncle was from the hood

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
because you go one way off that street to go to hood and what there is literally a town

133
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
called Hood and another way to go to Franklin.

134
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Wow.

135
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
OK well and but I mean I would say probably one of the nicer areas off of Franklin over

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
in Elk Grove.

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So you're actually in like populated area.

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah.

139
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Not in the countryside Elk Grove.

140
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But that's a country but the countryside is where.

141
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yeah.

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So anyway.

143
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
OK.

144
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeah.

145
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But it's it's pretty nasty outside.

146
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
This is the first time I've come close to having an asthma attack since I got over the

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
pneumonia.

148
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah it was really nasty outside.

149
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
No outdoor gaming for me today.

150
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That's for sure.

151
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Let's get ash in the air.

152
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Let's get into the kickoff topic though.

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And Loki I'll ask you to kind of lead us on this topic.

154
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And this has to do a little more with gaming culture I suppose.

155
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
This is kind of a twitch related topic but as we're using twitch to come together and

156
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
play games online I think more so than ever with everything that's going on in the world

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
this certainly still relates to our industry right.

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yeah it's kind of it's sad to see something like this.

159
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm sure that the company.

160
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I don't even know how you pronounce this.

161
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'll go be.

162
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Does it matter.

163
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Some media company a marketing company that was working with Burger King did this campaign

164
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
called The King of Stream.

165
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
OK.

166
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Oh we'll be.

167
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah it doesn't matter.

168
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't want to put any effort into getting that right since their campaign was very low

169
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
effort as well.

170
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Well we're about to drag them and expose them so it doesn't matter if we get it right.

171
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It doesn't matter.

172
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So what they did was you may know watching several twitch streamers you may know that

173
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:15,000
some streamers will have kind of a voice to chat text to speech type thing when they receive

174
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
donations and it'll have like a little message when you typed out with the donation stuff

175
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and it'll read it.

176
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
SSJ 100 Matt has subscribed for three months and says shout out to clicky the pan.

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I think your show is great.

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Hello L. Mr. Smoosh meow meow.

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Which is why we don't do that in our show.

180
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That would be a train wreck.

181
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Right.

182
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I don't want to shade anybody that does that.

183
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You do what works for you and like for accessibility reasons too.

184
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That could be a damn useful plug in.

185
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So but obviously we're trying to it's worth saying we're trying to do a podcast that you

186
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
know and that's why we don't do the typical acknowledgments of subs and everything until

187
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
the very very very end of the show after we end the recording.

188
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And it's not that we don't appreciate it any less.

189
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's just we realize that unfortunately this is like I can I can now use this as something

190
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
to point to and go.

191
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
This is why we don't do it.

192
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So what they did is they basically they created a box or did something where they found certain

193
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
streamers that had very minimal like set up basically just like a headshot that they could

194
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
crop out and gameplay none of the like complicated interfaces and everything that they would

195
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
have normally on there.

196
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And then they use this text to speech functionality to post advertisements for Burger King on

197
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
these streams and then they captured as part of their web campaign which is ridiculous

198
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
because there's so many things wrong with that with new different streamers may have deals

199
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
with certain brands and that may go against those deals.

200
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Also you know a lot of these folks if you want to advertise on their streams I'm sure that they

201
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
would love to be able to work out some sort of marketing deal that would certainly be worth

202
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
more than five dollars.

203
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And so a perfect example just just to give a tangible example that there was a whole subway

204
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
promotion through Twitch not that long ago where subway was basically like I think they were

205
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
like absorbing some of the cost of subs or something where people were I think we were getting

206
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
the whole five dollars for a sub as opposed to 250 because and get it sub because what subway is

207
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
they and that's how you do it right a little play a dumb little dad joke there to tie it together

208
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
and that's I mean somebody in chat probably remembers the details better than I do but that was

209
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
through Twitch official everybody kind of knew it we all know the rules and it was a much better

210
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I think promotion.

211
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yeah.

212
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yeah and so there were originally when I saw this video I thought it was faked because the gameplay

213
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
that they show behind everything is obviously fake.

214
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That's what I thought too none of those games were real.

215
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I couldn't figure out what they did is they superimpose the actual live stream of the actual

216
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Twitch streamer and they put it on fake gameplay but it's actually real reactions and everything

217
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and there was one of the there's a few of the Twitch streamers actually posted like the actual

218
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
video from their streams showing this happening and like having like what they've cut out of it

219
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and stuff but it's just it's really shady it's it's a terrible campaign I thought originally they

220
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
did it just as kind of like I thought it was faked and I thought they did it for like outrage

221
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
marketing type of thing.

222
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yeah there's a lot of people thinking that in the beginning.

223
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yeah but apparently no it was actual streamers just a lot of you know smaller streamers which

224
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
that's horrible though like it's it's just exploiting them.

225
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So I think that this is fair game then as long as I dropped five bucks for you know a sandwich

226
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
or something over there I'm allowed to put whatever advertisements I want in their store.

227
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That that it's basically they've set the precedent so I'm allowed to do it now.

228
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You are allowed to stand you are allowed to stand up on the counter and scream whatever advertisement

229
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
you want unfortunately that may involve you getting escorted out of the store but you know

230
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
well and plus in these days and times you're not really eating inside the store anyway but you know

231
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I digress.

232
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yeah so yeah so yeah there was a video like was one of the streamers a rubber ninja had posted a

233
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
video on Twitch he was playing a Mario maker 2 and it was showing you know kind of it that part

234
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
wasn't included in their campaign but he got one of those messages and so he posted that

235
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
and to see you know kind of his reaction to it as well so it's just ridiculous.

236
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah it's kind of a low blow but I think it's also I mean this is a chance for the streaming

237
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
community to also kind of like learn something from this and be cautious about this because there

238
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
was a really good comment and I have yet to acknowledge and welcome the chat room I'm sorry

239
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
guys but we were doing an important dedication at the top of the show so I do want to say hello to

240
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
the chat because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern

241
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash v o g

242
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
network voice of geeks network and there's some really good comments in here for example no one

243
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
special 77 starts off with a comment saying TTS or text to speech can too easily be abused

244
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,000
to be honest sure as shit some shithead would use TTS to say something racist or otherwise

245
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:43,000
disgusting and yes because that sort of thing happened right here on OLR right here like three

246
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
weeks ago remember that we had all those people that suddenly started watching and they all had

247
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
nasty names that I wouldn't read on air but because we have the thing that ticks across the

248
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
bottom they some of those names got out and I'm sorry about that that was but that was a

249
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
learning experience for us and now I've learned how to shut that off instantly so if if if a

250
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,000
name like that sneaks through you better believe you're only going to see one so and so yeah

251
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
you're right that kind of stuff can be abused and I think this is a good wake up call for all the

252
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
streamers out there who are using that text to speech plug in do they maybe want to keep using it

253
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
and again you have to do what works for you but maybe there would be like a filter or I don't

254
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
know you have to use a mod team or something yeah I would think well with some of that I'm not

255
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
sure about the the text to speech stuff but I think with the donations I'm sure there's some

256
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
sort of chat filters and stuff much like how there's moderation I would assume that that

257
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,000
functionality still exists and if that sniper thing was kind of being exploited granted they

258
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
can set the minimums on those donations to be read out I think and that's when the bot was doing

259
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
it was bidding the minimum so five dollars was one of the more expensive ones but I think in

260
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
the video they have like one dollar and three dollars so you're getting a one dollar advertisement

261
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I mean that's kind of ridiculous and I could see like maybe if they did that like after like

262
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
contacting these people to do some sort of agreement but there's there's no sponsorship in

263
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
it wasn't disclosed it was a sponsorship deal or anything like that because it wasn't it was just

264
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:28,000
like basically this gorilla ad and I'm worried that like you know if this is successful like

265
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
you know we're gonna see a lot more abuse of this type of thing I don't know well I think you're

266
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
getting money you might not care I mean if especially if you're a smaller streamer but yeah

267
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
like it's still kind of shady though it's like well it even had in the video like they kind of

268
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
pointed out it's like well are you gonna just you know are we gonna do like a brand deal or

269
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
something are we gonna you're gonna sponsor me are you just gonna you're just gonna do this

270
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
nonsense to clarify though I see that there was a clarification on the article here saying that

271
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:11,000
apparently that David Madrid ran the campaign not necessarily all will be but not their main team I

272
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
guess they're associated somehow this David whatever shame on you whoever you are yeah it

273
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,000
doesn't matter it's just it's it's irritating though that they would do this and that

274
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,000
unsurprising I don't know I mean yeah I haven't seen has Burger King come out to even like say

275
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
anything about this and yeah but when did this break Friday it might not be out till Monday

276
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
yeah where's this like because this is like kind of I think there it wasn't like Burger King

277
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
tweeting this out it was this ad campaign was the ad campaign so I'm wondering where this is

278
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
you and SSG 100 Matt says shame on them for signing off on it talking about the burger chain

279
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
saying because ultimately they had to sign off on it because they had to approve the use of their

280
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
image you know this particular burger chain and again I hate giving them free advertising on the

281
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,000
show but it is worth mentioning I suppose this chain has thought outside the box with the gaming

282
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
industry a couple of times because yes this was crap and I think we all agree this particular

283
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
campaign was crap but let's not forget this was the same group or I don't know who did this ad

284
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
campaign but they did that genius Xbox 360 thing I mean that grant was probably 10 years ago at

285
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
this point but that was what brought us the sneak king and the bumper car game and all that stuff

286
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:39,000
that was actually that was rad and we all loved that so I I think it is worth saying not every

287
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,000
idea that burger chain chain has had has been awful this one is but it's a little bit I guess

288
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
maybe less surprisingly here they're trying to come up with these crazy ideas when you look at

289
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
the track record that they've done it before yeah like and I would say like if you want to even

290
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
talk about more recent success in kind of advertising like that look at KFC and what they're

291
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:08,000
doing like putting out fake games and stuff like that I would love a new set of Burger King games

292
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
to be honest even how cringy those were before that's what made them great like come on put some

293
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
more of those out again like I'm surprised that we don't see something like that or or you know

294
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
like a live stream where the king is playing games or something like that because I think they even

295
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
do have like Chuck E. Cheese or something like that is they have that kind of thing now so it's

296
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
like do something like that like just like lean full into that kind of stuff because that would

297
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
be funny and I think would give them more attention rather than we're gonna exploit some

298
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
people I mean that um orange right in chat says they also did that one commercial where they try

299
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:50,000
to get people's I've learned not to say these words on air so I'm gonna spell it a LEX A's to tell

300
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
you what the big where the big burger or what the big burger was or whatever it is so basically

301
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,000
you know virtual assistant yeah okay yeah hey virtual assistant you know tell me about this

302
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,000
and then the device goes off and I've had I've had people email this show saying you need to stop

303
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
saying things like and the the those things because my virtual assistant actually responded

304
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:28,000
to it we do we call them how close the next time I get a pet I'm gonna name it one of those no

305
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
and don't apologize orange right it was a good comment I just I those are the types of things I

306
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
have to filter is that oh yes I can't say a LEX A or it's actually gonna activate somebody's device

307
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:47,000
and it's so fun so you guys all know I've oh yeah I could that's a good idea yeah axilla okay

308
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:58,000
so my dad as you know I've been talking about the issues he's been going through he had a stroke

309
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
a few weeks ago and I'm really happy to report that he's made a virtual full recovery because

310
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
like the physical therapist actually even signed off like I have no need to come back you're doing

311
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:14,000
fine but my point is he got an Alexa well I'm sorry if I just activated it I guess I was too close to the real thing

312
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
axilla sorry um but he just got one of those and like he was like I was over there visiting and he

313
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:29,000
was like well you know the and he he points out he goes the the a LEX A but now he's actually kind

314
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
of using it for things but the point to get in one of those was it's it's kind of like the modern

315
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:41,000
equivalent of the I fallen and I can't get up is that if something happens to him he can say you

316
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:51,000
know you know who called an ambulance basically so anyway Oh Quest Buster says how about basically

317
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
getting to this point how about ax lay one of the greatest Super Nintendo shooters can call it

318
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:05,000
ax lay I like that point for you all right anything else to say about this crappy twitch campaign

319
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
and which I twitch is not involved with twitch is merely the mechanism being used to deliver it

320
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
and it's it's pretty shady but I think a lot of streamers now are probably going to be be evaluating

321
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:26,000
do I want this because do I want to be taken advantage by this so yeah I mean it's it's unfortunate

322
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
but like I'm surprised it hasn't been done sooner yeah I know I know yeah it is kind of surprising

323
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
we haven't seen it sooner so all right well let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks and the

324
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
types of video games that we have been playing this week so dark soccer I'll start with you you

325
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,000
have two weeks if you want I really it's really just been Animal Crossing and I finally beat my

326
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:59,000
stupid word find game like I did 1500 puzzles in it I played Orna I touched it did you really

327
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:12,000
congrats I did I did some stuff in it and you know I was also intoxicated but I I've I really need

328
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
to get back to the last of us it's just that with you know I've got some behind the scenes crap

329
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:24,000
going on you know medical stuff so I haven't really had like a whole lot of time and then

330
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:32,000
when I have had time I've just been really tired so but we did bust out the Saturn and Dan was

331
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,000
playing elevator action returns which you know he loves that game and so I'm thinking about busting

332
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,000
out grandia again but I found a place that does that applies the English translation patch and I

333
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:54,000
don't think I would need to use a modded Saturn for it so I have to check but I was going to see

334
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
about maybe getting the translated Saturn grandia because it blows the PlayStation one out of the

335
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
water you know the PlayStation one doesn't do like the same scaling the aspect ratio is a little

336
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:14,000
bit different the graphics are not as good believe it or not for 3d and I've also been looking

337
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:22,000
at picking up some of those Dreamcast titles the after release ones so I'm doing a little bit of

338
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
perusing but we've also got other tech stuff on hand so you're going to be seeing a lot more

339
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Apple arcade stuff coming for me I have been playing a lot of pattern but I don't go and say

340
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
this Dan and I are our 15th wedding anniversary comes up on September 1st oh wow that's right is

341
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
around the corner and since we're not going to New Orleans like the initial plan was because I have

342
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:57,000
some places to take him that's my old stomping grounds so instead we we took advantage of some

343
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:05,000
of some situations and we bought iPad iPad pros for ourselves yeah he needs the cellular one I

344
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
need a bigger hard drive so we got him a smaller cellular one we got me the bigger hard drive one

345
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I accidentally ordered two Apple pencils oops so but for me I'm going to use it as a graphics

346
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
tablet but I want to start doing a little bit more gaming on it just because I really think that

347
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:29,000
tablet gaming is absolutely the way that a lot of portable gaming is going to go sure you know

348
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
we've got a lot of us have switches and playing that portable that's great but we already knew

349
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Sony took their stab at it and it went I mean that to be so loud so I'm just I'm saying I want to

350
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I'm going to put a little bit more into the other types of portable gaming and maybe give some more

351
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
reports on it I would say if Sony went but it's only because Sony didn't invest in it long enough

352
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
like I just and and there were just a few key mistakes they made that really felt like they were

353
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,000
detached from it but I mean the hardware the cell the PSP was a great device and so was the video

354
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
like they were great devices they just they just made a few like really key errors that were

355
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,000
catastrophes I'll tell you with the Vita I actually like some of the games on it so much that I

356
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
just got a PSTV you know I got the PSTV so I could play Danganronpa Ultra Despair Girls

357
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
and then there was that Tempest thing that was by the guy that made Tempest 2000 right

358
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
there were a lot of good games that I could just play on my PSTV that were absolutely wonderful

359
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I actually do gaming now a little bit on my Apple TV I have the SteelSeries Bluetooth controller

360
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
and I've been playing Patterned on that I love Patterned

361
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I just have to shove in here this is a great point that Bobby Blackwolf is saying in chat

362
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I'm saying I'm considering getting a Samsung Galaxy tab for Project xCloud and that's a really good point

363
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
is that now you have a lot of like these streaming things that are you know going so it's like a tablet

364
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
can still let you play console games now I do understand there's issues with the whole Apple App Store

365
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:14,000
and the Microsoft platform and the Google state and all that I just I kind of tend to be on the side of

366
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,000
it will get worked out in the end because Netflix is there CBS All Access is there Spotify is there

367
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
and where all that stuff came through I do feel like it will come through eventually

368
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
it's just going to take a little time I think so even on those devices you named

369
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:39,000
no comment I know even on those devices you named you can potentially in the future play some type of streaming from a console

370
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:46,000
yeah but I only really care about the stuff I get an Apple Arcade I kind of want to keep those aspects separate

371
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:56,000
and actually I did play another game I'm in a beta I am in a beta for a game called Roll

372
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:04,000
that's it's put out by hold on I'm trying to find it again but yeah I got I'm in a beta called Roll

373
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:12,000
it's kind of like a build a deck sort of card game with dice and I haven't quite gotten the hang of it

374
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I think the rules are a little confusing of it but but I am doing it through the iPhone beta testing software

375
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I've got access to it so I've been really enjoying enjoying trying to get it the fuck figured out

376
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,000
it's a really pretty game just you know yeah it's called Roll for the Galaxy sorry

377
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:42,000
and I'll for those who are watching that's what my screen looks like so it's pretty neat so far

378
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I'm kind of kind of digging it once I can get it better figured out and I kind of miss this card game

379
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
so yeah that's the other thing I'm playing

380
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says we love Roll for the Galaxy and Estrinio and her mat is like can you talk about it

381
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
like is this actually something you're allowed to talk about right now

382
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:08,000
yeah this stuff it's like a public beta now the version I'm playing I have to go through the beta testing app

383
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:17,000
because the full version isn't out but yeah Bobby I'm gonna have to pick your brain for like how to make this work

384
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:24,000
so because I'm no good at it I haven't really got the concept of it yet so I might pick your brain about it

385
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
all right Loki do you want to go next

386
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:39,000
sure so I played a little bit of Orna this week I've been mainly just watching tutorials online for different game dev things

387
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I've been really focusing on a specific area and so I've been doing that

388
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
yeah that's all I can really say about that right now

389
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:59,000
and then what else I have a little bit of Minecraft I played Minecraft this week and I think that's about it

390
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:07,000
all right then I'll talk about my gaming week so for my gaming week a lot of the same stuff

391
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:14,000
still been playing final fantasy 14 because I always do and they brought back the yokai watch crossover event

392
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
so I was working on that and I got one of my mounts for getting all the minions so that's cool

393
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:26,000
it was really hard to understand how that stupid event works because you have to like use an item to get these metals

394
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
you use the metals to buy minions you use the minions to get certain weapons but you have to be in certain zones to get them

395
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,000
if it sounds complicated that's because it is but thanks to the lovely community there's some infographics that really helped break it down and explain it a little better

396
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
so I got through it so I'm up to having like three of those weapons so yeah

397
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:52,000
and let's see what else did I play this week as far as like old stuff you know the old standby stuff before the fires got crazy

398
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:00,000
between Ingress and Orna I hit 193 today level 193 in Orna it really like you can get through those first hundred levels pretty quick

399
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
and then it really starts to ramp up like the crawl from 175 to now has been very very slow

400
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:13,000
but that's good game design honestly because you don't want it to you know you don't want it to be a rush to the end

401
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
and then there's nothing to do because you're at the end and you're the most powerful player in the entire world

402
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
and a new game I played this week so yes I forced myself to play something new

403
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I bought this game based on all the positive things I was hearing about it when it showed up at a Nintendo event earlier this week

404
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:37,000
which we'll talk about later on in the show so you might piece it together the game I bought on PC is called Hades

405
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:45,000
and it is from Supergiant Games who did Bastion was like their big game and they did what was the other game called Pyre

406
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
and there's one other one too what's that Logang you're muted

407
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I was gonna say you didn't have it for free on the Epic Games Store because that was one of the first games that they offered

408
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,000
no I think I missed it whenever they gave it away on the Epic Games Store so I just bought it on Steam whatever

409
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:07,000
so yeah I hey I'm all about kicking some coin to the developer so I've been playing it on Steam

410
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:17,000
and yeah it's neat because it's kind of like a roguelike but it's a very kind of like cartoony looking game

411
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:25,000
but like in a cool way and it really like my computer's a couple years old it runs really smooth and it was just a really fluid

412
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I think that's a good way to describe it really like kind of like fluid type of action style game and yeah I was enjoying it

413
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,000
you know I kind of had to figure it out like how to do everything but I suppose sometimes games kind of make you do that

414
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,000
so yeah that's that's a game on PC that I've heard a lot of great things about from friends

415
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
because I know they were very hyped when they announced the Switch version was coming and it was going to carry over your progress from the PC

416
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:57,000
so I thought that was pretty cool so yeah so I checked it out so all right that was my gaming week so that's it

417
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:05,000
let's get into some other gaming news all right how about Loki you want to start us off with some gaming news

418
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:13,000
yes so there's always some sort of controversy going on and now of course we have E3 having to apologize

419
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:21,000
so the E3 twitter account which is owned by the ESA of course they had tweeted out you know like those

420
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:30,000
news is slow so let's tweet out something to keep our engagement up so they had great list of games women gamers are playing

421
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:40,000
any of your favorites making the cut and it was from an article by Parade which included a bunch of games

422
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:48,000
you know just like kind of cliche games I guess but they had like you know some ridiculous stuff like Bajool classic

423
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:56,000
because diamonds are a girl's best friend am I right ladies just kind of you know sexist stuff in there and apparently

424
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:04,000
the article was written by a woman but you know and maybe it was her it was sexism right there

425
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:14,000
yeah no I know I'm not excusing it but I think it is a point that you have to say but it was definitely like it might have been her 25 favorite games

426
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:22,000
which is fine and whatever reason she liked those games great but to project that on everyone else is ridiculous

427
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
anyway I'm sorry Loki I'll let you finish

428
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:34,000
no no and from my understanding that the woman who wrote the article actually I don't know if she was very familiar with gaming in general

429
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:42,000
because she had posted a tweet earlier that was saying hey I ran this article about gaming anybody can help me out with this

430
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:54,000
and no responses so maybe this was just kind of searching the internet for you know taking other top ten lists or something and kind of compiling that together

431
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I don't know it seems like kind of the filler piece that you would put out you know slow news type thing

432
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:10,000
which is exactly what Parade is by the way it's that insert in the Sunday newspaper that's what Parade is literally

433
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
so yeah it's literally filler content

434
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:20,000
so yeah so of course people were upset because you know it's a lot of cliches were in there and stuff and I don't know instead of

435
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:30,000
personally like I would have been like yeah okay bad articles bad you know I mean like just look at the source just like okay well these people aren't necessarily

436
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
it's not like otaku writing an article you know top games or whatever

437
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I don't go to Parade for my gaming news

438
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
exactly so this is the type of article I might actually expect out of Parade to be quite honest

439
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I don't know if we necessarily like need to jump down there perhaps you know ESA should have known better

440
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I mean maybe you get better people you know some folks that are better doing the social media thing

441
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:12,000
instead of just randomly tweeting stuff out maybe you know look over the links that you're you know make sure that the content doesn't seem like it's going to be something that you would want to offend a group of people with like I don't know

442
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:23,000
to make the problem with this very clear it's not the fact that the article exists that's a problem because again it's this you know it's just it's some you know filler piece that was written by Parade

443
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:40,000
it's the fact that E3 amplified it that they use their social media in their account to amplify it and basically say this is representative of women in gaming that is a huge problem huge problem

444
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:51,000
and you know and I almost wonder you know we brought up Drag Race earlier in the show and I'm sorry not sorry but I'm going to use another reference because I think it actually fucking applies here

445
00:36:51,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Dark Sakura do you remember when RuPaul got in a lot of trouble because of some of the there well and still is in trouble really because of the poor trans representation on RuPaul's Drag Race

446
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I mean granted we've had Gia gone and things like that you're muted yeah yeah I just noticed yeah no that's terrible that was some bullshit

447
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Do you remember when RuPaul in an attempt to save a little face went to her Twitter account and wrote a tweet saying the only criteria to be on our show is that you have charisma uniqueness and urban talent and then posted a flag

448
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:49,000
and do you know what flag that RuPaul posted on her Twitter account I do not remember that it was a trains flag what the bitch went to Google and googled trains flag

449
00:37:49,000 --> 00:38:05,000
t-r-a-i-n-s flag I'm gonna have to look that bullshit up because that's funny I mean this but if you know it's it's Tara it's like one of those like oh my god grandma stop you're making it worse like it's one of those type of situations

450
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:24,000
So anyway the reason why I bring that up and yes it is relevant here to E3 you're damn right I just tied RuPaul and E3 together because I bet E3 realizing oh today is the 100th anniversary of women getting the right to vote

451
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:47,000
you know what we should do we should post an article about women gaming let's go to Google women playing game and what do you want to bet I would bet you money that is what happened at E3 headquarters please note that is not excusing it that is not saying it was okay I'm just pointing out how stupid of a mistake it was

452
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:58,000
yeah and how you can't rely on way you rely on Google to do your social media work yes that's the first article that pops up

453
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Rob Roberts industry analyst they get please use my title please use my title moving forward

454
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I'm sorry I just had like a big oops and now my vehicle Voltron is missing his head act Efton chat says let Loki speak no it's my week to speak yes Loki can speak just the thing is is that I'm really tired of these tone deaf celebrities thinking that you know just because they have fame on their side that what they have to say is relevant and know the fuck not it's relevant you need to learn to shut your fuck up and know your role

455
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:57,000
you know I'm thinking of 25 games that women play I'm using my quote he fingers and I'm like you know clearly the people at E3 who probably didn't even read this article before posting it they do not know the same people that I know because I'm like where's where's Resident Evil

456
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:14,000
where's Dead by Daylight where's like all the murder games because maybe it's just the women I know but like there's a lot of you know what actually at the end of the day you know what games women are playing the exact same games as men and that my friends should have been the tweet

457
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:38,000
should have been the tweet so it's just a bunch of misogynist garbage because like we are 50% of the gaming population like that is a bona fide number and the fact that these you know little shits are out there and yeah I'm gonna I'm on a roll I'm gonna I'm gonna put my Voltron back together and explain a thing

458
00:40:39,000 --> 00:41:03,000
actually legit broke off that's sad anyway but at any rate what I was gonna say is that we are still fighting stereotypes that have been perpetrated not just in the video games but of course it's gonna bleed over because everything at some point was a man's domain

459
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:20,000
that's that was the thought you know but then you want to look actually more into the way history is gone women have been I'd say some of the oh gosh some of the truest innovators like I'm gonna actually throw out a historical thing out here you know where the word computer came from

460
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:49,000
where they would actually use humans to compute complex mathematical equations and at the beginning of the space race it was women specifically many women of color on top of it who were human computers hidden figures is all about right well part of it yeah you know but it was something that had gone on in plenty of other scientific fields too

461
00:41:49,000 --> 00:42:18,000
and then but now we have this thing where oh math and science is the man's thing blah blah blah or like Barbie I don't like math you know I mean but look at it we we like kind of the scary violent stuff I mean how many women do you know who know all about serial killers just saying and we ain't gonna play Resident Evil please and that whole thing's gotten even more in 2020 right because y'all are staying at home and watching Netflix Docs

462
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:48,000
for the record I am not a serial killer fan I just like watching unsolved mysteries and forensic files because I like forensic files I like I started off in college and geology that's what my sister does for a living so believe me I'm surrounded by it and I hate that stuff I hate it I hate it well but I like the science around it but but I mean like y'all have seen the games that I'm into and I am certainly not alone in it you know

463
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:59,000
like how how many times have I played through the Mass Effect trilogy how many times I played through Dragon Age what am I playing right now other than Animal Crossing you know

464
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:12,000
and that's why it's so irritating that this list comes out and it's like Candy Crush and I mean granted Animal Crossing was on it but any list in 2020 is gonna have Animal Crossing on it because it's what a lot of people are playing

465
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:32,000
men women non binaries everybody all ages all we're all every single one of us is playing Animal Crossing because it's the escapism that we have right now you know so I just it just it was the infuriating part of that is how E3 endorsed that and I was really mean on Twitter

466
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I don't get nasty to corporations on Twitter very often I don't but I went like I went full 11 Karen on the ESA because what I thought was very interesting it's the E3 tweet that went viral the ESA the actual organization that puts on E3 wrote the same thing and two people had replied to it I was one of them

467
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:15,000
and my reply was basically along the lines of how dare you represent this organization when you tweet tone deaf stuff like this and give this stuff a voice I don't maybe I could dig up my tweet but it was just basically like and that's where that's where my mind was that is that what what don't you don't you remember

468
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:38,000
when video games were for nerds were for people in mom's basement when video games were frowned on because only like people with social problems play video games because they have nothing else to do that's how a certain generation of individuals views video games and probably still does today

469
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I feel like a comment on here by someone who goes by Stephanie not a burrito I've been playing video games for 30 years and you're still going to reduce me to checks notes Kim Kardashian Hollywood adventure I hope someone loses their job over this garbage article

470
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:18,000
yeah and and it's just it infuriated me that the ESA is obviously being run by people in that same generation who think that you know gamers are shut ins and and social recluses and things like that well guess what everyone it's 2020 and in the year 2020 we believe that video games are for everyone

471
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:45,000
and that that is the message that a organization that claims to support this industry that takes this industry's money to represent their best interest that puts on this show that is supposed to be the pinnacle thing of our industry every year that's the message the ESA is obligated to communicate is that video games are for everyone

472
00:45:45,000 --> 00:46:11,000
so when they tweet out this tone deaf shit instead that is what is infuriating and by golly that is why the ESA is imploding and that is why E3 isn't happening it's not because of COVID it's because the ESA is a mismanaged organization and this is proof we need new representation in the video game industry

473
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I rest my case

474
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:36,000
it's, it's just more shit like that that makes it really hard to be a woman or demi woman or anyone on the female end of the spectrum of gender to still be taken seriously in gaming I mean I still get bullshit

475
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I mean and how long have I been fucking doing this show 18 years right. Mm hmm. You know I have friends of mine who are, who don't play online games anymore because of toxic little man children on the internet.

476
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:12,000
And then we have E3 who's supposed to you know like you were saying represent all the gamers pulling this no you're not making anything any easier for us we we play the same games the dudes do okay gaming knows no gender. Fuck off.

477
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:24,000
The ESA has still not apologized for the data breach of all the journalists and their personal information from E3. When is change going to happen at that organization.

478
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
It's time.

479
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
And until they make changes at that organization you can kiss E3 goodbye.

480
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Because it's not that it shouldn't happen. It's that it's going to fall up its own asshole so hard. It can't happen until they make changes.

481
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Am I wrong.

482
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:56,000
You're not wrong, but you remember what I told you about 2020 earlier today. Mm hmm. They can also eat a bag of rusty iron dicks.

483
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Just saying.

484
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Tiger claw linked.

485
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Thank you. I can always trust Tiger claw or dark Tetsuya in chat to be the live fact checkers. While the show is going. So here's what I said to the ESA and I believe this.

486
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:31,000
The fact that you'd retweet this shit article that belittles women gamers is that they can't play the same stuff as men is a great example of one. The ESA is a badly run org to your expo is fucked and was fucked before COVID ever showed up, delete this ad and delete your entire account by.

487
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:47,000
And then I followed that up with a tweet that said me walking into the next ESA board meeting, and it's a video clip of Heidi and closet from RuPaul's Drag Race on tucked going, fuck you fuck you fuck you and fuck you.

488
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Okay, so I'm actually making a tweet right now. I've been sitting on it for a while trying to decide what I want to say. Well, and I feel like I just want to say, I just before you send anything off, I just want to make sure you know.

489
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
E3 did pull the tweet and say we goofed.

490
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Yeah, so screenshot so I know we all got the receipts girl but E3 did pull the tweet and say our bad. Basically, um, yeah, that's, that's kind of not good enough.

491
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Yeah, you guys, not at all. There's a sweep under the rug movement you know it's it's basically garbage.

492
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:39,000
But what I said is here's my two cents on the E3 and their tweet gaming knows the gender women are 50% of the gaming community proven we play the same games the male end of the spectrum plays we play with non binary people play all genders play the

493
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
same pool of games kindly fuck off. Yeah.

494
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Video games.

495
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Attention ESA video games are for everyone. You put it on the flag, or you fucking get out of this industry.

496
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Because you your archaic views are no longer welcome in this industry.

497
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
They're not.

498
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:24,000
The people are no longer welcome at all, just no matter what they say people who are like that I need a flag, I need a flag. Do you hear that people sing, sing the songs of angry men and women and non binary individuals.

499
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I say humans.

500
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Anyway, yeah.

501
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
It's bullshit.

502
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Absolutely. All right, no we went off girl I know it's been it's been a nice novel will not sit still fine you want to sit in the front row you can sit in the front row.

503
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
All right, moving on.

504
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Why why are you asking, do you need a little Pokemon Sorry, oh you can't. You guys can't even see because that part of my screens cut off Nevermind then. All right.

505
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Do you need a trains flag. No, no we do not need a train spot my dad did work in trains for many years, and I'm sure he would appreciate it, but there's another community that needs our support, a little bit more right now and you're going to need to delete

506
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:18,000
one letter to make it. Oh my god I found the RuPaul tweet by the way that is some absolute bullshit is, isn't it one of those like grandma step away from the keyboard.

507
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Grandma stop grandma, grandma, please do not please do not tweet at the Olive Garden grandma, they're not listening. I reposted my tweet with correct grammar so just saying.

508
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:43,000
All right, I'm going to move on to the next story just in the interest of time because we'll be here all night screaming at the ESA. All right, um, let's talk about some movement forward in our industry, shall we, and let's talk about Microsoft redoing the user

509
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:56,000
interface on the Xbox series x of course, and this is going to be something that will trickle down to Xbox one, and also going to impact what game pass will look like on PC as well as well as even Xbox on mobile.

510
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:09,000
So it's kind of like a unified interest interface across all of those platforms. So they showed some pictures of what it will look like it has some elements of a familiar looking crossbar, but I'm not going to say it's copy because it's very much not, they're

511
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
definitely doing kind of a different little spin on it.

512
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:31,000
And it does seem to make a little more sense, certainly than what Microsoft was doing before, which, for better or for worse, the Xbox one interface was designed for connect the gamers pushed back on connect and connect was forced to be removed, yet the interface that was still

513
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:42,000
like a connect interface was kind of stuck. So this is the first time now that Microsoft can kind of reinvent without feeling like connect is there because it's it's not for most people now.

514
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:57,000
So anyway, they went on to say that gamer choice is a big part of this. And this also strikes me as something that's in the messaging for the Xbox series x about how you need to be able to like flip games on a dime, like I'm playing this game and then I'm gonna flip over here

515
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:18,000
and pick off where I was at here. It's kind of part of like what the solid state drive and all this does. But you notice that continued messaging and what they say. That means the way you manage your hardware and games, the way you find what you want to play next and the way you communicate and share with friends, whatever device you use, we aspire to deliver an amazing Xbox experience that keeps you connected to games and friends throughout your day.

516
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:34,000
And then they talk about instant welcome and however you choose to play. So whether you're alone on your console or getting friends together. So they're kind of like, you know, tying that sort of element together to make that easier to understand for when you have guests.

517
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:51,000
And then they're talking about Xbox assist also on the console. And then of course, again, selling that like kind of solid state drive, the Xbox series x will set a new bars for speed when it launches this November. And we're taking the experience to accelerate across Xbox.

518
00:53:51,000 --> 00:54:08,000
So I gotta say the Xbox interface, it does feel a little bit clunky. I think it's more the speed than anything that kind of bothers me about that interface. But PlayStation is just as bad if not worse, especially when you're trying to navigate the store.

519
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:32,000
So a nice bump in speed for hardware for both of these platforms is going to go a very long way. And it'll be kind of nice to see that everything is unified, you know, between all those different platforms. It also is bringing together the the PC environment and the Xbox environment even more so. So that's just going to make some people go even more. Do I really need an Xbox?

520
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Well, if you're paying for Game Pass, then Microsoft still loves you no matter what, right? Crystal Skies 80 in our chat says I just reset up my Kinect. I'm not saying Kinect is bad. I'm just saying the gamers rejected it, meaning they did not believe it should be included with the Xbox one.

521
00:54:53,000 --> 00:55:12,000
And to be fair, I think a big reason they rejected it is that the variety of Kinect and what it did in that interface in the Microsoft wasn't really sold very well. And the games, you know, it was a lot of dance games, a lot of fitness games. It never really broke that mold.

522
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Yes, you started to see things like Disneyland adventures and stuff that was doing different stuff. But there was nothing like, let's say, Wii Sports in the Xbox one environment specifically. I would say they did a very good job with a lot of that stuff when Kinect was on 360. But there was nothing on that level with Xbox one. But anyway, let's see some other comments here.

523
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:51,000
VGRealness says the PS4 interface is so slow. I don't understand why it's so bad. Yeah, I agree. Yyr in chat says granted, it hasn't really been tailored for Kinect in a while. This is an evolution rather than a major change.

524
00:55:51,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Yeah, I'm just saying that their base square that they had to start from had Kinect in it. So they were tied to that for a little bit until Microsoft was really free of that. And then they didn't really make a radical change from that. A lot of what you saw in that interface is still there. Yes, they made a lot of changes. But this is going to be a big change. But this is the time to do it, I think.

525
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:25,000
All right. Anyway, so I look forward to seeing how this is going to look on Series X and PC and all of that. So a new look for Microsoft coming later this year.

526
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:32,000
All right, moving on. Why don't we get to Dark Soccer? You have a follow up on some exciting stuff from this week?

527
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I do. And I watched it happen last night. I was so excited. So Summer Games Done Quick 2020 was all online. It was amazing. And I saw some fantastic runs and had to mute the audio a couple of times. But overall, Dan and I tried to watch most of it even. We even had it on while both of us were working.

528
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:08,000
So we're super happy to say that after the week, they raised over two point three million for Doctors Without Borders. That's great.

529
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:21,000
And of course, they've had some really big donations from Yeti and Fan Gamer, but they also were able to take bits. The little biddies were were added into that final total as well.

530
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:32,000
And so we watched it ended with Pokemon Shield, which, you know, it was a nice give you a watch. I kind of half watched watched it, too. I watched the beginning of it. I thought it was really neat.

531
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Had a lot of it going. I actually donated for the Half-Life Alex run, which then I tried to watch it and got like super motion sick.

532
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:49,000
But but it ended. They had hit the the incentive for the Isle of Armor.

533
00:57:49,000 --> 00:58:03,000
So that was pretty cool. And yeah, I was I sat there and watch that number roll over. It was pretty rad. And of course, that's going to just go to help so many people.

534
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:19,000
And I really think that doing it online this way. I mean, you know, we miss the couch. We miss the in-person, you know, banter and everything. But it gave a chance to a lot of people to do their hosting chops like Bobby.

535
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:28,000
It gave a lot of different runners a chance to participate in it who might not have been able to come out otherwise.

536
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:35,000
You know, a very good point that came out about that run that Bobby was hosting the Devil May Cry 4 run, which was great. I watched that whole thing.

537
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Bobby did a great job as host, even despite the technical hiccups that happens like he he just he did his job very well.

538
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:49,000
All the commentators were on fire. They were doing a very good job. But Bobby was very good at when he was called on. He did his thing.

539
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:54,000
He just popped in and out just like he's supposed to do and let the commentators get back to it. And none of his jokes.

540
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I mean, he definitely prepared jokes, but they didn't feel forced. I thought he did a very, very good job. So props to him.

541
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:08,000
And I think it's it's weird to hear that a massive chat room actually responded positively to him because I associate so many chat rooms like garbage comments.

542
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:16,000
So I wasn't even in there, but some of our other VOG fam were in there and said Bobby got was well received and he earned he earned it.

543
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:22,000
So congratulations. But the point I want to make with the whole virtual thing, that whole Devil May Cry 4 run and how well received it was.

544
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Well, the speed runner for that was a Russian guy. And if the thing had been in person, you know, just with the state of the world being as it is and the fact that just getting here from Russia is going to be expensive anyway.

545
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
He may not have been able to attend an in-person event. I don't know his life.

546
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Maybe he could. But let's you know, let's say that there probably are some speed runners that couldn't do it if it was in person.

547
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,000
So the virtual event lended itself well to that. But I don't think I don't think it should all be.

548
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Yeah, absolutely. And I don't think it should all be virtual.

549
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Well, obviously during covid, it's going to have to be. But, you know, long term, you know, the four years from now.

550
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I think the nice thing will be maybe there's a little hybrid there. There's still the in-person convention, fun stuff.

551
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,000
But maybe when they need 30 minutes to change something up on the stage, you know what?

552
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:18,000
We're going to go to a god mode exhibition right now from one of our speed runners in Russia.

553
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Let's let's go to it, you know, and that could be a really cool way to maybe fill some time.

554
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:29,000
And then I know a lot of it becomes a more international event in the unites the world.

555
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:35,000
World of gamers. Yeah. So I think it would be great to maybe see like a little bit of a hybrid.

556
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
I don't I don't think it needs to like be mostly virtual.

557
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:45,000
I'm talking post covid and post pandemic, because if the flu of 1918 ended at one point, this one will, too.

558
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
It'll just take some time and some better leadership.

559
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
There's probably some games they wouldn't even be able to run.

560
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I would think they're supposed to play with the exhibitions, with Pump It Up and stuff like that.

561
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Pump It Up one's pretty cool. They might be able to do it if they were willing to broadcast from their arcade.

562
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Because when they do it on site, you know, the on site and I didn't realize how much went on until Bobby and Jason last year were telling me about it.

563
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:16,000
But they have, you know, not just what you see on Twitch, but there's a whole 24 hour arcade next door.

564
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:22,000
They have panels going on. It's basically a week long gaming convention, essentially.

565
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,000
So it would be if they could get cameras in the arcade. Tokyo attacked. I'm sure they have Pump It Up machines.

566
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
They might be able to do it on site still.

567
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:35,000
But I'm thinking more like the VR stuff is a great example, because that's kind of a pain in the ass to set up in person.

568
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:43,000
And the runners who might not be able to get here otherwise would be great to have just a little bit of that international flavor.

569
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,000
You know, maybe one or two a day tops, you know, just to spice it up a little.

570
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Do we, with all respect to the recaps and the clever things they're doing there, do we need that?

571
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Or could we maybe squeeze in a couple other speed runs from around the globe?

572
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,000
But these are questions GDQ is going to have to answer. I'm not in a position to do that.

573
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,000
And I'm not I'm not saying it was bad before. Certainly not.

574
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:16,000
The constant question. We're already a 10 out of 10 event. How do we make it 11? Right?

575
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,000
And maybe these are questions to make it 11.

576
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Questbuster in chat says the Half-Life Alyx run was awesome. Seeing the physical stuff the runner went through to do the tricks was a big part of that.

577
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:34,000
So, yeah, Bobby did a great job hosting and I tried to donate and get my donation read.

578
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:42,000
But I guess I snuck in an in-joke that didn't get through the screeners, which I so I'm not mad about it because the end of the day, it's about the charity.

579
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:47,000
It's about the speed runners. But when I send him my donation, I didn't put in my donation as Rob Roberts.

580
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I put in my donation as Mr. Smoosh, hoping that Bobby would read that.

581
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:56,000
And then the people that know would laugh because, oh, that we know who Mr. Smoosh is.

582
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
But oh, well, it didn't get through. I did. I just did my usual one.

583
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:07,000
You know, every year that I've donated for the last however many years, I've always introduced myself the same way on everyone.

584
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
And then when Dan does it, he's just like, here's the money.

585
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Here's the money. Like, take our money.

586
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:22,000
And the fact that Dan donates actually is saying something because he's pretty cheap.

587
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:30,000
All right. Let's move on, though. Congratulations to everybody involved with Games Done Quick, Bobby too.

588
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:37,000
And I don't know, was Jason involved? I didn't ask Jason if he had any involvement this year because he's been an on-site volunteer.

589
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:43,000
So I don't know if he did anything with a virtual event, but but but a hello and thank you to Jason for just being there anyway.

590
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
He does a lot of great work with our voiceovers, if nothing else.

591
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Let's move on. We have more gaming news to get to.

592
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Yes, this is exciting news that came out at the end of the Nintendo Indies little trailer that they did.

593
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I wouldn't say it's a trailer. Direct, I guess.

594
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:08,000
But apparently Untitled Goose Game is going to be getting a new free update on September 23rd.

595
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:13,000
And as part of that, they're going to have co-op play being added to the game.

596
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
So that's pretty awesome. Twice the goose power.

597
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
It'll be Untitled Geese?

598
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Yes, Untitled Geese Game.

599
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Which has finally brought one of the pre-show bumpers to light.

600
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
So if you listen on the podcast feed, you don't understand what I'm talking about.

601
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:37,000
But if you watch on Twitch, it always opens up with and it's a throwback to some would say Dragon Con TV, which yes,

602
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
but it's a real, real throwback to the show.

603
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:45,000
You can't do that on television where something is preempted so that the in fact, you know what?

604
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Hell with it. Hell with it. Even for you podcast folks, I'm going to play one right now.

605
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:57,000
So it has the little animation here for VOG and then it gets into this.

606
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Microsoft Fight Simulator will not be seen tonight so that we can bring you this special presentation.

607
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,000
OK, so ha ha. Get it? Because Flight Simulator is a big game this week.

608
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I worked very hard on photoshopping that logo, by the way.

609
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:18,000
So anyway, my point is, we actually had Untitled Geese Game as one of those before one of our episodes,

610
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,000
except it was a picture of Geese Howard from King of Fighting.

611
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
But still, we were close.

612
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Predictable.

613
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
That would have been fun. Yeah.

614
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:39,000
But yes, I'm very, very excited to see that update. That'd be pretty fun to see.

615
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:47,000
And hey, we can see some co-op speed runs now because I know Untitled Geese Game was one that's been in previous GDQs.

616
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Yeah, I can't wait to see what happens with that.

617
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
All right.

618
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:02,000
So let's talk about some of the other things that were shown at the Nintendo Direct, the Mini Direct, the Indie Direct.

619
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I mentioned earlier in the show, I actually saw, hey, already a success because I ended up buying Hades

620
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,000
because of that Direct, but they did announce that Hades is going to be coming to the Switch as well.

621
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
So that's pretty cool.

622
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
They also spent a little time talking about a game called Raji, an ancient epic,

623
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:26,000
which is a game set in ancient India and inspired by Hindu and Balinese mythology.

624
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I've been seeing our friend Shivam play it.

625
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Yeah.

626
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Talk about it. It looks really, really cool. I'm considering it.

627
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:39,000
It looks honestly like my gut reaction said it looks like Princess of Persia, like with the gameplay and everything.

628
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
I thought it looked pretty cool. So I'm definitely interested in picking that up.

629
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I've heard some very positive things about it and that looks really cool.

630
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:56,000
It looks like it's a very tactful way to represent some of those stories and so forth in game.

631
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I thought it was really cool.

632
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
They also showed Spiritfarer for the Switch.

633
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Now, Spiritfarer also came out on Xbox Game Pass and I think it's also on Steam and Epic Store.

634
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,000
So Spiritfarer came out a lot of places, but it was also in this presentation.

635
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
So there is that.

636
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:18,000
And then a game called A Short Hike, which you can play at your own pace.

637
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
You choose whatever path you want.

638
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
It has a very interesting kind of retro look to it.

639
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
It was kind of interesting looking.

640
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:33,000
A very common theme for a lot of these things they announced during that Indie Direct releases today.

641
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Like almost all of those things I mentioned.

642
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Raji released today. Hades didn't.

643
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
But then Spiritfarer did. A Short Hike did.

644
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
And there was a couple others too.

645
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
So they announced there was Torchlight 3.

646
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
They showed it's going to be coming to the Switch as well.

647
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
A game called Takishi and Hiroshi.

648
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I hope I said that right. Sorry.

649
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Hypnospace Outlaw.

650
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Card Shark, which looked kind of interesting.

651
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I don't know. That was kind of a weird one to me, but I was interested.

652
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Oh, here's the other later today.

653
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Manifold Garden, which looked kind of like a physics puzzle type of game.

654
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Kind of looked interesting.

655
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I think Shane told me he was playing that and he enjoyed that.

656
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
So there's that.

657
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Subnautica and Subnautica Below Zero were confirmed for a Switch launch in 2021.

658
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Garden Story. That game looked really cute coming in 2021 as well.

659
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Then there was Evergate and a game called Baron Breakfast.

660
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Yeah, that was cute.

661
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,000
I forgot to mention what I was talking about in title of the game.

662
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
They announced that there's going to be a physical release of that as well.

663
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
So that's something else you can look forward to if you haven't picked it up yet.

664
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Crystal Skies80 in our chat says,

665
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Spiritfarer is Game of the Year material for me.

666
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Well, that's quite the hype for that.

667
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
So I might have to check that out.

668
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
So many games. So little time.

669
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
But Spiritfarer is on Xbox Game Pass, thankfully.

670
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
So even though I might not get to it on Switch,

671
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
because, you know, I'll probably just get it on Game Pass,

672
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
I'll have to check it out. Sounds really cool.

673
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
So, yeah, I really, you know, the presentation overall,

674
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
I really enjoyed it. I thought for a quickie, you know,

675
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:10,000
and of course there's those goddamn people on Twitter

676
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,000
replying what Smash Brothers win.

677
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
New character Smash win. And it's like,

678
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
you fucking assholes, shut up.

679
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Like, how much plainer English can Nintendo say,

680
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:28,000
this is an indie event and we're not showcasing anything first party today?

681
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
They're just trolling, I think. They know better.

682
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Because they said it on the Twitter, they said it on the actual direct.

683
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
It's just people trolling, is what it is.

684
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Fine. Then the trolls need to shut up, too,

685
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:44,000
because they're muffling the noise of the people that are legitimately excited about some of the games.

686
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,000
And I thought Nintendo did a really good job on that presentation.

687
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Or I should say the indies did a really good job on that presentation.

688
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,000
So, all right. Well, let's move on.

689
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
We have more stories. Right, DarkSagra?

690
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
That we do. That we do.

691
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:06,000
So, and you actually made a little mention of this as far as style.

692
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
We were talking about that other game,

693
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,000
but Prince of Persia, the remake, there's a listing for it online

694
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:19,000
for Nintendo Switch and PS4, estimated to be released November of this year.

695
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:24,000
And if you are a Prince of Persia fan, I mean, honestly enough,

696
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
I think it would be absolutely delightful to have something like that on Switch.

697
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Although the main dude only looks like vaguely Persian.

698
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
So, just saying.

699
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Well, that is a classic, classic PC gaming to our early, late 80s computing.

700
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:46,000
I think the original Prince of Persia was like Apple IIe and Commodore 64 and TI-99A.

701
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Like, you know, all those computers that were out in the 80s.

702
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
That original was like a quintessence.

703
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Actually, no, I don't know if it goes back quite that far.

704
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
I don't know if it goes all the way back to Apple IIe,

705
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:01,000
but certainly like Macintosh and like that maybe later 80s era of home computing.

706
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Well, I have more.

707
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:07,000
So, at any rate, Ubisoft hasn't given any confirmation about it,

708
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,000
but we do have an Ubisoft Forward event happening pretty soon.

709
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:21,000
And the source came from a Nintendo distributor in Guatemala called Max.

710
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:28,000
So, take it as you will, but I would imagine they had to have something to make that go.

711
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
And we've been seeing the Prince of Persia rumors, you know,

712
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
going around about a new version coming out.

713
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,000
And one of the engineers from Ubisoft teasing something.

714
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
So, we'll see what happens.

715
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
YYR in chat is asking, not on Xbox?

716
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
If this remake is what we think it is,

717
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,000
they were already on Microsoft and Sony platforms some time ago.

718
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Yeah, I'm trying to pull up the original.

719
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Yeah, it's only listing Sony and Nintendo.

720
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Oh, I thought it was on Microsoft too. That's weird.

721
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:05,000
No, the image is, and for those, for our people in chat,

722
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:10,000
I'll be more than happy to give a link to the tweet to them.

723
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,000
But you might, someone posted it called Ken Ziro,

724
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:21,000
so K-E-N-X-Y-R-O on August 19th if our listeners want to look for the tweet.

725
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I'll link it in chat for our live people.

726
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
All right. Well, we'll see what comes to this.

727
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,000
I think looking forward to that Ubisoft forward event is a very good chance.

728
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
We'll hear a little more of this at that time.

729
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
In the meantime, in the meantime,

730
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,000
a few more stories before we get to the classic game of the week, starting with Loki.

731
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Yes, this is kind of ridiculous, but I'm not a huge brand loyal person,

732
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:52,000
but apparently a lot of folks are really into Supreme

733
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,000
and their product lines and clothing lines.

734
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Well, if you're really a huge fan of Supreme and a fan of Mortal Kombat,

735
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,000
you can get some horrible abomination that is a combination of those two

736
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:08,000
in the Supreme Mortal Kombat arcade cabinet from Arcade 1UP.

737
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,000
It has got Raiden ducked out in Supreme gear,

738
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
and it says Supreme on top instead of Mortal Kombat.

739
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
That's a bad idea.

740
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:28,000
It's also got Supreme, the stand at the bottom to raise it up as well.

741
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Yeah, I don't think I would want that.

742
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,000
YYR is asking a very valid question in chat right now.

743
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
What is Supreme?

744
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
It's brand and it's terrible and boring.

745
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I don't know.

746
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
It's like clothing.

747
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
It's really boring looking branding.

748
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I mean, it honestly is like your branding sucks.

749
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
See, when I gave this a once over, I thought that it was like,

750
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,000
oh, they're coming out with another cabinet,

751
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
but Arcade 1UP already has one.

752
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Okay, Supreme is an American skateboarding shop

753
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
and clothing brand established in New York City in 94.

754
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
The brand caters to skateboarding and hip hop cultures

755
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
as well as to youth culture in general.

756
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,000
The brand produces clothes and accessories and also manufactures skateboards.

757
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
So this might be where some of the disconnect is,

758
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,000
is that this is a brand catered towards a younger audience.

759
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
And let's be real, we're all in our late 30s and early 40s now here at OLR.

760
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
So these are clothes that probably don't even fit us.

761
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,000
So there's a little bit like, who is this really tart?

762
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
I mean, I get it.

763
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:46,000
But why would you want that on an arcade cabinet?

764
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
It just seems kind of silly.

765
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Like, I don't know.

766
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Like, I wouldn't want, you know.

767
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:58,000
I can't, I can't wait for the Calvin Klein, you know,

768
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Prince of Persia machine to come out.

769
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Yeah, like just like something like I wouldn't even like

770
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:09,000
if I'm going to get an arcade cabinet, you're going to you would want you would be.

771
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
I don't know, like it would be silly, like if they really wanted to go all out,

772
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:17,000
I think they should go, you know, double down on it and they should have like

773
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,000
reskin the actual characters in the game to be all wearing Supreme stuff.

774
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,000
That would be like kind of ridiculous enough for this cabinet.

775
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:30,000
But the fact that you're just putting like a new.

776
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,000
It's just it almost looks like a parody like on the outside.

777
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
I just don't see the point.

778
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Let me be that guy and ask the devil a good question.

779
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Isn't Mortal Kombat kind of that video game, though?

780
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Isn't Mortal Kombat kind of that parody video game, though?

781
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Like if any video game were to have all their characters,

782
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,000
like wouldn't Mortal Kombat be that game?

783
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,000
No, no, I don't think it would be.

784
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Crystal Skies 80 in chat says there is a large crossover between Mortal Kombat

785
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
and the hip hop community.

786
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
And I OK, I have no doubt market research.

787
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Yeah, but I think this could have very easily been a lot of different video games.

788
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I would say maybe Mortal Kombat and Warner Brothers

789
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
was probably the first to answer the phone.

790
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:22,000
So. All right. Anyhow, let's move on.

791
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Someone likes us.

792
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:29,000
All right. Let's move on and talk about control.

793
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:34,000
So last week on the program, we talked about how there was a report

794
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,000
that control would not be doing free upgrades, basically,

795
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
like if you own the PlayStation 4 version, too bad.

796
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
You had to buy it again if you wanted it on PlayStation 5.

797
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Same thing in the Microsoft climate as well.

798
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Well, this week, 505 Games kind of responded to this

799
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,000
and firmed their stance, basically, saying the following.

800
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
While it is challenging bringing any game to next gen platforms,

801
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,000
we quickly realized it was even more difficult to upgrade our current user base

802
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,000
to next gen with full parity across platforms with our year old game.

803
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Every avenue we pursued, there was some form of blocker

804
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,000
and those blockers meant that at least one group of players

805
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
ended up being left out of the upgrade for various reasons.

806
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
As of today, we can't offer an upgrade to everyone

807
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,000
and leaving any one group out feels unfair.

808
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Now, there's a couple of ways to take that comment

809
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,000
because I think a lot of people probably at first glance read that comment

810
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:33,000
and go, they're just blowing smoke up our ass. They don't want to do it.

811
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
But there's another part of me that reads this comment

812
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:41,000
and that goes, 505's throwing shade.

813
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,000
They're not making their target clear.

814
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Somebody isn't playing nice and they're not willing to out the bitch, basically,

815
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
because probably the ramifications.

816
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,000
I can't imagine, though, who that would be that's not playing nice

817
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:05,000
because if you think about it, there's plenty of other third party games

818
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,000
that are offering these free upgrades to the next gen thing

819
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
and they're offering it as well, but only for this ultimate edition thing

820
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
that you have to repurchase.

821
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I was going to say, there's probably some type of issue there

822
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
and that's what the articles I'm reading are theorizing too

823
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:26,000
is that it might have to do with you have the old version of the game,

824
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,000
that doesn't mean you get the ultimate version with everything on it for free.

825
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
So there might be a problem there.

826
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
They want people to maybe...

827
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
I'm not buying it, sorry.

828
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Because I could get it if it was like, you know,

829
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
well, we want to do all the stuff for the ultimate version,

830
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,000
but because of that, we can't make the regular version and that's why.

831
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,000
For example, say they were trying to push something with the DLC

832
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:54,000
that technology-wise, they couldn't do it on the current generation systems.

833
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:59,000
It was just so amazing that they could only do it on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.

834
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:04,000
And that's why they're like, OK, well, this version we can only sell on the systems.

835
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,000
But you're creating the assets, you're creating the game already

836
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,000
for the other system and the current gen system.

837
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
But for whatever reason, like if you even own the DLC,

838
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:22,000
like you have part A and part B and then you're selling part A and B together now as well.

839
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:27,000
But for some reason, this one can go and be upgraded, but the other one can't.

840
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
That doesn't make any sense.

841
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:33,000
It's the same game, essentially, except one of them has the DLC bundled with it

842
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,000
and the other one, you buy it separately.

843
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,000
I don't understand it.

844
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,000
To me, this sounds like a whole lot of the Assassin's Creed issue where they're like,

845
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:49,000
oh, yeah, you know, creating female characters is just too hard.

846
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,000
We would have to create all this extra clothing to fit on the female characters.

847
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
It's impossible. We can't do it.

848
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,000
I think it's more of it's expensive to do this.

849
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,000
And we want to sell you this copy because we need to

850
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
recoup the cost.

851
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:08,000
We need to offset the cost to develop this new version is what it is.

852
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,000
It's ridiculous.

853
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:16,000
It's absolutely ridiculous that it even pulled this.

854
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
All right. Well, it is what it is.

855
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,000
They did so consider that if you're going to buy control, because I,

856
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,000
I still need to play that game, but I'll tell you, I'm just going to sit and wait,

857
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
at least until I'm not going to buy it now.

858
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
If they're not going to give a free upgrade, I'll wait for the PlayStation

859
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,000
five and Xbox one versions or I'm sorry, Xbox Series X versions and do it then.

860
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Or even better, just wait for it to come on to games pass,

861
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:45,000
which is, you know, didn't they say it was going to come to Game Pass at some point?

862
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
I thought they announced it and then I don't know.

863
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I could be making it up. There's a lot of games.

864
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
There's a lot of games that I thought were coming to Game Pass,

865
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,000
like Final Fantasy 13, like a year ago that still haven't.

866
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:01,000
So I don't know. All right. Anyhow, let's move on.

867
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Let's let's go back to a simpler time there.

868
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
There wasn't really ultimate editions of games.

869
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
We might have got an HD edition years later.

870
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Wink, wink. Right.

871
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,000
But there was no we didn't get the same game on the very next platform.

872
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
All right. Anyway, it's the classic game of the week.

873
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I could have done that transition better, but oh, well, classic of the week.

874
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
So every week, dark soccer likes to step into the gaming vault

875
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,000
and find a game that she thinks, hey, you brats, check out this game,

876
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
because it's a class seek dark soccer.

877
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
What is the class line and go to an arcade?

878
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:37,000
I do want to warn the B roll tonight is only like two or three minutes.

879
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
So it's not going to cover the entire segment.

880
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:43,000
So if anyone needs a break and I should kill your camera, let me know.

881
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,000
All right. But it's the classic game of the week.

882
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,000
So dark soccer. What did you pick for us tonight?

883
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
I picked under defeat.

884
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:57,000
So it was a shooter game that was developed by Jireb,

885
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
released in Japanese arcades in 2005.

886
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,000
So it's an alternate reality during World War Two,

887
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:08,000
where you control German characters under the banner of the empire,

888
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
fighting the enemies called the Union,

889
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,000
the speak English and possess weapons that are patterned after real weapons.

890
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:19,000
So they're actually a patterned story after Allied and Axis powers.

891
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:24,000
So the there was a Dreamcast version released in 2006

892
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:30,000
and marketed as the last game for the system, although it actually was not.

893
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,000
But it wasn't really given great reviews, more like average,

894
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,000
because it's pretty, you know, pretty derivative.

895
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
You know, all shooters have been done,

896
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:47,000
but it did get a HD release for PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2002.

897
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,000
That was published by Rising Star Games.

898
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:56,000
It was updated to contain improved visuals, different control scheme options,

899
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,000
and new gameplay modes to adapt for the 16.9 display.

900
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:06,000
And of course, it was re-released in arcades cool enough as under defeat HD plus.

901
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,000
So with this game, you are a helicopter pilot

902
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:15,000
and you can rotate it kind of like Zero Gunner 2.

903
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:20,000
But most of the time, it's just very, you know, traditional

904
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,000
compared to a lot of the Toaplan games like Twin Cobra.

905
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:28,000
It does use 3D graphics and sort of a 2D setting with an angled perspective

906
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,000
to give things a little bit more depth.

907
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,000
But it's very, you know, it's very simple.

908
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Simple, you know, machine gun, bomb button, that's it.

909
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
And of course, you've got some different things.

910
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
It's a very unique visual style for Shmups, I think,

911
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,000
like the kind of like tilted sort of view it has.

912
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
But the game plays like any other.

913
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,000
So you have three attacks, you've got your machine gun,

914
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
your bombs, and your options.

915
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:59,000
So if you hold down the fire button or the X button,

916
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,000
you're going to get a continuous stream of bullets with the machine gun.

917
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
This is your primary weapon.

918
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,000
And you start with three bombs, but you can accumulate up to six.

919
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
You get a full screen blast.

920
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
We all know how that happens in these games.

921
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,000
And then you'll get different weapon assist options

922
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,000
that will give you extra firepower.

923
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,000
And it'll cycle through depending on where you are in the game

924
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
and what your stages are.

925
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Your helicopter can move in eight directions,

926
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:31,000
although your speed is fixed based on how the screen is scrolling.

927
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:36,000
You can have your left-right directions reversed in pilot style,

928
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:41,000
but it happens like in the game.

929
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,000
As far as the big thing that is,

930
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:49,000
I'd say its selling point with the original is your resolution mode.

931
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:53,000
So if you tap the R button on this, you'll get four different modes,

932
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:58,000
one that rotates the whole screen 90 degrees to the right.

933
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
You can also do it the other way.

934
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
If you were doing this at home, though,

935
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,000
you would have to have your TV on its side.

936
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
So having one of those rotating screens,

937
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,000
it really is kind of hard.

938
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:20,000
But at any rate, you've got a few different kind of weapons options.

939
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,000
You'll get the weapons option.

940
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:28,000
You have Vulcan machine gun, which is the same as your main gun.

941
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,000
It's a fast recharge, but weak in power.

942
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:37,000
You have a green cannon that's at eight moderately powerful salvos

943
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
that are fired one every second.

944
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
It can take out both small and medium.

945
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
It takes some helicopters with one shot.

946
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:47,000
It has a longer recharge and it has a shorter range than the rocket grenade.

947
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
And that's the last one, the rocket grenade,

948
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
which is a single powerful shot.

949
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
And it'll take out nearly every enemy in the game

950
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
and has blast radius damage.

951
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Really good for bosses, but it has a long recharge period.

952
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:05,000
You also do get some point modifiers by multiplying your support.

953
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Different multipliers get it go up.

954
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:12,000
You can get up to as large as 10,000 times modified.

955
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:18,000
As I was saying, though, it was released in Japanese arcades on October 27, 2005.

956
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,000
It had a soundtrack that was released in December.

957
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
The Dreamcast port came out March 23, 2006.

958
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:33,000
And it was announced basically five years after Sega said

959
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
that they were going to stop supporting the system.

960
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
The other games that came out after it, though,

961
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:44,000
were Triggerheart, Excellica, and Paris,

962
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,000
which might end up being the future games of the week.

963
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
We'll see.

964
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:53,000
But GRAM thought the game was a commercial success.

965
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,000
It sold through its first printing in one week.

966
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:02,000
It was basically their best-selling game since border down in 2003.

967
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,000
And they, of course, limited release

968
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:09,000
and had another limited edition with a pack-in CD.

969
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
It was different than the initial CD that came out.

970
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
And so since people were like,

971
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,000
we want more, we want more,

972
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:21,000
GREV did release the HD version of Under Defeat

973
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:25,000
for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in October 2011.

974
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,000
It was published by Rising Star Games.

975
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:35,000
And normally, a lot of the GREV games were Xbox 360 exclusives,

976
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:39,000
but they did go in with a PS3 port as well

977
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
in the digital storefronts that are.

978
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,000
So yeah, it's got all kinds of different modes in it.

979
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
I won't go into it for,

980
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,000
I know we have a lot of fans in there,

981
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:55,000
but it did, it was basically just considered to be,

982
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,000
you know, the perspectives on it were really novel,

983
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:04,000
but it was just considered to be fairly mediocre.

984
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
I mean, just like middle of the road for shooters,

985
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,000
like right above average for your shooter.

986
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,000
It got a C plus or maybe a B minus.

987
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,000
But it didn't have any inventive bullet patterns.

988
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,000
The scoring method was pretty, you know, cut and dried.

989
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:26,000
The controls were the same as most other ones out at the time.

990
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:31,000
So yeah, it was fairly average,

991
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
but it does have that novelty

992
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
of being a very late Dreamcast release.

993
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:41,000
So that's kind of fascinating how late this came out.

994
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Yeah, and G Rev, I mean themselves,

995
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:49,000
G Rev has had some amazing shooters.

996
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:53,000
I mean, they've also, you know, done some puzzle games

997
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
and things like that.

998
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,000
But I mean, they also assisted on Gradius 5

999
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:01,000
and they worked with Yuichi Hiroshi,

1000
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:06,000
who worked on Ikaruga on their game, Astrania.

1001
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,000
So they've, there are no newbies to this.

1002
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,000
They've done some fantastic games on here.

1003
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:17,000
The last arcade game, though, was Under the Heat HD.

1004
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:23,000
So I think that that also has, it should be important.

1005
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
One of the more recent ones for the record, though, by the way,

1006
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
was Darius first Chronicle Saviors,

1007
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
which has been absolutely hilarious

1008
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,000
to watch for their Sega themed add-ons.

1009
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:37,000
So, but yeah, going back to the original topic, though,

1010
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:42,000
it's absolutely, it's pretty, I'll give it that.

1011
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,000
It's a pretty game, but it's novel

1012
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,000
for its relation to Dreamcast release.

1013
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
All right.

1014
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Well, thank you for bringing that game to our attention,

1015
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Dark Sakura.

1016
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,000
It's a fun romp.

1017
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,000
It's a fun romp.

1018
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Under Defeat is a classic game of the week,

1019
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
if you want to look that up.

1020
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,000
All right.

1021
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Or the, you know, you probably are going to have a hard time

1022
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000
finding that, well, no, you're not,

1023
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
because Dreamcast games are pirated so easily.

1024
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Not that I would ever advocate piracy,

1025
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,000
but let's just be real.

1026
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
If you wanted to find it, it's pretty easy.

1027
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,000
But these remakes that they did for like PS3 and stuff

1028
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
are certainly worth your time as well,

1029
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,000
if you want to check it out.

1030
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
I mean, it's not the best shooter you'll ever play,

1031
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:29,000
but it's a romp.

1032
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,000
All right.

1033
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Anyway, thank you, Dark Sakura, as always.

1034
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Let's move on with our show.

1035
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,000
We got some rapid fire news, some quick news bullet points

1036
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
for tonight.

1037
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Loki, we'll start with you, I think.

1038
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Yeah.

1039
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,000
So there was the whole DC Fan Fest thing that was going on.

1040
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
There was a fan dome.

1041
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
So there was lots of announcements

1042
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,000
regarding DC properties, including a few games.

1043
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
So we, of course, got confirmation.

1044
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Lots of movie trailers, too.

1045
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
And that terrible Batman that's going to come out.

1046
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Can't we just have like a half a fun Batman movie?

1047
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Yeah, I don't know.

1048
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
We'll see.

1049
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
I have mixed feelings on the trailer,

1050
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
but I thought it would be worse.

1051
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
I'll put it that way.

1052
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
But anyway, sorry.

1053
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
But if you want to see our Discord,

1054
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
this is a good chance for me to shout out the Discord,

1055
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1056
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
I saw Tigerclaw and other people there dropping the trailers

1057
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
that were released from that event

1058
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,000
because there was the Zack Snyder kind of Justice League

1059
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,000
got a thing.

1060
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Wonder Woman has a new trailer where you can actually kind of,

1061
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
you can see Cheetah in it, finally.

1062
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,000
And then there's other, Suicide Squad,

1063
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,000
which I guess they're just pretending the last one didn't happen.

1064
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
I don't know what they're doing.

1065
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
There's another one with like 500 people.

1066
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:45,000
It's technically, they're not pretending it didn't happen.

1067
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
It has different people in it.

1068
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Oh, I thought they just were, okay.

1069
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:53,000
It's not just different people.

1070
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
It's 500 different people in that movie.

1071
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
It's so many.

1072
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
It looks great, though.

1073
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,000
It looks fantastic.

1074
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
So I am very excited about that.

1075
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Anyways, speaking of Suicide Squad, though,

1076
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
there is a game that's going to be coming out as well

1077
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
that looks like it has some of the similar team members in it as well.

1078
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:13,000
And that is Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League.

1079
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
It's going to be coming out in 2022.

1080
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:19,000
It looks fantastic, though.

1081
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,000
They showed off Harley Quinn, King Shark, Deadshot,

1082
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
and Captain Boomerang.

1083
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:29,000
But it's kind of teased right now,

1084
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
but it looks like that for some reason,

1085
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:35,000
some of the Justice League are going to be kind of villains in the game.

1086
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Like Superman has shown to be killing somebody in there.

1087
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
So that's, I thought it may have been like Bizarro.

1088
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Like we're going for injustice.

1089
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Sort of, yeah.

1090
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Sort of like that.

1091
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
So it's interesting.

1092
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,000
But yeah, I'm looking forward to that when that comes out.

1093
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
So they teased that a little bit.

1094
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
And then more, sooner than that, of course,

1095
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
we're going to be getting a brand new game

1096
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:00,000
from Warner Brothers Montreal, which is Gotham Knights.

1097
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,000
And that, of course, follows.

1098
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:09,000
I guess it's going to be similar to like the Batman Arkham Origins game.

1099
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:14,000
But it's following, of course, Batgirl, Nightwing, Red Hood, and Robin.

1100
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:18,000
And yeah, it looks interesting.

1101
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
That's going to be coming out in 2021.

1102
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
That looks pretty cool.

1103
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Yeah.

1104
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Yeah.

1105
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Yeah.

1106
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,000
And then this year, of course, we've got a brand new Call of Duty game coming out.

1107
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,000
So we have Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War.

1108
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:34,000
And they released a trailer for that as well.

1109
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Or I should say like a teaser that apparently was,

1110
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I think, coming from the end of an ARG that they did.

1111
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,000
And supposedly, they're going to be announcing more details

1112
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,000
later this week about the game.

1113
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,000
But they showed a little teaser kind of announcing the title of the game

1114
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
and everything.

1115
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,000
So it's interesting.

1116
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58,000
I like the Black Ops game, so I might have to check it out.

1117
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
But we'll see.

1118
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,000
All right.

1119
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,000
And as Jason said in the intro,

1120
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
you're the only one that knows about those games, really.

1121
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:08,000
So I haven't played them in a long time because it's just like they've

1122
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
been shoehorning.

1123
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
I guess the battle royale stuff is supposed to be pretty good.

1124
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
But I haven't played in a long time.

1125
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,000
And it's not I don't like jumping into it by myself.

1126
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,000
I like playing with friends, probably because I beat the crap out of them.

1127
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,000
But I just haven't played in a long time.

1128
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:27,000
So it's hard for me to jump back into like a battle royale game.

1129
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Like if I had them to play with, I probably would.

1130
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,000
But yeah, I don't know.

1131
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,000
All right.

1132
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
The single player campaigns, I just didn't pick up the last one.

1133
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
So I didn't play the single player campaign on that.

1134
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,000
But I do like the single player campaigns.

1135
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,000
All right.

1136
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Well, moving over to a series that has a lot,

1137
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:48,000
a lot of games across Sony and Nintendo,

1138
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
they don't release these.

1139
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Oh, no, they do sometimes on Microsoft.

1140
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,000
I feel like there's just not as many.

1141
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
But it's the Arcade Archives.

1142
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Hamster is the organization between Arcade Archives

1143
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,000
and they have revealed, they have their own streams they do

1144
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
called Arcade Archiver.

1145
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
There's so many of these.

1146
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
There's like 100 of them on Switch.

1147
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
But anyway, they are going to be doing some more games

1148
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:11,000
that will be coming to the Arcade Archives.

1149
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
This was a deal with Konami, it sounds like.

1150
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Contra is going to be coming out,

1151
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:21,000
as well as Gradius II and Super Cobra for Switch releases.

1152
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
And then one other outside Konami release

1153
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:26,000
that's still pretty exciting, Super Dodgeball,

1154
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
the Kunio-kun classic, the arcade version.

1155
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,000
That's going to be awesome because that was a good game.

1156
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,000
That will be coming out as well in the Arcade Archive collection.

1157
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
But we don't know when.

1158
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Just soon, trademark.

1159
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Happening right now, a Nintendo Switch eShop sale.

1160
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Yes, this is newsworthy because Nintendo games never go on sale.

1161
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:50,000
So, Luigi's Mansion 3 is now down from $60 to $42.

1162
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:54,000
So is Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games down $60 to $40.

1163
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Some other games on some deep cut sale on this Nintendo Switch.

1164
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Burnout Paradise Remastered, $35.

1165
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Overwatch, $20.

1166
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled, $24.

1167
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Diablo III Eternal Collection, $30.

1168
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,000
That's the one that includes Necromancer because it was on the Switch.

1169
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,000
There's a lot of indie games on sale as well through August 30th.

1170
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Somebody was telling me there's over like 500 games on the indie sale.

1171
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
But there's just so much to wade through on the Switch.

1172
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
It can be a little bit daunting.

1173
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000
A few of the highlights.

1174
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Exit the Gungeon, $7.

1175
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Ori and the Blind Forest, $14.

1176
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Hotline Miami, $8.74.

1177
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,000
That all again on Nintendo Switch.

1178
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,000
eShop sale, Dark Sakura.

1179
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Well, we have the, blah, I can't make words happen.

1180
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:48,000
The Astro City Mini has a release date for December 17th in Japan.

1181
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
And they've announced more titles for it.

1182
01:36:50,000 --> 01:37:00,000
So, originally we had Alien Syndrome, Alien Storm, Altered Beast, Columns 2, The Voyage Through Time, Dark Edge, Fantasy Zone, yay!

1183
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Golden Axe, Golden Axe, The Revenge of Death Adder, Puzzle in Action, Tant R, and Virtua Fighter.

1184
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Now added to the list is Bonanza Brothers, Columns, Cotton, yes, I love Cotton.

1185
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Cyber Police eSwat, Puyo Puyo.

1186
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,000
I mean, there's like a bunch of good games on here I love already.

1187
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Puzzle in Action, Ichidan R, Gain Ground, Shadow Dancer, another great game.

1188
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Shinobi, Wonder Boy, Wonder Boy in Monsterland, and Wonder Boy 3, Monster Lair.

1189
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:34,000
So, I have some excitement going on in my heart for this one.

1190
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:40,000
And the system is going to be roughly 40 bucks.

1191
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,000
I think it's more than that.

1192
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,000
The controller, sorry, is going to be 40 bucks.

1193
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Yeah, I was going to say it's like 120 or something.

1194
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Yeah, the system is going to be actually more like 130, but yeah.

1195
01:37:52,000 --> 01:38:01,000
And then they've got the little stand that goes with it that makes it look like a full Sega Astro City instead of just kind of like a bar top, which there was never a bar top Astro City.

1196
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,000
But, yeah, kind of.

1197
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
And it becomes a little store as well, so it's pretty cool.

1198
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,000
This is absolutely a do want situation.

1199
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:23,000
And anyway, the other Harmonix game that was announced, Fusor, has 12 more songs that were added to the roster.

1200
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,000
So it's going to launch with more than 100 songs.

1201
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:36,000
New games announced are Aja's Take On Me, Ace of Base The Sign, Amy Winehouse Rehab, Basement Jax, Where's Your Head At? I love Basement Jax.

1202
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Becky G with Natty Natasha's Tin Pajama? I don't know the song.

1203
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Benny Benassi presents The Biz Satisfaction, Childish Gambino, Summertime Magic.

1204
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
I'll just list the rest of them.

1205
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,000
GDFR, The Killer's The Man.

1206
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Jurgle Steve and Pay, the new Manuah song.

1207
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Yeah, I remember the song.

1208
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Which for some fucking reason has been stuck in my head for a solid two weeks and I've been making up lyrics to it to the cat.

1209
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:13,000
We have Fortnangel, PVD Remix 09 and Sean Paul's Temperature.

1210
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:20,000
It's due to be out on PS4, Xbox One, Switch and PC via Steam later on.

1211
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Aziz Fall.

1212
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,000
That's a heck of a list.

1213
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,000
All right.

1214
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Yeah, it is.

1215
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Well, let's travel around the world and check out some games that are going to be coming out a little sooner than this fall.

1216
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Yeah.

1217
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:35,000
So this week we've got Cinders coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1218
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:45,000
We have, I'm going to try not to butcher this, Kendagawa Jet Girls on PC and PlayStation 4.

1219
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition coming out on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, iOS and Android.

1220
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:59,000
The Legend of Heroes, Hajimari no Kiseki.

1221
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
That's on PlayStation 4.

1222
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Moon Remix RPG Adventure on Nintendo Switch.

1223
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Surgeon Simulator 2 on PC and Tell Me Why Chapter 1.

1224
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:24,000
And then, of course, we also have on towards the end of the week here, Captain Tsubasa Rise of the New Champions on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

1225
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Immortal Realms Vampire Wars on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1226
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Jump Force Deluxe Edition on Nintendo Switch.

1227
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Madden NFL 21 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1228
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Project Cars 3 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1229
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Wasteland 3 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1230
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:56,000
And last but not least, Windbound on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and some console called Stadia.

1231
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Why are they doing a Captain Tsubasa game 10 years after the last one?

1232
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Why not?

1233
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
I mean, the manga has been out since 1981.

1234
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
It's a soccer game.

1235
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Yeah, but sometimes they revive old stuff for, you know, just how they do it.

1236
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
I was just a little surprised. That's all.

1237
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:18,000
All right, let's travel to Japan and check out some releases over there.

1238
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,000
And I got to say, we've had a couple slow weeks in Japan.

1239
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
That's not the case this week.

1240
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,000
We're getting a backlog kind of unloaded on us this week.

1241
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:30,000
So Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles is released on the Switch this week in Japan.

1242
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
That's going to be a big one because I know that's here.

1243
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
It'll be a big deal, too.

1244
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:40,000
The Captain Tsubasa also released Rise of New Champions, also releasing in Japan this week on the 27th.

1245
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:45,000
A game called Giraffe and Annika is coming out this week on the Switch.

1246
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:49,000
It's kind of like cartoony, kind of looks like one of those level five games at first glance,

1247
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:53,000
but I don't think it's like comic book style cut scenes and things like that.

1248
01:41:53,000 --> 01:42:00,000
And then also in Japan, we have Shinobi Koi Utsutsu for Nintendo Switch.

1249
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,000
I don't think that is to be confused with the popular Sega series of games.

1250
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:08,000
It looks like it's based off Ninja School.

1251
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:13,000
That's what it is. It's kind of one of those mangas about schools, but it's Ninja School.

1252
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Also a game called Konosuba, God's blessing on this wonderful world, Labyrinth of Hope and the Gathering of Adventurers Plus.

1253
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:25,000
That is the fucking title of this game.

1254
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Anyway, it looks like it's kind of like a redo of an earlier game.

1255
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:33,000
That's why they call it Plus, but it has like a new dungeon, new monsters.

1256
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:38,000
It's kind of like a dungeon crawler, but like first person a little bit.

1257
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Let's see, Forager, also on the Switch this week.

1258
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:49,000
No Straight Roads, Urugashi no Naku Koro Nihu comes out this week as well.

1259
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
So very busy. That's just the Switch.

1260
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:56,000
If I go to the PlayStation 4, we're going to see a lot of those similar titles.

1261
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Captain Tsubasa, The Legend of Heroes, Hajimari no Kisuke is out as well.

1262
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Kiss Trilogy comes out in a regular and premium edition this week.

1263
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,000
And Giraffe and Annika also on PlayStation 4.

1264
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:10,000
MotoGP20 is there as well this week.

1265
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:17,000
And Terminator Resistance and The Legend of Heroes, Hajimari no Kisuke and that same title.

1266
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
I'll say it one more time on the PlayStation 4.

1267
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Konosuba, God's blessing on this wonderful world, Labyrinth of Hope and the Gathering of Adventurers Plus.

1268
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:31,000
That was the alternate name for this podcast actually at one point.

1269
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:35,000
I just like that Giraffe and Annika has a musical mayhem edition.

1270
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
That sounds like fun.

1271
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,000
I just would play a game called Musical Mayhem.

1272
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
What was that game?

1273
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Eternal Sonata, remember that RPG they made out of music?

1274
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Where the hell did that game go? That was a cool game.

1275
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Alright, anyway.

1276
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,000
I think I have it.

1277
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:54,000
It deserves a redo, I don't know.

1278
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Alright, anyway.

1279
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Let's move on.

1280
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:01,000
By the way, just a quick programming note for those of you that have followed OLR for a long time.

1281
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:04,000
You might be expecting us to do the mailbag right here because we usually do.

1282
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
No, after I do mine.

1283
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,000
No, I know.

1284
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:10,000
We're going to move the mailbag to the end of the show.

1285
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Programming note.

1286
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:17,000
But I haven't even done my part for us to announce mailbag which comes after IT European releases.

1287
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Yes, that is very true.

1288
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
There is that as well.

1289
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Got it.

1290
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Slow down.

1291
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
No, I'm fast.

1292
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Girl, catch your wig.

1293
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Anyway.

1294
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:37,000
On the 24th in the UK, we have Street Power Football which is real football and not American football.

1295
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:44,000
We have Descenders on August 24th and also No Straight Roads.

1296
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:48,000
On the 26th, Gear Club Unlimited 2 Tracks edition.

1297
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Gay Roads only.

1298
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:56,000
And then coming out on the 27th is a horde of things.

1299
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:14,000
The Sojourn, Project Cars 3, Jump Force Deluxe Edition, Madden NFL 21, Dead Cells Prisoner's Edition, Captain Tsubasa Rise of New Champions, Wasteland 3, Immortal Realms Vampire Wars, Nexomon Extinction.

1300
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
And that is it.

1301
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Not yet for the full month but those will come next week.

1302
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Alright.

1303
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Thing I said about the mailbag, insert it here.

1304
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,000
We'll get to that.

1305
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
We're merging it with the listener roundtable.

1306
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
So it makes more sense to be there.

1307
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Alright, moving on.

1308
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Let's get to some more stories, Loki.

1309
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Alright.

1310
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:42,000
So we should have seen this coming even though they promised that this wouldn't happen but can you really trust Facebook?

1311
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,000
You can't.

1312
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Well, I can't believe I'm going to defend Facebook.

1313
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,000
But Facebook did not say this.

1314
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
This would never happen.

1315
01:45:53,000 --> 01:46:00,000
The person who started Oculus, who hasn't been with Oculus for a long time, had that to say.

1316
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,000
We knew this was going to happen eventually.

1317
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Facebook still sucks, don't get me wrong.

1318
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:11,000
But I feel like we should hate them for the right reasons and not make up new ones.

1319
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Yes.

1320
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:18,000
So apparently, starting in October, you're going to have to log into...

1321
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:26,000
In order to be able to use your Oculus to, I guess, access your Oculus account, you're going to need to log in with a Facebook account.

1322
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:34,000
And apparently, if you are a current user of the Oculus and already have an Oculus account,

1323
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:40,000
you will need to link it with a Facebook account within the next two years to maintain the full functionality of your system.

1324
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:44,000
So after January 1st, 2023 is when that's going to go into effect.

1325
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,000
I'm not surprised.

1326
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:56,000
I don't know why we need to do it, but I'm sure that tracking your activities is probably part of it.

1327
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Because Facebook is going to want to show elements of your newsfeed in VR and it is only a matter of time before...

1328
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:09,000
And this whole COVID situation is only accelerating this.

1329
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:12,000
What did I say when Facebook bought Oculus in the first place?

1330
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:18,000
They want to put more live events and event-type experiences, not just games, but the others.

1331
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Remember, there's other stuff that Oculus can do, concerts and things like that.

1332
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Facebook wants to push, push, push that on your Oculus.

1333
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:32,000
And the only way they're going to know the type of stuff you like is for them to track all of the shit you do on Facebook.

1334
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
That's what it is.

1335
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
I can't wait to get some really weird ads.

1336
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Fuck Facebook.

1337
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Let me make that very clear.

1338
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Fuck Facebook.

1339
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,000
But that's what they're doing.

1340
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Since I already own an Oculus Rift, it's no big deal.

1341
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:54,000
I already have a Facebook account and I already get tons of ads as it is.

1342
01:47:54,000 --> 01:48:03,000
I don't really care, but maybe if you haven't purchased a VR device, you might think twice about what you purchased.

1343
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:09,000
If it's a big deal to you, I mean, certainly that's a factor, but I don't know.

1344
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
It's kind of too late for me.

1345
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
So what am I going to do?

1346
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Bobby does want to say this.

1347
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,000
To be fair, Palmer's words were exactly,

1348
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:23,000
you will never need a Facebook account to use your Oculus Rift.

1349
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Well, gotcha, gal. They don't make Oculus Rift anymore.

1350
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,000
It's Rift S and the Quest.

1351
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Well, true.

1352
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
He lied.

1353
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Technically true.

1354
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:41,000
But do you need to log into your Oculus account to be able to use stuff through Steam?

1355
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:45,000
I can't remember if they've changed that now to where you have to log into that.

1356
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:51,000
I know that, because I tend to purchase a lot of my stuff not through the Oculus Rift, just through Steam VR,

1357
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:54,000
because I can get better discounts on that stuff.

1358
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:58,000
So I'm curious if that is going to prevent me from doing that stuff.

1359
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:01,000
I would think not, but you never know.

1360
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Bobby says no, but you have to have the Oculus account to do setup on your device.

1361
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Well, there you go.

1362
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Well, I mean, I can think of no better advertisement for the HTC Vive than what Oculus just did this week, as far as I'm concerned.

1363
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,000
I have not taken the leap into VR on the PC yet.

1364
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:26,000
I haven't really just found that thing.

1365
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:30,000
I have that baby's first VR, the PlayStation VR.

1366
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
It works great.

1367
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:37,000
It does what I need to do and plays enough of the games I want to play, so I haven't felt the need to go up to PC yet.

1368
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:44,000
But if that were to happen in the next few years, say right around the time this is going to end up mandatory next year anyway,

1369
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:49,000
I think this just sold me an HTC Vive.

1370
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
For sure, yeah.

1371
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Not me.

1372
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,000
If you're not going to any of the platforms.

1373
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
I'm not getting any of them.

1374
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Well, you know.

1375
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
I get to save that money.

1376
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:05,000
But I don't know if I'm going to be getting it anytime soon.

1377
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,000
I mean, honestly, I don't VR enough.

1378
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,000
I actually think we have one more.

1379
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Yeah.

1380
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,000
All right.

1381
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Anyway, let's move on.

1382
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Let's talk about Twitch as a platform again.

1383
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,000
But this one's a little better than the...

1384
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,000
And again, the last story we talked about, it wasn't even Twitch's fault.

1385
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Twitch's was just the vehicle for some shady practice.

1386
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
But anyway, this is something Twitch is doing.

1387
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,000
It's kind of making some tweaks to Twitch drops.

1388
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:38,000
So, you know, Twitch drops are when you watch a feed and you get drops.

1389
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Like, for example, a big, big example of this was when Riot Games started using the drops for Valorant, right?

1390
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:49,000
So if you watched other people play it, you might get the key for yourself.

1391
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Yeah, it didn't go...

1392
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Like, people abused the shit out of that system, right?

1393
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Running like a 24 hour, just watch me and get the drops thing.

1394
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,000
So guess what?

1395
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Twitch is revisiting the drop system a little bit.

1396
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:05,000
I got to say, this is a smart response in my opinion.

1397
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Developers, not Twitch, but developers are now being given more control over how rewards are handed out.

1398
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:22,000
So streamers may have to complete certain in-game events like killing a boss, finding an item, essentially achievement.

1399
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Achievement unlocked for you and you and you and you.

1400
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,000
That's what Twitch drops might be turning into a little bit.

1401
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:32,000
You get an achievement and you get an achievement.

1402
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Look under your chair. You get an achievement. We all get achievements.

1403
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Alright, anyway.

1404
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Yay!

1405
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:42,000
So that is something they're looking to build that in.

1406
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:48,000
So the unlock embeds are going to be linked to Twitch's Enhanced Experiences API.

1407
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:56,000
So rewards could be when somebody completes a level or let's say you're the last person standing in something like Fall Guys or another Battle Royale game.

1408
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
That would be a possibility.

1409
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:01,000
So developers can kind of do this as they see fit.

1410
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:10,000
And I think that's a great idea because this means if you're going to run a 24-7 stream, you're going to have to actively be playing the game in order to get the drops.

1411
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:14,000
And you're going to have to be really aware of that.

1412
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
And I think that's pretty cool.

1413
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:25,000
So anyway, looking forward to seeing how developers embed that in their games later on as they choose to do so.

1414
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Dark Tetsuya says Rogue Company does the Twitch drops thing too. Tell me more. Is that Rogue Legacy 2 or what are they doing?

1415
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:41,000
I'd be curious to know how that is being added.

1416
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:46,000
And the chat room is noticing right now that Stella has joined Loki on camera there.

1417
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Chilling out on Loki's shoulder there.

1418
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Yeah, we love to see Stella on air. It's lovely.

1419
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Alright.

1420
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Min just kind of pissed off that I locked her out.

1421
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:00,000
I think Alan either is leaving or just got back and Mr. Smoosh is going wild. Oh, he's on his way out.

1422
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,000
So Mr. Smoosh is like, wait, before you go, give me more food.

1423
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Smooshy.

1424
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Alright, let's move on.

1425
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Dark Stalker, I think you said you had to go a little early tonight.

1426
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,000
I do.

1427
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:15,000
I want to squeeze in one more story before you do so, okay?

1428
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,000
I guess.

1429
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:21,000
So at any rate, I really should be playing this.

1430
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
One of my friends have been going nuts about it.

1431
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:31,000
But Fall Guys, they have started a Twitter branding like bidding war.

1432
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Sorry for charity.

1433
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
And I love the caption on this one.

1434
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:40,000
It's got this little pink dude wearing a shirt that says, ask me about my butthole.

1435
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Oh, did that.

1436
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
It's a bidet company. Did they win?

1437
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,000
I don't know.

1438
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
It's just the picture that they use. I think it's great.

1439
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Yeah, it's great.

1440
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Anyway, they're doing a two week Battle of the Brands event.

1441
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:03,000
And the brand that donates the most to the charity special effect would get Italian.

1442
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Right now their bidding has gone over 130,000.

1443
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,000
Wow.

1444
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Yeah, there are all kinds of just...

1445
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Hilarity is ensuing, I'll just let you know.

1446
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:28,000
But it'll be good to have, you know, have that marketing and branding go into something good.

1447
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
You know, have that go in.

1448
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:38,000
So right now, one of the highest bidders at the time was the Warframe developers did 20,000.

1449
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:43,000
And then bisect hosting went to 38,880.

1450
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:49,000
And then the new one came up with Sidemen.

1451
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,000
They are, they're going through it.

1452
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
They bumped it up to 40,000.

1453
01:54:54,000 --> 01:55:00,000
And then Tushy Bidet, $40,000 and one cent.

1454
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,000
And that's where ask me about my butthole came from.

1455
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Yep.

1456
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:12,000
And then after that, though, after more fun bidding, G2 Esports went up to $130,003.

1457
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Wow.

1458
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:16,000
That's on the second day.

1459
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,000
So we're about to see this blow up.

1460
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Well, and there's been interesting alliances made too.

1461
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Like Ninja teamed up with somebody else and they made like a COVID or something.

1462
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
So it's pretty cool.

1463
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,000
I hope the bidet company wins.

1464
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,000
I really do.

1465
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,000
But I think it's great that it's for charity.

1466
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:41,000
And especially when you have a game and a developer like the folks behind Fall Guys, like this is, you know, they're all the rage right now.

1467
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
They're all, they're one of the top games on Twitch.

1468
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:47,000
They have this peak popularity going on right now and they're riding that wave.

1469
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:50,000
And like everybody wants to be a part of it because it is so popular.

1470
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:59,000
The fact that they're riding that wave for charity when Burger King probably called them already offering them $5 to put the skin in the game.

1471
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:05,000
I think it's, I think it's pretty cool that they're using this as a way to generate money for charity.

1472
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
So, you know, kudos to them.

1473
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
And I, you know, Fall Guys is Dark Soccer.

1474
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,000
You absolutely should check it out.

1475
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:14,000
I think one of the great things about it is it's a game you can really play in small bites.

1476
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Because, yes, it's a battle royale kind of game, but it's not a shooty shooty bang bang.

1477
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,000
It's a platformer.

1478
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
So it's it plays a lot differently.

1479
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:27,000
And it's something where it's like you can play it and you might be out of it in 30 seconds and like, oh, well, I guess that's enough for today.

1480
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Or, you know, God damn it, I'm going to play until I get the fucking crown.

1481
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:34,000
And then you play for eight days straight like that one streamer did.

1482
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Oh, hell no.

1483
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:40,000
I don't think it was really like it wasn't like twenty four seven.

1484
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:46,000
But I remember there was some clip floating around to some guy who finally won a match after like eight days.

1485
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:50,000
And the whole Internet was so excited.

1486
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Yeah. And they were they were giving him shade too on the actual official Twitter.

1487
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:57,000
I think it was giving him shade on it as well. So that's kind of funny.

1488
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Yeah. OK. So I went ahead and put Fall Guys in my my wish list on Steam.

1489
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:07,000
So, yay. Oh, I'm putting it in there now.

1490
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:14,000
So act. Oh, I think I think this is brilliant. Act Def says it's like the Mario Party mini games, but with more people.

1491
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:18,000
That's a damn good way of putting it. That is a damn good way of putting it.

1492
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Marissa Meisel in chat. Hello, my dear, says I love a fall, fall, fall, gaze, fall, guys.

1493
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:35,000
And usually, well, that's when me and Delvin get on stream and play fall guys together and start screaming.

1494
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:42,000
That's fall gaze. I love fall guys. And usually games like that stress me out too much.

1495
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:48,000
This is just silly fun in my wish list. Why are you letting me put you on my wish list?

1496
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:52,000
I'm Dijerama says if you do have it for me.

1497
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Well, if you have played PlayStation four and you have PlayStation Plus, it's free on PS Plus right now.

1498
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:03,000
So you wouldn't even have to write the way you just did. That was iconic.

1499
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:09,000
You sat up in your seat, flicked your hair and went, bitch. Yeah.

1500
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:14,000
But I was like right now. So this isn't like a permanent thing. It's going to go back to pay.

1501
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Yeah. It's only for this month. So you don't have a lot of time left. Yeah.

1502
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:25,000
And I really need to get back into the steamy stuff so that I can stream it a little bit better.

1503
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Yeah. So. All right. Well, before we say goodbye, goodbye to you, Dark Sakura.

1504
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Do you have any final thoughts or anything for our audience tonight?

1505
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:41,000
I want big suggestions. All right. I want to see some big suggestions.

1506
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:48,000
What kind of wig do you think I should get next? Because I'm going to be weeding out some wigs.

1507
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:52,000
And if some of y'all want Jamie wigs, I will clean those bitches and send them to you.

1508
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:57,000
I want to see and hear me out, please. I want to see a wig from the wig party,

1509
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:05,000
meaning like eighteen hundreds sign in, you know, or I guess seventeen hundreds sign in the Declaration of Independence Realness.

1510
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Do I look like I have time to powder a wig?

1511
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:14,000
It is. It is. I will say Annie Lennox pulled that type of look off beautifully in one of her music videos.

1512
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:19,000
So she did the one for Y, right? Yeah. I think it was Y or maybe walking on broken glass.

1513
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Walking on broken glass was the one. Yeah. So I love Annie Lennox.

1514
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:30,000
She is a goddess and a diva. Any decent person does.

1515
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:35,000
I don't know how else to put it. Like, there's just certain people where it's like, who?

1516
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Who on earth would hate this person? And Annie Lennox is one of them. Of course, I know.

1517
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:44,000
I'm just inviting somebody in chat to say I'm not a fan. Well, you can keep your wrong opinion.

1518
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Yeah. Exactly. If you if you're not an Annie Lennox fan, how about you just shut up?

1519
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Just how about you just shut up? Look, every gamer has a voice, but not you.

1520
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Actually, I do want to bring up one more little thing, and I don't really know if y'all talked about it last week, but it just was a cute thing.

1521
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Sure. Is that Taiwanese IKEA catalog done all in Animal Crossing?

1522
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:15,000
I don't think we ended up addressing that. No, it is cute as hell.

1523
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:20,000
And I really want it. But I just think that it's something that made me just happy to see.

1524
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:32,000
And I'll post the link to it in the chat room. But but y'all look up the Taiwanese IKEA Animal Crossing book.

1525
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:38,000
It's super adorable. They did a really great job trying to make things match up.

1526
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:44,000
They even have captions and everything. The scroll bar on Twitch is perfection right now.

1527
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:48,000
It just scrolled that story by on the bottom as you're talking about it. Perfect.

1528
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Well, yeah, I that thing is all this thing is like all automated, too.

1529
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:58,000
So it's pretty, pretty stunning. Awesome. That's pretty sweet.

1530
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:02,000
So, yeah, there you go. It's it's it's adorable. Look at the adorable things.

1531
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:07,000
And, you know, hey, if any of y'all is still playing Animal Crossing, hit me up for my friend code.

1532
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:11,000
If you don't have it, I think I'm ready. When are we doing our Animal Crossing show?

1533
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
When are we doing our Animal Crossing lounge radio?

1534
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:22,000
I need to I need to figure out my streaming set up because it I think it's actually more just because my Mac is an older Mac.

1535
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:27,000
I'll stream on and you just join me on Discord like you do now. And we'll I'll go to your town or something.

1536
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:30,000
You can show that off. All right. We'll do it. We'll do it.

1537
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Animal Crossing lounge radio coming soon to Vogue on a on a completely irregular schedule,

1538
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:39,000
on a completely when we feel like it schedule because that's the only way it's going to fly.

1539
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:43,000
So so I will I will wish you all well.

1540
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Wear your mask. Social distance. Be safe.

1541
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Be careful. Be healthy. And I hope to see you all next week.

1542
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:57,000
All right. We'll see you next time. Dark soccer. Have a great night. Later, taters.

1543
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Bye bye. And don't forget to wash your hands. Very good. Very good.

1544
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Do the hand washing. Yeah. All right. All right.

1545
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:09,000
So dark soccer is out. Let me fix the cameras there. All right.

1546
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Let's move on. We have just a few more stories for you guys that we need to get to the listener roundtable.

1547
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:17,000
So Loki with a follow up to some big stuff from last week.

1548
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:23,000
Yeah. Let's talk about Epic and Apple. So there's still a lot of drama there, unfortunately.

1549
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:28,000
So, of course, you may remember last week, Fortnite was taken up.

1550
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Oh, someone wants to get down. Oh, Stella was like, you're talking about this bullshit.

1551
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:39,000
I'm out. It's like, nope.

1552
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Draw the line here. OK. If if blessed, sure.

1553
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Me, wherever. Sure. Me, the cat. Maybe we're still with us. That would have been sure.

1554
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Me's opportunity to just poo on the floor. Thank goodness she doesn't do that.

1555
02:02:54,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Anyways. So apparently. So you may remember that, you know, Fortnite was taken off of the app,

1556
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:06,000
the iOS store and the Android store. I'm sorry, Google Play Store.

1557
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:12,000
And of course, there's a lawsuit against Apple about the whole thing as well.

1558
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:16,000
So kind of moving forward with that,

1559
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:23,000
shortly after that, Epic's developer tools have been removed as well for Fortnite.

1560
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:30,000
And that's also restricted access to make updates as well for Unreal Engine.

1561
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:39,000
And so that's caused a lot of problems. So, of course, Epic has asked the court to prevent Apple from doing that.

1562
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:48,000
And they filed an injunction for that. But not sure where that so far that hasn't been revoked yet.

1563
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:56,000
So we'll have to see if they restore their access to that. But right now, they haven't done anything.

1564
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:01,000
It's almost as if you play with fire and you might get burned. Exactly.

1565
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:08,000
So then, of course, now, because they filed this whole lawsuit, all this stuff is now public information.

1566
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:13,000
And so we get to see some of the details about how we got to this point in the first place.

1567
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:24,000
So it appears that originally there was Tim Sweeney had reached out to Apple execs to try to let his company bypass their payment system.

1568
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:31,000
And they said no. And you put that way nicer than he did.

1569
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:38,000
He basically said, well, I'm going to do it anyways. And they're like, bye. I'm going to be very blunt.

1570
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Those emails from Tim Sweeney look like they were written by whatever press relations department North Korea uses when talking about their weapons arsenal.

1571
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:55,000
That is how that letter basically read is that, you know, you will rise to the mighty.

1572
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:58,000
OK, maybe it wasn't that bad, but that's how it was like, like reading to me.

1573
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:04,000
It was like, my God, he's just making all these demands for what?

1574
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:10,000
And what are you going to give? You know, like it just it just seems so shady.

1575
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:23,000
It is so it's interesting, though, that he would want somebody to bypass their payment system to offer to basically bypass their whole marketplace, but yet be available on on their devices.

1576
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:28,000
But the same time, like I can't put a game on his store and like bypass their payment system.

1577
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:34,000
I can't pay him less money because I just feel like I want to do that. I just I don't know.

1578
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:47,000
I have a hard time. You know, seeing the logic here where they're the victim, but to still play the victim, though, of course, they have, you know.

1579
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:54,000
They they're still doing their campaign, their social campaign to try to get people to, you know, put pressure on Apple and stuff.

1580
02:05:54,000 --> 02:06:04,000
And I see this this they have a nice little a photo here of a hat that's parroting Apple as well.

1581
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:09,000
I don't know. Basically, they're saying it's this whole.

1582
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Looks like they're doing a competition right now for this free fortnight cup, which is apparently was today.

1583
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:20,000
It's just a PR thing, whatever. Yeah.

1584
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:24,000
So. I don't know. I think it's dumb.

1585
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:29,000
And plus, I need to be able to say say this because I love tooting my own horn when I'm right.

1586
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:33,000
I mean, I don't like being right all the time, but I can't help it. No, I get a lot of things wrong, too.

1587
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:38,000
But last week I was right because I said, what is the whole motivation for this?

1588
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:42,000
Why is Epic doing this? What is the this isn't about? I said this isn't about Fortnite.

1589
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:46,000
This is about Epic winning the Epic Game Store on iOS.

1590
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:55,000
And sure enough, what was in those court filings? A reference to Epic and wanting to do their own store on iOS.

1591
02:06:55,000 --> 02:07:02,000
And that thing is locked and loaded and ready to go. And if Epic prevails in this whole thing, that is exactly what they're going to want to launch.

1592
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:05,000
And I just, you know, and I just defer to what I said last week.

1593
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Epic needs to fix their fucking problems on PC first before they jump into iOS.

1594
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:14,000
And you know what? You might not be an Apple fan and that's fine.

1595
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:21,000
But where this goes, what about Nintendo? What about Sony? What about Microsoft?

1596
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Because if Epic, like shoehorn, literally shoehorns their way on iOS in this regard, it's going to happen on game consoles as well.

1597
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,000
You better believe it.

1598
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Exactly. Yeah, because you can't you can't make the argument that, well, it's these are closed platforms and anybody can be allowed to do it.

1599
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:42,000
But I think that these are private companies. I don't understand why you should.

1600
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Sure, I would love to see competition.

1601
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:51,000
They signed an agreement they don't like, and now they're trying to say that it's unfair and all this other stuff.

1602
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Like, I understand if they have issue with Apple's 30% cut or whatever and they want to negotiate a better deal.

1603
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:01,000
But that's the key term there is negotiate.

1604
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:13,000
And everything I said last week about the thing, whether you like it or not, with Apple's platform, about how they quality review all the apps, even the free ones that make no money to Apple or the developer.

1605
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:20,000
They review those two, whether you like it or not, like that stuff doesn't pay for itself.

1606
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:25,000
So they're going to take a cut somewhere. And Epic badly wants to undercut them.

1607
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:29,000
I'm telling you, I am I am I am 100 percent right on this.

1608
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Epic wants to undercut them and they're going to leverage their Unreal Engine to do it.

1609
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:37,000
I'm this is I see the end of this coming.

1610
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:46,000
So like if you're going to root against Apple because you think Apple has too much control or Apple calls all the shots, guess wake up.

1611
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Epic is trying to position themselves to do the same thing.

1612
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:58,000
If Epic really wants that, though, you know what they should do. Make their own fucking phone.

1613
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Well, and on top of that, though, like I get that with on the Apple side of the house, but then they did the same thing on the Google Play Store.

1614
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:13,000
And if you look there, that's kind of a different scenario because they could, in a sense, put out their own storefront.

1615
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Sure, you'd have to sideload it, but you can do that.

1616
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:22,000
You could put out your own storefront and have your own purchasing stuff and have it completely bypass everything.

1617
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:26,000
But you can't advertise it on the Google Play Store.

1618
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:34,000
You can't have like it's, you know, be on there just to, you know, download that and load it in and just pay directly to Epic.

1619
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:39,000
You can't do that. So you've got to play by their rules if you want to be on their storefront.

1620
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Just the same as if I were to put something on epic storefront, I have to play by the rules in order to do that.

1621
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:49,000
I can't just say, well, you know, I don't know if they charge.

1622
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:54,000
See, that's the thing with Epic. I don't know if they charge for like, you know, a cut of any of the DLC and stuff like that.

1623
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:57,000
But let's just say that they do, because it would make sense if they did.

1624
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:02,000
But say I wanted to sell this stuff directly to my users instead, and I didn't want them to take a cut of that.

1625
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Well, I'm sure they wouldn't be happy about that. So it's the exact same thing.

1626
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Sorry, but not sorry. You have to abide by those rules to be on that storefront.

1627
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:15,000
I'm sorry that you're upset that you can't be on iOS devices.

1628
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:28,000
Now. Yeah. And look, and I said this on last week's show, like, yes, I'm firmly on Apple's side in this particular debacle as I'm wearing my AirPods and streaming this show from my Mac Mini.

1629
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:32,000
But guess what? Tim Sweeney tweets from his iPhone. So you know what?

1630
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:37,000
But I don't believe Apple is I want to make this clear. I don't believe Apple is right on everything.

1631
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:42,000
For example, the streaming and the cloud stuff and them holding back the X Cloud app.

1632
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:52,000
That is wrong. And they need to allow those apps because they allow if they allow Netflix, if they allow CBS All Access and those streaming apps to exist, they ought to be able to allow the gaming apps as well.

1633
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:57,000
I do believe that will work itself out in time.

1634
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:02,000
It's just a little slower because it's somewhat of a newer concept.

1635
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:06,000
But that is a separate issue.

1636
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:11,000
This epic thing has because I see some people confusing this on Twitter a little bit, too.

1637
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:15,000
This epic thing has nothing to do with the cloud streaming stuff.

1638
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:21,000
Not a thing. This is about the Apple in app store model.

1639
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:26,000
And honestly, I think and somebody will have to refresh my memory because I honestly don't recall.

1640
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Whatever happened with Sony and the other OS when they removed that from the console?

1641
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Did the court side because wasn't there a class action or I think we got a check in the mail.

1642
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:43,000
So it was but it was settled, not legally decided, right?

1643
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:51,000
Because I feel like I feel like the precedence is in that case.

1644
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Yes. So.

1645
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Yeah, I think it was settled.

1646
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
I was going to mention, though, kind of going back to the story there.

1647
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Microsoft had also filed a declaration in support of Epic's case against Apple, because, as I mentioned, with the developer access being removed, the Unreal Engine support and the ability to develop for that has been kind of harmed as well.

1648
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:20,000
So, you know, they have games that use the Unreal Engine.

1649
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:27,000
And because of that, you know, that that hurts not only them, but like even indie developers who use the Unreal Engine for.

1650
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:35,000
I feel like dear leader Sweeney sent Microsoft an email that it was I doubt it was a bullying email, but it was probably one of those.

1651
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:45,000
If Apple pulls us from the attention developers, if Apple's looking, they're they're recruiting people to do their dirty work and Microsoft fell for it.

1652
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:48,000
That is my that is my opinion on this in this particular case.

1653
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:52,000
And Phil Spencer, God bless him. He's done great things for Xbox.

1654
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:58,000
He fell for this one because Epic is recruiting people to do their dirty work and sent out an email.

1655
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:06,000
I bet you I bet you I bet you sent out an email that says if Apple does this, we're no longer going to be able to support you after such and such day.

1656
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:16,000
So we can't guarantee that your money making brand new force app you just put out is going to be able to make money because Apple's mean.

1657
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Well, I think, though, that they may have also vested interest because they're trying to get, you know, the game streaming as well on the iOS platform.

1658
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:31,000
But I don't think they didn't necessarily come out and say that.

1659
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Yeah, I don't think it will. Obviously, their negotiations for that type of stuff is probably a little bit more nuanced and say what Tim Sweeney did.

1660
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:48,000
But. I don't know, I'm just going for the whole thing to play out. I don't play Fortnite on iOS anyway, so.

1661
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Sorry, Bobby said the Microsoft thing was actually about Epic losing access to the developer tools, not about Fortnite.

1662
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:00,000
But those things are still hand in hand because they wouldn't have lost access to developer tools. They hadn't pulled the stunt with Fortnite.

1663
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:06,000
I'm surprised. I would love to know what Sony and Microsoft and Nintendo think about.

1664
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Hold on. Chat is already typing a comment. I just want to say, like, I don't know if Apple will hold firm to that.

1665
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:26,000
I think there's a very, and I don't know, but I think there's a very distinct possibility if the pressure from Microsoft and these other companies does anything,

1666
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:33,000
it will probably put a stay on this developer tool issue until they work out their other stuff.

1667
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:38,000
But Fortnite, I don't expect to come back until there's a settlement.

1668
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Because it won't be decided by court. There's going to be a settlement. I don't know. Well, I don't know.

1669
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:50,000
It depends what kind of hardball Apple wants to play here. I don't know. We'll see. We'll see.

1670
02:14:51,000 --> 02:15:02,000
And Bobby in chat is talking about how people are this is an epic maybe potentially saw an opportunity here to dogpile on Apple.

1671
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:08,000
I'm paraphrasing. Dogpile on Apple because they were already weakened by the xCloud argument on this.

1672
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:13,000
And that's why I'm going out of my way to say these are separate issues. And is it okay to say Apple?

1673
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:19,000
I don't think this is a good look, but I think this you're doing okay. Two different things.

1674
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
So. All right.

1675
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Dijarama says Apple does have a monopoly on the App Store. So also not surprised.

1676
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:34,000
What about Nintendo? What about Microsoft? What about Sony?

1677
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:45,000
Same thing, right? Technically true. It's technically true that they they have, you know, the monopoly there unless they're counting like retail sales because you can buy code sometimes at retail for those things.

1678
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:49,000
But I don't think so. But yeah, it's the same thing.

1679
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:57,000
And like and I would worry that like what is why? Why is Apple any different when it comes to.

1680
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:00,000
What's going to make them not try to do the same thing for consoles?

1681
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:07,000
I'm guessing because more of the market shares there, maybe they're making more money from there.

1682
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:11,000
I don't know. But like, yeah, I would.

1683
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:23,000
It's weird to see them try to burn bridges like that, because, I mean, you know, you have to work with all these other people, like in these other companies, and they see you doing this and it's like, well, they'd be less likely to want to work with you.

1684
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:26,000
You know, and that kind of talk was also going to.

1685
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:30,000
That's the kind of talk that gets you bought by Apple, too.

1686
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Yes, true when they just valued as like a two billion or two trillion dollar company this week or something was in the news.

1687
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:41,000
VG Realness says, I don't know why Apple can't offer a lower percentage cut, but offers zero advertising in their apps.

1688
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:46,000
You know, that was one place that I suggested a settlement could happen last week, sort of.

1689
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:53,000
I said, what if they could maybe allow the in-app purchasing off the store or whatever?

1690
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:57,000
But now Apple is going to charge them every time they want to do a reveal.

1691
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Every time you want to do a patch, every time you're going to put a new thing on the store because you're circumventing our store, we're now going to charge you.

1692
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:17,000
And I would I would bet even if Epic is victorious in this, that doesn't mean Apple doesn't immediately change their terms to say, all right, then we're going to get our money this way.

1693
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:27,000
I so I can't see that being a victorious. I'm pretty sure other companies will be the same. And like, it's not going to happen. Sorry.

1694
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Yeah, I just I just epic. I think Epic is fighting a losing battle here.

1695
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:39,000
And I think part of them kind of knows it. And that's why they're recruiting the Internet to help them out.

1696
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Because they want to they want to convict in the court of public opinion.

1697
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:56,000
The only the only way I could see like something happening where they could possibly get by with multiple storefronts is if they use the precedent set by where Microsoft had to.

1698
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:03,000
They could I think it was they couldn't have although they do have Internet Explorer like preloaded in there, but they couldn't.

1699
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:07,000
It is something to do with their web browser. Like they couldn't have like other stuff preloaded on there.

1700
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:13,000
They had to give you the option to be able to not use it or something. But I don't I don't remember the details.

1701
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:18,000
But I know that there has been precedent set with some of those types of cases antitrust stuff.

1702
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:23,000
But I don't think this can get that far. I think they're just going to say, nope, sorry.

1703
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:29,000
And the reality you agreed to those rules to that. The reality is a lot of us have passionate opinions on this particular topic.

1704
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:34,000
I have my opinions. Every single one of you in chat have your opinions. Loki has his opinion.

1705
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:38,000
The reality is none of it's going to matter. This is going to be decided by either a settlement.

1706
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:44,000
I would say 90 percent likely a settlement because that's how they always go or it'll be decided by a court.

1707
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:48,000
And let's be real. What happens in both of those places never makes sense.

1708
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Well, sometimes sometimes make sense, but it is probably not going to make sense to any of us.

1709
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:59,000
And that's that. So. All right. We'll see what develops next.

1710
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:06,000
I don't think this story is going away anytime soon. We'll see, especially with the deadline for the kit and all that coming up next.

1711
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:09,000
All right. Let's move on. We have a couple or just one more quick story for you.

1712
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:12,000
And then we'll get to the listener roundtable in our mailbag for tonight.

1713
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:17,000
So I'm getting to this story about Nintendo coming to Brazil.

1714
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:25,000
That's right. Officially. Now, of course, you know, we've heard about stories on the show before about how you can get video game consoles in countries where they're not officially supported.

1715
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:33,000
But that can be very, very expensive to do. So it could be very exciting news if you live in Brazil to hear that Nintendo is coming back.

1716
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Now, Nintendo was in Brazil up until about five years ago.

1717
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:45,000
So Nintendo is going to be debuting the Switch officially in Brazil because they left the country about five years ago.

1718
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:50,000
And Nintendo of America made a tweet saying, greetings to all the Brazilian Nintendo fans out there.

1719
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:53,000
We're excited to announce that the Nintendo Switch will be coming soon to Brazil.

1720
02:19:53,000 --> 02:20:01,000
So that's pretty exciting. As a reminder, Nintendo had originally pulled out in 2015 because of high tariffs on imported products.

1721
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:05,000
But now, you know, people are wanting a Switch and so forth.

1722
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:10,000
So, yeah, Brazil, by the way, the fourth largest gaming market in the world.

1723
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:16,000
Did you know that? Do you know who the top three are? Do you know who the top three are? Because it would surprise you.

1724
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:24,000
I don't know. One, two, three. But the other three are the US, China and India.

1725
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:31,000
Not Japan. You would have thought. But certainly consider the populations of China and India.

1726
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:35,000
And that would certainly. Oh, yes, there is a lot a lot of people in both those places.

1727
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:39,000
And that would explain why those are very those are also very, very big markets.

1728
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:44,000
So Brazil, the fourth largest market for games. Nintendo Switch finally officially making its way there.

1729
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:49,000
So congrats. All right. Moving on. Let's get to.

1730
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Hey, actually, I'm. Well, I think it's kind of a dumb question.

1731
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:58,000
I was going to say if because I'm going to ask act deft because I know him being in Mexico,

1732
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:02,000
he sometimes has problems with importing and stuff like that.

1733
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:10,000
But I guess it's probably going to be easier still to get products from the US than it would be to get stuff from Brazil because Brazil's further.

1734
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:15,000
So I'm just not sure if maybe that would improve the situation by giving other,

1735
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:21,000
you know, countries on this this hemisphere of the planet, but probably probably not.

1736
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:26,000
All right. Anyway, let's get to the listener roundtable.

1737
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:30,000
I'm going to wait. I'm going to come back to an answer if I see one. Meanwhile, we already have some questions coming in from chat.

1738
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:36,000
If you have any questions you want to ask us, you can go ahead and ask away in our chat room over twitch dot TV slash vog network.

1739
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:40,000
And I'll be getting to we have one email tonight. I will get to here shortly.

1740
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:46,000
First off, though, a question from no one special in our chat who asks if you could open up an arcade,

1741
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:54,000
what games would you include and would it be a straight up arcade, a barcade or a pizzeria arcade combo?

1742
02:21:54,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Well, in my opinion, the round one chain has things set up pretty good.

1743
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:03,000
You know, they have the Japanese games that are relevant to my interests.

1744
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:08,000
And that's the type of thing I'd love to have in my arcade. I would have more pinball than around one has.

1745
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:12,000
I could do without the bowling and the some of the stuff they do around one.

1746
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:18,000
It's just not really for my type of place. And also round one has a lot of those ticket redemption machines.

1747
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:22,000
I'm not big fans of those, but I'm also not an idiot.

1748
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:26,000
Here's here's the return question I would have. Is this arcade supposed to make money?

1749
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:29,000
Yes or no? Because the arcade supposed to make money.

1750
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:33,000
I'm going to have to have those ticket spinners because they make money.

1751
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:38,000
If my arcade doesn't need to make money, then I don't need as many of them.

1752
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:45,000
So, yeah, let me I'm going to answer for Loki. I'm using my powers of mind reading.

1753
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:51,000
Loki is going to simply open a QZAR. Am I right?

1754
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:55,000
That's not really. Yeah, I mean, I guess you're right.

1755
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:58,000
That's that's neither of the options that was provided.

1756
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:03,000
I mean, I'm going to go pizza place, obviously pizza arcade, if we're going to have to do something like that.

1757
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:07,000
And creepy, creepy, creepy animatronics.

1758
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:15,000
Yes, that's a must that sing every hour this time because, you know, why not?

1759
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Actually, that'd be really cool. Like like some pretty awesome animatronics, especially nowadays, you know, animatronic technology is really progressed.

1760
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:29,000
I want to license Five Nights at Freddy's and have a legit scary food chain.

1761
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:35,000
You know, there'd be a market for that and no fucking kids would go. Well, some might, but that would be amazing.

1762
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Is that like let's go to the murder pizzeria or what if he did like, you know, you did like a pizza place with an arcade themed after Freddy Fazbear.

1763
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:54,000
With an escape room with horror elements.

1764
02:23:54,000 --> 02:24:01,000
That sounds although pizza and alcohol, greasy fingers and alcohol are a dangerous combo for escape rooms, that's for sure.

1765
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
By the way, we have an answer from Act Deaf.

1766
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:13,000
Well, sort of I'll get back to you later because Act Deaf says, I really need to send you an email pretty much talking about the current video game situation in Mexico.

1767
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:16,000
In summary, we're getting taxed to hell and back.

1768
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:21,000
So it sounds like what was happening in Brazil for the last few years.

1769
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:24,000
In short, sounds like it. But I always welcome the emails.

1770
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:38,000
I love the perspectives from other countries around the world because I think so many people listening to this show, even if it like US, Canada, England or, you know, whatever country, Japan, wherever you're in, you tend to forget about the world sometimes outside of that bubble.

1771
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:44,000
And so I find these types of stories fascinating what some gamers go through just to play their fucking game.

1772
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
You know, it's it's pretty, pretty crazy.

1773
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:52,000
SJ100Matt kind of piggybacks on that and says, South America is very hard to get games there.

1774
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:59,000
I heard from someone in Argentina that they had to spend fifteen hundred dollars to just get a console out there because of tariffs and other taxes.

1775
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:06,000
Jesus, just let me buy one for you and sneak it in my suitcase. God damn, that's crazy.

1776
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:17,000
All right. Anyhow, let's get to the email, which I will do from my phone because I neglected to bring it up on the screen.

1777
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:23,000
So let's get to it. This email tonight comes to us from YYR.

1778
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:27,000
We always love hearing from YYR. It's a long email tonight, but that's OK.

1779
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Hello, LR. Please forgive the length of this email. Forgiven.

1780
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:36,000
I've been catching up on episodes and of course, I found a few things to chime in on.

1781
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:43,000
By the way, the title of this email is Rapid Fire Responses. Rob, thank you for plugging Sharpshooter Plus once again.

1782
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:48,000
And Loki, thanks for playing Pixel Poops on your Vita. You're welcome. You just got another plug. How about that?

1783
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
I didn't play it on my Vita, though.

1784
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
Oh, no.

1785
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:58,000
That's right. I have been playing it this week, though. I have been playing it on PC.

1786
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:03,000
OK. As long as you're playing the game, I don't think YYR cares where you're playing it.

1787
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:10,000
All right. A few weeks back, Rob said that he felt we've basically reached the pinnacle of video game graphics.

1788
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:17,000
I, too, once felt this way. It was back when the original Quake came out and I thought, that's it. We have real 3D now.

1789
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:22,000
All we have to do is increase the resolution. Clearly, there was more to do back then, around 20 years ago.

1790
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:27,000
If you want my honest opinion, there's still more to do. And 20 years from now, things will look amazing compared to now.

1791
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:36,000
Yeah. I mean, I kind of think we've plateaued a little bit right now, but that's not to say there won't be other advancements in the future.

1792
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:41,000
And what have we always said about gaming on this show? One step closer to the holodeck.

1793
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:49,000
And I think that's, I think maybe for two-dimensional images, we've gotten about as far as it feels like we're going to go right now.

1794
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:54,000
But we're going to have things that continue to move forward, like VR and AR.

1795
02:26:54,000 --> 02:27:06,000
And I really think what pushes graphics forward is going to come from those two places a little more than it is your traditional living room devices.

1796
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:14,000
And again, those devices are pushing things forward, too. It's just, it feels like the jump maybe isn't as big as it was in those eras you were talking about.

1797
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:25,000
But yeah, I mean, I remember the first time I played Mario Brothers 2 on my NES. I was like, this is like a cartoon. I'm playing a cartoon. This is crazy.

1798
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:35,000
Right? Because the graphics in Mario 2 were on fire. So, especially that ending where you had like cartoon Mario in the bed. I mean, spoiler alert for a 30-year-old game.

1799
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:39,000
But it looked like a fucking cartoon. It was a trip.

1800
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:47,000
All right. Anyway. Rob expressed disappointment that new Bomani games on PC never seem to come to North America.

1801
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:54,000
If you want my opinion, here's the likely reason it's not happening in two words. Music licensing.

1802
02:27:54,000 --> 02:28:01,000
My counter opinion to that opinion would be, why do you need Konami originals?

1803
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:11,000
But I get your point. Like, I'm not dismissing your point. But let's not forget, they did release Conomics over here for a reason.

1804
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:14,000
Because you don't have to worry about licensing fees in that department.

1805
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:23,000
In last week's discussion, disappointment was expressed because it appears that neither PS5 nor XSX will have great launch lineups.

1806
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:29,000
But is that really anything new? I would argue that no PlayStation has ever had a great launch lineup.

1807
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:35,000
And that Xbox hasn't had one since the 360. So this is probably not going to affect their long-term numbers much.

1808
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:39,000
I would agree with you on that. Like, what did the PlayStation 2 have going for it?

1809
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:45,000
Fantavision? Which, there's going to be a million people that pipe up and say, I fucking love Fantavision.

1810
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
Okay, that's fine. But let's be real, it wasn't-

1811
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:48,000
I love Fantavision.

1812
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:51,000
I know! Okay, we get it. You like Fantavision.

1813
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
We had it on the stream the other day. It was in the background.

1814
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:57,000
But it wasn't exactly that launch title.

1815
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:01,000
No, it wasn't. I rented that game too, so that wasn't necessarily- yeah.

1816
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:09,000
Alright. Anyway. Loki lamented the fact that Xbox One controllers still use AA batteries.

1817
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:14,000
Well, I'm glad they do. Because at least in my eyes, they are far superior to built-in rechargeable batteries.

1818
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:20,000
I purchased rechargeable AA batteries and a charger, and I always have a pair of charged batteries ready to go.

1819
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:24,000
When they die, I spend 30 seconds swapping batteries and I'm playing again.

1820
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:29,000
I never have to wait, I never have to find a charging cable, and I never ever have to plug the controller in.

1821
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:33,000
And if the batteries stop holding a charge in the future, replacing them is simple.

1822
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:37,000
I fail to see how a built-in battery is better.

1823
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:43,000
I mean, like, look at the Switch. I hate to say that, but look at the Switch and the Joy-Cons.

1824
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:49,000
I mean, they're always charged. I never have to worry about it because when I dock the thing, it's charging them.

1825
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:54,000
And it's never a problem. And let's say that one of those batteries craps out.

1826
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:58,000
I've taken apart the Switch and Joy-Cons. It's cake to replace that battery.

1827
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:03,000
It's like five minutes at most, and the part I think is probably about ten bucks.

1828
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:09,000
So, I mean, I don't know. I would rather have the built-in rechargeable battery.

1829
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:13,000
I will say AA batteries last forever though, more so than the rechargeable.

1830
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:18,000
Yeah, I mean, I guess if you make it power, you know, if you make it to the point-

1831
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Because, I mean, granted, I'm thinking back to the Xbox 360 and those batteries.

1832
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:27,000
Those things sucked battery power. Actually, even before that, the Wii remotes.

1833
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:30,000
Those things ate batteries for breakfast.

1834
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:38,000
Whereas, now I'm sure there's a lot more power-saving stuff that they can do to those controllers that make them last a little longer.

1835
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:42,000
So, I don't know. I can't really judge because I don't own an Xbox One controller.

1836
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
So, I can't say how long those batteries last.

1837
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
They last a while. I have one.

1838
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:57,000
Yeah, I would prefer, like, even the option that they had with, like, the Xbox 360 where I could plug in a rechargeable battery pack that's sold by Microsoft that I can just charge up that way if I wanted to.

1839
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:00,000
I like having the flexibility there, but I don't know if they have that.

1840
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:04,000
Just say you're thinking of the environment. Just say that.

1841
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
Sure. Thinking of the environment.

1842
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:10,000
All right. Moving on to the last point here.

1843
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:16,000
Finally, I'm going to say that I completely agree with your assessment of the Epic versus Apple thing that's happening right now.

1844
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:25,000
I try to be impartial whenever possible, and as a developer, I honestly feel that some of Apple's policies are a royal pain in the ass, but in my opinion, there's just no defending Epic here.

1845
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:30,000
Epic cries and cries about the 30% cut, but here's the thing.

1846
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:40,000
In the documents Apple has filed, they reveal they're getting about 100,000 app and update submissions per week, every single week.

1847
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
Review of these submissions is not automated.

1848
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Each one of these is reviewed by a living, breathing human person.

1849
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:56,000
Not to mention, Apple also provides developer support, tools, hosting, distribution, maintenance, and probably more than we don't even consider, all for zero out-of-pocket costs to developers.

1850
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:10,000
I'm sorry to interrupt. I would say one thing I really wish that they would fix if we're opening up everything is the fact that you have to have a Mac to develop on any of the Apple platforms is kind of lame. That's all.

1851
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:17,000
Okay. And I just got a notice that my little earbuds are about to die. So anyway, this is my first show I'm doing.

1852
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:20,000
Just switch out the AA batteries in them.

1853
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:24,000
Yeah, I know, right? I thought I could get through all three hours with them, but maybe not.

1854
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
So I might have to switch to something more old school here.

1855
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:30,000
Luckily, I have the old school stuff standing by just in case this should happen.

1856
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
Anyway, let me finish the email here, though.

1857
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:38,000
If the 30%... Fuck, I lost my place. Damn it.

1858
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:41,000
Oh, 100,000 app and update submissions per week, every single week.

1859
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:44,000
Review of these submissions is not automated.

1860
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:47,000
Each one of these is reviewed by a living, breathing human person.

1861
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:52,000
Not to mention, Apple also provides developer support, tools, hosting, distribution, maintenance,

1862
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:57,000
and probably more that we don't even consider, all for zero out-of-pocket costs to developers.

1863
02:32:57,000 --> 02:33:02,000
All of the salaries that go to staff supporting this stuff come right out of that 30% cut.

1864
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:09,000
Apple also claims that up to 80% of the apps on the store are 100% free with no in-app purchases.

1865
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:14,000
Apple doesn't make a dime on any of these. They still support them, though, and for free.

1866
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:17,000
One moment, please, while I switch this out. Loki, buy me time.

1867
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:22,000
Alright, well, since we're buying time, let's talk a little bit about Fall Guys.

1868
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:28,000
So, Fall Guys... So, I completely lost track. Gamescom's this week, so we have that to look forward to.

1869
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:32,000
So, they're going to have their opening night stream on August 27th, and apparently, they're going to show off

1870
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:37,000
Fall Guys Season 2 content at 11 a.m. Pacific, so tune in to check that out.

1871
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:42,000
I'm just going to tune in and check out all the trailers because I love that kind of stuff.

1872
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:45,000
And apparently, if you want Fall Guys on mobile, well, you're in luck.

1873
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:52,000
If you're in China, because they're going to be releasing the game over there at some point,

1874
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:58,000
it's being developed now by Bilibili. They've secured the rights to publish a mobile version of the game,

1875
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:03,000
which is funny because this is right after Fall Guys' official Twitter has been talking about

1876
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:09,000
how there's scams about mobile versions of Fall Guys, talking about how they're literally just pretending

1877
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:12,000
to play a game, and you can see the mouse pointer on the screen and stuff like that.

1878
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:15,000
It's a little bit confusing there, but...

1879
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:18,000
Why don't you let Stella play Fall Guys?

1880
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:23,000
She's across the room, hiding behind a bag, yelling at me for some reason.

1881
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:27,000
She wants you to move the bag. Anyway, I'm back, and I'm ready to finish YYR's email.

1882
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:32,000
Sorry, YYR, but you did admittedly have a long email, and the batteries to my headset literally died

1883
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
while I was reading it. Sorry.

1884
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
Anyway, finishing up the thought.

1885
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:41,000
If the 30% cut was to go away, the business model would likely need to completely change.

1886
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:46,000
Submitting or resubmitting an app, upgrading developer tools, and bandwidth used by customers

1887
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:50,000
might all start coming with a cost to developers. This sounds familiar.

1888
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:56,000
This would likely wipe out the smallest developers and cause the largest ones to stop releasing free apps.

1889
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:59,000
Things would change considerably, and I don't think it would be for the better.

1890
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Anyway, if you got this far, thanks for reading, and please look forward to an announcement regarding Pixel Poops soon.

1891
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
Yeah, why not?

1892
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:12,000
And that is signed. Have a great week, Aaron, or YYR.

1893
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:15,000
Well, thank you, YYR, for the email. Appreciate it as always.

1894
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
Appreciate your perspective, even when you do disagree.

1895
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:20,000
After all, it is the show where every gamer has a voice.

1896
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:23,000
And yeah, that Epic Apple thing is sure bringing out a lot of big opinions.

1897
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:27,000
But, like I said earlier, none of us are going to answer this.

1898
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
So, but I think you do bring up a good point.

1899
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:33,000
Like, you know, Apple does review a lot of the free apps, too.

1900
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:37,000
And what's going to happen to them if suddenly there's going to be a cost to review stuff?

1901
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:40,000
That's why I think there's maybe going to have to be a little give and take.

1902
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
But we'll see. We'll see.

1903
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:46,000
You know, there was that weird story about how Apple had pulled WordPress or something

1904
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:50,000
because they thought WordPress was selling outside the app, but I guess they cleared it up.

1905
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:54,000
But it wasn't a good story to come. It just gave Epic ammunition is all it did.

1906
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:59,000
All right. Anyhow, that's it for the mailbag.

1907
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:03,000
If you want to send us an email for a future week, participate at orangelaungeradio.com

1908
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
is the place to send us an email.

1909
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:09,000
Logan, did you have any other last minute stories besides the fall guy stuff you snuck in there?

1910
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
No, I didn't really have anything.

1911
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Fair enough. Well, we're almost to 9 o'clock anyway, so I think it's a good time to wrap up.

1912
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:19,000
So I want to thank you guys for either downloading our show, listening live,

1913
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
however you participated with Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

1914
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
Thank you so much for being a part of it.

1915
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
We will be back next week to do it all again.

1916
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:28,000
We will not be here in two weeks.

1917
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:31,000
We will have the night off for Labor Day weekend, as we always have,

1918
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:35,000
because I'm usually at Dragon Con, and that's going to be the case again this year.

1919
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:40,000
I'm just going to be there virtually, and I'm actually doing a panel during the time that Orange Lounge Radio is.

1920
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:43,000
I'll give you the rundown on all the panels I'm going to be on next week.

1921
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:46,000
Bobby talked about some of it on his show.

1922
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
I just don't have the times in front of me. Oops.

1923
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:55,000
But I know I'm going to be on Bobby's panel that is about the conversion from audio podcasting to video podcasting,

1924
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
called Video Didn't Kill the Radio Star.

1925
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
I'm going to be on that panel.

1926
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:02,000
I'm also going to be on a panel about networking and content networks

1927
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:07,000
and what are the advantages and disadvantages of joining a network for your content creation.

1928
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:10,000
This is a pretty regular panel. I think Bobby has done this panel before.

1929
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
They do this a lot at Dragon Con.

1930
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:16,000
It's an important part of the digital media track, so I'm going to represent us this year.

1931
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
So that's going to be very exciting.

1932
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:22,000
And then another panel I'm doing, this one even surprises me that I'm doing it,

1933
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:32,000
but it's actually going to be about how educators have had to adapt to technology with what's going on,

1934
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
basically with COVID and everything.

1935
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:41,000
And so a lot of the tricks and techniques that we've learned from our digital media creation is coming into education.

1936
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:47,000
Now I think when they originally pitched this panel, it was high school and grade school teachers that were doing this

1937
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:51,000
because obviously they've gone through quite a change this year.

1938
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:55,000
But they posted in the Digital Media Dragon Con Discord and were like,

1939
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:59,000
hey, are there any other educators out there that might want to be on this panel?

1940
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:04,000
And you guys might not know this, I'm an educator but not in a grade school.

1941
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:09,000
I'm a corporate educator, so I work with corporate training and teaching adults.

1942
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
And we've gone through a lot of changes as well.

1943
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:15,000
We teach in classrooms and things like that that we're not able to do right now.

1944
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:20,000
So I actually sent a little thing off and I was like, I don't know if this is what you're looking for.

1945
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:24,000
And they actually really, they were like, oh, that's a good perspective.

1946
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
So they actually really welcomed me with open arms.

1947
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
So I'm really excited to be a part of that.

1948
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:35,000
So it's going to be a very rare opportunity to hear me talk about my day job and my hobby.

1949
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:39,000
And I don't talk about my day job a lot because I like to keep that stuff separated.

1950
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:43,000
So this one's going to be a little bit nerve-wracking in some ways.

1951
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:47,000
But I think I can represent, I can walk the line and represent both sides fairly.

1952
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
I think it's going to be a very good discussion.

1953
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:52,000
So that is, and that, I talk a little more about that panel

1954
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:56,000
because that is the one that's airing where OLR would be.

1955
02:38:56,000 --> 02:39:00,000
It's actually like, it's 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern on Sunday.

1956
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
So that'll be very interesting.

1957
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:05,000
So, all right.

1958
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:09,000
Anyway, so I'll go over all that in more detail again next week.

1959
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:12,000
But that's Virtual Dragon Con happening in two weeks and there won't be an OLR.

1960
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
And there won't be a Bobby Black Wolf that night either.

1961
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:17,000
So VOG is just going to be dark that night.

1962
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:20,000
And some of you guys are probably going to be doing stuff for the long Labor Day weekend anyway.

1963
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:24,000
However, please remember COVID isn't gone.

1964
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Just because you're over it doesn't mean it's gone.

1965
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:30,000
So you keep masks, keep social distancing, keep washing your hands, etc., etc.

1966
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:33,000
Listen to scientists, listen to doctors.

1967
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:36,000
So anyway, thank you so much for tuning into our show.

1968
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
We will be back next week to do it all over again

1969
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
and talk about the gaming news that comes up this week.

1970
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:45,000
I will, with the two-week thing, sorry, I'm thinking aloud here.

1971
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:48,000
But, and I haven't even talked to Loki and Dark Sakura about this.

1972
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:53,000
Even though there's not going to be a live OLR Sunday night,

1973
02:39:53,000 --> 02:40:02,000
if Microsoft, Sony, or Nintendo makes a massive announcement that week,

1974
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
which very well could be possible,

1975
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:09,000
we will look at doing a special OLR at some point midweek

1976
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:14,000
to wrap up whatever that is, just depending on my co-host's availability.

1977
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:15,000
But right, Loki-

1978
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:16,000
It's special, after school special.

1979
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
It's going to have to, I mean, that makes sense, right, Loki?

1980
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:21,000
Like, I wouldn't want to miss that week and then that ends up being the week

1981
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
that Sony unveiled their price and date, you know?

1982
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:30,000
So we're not planning a live show, but we might do a mini or something.

1983
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:31,000
So just kind of throwing that out there.

1984
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
A direct.

1985
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:36,000
I guess, yeah, a direct to answer the direct.

1986
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:39,000
All right, anyway, thank you so much for listening to our show,

1987
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
however you found it, or listening live.

1988
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:44,000
If you enjoyed the show, help us spread the word,

1989
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:45,000
tell a friend or two about the show,

1990
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

1991
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
but in order to put those voices out there,

1992
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:52,000
we've got to have them here in our chat, or in our email bag,

1993
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
on our Twitter, at OLR.

1994
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:55,000
Tell a friend about the show.

1995
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:58,000
Auto-hosting on Twitch goes a super long way.

1996
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
That's probably the single most powerful thing you can do.

1997
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Even if you don't stream yourself, add VOG Network to your auto-host list.

1998
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:05,000
It goes a long way.

1999
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:12,000
And yeah, oh, Bobby's pointing out PAX Online is after Dragon Con this year,

2000
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:13,000
so that they're not overlapping.

2001
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:17,000
That's kind of neat, because usually PAX and Dragon Con overlap, yeah.

2002
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
All right, I think that's it.

2003
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:20,000
We're on our way out.

2004
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:21,000
Final thought time.

2005
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:24,000
So, Loki, do you have any final thoughts for us tonight?

2006
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:31,000
I'm just going to keep on working on things, so that's it.

2007
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:32,000
Good luck with things.

2008
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:36,000
My final thought is I'm going to keep grinding that Yo-kai Watch event

2009
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:40,000
and get my glowy mount, darn it, because that's what it's all about,

2010
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
the eternal pursuit of a glowy mount.

2011
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:45,000
Thank you so much for listening to Orange Launch Radio tonight

2012
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
and making us a part of your week.

2013
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:48,000
Happy gaming.

2014
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:49,000
Be nice to each other.

2015
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
Be safe.

2016
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:52,000
Be well.

2017
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:53,000
Have a great week.

2018
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:54,000
Bye.

2019
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:25,000
See you next week.

2020
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:55,000
Bye.
