34600	38220	actual news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
38220	47340	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where
47340	49300	every gamer has a voice.
49300	57100	It is Orange Lounge Radio Live once again tonight with episode number 834 for this August
57100	59020	the 30th of 2020.
59020	65000	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm joined here as I usually am via the magic of Discord by
65000	66980	DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
66980	67980	Hello.
67980	68980	Hi.
68980	69980	How are you doing?
69980	70980	I'm alright.
70980	71980	Yeah.
71980	72980	It's been quite a week.
72980	73980	Yeah.
73980	77980	It's been emotional and difficult.
77980	78980	Absolutely.
78980	79980	Absolutely.
79980	84080	You know, and I think, you know, again, I know we talk about video games, but there's
84080	87980	a lot of other stuff that happens in the world too, and right at the top of last week's show,
87980	91700	we were kind of talking about the great loss that, you know, we were, you and I were feeling
91700	95320	with the drag community and the loss of Chi Chi Devane, right?
95320	100780	And now just, you know, days ago, we're getting this news about, you know, we lost Chadwick
100780	106620	Boseman, which was a shock to obviously a lot of people because, you know, he had kept
106620	111660	his illness and what he was battling for four years, a secret, which he had every right
111660	116200	to do, obviously, and, you know, obviously, but now it's like you go back and you look
116200	119740	at everything that he was doing with those movies and, you know, visiting the kids and
119740	123840	the hospitals and everything, and just the stuff he was doing for, you know, the black
123840	129460	community and, you know, the things he contributed to the Marvel universe and just everything
129460	130860	he was doing.
130860	131860	And he was battling that.
131860	132860	He was the embodiment of representation.
132860	133860	Mm-hmm.
133860	141660	I mean, and he was the embodiment of like a good person and just to lose that is horrible.
141660	149040	Not just as a black man, but also for invisible illnesses, because he did hide it very well.
149040	150040	Yeah.
150040	151040	There's a lot of us who are suffering.
151040	157240	I mean, the same thing actually a few years ago happened with Liz Slaton of Doctor Who.
157240	159020	She was Sarah Jane Smith.
159020	164520	But I mean, of course, you know, the representation issue is not the same, but I'm saying that
164520	170100	you shouldn't assume something about somebody because they appear to be able-bodied.
170100	176440	You know, if someone says, I have this issue, just believe them and act accordingly.
176440	178000	And he didn't even say anything.
178000	182160	So that was, I don't know.
182160	184800	Kelly Preston was another example of that as well.
184800	185800	Yeah.
185800	186800	Yeah.
186800	187800	Yeah.
187800	189080	Had passed away with battling cancer.
189080	193780	So just a big, hearty fuck cancer here at the top of the show.
193780	196240	And that's just such a tremendous loss.
196240	201140	I mean, I can't claim to be the person that's there every weekend when a new Marvel movie
201140	202540	opens.
202540	209920	But at the same time, I do see like how Chadwick Boseman was so important to so many people.
209920	214020	And it's just, this is a year.
214020	215020	This is a year.
215020	217060	I just, I don't know what else to say.
217060	218380	All right.
218380	222380	So the difficult transition to also say hello to Techmaster Loki.
222380	223380	How are you?
223380	224380	Hello.
224380	225380	I'm fine.
225520	226520	Say something funny.
226520	229840	We've got to try to change the tone a little bit before we get into games.
229840	230840	I know.
230840	233480	How about that animal crossing stream we did earlier this week?
233480	234480	That was a lot of fun.
234480	235480	Right?
235480	236480	Yeah.
236480	237480	Yeah.
237480	238480	I wasn't, you know, I had built that whole thing.
238480	239560	It's like a Jamie and Rob show.
239560	242480	I didn't know you would be as into it as you were.
242480	244880	I didn't, uh, but it wasn't just you really.
244880	246640	It was, you know, Nelly was in the background.
246640	249480	You could hear her and your kid, one of your kids was there too.
249480	250480	Yes.
250480	251480	Yes.
251480	253920	The two that actually play the game.
253920	255360	We're kind of leading the tour.
256340	257340	That stream was a lot of fun though.
257340	258340	I'm glad we did it.
258340	261580	Um, if you don't know what we're talking about, uh, of course, uh, we do, well, we taped this
261580	266460	show orange launch radio live every week at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash
266460	271100	a VOG network or VOG network Sunday nights at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern,
271100	272500	right after the Bobby black Wolf show.
272500	278260	But sometimes we do some other things on the network and this was one of those experimental
278260	279260	things.
279260	281380	So Thursday night we did like a special live show.
281380	283860	Uh, and we, it was actually like two hours.
283860	288840	We spent playing animal crossing and just looking at all the creativity on your guys's
288840	291480	islands, uh, was, was really amazing.
291480	295760	Uh, dark soccer, your Island is, is so cool.
295760	297320	And um, thank you.
297320	301080	And Loki yours is too, especially when you consider how much your kid contributed to
301080	304680	that is, uh, you know, I kept joking like it's mostly Nelly.
304680	305680	All right.
305680	309400	Well, they said, don't, don't, don't sell the kids by the way.
309400	310400	Oh, you're welcome.
310400	311400	Yeah, no problem.
311580	312580	And thank you for the stuff.
312580	314500	Cause I got the posters and stuff afterwards.
314500	318020	Anyway, I forgot what I was supposed to some Loki though, or what Nelly wanted.
318020	319020	She wanted the fruit.
319020	324860	We got her all up on the fruit and then, um, I don't remember.
324860	329980	I know my son wanted like one of those like 3d wallpapers, either the space one or the
329980	331220	spaceship one.
331220	333660	I don't know how easy those are.
333660	338020	Um, those are actually know that some of them I can make, I can make some of them.
338020	340500	I think the star one is a Celeste pattern.
340500	341680	I think it is.
341680	344640	I have all of the Celeste patterns, so cool.
344640	350600	So anyway, my wife's yelling to me, Oh, it's the wife placed in an order.
350600	351600	Sorry.
351600	353600	It's so funny.
353600	356040	She wanted an omelet in the skillet.
356040	361280	Oh, all you need to do is make the skillet and customize it.
361280	362280	Oh yeah.
362280	363280	The mega skill and customize it.
363280	364280	Okay.
364280	365280	Yeah.
365280	367080	I have pizza in mine cause I have my pizza oven area.
367080	370860	Anyway, if you want to hear two hours of this, if you're an animal crossing fan, it
370860	371860	is in the archives.
371860	372860	Oh yeah.
372860	373860	We'll do it again.
373860	374860	It's in the archive.
374860	376620	And because this now we've shown all our islands.
376620	381080	Now we get to show other people's islands and that, so that'll be fun.
381080	387220	So anyway, to clarify act up, that's not my house that we showed off.
387220	388220	That was my wife's house.
388220	391620	My house is one single room and it has just a bunch of random garbage in there.
391620	393540	Cause I don't really play the game.
393540	399320	That was my wife's house with the interesting basement, which, which I don't think the kids
399320	401120	were supposed to see.
401120	402120	Anyway.
402120	403120	All right.
403120	408920	Uh, if you want to see that it is in the archives over at VOG network, uh, we're not going to
408920	412280	be putting it out as a podcast cause it just relies so heavily on video.
412280	416080	Um, so that is one of the getting, you could either watch it live when we did it, or if
416080	420080	you want to go back in the video archives, um, subscribers, uh, at VOG network over on
420080	424380	Twitch, get access to the complete video archive, which will, would include, um, the animal
424380	428260	crossing special and any future specials, uh, that we do as well.
428260	432900	And you can, uh, subscribe to VOG network using your free subscription that you get
432900	436100	with prime gaming, formerly known as Twitch prime.
436100	441180	You can use your free sub to subscribe right here at VOG network or, um, sub tempers coming
441180	442180	up.
442180	444580	And I think we have a story on it later in the show and it's going to make subscribing,
444580	447140	um, even, even cheaper if you want to do it that way.
447140	448140	We appreciate it.
448140	452200	You don't have to, uh, but that is how you can access the video archive, um, on Twitch
452200	453760	if you want to check that out.
453760	454760	All right.
454760	458460	So anyhow, let's get into some gaming news and, uh, kick off our show tonight with some
458460	463280	talk about gamescom because, uh, uh, that was a big event that happened this week, even
463280	464280	if it didn't happen in person.
464280	465280	Right.
465280	466280	Logie.
466280	467280	Yes.
467280	468820	So that was a pretty neat event.
468820	474840	They had like kind of their kickoff live stream with Jeff Keeley showing off a bunch of trailers
474840	476420	and talking about announcements and things.
476420	481700	So some of the stuff they showed off this year, a new trailer for the Jurassic world
481700	482700	evolution.
482700	489760	Now coming to the switch, um, there was a, I don't remember if there's much gameplay,
489760	494620	but there was a new trailer for call of duty, uh, black ops, cold war.
494620	496480	And that's going to be coming out in November 13th.
496480	501800	They showed the first game play of the upcoming expansion for doom eternal called the ancient
501800	504200	gods part one.
504200	512460	Um, they did a little tease for surgeon simulator two, which is out now, um, with, uh, doc Brown
512460	515420	in there for some reason, I'm not really sure.
515420	518540	Wait, wait, from like back to the future, doc Brown or back to the future.
518540	519540	Yes.
519540	523540	So I'm not really sure how that tied into it, but why not?
523540	524540	Why not?
524540	527260	But search and simulator is like a wacky game.
527260	531100	Like the title makes it sounds, Oh, flight simulator.
531100	532100	That's some serious business.
532100	535800	The search and simulator is wacky, even worse.
535800	536800	Yeah.
536800	540800	Going back to call of duty, is it just me or does it look like Robert Redford?
540800	541800	It does.
541800	544360	And I was looking, I seriously, I was like, is that Robert Redford?
544360	547080	Cause it it's down to the hair.
547080	548080	It's absolutely Robert Redford.
548080	552080	And I wouldn't be surprised if that's Robert Redford playing that part, but that's why
552080	553080	I kept seeing the trailer.
553080	555600	I was like, that is that Robert Redford?
555600	562080	I even like, I actually pulled up a picture of him to, to make sure I'm like, Oh, maybe
562660	566580	they use like hyper realistic license likenesses in those games.
566580	571020	That's the same game that all the Ronald Reagan stuff that's showing up on Twitter is from,
571020	572020	right?
572020	573020	Yeah.
573020	574020	Yeah.
574020	575020	And yeah.
575020	578960	And other celebrities in the past that may not have Greece, um, history also in those
578960	579960	games.
579960	583140	Um, but yeah, it definitely looks like Robert Redford.
583140	586020	I would not be surprised if it's Robert Redford, they didn't.
586020	590740	I would think that that was something that, um, if that was him, that they would kind
590740	594640	of call that out being like, you know, Hey, we've got Robert Redford in this.
594640	599400	Um, but cause, you know, gamers love Robert Redford.
599400	603960	I know if we, if we were to pull our chat and ask like top three celebrities, go heaven
603960	606480	spacey because that was a thing.
606480	610880	So yeah, but look at, look at what we had for death stranding, you know, going back
610880	617160	to our, our, uh, you know, seventies and eighties famous actors, you know, true.
617160	620180	And contemporary cause you know, obviously walking dead is huge.
620180	621180	Yeah.
621180	622180	But yeah.
622180	623180	Uh, search and see me later too, though.
623180	624180	It looks like a lot of fun.
624180	628260	It's co-op this time and there's a lot of like running around and doing things and severing
628260	631500	arms and stuff to like get to other rooms and things.
631500	632580	It looks really crazy.
632580	634140	So it, that'll be fun too.
634140	639680	That's not VR, but, um, soon probably at some point, uh, they showed some behind the scenes
639680	643140	of the new dragon age game, uh, is really just a bunch of like concept art.
643140	646780	So I have no idea what the heck this game is going to look like, but it's already out
647400	648760	Why don't you defer to Jamie?
648760	657080	There's a new salmon max VR game that they've, uh, were teasing.
657080	658480	So I'm all about that.
658480	664800	Um, as you can see by my background, um, they did a trailer for the new world of Warcraft
664800	669640	expansion shadow lands, which looks like world of Warcraft.
669640	670640	Yeah.
670640	676540	Not, uh, not really a fan of that series, so I'm sure it's important to somebody, um,
676540	680200	they talked a little bit about crash four with some of the gameplay elements for that.
680200	685600	They shut off a trailer for little nightmares two, which looks pretty darn creepy.
685600	690080	Um, showed a little bit more of the VR gameplay from star Wars squadrons.
690080	695020	Uh, they have a star Wars themed expansion for the Sims four.
695020	696020	That looks pretty cool.
696020	697080	Did you watch the trailer?
697080	699200	I missed the trailer for that one.
699200	703360	Unfortunately, it might be enough to get me back into Sims four.
703360	704360	It looked pretty cool.
704360	707500	Uh, they showed off a new trailer for mafia, the definitive edition, which looks pretty
707500	708500	cool.
708500	710460	I'd never played the original games, but I heard they're pretty good.
710460	715580	Um, Lego star Wars, the Skywalker saga, um, which looks pretty nice.
715580	719340	I have never really played the Lego star Wars games, but I played all the other ones, so
719340	720340	why not?
720340	725660	Uh, they show fall guy season two, kind of a sneak peek of what the new courses are.
725660	731140	Um, they have a little bit of a, a little bit of a, a little bit of a, a, a, a, a, a
731140	735840	season two kind of a sneak peek of what the new courses and, uh, themes are going to be.
735840	737120	It's all medieval themes.
737120	742480	So they have new costumes and courses based around that, uh, new VR medal of honor game
742480	746520	from respawn, a medal of honor above and beyond, which looks pretty cool.
746520	751720	Uh, um, destiny beyond light.
751720	756600	I mean, I'm surprised that does seem to still going, uh, well, it's, it's making that huge
756600	758020	shift to free to play.
758020	761100	Um, and there's other big shifts that are coming with the game.
761100	762940	I, well, I already own it.
762940	766700	I mean, so like the free to play doesn't really change things, but I am kind of curious to
766700	767740	check it out again.
767740	772080	I know the free to play transitions have been somewhat controversial, like the archiving
772080	773840	of the old contents, a little weird.
773840	777420	I am curious to check out the game again in its current state.
777420	778420	I do.
778420	783740	There's, you know, I don't play a lot of shooters, but I did enjoy destiny, you know, and what's,
783740	784980	what's interesting.
785000	791640	Do you guys remember, um, pre pandemic and it was probably January of 2019, um, here
791640	796560	at OLR studios, we had all the, um, the women of ingress, the mobile phone game I played,
796560	797560	maybe it was 2018.
797560	798560	It was a while ago.
798560	800560	We had, we had all those gals here in studio, right.
800560	802400	That I'll play ingress mobile.
802400	803400	Okay.
803400	805160	Like a ton of them now play destiny.
805160	807840	Well, they still play ingress, but they play destiny too.
807840	810560	And they've been trying to get me to play with them except they play destiny too on
810560	813960	X-Box and I'll have it on X-Box.
813960	817900	Well, can't you play cross-play though with like other systems, like the very least the
817900	819020	PC version?
819020	823920	I think there is that, but we have the game pass version coming out soon anyway.
823920	827660	So that's what I'm going to just wait for is when destiny two's on game pass and then
827660	831540	I can play with them and they can carry me cause they're probably all super high levels
831540	832560	and stuff.
832560	836820	So I just thought it was interesting that destiny two was the game they all got sucked
836820	838580	into in their spare time.
838580	839580	Yeah.
840360	844880	Some other neat trailers that they had, they showed off a new trailer for 12 minutes, which
844880	849160	was that kind of I don't even know how to describe it.
849160	854680	It's like a weird, like a drama type game where you're going to be attacked or something
854680	859400	by some intruders, but they've got a lot of, it's like a time loop game, but they've got
859400	861380	a really cool cast in it.
861380	865000	So Daisy Ridley, James McAvoy and William Defoe.
865000	867760	So awesome.
867760	868960	That looks cool.
868960	876100	And then they showed off some new trailers for Outriders, which looks interesting Spellbreak,
876100	882980	Age of Empires three, definitive edition, Godfall, which the more they show that I just
882980	888300	really don't care WWE battlegrounds.
888300	892980	Why would the big head mode, like, like you can do an arcade game, like NBA Jam or something
892980	895300	like that without everybody having giant heads.
895300	896300	It looks weird.
896300	901720	Um, so yeah, that was pretty much it.
901720	903680	So what did you think overall of it?
903680	907080	I don't know, it was nothing like huge and exciting.
907080	911120	There's like, I mean, there was some like interesting announcements, but it wasn't like
911120	914000	blowing my, you know, blowing me away.
914000	919160	It was just kind of like, oh yeah, you know, cool VR, Sam, Max, and the rest I could just
919160	922200	kind of do without, I mean, I don't know.
922200	924720	Um, I'm just like, whatever for VR.
924720	928340	I was a little excited to see some of the prelims for Dragon Age four, but that's really
928340	929780	about it for me.
929780	930780	It's very good.
930780	931780	Like underwhelming.
931780	933580	I think they didn't really have like some really huge announcements.
933580	938660	I'm assuming that a lot of the, um, whereas we would have gotten probably a lot more announcements
938660	944220	from the big three, um, during one of these types of events, but being that we're in like
944220	949920	pandemic mode here, that everybody who's been doing their own like digital events and they've
949920	951340	been announcing everything there.
951340	956040	So I think this is kind of like the leftover scraps, which is fine because there's a lot
956040	961120	of like other companies that can, you know, show off their games that might not necessarily,
961120	968600	you know, be highlighted in one of those, um, it was okay.
968600	973280	I guess I, they, I know they were streaming like for three days, like showing different
973280	975680	things, but I didn't catch any of the other footage.
975680	979980	So like, I couldn't tell you if there's any, I don't think there was any other announcements,
979980	983500	but I don't know.
983500	984500	It is what it is.
984500	985500	Um, yeah.
985500	989160	I mean, it was, it was a little, I, it was both kind of like a bad thing and a good thing
989160	994880	that like there was nothing like Sony or Microsoft, like kind of first party in those because
994880	997560	obviously they want to do their own things.
997560	1001440	And both those companies are probably feeling the pressure of, they're going to have to
1001440	1004680	announce that date and price pretty darn soon here.
1004680	1009520	Or I don't already do them pre-orders I mean, or they're starting pre-orders in these systems
1009520	1010520	already.
1010520	1014260	So it's like, well, well, if you're talking about the Sony thing, cause that's like a,
1014260	1018460	it's a pre pre-order cause cause pre-orders aren't enough anymore.
1018460	1019460	Low key.
1019460	1020460	No, no, no, no, no.
1020460	1025700	In the year 2020 we have pre pre-orders, which you, which literally is you're entering a
1025700	1030580	raffle to get the opportunity to pre-order a PlayStation five.
1030580	1035080	You know, as, as much as I'm being a SAS master on this whole thing, I actually kind of get
1035080	1039340	it because I think what they're doing is really trying to go the extra mile to prevent scalper
1039340	1040340	burrs.
1040340	1043760	And from that viewpoint, I'm actually very appreciative.
1043760	1046960	So hype is what I'm thinking they're trying to do.
1046960	1049280	Like, I don't think it's scalpers necessarily.
1049280	1053360	It could be part that, but it, what, what it is having that effect that it's going to
1053360	1055280	be a lot harder for scalpers to get them.
1055280	1060520	And for that I'm thankful, um, bar none, but yeah, it's kind of like, where is the fricking
1060520	1061560	price and date?
1061560	1065640	Now we're starting to get into that whole, okay, we we've been giving them plenty of
1065640	1069200	time, but times like if these things are releasing in November.
1070060	1076140	Well, we got a bunch of people, the, so the rumor is, um, just making sure we don't have
1076140	1077740	said rumor in our story.
1077740	1082460	Uh, so the rumor is that they're going to start pre-orders on the PlayStation, uh, five
1082460	1088780	on September 9th, because it's the anniversary of the original PlayStation is the rumor.
1088780	1094820	So I guess we only have a, you know, a couple more weeks to see if that's true or not.
1094820	1095820	Yeah.
1095880	1100280	By the time OLR is back, uh, because we will be, we won't be here next week.
1100280	1101920	We'll talk a little more about that in a minute.
1101920	1104400	Um, but it'll be after September 9th.
1104400	1109120	So I got to see the price too, like, cause, cause you know, there's people, I mean, obviously
1109120	1112780	there's nothing really substantiated yet, but like, there's like talk that some of these
1112780	1118860	systems are going to be over a thousand dollars, like, nope, um, not happening.
1118860	1123600	She-Hulk 10 in chat, uh, says delayed 2021 COVID.
1123600	1126220	You know, you're certainly not the first to say that.
1126220	1129820	And I think there was a big Kotaku article that was written up on the subject about,
1129820	1132980	you know, what should, should they just wait till next year at this point?
1132980	1136060	And I know, and I should have just invited him back to sit with us again, uh, on the
1136060	1137060	show.
1137060	1141060	But, uh, my buddy Delvin, VGRealness had brought this up in one of our chats is that I just
1141060	1144060	like just fucking delay them to next year already.
1144060	1147340	Like this, this year is, is shit.
1147340	1152220	Just let it go down the drain and let's just try to focus on making next year bigger.
1152240	1155880	And that would include the consoles, just put them out next year at this point.
1155880	1160200	Um, and I, I have to kind of admit points were made.
1160200	1168640	Like, I, I don't know if I'm super into, like, I need to have these consoles this year.
1168640	1172040	When this year started, I definitely thought that, but just with everything that we've
1172040	1175760	all been through this year, I'm kind of at the point where I'm like, I kind of think
1175760	1178480	I'm only going to end up getting one or the other this year and I'm going to wait till
1178480	1179480	next year.
1180340	1183580	Which is fine too.
1183580	1188020	Who has the best launch games because, you know, that's really what it comes down to.
1188020	1193420	And now, you know, other rumors out there about other enhancements coming, um, you know,
1193420	1197060	maybe I get one of those so I can actually have a console to play on.
1197060	1198060	Yeah.
1198060	1201540	My family isn't monopolizing, but, um, yeah, I don't know.
1201540	1208740	I was, uh, both are kind of expensive like right now I think, but because I'm not taking
1208800	1213720	my family out every weekend, I can kind of afford to announce, I guess it'd be fine.
1213720	1217640	Let me, let me, let me ask an impromptu question of our chat room because we are the show where
1217640	1218680	every gamer has a voice.
1218680	1221620	I want to hear specifically your guys' voices on this.
1221620	1227880	What would be your reaction if next week it hits the media, Sony and Microsoft, both just
1227880	1233460	coincidentally back to back, same day, whatever they both announce, um, due to the pandemic,
1233460	1238320	due to, you know, whatever they say, we're going to push back these releases 2021.
1238320	1243280	We're going to push back the release of both these systems to let's say March, 2021.
1243280	1245920	They're going to try to still squeeze in the same fiscal year.
1245920	1247960	How would you feel?
1247960	1249360	Just kind of throwing that out there.
1249360	1251600	I'm really curious to hear how the chatters might feel.
1251600	1252700	Would you be relieved?
1252700	1257040	Cause it's like, Oh, I've got more time to, would you feel, would you feel a little sad
1257040	1261580	because you were really hoping like, Oh, I kind of need, I needed something to look forward
1261580	1263720	to during all this and now it's being delayed.
1263720	1265080	Like I'm really curious.
1265080	1266080	Um, okay.
1266080	1271440	So looking in chat, you guys are quick, uh, she Hulk says sad, but better to do it right
1271440	1273480	than fast and broken.
1273480	1277320	Insert that famous line about a good game is, or a bad game is bad forever and that
1277320	1278320	whole thing.
1278320	1279320	Right?
1279320	1280320	Uh, Bobby Blackwell says, I'd be fine.
1280320	1281320	As join her.
1281320	1282320	Matt says, I'd be fine.
1282320	1283760	Pixel pocket says, I wouldn't mind.
1283760	1286140	Did your MS says, doesn't bother me.
1286140	1290120	So I'm here, you know, that's only five people in chat, but still I'm hearing a resounding
1290120	1298080	kind of seems to be the verdict, you know, that's all I need is cyberpunk.
1298080	1299160	So it's all good.
1299160	1301600	But cyberpunk is going to be on the current Jen.
1301600	1305560	So it doesn't like that's also going to be on the other one and I'm getting on PC.
1305560	1308560	So, you know, it's fine.
1308560	1309560	I have that.
1309560	1312360	I have that regardless of, um, whatever they put out.
1312360	1317200	So the rest is gravy, I guess Bobby Blackwell says, don't you dare delay
1317200	1319520	a Nintendo direct one minute longer.
1319920	1327640	I'm glad someone went against the grain here fifth dream says, I'd be mad.
1327640	1329520	My job is tenuous right now.
1329520	1332720	Ironically, I will have it probably until COVID is over.
1332720	1333720	So I need them now.
1333720	1337960	So I can buy PlayStation five before my job poofs, LOL.
1337960	1343460	So maybe one of those, like it actually works out in my budget and everybody's financial
1343460	1348360	situation is different, but it works better for me to budget the money to get it now,
1348400	1351600	as opposed to budgeting the money to get it later, which isn't one you hear often.
1351600	1355400	But again, your financial situation, not mine, everybody's is different.
1355400	1360680	So anyway, thank you for indulging me there with the question there, because I'm just
1360680	1364320	kind of curious, I'm kind of curious if that would be, you know, our listener is one subset
1364320	1365320	of gamers.
1365320	1369420	I'm kind of curious what the general reaction on Twitter would be if that that and social
1369420	1373320	media, I mean, Twitter to represent all social media with the representation would be if
1373320	1377520	they announced that because I feel like there are a lot of people that would be like, oh,
1377520	1378520	this sucks.
1378520	1383440	But at the same time, I also kind of feel like that might be the easy comment to make.
1383440	1389440	But there would be a lot of people that would just be like, yeah, tell me something else.
1389440	1390440	Right.
1390440	1395760	Hell, we already if I did slip my mind while I was going over this, but we've already had
1395760	1400520	one console slip their launch into 2021 and television amico.
1400520	1408740	I realize that probably isn't on people's radar in the same way that PS5 and Xbox Series
1408740	1412640	X are, but some people are looking forward to that.
1412640	1414560	It's a different audience.
1414560	1415920	And that slipped to next year.
1415920	1420840	And I think, you know, I'm somebody that preordered an Intellivision and I was also one of the
1420840	1423860	people that went, eh, am I surprised?
1423860	1424860	Not really.
1424860	1427400	Sad, but understandable.
1427400	1428400	And that's that.
1428400	1429400	So.
1429400	1430400	All right.
1430400	1431400	Anyhow.
1431400	1432400	Um.
1432400	1433400	Let's see.
1433400	1437840	DJ Rama says not to sound like a downer, but let me be real with you, 2020 kind of broke
1437840	1438840	me mentally.
1438840	1442400	So if the next gen consoles were canceled, I'd be a bit upset about it only because I
1442400	1446320	understand why that bit would have been me really wanting it.
1446320	1447720	No, I totally get it.
1447720	1449280	I totally get it.
1449280	1455720	And I'm sorry to hear about that, but I mean, like the good news for this earth and I hope
1455720	1459400	this doesn't sound like I'm trying to lessen what you said because I'm absolutely not doing
1459400	1460400	that.
1460400	1467080	But a lot of us are feeling like what else is going to happen in 2020.
1467080	1471120	So vent, my friend, because you are in good company.
1471120	1473920	I guess that's kind of my point.
1473920	1474920	Anyhow.
1474920	1478680	Bobby Blackwell says the Commodore 64 releases in November.
1478680	1480920	The full sized version of that releases in November.
1480920	1483280	That's your new console for 2020.
1483280	1487360	And Pod Culture says, I wish Amazon would restock the TurboGrafx-16 mini.
1487360	1488960	I didn't realize that was running low.
1488960	1492600	I mean, that's just because I got one early, but.
1492600	1499120	So one funny thing, though, like I recently picked up a Nest Mini because Nintendo selling
1499120	1502320	the refurbished ones for less than what they were retailing for before.
1502320	1506240	So you don't have to buy them at scalper prices and they're in stock.
1506240	1507240	Hmm.
1507240	1509320	OK, that's good.
1509320	1510320	We don't like scalpers.
1510320	1511320	$49.99.
1511320	1512320	All right.
1512360	1513360	All right.
1513360	1516480	Well, I think that's all I'll say about Gamescom for now.
1516480	1520120	It was, you know, it's nice to get some updates and especially, you know, even if the big
1520120	1524420	players weren't there, there's a lot of other companies that make games work.
1524420	1526400	So it was cool to get some updates from them.
1526400	1527400	So.
1527400	1528400	All right.
1528400	1531720	Let's move on to our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing
1531720	1532720	this week.
1532720	1535640	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1535640	1537000	A little bit uneventful.
1537000	1541360	I was playing Animal Crossing and wordscapes.
1542000	1546840	Wordscapes is I actually because I believe it or not, I beat the other word game that
1546840	1549840	I was playing.
1549840	1554240	All fifteen hundred levels of it.
1554240	1556920	So wordscapes is a little bit harder.
1556920	1559720	It's got a bigger dictionary to it, so I'm enjoying it a bit more.
1559720	1562240	I'm also playing words with friends.
1562240	1566560	I really have just been I have so much going on because I had a doctor's visit and I had
1566560	1570480	to get my eyes checked and I had so much going on this last week.
1570480	1572880	Also next week is my anniversary.
1572880	1576720	So Dan and I have been married for 15 years.
1576720	1584240	So we're probably going to, you know, just stay and play classic games all day and eat
1584240	1585240	sushi.
1585240	1586240	We'll see.
1586240	1587240	Well, congratulations on that landmark.
1587240	1588240	It's a big number.
1588240	1589240	Thank you.
1589240	1590240	We were supposed to be in New Orleans.
1590240	1591240	I know.
1591240	1592240	Oops.
1592240	1593240	But 2020.
1593240	1594240	Yeah.
1594240	1595240	Yeah, whatever.
1595240	1596240	Whoopty shit.
1596240	1597240	2020.
1597240	1598240	All right.
1598240	1601520	Well, that's it for your gaming week.
1601520	1602520	Let's talk to Loki.
1602520	1603520	How was your gaming week?
1603520	1606680	So my gaming week was pretty uneventful.
1606680	1611520	I played a few things, a little bit of Animal Crossing because of the live stream.
1611520	1619920	I played a little bit of Zelda Breath of the Wild because my son kept wanting me to help
1619920	1624200	him with different things.
1624200	1629800	And the rest was just kind of messing around with game dev stuff, not really getting very
1629800	1630800	far.
1630800	1631800	Yeah.
1631800	1632800	I saw that little screenshot on your Twitter.
1632800	1633800	What was that all about?
1633800	1634800	Yeah.
1634800	1635800	That was just without context.
1635800	1636800	Sorry.
1636800	1637800	Okay.
1637800	1638800	All right.
1638800	1639800	It's going to be like that.
1639800	1640800	All right.
1640800	1641800	All right.
1641800	1642800	Let me talk about my gaming week.
1642800	1643800	So I've been playing a lot of the same old stuff.
1643800	1644800	Final Fantasy 14.
1644800	1646720	Y'all saw the Animal Crossing thing earlier this week.
1646720	1649960	I've also been playing Pokemon Go, but I'll talk a little more about that with one of
1649960	1652640	our news items coming up later.
1652640	1654360	And I played some other stuff too.
1654360	1661720	So speaking of Pokemon, I actually, since I still use the Poke Ball Plus and with Pokemon
1661720	1665360	Shield, Sword and Shield of course, but I have Shield.
1665360	1670160	So with Pokemon Shield, you can transfer a Pokemon into the ball, although you're not
1670160	1673240	really like, you're not losing it from your party or anything.
1673240	1676680	You put a Pokemon in your Poke Ball Plus and then you can go out and catch Pokemon with
1676680	1679560	it and you get rewards in the main game.
1679560	1683720	Well, I had put some Pokemon in there like a month ago and I'd been playing Pokemon Go
1683720	1688760	like Go Fest, Community Day, all this stuff.
1688760	1692880	And I finally synced my Pokemon back over to Pokemon Shield.
1692880	1698360	Apparently I had collected about 10,000 Pokemon in the time.
1698360	1703600	That's how long it had been since I had loaded the, whoops, loaded the file back over.
1703600	1708120	So when it gave me rewards, it gave me 97 rare candy.
1708120	1713560	If you don't know what a rare candy does, you instantly gain one level on your Pokemon.
1713560	1719660	So if you're catching Pokemon at level 60, you give it 39 candy and it's level 99.
1719660	1722200	You know, so it's like, that was a lot of rare candy.
1722200	1724080	I got 97 rare candies.
1724080	1728760	So anyway, long story short, I decided maybe I need to like pick up Pokemon Shield again
1728760	1730520	because I beat the game.
1730520	1734680	I beat it when it came out, which, you know, again, I'd never beaten a mainline Pokemon
1734680	1735680	game before.
1736680	1741760	But I didn't get through the post game because every Pokemon game has the, after you become
1741760	1745760	the champion and beat the Elite Four or whatever the game's equivalent is, now you have to
1745760	1748140	go catch the legendary from the box art.
1748140	1749400	And so that's what I did.
1749400	1754720	And earlier today, or maybe it was yet, no, it was earlier today, I beat the end game
1754720	1757600	component of Pokemon Shield and caught my Zamzata.
1757600	1759200	So hooray.
1759200	1760200	So I did that.
1760200	1763880	So now I'm ready maybe for the DLC, but I kind of need to flesh out my Pokedex still,
1763880	1764880	I think.
1764880	1768760	But that was fun to revisit Pokemon Shield because I hadn't played it in literally months.
1768760	1771720	It's still a great Pokemon game.
1771720	1776440	And then another new game, let's shift gears a little bit here because this is a big change.
1776440	1782080	So I picked this one up on a PlayStation sale and it was one of those games that I've heard
1782080	1783080	a lot about.
1783080	1787080	And I think from some of you guys in chat have actually been kind of nudging me towards
1787080	1788080	this game.
1788080	1793840	So I picked up a game on the recent PlayStation sale called Telling Lies is the name of the
1793840	1794840	game.
1794840	1802560	So Telling Lies is from the same creators and like creative minds behind Her Story,
1802560	1806280	which was out like three or four years ago.
1806280	1810040	And a lot of the game is based in full motion video.
1810040	1817400	In fact, I almost feel a little weird calling this a game at the end of the day.
1817400	1818400	It's a game.
1818400	1819400	Don't get me wrong.
1819400	1826000	You know, because some people try to dismiss walking simulators, something like Dearest.
1826000	1827000	Was that like a Dearest?
1827000	1829560	Was that the game that yeah.
1829560	1831160	Some people try to write that off.
1831160	1832440	What was it?
1832440	1833440	Something about the rapture.
1833440	1834440	Yeah.
1834440	1835440	Oh, everybody's gone to the rapture.
1835440	1836440	Yeah.
1836440	1837440	Yeah.
1837440	1839960	Some people try to write off those walking simulators as not games.
1839960	1840960	They're games.
1840960	1842480	Those are beautiful.
1842480	1849880	But I would say that Telling Lies was a little more adjacent to like the Bandersnatch episode
1849880	1858000	of Black Mirror on Netflix and that kind of game where it's not so much like push X as
1858000	1864840	fast as you can or solve this puzzle, but it's kind of like a different way of exploring
1864840	1866640	a story.
1866640	1868880	And I really enjoyed it.
1868880	1872240	I really enjoyed it.
1872240	1874920	But the biggest like.
1874920	1877360	So let me talk about the strings, because there's a lot of strings.
1877360	1880200	I want to if I want to get in the negative, I'm going to make it sound like, oh, my God,
1880200	1881200	I'm slamming on this game.
1881200	1882200	I'm really not.
1882200	1886280	The positives are the acting performances in this game are really good.
1886280	1890300	There's four main characters in the game.
1890300	1892760	There's one man and three women.
1892760	1895240	And one of the women looked really familiar to me.
1895240	1899240	I think she's Storm now in the X-Men series.
1899240	1906520	He's in this and the guy didn't look familiar to me at all, but he is really good in this
1906520	1907520	game.
1907520	1910860	And in fact, all the all the acting is is really top notch, because what's interesting,
1910860	1915760	this game probably could have been made in the 90s when full motion video games like
1915760	1918000	Night Trap were getting started.
1918000	1925200	But like the production value and the acting and a lot of those early games were not great.
1925200	1926440	Right.
1926440	1933320	But now in this like this is like you're watching a Netflix show, but you're also like participating
1933320	1934320	in.
1934320	1935320	So here's the mechanic.
1935320	1940720	Basically, you're playing like a character that is watching surveillance footage and
1940720	1946680	you're going through surveillance footage and the game starts so that the very first
1946680	1949360	thing you search for is the word love.
1949360	1954720	So you will get the first five video clips because search limits are maxed at five that
1954720	1960480	have the word love in them and you watch the clip and then maybe the character will
1960480	1963560	say something and you're like, I want to know more about that.
1963560	1964560	Maybe.
1964560	1967900	OK, so this character just mentioned somebody named Ava.
1967900	1968900	Who's Ava?
1968900	1970120	I'm going to search for Ava.
1970120	1975080	Now I'll get five conversations where Ava is mentioned first word chronologically.
1975080	1977080	And that is basically the game.
1977080	1982300	You're choosing a path based on what you want to hear more about.
1982300	1988040	And it gets very clever because there are lots of different things you could be exploring.
1988040	1991140	There are several storylines embedded in the game.
1991140	1998540	And it's actually just what it must have taken to write a game like this is really brilliant.
1998540	2002300	And so I absolutely think it's something worth your time.
2002300	2004600	Jamie, I think you'd like this.
2004600	2008460	I don't know why, but I just think like this is the type of thing I think maybe because
2008460	2015540	it is just so much like a narrative and so like story driven where you're not like, there's
2015540	2018820	not like a lot of pressure on you to do like, I just feel like it's something you might
2018820	2019820	really enjoy to.
2019820	2024420	So I'll be sure to check it out, just link me so I don't forget.
2024420	2025420	Yeah, no worries.
2025420	2029860	So I'm curious if any of you in chat have played it telling lies.
2029860	2035980	OK, so let me tell you the one negative I have, because it is something that is presented
2035980	2037540	on the PlayStation four.
2037540	2039360	This game is also out on PC.
2039360	2040820	It was out there first.
2040820	2045500	And those computing platforms, I believe it's on mobile phone, iOS, Android.
2045500	2047320	It was there last year as well.
2047320	2052460	It just came out for PS4, Switch, maybe Xbox, probably Xbox.
2052460	2053460	It just came out.
2053460	2054460	I think I'm going to be getting it on Steam.
2054460	2059040	Yeah, it just came out on all of that a couple like weeks ago.
2059040	2061460	So or no, it's actually a couple of months ago.
2061460	2068220	Anyway, my biggest problem was my game brain took over.
2068220	2074660	And my game brain said, there's a clock up here and this clock is advancing.
2074660	2075660	It's getting later.
2075660	2079900	I only have so much time to get through all this stuff.
2079900	2086780	So I was too tempted to fast forward clips and not really watch them and just scan for
2086780	2089120	the language in the clips.
2089120	2094660	And I think I robbed myself of an experience by doing that.
2094660	2099400	So I want to make, I'm going to tell you one kind of spoilery thing, but I'm telling you
2099400	2100400	this.
2100400	2104080	I'm going to intentionally say this because trust me, this is something you're going to
2104080	2105880	want to know.
2105880	2108720	You can't lose the game.
2108720	2109720	That's the spoiler.
2109720	2111380	You can't lose.
2111380	2116040	Now that you know that, you cannot make the same mistake I did and turn your game brain
2116040	2118980	off and enjoy the story for what it is.
2118980	2122420	And I think you'll have a better experience.
2122420	2128420	So that's my one criticism with as brilliant as this game is, I wish it almost hadn't been
2128420	2133820	presented like the game it was because it made me think I got to get through this faster.
2133820	2135780	It's going to be game over.
2135780	2138220	And that's totally not the case with this at all.
2138220	2141100	So, all right.
2141100	2147900	Let's see comments and chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
2147900	2153940	Hi, Stella, Chad starts in chat talking about walking Sims.
2153940	2156340	I don't think I've played a walking Sim that hasn't been fantastic.
2156340	2157340	No, true.
2157340	2158900	Like they're all really good.
2158900	2165460	Fifth dream says, is this the game with Angeles seraphian and I hope I said the right in it.
2165460	2166820	I admit I bought the game just for her.
2166820	2167820	I'm sorry.
2167820	2169120	I don't know who their names.
2169120	2171900	I don't know the actors and actresses names, but they are really good.
2171900	2172900	Chad is confirming.
2172900	2173900	Yes.
2173900	2174900	Fifth dream says yes.
2174900	2176660	It's a bit crazy, but it's a cool concept.
2176660	2177660	She hope says yes.
2178420	2179420	And I like it so far.
2179420	2180420	And Bobby black of confirming.
2180420	2181420	Yes.
2181420	2182420	It's on Xbox one.
2182420	2183940	So anyway, that was my experience with telling lies.
2183940	2185740	I really liked it.
2185740	2197500	I just, I think the story is so smart in this context that they had to think of all these
2197500	2199900	different ways that you could navigate it.
2199900	2202340	I just it's, it's really impressive anyway.
2202340	2204900	So I give a big thumbs up to telling lies.
2205140	2209300	I'm curious to see what else we get that might be like this.
2209300	2214900	Not that I want every game to copy this format, but I love the idea of, so, so I mentioned
2214900	2217320	like, okay, it's not like a game.
2217320	2221900	Like you might think most games are with like action elements and push X to not die and
2221900	2222900	things like that.
2222900	2227280	Like it isn't a game like that, but we've had these things lately, like the band or
2227280	2231000	snatch episode of, uh, uh, black mirror.
2231000	2232000	We've had this now.
2232000	2233940	And of course her story before that.
2233980	2239860	And we've had other things that are more like, it's almost like it's less of a game and more
2239860	2248460	of a interactive storytelling, a new medium to tell using gamification to tell store,
2248460	2249460	tell your story.
2249460	2251100	I'd say that's what it really is.
2251100	2254340	It's gamification to tell a story.
2254340	2255900	And I think it's really neat.
2255900	2261460	And I'm, I'm so curious to see what else comes of it because yeah, I loved telling lies.
2261460	2262940	So there you go.
2262940	2267340	Buzz Buster says technology is finally caught up with what CD-ROMs attempted to do in the
2267340	2268340	nineties.
2268340	2269340	Right?
2269340	2272740	Honestly, there's no reason this game could not have existed in the late nineties except
2272740	2279700	for, I think they say there's like, they shot hundreds of hours of footage for the game
2279700	2282680	and there's, I think at least 10 hours in it.
2282680	2286620	And that would be the one thing that would prevent it from existing in 1990 is storage
2286620	2287700	mediums.
2287700	2291520	You wouldn't let CD-ROMs could hold how much, how much video could a CD-ROM hold?
2291520	2293640	Like 34 minutes, something like that.
2293640	2295040	It wasn't a lot.
2295040	2298000	So that's, that's the one thing.
2298000	2300400	So, all right.
2300400	2301600	Anyhow, that's my gaming week.
2301600	2302600	Sorry.
2302600	2304400	I talked a lot about that game, but that happens sometimes.
2304400	2305600	All right.
2305600	2306920	Let's get into some other news.
2306920	2309780	Oh wait, before we do that, let me do some quick housekeeping actually.
2309780	2313320	So we will not be here live next week.
2313320	2316800	We will not be here live with Orange El Dorado next week because it is Labor Day.
2316800	2319660	Well, it's also, it's also Labor Day weekend.
2319660	2322620	We haven't done a show over Labor Day weekend for the past eight years.
2322620	2324620	Normally that's because I'm not here.
2324620	2326580	I'm at Dragon Con.
2326580	2328980	And that's only partially true this year.
2328980	2332580	Obviously with the pandemic, I'm not flying out to Atlanta to go to Dragon Con in person
2332580	2334820	because they're not having Dragon Con in person this year.
2334820	2336340	They're having it virtually.
2336340	2339300	So I'm going to be participating with the virtual Dragon Con event.
2339300	2343300	And I want to invite you guys to participate along because you can actually, you don't
2343300	2347260	have to have a ticket to do a lot of the Dragon Con stuff this year.
2347260	2352740	They actually are running three different feeds on, the official con is hosting feeds
2352740	2358280	on Vimeo or I think there's an app available on Roku if you use that.
2358280	2362900	And you can watch several different Dragon Con dedicated channels all weekend.
2362900	2364840	And that's pretty cool.
2364840	2366700	But also some of the different fan tracks.
2366700	2371300	So what makes Dragon Con unique is that it's like, it's almost like 20 different fan conventions
2371300	2374220	happening all at once.
2374220	2376440	And that's what makes it really cool.
2376440	2380620	So one of the tracks that I've participated with for years and years, back since it was
2380620	2385080	called the podcasting track, is the digital media track because now it's not just podcasting
2385080	2389680	but Twitch, YouTube, and all the other ways that people create content.
2389680	2392920	They're going to be streaming their panels all weekend long on Twitch.
2392920	2395040	It's going to be virtual panels.
2395040	2399500	So you'll want to check out DC Digital Media on Twitch.
2399500	2402940	Or we'll be hosting it here at VOG Network, of course.
2402940	2406340	So you can just come to the usual place and you'll see it there too.
2406340	2410860	I'm going to be participating in three different panels over the weekend.
2410860	2415960	Friday at 7 Pacific, 10 Eastern, I'm going to be on a panel about networking and building
2415960	2419040	a podcast network and why should you join a podcast network?
2419040	2421460	Or why might you not want to join a podcast network?
2421460	2422460	Because there's some cons as well.
2422460	2425080	So we're going to talk a little bit about that and some things I've learned from my
2425080	2429000	different experience of the three different networks I've been with over the years.
2429000	2433860	So we'll talk about that at 7 Pacific, 10 Eastern on Friday.
2433860	2437700	On September 5th, video didn't kill the radio star.
2437700	2445820	Bobby Black Wolf, myself, I believe we got Rochelle from formerly of Electric Sisterhood,
2445820	2448900	but now the show Black Compat is going to be joining us.
2448900	2453520	This is great because usually we don't get her at Dragon Con, but thanks to everything
2453520	2455260	being virtual, she's going to join us for this.
2455260	2456800	I'm really excited about that.
2456800	2462400	And I believe Bill Run, Jump, Stomp is going to be joining us for that panel as well.
2462400	2465060	And I hope I'm not forgetting anyone, Bobby, I think it's just the four of us, but I might
2465060	2467580	be leaving somebody out unintentionally.
2467580	2472860	But we are going to be talking about taking your podcast in an audio format and taking
2472860	2475860	it to video, which is something we all have experience doing.
2475860	2479460	So we're going to talk a little bit about that and very excited for that panel.
2479460	2483920	We did it last year and it was, we were kind of surprised at how many people showed up.
2483920	2485140	So it was really cool.
2485140	2488600	So we're going to do it again this year in a virtual format, so that's really exciting.
2488600	2492420	So stay tuned for that on September 5th.
2492420	2498760	And then September 6th at Sunday at 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern, I'm going to be
2498760	2502160	doing a panel called Educating and Entertaining Online.
2502160	2510280	And it's basically a panel of educators and talking about making that conversion to online
2510280	2512620	in this whole pandemic.
2512620	2515640	Teachers really went through it.
2515640	2520160	And a lot of us though, were able to use some of our knowledge we've gotten from broadcasting
2520160	2521160	to be able to kind of help that.
2521160	2523480	So we're going to talk a little bit about that.
2523480	2525440	It might be like, Rob, why are you on that panel?
2525440	2529420	Believe it or not, my day job, I'm not a high school teacher or an elementary school teacher.
2529420	2530720	Other people on the panel are.
2530720	2536200	I create training in a corporate environment is the short story of what I do that actually
2536200	2537380	pays my bills.
2537380	2541840	So I do have experience in teaching of a different sort in a corporate environment.
2541840	2544020	So I'll be lending that perspective to the panel.
2544020	2547420	So that is all on Sunday, 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern.
2547420	2548860	And that is all, of course, on Twitch.
2548860	2552800	So we will not be here with Orange Lounge Radio while Virtual Dragon Con is going on.
2552800	2553800	And it's just a long weekend.
2553800	2559440	And we imagine many of you are going to be doing things, although of course, don't forget,
2559440	2560560	there's a pandemic going on.
2560560	2564800	So if you are out doing things, wear the mask, social distance, y'all know the drill.
2564800	2569940	But I imagine there's still a lot of people that are going to go to a beach or go camping
2569940	2573780	or do some of the outdoorsy things that have become very popular this year in light of
2573780	2574780	the pandemic.
2574780	2576980	So have fun, but be safe, of course.
2576980	2579200	So all right.
2579200	2580700	That's it for my gaming week.
2580700	2585200	So let's move on and get into some gaming news for tonight.
2585200	2587940	So Loki, why don't you start us off?
2587940	2588940	All right.
2588940	2595180	So let's talk about more, more wrap ups of different digital events.
2595180	2601740	So Nintendo did another one of their directs with our direct mini, I should say, that was
2601740	2604920	covering our partners or their partner showcase.
2604920	2606880	So it's all the third party games.
2606880	2610900	So some of the stuff they showed off their Kingdom Hearts, Melody of Memory, which is
2610900	2618380	coming November 13th, they're going to have an eight player free for all local co-op mode,
2618380	2620320	which is kind of cool.
2620320	2625420	They showed off some new tracks and artists for Fuser, which is pretty exciting.
2625420	2627420	I can't wait to play that.
2627420	2634360	Taeko no Tatujin, Rhythmic Adventure 1 and Rhythmic Adventure 2 coming this winter as
2634360	2636280	a combo pack.
2636280	2641860	Apparently World of Tanks Blitz is coming to the Switch as well, or is on the Switch
2641860	2644040	now.
2644040	2648620	They have a collection of the saga, Final Fantasy Legend.
2648620	2653540	It's going to be bringing Game Boy classic versions of those.
2653540	2657260	I guess it's December, Just Dance 2021.
2657260	2661500	And this is the first version that is not going to be on the Wii.
2661500	2666920	So that was a long run, but that trend is over, unfortunately.
2666920	2669680	So now it's on the Switch.
2669680	2675660	That's coming out November 12th, Puyo Tetris II is going to be expanding with some new
2675660	2678380	modes in December 8th.
2678380	2682860	That's kind of a surprise.
2682860	2688260	I'm kind of surprised Puyo Tetris is, I'll go back through some of these when you finish
2688260	2689260	the recap.
2689260	2690260	Sorry.
2690260	2695300	Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Editions coming, or already came out, I guess.
2695300	2697300	So that was earlier this week.
2697300	2702660	And then they talked a little bit about the Minecraft Dungeons Winter DLC, which is coming
2702660	2703660	next month.
2703660	2711700	Yeah, and it's more expansions for other games like Captain Tsubasa and Jump Force Luxe Edition.
2711700	2713700	Gotcha.
2713700	2717660	So focusing on a couple of those announcements, well, there was a lot of music game announcements.
2717660	2719660	Did you notice that?
2719660	2723860	Obviously as a longtime music game fan, I was like, wow, there's like all these music
2723860	2725380	games showing up.
2725380	2731220	The Kingdom Hearts, Melody of Memory, which essentially is Kingdom Hearts' theater rhythm.
2731260	2734220	I'm not sure how I feel about that game.
2734220	2739580	I want to get it because I love theater rhythm, but I'm worried it's going to be like, did
2739580	2740580	they tell us the price?
2740580	2742580	They didn't tell us the price, did they?
2742580	2747180	I'm worried it's going to be too much money and the music isn't going to be worth it.
2747180	2750700	I'm not sure the Kingdom Hearts franchise has music.
2750700	2755980	Yes, there are some songs, I know everybody's going to say, but what about Utada and that
2755980	2756980	stuff?
2756980	2760380	Yeah, there's some great songs, but I just don't know if there's a whole game's worth.
2760420	2767220	There were all the songs from the Under the Sea level from the Little Mermaid stuff.
2767220	2769620	We had to sing all the songs with it.
2769620	2774020	There were all, I mean, the soundtracks for them actually were really amazing.
2774020	2778020	I would anticipate that just about any of those levels that had special music for them
2778020	2781620	would have been incorporated quite a bit.
2781620	2786620	And Let It Go was in the trailer, so I'm sure there's a strong Disney present.
2786860	2790860	Yes, I wince too, but that indicates there is a strong Disney presence.
2790860	2793860	That's not necessarily what I'm referring to as well.
2793860	2798860	I mean, the music in the game itself is fairly memorable.
2798860	2802860	If Amazon is to be believed, it's $60.
2802860	2804860	See, that might be a bit high for me.
2804860	2805860	I might wait for a sale.
2805860	2806860	We'll see.
2806860	2810860	I'll wait and see what the reaction is when the game comes out.
2810860	2813860	But I am a little more excited about Fusor.
2814100	2817100	I did like Drop Mix, so that was cool to see.
2817100	2820100	And I thought the Taiko game looked really cute too.
2820100	2823100	And I think that game already exists in Japan, if I'm not mistaken.
2823100	2828100	So it's kind of cool that we're getting it packaged as a combo here, getting to check that out.
2828100	2829100	So that's cool.
2829100	2833100	And then of course Just Dance, you know, it's kind of a standard at this point.
2833100	2838100	But that was four music game updates in a Nintendo Direct, so that was pretty cool.
2838100	2842100	Then I was talking about Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 coming out of nowhere.
2842340	2849340	That really surprised me because I kind of thought that conversation with Tetris had shifted to Tetris Effect, obviously.
2849340	2852340	And then on the Nintendo side, Tetris 99.
2852340	2857340	And I kind of thought Puyo Puyo Tetris would be a one-off.
2857340	2859340	And that's not me saying anything negative.
2859340	2860340	I enjoyed it.
2860340	2861340	I thought it was fun.
2861340	2864340	I'm just surprised that they felt the need to do a sequel.
2864340	2868340	But maybe the first one sold much better than expected.
2868340	2870340	How many different systems was it on?
2870340	2871340	It was on quite a few.
2871580	2872580	It was.
2872580	2873580	It wasn't quite a few.
2873580	2878580	Now, of course, I kind of giggle when they talk about, oh, the story.
2878580	2879580	There's an all-new story.
2879580	2880580	I'm like, what story?
2880580	2882580	They don't play those games for the story.
2882580	2883580	But okay.
2883580	2885580	But I think it's cool.
2885580	2887580	And Dark Soccer, you're a fan of that game, too.
2887580	2891580	So is the news of a sequel kind of surprised you, or are you pumped for that?
2893580	2896580	I'm vaguely indifferent about it right now.
2896820	2900820	Just because I'm actually kind of going back to playing a few different puzzle games as
2900820	2904820	much as I love Puyo Puyo, I did not really enjoy it combined with Tetris.
2904820	2905820	Fair enough.
2905820	2909820	If I'm going to play Puyo Puyo, it's going to be Puyo Puyo.
2909820	2913820	Bobby Blackwolf is confirming that this new game will be multi-platform as well.
2913820	2914820	So cool.
2914820	2915820	All right.
2915820	2919820	Well, let's move on and talk a little bit about some changes to Pokemon Go.
2919820	2924820	Pokemon Go, of course, is a game that I spent a little bit of my spare time playing.
2924820	2925820	And I know a lot of you do as well.
2926060	2930060	And Pokemon Go finally brought Mega Evolutions to the game this week.
2930060	2934060	I say finally, but I mean, when the game first launched, I would have never expected that
2934060	2935060	these would make their way into the game.
2935060	2937060	But they are here now.
2937060	2942060	They've launched Mega Evolutions of Venusaur, Charizard, there's two, X and Y, Blastoise,
2942060	2943060	and Beedrill.
2943060	2946060	There's a quest line in the game that will get you the energy to do Beedrill.
2946060	2951060	And then you can Mega Evolve the others by doing a lot of raids.
2951060	2954060	They introduced this currency called Mega Energy into the game.
2954300	2957300	And you get Mega Energy when you do raids.
2957300	2962300	But long story short, I don't think the raids are worth the bang for the buck.
2962300	2967300	You have to do like at least, like you have to be good and do four of these raids.
2967300	2972300	You're probably going to have to do more of like five or six Venusaur raids, just that,
2972300	2978300	to get enough energy to Mega Evolve Venusaur one time for four hours.
2978300	2982300	After that, the cost of it will go down to Mega Evolve it.
2982540	2986540	It's still kind of like one of those, what's the reason to do it besides a short little
2986540	2990540	boost in gym battles and to be a completionist in the Pokédex?
2990540	2996540	And I think the prospect four years into the game to catch a Venusaur, which is an evolution
2996540	3001540	of one of the first Pokémon that was in the game, like six times from a raid.
3001540	3003540	I just don't see the incentive there.
3003540	3007540	So Niantic needs to rework this system.
3007540	3013780	Now the good news is a lot of people have expressed their concerns, to put it that way.
3013780	3015780	And Niantic has responded.
3015780	3019780	They responded on Reddit and they wrote a tweet that's basically like, we hear your
3019780	3023780	concerns about Mega Evolutions and we're looking into what we can do.
3023780	3025780	So that doesn't mean it's going to change tomorrow.
3025780	3029780	But it's nice to hear that they recognize there's an issue and they need to look at
3029780	3030780	it.
3031020	3039020	Me personally, I would fix it by not having Mega Energy be per species.
3039020	3040020	That is silly.
3040020	3043020	Just have it be out of one bank, Mega Energy.
3043020	3046020	And you should be able to get Mega Energy from other things as well.
3046020	3051020	You should be able to get Mega Energy from doing quests, Mega Energy from hatching eggs,
3051020	3055020	and doing other things besides just the raiding.
3055020	3060020	I think even if it's just a little bit, I think it would make it a little more exciting.
3060020	3063260	And so that's, yeah, that's my concern with the Mega Raid.
3063260	3068260	ActDeftInChat says, Megas are here and most people are not liking it with good reason.
3068260	3071260	Yeah, four at the minimum, but most likely it'll be at least five.
3071260	3074260	My gripe with this is, what are Megas good for right now?
3074260	3075260	They're almost useless.
3075260	3077260	That's another good point.
3077260	3080260	You transform them for four hours.
3080260	3085260	I did do a Mega Raid where somebody brought, we were fighting a Venusaur, so somebody brought
3085260	3088260	a boosted or Mega Charizard into the fight.
3088500	3094500	And what happens is that the Charizard, just being there, boosts everybody's fire attacks.
3094500	3099500	So it makes it that you need less people to get it down or you get it down faster.
3099500	3101500	So that is the perk at the end of the day.
3101500	3106500	And I imagine for those that really like to solo raids, it'll probably make getting some
3106500	3111500	of those three stars a lot more solo-able if you use them.
3111740	3117740	Shane in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says, I cannot get into the way they've done
3117740	3118740	mega evolution.
3118740	3123740	I've kind of stopped playing the game because it just sits so wrong with me.
3123740	3127740	I don't know if I would write off the whole game because of it, because like, for example,
3127740	3129740	I don't care for the battle league.
3129740	3131740	I want nothing to do with it.
3131740	3136740	I don't like that there's rewards tied to it, but I just don't play it.
3136740	3140740	The one nice thing about Go is that there's a lot of other things you can do.
3140740	3142740	You can still go out and catch Pokemon.
3142740	3143740	You can look for shinies.
3143740	3144740	You can hatch eggs.
3144740	3146740	You can try to take gyms.
3146740	3147740	You can explore new gyms.
3147740	3152740	I still feel like there's a lot of other stuff to do in the game, but I think the weekly events
3152740	3156740	that they were doing, like the Enigma week and the Unova week and some of that stuff,
3156740	3159740	that stuff was way more exciting than mega evolutions have been.
3159740	3165740	So hopefully Niantic takes a chance to re-examine this whole thing because I'm not super into it.
3165740	3168740	But at least there's other stuff that makes it interesting.
3168740	3170740	There is that.
3170740	3171740	All right.
3171740	3172740	Well, let's move on.
3172740	3176740	We're going to go to our next story from DarkSakura, and you guys will have to excuse me.
3176740	3179740	I'm going to step away for just a moment.
3179740	3181740	So other stuff then.
3181740	3189740	Well, this one, I'll admit, I've got some cautious hopefulness about this one.
3189740	3193740	And honestly, I wouldn't have really given this a lot of attention if it wasn't for Shane,
3193740	3196740	who is in our chat right now.
3196740	3202740	And that's about another Kickstarter for and I'm going to mispronounce this IUDIN Chronicles.
3202740	3206740	And actually, after watching the trailer, it actually sounds.
3206740	3207740	Yeah, you didn't.
3207740	3208740	Thank you.
3208740	3212740	It actually sounds like it's going to be a pretty neat game here.
3212740	3218740	I mean, to the point that I'm actually considering putting some money down on it myself.
3218740	3221740	It's a JRPG.
3221740	3229740	It's it actually hit its initial funding of fifty thousand dollars by for Rabbit and Bear Studios.
3229740	3232740	They've added a bunch of stretch goals on it.
3232740	3239740	And it's going to have basically a lot of characters, very like Suikoden.
3239740	3247740	And it looks like the they've got involved in this is Murayama Yoshitaka.
3247740	3253740	There are 2D characters combined with 3D environments, very similar to Octopath Traveler,
3253740	3263740	but it is now number three in the biggest video game kickstarters in history.
3263740	3269740	So the only two that have topped it by number two is Shenmue three.
3269740	3272740	Number three was Bloodstained Ritual of the Night.
3272740	3281740	And I have to say, I'm looking at it with with some hope, so I'm considering putting some down on it as well.
3281740	3286740	Maybe I'm not going to go for all the crazy stretch goals, but who knows?
3286740	3288740	I think that. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
3288740	3296740	I just had an FYI in the chat by by Shane here saying, yeah, the closing stream was great and the guests were awesome.
3296740	3301740	Plus Akira Yamaoka was there and you could never go wrong with him.
3301740	3308740	Agreed, agreed. And who knows? I mean, maybe we'll we'll have some of his music in there, which definitely mean I would have to have this.
3308740	3315740	So, yeah, I mean, four point five million over that amount in crowdfunding.
3315740	3320740	That's pretty, pretty amazing. A lot of people are excited about it.
3320740	3326740	So we'll see how it how it comes. I'm actually fairly, fairly hopeful.
3326740	3329740	Yeah, it looks pretty good. I guess it ended yesterday.
3329740	3337740	So did it. Well, but it looks it looks pretty cool, like definitely getting the.
3337740	3345740	Yeah, I mean, the art style is pretty awesome, so I do see the comparison between this and Octopath Traveler,
3345740	3350740	especially just like the traversal of like the town stuff looks very much like Octopath,
3350740	3355740	although the battle system is completely different and a lot more cinematic.
3355740	3362740	I do like I do like the character designs. I mean, there's definitely some cosplay able people in there.
3362740	3371740	So, yeah, I'm very interested to see what this looks like once it comes out, but I'm not going to be for a while.
3371740	3375740	It's not supposed to go out until October twenty twenty two.
3375740	3382740	So it is what it is. I will probably have forgotten about this game by the time it actually makes its way out.
3382740	3386740	Don't worry. Shane will remind you. I'm sure he will.
3386740	3392740	I'm back and I will be reminding you because I actually backed the project.
3392740	3398740	So I just I did it at a very small level where I'm just getting the digital game, but I'm into it enough to want to play it.
3398740	3404740	So there's a little bit more to they because of the funding,
3404740	3412740	they will have localization for Korean, Brazilian, Portuguese and Russian languages.
3412740	3419740	So nice. Hey, more people that get to play it then. Did you guys read any of the chat comments I was out?
3419740	3422740	Well, yeah, most of them were Shane. OK, yeah.
3422740	3425740	That's why I just want to make sure because, you know, he has something to say about it.
3425740	3432740	So I just want to make sure they are read. But yeah, he follows it so closely that I know there's a lot of good updates to pretty much.
3432740	3437740	It was because of him that I had this update. Yeah, I don't even read the emails that the campaign sends.
3437740	3442740	I'm just like, oh, Shane will tell me about it when we play 14 tonight.
3442740	3446740	So, yeah, he mentions in chat, though, he just posted this.
3446740	3450740	So I know you didn't get to this one yet. The vampire vote didn't go his way.
3450740	3455740	I wanted the David Bowie one and he lost by just a handful of votes. I kind of wanted the David Bowie one, too.
3455740	3460740	So and I didn't vote. So I'm part of the problem. When you don't vote, you don't get what you want.
3460740	3465740	Remember that? Yeah. So this is why we get vampires that don't look like David Bowie.
3465740	3470740	Well, this is why we get a lot of problems. But anyway, yes, this this this being a non serious one.
3470740	3475740	Yes. Shane is also pointing out there's a also a side game coming out for it.
3475740	3479740	It's a farming style game that will come out before the main game comes out.
3479740	3483740	That's kind of funny, too. I just thought it was something they were building into the main game.
3483740	3489740	But it's kind of like how bloodstained Curse of the Moon had that whole like eight bit game that preceded it.
3489740	3496740	They ended up getting the sequel. And then now we've got like a farming game instead of like an eight bit RPG or something.
3496740	3503740	I thought that's kind of cool. It's pretty neat. Yeah. Anyway, I'm looking forward to playing the finished game in what, like three years?
3503740	3510740	No, I think they're saying twenty twenty two. So it'll be a little while. All right. Meanwhile, Loki, what do you got for us?
3510740	3516740	All right. So let's see. Let's talk a little bit about Halo.
3516740	3522740	And so. As you may remember, the last time they showed off Halo Infinite,
3522740	3538740	there was some people that didn't necessarily like the way it looked and thought that it might be not really fulfilling the promises that Microsoft had made about like a next gen Halo game.
3538740	3543740	And so because of that, of course, Halo Infinite's been pushed back to twenty twenty one.
3543740	3555740	And to help hopefully get Halo back on track, they've added some Halo veterans to the development of the game to be able to get that where it needs to be.
3555740	3567740	So apparently one of the main writers of the early Halo games at Bungie was working on a different project that now has been brought to be a leader of the game as well.
3567740	3574740	And that's Joseph Stanton. So hopefully with good writing, you know, that will help.
3574740	3584740	But more of the visuals, I think, that we noticed. I mean, I don't know what the quality of the writing was in Halo Infinite, but I know the visuals are a little bit rough.
3584740	3590740	We would know like we've only seen like a little bit of it. So that's another concern about the game.
3590740	3597740	I again, I kind of think the conversation on visuals was overblown. I understand some of the concerns people have and so forth.
3597740	3604740	I still thought it looked fine, but I get that there was pop in and, you know, the other things that other people have already pointed out.
3604740	3609740	Not necessarily that it was just like it wasn't very detailed, but like I get it. Art styles are one thing and stuff.
3609740	3613740	But as long as the game plays well, I guess it doesn't really matter.
3613740	3622740	But right. I mean, I don't know, like sometimes especially like if they're planning to do like a battle royale type mode with this,
3622740	3629740	they may have simplified the graphics a bit because you're going to have, you know, maybe 100 or so players on the field at one time.
3629740	3636740	And so maybe that was the reasoning behind it. But sometimes you would think with campaign you would maybe up that a little bit.
3636740	3639740	I don't know. That could be a possibility.
3640740	3647740	They're only pushing it back to early 2021, right? They didn't push it all the way back to holiday 2021, right?
3647740	3652740	So my mind is kind of like, what all can they really fix with only that much time?
3652740	3658740	Yes, maybe some graphical fidelity and things like that. Trying to get a little more oomph out of it. Fine. Turning up the graphics on level three.
3658740	3670740	Yeah. But the writing, if that that means the voiceovers, that means the animations that go with that. That's that's a concern.
3670740	3682740	Well, here's the thing, too, like here. So like I know like Bungie or it's not even Bungie anymore, but like, you know, the folks behind the Halo series have made some pretty great games.
3682740	3693740	But that being said, the folks behind Mass Effect made some pretty great games. And then Anthem comes out and it was kind of like, not great.
3693740	3700740	And Andromeda had some serious issues, too. Yes. Yeah. So like all great companies can fall.
3700740	3711740	And so I kind of am a little worried. And that's why we just this day and age, even like, you know, Square Enix and Eidos or whatever, putting out different games like, you know, the upcoming Avengers game.
3711740	3720740	Originally on paper, it sounds great. But then you see like the end product and it's like it just gets marred by like executive decisions and stuff.
3720740	3729740	And so we just have to wait and see. We had to play it cautiously, especially if we're dropping, you know, allegedly almost a thousand dollars on these systems.
3729740	3734740	We just have to play it cautiously of these games coming out. So I'm going to wait and see.
3735740	3742740	Well, it's funny you should bring all that up. So on a similar note, moving to our next story, you brought up Square Enix in that.
3742740	3750740	And of course, Square Enix just released this week a pretty highly anticipated remaster of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.
3750740	3760740	Well, it's not being very well received by critics. And if social media is any indication, fans are feeling some sort of way about it as well.
3760740	3766740	And a lot of the problems just have to do with it sounds like some of the choices they made for online play.
3766740	3776740	This game really kind of shits the bed when it comes to online play. Basically, that that you're unlocking things in other people's dungeon.
3776740	3788740	So whoever's dungeon you're doing, you're unlocking stuff in their dungeon. But yet, as I understand it, certain story flags may still get set off in your own story.
3788740	3798740	So if you do a certain dungeon with a friend, you might set off something in your own story that basically ruins a major plot point in the game for you before you've even begun to really play the game.
3798740	3805740	So it sounds like just the whole online situation is not good. And you have to use friend codes and all this stuff.
3805740	3817740	Which is interesting because I was like, why are they still hooked on friend codes? And then I remembered, didn't they first try to reboot Crystal Chronicles on the Wii and it never happened?
3817740	3822740	And now all this time later, we're getting it finally on the Switch.
3822740	3827740	I thought they did like a Wii and DS version of Crystal Chronicles or was that the original Crystal Chronicles?
3827740	3830740	The original was Game Boy Advance and GameCube.
3830740	3837740	So no, they did. They did a maybe I'm thinking of Chocobo Mystery Dungeon or something like that.
3837740	3842740	They were supposed to do Crystal Chronicles on Wii and they never did.
3842740	3847740	And so this thing has kind of been worked on ever since then. It sounds like it's not.
3847740	3853740	It just sounds like for the amount of time we've been waiting for this, it didn't deliver.
3853740	3857740	And that's very disappointing, to put it lightly. Now, again, I'm going off hearsay.
3858740	3868740	So if you've been playing the game and you've been loving it and you want to say something nice about it, by all means, please speak up in our chat room or send us an email over at participate at orange lounge radio dot com.
3868740	3874740	It's just all the reaction I've been seeing is that it's it's not doing very well.
3874740	3878740	Or well, I don't know. I don't know about sales, but I mean, it's just not being received very well.
3878740	3882740	The critic scores certainly are indicating that. That's for sure.
3882740	3889740	Now, it should be said, though, on the plus side, it does have a pretty robust light edition demo.
3889740	3893740	And that's pretty cool and something we didn't have really before. So there is that.
3893740	3897740	So you want to you want to say yay to some things that worked right.
3897740	3903740	So Shane in chat says, if you're going to give it a shot, do not play it on mobile.
3903740	3909740	I tried that last night. Yeah, I remember hearing the controls were really difficult on mobile,
3909740	3917740	which is almost always the case when a game that was built with a game pad in mind transitions to mobile.
3917740	3925740	That transition is very often not great. Games that are designed for mobile do very well on mobile,
3925740	3930740	but games that are not that are kind of shoehorned into mobile don't always go so smoothly.
3930740	3934740	So anyway, maybe this one of those things I'll pick up when there's a sale.
3934740	3939740	But I was I was I was really bummed out to hear, like, a lot of the crap this game's getting.
3939740	3948740	It's that's a bummer. Anyway, Act Deft in chat says, confirms there wasn't a Crystal Chronicles for Wii nor later.
3948740	3952740	Chocobo Mystery Dungeon was what you might have been thinking about on the Wii.
3952740	3958740	I swear I could probably find it, too, because I have crap that goes all the way back to E3 2006.
3958740	3963740	I almost feel like it was in one of the early teasers for the Wii in 2006 was Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.
3963740	3969740	And they just they didn't get around to it. So, you know, they did have a game, though.
3969740	3975740	It was Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, the Crystal Bears. Mm hmm.
3975740	3980740	I think you're right with that spin off game. Yeah.
3980740	3984740	And Shane says there was one about a king on the Wii. Right. Yeah.
3984740	3989740	I think it was that whole thing. So. All right. Anyway, let's move on.
3989740	3992740	We have more stories to get to in our classic game of the week is just ahead.
3992740	4000740	But first, Dark Sakura. Well, there has been, of course, a very.
4000740	4010740	So what I'm thinking of charged air in regards to anything having to do with civil unrest.
4010740	4020740	And Ubisoft has actually promised to pull an image that was used in one of their Tom Clancy games that was accused of promoting.
4020740	4026740	All right. Black Lives Matter conspiracy theories. They used the raised fist image.
4026740	4036740	You know, the. Image in, I guess, people on the podcast and see it, but the raised fist image in their intro video for elite squad,
4036740	4043740	which is sort of an all star action RPG on their mobile devices, kind of Fortnite style.
4043740	4049740	It was developed by Alliant, which is a Paris based studio. They normally do horse breeding games.
4049740	4055740	But the intro shows a civil unrest with a group called Umbra, quote,
4055740	4061740	a faceless organization that wants to build a new world order that is a terrorist organization.
4061740	4067740	And they were using that symbol as.
4067740	4074740	As I guess their their symbol, which, of course, is completely tone deaf.
4074740	4083740	Number one and really is sending the wrong message for the use of that symbol for for gamers everywhere.
4083740	4088740	It really is insensitive and it's very good that they took it down.
4088740	4097740	And for the for those who are in chat, I will gladly post the image so that people can see what the one in question is.
4097740	4101740	But yeah, it's it's it's ridiculously insensitive.
4101740	4106740	And they need they need to if they haven't pulled it down already, it needs to be down now.
4106740	4116740	So there was actually a comment and actually I think some of this is already linked on our discord over at Vogue Network dot com slash discord.
4116740	4119740	You can join our discord server and chat with us throughout the week.
4119740	4126740	And Dungeon Buster in Discord actually linked to a tweet that was written by Brendan Gibbons.
4126740	4130740	And Brendan Gibbons is a game and narrative designer for hire.
4130740	4137740	So I believe Brendan worked on this title and wrote this tweet that said, angry about the use of the black power fist here.
4137740	4147740	I worked on the character bios and was informed that Umbra is supposed to be a James Bond villain organization, not something that looks like.
4147740	4154740	Yeah, not something that looks like what the Q conspiracy people think is happening. Irresponsibly bad optics.
4154740	4159740	That tweet is very thank you for sharing that on our discord, Dungeon Buster, because that tweet is very interesting.
4159740	4166740	When you hear one of the assumed writers again, I'm sorry, I don't have all the details on what this gentleman did for the game, what they contributed.
4166740	4175740	But to hear that, like they thought they were doing one thing and what translated into the visuals wasn't a match.
4175740	4181740	Like that's that's really crazy to hear, because when I looked at the video and I'm trying to look at the video,
4181740	4183740	like that's kind of the first time I saw it was that tweet and everything.
4183740	4188740	And I'm looking at the video and I'm going, this doesn't look like a James Bond organization at all.
4188740	4192740	And when I looked at the video, I'm like, yeah, it this is bad optics.
4192740	4198740	This does look a little too close to stuff that's going on in the real world.
4198740	4204740	So it's yeah, it was yikes anyway.
4204740	4214740	Let's see, Act F says a co-host and I were talking about this on GFM cast and he explained to me that the rioters shown in the game are controlled by a terrorist group.
4214740	4216740	But yeah, it doesn't excuse them from doing that.
4216740	4222740	You know, still, this is a trailer that promotes your game and think about what you know, what what are you really promoting in that?
4222740	4230740	So, yikes. Anyway, I'm glad they're at least going to fix it, for what it's worth.
4230740	4233740	All right, moving on, Loki.
4233740	4238740	Yes. So let's talk a little bit about mods and console mods.
4238740	4242740	So there are some pretty cool portable Wii mods this week.
4242740	4253740	So one of those being from Jinger of Mods, who basically fit a Wii system into the size of like almost like our original Game Boy Color.
4254740	4266740	And so, yeah, it's pretty cool using basically they have to hack up the original Wii motherboard and cut off a bunch of the circuits from that.
4266740	4279740	And then it's also using a 240P display and parts from the DS and also from a Switch controller and even a GameCube controller.
4279740	4284740	So very convoluted, but it is pretty cool the results from that.
4284740	4290740	However, though, if you're looking for to do this yourself and you want to spend the money to do that, you have a spare Wii and all the other stuff.
4290740	4299740	You can actually go to there's a website store that bitbuilt.net and they have something called the G-Boy.
4301740	4308740	G-Boy and it's a DIY portable kit, so it'll save you the time of having developed your own shell and everything for that.
4308740	4314740	So it comes with the case, the display and some of the other charging circuitry as well.
4314740	4322740	You'll just need to supply the battery, micro SD card, D-pads and ABXY buttons, which are found on a DS.
4322740	4326740	And of course, you know, the Wii console itself.
4326740	4328740	But then they have the instructions on how to build it.
4328740	4332740	And I actually watched one of the YouTubers, I watched my tech tips.
4332740	4336740	They actually built one and it looks definitely advanced.
4336740	4343740	There's lots of soldering, obviously, and you have to also be very careful with cutting that circuit board, the main motherboard of the Wii.
4343740	4350740	But the results look pretty cool. Like if I had the time and skills, I would love to build one.
4350740	4358740	Yeah, it looks pretty neat from what I was seeing, too, is that, yeah, it's a pretty slick looking thing, but definitely not something I would want to attempt on my own.
4359740	4363740	Yeah, so but yeah, if you're interested, like I said, check out that Bitbuilt website.
4363740	4370740	They've got a lot of stuff that you can, I think we even have other portable kits as well. So check it out.
4370740	4379740	All right. Well, let's move on to talk about this old rumor is back, upgrades for the Nintendo Switch in 2021.
4379740	4387740	So we've had this rumor circulating a couple of times now that Nintendo plans to do like a Switch Pro or some type of upgraded Switch model.
4387740	4390740	So, you know, why are we talking about it again?
4390740	4402740	Well, this time the rumor is coming from Bloomberg, which is more of an investor type of publication and not somebody's like game blog or social media or what have you.
4402740	4409740	So that's why this one is gaining a little more traction around the Internet than the others, because it's coming from more the investor side of things.
4409740	4420740	So Bloomberg did say in a recent report that the successor basically to the Nintendo Switch, the next Switch, we obviously don't have a name for it, is due in 2021.
4420740	4427740	It is called a upgraded model of its Switch console. So it's not supposed to be something where like it'll be a whole new system.
4427740	4438740	It's just some type of like Switch upgrade. Also saying that Nintendo has looked into including more computing power and 4K high definition graphics.
4438740	4451740	That takes a lot of people by surprise to hear 4K graphics because Nintendo, Nintendo kind of tends to show up later to the graphics and all that stuff party.
4451740	4457740	So to hear that Nintendo's thinking about 4K already seems to be a little bit surprising.
4457740	4464740	Of course, we have no idea if this means, does that mean 4K portable or just 4K when it's docked?
4464740	4468740	I would imagine docked.
4468740	4477740	Yeah, I would imagine docked only as well, but we don't know. Like that's just, you know, our logical brains trying to tell us what we think is going to happen.
4477740	4481740	But we don't know until Nintendo actually announces.
4481740	4488740	There was a similar story as well in a Taiwan economic magazine, Taiwan Economic Daily News.
4488740	4491740	So yeah, that's that's where they're at.
4491740	4500740	It was pointed out that the time between the 3DS and the 3DS or the new 3DS was a similar timeframe.
4500740	4504740	So this getting an upgrade would not be completely surprising.
4504740	4507740	And I think some of us are kind of expecting it anyway.
4507740	4511740	I just hope it doesn't kind of like splinter the Switch's base too much.
4511740	4517740	I think the biggest problem with the new 3DS is that I was never really convinced I needed one.
4517740	4522740	Yeah, there wasn't really a good reason for it. There's a handful of games that needed it.
4522740	4524740	Two or three games that needed it.
4524740	4531740	And the Super Nintendo, which I remember I threw a fit about because I'm like, why can't the frickin...
4531740	4535740	But anyway, that's old frickin' news at this point.
4535740	4541740	But I'm very curious, like what is really going to justify this new Switch?
4541740	4544740	And I hope it doesn't splinter things up too much.
4544740	4549740	But if it's one of those things where it's like, OK, docked, it will do 4K on Mario.
4549740	4556740	But if you have an old Switch, then it just kind of plays in 1080 instead or whatever, 720 even.
4556740	4560740	Like an old Switch, then I don't think that might be too big a deal, but we'll see.
4560740	4564740	I mean, I have no idea what Nintendo has in store because, again, this is all a rumor.
4564740	4566740	It's a little bit of a surprise there.
4566740	4572740	Sjo and Hunter Matt says Bloomberg cited sources from within Nintendo that gave this info.
4573740	4578740	I would imagine if Bloomberg is citing sources, they must be more reliable than your standard Reddit user post.
4578740	4579740	Very good.
4579740	4582740	ActDef says, I need a performance mode for the Switch.
4582740	4585740	I want my Overwatch at 60 frames a second.
4585740	4589740	That's a good call. That's something that perhaps a pro Switch could do.
4589740	4593740	And of course, Overwatch 2 is something that's on the horizon eventually, right?
4593740	4595740	Maybe in a similar timeframe. Who knows?
4596740	4605740	Shane points out in chat or Chad Starzik says, the best things about the new 3DS were the nub stick and the head tracking for 3D.
4605740	4607740	Yes, those were very impressive features.
4607740	4613740	And when I finally did get around to buying one, when they put out that Metroid one that I really wanted, I liked those features too.
4613740	4620740	But I'm not even sure it was worth it if you already owned a 3DS to get just that.
4620740	4623740	But they were, I mean, it was a nice upgrade. I'm not going to lie either.
4624740	4626740	Tigerclaw in chat says, here's the thing.
4626740	4632740	If you get this new Switch, you're going to have to re-buy all the games you purchased digitally.
4632740	4634740	Really good call out from Tigerclaw.
4634740	4641740	If there is not an easy way to transfer digital licenses, I might be very hesitant to buy one.
4641740	4643740	Don't they have that already?
4643740	4655740	I thought they had that already. I thought they brought that into play when they had, they just put out the Switch Lite or whatever, the Switch.
4655740	4659740	Yes, you're right. The Switch Lite. Jamie?
4659740	4660740	Switch Lite.
4660740	4663740	Well, aren't your purchases also tied to your Nintendo account?
4664740	4673740	They are. And I was going to point out that we need to remember with the 3DS, since we brought that up, the 3DS, the new 3DS.
4673740	4681740	I remember transferring my ambassador license. You remember that? For the really early 3DS adopters?
4681740	4690740	I transferred that twice because I moved it from my original 3DS to my Zelda 3DS. I moved it from my Zelda 3DS to my Microsoft one.
4690740	4692740	So you were able to move digital things.
4692740	4693740	I had a Microsoft one.
4693740	4696740	I'm sorry, Metroid one. What is wrong with my brain today?
4696740	4704740	So, I actually know I had a migraine most of the day, but anyway. So, moving it to the Metroid one.
4704740	4710740	So, you were able to move those digital licenses. You could do it between Wii and Wii U as well.
4710740	4716740	Yeah, but your licenses should follow your, my Nintendo account.
4716740	4718740	No, they absolutely should.
4718740	4721740	And I think that's what they do for the Switch.
4721740	4731740	Yeah. And DJ Roma S says, ambassadors account. Yeah, that's because, do you remember when the 3DS first came out?
4731740	4737740	I don't remember what the problem was. If it wasn't selling well, I don't think they had a lot of great software.
4737740	4743740	But anyway, they ended up doing this thing where they were like, if you buy a 3DS, you're going to be an ambassador.
4743740	4751740	And you get like, it was like 10 Game Boy Advance games for Virtual Console and like 10 Game Boys.
4751740	4757740	So, you got all these like classic from the Nintendo library games that only the ambassadors ever got.
4757740	4760740	Like, there was a WarioWare in there, I think.
4760740	4770740	Well, here's what's confusing me about what you're saying is that you're having a new system shouldn't matter about your, the games that you own.
4770740	4779740	The system, the licenses shouldn't be tied to the system, they're tied to your ID so you can have another ID with the game, another system with your ID on it.
4779740	4788740	You're right, it shouldn't. But I do know when I did those other processes, it wasn't as simple as connecting to the store and redownloading everything with my login.
4788740	4793740	It didn't work that way. You actually had to copy everything from the old system.
4793740	4797740	And it would move everything off of the old system completely and on the new system.
4797740	4807740	And I think it's one of those things about Nintendo that really ticks people off about the way they do some of the online stuff is that like the license is kind of like your ID, and your console.
4807740	4817740	So, I got very silly. Yeah, so I agree and I think it's one of the things that Nintendo ought to address if they are going to convince people to upgrade to a Switch Pro.
4817740	4820740	So, yeah.
4820740	4827740	I mean, at least they have certain things like cloud saving for Animal Crossing and whatnot that you can at least keep your games going over.
4827740	4831740	Now, they do, but that wasn't even there when it was first.
4831740	4835740	So they already said that was going to be available, they just had to incorporate it into the game.
4836740	4838740	Yeah. No, true, true.
4838740	4850740	All right. Well, let's travel back to a more classic time. Let's go back to an era before there was cloud saves and before we had all these different pro consoles and so forth.
4850740	4853740	It's the classic game of the week.
4853740	4861740	And every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault to find a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be checking this game out.
4861740	4869740	And wow, Jamie, yet again, we have a pick here where I'm like, we're on episode 834 of this program.
4869740	4875740	You've been doing this segment since episode 250 because there were some prior things.
4875740	4880740	There used to be like website of the week where there's some other things before we kind of landed on this, which is a great fit.
4880740	4891740	And I'm stunned sometimes at some of the games that I see, like you'll send me your pick and I'm like, how have we not done that in like 600 episodes?
4891740	4892740	How?
4892740	4894740	I have that thought myself.
4894740	4895740	I know, I know. It's crazy.
4895740	4900740	And tonight is definitely one of those nights where I'm like, how has this never been a classic game?
4900740	4905740	But that's not a negative. It just means we cover so much good stuff here, right?
4905740	4906740	Right.
4906740	4915740	We have a ton that we've done, and I'm a little bit disappointed in myself for not having done this earlier, but better late than never.
4915740	4917740	You've done some other games.
4917740	4918740	I've done others in the series.
4918740	4921740	Yes, you definitely have, but just never this one.
4921740	4922740	And that just surprised me.
4922740	4924740	But that's OK. We're going to fix that tonight, right?
4924740	4925740	C'est la vie.
4925740	4927740	What is it?
4927740	4931740	The game of the week is Street Fighter II The World Warrior.
4931740	4935740	Of course, many of us have just known it as Street Fighter II.
4935740	4938740	It is a fighting game developed by Capcom.
4938740	4943740	It was originally released in arcades in 1991, and it is the second in the series.
4943740	4950740	The very first being Street Fighter that came out in 1987 that was not as happy about it.
4950740	4958740	It was the 14th title to use the CP system arcade board, and it improved so much over the first game,
4958740	4968740	including the special command moves, six button configuration and adding better, more interesting characters with their own fighting style and a combo system.
4968740	4973740	So this actually became the best selling title of it.
4973740	4987740	I mean, probably since the golden age, 1994, the game had been played by over 25 million people in the US alone at home and in arcades.
4987740	4991740	There have been updated versions since then, different variants on it.
4991740	5000740	Because remember, before we had that Valve couldn't count to three, before it was Capcom couldn't count to three.
5000740	5008740	So going into the game, basically you have your different fighters.
5008740	5015740	We had, you know, just a few coming over from the original Street Fighter.
5015740	5028740	And so your goal is to deplete the vitality bar of the other player by getting hits on them until they have no vitality left.
5028740	5039740	If you do it at the same time, or you have an equal amount of life at the end of the match, then you get a double KO or a draw.
5039740	5043740	You can get, you know, additional rounds if you have tied too many times.
5043740	5056740	So, you know, so at any rate, if you could actually make a match last up to 10 rounds, if there was no clear winner, but when Champion Edition came out, it was reduced to four.
5056740	5069740	And if there's no clear winner by the end of the final round, then the computer opponent, if you're playing versus the computer, will win by default, or both will lose in the two-player match.
5069740	5075740	So after every third match in single-player mode, you will have a bonus stage.
5075740	5077740	Oh my car!
5077740	5081740	Which was originally, oh my god, but they changed it, of course, in the US.
5081740	5096740	The bonus round will have, in order, a car-breaking event that's very similar to the bonus rounds in Final Fight, the barrel-breaking bonus game, which I kind of hated, and then the drum-breaking bonus game, which I hated even more.
5096740	5098740	I like beating up the car.
5098740	5108740	Between the matches, you have a Pacific-centered world map that shows you where each of the home stages are, so you are traveling the world.
5109740	5114740	You have an eight-directional joystick and six attack buttons.
5114740	5136740	I don't really need to go into explanation on actually how it plays, but to go through the original characters, you had Mew, you had Ken, you had Edmund Honda, you had Guile, or people who couldn't pronounce Guile called him Wheely, which was stupid, and those people made me cry.
5137740	5140740	Yeah, I hate, I'm like, can you not read?
5140740	5148740	Anyway, there was Chun-Li, there was Blanca, Zangief, and Dalsim.
5148740	5155740	And you had your CPU-exclusive characters, and I will be going by the Japanese names.
5155740	5162740	You had Balrog, who in the US was Vega, a Spanish bullfighter.
5162740	5169740	You had M. Bison after Mike Tyson, who was called, they switched him to Balrog in the US.
5169740	5180740	You had Sagat, who is the Muay Thai fighter, and then Vega in Japan was called M. Bison here, which, meh.
5180740	5193740	And so, of course, there was all kinds of just craziness that came out of this, different rumors and things, things that even made it into magazines as April Fool's jokes.
5193740	5195740	I actually still have an issue with EGM somewhere.
5195740	5205740	One of Ryu's quotes was, you must defeat Shenlong to stand a chance, which was supposed to be translated, you can't win if you can't beat my Dragon Punch.
5206740	5218740	But they thought there was a character named Shenlong in the game, and this led to a big hoax, and EGM played on it, and then there are two characters at the intro who were named Scott Max.
5218740	5227740	So, at any rate, you know, they've gone and the game really spawned stories and all kinds of crazy stuff.
5227740	5237740	But the fun thing about this combo system, because this was one of the earliest games to actually have a combo system, and so many people worked on it,
5237740	5248740	and the original developers didn't really prioritize the balance of the game, and they really put more of its properties and how animated it was,
5248740	5262740	and how they could make it look, and how the characters would be able to, the characters actually took up different size, like Ryu was an 8 megabit and Zangief was 12 megabit, and the game took two years to develop.
5262740	5274740	But about the car stage, and this is a quote from Hunamizu Noritaka, who said that they saw the punch timing and it was possible to add a second hit and so on,
5274740	5279740	so they made, from a little bug maybe, they added in that combo system.
5279740	5290740	And of course, most of the music was composed by Shinomura Yoko, and she actually left Capcom for Square two years later.
5290740	5299740	But I mean, of course, we know she's done a lot of great work for Capcom in the past.
5299740	5312740	I mean, just different things that she's worked on, you know, Final Fight, Gargoyle's Quest, you know, she's worked on popin' music, probably.
5312740	5313740	Oh wow.
5313740	5320740	Yeah, you know, but we've also had her for Nemo, just all kinds of games, she's done some really great stuff.
5321740	5328740	And as I recall, she did, I think, my favorite music in Kingdom Hearts.
5328740	5332740	I believe that she did the Tron music.
5332740	5334740	She actually did a lot of music in Kingdom Hearts.
5334740	5335740	Oh wow.
5335740	5336740	Kingdom Hearts 2, sorry.
5336740	5347740	So as far as different ports out of this game, and I'm not talking about, like, the various special editions and whatnot, championship edition, you name it.
5347740	5358740	There was the Super Famicom version that was re-released for Wii and Wii U Virtual Console, that was in 1992.
5358740	5372740	Also in 1992, we had Amiga, Atari ST, those came on floppy disk, Commodore 64 Rob on cassette or floppy disk, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, PC-DOS on three disks, ooh.
5373740	5386740	In 1994, there was the CPS Changer, there was 1995 on Game Boy, 1997 Sega Master System, 98 Sega Saturn and PlayStation, with the Saturn version being greater, because it had 2D better.
5386740	5401740	2004, it came out on mobile, 2005, PlayStation 2, Xbox, PSP, 28, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Windows, as part of the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection.
5401740	5406740	The Super Nintendo One had some big changes made to it with its release.
5406740	5423740	They removed the attract sequence, some of the voice samples had to be reduced, you could not necessarily get a lot out of the character vocalizations, but depending on their strength level, they went higher in pitch.
5423740	5425740	I don't know if you ever knew that.
5426740	5441740	The tunes in the soundtrack were also rearranged, and there were just some different attacks that were removed, like Chun-Li's standing medium punch.
5442740	5448740	Two of the elephants from the Balsim stage, so yeah, it was really downscaled quite a bit, but it was still a really good game.
5448740	5455740	And this, you know, the arcade version of this game got some amazing ratings from it.
5455740	5464740	It was, you know, it was probably one of the higher ranked games that released at this time.
5464740	5469740	Of course, we're popular worldwide, and now we're up to like freaking Street Fighter V.
5469740	5491740	But for our different versions of Street Fighter II that were released, we had Street Fighter II The World Warrior, we had Special Champion Edition, Street Fighter II Turbo, Street Fighter II The New Challengers, and then there was Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix, Ultra Street Fighter II, we've just had so many.
5491740	5496740	And like I said, the joke was, can a Capcom count to three? Oh, no.
5496740	5501740	But I mean, it also has had such a big impact on just pop culture in general.
5501740	5513740	The game has been sampled so many times for its music, even Nicki Minaj sampled, or actually referenced the game, will be a bunch of different folks.
5513740	5518740	Yeah, Nicki Minaj's single was called Chun-Li, so that was a good song.
5518740	5531740	You know, but who sampled list 80 songs that have sampled Street Fighter II, including Kanye, Jay-Z, Drake, all kinds of folks.
5531740	5537740	And then there's also a British Grindel band called Hadoken.
5537740	5546740	And I mean, it's just like I'm even just looking at the references page for all this, and it's almost as long as the article itself.
5546740	5559740	It was such a huge piece of pop culture. Like, you know, you and I are a similar age, and I just remember how much this game dominated, you know, the early high school slash like late junior high kind of years.
5559740	5565740	Like this was in every arcade. It was, you know, it was just like the game.
5565740	5573740	And, you know, when it came out for Super Nintendo, because it came out there first before Genesis, it was a huge deal.
5573740	5579740	Like it was a huge deal when this came out on Super Nintendo. Everybody was looking forward to it.
5579740	5588740	It sold, I'm sure, Cuckoo Bananas crazy. They ended up doing Super Street Fighter, Turbo Street Fighter, all in the Super Nintendo as well.
5588740	5591740	So, so well done.
5591740	5604740	Well, and the other the other things about it apart from other things that it spawned is there have been different, I would probably say different other expansions to it.
5604740	5613740	And in fact, the Street Fighter 2 characters became part of the G.I. Joe A Real American Hero line in 1993 because Hasbro bought the rights to the characters.
5613740	5623740	There was an unofficial South Korean animation called Street Fighter that had the Street Fighter 2 and then there was a movie in Hong Kong called Future Cops.
5623740	5631740	That was another, you know, rename of that. There were other adaptions for film, there was Street Fighter 2 the animated movie.
5631740	5641740	There was the live action one with Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue and Raul Julia, which I happen to have seen four times in the theater because of reasons.
5641740	5655740	And then there was also the US Street Fighter cartoon, which was terrible. Street Fighter 2V, the prequel series that was sort of, I guess, not quite Street Fighter Alpha.
5655740	5666740	There was actually there was for for Street Fighter 4, there was even an animation that came out with that game.
5666740	5673740	And then, of course, who can forget the Street Fighter sequence in City Cop? Was it City Cop? Yeah.
5673740	5677740	Am I right? The Jackie Chan movie?
5677740	5678740	City Hunter.
5678740	5684740	City Hunter, because I was thinking of the anime and for the life of me, I could not remember the name of it because I've watched a bunch of City Hunter.
5684740	5692740	Yes, the anime was awesome. And then, of course, the live action movie is also awesome. And that Street Fighter sequence is really great.
5692740	5699740	That sequence is like the memorable thing. And seeing, you know, Jackie Chan as Chun-Li was absolutely hilarious.
5699740	5709740	But yeah, you know, this this game has been embedded into our pop culture. Even if you're not a gamer, you know what the hell Street Fighter 2 is.
5709740	5723740	So, I mean, and thankfully it's not the old whack-a-mole, they opted not to use the whack-a-mole style, you know, game that the original Street Fighter was for a bit. So there you go.
5725740	5732740	Let me ask you this crazy question. You know, this obviously was a game that came after, you know, it's Street Fighter 2 for a reason.
5732740	5737740	There was a Street Fighter 1 that I don't think was quite ingrained into popular culture.
5737740	5744740	And what's interesting is that Street Fighter 2 barely references the original Street Fighter. Like you said early on, most of the characters aren't here.
5744740	5747740	You know, characters like Birdie and stuff, they're never...
5747740	5749740	But they came back for Street Fighter Alpha.
5749740	5751740	What's that? Oh yeah, they came later.
5751740	5764740	Yeah, like Gen and all of those. But they were really expanded upon. You know, I think that they had to step away from how the initial game went.
5764740	5772740	And like I said, that whack-a-mole thing was stupid, okay? I mean, I get the concept behind it, it's novel, but that's no way to play a game.
5772740	5780740	And it's gonna, you know, basically mean that arcade owners are gonna have to replace their machines or their buttons and keep doing all kinds of other maintenance on it.
5780740	5790740	But in the long run though, when going to a full joystick and button style, that's better for arcade operators, especially since it's using a particular system.
5790740	5799740	You know, and then even with the later ones going into the CPS2 system, you have your ROM cartridges that you can replace and keep using that same system for multiple games.
5799740	5803740	So it really was an innovation just in terms of gaming itself.
5805740	5813740	Yeah, and I think also just like, I think what it brought to the arcades, the player versus player element, that I think a lot of games...
5813740	5819740	I mean, certainly that existed in other games, but like that was the core of this game.
5819740	5831740	And I think there was something about that that really lended itself to the popularity of this game and really paved the way for so many games that either tried to copy it or just were inspired by it.
5831740	5835740	I would say Mortal Kombat being the most obvious example. Obviously, Mortal Kombat is its own thing.
5835740	5839740	I'm not saying that it's trying to bite off of Street Fighter, but it wouldn't exist if it weren't for Street Fighter.
5841740	5842740	Exactly.
5842740	5848740	Yeah, so, all right. Well, there it is, your classic game of the week. It's one of those, it's about time type of selections.
5848740	5854740	But you know what? No, I mean, like I said earlier, we just sometimes we're highlighting so many other games.
5854740	5861740	So many games have been made over the years. We finally got around to Street Fighter 2 tonight. Great pick. Appreciate that.
5861740	5865740	All right, let's move on. We've got some more news to get into.
5865740	5871740	And then we're going to take some comments from our chat room as we get to the listener roundtable a little later in the show.
5871740	5876740	But let's get to some rapid fire news and talk about some other things that are going on in the industry right now.
5877740	5884740	Yeah, so let's talk about some of the games that are going to be coming to PlayStation Plus next month, or I should even say in a couple days.
5884740	5892740	So, speaking of Street Fighter, we're going to be getting Street Fighter 5, which is going to be arriving tomorrow on September 1st.
5892740	5899740	And also PUBG is going to be the other free game as well. So, pretty cool.
5899740	5908740	And then also there is some updates regarding Marvel Avengers, and I can't say that they're good updates.
5908740	5913740	It's talking about their battle pass system and cosmetics and all that stuff.
5913740	5924740	So, like a lot of the popular games nowadays, they're doing this kind of like season pass type of, well, not necessarily season pass.
5924740	5938740	I guess sort of like the skill tree that you would see in like Fortnite or in Fall Guys, for example, where you have to unlock things in order to unlock each of the cosmetics in there.
5938740	5947740	Well, to be able to do that, you have to purchase a challenge, a hero challenge card, which is going to be 1000 credits or $10.
5947740	5951740	And that's per hero that you want to unlock that stuff.
5951740	5964740	Now, they say that at the end of it, though, you do earn your 1000 credits back, but that's after you grind through everything in order to unlock all of that, which I'm guessing is probably going to be quite a slog.
5964740	5976740	Aside from that, they're going to also have, of course, the credit packs that they're selling, that they're going to be selling different items that are going to rotate on a weekly basis.
5976740	5988740	I don't know. I don't need when you have like a huge article in this, this is even coming from Square Enix discussing how the monetization is going to work.
5988740	5993740	We'll take your money here. We'll take your money there. We'll take your money anywhere we can get it.
5993740	5999740	We don't even know like how good this game is going to be. And it doesn't seem like a lot of people are very impressed with it so far.
5999740	6002740	So why are we getting into the monetization?
6002740	6013740	I mean, they did keep saying that it's optional and it's just cosmetic, but no, I'm not. This just turns me off of this game even more.
6013740	6021740	But it's a concern. We should be getting more, you know, on the great features in the game and reasons why we're going to enjoy it.
6021740	6025740	I just it seems a little tacky to be talking about. Here's how we're going to take all your money.
6025740	6030740	Like, I understand, like, and I will say I'm glad they are talking about it up front.
6030740	6036740	I'm glad they're getting ahead of because, you know, if this was all kind of exposed when the game was released.
6036740	6039740	For our benefit, they're doing it to try to save face.
6039740	6045740	Yes. Yes, exactly. Exactly. But I'm glad we're getting it now and not later, I guess, as a result.
6045740	6053740	So, all right. Other rapid fire things. Spotify is trying to amp up their e-sports offerings.
6053740	6056740	They're doing a partnership with Riot Games.
6056740	6066740	And so now Riot will be working with Spotify, I guess, exclusively when it comes to League of Legends, including a new League of Legends related podcast and e-sports.
6066740	6070740	So there's no launch date for when the podcast will kick off yet.
6070740	6073740	But it is something that they are working on for this year.
6073740	6081740	There's also going to be some type of official hub in Spotify that will have gaming music, podcasts and playlists, including the official League of Legends.
6081740	6084740	And this is League of Legends playlists. And, you know, I have to say that.
6084740	6090740	And by the way, this is nothing new for Spotify. They've been really trying to amp up the representation of podcasts on there.
6090740	6094740	You can subscribe to OLR there if you want, as well as many other great podcasts.
6094740	6102740	But they are, you know, one of the big, big shows they just got recently. Michelle Obama just launched a podcast on Spotify.
6102740	6106740	And I don't endorse celebrity podcasts very often because I'm very much.
6106740	6112740	And even when I'm reading this, I'm like, I bet there's a lot of fan run League of Legends podcasts that are worth your time.
6112740	6119740	You don't have to do the official one. But I will say, if there's any celebrity podcast I'm going to endorse, the Michelle Obama one is really good.
6119740	6125740	I mean, she's just such a good speaker anyway. Everybody was talking about her speech, you know, at the DNC and so forth.
6125740	6130740	And she's just so, so well spoken that it lends itself. It's kind of like when she had a podcast.
6130740	6134740	It's one of those things where it's like, I'm surprised it took this long.
6134740	6140740	I mean, I'm surprised we had to wait this long for this. So that was that was a great land in Spotify's world.
6140740	6146740	The one other thing I will say, though, with this whole League of Legends talk and Spotify, though, I can't believe we had that whole article.
6146740	6155740	And whole discussion and not a word about KDA, because I don't know if you all have heard that new KDA song, but it's fire.
6155740	6159740	It's fire. It's so good. There's a new one. Yeah, the baddest. Check it out.
6159740	6167740	It's it's really good. And it's that same kind of like K-pop and American pop fusion that pop stars was.
6167740	6172740	And they are going to be doing an EP at some point this year. I think they've changed some of the singers.
6172740	6177740	I think some folks were maybe brought into pop stars thinking it was just going to be a one song thing.
6177740	6183740	So they've changed the lineup a little bit. But, you know, it's like the Pussycat Dolls, right?
6183740	6187740	Yeah. At the end of the day, it was Nicole Scherringer and whoever else was there.
6187740	6193740	Right. Destiny's Child. It was. Does anyone remember when Destiny's Child was four people?
6193740	6196740	Anyway, it was Beyonce and her friends. All right.
6196740	6201740	Moving on. Let's talk about everybody. All right.
6201740	6204740	One other rapid fire thing I want to talk about. Twitch.
6204740	6209740	September is coming back. No talk about any restaurant chain partnering with this.
6209740	6214740	However, September is coming back. September 1st at 10 a.m. Eastern.
6214740	6217740	You're going to be able to get some savings on channel subscriptions.
6217740	6220740	Twenty percent off the first month of the new subscription.
6220740	6223740	Twenty five percent off a three month subscription.
6223740	6231740	Thirty percent off a six month subscription. So, you know, if you have some channels that you're wanting to support.
6231740	6234740	And you know, there's so many great content creators out there.
6234740	6241740	Like, I'd be dumb not to try to put a cheap plug for ourselves, but I'm sure there are many great content creators on Twitch that you're watching.
6241740	6244740	And September is going to be a great time to stock up on that.
6244740	6250740	If you want to do that, even though there will be a discount for you to sign up for these subs.
6250740	6253740	The streamer themselves will still get the same share of the pie.
6253740	6256740	So Twitch is absorbing that discount, which is a great thing.
6256740	6261740	They aren't trying to force their discount on the streamer like their Grubhub.
6261740	6264740	OK. Or one of those services. Anyway.
6264740	6272740	So, yes, that's pretty cool. So you can bet we're going to try to push subs come September because it'll be a little cheaper.
6272740	6276740	But please support all your favorite content creators. There's many great ones out there.
6276740	6279740	Including one that just showed up in our chat room, Black Compat.
6279740	6286740	I urge you to follow our pals formerly of Electric Sistahood on their new venture over there.
6286740	6290740	And I know there are many other folks as well that are streaming in this day and age.
6290740	6295740	DJ Rama S, I'm sure would love it if you would follow Anime Jam Session.
6295740	6299740	And we would love that, too, because they are our friends here at the Voice of the Youth Network.
6299740	6302740	So anyway, let's move on.
6302740	6305740	Other rapid fire news from Dark Sakura.
6305740	6309740	Yeah, it is very sad, but Sega has confirmed the end of Sega ages.
6309740	6314740	However, they're going to be doing more stuff for Switch and revisiting past titles.
6314740	6322740	But it was confirmed in Game Watch from Okunari Yosuke basically said that there's no future plan for.
6322740	6331740	Oh, hot dog for. Sorry, my husband brought me food for any other any other games in the future.
6331740	6335740	The last one they did was here's a spy.
6335740	6341740	But, you know, they said there's more stuff from M2 that might be out.
6341740	6346740	And then also Streets of Rage 4 is getting some new content.
6346740	6348740	But we don't know when.
6348740	6352740	The Streets of Rage 4 is getting some new content, but we don't know when.
6352740	6358740	They're not telling us. They just said, yeah, it's happening. You'll find out eventually.
6358740	6362740	Suck on it. Not really.
6362740	6364740	Look forward to it. Please look forward to it.
6364740	6370740	That marinates in Streets of Rage 4 as it is, which is like as far as like throwback titles go,
6370740	6375740	for better or for worse, Streets of Rage is a throwback title.
6375740	6382740	It's all the great things about 90s arcade beat em ups and all the things that feel a little stale about them in the year 2020 as well.
6382740	6384740	But you know what? I think it's a great throwback.
6384740	6386740	Streets of Rage was Yuzo Koshiro.
6386740	6391740	No, of course, I know. Oh, yeah. And the music's fire, of course, is one of the best reasons to check it out.
6391740	6394740	All right. Let's travel. Oh, I'm sorry.
6394740	6397740	Let's travel around the world and check out some releases coming out this week.
6397740	6400740	So we'll start in the US with Loki.
6400740	6403740	All right. So this week we've got a few things.
6403740	6412740	So starting off with R.A. and the Secret of Seasons on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6412740	6416740	Not to be confused with Ori and the whatever, whatever.
6416740	6421740	Yes. No, not to be confused with that. Crusader Kings 3 on PC, Mac and Linux.
6421740	6426740	Iron Harvest on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6426740	6435740	MX versus ATV All Out on Nintendo Switch. Spellbreak on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

6449740	6454740	Marvel's Avengers on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Stadia.
6454740	6461740	NBA 2K21 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Stadia.
6461740	6469740	Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6469740	6473740	World's End Club on iOS. That's it.
6473740	6477740	All right. Let's talk about Japan. So some of the releases in Japan this week.
6477740	6483740	Slay the Spire gets a localized release in Japan this week on September 3rd for Nintendo Switch.
6483740	6488740	And then also coming out in Japan, NBA 2K21. It's coming out there as well.
6488740	6493740	I guess it gets a world release of sorts. And Minecraft Dungeons gets a release on the Switch in Japan this week.
6493740	6499740	So they're catching up a little bit on some of the things that we've had here for a bit. So check that out.
6499740	6502740	On the PlayStation 4, we also have some releases.
6502740	6507740	We have Marvel's Avengers gets its Japanese release this week.
6508740	6513740	As well as I think that might be it actually in Japan this week.
6513740	6517740	I would have thought some of those. Oh, there it is. NBA 2K20. I was like, surely that's there.
6517740	6519740	NBA 2K21 is out in Japan this week as well.
6519740	6525740	And Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 also gets a combined release there in Japan this week.
6525740	6529740	Pretty cool. Dark Sakura, how about the UK?
6532740	6534740	Are you muted, Dark Sakura? Or am I just not here?
6534740	6539740	I am now. OK, I was. I was eating a hot dog because my husband loves me.
6539740	6543740	I understand. Yes, he feeds his wife.
6543740	6553740	So anyway, on the 31st, there's a bunch of stuff, by the way. On the 31st, we have MX vs ATV All Out.
6553740	6562740	On Switch, we have Crusader Kings 3 for PC, Marvel's Avengers Deluxe Edition, Marvel's Avengers Earth's Mightiest Edition.
6562740	6568740	And on September 2nd, we have WRC 9 on the third.
6568740	6573740	This is pretty much everything else is coming out on the third road to Guangdong.
6573740	6584740	Wiley Jetman, Astro Monkey's Revenge Sweeper Edition, NBA 2K21, The Sojourn, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2, The Persistence Hode, Ministry of Broadcast.
6584740	6586740	That just sounds like a cool name.
6586740	6592740	Marvel's Avengers, Minecraft Dungeons, Kingdoms of Amalur Re-Reckoning.
6592740	6597740	Oh, actually, I'm getting way past that. Those last two were from the seventh. OK, I'm done.
6597740	6603740	You know what? We're not here next week, so it's OK. You give them a sneak peek of what to look forward to in a couple of weeks.
6603740	6609740	Alright, well then also, Ninja Legends on the 10th, Initial Drift, Holy Potatoes Compendium.
6609740	6611740	And that's all I'm going to do.
6611740	6617740	Every potato is holy, in my opinion. Alright, except I'm not as big on sweet potatoes.
6617740	6620740	I'm going to be honest. I know it's a big thing for some people, not really.
6620740	6623740	I'm a big fan of purple mountain yams.
6623740	6630740	Alright, let's move on with some more stories and then we'll get to the listener roundtable. First off, Loki.
6630740	6637740	Alright, so there's a new mobile AR game coming because there's not enough of those.
6637740	6645740	This time it is in the Witcher universe, so it's the Witcher Monster Slayer.
6645740	6652740	And it's your typical AR game where you're going to be fighting monsters and in the first person.
6652740	6658740	Kind of reminds me a little bit of that Walking Dead AR game that they had.
6658740	6664740	I don't know if it's the same company that puts it out, but yeah, it looks OK.
6664740	6674740	I mean, obviously the trailer they show of it doesn't really show you anything in like literally less than a second of the gameplay there, but I don't know.
6674740	6680740	Yeah, so it's being developed by Spocco, who I have never heard of.
6680740	6689740	But yeah, apparently that is the new hotness in the location gaming space.
6689740	6699740	We'll see. I mean, some of those games come out like garbage, like Garfield Go. Remember that one? That was a real piece of work.
6699740	6705740	Some people were, and there was a Ghostbusters game that I think kind of came and went pretty quick.
6705740	6709740	There's a Walking Dead game that kind of came and went real quick.
6709740	6715740	The Jurassic Park one, I played that for a little bit. It was OK. I didn't get super into it, but I know other people did.
6715740	6722740	Like, I know people that will play Pokemon Go and that. See, I kind of found that my limit is three, and three is a lot.
6722740	6729740	And if Pokemon didn't have the Bluetooth, I probably couldn't do three. But I play Ingress, I play Pokemon Go, and I play Orna.
6729740	6733740	And those are the three I can do. I gave up Harry Potter. Harry Potter's gone.
6733740	6742740	But that, you know, I know that's another popular AR game. That's also a Niantic-based one, so they've got a really great database of stuff in there.
6742740	6745740	All right. We'll see how The Witcher turns out.
6745740	6757740	I think the thing that makes the Niantic games really, really work is that the populated system of interesting places that, granted, is all user-made.
6757740	6761740	And I know it has its problems in rural areas, but it's getting better.
6761740	6768740	I think that population or that database of all those cool locations is what really boosts those games.
6768740	6776740	Because then when you look at a game like Jurassic World or whatever, they're in random places. Everything's in random places.
6776740	6783740	And the one thing I liked about Orna, or still like about Orna, is that you can build your own stuff in the world.
6783740	6791740	And I would like to see more games like that, where you're literally building your own stuff that affects other players as well, if you wanted to.
6791740	6795740	You can also keep it private, so that you're not giving away where your house is, which is a smart thing to do.
6795740	6802740	But I like that, though. If you're limited on where, especially in a pandemic when you're supposed to be staying at home,
6802740	6808740	I do like that you can build things nearby so that you have those resources.
6808740	6812740	But at the same time, there's still things that you have to go out and find.
6812740	6816740	So I like that quite a bit that they make it simple like that.
6817740	6827740	So we'll see if The Witcher ends up being on the Harry Potter, pretty decent AR game side of things, Jurassic World, or on the Garfield side of things.
6827740	6838740	Well, CD Projekt now, they own the majority stake in this company, so they probably will have quite a bit of influence on it. So hopefully that's a good thing.
6838740	6847740	They must believe in it. Well, let's talk about the Game Awards for the year 2020, because the Game Awards take place every December.
6847740	6851740	And Dark Soccer, are you okay?
6851740	6859740	Your mute is in the wrong place, because I think we just heard what you didn't want us to hear, and now we don't hear you.
6862740	6864740	You're still muted, my friend.
6864740	6867740	Sorry, I bumped my mute button as I was burping.
6867740	6874740	And I did it by complete accident, so now I'm a fucking lady, okay.
6874740	6877740	Guess what, everybody, women burp.
6877740	6883740	We fart, we take big huge dumps when we have to, we are human.
6883740	6884740	Get over it.
6887740	6888740	Alright.
6890740	6893740	This lesson brought to you by Dark Sagra. Alright.
6895740	6896740	Moving on.
6897740	6901740	See, there is my mute button, and it is obnoxiously easy to hit.
6901740	6908740	You know, this show has never been nominated for a Game Award, and I can't possibly imagine why.
6908740	6912740	Because people often know who you are in order to be like an influencer.
6912740	6913740	We got an award.
6913740	6920740	We did, not a Game Award, we got a podcast award in like, what, 2004, but we...
6921740	6922740	Alright.
6922740	6926740	No, we love the awards that we've won and have been nominated for.
6926740	6932740	I'll never forget that live 365 award ceremony where they forgot our name.
6932740	6937740	And you can hear it in the recording when they're saying like, and nominated for Station of the Year.
6937740	6938740	We have dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.
6938740	6944740	And then like she starts to open the envelope and you hear Loki on the official recording in the back of the room.
6944740	6945740	Hey!
6945740	6946740	Hey!
6949740	6951740	And she goes, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, and Orange Sounds Radio.
6951740	6953740	And it was like, and that was the moment.
6953740	6956740	I know, we were like, well, we didn't win, obviously.
6957740	6959740	Guess we'll get another drink.
6959740	6960740	I want something.
6960740	6961740	I want the speakers.
6961740	6963740	You want a, yeah, that's right.
6963740	6966740	I'm glad we didn't all go home empty handed that night.
6966740	6974740	Oh, yeah, I also got, what was it, like an IR remote, like a TV remote for my computer for some reason.
6975740	6977740	I didn't get shit.
6977740	6986740	I didn't get, the one thing I remember from that night as well, because we all, it's, you know, now that we all kind of have our, we all have our own things.
6986740	6989740	So it's very rare and especially obviously we're in a pandemic.
6989740	6994740	We don't get to do anything together now, but it's rarely that the three of us get to go on a complete adventure together.
6994740	6996740	Like we went to PAX together that one year.
6996740	6997740	That was a lot of fun.
6997740	7000740	But we all went to the live 365 awards in the Bay Area together.
7000740	7014740	And I remember when the car, we parked the car and the first space I wanted, I couldn't take because some fucking limo or something, or no, it wasn't even a limo, but just like a large car had took up like three parking spaces.
7014740	7017740	And Dark Sakura goes, give me a, give me a post-it.
7017740	7018740	You have post-its in here, right?
7018740	7023740	And I'm like, I have Hello Kitty, Hello Kitty post-its and Dark Sakura was like, perfect.
7023740	7032740	And she takes a piece of Hello Kitty stationary post-it and puts, you park like an asshole and puts it on the car.
7032740	7034740	I still do that.
7034740	7045740	But it's just, it wasn't just that you left a note that said you park like an asshole, but you put it on Hello Kitty stationary is what literally drives that home.
7045740	7047740	Anyway, where were we?
7047740	7051740	I need to, I actually do have a Hello Kitty stationary that I keep at my desk.
7051740	7054740	I should just start carrying it with me and do that some more.
7054740	7055740	All right.
7055740	7058740	Anyhow, excuse me, back to the Game Awards.
7058740	7062740	So a ceremony nobody will be parking at this year because it's going to be all virtual.
7062740	7063740	It's the Game Awards.
7063740	7067740	So 2020 Game Awards is going to be going virtual.
7067740	7074740	Jeff Keeley confirmed this in a recent interview with IGN saying, quote, what I will say about is this.
7074740	7076740	We have a very interesting plan for the show this year.
7076740	7077740	We're definitely doing it.
7077740	7079740	A lot of people are asking, are you delaying it?
7079740	7081740	The Oscars are being postponed.
7081740	7082740	Are you postponing the Game Awards?
7082740	7083740	We are not.
7083740	7087740	We'll share more in the coming weeks, but it's actually probably going to be our biggest show yet.
7087740	7092740	We're not going to have 10,000 people in a room together, but I think you'll see a little bit of this with how we do Gamescom.
7092740	7095740	We're definitely doing more than just me in a room announcing winners.
7095740	7099740	I'm really passionate about still doing the show live versus something prerecorded.
7099740	7107740	So, yeah, we're working on some scenarios for ways we can present the show live with a bit of a spectacle to people without the public being able to buy tickets to come to the show and things like that this year.
7107740	7116740	You know, and I have to admit, like I, I don't think the show is going to lose that much without having the audience there live.
7116740	7121740	In fact, in some ways, I kind of think that might be a detract from the show right now.
7121740	7133740	So, I kind of think when they have to just focus on the nominees, the game announcements, the creators that will undoubtedly be there on Zoom and so forth, I think it could be a very interesting show this year.
7133740	7135740	So, we'll see.
7135740	7139740	Some comments from our Twitch chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
7139740	7145740	Black Compat says, I'm interested to see what will be in the categories this year for the Game Awards.
7145740	7148740	That's true because they do tend to mix up the categories.
7148740	7167740	Are they going to maybe do something that relates to this whole maybe pandemic situation that we're in like best game to play in 2020 in the state of the world and it's Jackbox Party Pack Part Six, Jackbox Party Pack Part Five, Jackbox Party Pack Part Four, and so on.
7167740	7181740	Bobby says, it's really just about the game announcements. Now the good thing is if they need less money they can spend more time on the awards. There is that too. So, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm curious to see what this looks like in virtual form.
7181740	7193740	You know, and this kind of came up when we were talking about conventions and it was really on Bobby's show, because he was kind of talking about missing the in person conventions and there was a, there was a discussion that was happening in chat about how, you know,
7193740	7200740	some people hoped that maybe the virtual convention idea stays around forever.
7200740	7215740	And I think ultimately we all know you know we talked about what is the new normal. What is this world going to look like when we finally get to the other side of COVID and you know some some people say and reasonably so COVID will probably never go away.
7215740	7228740	But we'll just get it under control like measles is a good example measles is not eradicated measles is still on this planet, but generally you don't have a problem with measles in the US because most people get vaccinated for it, and we reasonably have that disease
7228740	7242740	under control. Hopefully that's where we get COVID to. But what does our new normal look like as a result of that and I know I've said on this show before, I think masks and wearing masks when you're sick and that I think we're going to see.
7242740	7255740	I think we're going to see this country at least certain parts of this country big cities, because we all know there's people that are pushing back on masks. I'm not going to go there, but I think I think generally in the big cities, you're going to see us
7255740	7266740	kind of picking up some cultural norms that have been done in Asia for a long time is that when people are sick and they're on the subway they're wearing a fucking mask, because people are going to own all these masks now.
7266740	7272740	So, you know, I kind of think that will be around. But also, when to get to the point.
7272740	7282740	I think some of the ways that we've adopted the virtual world, just like it's going to change our corporate jobs I think many more people are going to work from home now that they've proven they can do it.
7282740	7290740	I think that's going to change the culture significantly not everybody's I can affect everybody at every job, but I think there are many organizations that are going to adopt more work at home.
7290740	7308740	But I also think this idea of how do we blend the virtual with the in person. I think we're going to see a lot of that. After this, you know, most people know how to use zoom in this country after this point, which is a weird thing to think about but they
7308740	7320740	they use zoom with schools they use zooms with work they use zoom with meetings, most, and whatever, insert Microsoft Teams Discord whatever you're using to video chat with people.
7320740	7332740	That's going to be embedded in our culture so I just I kind of feel like whatever virtual form the game awards ends up taking this year. There may be a taste of that in future game awards.
7332740	7334740	If that makes sense.
7334740	7340740	Michael I've talked for a lot on that do I co host have any thoughts on that.
7340740	7342740	I've seen already happening.
7342740	7344740	How so.
7344740	7360740	Well, just that because we are looking at, you know, you get more people saying, Oh, when do I tune into this online, you know, for example, we have a lot of that, or, you know, people just assuming already that it's not going to be an in person event.
7360740	7363740	But mines are already leaning in that direction.
7363740	7372740	And, you know, and I'm even, you know, just in talking to other people's like, Oh, I think I have a cold let me grab my mask.
7372740	7376740	You know, I am seeing that a lot more often so it's happening. Yeah.
7376740	7388740	And then some comments from our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network as she says, I can foresee cons and fests offering a digital only pass where you can see streamed panels from the show archive things and some interactive stuff.
7388740	7397740	I can totally see that happening from this point on. It's just a revenue stream that can't be ignored. The only problem is infrastructure due to stream stuff from these events.
7397740	7408740	Yeah, and you know even dragon con had the dragon con TV pass you could buy I think you had to still like they only sold it to people that actually attended dragon con Bobby correct me if I'm wrong but I feel like that was the thing.
7408740	7423740	But I feel like maybe after this year. They, they may kind of have something a little more open with the I mean, obviously, nothing is going to be able to totally replace that being in the same room being there and all that.
7423740	7431740	But I think this is really going to make us think about what can we also offer for the people who don't want to, or can't.
7431740	7437740	And I kind of feel like that might get enhanced a little bit moving forward, we'll see. We'll see.
7437740	7438740	All right.
7438740	7452740	Let's move on. Anyway, I spent a lot of time on this topic. Let's move on. And Bobby Blackfield says dragon con TV never broadcast live on the internet. The on demand stuff was just repeats, and that's why they only sold it to the people that went anyway that's or I'm adding that part.
7452740	7462740	And that makes sense. So, and DJ rama SS current infrastructure and most hotels and convention centers cannot handle high bandwidths of streaming content.
7462740	7469740	I don't disagree with that. But I think due to all this.
7469740	7481740	I don't think that is going to be an excuse that these convention centers can have much longer. They're going to have to get with the times and get that type of bandwidth, and I understand easier said than done.
7481740	7491740	You can never totally foresee the amount and so on and so on but I do feel like this is something that that industry is going to struggle with and have to work with as we move back.
7491740	7498740	Anyway, I do want to move on for time sake but some great great comments, a dark soccer What do we have next.
7498740	7508740	Well, um, there is going to be another adaption for Resident Evil, but it's another live action series and it's going to be on Netflix.
7508740	7518740	It was announced that it will be focused on the Wesker kids so I guess referring to Albert Wesker who's like, you know, one of the main bad guys.
7518740	7536740	I understand that the first season will have eight one hour episodes it's actually written by one of the writers for Supernatural, Andrew Dabin, and the first two episodes will be directed by Bronwyn Hughes who did some walking dead and Breaking Bad.
7536740	7545740	I don't know how I feel about it, just because I wish that they would go back and do something, you know, more based directly off of the games and not just like these little side stories.
7545740	7549740	I mean, but they have to do they have to do to make money off of it I guess.
7549740	7559740	But Resident Evil really is seeing this resurgence with all the game remake so it only, you know, stands to reason they try to you know milk that cow a little bit more.
7559740	7573740	Yeah, and maybe, maybe doing the story like this kind of helps the series not get compared to the games, you know what I mean, like it's like, oh, they didn't do it that way because they did it in the games they got it wrong, like it's going to kind of avoid that
7573740	7583740	by doing a separate story so that may be part of it right yeah but but at the same time I mean, we've got like two different continuity is now.
7583740	7593740	Well, I'll be perfectly honest the things that I always enjoyed outside of the games were those CG movies that they did like degeneration.
7593740	7596740	Those were fun. I love those.
7596740	7606740	I actually I think I'm funny the first one of those that I watched was simply because it had on it's doing the soundtrack in it and I ended up loving the movie.
7606740	7608740	So,
7608740	7616740	I don't know, I mean, I don't really have a lot of hopes I didn't, you know, watch many of the movies past like a couple of them.
7616740	7636740	So I don't really have a lot of notion preconceived notion for this one, although you know I love Supernatural so I like most of the writing for Supernatural so I am really looking forward to seeing if that same writing prowess, you know translates
7636740	7644740	over to Resident Evil fairly well. I'm also very sad about this being the last season of Supernatural, I'm a little bitter, a little.
7644740	7648740	It's been it's had a hell of a run they've been doing it 15 years they're allowed to retire.
7648740	7664740	So, with Resident Evil though the Netflix, you know, video game stuffs really been hitting it out of the park recently between The Witcher and Castlevania, so I can see, you know, and we this subject has come up on the show before how it seems like there's
7664740	7677740	just like this avalanche of gaming content about to be released because of the success of those things, such as we know there's a Final Fantasy 14 series in the works there's, there's plenty of other stuff to that it's just escaping me in the moment.
7677740	7691740	There's lots of stuff that's in the works and I think Resident Evil is just the first one where it's like, oh, now we're seeing a picture of a script we're seeing some other details like the it's happening like that, you know, this is this is for real real now not just talk.
7691740	7702740	Yeah, I don't know I, I'm gonna, I'd like to just with just about anything these days I, I would rather reserve my judgment that be super disappointed. Yeah, fair enough.
7702740	7706740	All right, let's move on to our next story Loki.
7706740	7709740	All right.
7709740	7718740	So let's talk a little bit about Fall Guys, because that is a very popular game nowadays in fact it's so popular it's the most downloaded PlayStation Plus game ever.
7718740	7723740	I played a little today, and lost on the second level, but I played a little.
7723740	7730740	Yeah, I mean I'm sure a lot of that was because it was, you know, free obviously PlayStation Plus and everything but it's very popular.
7730740	7736740	And then, of course, you know with season two right around the corner I'm sure it's just gonna become more popular.
7736740	7739740	Of course, as most popular things are.
7739740	7757740	They are modded into other games and so because of that, you know, the common games you would see mods for like Skyrim for example has a fallout or fall fall guys followers mod that you can get which is looks hilarious.
7757740	7763740	And then of course there's also some Resident Evil three mods that allow you.
7763740	7769740	It's called a jelly bean turns Jill Carlos and nemesis into beans.
7769740	7776740	It looks pretty silly. So, I'm gonna have to definitely check out the one for Skyrim. Yeah, sounds funny.
7776740	7785740	I would like to see you remember that mod that allows you to like roll 10,000 cabbages down a hill. How about 10,000 fall guys.
7785740	7792740	10,000 cabbages that's not even a mod that's just just a game you can just spawn that stuff in.
7792740	7797740	I'd like to see 10,000 fall guys falling down the hill will be fun. Sounds good. All right.
7797740	7810740	Lastly, before we get to wrapping things up tonight. Bobby Black Wolf, are you out there you paying attention because I've got a story for you. And this is going to definitely be a game of the year contender for you.
7810740	7824740	Okay, there's a little bit of an inside joke here that is really been beaten into the ground over the past few years. But how about one more inside joke for Nino Cooney because Nino Cooney, they just announced this week is going to be getting an MMO.
7824740	7838740	It's called Nino Cooney cross worlds, and I do I feel like the story, maybe Bobby Black Wolf inspired because wait till you hear this in the game now, Nino Cooney explores like the link between worlds that's what this is about.
7838740	7844740	But in this game you are going to be a VR game beta tester.
7844740	7848740	That's right, VR is part of the plot you pay attention Bobby.
7848740	7863740	I've already lost interest, but this game, you just well the game itself isn't VR but it's part of the story. So you are playing the role of a VR game beta tester and you discover the world of the VR game is real.
7863740	7886740	Right, it's kinda, it's kinda dot hack like that. I was just about to say that. So anyway, it's only been confirmed for Japanese iOS and Android phones, but I'm sure our pal Bobby would appreciate it if you would start your hashtag campaigns to ensure that we get an English and localized release for this game as well.
7886740	7893740	There's no exact date or anything like that. But, I mean, it does look, it looks not it looks pretty.
7893740	7905740	I only think it's kind of disappointing because I'm like wow, this is so pretty I'd want to play it on a console, but okay the mobile phones get to have good things once in a while, and again if it's designed for mobile phones, it might not be such a bad mobile
7905740	7920740	phone game. Games that are designed with the phone in mind tend to do all right so I'm curious. We will see. Anyway, what's that, Rob. There are really beautiful people who are garbage inside their hearts.
7920740	7931740	It looks pretty is not an indication of how good that game is going to be. That, that is, that is very true. Yeah, yeah, just saying research your judgment don't get too excited.
7931740	7943740	Yeah, that's true. There's a very, especially this year. I don't know, it's like everyone 2020 all I was like, shut up about politics Rob shut up about politics Rob show up about okay I can't help myself.
7943740	7956740	Okay, so like, what's her name, the ex wife of Gavin Newsom that gave that speech, where she looked like she was Madonna and Evita going.
7957740	7961740	Like if I was actually more thinking of Ivanka.
7961740	7972740	If she's a very, she's a very pretty, pretty smart person if I pass garbage, if I pass them on the street, I would be like she's really pretty. I bet that's a great wig.
7972740	7974740	Your makeup is beautiful.
7974740	7981740	But, you know. All right, anyway. Oh, let's get some comments from Bobby Blackwell.
7981740	7986740	Bobby Blackwell for saying I Nino Cooney trying too hard. Stay in Japan.
7986740	7995740	Hashtag say Nino to Nino Cooney MMO in America.
7995740	7999740	Say Nino nice to Nino Cooney that's a good one Bobby.
7999740	8006740	You had to know that was coming for 12345 stories, so you marinating on that one.
8006740	8022740	I love it. All right. Anyhow, let's move on. It's time for the listener roundtable if you guys have any questions, ask away in our chat anything that we have or maybe haven't talked about yet tonight on the show, please feel free to pop that in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network.
8022740	8041740	We would also take this opportunity to check our mailbag every week you guys can email us participate at orange lounge radio.com, but I believe in checking with postmaster dark Sakura, who's a better postmaster than the one that's running the you anyway, the mailbag is empty right.
8041740	8053740	Yeah. All right, bummer. Well maybe next week participate at orange lounge radio.com. However, I will take this opportunity to mention we had a comment over at vog network.com on last week's show.
8053740	8058740	But before I get to that comment I think Loki you have an obligation to have to step away right.
8058740	8068740	Yes I do refrigerator drama. All right. Oh boy, well the garage that needs to be in the kitchen. All right, we have to replace our refrigerator soon so it'll be my turn next probably.
8068740	8074740	All right, well I hope everything's okay. Did you have any last minute, or I'm sorry not last sorry. Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight.
8074740	8082740	No, just have a good week. I'll see you in a few weeks. Oh yeah, we'll see you in two weeks Loki, thank you and good luck with refrigerator drama.
8082740	8083740	Right.
8083740	8097740	All right. And then it was just me and dark soccer here on discord the discord image will fix itself in a moment here, but I do want to read this comment here from e three v l because you can leave comments over at vog network.com on episodes, and I haven't
8097740	8112740	always been great about reading those on air, but since we've tried to consolidate the roundtable a little bit it reminds me to check on that. So I will point out e three v l commented on the last episode fall guys is free on PS plus, as long as you have a subscription,
8112740	8126740	you must claim it by the end of the month so yeah time is running out on that by the way and I think I saw in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network black compat said, haven't downloaded it yet but plan to and yeah I would get on that my friend, because he
8126740	8138740	had tomorrow I think is the last day you're gonna be able to grab that. So, get out because, yeah, I don't know if they expected fall guys to do as well as it has. So it's only going to be a matter of time before they want to start charging money for that again
8138740	8155740	so, but thank you for that e three v l and also of importance, e three v l gives their Animal Crossing new horizons island dream code for us to visit, potentially on the next episode of Animal Crossing lounge radio, which I need to check and make sure nobody else
8155740	8165740	is using that title I just figured why would anyone use Animal Crossing lounge radio, you would do you do you remember my spin off show courthouse.
8165740	8171740	Yeah. Did you know that at one point I considered calling that show Warcraft lounge radio.
8171740	8185740	And you know what, what another another show started the week before courthouse did called Warcraft lounge radio. I don't know if there's, I don't know if they're still going on what we don't we don't own the patent on lounge radio.
8185740	8199740	They can do it was a fine. It was a fine show I have nothing negative to say about it is one of those I hope nobody beat us to it. Yeah. Anyway, maybe some, maybe somebody, maybe Tiger claws looking right now maybe.
8199740	8213740	I don't know who knows. Anyway, act deft in talking about the refrigerator issues that Loki is having says if only it were easy to move stuff like an Animal Crossing, everything turns into a leaf.
8213740	8225740	That's right, except with my luck I'd keep picking the wrong thing. Like I would be trying to pick up this desk and I tried to pick it up and then all of a sudden I just pulled the posters down from the wall.
8225740	8227740	So, anyway.
8227740	8239740	Bobby Blackwell says Google has no results for Warcraft lounge radio. Well, they might have pod faded they, this was, you know, courthouse was 2012, so it'd be pretty impressive if they were still going but I really don't know what about Animal Crossing
8239740	8242740	lounge radio. That's the one I, by the way.
8242740	8251740	You might be interested to know that I finally on Facebook retired the game archive to the danger squad group.
8251740	8255740	Oh, that's kind of sad that was our old Warcraft Guild.
8256740	8272740	I understand, I understand why you archive did I was like 10 years ago we were all rating there but it's always, it's always a moment of, oh, you know, you know what else I found, what's that I found the the thing that that.
8272740	8277740	Why can I not remember his nickname. Now, well quickly.
8277740	8286740	Bobby with a follow up saying the only results for Animal Crossing lounge radio is what came up on vog is vog stuff from our one episode we did so yay.
8286740	8298740	Slidekick. I do not know why I cannot remember his nickname because I was thinking of the drag name. He's also first mate slide kick on game buoy although their episodes have been unfortunately very sporadic in the pandemic but we understand.
8298740	8307740	Well, we had an idea for doing a comic. And I think you might remember this called Hills Brad blues.
8307740	8313740	And I just found all the, all the renders I pulled like you know five year old renders.
8313740	8317740	And the first panel of the comic we did.
8318740	8333740	We kind of flew by it at the top of the show but one of the things that was announced at that Gamescom event was that the official date for shadow lands the next Warcraft expansion is out which is October 27 I believe these are 27th in Europe, but I think
8333740	8341740	because of time zones it's actually like the, the 26th in the evening here, but we we have a general date for when that's coming out.
8341740	8354740	I, I don't know if it's gonna get me to play though, yeah, and that's where my head's at is that like I, I think I'm kind of done with wow but I don't know then if I, then I'm going to hear everybody, because I had that show Horde house.
8354740	8366740	I made a lot of Warcraft community friends. I went to BlizzCon and and did one of the pre events, years ago and I had a great time and I still have many friends I made in that community are just good people.
8366740	8374740	And I feel like when they all start lying about it on Twitter. It's gonna make me want to go.
8374740	8378740	Yes, it's FOMO right.
8378740	8390740	And I'll be honest, the biggest thing that really pushed me away from playing well from really enjoying it was the shit they pulled with Sylvanas, and I'm like, I'm done. Yeah, done. Yeah.
8390740	8400740	No more. I cannot stand it. As much as I freaking love that, you know, I had all this fun Illidan stuff and I was really getting into it I was so happy. And then they fucked over Sylvanas.
8400740	8414740	Yeah, and took away my demon elf husband. It was, it was really weird how they handled her story so I don't know I guess I'm gonna wait and see but I also feel like one MMO is really truly enough and you know FOMO SC 14 is just kind of where I'm at.
8414740	8418740	Do you know how many I might be. I'm still considering Star Trek online.
8418740	8428740	That's fun. Yeah, I, um, the folks that were with a starboard power coupling I know that show hasn't been out in a while but it was, it was a show here at vogue for a while.
8428740	8441740	Can Dr. Ken plays that game still pretty regularly I think and enjoys it so I made some really good friends, because when I was playing it I was super unemployed are fun employed.
8441740	8456740	And so I was playing late night and so most people I played with were in the UK and I'm still really good friends with a couple of people that that I played with a good architect friend lives in Edinburgh, so it's pretty fun.
8457740	8459740	Um, question in our chat.
8459740	8473740	Fat Ninja DM in chat asks, will you guys and gals be playing New World when it releases next year that is the Amazon MMO that they've been working on for forever. So I'm gonna, I'm gonna admit that game was not on my radar.
8473740	8484740	But I don't know, are they having an open beta or a closed beta something's going on with that game right now because I see people on Twitch streaming it, and one of my friends was streaming it the other night, and I have to say, it wasn't on my radar
8484740	8501740	but when I watched my friend stream I was like, okay, this looks interesting. I kind of like the way the magic was was kind of neat, like he was his character was up on a hill, and he was launching fireballs like they were bow and arrow down on this other group
8501740	8515740	of people like literally raining fire on them. And I was like, okay, that's like you know yes in Warcraft you also rain fire on people but it doesn't, it doesn't have that same feel that like of like oh there's like physics involved in this, this whole thing.
8515740	8527740	So, it kind of looked neat, I have to admit, my, my curiosity was not piqued until I saw it being played on Twitch, which happens right Twitch has been a great way to sample games right.
8528740	8531740	I really don't care about it.
8531740	8536740	And the big reason I don't care about it is because I don't want to care about it.
8536740	8552740	Right now, I have so much on my plate and such a backlog and I really want to get into more familiar territory with some of the games that I'm playing just things that are fun to me, and I don't really want to try anything super new in that respect that makes sense.
8552740	8568740	It does. It's like when you eat the same thing for lunch every day because it's really good and it makes you happy. Yeah, I'm doing I'm in the same game. I get that but, and, and probably you know it's not just because it's not Animal Crossing because I've got other games that I'm playing I have other things I'm looking forward to.
8568740	8577740	But I don't want to dip my toes into another MMO universe when I'm not doing any MMOs right now.
8577740	8588740	There's also and there's a big difference between the commitment for like an MMO, and the commitment for a game that like I recommended to you earlier in the show I think telling lies would be something up your alley.
8588740	8601740	Well, you can you can experience telling lies in like two three hours. You know, I'm not saying you're gonna get, but I think there's a bit there's that level of commitment, and I get that is that like you know I don't I don't have time to get sucked into another
8601740	8612740	MMO, but you know I do have time for this, this other little this puzzle game I can play in a short burst fall guys I can play for five minutes and be done with it, you know, or whatever it is.
8612740	8624740	And I can actually do some well on my own, how I got to level at in well by myself remember with anybody without doing a single dungeon.
8624740	8628740	You know I just did them all by myself, I like.
8628740	8638740	It's just the thing is that I don't, you know, it was kind of probably have a Final Fantasy 14 at first was that I couldn't just be through the, you know, do stuff in the game by myself and level that way effectively.
8638740	8642740	It kind of made me do that for the quest lines.
8642740	8655740	But you know Star Trek online, I could go in and just, you know, if I wanted to just futz around I could just you know take myself over to most of my characters probably still at quarks on Deep Space Nine.
8655740	8667740	But you know I could was some with something like that I could just sort of, you know, play around in it, you know, have like a good 10 minutes of just exploring doing a couple battles, going to plan it, boom I'm done.
8667740	8679740	And that was it. I don't really want to involve myself in a new MMO, and have to commit myself to learning its environment learning, it's.
8679740	8696740	It's a culture, because you know you're in a memo it's gonna have its own culture built into the game if it's any fucking good. So I really don't want to have to expose myself to that quite yet when there are other MMOs that I have enjoyed in the past
8696740	8700740	that I could be revisiting if I wanted to, which I do not.
8700740	8710740	And SJ100Matt has a good comparison here in chat saying it's like starting a new TV series with five plus seasons that you haven't seen, but everyone has seen it's a large commitment.
8710740	8715740	There are some shows you can't just have in the background that you have to focus on like Game of Thrones.
8715740	8729740	And yeah, like that's that's a great like it's very, it's very easy for me to say okay you know what, I can binge the Castlevania anime because there's only well now there's three seasons but there's one season and like six episodes.
8729740	8742740	I can do that. But yeah, when you start to get and this happens to me all the time is that like, even a show that I really enjoy like The Good Place and Shane is always saying when are you gonna finish that when are you gonna finish that it's like my backlog
8742740	8750740	keeps getting bigger and bigger I just don't know when I'm going to be able to do it but then some other smaller show will sneak in it's like oh yeah I binge it because it was only a couple hours.
8750740	8754740	So, it just just kind of depends on what you have room for at the time.
8754740	8768740	So, all right, well on that note I think we're going to wrap things up for the night and I will say, thank you for taking the time to work Orange Launch Radio into your week, whether you joined us here live on Sunday night, or you're listening to our podcast at some point
8768740	8786740	throughout the week on a platform like iTunes, Spotify, Google Podcasts, wherever it is that you listen to podcasts. Thank you so much for choosing Orange Launch Radio to fill quite a bit of your time, more than the normal podcast this week, but we make no apologies for the length of our show it's the way it's always been.
8786740	8801740	So thank you so much for checking us out. If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice but we need the voices to be here to help put them out on air.
8801740	8810740	A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this show goes a long way. Auto hosts for VOG Network on Twitch really go a long way.
8810740	8821740	Thank you to those you I wish I had a list that still showed me who did that Twitch took that away a while ago so I don't know who's hosting, but I will just say thank you if you are one of the people that does that we really really appreciate it.
8821740	8833740	On that note, I think we'll wrap things up, remember programming note we will not be here next week, due to virtual dragon con and the Labor Day holiday. I hope all of you out there in the states have a wonderful Labor Day holiday.
8834740	8844740	If you're somewhere else I hope you have a wonderful weekend whatever it is you're doing this weekend. Please be safe. Remember just because you're done with COVID doesn't mean COVID is done with you.
8844740	8856740	Please continue to wear your masks, social distance. Let's get through this we have some hopefully promising things that are going to help, such as this rapid test that's all up in the news these past couple days.
8856740	8865740	It's not going to fix it but it's going to help and hopefully we'll continue to make progress over the next few months but we've got to wear our masks. We've got a social distance and keep following the rules, so please keep that in mind.
8865740	8870740	Speaking of masks. Yeah. Did you see Lady Gaga's horn mask.
8870740	8877740	It's beautiful and I want one everyone I didn't have to show me that if you want to make wearing a mask interesting.
8877740	8880740	Do stuff to it. Keep it effective.
8880740	8895740	But go to town, make everybody think, Oh, gosh, this person is fashionable I want to be like them. I hated the idea of masks at first because I didn't like the idea of Heidi I mean I wore them for scientific reasons only, but I've warmed up to them a lot
8895740	8903740	because now I'm like, Oh, you can get masks that are fun and festive. It's kind of like underwear but it's like everybody can see it.
8903740	8908740	Underwear that's fun to wear. Yeah, exactly. Except it's like, over where I was.
8908740	8914740	I was having a chat with somebody at Oto's the other day is the local Japanese market.
8914740	8928740	And we were just talking about how they become like our fashion accessories here. I was like, Well, I mean, and and you know I'd already adapted, not, not like doing this like as a bow I did this earlier before everybody, but I had adopted wearing masks at work
8928740	8937740	if I had a cold or I was sick because I get sinus infection so often, but I wouldn't know if it was a sinus infection or if I had a cold or if I had the flu or something.
8937740	8947740	So for me, I always had these charcoal masks at my desk that I pick up a die so in a box, so that I was sick, I didn't get somebody else.
8947740	8959740	And right when everything started going on right before I got pneumonia. People were like, I heard you have masks, I heard you have masks, I'm like,
8959740	8963740	Bobby black, I hate wearing a bra.
8963740	8972740	Bobby black open chat says, I look at it kind of like ties, you can have fun ties if you have to wear a suit, I hate wearing a suit so wearing a fun tie makes it tolerable.
8972740	8980740	Same way with masks. Yes, I wear my mask I promise. So yeah, it's a little fun little fun to be had. All right, anyway, let's get our final thoughts.
8980740	8987740	I just say don't be a mass commando. Yeah, I'm dark soccer final thought tonight.
8987740	8989740	Party words for our listeners this week.

8996740	9007740	I ordered you a thing yes I did. It's going to take a while to arrive. That's because of where I ordered it from, but I will give you a clue if you want to try to guess what it is.

9040740	9053740	All right. Okay. Um, so that's, that's that we're all wrapped up for the night. My final thought would be, I kind of I guess I already kind of said it the whole thing I just said a minute ago is stay safe with with COVID and all that I don't need to
