0	14000	I've asked before what future generations of consoles are going to bring. 3D? Dead.
14000	18300	Motion control? Stable but dwindling. 8K? Inevitably expected. So what's left? A game
18300	21880	preview has purportedly leaked a deeper game integration via the console dashboard, like
21880	25560	jumping straight into time trials on a racing game, online battle or story mode for shooters
25560	29520	and so on, all happening at the console menu which should save time for everyone. This
29520	33200	is just my opinion. Plenty more still to come from your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers
33200	36820	and Loki on this and all the news of the week starting right now on the show where every
36820	38760	gamer has a voice.
38760	46640	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where
46640	53460	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Back live again tonight with episode
53460	60020	number 830 for this August the 2nd of 2020. I can't believe it's August already at the
60020	65340	same time this year has been quite a wash, hasn't it? My name is Rob Roberts and I'm
65340	70660	joining you with my friends that I met playing Dance Dance Revolution about 20 years ago
70660	74700	at the local arcade. And at some point we decided, hey, you know, we should start a
74700	78760	podcast or we should at that time podcasting didn't quite start yet. So it was like we
78760	83140	should do a live internet show about DDR and music games because we love them so much.
83140	86100	And then after a couple of years, it was like, why are we limiting ourselves to music
86100	92160	games? Let's talk about all video games, classics, new stuff, just celebrating gaming and gaming
92160	98740	culture. And one of my co-hosts is Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers. Hello.
98740	108060	Oh, hi. How are you? I am. I'm okay. Good. You're looking looking fabulous as always.
108060	114780	Thanks. I just pulled this one out for today. I'm pleased with it. That got an immediate
114780	123340	immediate. Yes. New wig in our chat from VGRealness. So I may be I may be digging out some others
123340	127780	like at this point, I'm actually thinking about investing in more mannequins. You know,
127780	132340	the wig mannequins right now, though, I have that black one I wore last week because right
132340	136900	now it's probably my favorite, like as a daily wear. And I thought it looked really good.
136940	143780	I showed it to my physical therapist and she's like, that's not you. That's you. So and everyone's
143780	147300	like, you should dye your hair black. You should do black. So what I'm going to do is
147300	152100	next dye I do, it's going to go black, but I'm going to have one that's black with red
152100	158980	tips. Just a streak. Okay. A little streak of fire going there. Okay. I like it. I mean,
158980	166180	I haven't worn I haven't had my hair black since the 90s. Well, whether you come here
166180	170340	for the video game discussion or you come here for the wigs, you can join us live at
172260	177220	twitch.tv slash vog network, the voice geeks network, where we do tape live every Sunday
177220	181620	night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
182340	186020	Please say hello to our other friend that we met playing Dance Dance Revolution.
187140	193540	It's tech master Loki. Hello. Hi, Loki. How are you? I'm fine. All right. Now our chatters are
193620	197940	taunting you tonight about this game that you're running in the background. And again,
197940	201380	I apologize because I know it's a podcast too. And you guys can't see the visuals.
202020	207540	But I will explain. It looks like Loki is playing footage of his game. He never finished
207540	213940	behind him tonight. Is this your game? It is exactly that. Yeah, it's it's it was footage
213940	219620	of the last level that made in its time the car, which unfortunately, I lost that build of the
219620	223380	game. And it's very disappointing because I wanted to go back in at some point and finish it. But
223540	229140	I don't have any recent builds of it. The I don't know what happened to it because I used to back
229140	234820	that up every few days. And for some reason, I only have up to a certain point. I know I was
234820	240660	having corruption issues with that. That was back in Unity 4. I mean, that's really old.
240660	248100	I'm sorry, but is that is that a cat cannon? It is a cannon that does fire cats. They're not
248100	251700	real cats or robotic cats. As you can see, they're flying off in the space.
251780	256020	Would never want to hurt a real cat. No cats are harmed. But you know, it's just a weird
256660	262100	like that was the things like the game had like a lot of weird levels. And whereas I thought this
262100	267380	would be funny just shooting cats to deliver them to these houses, either hitting the window or the
267380	274420	door. It ended up not being as fun. I have better ways to implement that now. But at the time is
274420	278420	like it sounded like it'd be a cool idea. And it took forever to get the little movement for the
278500	283220	cat because it kind of hops around the ground and it can actually pop up walls as well. And
284500	288180	I spent days trying to get that to work. But yeah, unfortunately,
290420	297380	unfortunately, it's lost to time. Your game is in such early stages. You know,
297380	300740	obviously, if this had been a finished product, you would have probably worked on a lot of the
300740	305940	textures and stuff. But in the current state that we see in the video, it's serving some like early
305940	311300	or late 90s virtual reality simulator realness. I love it. No, it was supposed to be like that
311300	316020	was very like low poly. Okay. You know, it's supposed to be that way. Because that was just
316740	321780	I couldn't draw at all. So that hey, like I even like the cat model, like everything is supposed
321780	326260	to like fit together with that. But yeah, if I was to do it again, I'd do it differently. But
326260	332580	like I was just installed to go on it because I had planned on partaking in a game jam this weekend
332580	337940	and just didn't work out circumstances. Had my son's 10th birthday party yesterday.
338900	347060	Wow. 10. Oh my gosh. Yeah. And then I've just had like a terrible headache for the last, you know,
347060	354020	36 hours. So just that. And then, of course, the theme, I just can't think of anything that I'd
354020	358260	want to do with the theme that sounds like fun. So I'm just going to I'm taking the next three
358260	364260	days off anyways. So I may either go back to working on my game, which is probably what I'm
364260	370420	going to end up doing, or kind of want to go back to work on this game. It would be cool. But
370420	378020	whatever you do, whatever you decide to do, good luck. I play around at least. Yeah. Looking in
378020	384020	our chat room, Dark Tetsuya in chat over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network says, Yeah, I think that's
384020	389620	my main hurdle in game design is doing like sprite art. Well, you know, and I imagine that's why
389620	394980	there's a lot of games that decide to do a retro look and feel is because, well, I don't want to
394980	400340	say retro graphics is easier. That would be very insulting to people that have worked very hard on
400340	407060	sprites. And it can be very difficult in a limited space to design certain looks and certain feels.
407060	412420	So but certainly people might have a preference for one type of art design versus another.
412420	417300	But at the same time, you know, and Bobby kind of jumps in there saying, crazy idea, join a team
417300	422900	with other people and help them on their game. And, and I would if if I knew I could dedicate
422900	427300	a certain amount of time to it, but I don't know with just family and Loki doesn't want other
427300	433380	people to have to rely on him. Exactly. Yeah, I get it. But I was gonna say, you know, also,
433380	436900	there's any own Bobby's talking a little bit about this in chat, but I was gonna say,
436900	441300	you know, sometimes there's art packages and art assets and art things out there, you know, and
441300	446180	this is more in response to what Darcy is saying doing sprite art. Well, a game that Loki and I
446180	453220	haven't shut up about on this show for like four months is Orna. And that game, it uses a very kind
453220	459060	of common sprite pack asset thing, because we've seen the characters in other games, which is kind
459060	464180	of funny, but it doesn't matter because a good game is a good game. And so, you know, and Orna
464180	467620	is a lot of fun. That's why we keep playing it. And plus, it's more impressive when you consider
467620	474580	one guy did it, and he's creating a type of Pokemon Go-esque meets Dragon Warrior type of game.
474580	477700	And I hate calling it Pokemon Go, because really the only thing they have in common is that they
477700	483460	both use your GPS. But it's just impressive that it's done by one dude. Yeah, and I just need to
483460	488100	do more. It's more practice. Like even when I was working on this stuff, like I was really rough,
488660	493620	I'm still rough on everything, you know, so, but I know a lot more now than I did back then was
493620	498740	doing it. And a lot of it was like I was focused on the artwork and everything first, and I really
498740	504180	needed to nail down the gameplay. And even like, you know, playing this, you know, I now have like
504180	510100	better ideas of how I implement things differently that would make it look more fun. But like even
510100	515220	small things, like getting the cat thing, the worker, the confetti cannons, that was fun. Just
515220	519620	like lots of like silly things. And then the problem was, I kind of lost sight of what the
519620	525860	game was because it's like, I don't know. Yeah, I get it. I don't know. It was neat for what it's
525860	532980	all to play some of the other levels later. I'll switch up the video. But yeah, it was fun. Like
532980	537540	it was a fun learning experience. I need to finish something though. Let me read a few more comments
537540	541060	in chat and then we'll get into our kickoff topic tonight, which Loki, I'll have you cover here at
541060	546340	the top for us. But some of the things in chat, Phoenix talking, Phoenix7726 talking about the
546340	551540	retro and so forth saying, retro graphics do tend to have a lower ceiling for designs which look
551540	557220	good enough though. Bobby Blackwolf pointing out that that recent Black Lives Matter bundle that
557220	561460	was on itch.io that I know a ton of you picked up because that bundle made a lot of money for a
561460	565380	great cause. There's a lot of, there's several, I shouldn't say a lot, but there's several asset
565380	570500	bundles in it. And that's, you know, there's, there's all types of, not just art, but I think
570500	575700	there was some music in there too. So some of you guys may have some of that content and not even
575700	583140	realize it. So definitely leverage that from your donation to that. Yeah, let's see. And there's
583140	589540	like some jams actually coming up that I know Kenny, he does a lot of these. He's like, he's
589540	596900	know his asset Jesus out there. He does a lot of those CC0 apps, art assets. I actually contribute
596900	602340	to his Patreon and stuff. And so he's doing a jam with his art assets because he releases like
602340	606660	thousands and thousands of thousands of assets for free. They're almost kind of similar style
606660	612820	as this. This was a different artist that did these though. And so his stuff though, he's got
612820	616660	a jamming space around art and I've seen other like kind of fun YouTube videos where they take
616660	621540	an asset pack and they're like, okay, what can you come up with using this art asset pack? I like that
621540	625940	kind of a, you know, a concept a little bit better than like, like the one I was going to do this
625940	631220	weekend was the, the theme was rewind. It's like all the, anything I could think of that would just
631220	636260	with time rewinding. And that sounded kind of boring. So that's why I couldn't think of
636260	643140	anything. So I'm probably not going to do that one, but yeah, I like a lot of those jams,
643140	648420	especially based around art assets. All right. Well, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight,
648420	652580	which is not about an indie game. This is the furthest thing from an indie game. This is the
652580	658420	mother of all AAA titles, but let's talk a little bit about Halo and some of the things that have
658420	665220	happened since the, um, big reveal a couple of weeks ago. Loki. Yeah. So there was a rumor that,
665220	671780	um, Halo Infinite was going to be free to play as far as the multiplayer goes. And this was coming
671780	681780	from, I guess, a, it was published on, I think that the, um, a pre-order page and it was for
681780	687860	this website Smith's Toys. And they had this like kind of little blurb on it said, you know,
687860	692020	the legendary Halo series returns are the most expansive Master Chief campaign yet and
692020	697540	groundbreaking free to play multiplayer experience. And so it talks about, um, you know, pretty
697540	702740	plain. Everyone's like, Whoa, wait, what's going on? You know, what's this? And so finally it was
702740	709300	confirmed by Microsoft, um, that yes, it is going to be free to play at least the multiplayer
709300	714420	portion. There was some other websites that had listed the genre, I guess I want to say it was
714420	719140	like a Japanese website or something like that. That was listing it like as almost like a battle
719140	726260	royale. Um, so maybe there's going to be some battle royale mode to it. I wouldn't be surprised.
726260	729940	A lot of games are kind of putting that in there, but at the very least it would be neat to see that,
729940	734900	you know, multiplayer and Halo is definitely extremely popular and to make that accessible
734900	741380	to everybody, um, at no cost is pretty great. That's a, I'd say another good selling point
741380	749940	for that console. Now this has led to a lot of rampant speculation about Microsoft potentially,
749940	756260	uh, walking away from Xbox gold basically, and, and making the multiplayer free, which, you know,
756260	759860	and I don't want to sound like a broken record, but obviously this is something I've talked about
759860	764900	on the show plenty of times before that I think this is a good direction for Microsoft one. I'm
764900	769220	kind of surprised they didn't make sooner, but you know, in, in reflection, you know, hindsight's
769220	774660	2020, it does make a lot of sense to maneuver it with a new generation that this is going to be,
774660	779460	uh, like kind of like a new way of thinking, if you will, uh, about approaching this next
779460	785780	generation. Now, um, to kind of follow up on that, we have, um, seen some articles and some tweets.
785780	791220	And for example, over on our discord for vog network, which you can join over at vog
791220	796500	network.com that's VOG network.com slash discord. And people chat with us throughout the week and
796500	799540	so forth. And, uh, we have like an orange challenge radio room and people share their
799540	806100	story ideas and so their thoughts on the show and tiger claw posted a story that has the headline
806100	812660	Microsoft will discontinue Xbox live gold and make multiplayer free. And that part is in quotes.
812660	817220	And if you go into, and when I first saw that, I was like, what, why haven't I seen this all over
817220	822900	Twitter? Well, when you actually go into the story, it's a journalist from venture beat has
822900	827540	arrived at the same conclusion that this must be the direction that they're going in, which by the
827540	832900	way, Or something I really hate about social media headline sharing. And this is no, I'm not
832900	836820	faulting tiger claw because it wasn't interesting. It's always nice to hear that somebody's thinking
836820	841700	the same way you do. So I'm not faulting that. Please don't hear that. But, um, it, I, I,
841700	847220	sometimes these gotcha headlines really irritate me. And we're really bad about that in the games
847220	852420	world, especially, but obviously, you know, we've seen it play out in all political and all this
852420	860020	other type of stuff, but, but I digress, um, Xbox going for free multiplayer would be quite
860020	866980	the shift, um, with halo making that maneuver. Does it seem like this is the logical conclusion
866980	872740	that we're going to get to that Xbox gold is going to go away? Um, actually, before I get your answer,
873300	878420	one other thing to kind of file away game pass changed their branding at some point in the past
878420	882500	few days. So there's no longer Xbox game pass or Microsoft game pass. They're just calling
882500	887620	themselves game pass with the Xbox logo. You can see this on their Twitter account, although the
887620	891540	actual name of the Twitter account hasn't changed. And maybe that's because they have to sort
891540	895140	something out. Somebody probably took the other name, but the logo and some of the identity and
895140	901540	that stuff has changed. So it does feel like chess pieces are moving around. I don't, what's your
901540	906500	thoughts? Do you think this is what Microsoft is positioning themselves to do? I still don't know
906500	911380	yet if I, I mean, I, it certainly seems like they're hinting at that's going to be the change.
911380	915700	I would, wouldn't be surprised if maybe just gold goes away and it's all just what games pass.
916260	921380	Um, I'd be interesting to see what goes on there. I don't know if necessarily with this halo
921380	925460	announcement that necessarily indicates that they're going to be going that route with all
925460	929540	games. I just say at the very least, we know now halo's multiplayer is going to be for free,
930100	935860	um, and that they may sell the campaign separately. I think call of duty did something similar,
935860	940740	not, uh, I know they did look like war zone and stuff. That's, um, free to play. So
942100	946260	it may be just staying competitive in the marketplace with what's out there right now.
946260	951060	Um, I think that they're going to make that announcement at some point soon,
951060	955460	but very right now they haven't confirmed it. Very interesting comment from mr. 2, 100,
955460	960740	Matt, everything's got a price. I'm waiting for the catch here. Could there be a catch,
960740	967780	you know, I could definitely see where maybe while you're in matchmaking lobbies for, um,
967780	972980	certain games, they're going to be a little more. And again, I am, I am completely fantasized. I'm
972980	976820	kind of reading into this comment and going, I could see this happening. That maybe you're
976820	981460	going to see advertisements and matchmaking lobbies. And so, I mean, heck we, it's not like
981460	986420	we haven't seen advertisements inserted into games before we've seen like billboards that change and
986500	993060	so forth, but maybe it would be a little more like less subtle. Like you're gonna see ads,
993060	998340	uh, while you're waiting to play games and it'll be like, this match is brought to you in part by
998340	1002980	Colgate toothpaste, maybe try brushing your teeth. You know, I don't know what's going to happen,
1002980	1009220	but that's gonna, that could be something I could see where Xbox might, you know, it's,
1009220	1013460	it's free, but there's a catch and maybe make a little money there. I don't, what do you,
1013460	1017860	do you think that's a road that could go down? I think that there are some companies that will
1017860	1022500	go down the road EA. Um, but I don't know if necessarily that Microsoft's going to be doing
1022500	1026500	that. I would see that they're probably going to be selling more cosmetic microtransactions
1026500	1033060	and stuff like that. Um, but I think, I mean, really a lot of these companies could probably
1033060	1038420	afford to have multiplayer for free considering how much money they make off of microtransactions.
1038420	1043140	I don't know that necessarily we're going to see ads, but I mean,
1044180	1049300	even if they were charging for multiplayer, I could see them doing ads during like waiting stuff.
1049300	1054020	Yeah. But I mean, and who's to say though, with matchmaking being pretty quick, I don't know,
1054740	1057620	like if you would, I don't know if they would do that though. Like,
1058980	1064100	well, I guess we'll wait and see. Yeah, we'll see. I don't know. Um, uh, a chat name. I don't
1064100	1069300	recognize somebody possibly knew or changed their name who said, uh, called, uh, no one special 77.
1069300	1075060	Hello. No one special, uh, says, uh, possible catch 22. You know how with gold you pay for
1075060	1079700	multiplayer, but they give you games for free. Maybe the game pass you pay for the subscription,
1079700	1084580	but the multiplayer is free, but you need game pass to play. Uh, and you're not the first person
1084580	1088740	that passed them. I wouldn't either. And you're not the first person in chat to suggest that,
1088740	1092820	that maybe halo will be a little taste of that. But ultimately, and I think we've, we've heard
1092820	1098900	the theory of the bundled package that essentially gold turns into game pass and it's everything.
1098900	1103620	And, you know, I get that could, we don't want to assume we, we still have no confirmation for
1103620	1109220	Microsoft on this. We know one game is doing it and it's a big one halo. So that lends itself to
1109220	1113700	the possibility, you know, y'all love the feasibility scale on this show, right? So,
1113700	1117700	or I'm sorry, it was plausible, uh, the plausibility scale, right? So it was a plausible
1117700	1121140	Microsoft's going to throw it out for all games. Well, with, with them doing it for halo, it's
1121140	1126340	certainly plausible, but, um, is it going to be a bundled thing either? And halo is just a taste.
1126340	1133060	I don't know. I kind of think Microsoft's bread and butter now is game pass. They want to be
1133620	1139620	Netflix for games before someone else beats them to it because Microsoft so many times in the
1139620	1144340	industry has had to be playing catch up a little bit by trying to catch up to what somebody else
1144340	1148340	has done. Microsoft is like, dang it. We're going to be the Netflix of the games industry.
1148340	1152980	This is what we're doing. So I think what's going to happen when Microsoft goes to sell halo and
1152980	1159700	the ads are on TV and all this stuff, they're not going to say $60 in store now or, uh, pre-order
1159700	1165380	now they're going to say, get game pass to experience halo on day one. They're going to only
1165380	1171780	push the game on game pass in their official advertising channels and the $60 retail. That's
1171780	1178420	a footnote now. That's where I think they go with it, but that's again, just reading the tea leaves.
1179540	1184820	Jamie, you think it's possible that they go this direction as well, um, to, uh, still making you
1184820	1189940	pay for multiplayer, but it's like a game pass combo pack. Yeah. I think that's what they're
1189940	1194180	going to do. And on top of that, I mean, if they had like a completely free option, then yeah,
1194180	1199780	I think there would be like some sponsorship in there. Like, you know, you, I don't know,
1199780	1204420	like something's going to limit it. Like if you want the full package, you have to have the,
1204420	1210820	the full deal, you know, like the, the pass, does that make sense? Oh yeah. Yeah, it does. So they
1210820	1216580	might, they might give a promised free, sorry, this wigs in my eyes. Um, they might give you
1216580	1225140	like that promised free, but free always costs something when the game, you know, when the game
1225220	1231300	companies are involved. As, as somebody in chat said earlier, ain't nothing free in this world,
1231300	1239540	baby. You get Corona for free. Okay. Um, so let me ask one more question. So let's talk about
1239540	1243620	what it might set the stage with competitively. I'm going to ask this question of chat. I'm going
1243620	1250420	to ask this question of my host. So how competitive of a move does this end up being against Sony and
1250420	1256580	Nintendo? Like if, if Microsoft really does go this direction, do you think Sony and Nintendo,
1256580	1260980	and especially it's very interesting in Nintendo's perspective because Nintendo was kind of late to
1260980	1267860	the party and charging for online. And, but, but I don't know, like I, my personal gut kind of says,
1267860	1273460	but Nintendo kind of always gets away with doing whatever the hell they want because their games
1273460	1279460	are so strong and Nintendo is the best developer in the business. And it's pretty convenient. They
1279460	1285460	build their own hardware. So, um, but do you think this move has a competitive, especially
1285460	1290980	when it comes to Sony, do you think it's going to put pressure on Sony to eliminate their online
1290980	1296740	costs as well? Or is Sony going to say, well, we're giving you a better value because blah, blah,
1296740	1301780	blah, blah, whatever excuse they come up with. I have a thought about that. And it's typically
1301780	1308580	that not everybody is a multi-system owner, you know, like maybe we can swing having multiple
1308580	1314020	systems, even though I don't have, you know, the newer Xboxes. Uh, but you know, when you come
1314020	1319060	down to it, a lot of families are going to be a one console house, or if they have something,
1319060	1324580	it's going to be a few generations old, or they've traded it in to buy whatever the new one. So
1326180	1331380	going on that, I don't really think that Sony will have to do something like that.
1331380	1336660	They'll still make their money. They may offer like more incentives for their paid services,
1337300	1341540	but I don't really see that they would see a point in doing it. I don't think it would
1341540	1345300	really frighten them. Hmm. Loki, any thoughts?
1347540	1350900	I mean, they're going to say whatever they want. Nintendo probably be like, well, we offered a,
1350900	1356180	you know, library of games, you know, first or I don't know. I think Nintendo isn't even going to
1356180	1362420	care what they do. I can see Sony having to, um, counteract this with some sort of, uh, offering
1362420	1368340	of PlayStation now for free, um, or at least including it with the price that you play for
1368340	1374660	PlayStation plus, obviously, if there's a big discrepancy between the number of consoles being
1374660	1380660	sold by platform, um, if it's in Sony's favor, I doubt that they're going to, you know, counter
1380660	1386260	with, you know, putting out and they may even not in the beginning because they feel that they're,
1386260	1391780	you know, they've got such a strong lead in the console space already, but if it becomes a point
1391780	1396420	where they need to be competitive, then they would probably offer it up as well. Um, I think
1396420	1402020	it's a good move for Microsoft to be doing this in the first place. If anything, if it gets us to,
1402020	1408100	you know, at least give more value to, um, what you get each month. Cause I know with Microsoft,
1408100	1414420	even as it is already, you get four games a month, you know, with Xbox live gold versus the two,
1415460	1418820	maybe three, if they're feeling generous that month from Sony.
1418820	1422820	So Sony's already kind of even backed down on what they used to give you. They used to
1422820	1427460	get a ton of PSP and place it in three games and stuff like that. Um, it'd be nice if all
1427460	1432740	that was compatible with like PlayStation now. And that was just a free service, but it's not. So
1434420	1439300	I think, yeah, I think they need, the industry needs a kick in the pants and, um, this would
1439300	1444420	definitely help with it. Uh, DJ Rama S in chat says, I don't think Sony is going to care until
1444420	1450740	they start losing sales to Microsoft. So maybe Sony is kind of maybe, you know, these types of
1450740	1456260	plans are years in development. So Sony might be marching forward because they didn't see this
1456260	1459620	disruption in the industry potentially. And again, we don't know there's going to be disruption.
1459620	1464660	It's one game that is, is reading into the tea leaves, but if there is disruption,
1464660	1469860	Sony maybe didn't foresee it coming. And so maybe they don't have a response right away.
1469860	1475380	And it's not until they potentially lose share to Microsoft that they're going to respond to it.
1475380	1482340	But maybe Sony in a very similar way to Nintendo rests on the strength of their first party games
1482340	1488020	to carry them through. Sony does have some very strong first party titles, obviously between,
1488020	1493780	you know, the God of Wars, the horizons and et cetera, et cetera. I can go on. Um, Microsoft
1493780	1499140	has always lagged behind in that department, right? But, and this is a big but, Teehee,
1500500	1505700	Microsoft is really trying to change that from all the studios they've acquired and from what
1505700	1511300	they showed you in this last presentation. This whole presentation that Microsoft did
1511300	1516500	this past month, I don't think was just about being a giant advertisement for Game Pass.
1516500	1523220	That was pretty good, but it's also definitely trying to say, hey, we have great first party
1523220	1532340	titles too. Like Fable coming back, like Forza, like, you know, these new IPs coming from Obsidian
1532340	1536260	and, you know, and then Psychonauts 2 and so on and so on. You guys get the picture, you know,
1536260	1540900	Microsoft is really trying to compete on that level as well. So it's going to be very interesting.
1540900	1545860	And I feel like a lot of gamers are, are at some point going to have to end up with three systems.
1545860	1551220	Well, maybe not because again, Microsoft's games are all PC as well. So I think there's a lot of
1551220	1557220	people that go, I'll just play those games on PC. I'll get Game Pass on PC and play my games there.
1557220	1564420	Well, is that really a loss for Microsoft? No, not if you end up with a Game Pass PC subscription.
1565700	1571780	So Bobby was saying in a chat there that obviously with, you know, the lack of, you know,
1571780	1577620	a subscription for these Xbox Live Gold and stuff, it's like, who's paying for these online services?
1577620	1581380	I think honestly what they've done is they looked at the amount of money that they're,
1581380	1586820	you know, charging each month for Xbox Live Gold. So say, I think it ends up being, you know, like
1586820	1591540	60 bucks a year or so. So like maybe almost like five bucks a month, maybe even more than that now.
1591540	1599060	And they look at offering this, you know, say this library of games out there as is and the amount of
1599060	1604020	money that they might make off of these microtransactions through these games. So if it's not
1604020	1608500	necessarily first party, it could be third party games that they're getting a cut, you know, from
1608500	1615460	those purchases as well. And that may be enough to offset the cost of paying that five dollars a
1615460	1621140	month as it is. And they in fact, maybe making more money from that. So that's why I think they're
1621140	1626340	allowing folks to have access to more games because it gives them more opportunity to spend money.
1626340	1630180	And that's kind of even what we see from like Activision stuff. They're saying they're making
1630180	1637540	billions of dollars off of just microtransactions alone and not necessarily game sales. So obviously
1637540	1643300	if they open that market up to more people to have exposure to these games, there's a better
1643300	1647860	opportunity to make more money than they would say just charging the subscription service. Plus it
1647860	1656500	looks better. In my opinion, it's an investment type of thing. Microsoft does this now so that
1656500	1661620	two, three years down the line, when everybody gets used to Game Pass, Game Pass is a standard.
1661620	1666020	There's so many games now, all these first party developers have put their games out on Game Pass,
1666020	1671460	that there's so much more strength to it, that then they jack up the price by another four
1671460	1676260	dollars a month, just like Netflix did. Because remember when Netflix did the whole quickster
1676260	1682740	thing and then that was like, everybody screamed, they kind of ended up doing it anyway. They just
1682740	1686980	called it different things. And they ended up being able to jack up the price of Netflix while
1686980	1691140	they were at it, because everybody was just so used to it at that point. And there's,
1691140	1695460	oh, we're gonna charge an extra dollar or two for HD. Oh, we're in charge, or I'm sorry, not HD,
1695460	1700580	but 4k, you know, all this other stuff. I, you know, and again, I might be a little bit cynical
1700580	1706420	in that line of thinking. But investment, I think, is a reasonable answer to that question
1706420	1710420	on how do you pay for it, is that you hope long term you're going to come out ahead.
1712820	1720020	So, all right. So, interesting perspective on is what Microsoft's doing working. Pele
1720020	1724900	Hanuman in chat says, it's working. My number one priority after getting a PlayStation 5 is getting
1724900	1730660	a next gen Xbox. It's very true. SSG100Matt says, that's a good point. Rob is saying,
1730660	1735220	for free now, but charge higher later. Ain't nothing in this world free, baby.
1736180	1742900	That's anything. I mean, more than any service. Yeah. All right. And it comes down to also,
1742900	1746100	though, I doubt that I don't think that they would do that right away if they did.
1747300	1752500	It comes down to competition as well, what the competition is doing. So, I don't know,
1752500	1756420	I think that it's still too early to say that's what they're going to do. Have they really done
1756420	1762260	that with I mean, they did that with the Xbox Live Gold, but I think that's once if I remember
1762260	1768420	correctly, they raised the price on that. But there's still the free games that they added to
1768420	1774100	that as well. So, I don't know. We'll see. I mean, again, a lot of this is speculative.
1774100	1780740	So, I'm going to move on, try to get some other less rumor topics discussed on the show. But
1780740	1783860	I think it's very interesting. You know, again, this all plays into what is that, you know, kind
1783860	1789780	of carrying over from last week's kickoff show. What does that next generation of gaming really
1789780	1795060	look like? You know, and all this is going to really impact that. So, on what we look back on
1795060	1800420	Gen, what are we going into now? Generation 8 of sorts, I think, with games. Although,
1800420	1804340	Nintendo being the disrupter is kind of like, I don't know, where are they at? They're like
1804340	1810980	seven and a half. I don't know. Anyway. All right. Let's move on. Let's talk about what generation
1810980	1815460	of games are you playing this week in our gaming weeks? And the types of video games that you have
1815460	1818820	been spending your time playing this week. Darsakha, we'll start with you. How was your
1818820	1824980	gaming week? It was fairly productive. Hold on. Because I took a picture of some of the other
1824980	1829380	stuff that I took to remind myself. So, not only, of course, I'm having a crap load of
1829380	1833140	Animal Crossing, which I will be getting at seven o'clock so I can watch the fireworks.
1833140	1837700	Just saying. Seven o'clock. I should have had you try to set up your Discord so you could switch to
1837700	1841700	your game image so we could see that. But I guess all the East Coasters are already enjoying the
1841700	1846340	fireworks. I've seen it on Twitter. Yeah. I don't know how to, I'd have to take some time and switch
1846420	1853220	that up anyway. Yeah, I know. But we had some, well, I've had like my second visitor ever
1853220	1858180	during the quarantine of my own and it was Becky and she brought Juliana over. He's gotten big.
1858180	1867220	He's playing Sekiro. So, and Dark Souls and he's really going for it. But he and Dan were playing
1867220	1874900	Mario Kart 8 Deluxe yesterday. And it was pretty amusing to listen to them banter. And we also
1874900	1882100	have the Capcom beat-em-up bundle. You know, Knights of the Round, King of Dragons, you know,
1882980	1889380	Captain Commando, a few other games on there. They're really fun. I mean, it's not like we
1889380	1894580	don't have some of these on other collections, but it's nice to have access to them, especially
1894580	1899620	the one that's semi-related to cyberbots. But for the life of me, I can't remember. It's like
1899620	1905460	Armored something, Armored Warrior, not Armored Core. But at any rate, we had a lot of fun with
1905460	1913060	that. And then we also got the Outrun Sega Ages collection. So it has a bunch of music in it just
1913060	1924740	all over and different kinds of trials in the game. It's pretty fun. And I briefly mentioned
1924740	1932020	it last week, but I also have the Sega Ages, Sega Saturn Fantasy Zone. And now I'm looking for a
1932020	1937860	copy of Black Matrix for the Sega Saturn. So if someone wants to eBay that for me, that would be
1937860	1945300	great. I need to find a translation of it though. But yeah, that's been a little pinball. We
1945300	1953940	reorganized the front room. It's just been kind of up in the air, but now we have our vault kind
1953940	1963140	of reset as a proper game room. And we're playing Lethal Enforcers on the Genesis with the Justifier.
1963140	1966340	I really want to come over and play pinball at some point, but pandemic.
1967300	1972980	So, well, if you, you know, if the both of us haven't been around people for, you know.
1972980	1977140	Yeah, I got all that stuff. All that stuff. My dad's going on though. It's got to take priority.
1977140	1983540	So I get it. I get it. And I'm pissed off at Dan cause he had people over in the garage and
1983540	1990020	I had to go in there with a Lysol spray and just spray the air. I mean, this was actually pretty,
1990020	1996660	pretty effective, but thankfully Dan stayed away for a little while and, and washed his hands and
1996660	2002660	washed himself really well. I was already passed out, so I couldn't be mad last night, but yeah,
2002660	2008260	we we've got game-age going on and more than there was a week before. So nah.
2008820	2011380	All right. Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?
2011780	2016420	Um, so I did play a few things, uh, a lot of Minecraft this week, as usual,
2016420	2021540	both of my kids wanted me to build them mansions. So I had to build two modern mansions for them,
2022180	2027140	you know, just the small things here. We want a four story mansion, please. You know, can you,
2027140	2032660	can you give me one? Dad, my requests are not unreasonable. All I want is a four story mansion,
2033540	2039460	dad, make it happen. Exactly. So I did that. And then, um,
2040260	2048820	I did play a little bit of a Paper Mario in the Origami King and I beat the first boss in that
2048820	2054020	game. Uh, and then they have, I guess the first like kind of mini boss and then like the first
2054020	2060420	boss in the game. And, uh, if, for those who may not know the games, bosses are, um, it's
2060420	2068980	stationary stuff. So, um, the first boss has a pack of colored pencils and it's fantastic.
2069780	2074340	I really love that game, uh, just in the art style and everything. So, um, pretty cool.
2074900	2078980	And then a little bit of Orna, just the bare minimum. I really haven't been playing too much
2078980	2084900	of that. Just doing, you know, my daily wars and whatnot. Uh, get on those wars. Cause you know,
2084900	2090020	your kingdom master's a Dick when it comes to those wars, but we were losing too many by like
2090020	2093620	a hair. And so we don't want to get matched against big guilds if we don't have active
2093620	2101620	people. So, yeah. So, um, doing that and then, yeah, that's pretty much it. It's just, uh,
2101620	2107380	those, those few games. Awesome. Uh, by the way, speaking of Orna, since that was a little bit of
2107380	2112180	my game, we too, they did a big update today. Uh, and there's like the, it runs a lot smoother.
2112180	2115380	Like I feel like I'm getting a better frame rate and they put some new fonts in it. So it looks
2115380	2118340	kind of, it looks a little more, it looks a little different. It doesn't look completely
2118340	2121700	retro now. It's gonna, the sprites haven't changed though. So it's still got a retro feel,
2121700	2125700	but you have to check it out. Um, anyway, other stuff in my gaming week, I've also been playing
2125700	2130100	animal crossing. I've had a lot of turnaround in my village in the last two weeks. I've
2130100	2136420	lost three villagers and gained three new ones. So, um, I, um, I let Gigi go, she has to go,
2136420	2142180	well, I lost Nana like about three weeks ago and I got Klaus who has a hilarious house because he
2142180	2146180	lives in what looks like a bath house. Cause it's supposed to be like a throw to like ancient Greece
2146260	2150740	and that's kind of like his aesthetic. So, um, and he's great. I like him for a smug type. He,
2150740	2156020	uh, him and I get along. Uh, and then I lost Gigi. She asked to leave. Uh, and I was like,
2156020	2160100	all right, you're a duplicate typing. So, uh, she left and I got a normal type to replace,
2160100	2164740	uh, Nana who I didn't care for. Uh, and I got, uh, Norma, Norma, the normal.
2166420	2173620	I love how some of the names are completely like I have Marshall. Yeah. I, I, I went Islander
2173620	2179220	hunting yesterday and I found a villager named Snooty and I was like, I wonder what type of
2179220	2185620	villager this one is. I let Julian go so I could bring Marshall in. Oh wow.
2187620	2192580	I can get him back anytime. Oh, somebody or anybody's Island because we haven't
2192580	2198020	been to anyone. We need more fruit because my wife wants to build out her orchard. Yes.
2198020	2202100	My wife has basically taken over the entire Island and completely decorated everything
2202100	2207140	because I don't play that game very much. Um, so she's redesigned everything, but yeah,
2207140	2210740	she needs to visit some more islands too, or I should say I need to visit the islands because
2210740	2216420	I have the Xbox or the Nintendo pass. Um, Jamie and I both have all the fruits,
2216420	2223700	so visit one of us and you'll be set. All right, cool. Cool. Um, let's see. So, um, the,
2223700	2229940	the hardest change I made into my villager lineup was I got Judy as a camper this week and I really
2229940	2233780	wanted her because I'm like, she's kind of like different, right? She's newer for this one and
2233780	2237300	she's got a really cute look. She's like a starry eyed bear and I know she's really popular. So I
2237300	2242100	was like, all right, Judy. And I had to talk to her a bunch of times and the first villager Judy
2242100	2247940	wanted to boot was catch up. And I was like, ah, and I instantly turned off the game and restarted
2247940	2251460	it. If her said he was here, he would have screamed at me, but you can get away with it.
2252180	2258820	So finally I settled on, she asked to kick rocket and I let her do it. And that was hard because
2259060	2264340	rocket was one of my first two villagers though. So I was really attached to her. And so that was
2264340	2270500	really hard. Yeah. But you know, Apple was my third and I booted her the fuck out. Here's the
2270500	2275140	thing. Part of the game is turnaround. And you know, it's kind of one of those things. I was
2275140	2279540	like, you know what? I can't hang on to the same 10 villagers forever or there, the game is not
2279540	2284820	going to be interesting. So I had to let rocket go and rocket had an OG house for that reason too,
2284820	2287940	because you know, they don't really get their personalized furniture. If they're one of your
2287940	2294180	first two villagers. So I let Judy replace rocket. That was hard. And then the same day Judy moves
2294180	2300100	in, I have another villager, Joey, who asked to leave and he was a duplicate typing, lazy type.
2300100	2306980	So I just picked up boots, another jock, who's a really cute alligator. And I was like, okay,
2306980	2311700	I'll take that. So yeah, that's as the animal crossing island turns, but I'm also excited to
2311700	2315060	check out the fireworks show, but yeah, I've had a lot of turnover on my island this week.
2315860	2320980	Um, other games I've been playing besides just that continued GPS stuff still doing,
2320980	2325700	you know, Ingress, Pokemon Go, that stuff keeps me moving. Thanks to actdeft if you're out there
2325700	2329300	listening tonight, because he invited me to a remote raid and I caught a Rayquaza yesterday
2329300	2335060	that was kind of random. Some people just if they see me on they send me a remote raid and I try to
2335060	2340020	do them if I see them. But there is sometimes a lag and I get sent invites where it's like,
2340020	2343860	I'd already closed the game Niantic must not have shown that I went offline. So I'd already closed
2343860	2349940	it. So yeah, but I love I'm loving the remote rating, that's for sure. And then a new game that
2349940	2354660	I checked out this week was thanks to Xbox Game Pass, they just added a game called The Tourist,
2354660	2361540	but it's spelled, it's like T O U R Y S T or so it's spelled differently. It's interesting because
2361540	2365060	it's kind of like a little bit of a puzzler. And what made me want to play this game is that
2365060	2370820	somebody tweeted that basically there's like a game inside the game. That's basically a
2370820	2377860	Minecraft version of fast racing Neo remix on Nintendo Switch is like kind of inside that game
2377860	2382420	and I thought that was really cool. So I was like, okay, I'm gonna check this game out on Game Pass
2382420	2389460	and the aesthetic is very 3d.game heroes. Do you remember that game for the PS3? It was like one
2389460	2395300	of the early titles. It was like Zelda with a very distinct look. That look is very like this,
2395300	2399940	but it's not really the same type of game because 3d.game heroes was very Zelda inspired.
2399940	2405620	This one is a little more of like a puzzler. I almost in some ways get throwbacks to like
2405620	2410260	Solstice and Equinox, because you got that whole isometric puzzler type of thing,
2410260	2415140	but not quite as actiony, at least not in the early stages I'm still in. A little more puzzle-y
2415140	2421380	than actiony in those games. But yeah, that game's really cool and I want to play more of it. I
2421380	2428100	admittedly did not get far into it, but I played enough. My curiosity, I was like, what happens if
2428100	2432900	I swim way far out past the island? Cause the lifeguard says, don't go too far out or I can't
2432900	2437780	see you. And my brain goes, that means there's treasure there. So I swam out as far as I could
2437780	2441780	and I got eaten by a shark. And that was really funny. Cause the shark just pops out of the water,
2441780	2448500	goes like attacks your character. Yeah, pretty much. It just jumps up.
2449620	2455460	I looked up the, uh, the, um, pictures of it online. It looks, I like the aesthetic of that.
2455460	2460420	Yeah. It's very like Minecraft. In fact, when I was playing it, Alan came in the room and was
2460420	2464100	like, Oh, is this like a Minecraft license game? Is this like a new mine? And I'm like, no, it's
2464100	2468020	not, it's not really related to Minecraft. It just has that aesthetic. And yeah, it really reminded
2468020	2472740	me of 3d.game heroes. It's that whole, like, see the arcade. So they have like multiple arcade
2472740	2477060	games in there. Cause it looks like I haven't gotten to the arcade yet. So I can't tell you
2477060	2483140	it's not in the very first island. It's not in the second island either. So yeah. Yeah. So anyway,
2483700	2488180	I thought it was neat, so I'll play more of it. So, uh, I liked it, but I wanted, I'm like,
2488180	2493140	I got to play something new. I can't just rely on the old standards, but of course I've still been
2493140	2497860	playing lots of final fantasy 14. Like I spend easily an hour and a half every night, but that's
2497860	2503380	just like. Shane and other friends and I running a dungeon or something and just chatting and,
2503380	2508980	you know, just leveling our characters, continuing to level my samurai. Why don't know, just killing
2508980	2514020	time until that next patch. Although the next big content patch for Final Fantasy 14 is next
2514020	2520740	Tuesday, August 11th. So it's fine. This is after a big delay. Final Fantasy 14 has been very good
2520740	2525140	on the content patches. It's like every few months there's a patch, but we've had a really big dry
2525140	2530180	spell between these last two patches, but understandably it's the whole COVID-19 issue
2530180	2534980	that's caused this to be delayed a little bit. So we got to cut them a little bit of slack. So,
2534980	2539460	but I'm excited to check out that new expansion or I'm sorry, new patch. There's no expansion
2539460	2546900	yet. Maybe until next year probably. Okay. Let's move on and get into some gaming news. Oh,
2546900	2551780	actually one other thing I should talk about, or I'm going to get an angry phone call later
2551780	2557940	in the show. One thing that was kind of my gaming week, I backed a Kickstarter this week
2557940	2565540	and it was that Iodine Chronicle 100 Heroes that I actually ended up backing. And after Shane
2565540	2569380	reminded me every day, did you back it yet? Did you back it yet? Did you back it yet? I'm like,
2569380	2575540	yes, God, leave me alone. So, but I won. I really do want it. So, cause I, I enjoyed Suikoden and I,
2575540	2582020	the little trailer that they're showing for the new one looked really good. So, yeah.
2582820	2589220	Um, I backed that and, um, I'll be excited to play that game in two years,
2589220	2594180	but apparently the Kickstarter is doing very well. Um, by the time I backed it, it was up to like
2594180	2598820	somewhere around 2.4, 2.5 million. I don't know. It's probably gone up even higher.
2598820	2602980	Um, and they're starting to release a lot of the, um, stretch rewards. Like it's going to
2602980	2607140	come to consoles. They've hit that. They're starting to add new characters. They're hitting
2607140	2611620	all of these. There's some additional localizations they're putting in. So the Kickstarter is doing
2611780	2617220	very, very well. Some may even, I mean, it depends who you talk to. Some may say better than expected.
2617220	2624260	Some may say, uh, you know, we knew Suikoden fans wanted this for a long time. So you gotta wonder
2624260	2629380	if Konami is sitting there going, well, shit, maybe we should have got on this sooner, but
2629380	2633460	Konami as a company has been mismanaged for how many years? So, you know, what can you do?
2633460	2638180	Uh, very happy for the developers that they get to make another, a spiritual successor of sorts. And
2638260	2645300	I'm excited to check it out. Um, all right, let's move on and talk about some of the news from the
2645300	2649860	week. And, uh, Loki, let's talk about this one. This is a big one that's got everybody talking,
2649860	2654660	right? Yeah. So we kind of talked a little bit about like some of the stuff that leaked out
2654660	2660980	about this huge gig leak. So basically there was a bunch of Nintendo development stuff that got
2660980	2666660	leaked out a while back. Um, I'm not sure if this is separate from the last huge leak that we had,
2666660	2675060	but this is definitely, uh, same leak trickling out the information and parsing. Yeah. Yes. So
2675060	2680660	a lot of development stuff, there is a lot of source code for different games and whatnot. So
2680660	2686420	some of the things of note to mention out of the leak. So one of the things that was in there was
2686420	2692260	the source code for star Fox two, which has recently got put on to of course the classic,
2692260	2697780	uh, SNES console. And I believe now is also part of the Nintendo online,
2697780	2703300	a collection of games, character designs though. Yes. As the character design. So they had a lot
2703300	2708100	of different character designs, something that necessarily go with, but there was one that was,
2708100	2713540	um, a human character as well, a pilot, a black female that was in there. They also had a bunch
2713540	2717780	of different animal pilots as well, that, uh, all sorts of different animals. It kind of reminds me
2717860	2722260	a little bit of a Zootopia a little bit, uh, but lots of different designs that they had,
2722260	2726660	uh, toyed with, but didn't end up going with, uh, some of the other cool stuff.
2726660	2733700	They had different character design for Luigi for super Mario world. Um, speaking of Luigi,
2733700	2741780	they had art assets for Luigi in, um, Mario 64, but obviously unused as well. Um,
2741780	2749060	with no L on his hat. Right. Right. Yes. Yeah. And then, um, there was a bunch of other random
2749060	2753540	assets. They had some early art assets from super Mario carts, which actually had looked like a
2753540	2758740	human player in there instead of the Mario stuff. I could maybe see them doing like some sort of
2758740	2765780	like, uh, I don't know, uh, maybe using it as a prototype to build everything else out. Also,
2765780	2771060	they had the cart was, they had a version that was a hovercraft as well, instead of just a regular,
2771060	2777300	uh, cart. Oh, huh. Uh, yeah, that's kind of neat. That would work for that aesthetic of game too.
2777300	2780340	I didn't even really think of that. I didn't, I didn't pick up on that one. I saw the Mario
2780340	2786020	cart with the different music. I heard that and the original music. It wasn't, it seemed a little
2786020	2792980	like maybe dreamy and sad for a Mario cart game, but I liked it. I sure did. Yeah. What about the
2792980	2798500	animal crossing stuff? Yes, the animal crosses stuff. So animal, Jamie's like, get to the good
2798500	2804740	shit, wrap it up, wrap it up, get to what I want to hear. Apparently, and for animal forest, uh,
2804740	2810900	there was art assets for blathers as one of the animals in the game and he wasn't in the game yet.
2811460	2815860	No, he was not. So that'd be cool if you could get blathers as one of your villagers.
2815860	2824900	Uh, also there was, I believe our assets for caddy for caddy. Yeah, caddy. She looks pretty terrible,
2824980	2830100	but those brows, you know? Yes. And then, um, I want to say they were also talking about,
2830100	2834340	it possibly is going to be human characters as well in there. So that was kind of neat.
2834340	2838660	I think it was some of the MPCs like there was, they were going to have more like MPC humans,
2839860	2844180	but there was something cool though about when they leaked the source code for that,
2844180	2850100	it had the emulator source code in it too. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a big, big thing.
2851060	2855460	Yeah. Lots of emulator source codes. I know they also had, uh, like official emulators,
2855460	2861780	um, that were from the DS as well that were leaked with that. Um, lots of information.
2861780	2864420	I think it's going to be a while before they finally go through all of this,
2864980	2871140	but it is interesting. I understand that ethically it's not great, but I like always seeing all this
2871140	2875220	development stuff and kind of what could have been, and you know, what stuff looked like at
2875220	2880580	one point and just learning a bit more from that. Um, it'd be pretty cool to see what they
2880580	2886340	do with this plus within the Luigi stuff in there and the leaked version of the source code for
2887220	2893860	Mario 64 that they've now gotten to run on PC. Um, I would be curious to see that. Oh,
2893860	2898260	I guess that's not necessarily the source code that it was a rebuilding of that. Um,
2898260	2902420	I wonder if they can incorporate the Luigi stuff in there as well. That'd be pretty cool.
2902420	2908980	I mean, granted, I think, uh, the Nintendo 64 or not, the DS version of Mario 64 had some
2908980	2914100	multiplayer in there as well, but, um, it'd be interesting to see what they are able to do with
2914100	2919060	this. And then the most random one thing I saw there was someone pointing out that there was
2919060	2928180	a textures for, uh, Beavis from Beavis and Butthead and, uh, F zero X. I don't know. There's a lot of
2928180	2931940	like weird stuff that they used to like put placeholder in there. Um, I know there's like a
2931940	2939060	place that way. So, um, let me, I gotta, I have to bring this point out because our chat, our chat is
2939060	2942900	getting into it here. I know there's plenty more to talk about, but you know, a very real point
2942900	2947460	here from Bobby in our chat room saying the thing about this whole story is that sucks is that this
2947460	2951860	is corporate theft. I know it's interesting, but we're celebrating corporate theft here.
2951860	2956100	I don't know if celebrate is the word I would use. Like, this is one of the things we're like,
2956100	2960980	it happened, we didn't do it, but it's out there now. And it's, you know, we're all kind of like
2960980	2967060	looking into it. Um, it's kind of like the Sony pictures, email leaks. Like that was a crime
2967060	2972740	that was theft or, you know, it's not like we rated the Parthenon and stole, you know,
2972740	2977300	Greek architecture from it like a hello British museum. And to be fair, to be fair, I don't think
2977300	2980660	Bobby is like saying, you guys shouldn't talk about it because everybody's talking about it.
2980660	2985700	So I think when he says that he means like we, as the, you know, gaming fans are sitting here,
2985700	2989700	like diving into this going, Ooh, isn't this fascinating? Ooh, this is cool. But I mean,
2989700	2995940	at the end of the day, it's stolen shit. Like this is not stuff that was meant for public eyes,
2995940	3001780	you know, and, and now this has another quandary out there. Do you, can you count this as gaming
3001780	3009540	history or should stuff that was sent to the trash be private? I don't know. It's, it is a
3009540	3015220	moral dilemma and not one I'm sure we can easily answer here on OLR. Um, and this is one that I
3015300	3020740	think a lot of historians are struggling with right now because yeah, like Luigi and Mario 64,
3020740	3027300	that's huge, but that was put in the bin. It wasn't supposed to ever be found. These character
3027300	3032500	designs for Star Fox 2, again, another great example. Yeah, the pilot designs all looked
3032500	3037060	awesome, but the reality is they're not real. You know, you know what I mean? When I say that,
3037060	3041140	right? They're not real because they didn't get to that finish line in the game. And you even have
3041140	3046660	some designers going like, wow, I kind of like forgot about all that stuff. So like, I don't
3046660	3052820	know, like there's that part of me that's like, ah, I wish Nintendo, you know, okay, make lemons
3052820	3058980	out of lemonade. Like this, this happened. It's unfortunate. It sucks. This happened,
3060020	3067380	but maybe the silver lining here. And I'm kind of going back to an old adage that I think of,
3067700	3072740	you know, I love my drag queens. And I think it was Alaska was the drag queen that said,
3072740	3076100	you know, if they're going to drag you over the internet about it, put it on a t-shirt and sell
3076100	3080500	it. And that's kind of the thing I'm giving, that's the advice I'm giving to Nintendo here.
3080500	3085540	You know what? This sucks that this happened, but maybe it shows that there's like people
3085540	3091860	are drooling and salivating for a little more of this gaming history here. So why not put out an
3091860	3098100	app on the switch, charge $1.99 for it and start filling it slowly with videos, kind of looking
3098100	3104020	back and basically selling people some of the information that's in this leak that's already
3104020	3110740	out there anyway. And Nintendo can do this. They did this on the 3DS with that video app that they
3110740	3115220	slowly populated with the Dino office every other week and all that stuff, right? So Nintendo could
3115220	3118900	kind of like do that and like, oh, and this one, we're going to look back on the design of Mario
3118900	3123700	Kart and how it got from here to there. And, you know, yes, I understand Nintendo wanted to keep
3123700	3129940	it secret. Nintendo didn't want this out there as well. Well, it happened. So yeah, like make a buck
3129940	3136580	off it or something. I love that watching those GDC or the GDC talks where they do kind of like
3136580	3140900	a post-mortem of different games and talking about the development process and like some of
3140900	3145540	the decisions that they made and stuff. I always find that stuff to be very fascinating. So I would
3145540	3154340	love to hear about some of this stuff. Like the Yoshi iterations, like first Yoshi was kind of a
3154340	3159540	hideous freak. The fun thing is that if you know some of the developmental history of some of these
3159540	3164260	games, you're actually looking back at that point in history, like the little human writers that
3164260	3171220	were in Mario Kart were actually just placeholders for a different kart game that it was going to be.
3171220	3177460	So, I mean, that's really all that those were. There was a, I think I did, you know, gaming about that.
3177460	3184900	But for me, I know it actually, I guess, kind of semi makes up for something that I got really
3184900	3191540	pissed off about. The channel that does Boundary Break had a boundary break for
3191540	3195700	Animal Crossing and Nintendo took it down. And I have a feeling that since the guy published through,
3195700	3201140	I think he published through Final Cut, if you publish directly from the app, then if the video
3201140	3207940	is taken down, they can actually take your assets. So for me, this is kind of like getting a little
3207940	3214100	bit back, at least on something older to see how it's put together. I mean, Rob can vouch for this.
3214100	3219940	How many times did I post like behind the scenes stuff for World of Warcraft? You know, when I got
3219940	3224580	my demon hunter, I was breaking that shit all the time. You know, I like to see what's behind the
3224580	3232660	scenes. And this for me, it's old. The assets are old. I don't know that, especially for the
3232660	3237940	old Animal Crossings, I don't know if we're going to be getting Animal Forest E Plus as a rerelease
3237940	3243220	anytime soon. Just saying. I don't feel, I don't feel that bad about it. I really don't feel that
3243220	3250020	bad about it. So it's a Pandora's box type of issue. But the reality is it's been open and it's
3250020	3256580	out there now. So you know, and I, the information is out there. So, you know, I, again, I kind of
3256580	3264020	land on what I hope Nintendo kind of can do is take this kind of bad situation and lean into it
3264020	3269620	a little bit and sort of go, all right, well, if it's out there, then let's try to put some context
3269620	3275140	to it and sell that and make money off of it. Because otherwise the information is just floating
3275140	3279380	around out there. And they'd be naive to think they're going to shut down every YouTube and
3279380	3283380	everything out there on the internet. Although y'all should be warned, they're going to try.
3283380	3288180	And that's, you'll notice why I don't have any of this on display right now. We can talk about it.
3288180	3296020	It's news, but I, I'm not putting it on screen, just in case, which I, at the end, I seriously
3296020	3303460	doubt Nintendo would come after this, but, you know, why, why, why risk it? So it's, it's out
3303460	3308900	there. If you, if you want to go look and you arrive at that moral conclusion that you can go
3308900	3318580	look, then it's very easy to do. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I, I'm curious. That being said,
3318580	3325380	I'm still very curious about more stuff to come out. So let me see more things. Show me more,
3325380	3331460	more things that you find. I just saw one. It was the, a test model for the Super FX chip that was
3331460	3338900	link. I mean, a very low poly version of link that like is something you would see. Well,
3338900	3343540	obviously during that era, but, um, it was still pretty cool and they got to import it into
3343540	3348580	Starbucks to be able to see it. Yeah. I'm kind of like, I'm I'm for me, I'm kind of like, it is,
3348580	3353700	it is fascinating, but it does feel really dirty. Like it, it definitely feels like it's dirty.
3353700	3357700	And I think the thing that would set me off, which thankfully I haven't seen on my Twitter feed,
3357700	3362820	maybe I'm curating it very well. Um, is I think if somebody were to say, well, that looks like
3362820	3367940	garbage. I can't believe Nintendo was doing that. I would probably pop off on that because you
3367940	3373940	weren't supposed to see it. So don't go given that negative context to it. You know, it was put in
3373940	3378980	the bin for a reason or whatever. So luckily I'm not seeing that at least on my feed, but it's the
3378980	3383860	internet. I'm sure it's out there somewhere. Um, because there's so much negativity, unfortunately,
3383860	3387860	sometimes in gamer circles, I'm sure there are people that are using this information to pick
3387860	3394340	on Nintendo. And that is, that is very unacceptable, like beyond unacceptable in my opinion.
3394340	3399380	Um, but it's one of those things where I'm kind of like, it happened, we can't change it. We can't
3399380	3406100	unput the information on the internet. Um, I hope Nintendo will try to embrace it and make the best
3406100	3412020	out of it that they can. So, yeah. All right. Well, let's move on. Let's talk about, let's
3412020	3416500	talk about some things that, um, maybe in the future, let's talk about less about gaming's
3416500	3421620	past and look more at gaming's future for something that may be a part of the PlayStation
3421620	3428340	five. Uh, and one of those features is the potential of an activity button. Uh, and this
3428340	3435940	is coming from, uh, a European outlet named game reactor who did a preview of a racing game, WRC
3435940	3440980	nine, uh, which is going to be launching on the current gen like PlayStation four, Xbox one, as
3440980	3446660	well as the next gen PlayStation five. Now, as part of the presentation, there was an activities
3446660	3452500	function that was demonstrated described as an instant deep link to specific races directly from
3452500	3458740	the PlayStation five's menu. There was even a tweet about it that said, uh, or features such
3458740	3464340	as PS five's activities feature in parentheses, an instant deep link to specific races directly from
3464340	3468100	the console's menu. I pretty much read the same thing twice. Sorry, but that's what it said on
3468100	3475220	the tweet that is now gone. Um, so somebody probably asked for that to get pulled. Um,
3475220	3480580	so this could be a thing that's in PlayStation five's future. Think of it as an, it is kind of
3480580	3484580	one of those things where I was like, really? That's a feature. Just jump right to level two
3484580	3489860	or something. But if you think about it, some games, they take a long time to configure, you
3489860	3494500	know, it's like, okay, press the start money menu to begin loading, loading, loading, loading,
3494980	3499060	select which race you want to do to player, select your vehicle, loading, loading, loading,
3499060	3503380	loading, you know, and then you'll finally, it takes a while and you get into the race.
3504020	3507940	And what if there was a way you could say, you know what, I want to set this up as a shortcut
3507940	3514180	so that I just go right into the action. And I do feel like the speed of playing the game,
3514180	3518820	the speed of getting in there is something that they're really pushing on PlayStation five with
3518820	3523940	their solid state drive, as well as, you know, Xbox series X to an extent as well. You've seen
3523940	3527860	some of the things out there where they've talked about, like, you're going to be able to keep
3527860	3532660	multiple game instances open in the background and kind of jump right to your position in one
3532660	3538340	game or the other. So definitely that speed of jumping right in there is something we're hearing
3538340	3545860	a lot about. So this makes a lot of sense from that perspective. Do you think this is a feature?
3546420	3551300	Does this seem like something that you might actually use in a game? The activities feature,
3551380	3556660	and I asked this of our chat as well, assuming it happens again, this is not confirmed,
3556660	3562580	but something that may be spilled out here. Probably not. You don't think it's true?
3563620	3571860	No. I mean, if it's something that I would use. Oh, sorry. Gotcha. Oh, did you want to elaborate?
3571860	3576980	I'm sorry. No, I just said no. As Joe and Matt says, I find this rather interesting and it fits
3576980	3582500	with Sony really pushing hard for non-existent load times. Yeah, it does kind of fit into that,
3582500	3591700	so it makes a lot of sense. Let me ask this of chat. Is there any game that you can think of
3591700	3597780	where this feature would be really useful? Like, I want to use a feature like this in this game.
3597780	3602500	It could be something that exists today. That's fine. I can think of several ideas for this. So,
3602660	3607940	for example, say you have Call of Duty and you play a lot of Call of Duty or something like that,
3607940	3617140	you could have a link or whatever that says jump to quick match lobby or something like that, where
3617140	3621700	it'll basically just throw you in. You don't have to load the game up, load up multiplayer,
3621700	3628340	load up quick match. It'll just put you straight into that lobby to be able to play that game type.
3628340	3635380	I can see that as a thing. Not so much like, say, oh, I'm pulling up Gran Turismo and I want to
3636340	3640820	race a specific track. I think that's more something that can be implemented software-wise.
3642340	3644660	But, yeah, I can see where there should be some value there.
3646020	3652100	I can definitely see. Sony is working a lot more with trying to kind of push their consoles the
3652100	3656820	definitive place to play Fortnite. You've kind of seen with that investment. I can definitely
3656820	3660980	see. It just seems obvious that you would see something in Fortnite where it's like,
3660980	3665460	jump into Battle Royale default settings just right now. Let's just go. Get on the bus.
3665460	3669780	So, I could see something without having to go through all the other screens and configuration.
3669780	3675780	I could definitely see something like that being, I think, something that'd show off. It would be so
3675780	3682260	requested by people, I bet. I wish they'd have something like it for Final Fantasy XIV, where
3682260	3687700	I could just bypass the login screen. I know I need a password to kind of keep things protected
3687700	3691300	and stuff, but I don't know. I wish there was a way to make that whole process faster. You know
3691300	3696740	what I mean? I just want to jump in the game. Just bring me to my main character or ask me for my
3696740	3702500	two-factor auth password once and let's get in. You know what I mean? Instead of, select your
3702500	3708020	server, select your character. Well, they sort of do like, going back even, they sort of did that
3708020	3714500	way. I mean, granted, not a great example because Grand Theft Auto 5. I mean, that is one of those
3714500	3719700	next-gen games now that we're touting that for PlayStation 5, even though it's been out for a
3719700	3724500	couple generations already. But one of the options that they had there was to be able to load
3724500	3732580	directly into Grand Theft Auto Online, which saves some time because the load times on that are
3732580	3737140	incredibly long. I'm hoping that, obviously, with a solid-state drive that they'll be much faster,
3737140	3741940	but it is something that they kind of had that idea in mind where you could just bypass some of
3741940	3746820	the load screens that way. But if they have this new feature where it's going to load things
3746820	3752580	much faster, then I could definitely see them just having it instantly jump into something like that.
3752580	3758180	That would be pretty cool. SSG100Matt in chat says, I envision it similar to having multiple tabs open
3758180	3762980	in a browser. You could, in theory, have multiple games playing at once and just jump around from
3762980	3768820	game to game, instance to instance, like switching tabs in a browser. My understanding is that is
3768820	3773860	what Microsoft has already talked about for Xbox Series X, is that basically you can have multiple
3773860	3782500	game sessions open. I just think that's kind of a waste. I mean, it wouldn't be anything that I
3782500	3788820	would use. But no, I have ADD. I have to play four games at once, okay? It's fine. Well, I mean,
3789380	3797060	I could kind of see it for myself because I do sometimes jump to like, oh, I just kind of want
3797060	3800500	to see what's on Twitch. Is anybody streaming? Okay, no, nobody's streaming. All right, I'm going
3800500	3803780	to go into this game and I'm going to take care of these things. Okay, now I just want to get into
3803780	3808660	this game. If something like this was on Nintendo Switch, I could see myself like, okay, I just want
3808660	3814180	to jump into Animal Crossing, do some of the tasks on my islands. Okay, I'm done. Let's go into the
3814180	3818580	next game. You know what I mean? And let me pick off where I left off on Xenoblade Chronicles.
3818580	3823780	You know, I could sort of see it, especially if there are games where you have kind of like daily
3823780	3830180	tasks that you go through, if that makes sense. But I can also see that, yeah, I mean, there are
3830180	3836820	features on every console that some people don't ever use them. There's a lot other OS on PlayStation
3836820	3841780	3. There's a lot of people that never used it. There's some people that really freaking miss it.
3841780	3845620	You know, it's just one of those things where different strokes for different folks.
3846340	3853380	So, all right. Yeah, SD100Matt says, I'm bouncing between streaming apps and games all the time.
3853380	3856740	You know, and I'm guilty of this too, is that I'll be playing a video game. Oh, wait, hold on,
3856740	3861540	pause a minute. Check my phone, check my Twitter feed. What's going on? And back to it. Like,
3861540	3865540	I almost think it would be almost more valuable and who knows, maybe this is the direction they'll
3865540	3870900	go, is if I could just hit a button and see the latest posts on my Twitter feed or what the latest
3870900	3875380	Twitter trends are. Okay, well, now I see what's going on there. All right, let me go back. And
3875380	3880260	for some people, that would be sports scores. For some people, that would be stock market. You know,
3880260	3884580	whatever it is that you're into, you flip to another tab, check it. Okay, now back to my game.
3885460	3892420	So, could be interesting. All right, moving on. Let's talk about some other events and Dark
3892420	3899860	Soccer alluded to this earlier. Yes, because, and I am doing it right the fuck now. I actually,
3899860	3905860	I put some of it on the stream. There is a new, well, it's already out the new update
3905860	3911220	for Animal Crossing New Horizons. And it has brought in a few things that I was super excited
3911220	3919380	about. So, you get Luna's bed, which you can then dream and Luna comes out. She was introduced in
3919380	3925460	New Leaf. We could visit the dream villages and people had very interesting dream villages. And
3925460	3931300	I will put it out there for anyone curious. I could village is back. And it is creepy. It
3931300	3938900	looks like it's still a bit in work in progress. But fuck it's creepy. Okay, so anyway, you also
3939780	3944820	have cloud backups. And that's very important to us the first thing, one of the first things I set
3944820	3952980	up. So basically, the cloud backups are going to be if your system is lost or stolen, and you have
3952980	3958020	to replace your system, you can restore your Animal Crossing village as of the last time
3958020	3966500	that it it backed up. And the game will of course do a backup when you aren't playing it. So really
3966500	3972100	useful tool. I know I tell everyone back up everything back up your computer backup everything
3972100	3978740	and your village with all the time and effort we put into it should really be no different. And
3978740	3985700	then the thing I'm doing right now fireworks and you can do custom fireworks although I'm checking
3985700	3990180	mine out and I don't I just put some of my patterns up there. But I'm not seeing any
3990180	3996820	Bob bombs or money bags or trogdor or anything like that. Huh? So I have I guess maybe they're
3996820	4002180	not going in now or maybe I have to set it off myself. You you know, you know, there are thousands
4002180	4008500	of islands in the world right this moment. Having a dick celebration with their fireworks. You know
4008740	4018740	and hold on for for our live listeners. I have it held up to the camera. It's a little blurry,
4018740	4023140	but you can see. Yeah, I see some fireworks going off in the background there. So it's
4023700	4027940	otherwise kind of looks pretty calm. Oh, no, there we go. Okay, so some larger fireworks are kind of
4027940	4032340	going off. They look pretty standard. It looks pretty it's a different look for the game. It's
4032340	4036820	something different. It's one thing I've really enjoyed and Dan and I were having this talk the
4036820	4045380	other day was how well lit and and how good the sound is in the game. Like it really makes use of
4045380	4049620	a pseudo surround when you're playing a handheld or when you're playing it on your TV. It'll use
4049620	4054980	your surround system. So like you'll hear sounds come in and out very subtle noises as you play
4054980	4058660	but lighting effects. The first thing that struck me for the lighting effects was during a
4058660	4065140	thunderstorm and having grown up in thunderstorm central. That is what the sky looks like is very
4065140	4069780	accurate. And I was like, Oh, my God, it kind of hit like a little homesickness in me. Oh,
4069780	4075460	interesting. But you know, right now you have crazy reds raffle. And he wants to get all the
4075460	4081300	money out of you. Five hundred bucks a ticket or bells, I should say. And there are 12 items in it.
4081300	4086980	You get a red sparkler, a blue sparkler, a fountain firework, a bubble blower, and Uchiwa fan, which
4086980	4095700	is something like this. Which is, yeah, like a Japanese it looks like it. I can't think of a
4095700	4098900	better way to describe it. I'm sorry. It kind of looks like a ping pong paddle, but it's a fan.
4098900	4104020	Yeah, it's fan. I think this one says Matsuri. So there you go.
4107620	4111860	I was trying to think of the word. I couldn't think of ping pong paddle, but my brain was going
4111860	4115620	in the same place. That's right. I also get a pinwheel, a tweeter, which I guess is like a
4116260	4121460	maybe a noise maker thing. Blue balloons, red balloons, yellow balloons, green balloons,
4121460	4127780	and pink balloons. And one of the other things, and people are ridiculously excited about this,
4127780	4132020	you can trip again. Yeah, I saw this. Yeah, yeah.
4133700	4144740	So going back, though, to the data mine. A user named Ninji, who does a lot of data mining,
4144740	4150340	found a few things from this update. And some of them aren't really like the biggest of surprises,
4150340	4159620	because these were referred to before. There is a new gyroid. It's 35 underscore gyroid.
4159620	4164500	And the one that I think it is, is the gyroid that appears with Luna. So I don't think that
4164500	4169540	one's anything different. But it does. It does indicate gyroids might like kind of
4169540	4175060	make a, because you don't see them a lot in the game. Yeah, they're there when you're building
4175060	4178980	a bridge or something. But I feel like they were like, it was such a huge part of the first game
4178980	4182740	was collecting them. So it's interesting. That's not there. Kind of just the point that they don't
4182740	4188180	have them right now. I bet they show up in a later update. I do. I just don't see that.
4188180	4192740	I'm sure that they are. Yeah. You know, and of course, you know, if you know actually what
4192740	4199460	they're based off of the Haniwa, they were buried with people. So you're digging up leftover
4200420	4207140	burials. I think that's hilarious. There are new item kinds. And it's all starts off with
4207140	4212660	VGT, I guess like for vegetable and then has name after it. So we have tomato, wheat, sugar cane,
4212660	4220340	potato, carrot, squash, and then map looks like different items in the map. And then any bush for
4220340	4227780	a plumeria. The thing that I would have loved to have seen that has been data mined before
4227780	4236020	and inferred in a game would be Brewster or Master as he is in Japan. They taught,
4236020	4243860	there was a rumor about the roost opening in the museum like it used to be. Although I would love
4243860	4250500	to have the full roost cafe. I think that would be lovely. I'd love to have the cafe. Making
4250500	4256260	drinks for your villagers and whatnot. I think that would be fun, but c'est la vie. We'll find
4256260	4261860	out eventually, but it just makes me happy to see so much support and seeing new stuff come out
4261860	4267700	every time. I'm delighted. Yeah. I like that they are, you know, cause I've kind of complained on
4267700	4271700	this show before. Like, all right, things are starting to feel a little stale for me. And it's
4271700	4275860	like, right when I start to get in that mindset, it's like, Oh, here comes an update. So I mean,
4275860	4280580	they are doing really good timing on that. I gotta say it's, it's working. Don't forget about your
4280580	4289380	seasonal items, Rob. There are two kimono. Of course, based on, I think based on legend stories
4289380	4298660	and then I think a Brazilian rodeo horse. So some pretty neat stuff. Yeah, definitely.
4299780	4305620	Look at your seasonal items. The Tanabata thing of course is over. So we have new things. You
4305620	4309620	just keep checking up on them. There are some really neat stuff. Now, if you meet things,
4309620	4315140	if you guys would mind, please share your dream codes with me, um, over, uh, in the
4315140	4320740	vog network discord, I think it'd be a great place to do that. So vog network.com slash discord. I
4320740	4324820	don't remember if we have an animal crossing channel. I thought, I think we did, but something
4324820	4328900	happened, but you can put them in the orange sounds radio channel. That's fine. Um, so please,
4330900	4336500	I'll go ahead and pass out my dream code. Oh, please. Yes. Yes. Zero two three seven
4337140	4343140	eight seven three seven four eight one six. I'll post it in our chat, but for listeners,
4343140	4349460	come check out. That's great. Thank you. I don't have one yet. Um, I haven't put it, uh,
4349460	4354660	I haven't put it in, uh, or I haven't put mine on the web yet. I heard there are some problems
4354660	4360900	if you advertise your social media on your passport with those dream islands, which to me is
4360900	4367700	ridiculous. It's just, it's overreaching by Nintendo, but whatever. I mean, I guess they're
4367700	4374500	worried I might have porn on my Twitter or something. Um, so whatever. But, um, so for
4374500	4379620	that reason, I don't have mine posted on dream yet, but I will probably edit my card. Most people
4379620	4383540	that come to visit me know my fricking social media at this point. So it doesn't really do
4383540	4388820	me any favors anyway. Um, Facebook group, we have a thread already for dream codes.
4389380	4395780	Of course the group is private. So if any listener is friends with me on Facebook or anyone who's in
4395780	4402340	that group, um, add, just say that you came, you know, like leave a note that you came from
4402340	4405860	listening to the podcast and I'll be sure to add you in, but you break my fricking rules and I
4405860	4417140	break your back. Oh my gosh. All right. I've already kicked out some, uh, two people for,
4417140	4422580	um, for breaking rules. Uh, well, the thing is that people were like doing,
4423220	4429940	one of the rules that I have on there is that you do not, uh, do, uh, sell, um, items for,
4429940	4435060	uh, Nook Miles or you don't sell Nook Miles for money, right? Because that's a good way to get
4435060	4442420	my channel banned. So I, and I, I, um, I will ban people for selling bootleg items. It hasn't
4442420	4447060	stopped me from buying, you know, a few amiibo cards for characters I wanted. Just keep it off
4447060	4454180	of, off of the group because that will get my places. Um, and, uh, I will say, so please post
4454180	4461300	some dream codes to the OLR channel in discord because I want to do a stream later this week
4461300	4467060	where I visit some islands and Jamie's will be one of the first that I will go visit. Uh,
4467060	4472100	the more codes we get, the more islands I will go visiting. Uh, my island is kind of hot garbage.
4472100	4476100	It's really taken over by roses right now cause I'm not very good at pruning them. So they have
4476100	4481460	just, yeah, they're, they're practically weeds. They're very colorful weeds. You know what though?
4481460	4487220	I'm okay with a rainbow explosion a little bit on my island. Uh, but yeah, I don't like running
4487220	4491780	around and accidentally picking up like all these flowers that fill my thing and I have to go sell
4491780	4497540	them. I get it. I get it. Just irritating. So once I clean my island, I will post a dream code as
4497540	4502580	well because I do, I do have some cute things I've done. I have my little Zen garden. It's cute.
4502580	4507140	So, all right. Right. I've had a better view by, by the way, the fireworks and actually one of my
4507140	4513060	custom ones did show up. So I'll just put it up there while, while we're moving on. All right,
4513060	4518340	well let's move on to the next story. So Loki, what do you have for us? Yes. So let's talk a
4518340	4526500	little bit about Minecraft again. So you can now play doom inside of Minecraft as well as
4526500	4535140	I've seen Minecraft played inside of Minecraft as well. Um, some other sort of, so it's this mod
4535140	4540660	called a VM computers mod allows you to build your own computer in game. And then I think run like
4540660	4547380	a virtual, um, PC. So you can do all sorts of things in there. Um, so of course people have
4547380	4553940	played Minecraft in Minecraft and, um, windows 95 and Minecraft and stuff like that. So a pretty
4553940	4563540	cool, um, thing that I don't know. It's a little unnecessary, but whatever. Uh, the one I actually
4563540	4568340	saw that was kind of funny. There was, um, a mod that someone did that actually this cause this
4568340	4573140	is actually kind of like doing an actual screen, but I saw one that actually they took a camera
4573140	4577700	feed and like projecting it onto actual blocks. So the blocks are changing to make the screen. So
4577700	4582580	it was very low res and someone actually played and beat Minecraft on that as well. But this is,
4582580	4588180	this is a little bit more practical as you can actually see and probably be able to utilize,
4588180	4593060	um, this versus the other way, but it's, it's a neat mod. I'm guessing if you have the Java
4593060	4597700	version of Minecraft, you can go check it out, but, uh, not for me necessarily. Cause I've been
4597700	4602340	playing mostly on bedrock, but it's still pretty cool. Um, Minecraft is such a huge game and it
4602340	4606180	has a really, um, you know, like a younger following that like your kids are into Minecraft,
4606180	4610180	right? Do you think something like this, I mean, I think a lot of us kind of like roll our eyes
4610180	4613940	at it. We go, you know, what are they going to put doom on next to toaster? But do you think
4613940	4618020	something like this actually kind of like helps a younger audience discover some of these retro
4618020	4623220	games through this? I don't think so because you would have already had to have them on your PC in
4623220	4628580	the first place. It's not like it's just giving you, like, it's not like, you know, finding a
4628580	4633540	retro game and say the, you know, early version of animal crossing or something like that.
4633540	4639860	This is more of like, Hey, it's a neat thing. I can play now doom on, on, on Minecraft.
4639860	4645860	I could also play doom outside of Minecraft. Um, it's more of like kind of a, just a neat thing.
4645860	4652260	Like, Oh, Hey look, I was able to get this to work. Um, is it practical? Probably not.
4652260	4655860	I don't know if this would maybe necessarily work in like, say a server or something where
4655860	4661700	you could run this and maybe have your friends play stuff. Um, I don't know. It's just, it's,
4661700	4667700	I think it's more of a silly thing to do. Now, DJ Rama S points out in chat,
4667700	4673540	you can run Linux on a toaster and you can play doom on Linux, but can you run the popular
4673540	4681140	screensaver application from the 1990s after dark on Linux, because then you could get toasters on
4681140	4690500	your toaster. Yes, you could. For the record, you can run after dark. Um, I think that you can run
4690500	4698580	it on any Mac up to Mojave. Um, after dark was the shit, like whatever happened to after dark,
4698580	4703540	like, I guess like you can still do it, but the thing is, is that, um, for, uh, Catalina,
4703540	4713940	it's only 32 bit applications. So, huh. Ah, all right. Well, let's move on. We have some more news
4713940	4719540	and I want to get to talking a little more about halo. Uh, we talked a little earlier in the show
4719540	4724500	about halo, but, uh, and, and Loki had talked about the battle royale mode, um, which I am
4724500	4729060	really jazzed about. And I hope that is something that happens. And I don't usually get into battle
4729060	4734020	royale, but I'm like battle royale and halo would be really fun because it's arcade and fast paced,
4734020	4740100	which I know Fortnite is very that way as well. But look, I come from a generation that I played
4740100	4745380	a lot more halo back in the day, especially the classics one and two. So like a battle royale
4745380	4748500	and that would be awesome. You know, it'd be really awesome. It would be a battle royale and
4748500	4752180	quake. And I'm sure somebody has already made that mod, but are there a hundred people playing it?
4752180	4757700	I don't know. Anyway, let's talk a little bit about, um, some of the graphics criticism that
4757700	4761940	came up, which again, I have to be honest, you know, and I talked about this on last week's show
4761940	4767140	and somebody even made a clip of it, which is really funny, but, um, like I, I didn't get the
4767140	4771620	criticism to the extent that it's out there. Like people are making it sound like it's a crime and
4771620	4775780	I'm like, it didn't look that bad. You guys calm down, but you know, yeah. Okay. There was some
4775780	4782020	pop-in and things like that, but obviously 343 industries, they've heard a little bit of that
4782020	4788340	feedback as well. So they made a blog post where community manager, John Juniezic, I hope I said
4788340	4794020	that right. Sorry. Uh, said that they have quote, heard the feedback, uh, and that the, the build
4794020	4799460	used to run the campaign demo was work in progress from several weeks ago with a variety of graphical
4799460	4804820	elements and game systems still being finished and polished. So, you know, kind of the typical,
4804820	4809780	like it's not done yet, so y'all need to hold on. Um, and then, uh, they also kind of talked about
4809780	4814820	how they're going for a classic style. They're getting away from Halo 4 and Halo 5 and Halo
4814820	4819380	Wars 2, and they want to go close to the original trilogy, which I think is a good move. And to me,
4819380	4824900	the demo really showed that. Um, so there was that. Um, and then they also talked a little
4824900	4829620	bit about the pop-in, uh, and this has to do a little bit with the dynamic lighting they're
4829620	4834260	saying, which is a little bit more technically ambitious than static lighting. Uh, and because
4834260	4839060	the campaign demo took place in like a valley where the sun wasn't really reaching it, and so
4839060	4845380	there isn't as much light, it looked a little drab. So that's kind of interesting. Uh, 343 actually
4845380	4849940	said they watched one of the criticism videos about this and said they agree with the assessments
4849940	4855860	and saying, we do have work to do to address some of these areas and raise the level of fidelity
4855860	4860740	and overall presentation for the final game. We don't have firm answers or outcomes to share yet,
4860740	4864900	but the team is working as quickly as possible on plans to address some of the feedback around
4864900	4871700	detail, clarity, and overall fidelity. Um, again, I'm still excited to play the game. I,
4871700	4876340	I'm not scared off by some of the stuff they've been talking about. Um, I'm kind of jazzed that
4876340	4880340	they're going for a more classic feel. The fact that they're injecting a modern battle
4880340	4886020	royale into it. I haven't been this excited for a Halo game since probably number four.
4886020	4892020	Um, it's, it's been a while, so, um, I'm excited. So we'll check it out. Um,
4893300	4897220	let me ask a quick question though of chat and my co-hosts, because obviously we live in the
4897220	4903380	day and age of instant, instant feedback. Thanks to Twitter. We, we love instant feedback. Thanks
4903380	4907300	to our chat room. That's part of, that's been the backbone of the show for the years that we've
4907300	4912340	been doing it, but you know, an independent podcast and a large video game developer,
4912340	4918740	two very, very, very different types of audiences. Um, in this day and age of that online criticism,
4918740	4926580	is this helping games development? Did this feedback help Halo Infinite or is this holding
4926580	4932820	it back? What do you guys think? Any feedback is good. I think as long as it's constructive.
4933700	4937700	Right. Constructive is a very important term because certainly we've seen the bullshit,
4937700	4943940	like death threats, harassment, uh, racist, sexist, you name it type of language.
4943940	4950660	And we can all agree that's all bullshit and does nothing, but constructive feedback. Um,
4951700	4956260	yeah, I think constructive feedback that you're hearing a lot of it in this, that that's kind of
4956260	4959540	the message they're receiving from it. What do you think? What do you think, Logie?
4962180	4966900	Um, I don't know. I mean, I think any feedback's good. So at least they know if they're on the
4966900	4972500	right track or not. Um, I'm just curious to see what they do with it. I mean, obviously
4973140	4980100	gameplay has been pretty much a focus of them, so I'm excited. I didn't play a lot of, uh,
4980100	4985140	Halo. I mean, I've kind of gotten to it like Halo three, but I never really played much aside from
4985140	4990820	like going to a friend's house and playing some multiplayer of, uh, one or two. But yeah, I mean,
4991620	4997860	I don't think it's going to be a bad thing. Yeah. Well, we'll see. I'm also kind of like,
4997860	5001620	Oh, they don't have a lot of time to really fix things. I mean, if this game's coming up for the
5001620	5006260	holidays and they probably already are on an aggressive track to try to get this game finished.
5006260	5011780	So I wonder how much of this we're going to see in like, uh, day one patches. I know that'll be
5011780	5015460	a big one. There's probably gonna be a big day one patch. It's going to address some of this as
5016420	5021540	well. Um, VG realness. Oh, interesting. I love this comment. VG realness says,
5021540	5027220	I think the best example of instant feedback, despite its methods and delivery,
5027220	5032100	important disclaimer there was the Sonic movie and SSG100 Matt echoes that saying,
5032100	5037060	I was thinking that. Yeah. And that was very recent memory when that first Sonic trailer
5037060	5042260	came out and most of us responded to that and that original design by saying yikes,
5042900	5048980	but they, they heard that loud and clear, went back, reinvented it and the finished product.
5048980	5052420	I think at the end of the day, it seemed like a lot. I still haven't seen the movie. I really
5052420	5059300	need to, especially since I sit at home all day. Uh, I, I think there that it came out a much
5059300	5065460	better product as a result and probably made a ton more money than it would have, whether it was
5065460	5070020	that that whole controversy created more public awareness or whatever it was. I it's kind of
5070020	5078340	interesting to me. So that's very true. Very true. All right. Um, let's move on. We got a
5078340	5081540	lot more stories to get to and we're running a little long tonight. So I might, I might
5081540	5087460	accelerate on some of these stories, but, uh, dark Sakura. Well, um, something very
5087460	5092420	stupid is going to happen. And you know, when I say something as stupid, it's going to be pretty
5092420	5098740	stupid. Um, there is going to be the legal legends championship and it's happening in Shanghai.
5099380	5105140	Um, even though we're in the middle of a global pandemic, um, riot games announced that it's
5105140	5110660	going to take place on September 20th between September 25th at October 21st with the finals
5110660	5116500	at the Pudong soccer stadium or football stadium. Um, they are promising safety measures, but
5118020	5123300	no, no, no, but Jamie hasn't China beat COVID.
5123940	5130660	No, they, they had to, as far as I understand, they had a massive resurgence again.
5131220	5139060	So no, now they said that they're going to be, um, you know, having like abilities for virtual
5139060	5145460	fans, but it's, it doesn't, first of all, there's the risks in travel. There's the risks in staying
5145460	5150100	at hotels. There's risks in restaurants. There's a risk of being around that many people and
5150660	5155860	fuck them. You know, and somebody posted a story in discord. That's kind of tangential
5155860	5160260	to this whole thing. It was about a call of duty competition and, and sorry, I don't have discord
5160260	5164420	up in front of me right now. Yeah. But like, there's like, one of them was supposed to be
5164420	5170260	a virtual event, but they like went rogue and did it anyway in person. And Oh my God, like,
5170260	5174260	you know, and I think everybody that was in discord kind of had the same reaction I did
5174260	5178900	where it was like, what the fuck are they thinking? Like I, it, they weren't, it blows
5179700	5186180	my mind that people don't take this seriously. Like I, I, I very much like when it comes to
5186180	5191300	politics, when it comes to should pineapple be on pizza or not, I try very hard to put myself
5191300	5195620	in somebody else's shoes and see things from their perspective. This is one of those things.
5195620	5202980	I can't do it. Like, I don't understand why people are so insistent on this whole thing being made
5202980	5207460	up or fake, especially when like, you know, and I, y'all know I went off a couple of weeks ago
5207460	5211940	because I knew somebody that was affected by this, but now we're, we're hearing celebrities,
5212580	5219940	politicians. Hello. We thought that my mom had it, you know, and you know how frightened I was.
5219940	5225380	Yeah. You know, my, my little brother had it and may actually still have it. And then of course,
5225380	5232260	there's all the long-term, uh, detriments now, um, permanent lung damage, um, uh, bringing on
5232260	5240580	other symptoms, uh, people developing fibromyalgia, for example. I mean, it's, it's bad. It's really
5240580	5244980	bad. And you know, people like, Oh, it's a political, no, it's not a political thing.
5244980	5250820	It's a human thing. Okay. We just, and I was even telling one of my, one of my friends from
5250820	5256100	my synagogue, she's like, so if you go out traveling, do you do the, the two weeks social
5256100	5259220	distancing when you get home? And I was like, well, first of all, I don't go out traveling,
5259220	5262900	but if I did damn right, I would be staying at home because I actually give a shit about other
5262900	5267940	people, you know? Well, I think I put it that way. I think what actually what I said is that
5267940	5273540	not distancing is selfish. It means you don't care about other people. It's not a political
5273540	5279140	thing at all. And as I was really dismayed, I went to, um, my sister meeting today, um,
5279140	5282740	cause they were going to do like a big makeup tutorial and I thought, Oh, it's all going to
5282740	5287940	be, you know, upper face and people are going to be wearing, no one was wearing a mask except me.
5288900	5294900	And so I stayed as much of a six foot distance from other people as I could. I kept my mask on.
5296020	5301460	There was no way I was going to expose myself and you know, I ended up just leaving. I mean,
5301460	5308900	and I love my sisters, don't get me wrong, but I'm, I'm just not comfortable around it. And then,
5308900	5316180	you know, I'm not trying to make this about, about me, but I'm also immunocompromised.
5316180	5320660	Yeah. So, and especially since I have that pneumonia, my lungs are already,
5320660	5324180	I'm still on asthma medication. There's a chance it could have been COVID,
5325300	5330340	but I couldn't get a test. And so now for people like me who thought they,
5330340	5335780	who might've had it and couldn't get tested, we're living in this sort of Schrodinger's virus
5335780	5340660	state, you know, and, and then, you know, they're also now saying that even if you had it,
5340660	5347380	the antibodies aren't lasting. I just, I, every day I just hope, and I, I don't, I don't know if
5347380	5353700	I like to say pray, but I just, I wish very badly, um, that there's some good news on this front with
5353700	5357300	the multiple vaccines that are happening because with every day that goes by, I keep thinking
5357300	5362660	other people are going to get me killed. You know what I hope? I hope that, um,
5364260	5367940	I mean, you know, they're already talking about the pharmaceutical companies are really wanting
5367940	5375380	to gouge, uh, prices for, uh, for these things. And I think it's absolutely disgusting. Um,
5376500	5380900	but I am hoping that when we have the vaccines that they're going to be made available to
5380900	5383220	everybody. I really do. Same.
5383220	5390180	Um, and I mean, and I'm going to just say one more thing about it. You know, as a student of history,
5392660	5395860	all you have to do is look to the past. All you have to do is look to the past and see,
5396500	5403860	you know, for example, when the, um, when the Spanish flu was a thing, they had this whole
5403860	5410820	drama where, um, people didn't want to wear their masks and there were people lobby. And just like
5410820	5418980	we see today, and you saw the second surge of, um, of Spanish influenza killed bright people.
5418980	5426260	One of my favorite artists, um, egg on Shayla died of Spanish influenza. Um, his, uh, I don't
5426260	5430500	know if they were married, but his lady was pregnant and he did a painting called the family
5430500	5437620	that was her and him and their, their fetus as a child. And she died right after that painting.
5437620	5443860	And he died right after her and that knowing that that's actually the thing that's been really
5443940	5450820	driving this home for me is to look at such a genius artist and think there are other
5450820	5457300	genius artists now who are dying from this plague. Yeah. So, okay. I didn't mean to go on a tirade,
5457300	5463780	but maybe it isn't directly about video games, but it's on everybody's mind. So, you know,
5463780	5467460	and this is a place for that type of stuff sometimes. So anyway, let's, you know, we'll
5467460	5473380	just keep our fingers and toes crossed that, um, we just, Hey, at least I know I'm taking all the
5473940	5479700	precautions best I can. Um, but I can't control other people. That's all we can do. All right,
5479700	5484580	let's move on. Let's, let's talk about, let's talk about somewhat happier news and talk about
5484580	5488660	an old game. Still going all the, a game that's been going as long as this show.
5489940	5494980	Yeah. What's my remake coming out? I mean, seriously. So final fantasy 11, the game that I
5494980	5501540	like spent so many years playing and, um, they're announcing that they're getting yet another update
5501540	5505380	to it. You might think, geez, you know, are they done with that game yet? No, apparently not.
5506740	5510660	So they're doing a brand new update. That's going to add a whole new storyline to the game as well.
5510660	5514260	Apparently it's going to be more end game content. So you have to play through the last update that
5514260	5520580	they had. And, um, yeah, I mean, it looks like there's some other enhancements being done to the
5520580	5525860	beast master class, but that's pretty exciting. They're still doing updates for that game.
5526820	5532660	When's the port or remake coming out? Yeah. That mobile port discussion really disappeared
5532660	5536100	in the last, what's just feels like it's been like five years since they showed that off.
5538740	5542740	I mean, honestly, it's not going to be siphoning that many. I don't think anyone's going to be
5542740	5547860	leaving final fantasy 14 to play it. Yeah. It would be nice to have it like updated.
5547860	5552500	Or charge one subscription fee for multiple games would probably still rake in, you know,
5552500	5557780	decent amount of money. Why not? It works for game pass. Right. So there is that. So, um,
5559700	5563140	I have you, have you ever been tempted to go back and check it out all these years later, Loki?
5563940	5569380	I remember I played a little bit on a pirate server a while back and that was okay,
5569380	5573300	but it was really empty. It would be better if I had friends playing it because
5573300	5579620	I did like how fast they had really like boosted the percentage of, uh, XP that you would get.
5579620	5585300	So the rates were really fast. So you could solo yourself pretty fast through that game. Um,
5585300	5591460	but it still was like really barren and there was like no one there and going back to it after so
5591460	5597460	long, not playing it. Um, I didn't remember what to do for most of them. Like, I don't remember
5597460	5606260	where I had to level up here. So it was a little difficult there, but, um, I do like the fast
5606260	5610260	progression through that and it would be nice to be able to play some of the other expansions that
5610260	5615620	way. Cause, um, it was a real bear to have to like, you know, search for parties and stuff
5615620	5622260	too. And the level caps thing was also annoying. Um, it was terrible being a white mage. Yeah.
5622260	5629620	So like, um, I would like to go back and try it again, but like, I don't know. I'd have a hard
5629620	5639300	time justifying pain 12 bucks a month. Yeah. All right. Uh, let's move on, um, and talk about
5639300	5643860	something, uh, a little newer, uh, but coming to a new console, this was pretty quick, but, um,
5643860	5650100	this week cuphead released on the PlayStation four. Um, and this, this game of course was already
5650100	5656900	out on, uh, uh, Microsoft, uh, areas like, uh, windows 10 and, um, Xbox. Uh, and then, uh, it
5656900	5663860	was out on switch a few months ago. Um, but now it's out on PlayStation four, um, and they came
5663860	5667060	out this week. There were some, there were some leaks and things leading up to it, like, uh,
5667060	5670900	another store in another country had to add some artwork up. So people kind of knew it was coming,
5670900	5675700	but, uh, it was confirmed in an official PlayStation blog post that hello, it's here today.
5675700	5679700	And obviously if you haven't played the game yet, it's a, it's got amazing art direction in the
5679700	5685380	game. It's, it's really a stunner, um, in that regard. Um, but it is kind of also interesting
5685380	5690500	because, you know, studio MDHR, uh, kind of had a partnership with Microsoft going on.
5690500	5695700	So is it kind of weird to see this on it, but it isn't, I don't know if the Microsoft logo shows
5695700	5699220	up on the boot of the game or something like that, or if there was some type of like other
5699220	5703620	agreement there, but it's just, it's interesting to me that these Microsoft things, like it made
5703620	5707620	once it made some sense on Nintendo, but it's really weird when you see it on PlayStation,
5707620	5712660	like Minecraft. Right. But of course, as you guys know, that predates the Microsoft, um,
5712660	5718660	acquisition there, uh, why Minecraft is on PlayStation and Nintendo systems.
5718660	5725300	It's kind of interesting, you know, um, they also made a brand new animated short,
5725300	5730180	uh, which is like a stop motion. Uh, and you can check that out on the official PlayStation blog,
5730180	5734420	but yeah, if you haven't played Cuphead yet, uh, definitely take a moment to, uh, check it out.
5734420	5738580	It's a great game. All right. Aren't they doing like a cartoon series as well? I swear,
5739060	5745700	I saw something like that too. Yeah. Like again, this vape, this huge, massive video game, uh,
5745700	5751220	on streaming services, uh, barrage of stuff. Yeah. I feel like Cuphead, something we've seen in that
5751220	5755860	too. I get sounds like something that would be a Netflix thing as well. Yeah. Did you remember
5755860	5761620	S and chatter both saying cup had the cuphead show on Netflix. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Was it on now
5761620	5766740	or is it coming out, uh, in development? Yeah. It's probably one of those things that's going
5766740	5770020	to be held up a little bit by what's going on in the world. Although animation can probably
5770020	5775380	done a little, a little easier, uh, at home than, uh, the live shot stuff. But anyway.
5775380	5781380	Oh, absolutely. Well, let's take a trip down memory lane. Uh, and let's go to a time when,
5781380	5785540	uh, we didn't have Netflix to get series for shows. You had the super Mario brothers super
5785540	5790020	show, and that was it. It's the classic game of the week. And every week here on the program,
5790020	5795380	dark soccer steps into the gaming vault to find a game that she thinks, Hey, you brat should be
5795380	5799860	checking this out. Um, but once a month dark soccer likes to mix it up and you know what
5799860	5805060	pinball are video games too. Kinda. They're just very different. Uh, so, uh, it's time
5805060	5810900	for the classic pinball of the month. Dark soccer. What did you pick for the, um, classic
5810900	5821380	pinball of the month? That your hint? Yes. I think it's a good one. Let me put up some of the
5821380	5828020	footage too. Um, Indiana Jones, the pinball adventure, not to be confused with the 2008,
5828020	5833940	uh, Indiana Jones game that Stern did. So, and also on top, sorry, I quickly want to point out,
5833940	5839060	I'm using a video cause this doesn't exist in the, um, FX games and all that. So, um,
5839060	5842900	this pinball table may be a little click clacky in the background. If the noise is too much,
5842900	5846020	let me know and I'll turn it off. You guys can see the table well enough right now.
5846980	5851940	Okay. Well, I don't hear anything. Yeah. You and Loki won't, but the listeners will.
5852980	5859140	At any rate. Um, this one was one of, uh, it was by, uh, Midway Williams. Um, and it was one of
5859140	5865700	their super pin series, which is a wide body table. Um, and it was the first pinball game to
5865700	5872340	ever use the Williams DS, uh, sorry, DCS sound system. Um, and it had, um, I mean,
5872500	5878660	some of the amazing stuff with a lot of effort went into this one. Um, the game itself came out
5878660	5886260	in 1993. Um, and it was, uh, uh, designed by Mark Ritchie, who is the younger brother of Steve
5886260	5893780	Ritchie. And we all know, I love Steve. Steve's a cool guy. Um, but, uh, and apparently he's still
5893780	5899700	doing voices for the pinballs. Cause I hear his voice all the time now on AC DC, um, of the other
5899700	5905060	super pin series. Um, for example, one was Twilight zone, which is another one I have in
5905060	5910180	star Trek, the next generation, which is another one I have. Um, we, and yes, we do have Indiana
5910180	5917860	Jones right now. And it was also, um, uh, a game that included clips from the first three of the
5917860	5924740	films with, uh, John Rice Davies, um, re re uh, pricing his role as Salah for new, uh, for new
5924740	5930580	speech in the game. Um, so it's got a different, uh, a few different features. There's actually
5930580	5938020	a long shaped mini play field for a roll down game. Um, you have to steer the ball by tilting
5938020	5944020	the mini play field left and right. It's called path of adventure. Um, other modes in the game.
5944020	5953940	Um, let me get those pulled up real quick. Um, we have, uh, gosh, I lost the mode list. Oh, well,
5953940	5958260	that's fine. Cause you know, you still gotta play the game for yourself. Now this particular game
5958260	5962980	also has, Oh yeah, there it is. We have get the idol where you have to, uh, get the idol by
5962980	5966740	shooting a lock sink hole. You have the Raven bar, get the medallions. So these are all for the
5966740	5972100	Raiders. The lost dark ones. You have the streets of Cairo, the well of souls, which is a six ball
5972100	5978260	multi-ball, um, with a lock hole. That's worth 2 million points multiplied by the number of balls
5978260	5983700	and play balls. Um, you have Indiana Jones and the temple of doom. So you get monkey brains,
5984340	5989700	uh, steal the stones escape in the minecart, which is a video mode. Um, video modes kind
5989700	5994740	of irritate me, but this one's pretty fun. Um, you have also survived the rope bridge,
5994740	6000580	um, which, which, uh, it's a successive ramp shot one. Um, and you score 10 million each. Um,
6000580	6006580	and then Indiana Jones and the last crusade, um, you have the castle, but they misspelled it as
6006660	6013940	Grunewald. So, um, Yay for that. Um, it was a drop target. You have take chase. Um,
6013940	6018740	you have three challenges and then the choose wisely, which is another video mode where
6018740	6023060	basically you're choosing your grail. I mean, sorry, it's not a spoiler to say that you got
6023060	6029860	to get the Holy grail at the end of the damn movie. Um, and then, um, you'll get, uh, you'll
6029860	6035220	get like different animations. So if you, if you choose the right grail, you get the night saying
6035300	6039620	you have chosen wisely and get 20 million points. If you choose the wrong rail, you'll see the
6039620	6045380	animation of the Nazi dying in the night. We'll say you have chosen poorly with the face melting
6045380	6052100	and all that. The face melting was in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Cool. This is last crusade.
6052100	6058740	Oh, so it's the Nazi dying. Um, and you get five million points. Um, for your multi balls,
6058740	6063140	of course there's the regular multi ball, um, which, which is, uh, for three drop targets that
6063140	6066500	cover a hole and then you shoot, lock the hole, you know, et cetera. You have quick multi ball,
6066500	6072420	which is a two ball multi, um, with different modes. You have the fish of tails, you have the
6072420	6079220	cross of Coronado, the remains of your hockey, the diamond of Shanghai and the idol of the Incas.
6079220	6083140	You have the well of souls, which is the six ball multi ball, and then the eternal life,
6083140	6090260	which is another six ball by completing all 12, uh, uh, modes that like start modes is
6090260	6096980	basically your, uh, your wizard mode. Um, and on top of that, so there is another
6096980	6103220	fun thing about this game. Rob, do you know what that is? No, because I actually haven't played
6103220	6113380	this table ever. Um, I'll give you a hint. Uh, Trader Sam's, uh, alcoholic beverages.
6114340	6120660	No, I tried. This is a table that had the distinction of being at Disneyland
6122820	6132020	in a custom, uh, a custom, uh, cabinet. Um, and there are plenty of people who have, uh,
6132580	6138500	recreated the Disneyland, uh, cabinet, uh, with its custom side art. And I mean,
6138500	6142500	you remember this one, right? It was in trader Sam's. If you went all the way over to the left
6142500	6147540	side of the building and it was tucked away, it had the custom artwork and everything. It
6147540	6152820	was really cool. Um, I was blown away. We even got into trader Sam's that one time we went,
6152820	6157300	we had to wait outside for like an hour. Um, so I don't remember seeing the whole machine.
6157300	6162900	I was just excited to have a fruity alcoholic beverages. No, no, no trader Sam's across from
6162900	6168820	the Indiana Jones ride. No alcoholic beverages there. Why am I thinking of the place at the
6168820	6174660	Disneyland hotel? I don't know why that's where my brain went. My bad. Do you know what I'm talking
6174660	6183620	about? That bar too many Disney places. Sorry. Okay. Okay. I do vaguely remember that now.
6183620	6190180	Okay. You're right. They did have a pinball table there. Yeah. It's it's really, um, you know,
6190180	6194340	and I thought it was great that they even went so far to have one with the custom cabinet and
6194340	6202740	everything. Um, I'm trying to see if I can find it. Um, uh, Jones pinball. Cause yeah,
6202740	6209060	they did some crazy stuff to it and yeah, there's a, uh, video of people playing it. Okay. So I've
6209060	6213300	got the picture now. Sorry, uh, people at home, you're just going to have to Google it yourself,
6213300	6221700	but I'm posting something in chat and Rob, when you see it, it'll instantly look familiar. Um,
6221700	6226660	but yeah, they ended up taking it out when they restructured, um, more of trader Sam's to expand
6226660	6233220	it for other items. So, um, and then you can also find other people's, uh, custom. Yeah. I,
6233220	6240420	I remember that store. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, but it's honestly enough. Um, just,
6241780	6247780	again, it was a super nice touch. Um, and of course, lots of people being fans of it have
6247780	6254980	since, um, recreated it. And so, uh, a lot of times you'll find this modifications that people
6254980	6262180	have in their own homes. By the way, dark soccer, I have good news. I'm not crazy. The place I was
6262180	6269540	thinking of was also called trader Sam's enchanted Tiki bar. Ah, Sam talking, or maybe it's just
6269540	6274340	called the trading post. Yeah, maybe, maybe you're crazy. No, it's fine. It's like, there's a lot of
6274340	6280580	places because they, you know, on the jungle cruise and actually, yeah, it's across from
6280580	6285380	the jungle cruise and Indiana Jones. Right. It's just a little bit further past. Yeah. But, um,
6285380	6290660	but yeah, I mean, I was even telling Dan, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be full of hate if we did
6290660	6296020	our table like that. Cause it's really freaking cool. Um, and on top of that, the wood thing,
6296020	6300740	one of the things I liked about having that wood rim on it, I have a bad habit of getting little
6300740	6307940	like lines on my wrist from hitting the metal guard, uh, on the top of the table. Um, and
6309220	6313460	this, you know, I have like a little tilt sometimes that I'll do where I actually shake
6313460	6318340	the top of the table. And so, uh, this was easier to do, not like a tilt, but, you know,
6318340	6325220	just like nudging the machine. You don't want to tilt and Siri answered me for some reason.
6325460	6331140	But yeah, so anyway, that's, that's your game. Um, it is, uh, Indiana Jones,
6331140	6337940	the pinball adventure. Oh, and one other thing about it. Your, uh, your, uh, trigger is actually
6337940	6345540	a gun. That's not the only people game to do that though. If I'm not mistaken, I think, uh,
6345540	6351380	judge dread does it. And I think that star Trek is a phaser, but Dan had it for the longest time.
6351380	6354820	And like, this is going to make sense to nobody, but people who have been in my house.
6354900	6360740	Um, where, cause we have, uh, pinballs in the dining room and he had it on the most
6360740	6367220	outmost edge. So I would walk by it, go into the kitchen. And if I was a little bit sleepy,
6367220	6375300	I would hit my thigh on that damn gun. And I'm just going to tell y'all that hurts. That hurts.
6375300	6380820	It hurts. Not good. Um, quick question from SSG100 Matt. And as we kind of come back,
6380820	6384500	I'll, I'll turn off the pinball table. Oops. I need the shot that has my co-host on it. There
6384500	6389060	we go. Um, as we come back to the show here, um, as you want her to Matt asked this question,
6389060	6396260	a serious question, what is an effective pro tip way to nudge a table? Um, so actually there are
6396260	6399700	a bunch of channels out there that teach you the secret skills, like how to nudge. There's
6400340	6405780	an article about it on pin side, um, which, uh, I would be, uh, more than happy to link. Cause
6405780	6411140	there's some video in there. I'll put that in chat right now. Um, but I've seen people do it
6411140	6415620	different ways. You know, some people just use their upper body strength and shake the table.
6416260	6423860	Um, now me, I use my knees. I also don't really get a lot of motion out of it. I'm not really
6423860	6429780	someone to play for nudging, but, um, I would always do it on a couple of tables that drifted.
6430340	6434660	So it would just be to knock the ball back into play when it was about to drain or went down the
6434660	6441060	wrong area. Um, I would sometimes use it on, um, Twilight zone for the MA and a black Knight for
6441060	6446260	the Magna save. Cause you catch it in the Magna save. And if you start the tilt right when not
6446260	6450820	the tilt, but the nudge right when, um, you're releasing from the Magna save, you can get it
6450820	6457220	further back into play. Um, I, I I'm one that I use my knees. I dodged the side of it with my,
6457220	6463940	you know, with my Chinle power thighs. Um, yeah. Yeah. Uh, some, some guys will just,
6463940	6470020	we'll do a full on shake. Dan's a shaker. Wow. Um, another one that I like to do, I was talking
6470020	6476340	about, so, um, I will, depending on what flipper side that I need, I'll use the opposite hand,
6476340	6483460	put it on top of the table and give it a shove. So yeah. Um, that's actually 100 masses. There's
6483460	6488820	people who quickly slap, slap the side of tables. I'm a slapper. I'm definitely a slapper for me.
6489940	6495300	I listen here, you dumb machine, but you know, I have problems with my wrist,
6496260	6505140	so I'll hurt myself doing that. So I actually just use my inner knee. I will shake it by knocking
6505140	6512420	the legs or the corner edge with my knees. So I do the, the Chinle power thighs. All right.
6513060	6517460	Well, there you go. Your classic pinball table of the month, Indiana Jones as seen it doesn't
6517460	6523940	have a little bit. All right, let's move on. Let's get to some rapid fire news. We're going to
6523940	6527780	quickly go through some other news here. And by the way, as I don't think I mentioned it towards
6527780	6531460	the top of the show, I think you did say it dark soccer, but just to make sure everybody knows
6531460	6536500	dark Sakura, thanks to some changes, um, in her day job and schedule and stuff will no longer be
6536500	6541060	departing the show at the halfway point regularly. I mean, there are unexpected things will come up,
6541060	6546740	but, uh, we're going to have her all night. Yay. All right. Um, for the foreseeable future,
6546740	6550580	at least for the next six months, unless my schedule changes again. So I'm super,
6550580	6554340	super happy about it. That's always good news. All right. That's the closing shift.
6554980	6562820	Let's get into some rapid fire news. Loki. So, um, there's more stuff coming to Netflix,
6562820	6568420	more view game adaptations. So the first one that was announced was beyond good and evil is going
6568420	6575620	to be getting a movie, um, coming to Netflix. And that's currently in development right now. Um,
6575620	6580820	by, I guess, I don't know who necessarily working on it right now. Uh, let's see here. Oh, I'm
6580820	6586580	sorry. It's being held by the guys that did, uh, detective Pikachu. So director Rob Letterman and
6586580	6595060	produced, I guess, by Ubisoft, Jason Allman and, or Altman and Margaret Boykin. So pretty cool.
6596020	6598740	I'm curious if that's going to come up before the sequel does or not.
6599380	6604820	So we'll have to wait and see. Um, the other thing too is, uh, not only is that Ubisoft property
6604820	6612500	getting a Netflix, um, adaptation, but we're also going to get an anime series for splinter cell.
6612500	6619860	That's also coming to Netflix as well. So that's going to be, um, gain 16 episodes over two seasons
6620500	6626980	and it's being written by Derek Kolstad, who was the writer for John wick.
6627620	6634180	And he's also going to be the executive producer for the show as well. That's pretty cool. Um,
6635300	6640500	yeah, I'm surprised lots of good video game adaptation stuff coming to streaming services.
6640500	6646580	So looking forward to this. All right. And then, uh, let's talk a little bit about some
6646580	6651060	free games that we're going to be getting this month or free with subscription service,
6651060	6655220	I should say. So on the PlayStation plus side of things, we're getting fall guys,
6655940	6660980	um, ultimate knockout, which looks pretty cool. And call of duty modern warfare two,
6660980	6666420	uh, the campaign remastered is going to be coming as well. And that's going to be available on August
6666420	6672820	4th through the 31st. And I guess call of duty is going to be a July 20 or a call of duty should
6672820	6679300	be available July 28th through August 31st. So it's already available now. Um, and then from the
6679300	6685700	Xbox live gold side, we've got portal nights and override mech city brawl. Those are going to be
6685700	6692900	coming out for Xbox one and then the Xbox three 60 compatible games, MX unleashed and red faction two.
6695300	6701620	That's it. All right. Let's move on and talk about, sorry, I'm also typing in chat multitasking
6701620	6706900	because, uh, the idea got brought up for a drag race pinball table and I'm all about that.
6706900	6711620	All right. Anyway, that's what I want. All right. Uh, but I want it to be based off
6711620	6716100	of Canada's drag race, which I am now convinced is going to be the superior version of the show.
6716100	6723380	Uh, but I haven't watched it yet. They changed it up a little bit. There's no singular host.
6723380	6728500	It's a panel. So it's, um, uh, Brooklyn Heights, Jeffrey Boyer Chapman and Stacy.
6729460	6735140	And I can't remember her name. She's a very famous model, um, in Canada and she has a very distinct
6735140	6740260	look. She was in the fifth element. Um, and so they're all, they're all the judges and they're,
6740260	6745620	they, they kind of share it. They do everything. Um, and then what they do is that the guest host
6745620	6751300	every week, uh, or the guest on the palace does the RuPaul part. So they, they're the,
6751300	6755220	the guest is the one that comes out and says, welcome to the main stage. How's everybody doing?
6755460	6760660	So it's kind of neat. They kind of put a twist on it. So check it out. All right.
6760660	6765060	We do have emails tonight. So we, we do have the obligation to spare drag race talk. Sorry.
6765060	6772180	Uh, all right. Let's get into some other rapid fire news. And that is, um, an unfortunate follow
6772180	6776900	up to something we talked about a few weeks ago, and it is the dangers of talking about rumors and
6776900	6782580	weird things here, uh, as it turns out. So we had talked about that there was a F zero Twitter
6782580	6786260	account that showed up. And I think some of us were kind of taking the fact that it was F zero
6786260	6791860	with a great assault anyway, but it was that super Mario 35th anniversary one that was like, well,
6791860	6797300	maybe there's something a little more here. And it turns out they were both fake and the F zero JP
6797300	6802660	account basically started shit posting. And as much as we wanted to believe, it just wasn't
6802660	6807700	true. So, you know, sometimes the rumors are right. Sometimes the rumors are wrong and that
6807700	6812820	one was wrong. Um, although it doesn't mean that an F zero will never happen again. Just saying,
6812820	6817780	all right, moving on. Uh, something we do know will happen. This is not a rumor. This is, uh,
6817780	6824340	actual official news is that a new DLC character for soul caliber six sets. Suka will be coming
6824340	6830980	out on August 4th. That will be coming alongside 2.20 update for the game, which will have a new
6830980	6836580	stage as well. And some costume parts that you can use on your own character in the character
6836580	6841220	creator section. A soul caliber six, of course, is on all the different consoles as well as,
6841220	6846260	I don't know if it's on switch, uh, but it's also on a PC as well. Uh, and, uh,
6846260	6852020	Xbox game pass most notably. So I know that's where I have it right now. Um, but if I wanted
6852020	6856500	to get this off to pay a little extra money for it, cause DLC, but it is still a supporting
6856500	6862660	soul caliber series, which is a great fighting game series all these days later, uh, dark soccer.
6862660	6869380	How about you? Oh, we've got some stuff. Um, uh, another game that's a staple in my house
6869380	6876580	is bloodstained curse of the moon too. Um, and there is update 1.3.0. That's available as a
6876580	6881860	legend style where your enemies respond from off screen and one character dying counts as
6881860	6887700	all the characters dying. It's really difficult. They've done some bug fixes and some other things,
6887700	6894500	but yeah, so basically you're getting like hardcore mode. Yay. Um, and then also, uh,
6894500	6899860	they finally have a release date trailer out for battle toes. Like, didn't they bring that up like
6899860	6908100	in 2018? Um, but yeah, finally, um, yeah, it was E3 2018 on the Microsoft announced it and it was
6908100	6912900	supposed to be released last year, but it wasn't. So now we're going to be getting it.
6913620	6918980	So it's, it's weird that it's just suddenly like, Oh, by the way, it's finally coming out.
6918980	6924660	It's just like, Oh, okay. Uh, this is next month and okay. So yeah,
6924660	6931940	this was posted in August, so it's going to be September. So, and via steam and Xbox one.
6932820	6938900	Um, and SSG 100, Matt points out, you can call the evil G and ask when battle toads is coming out.
6938900	6943940	And now they'll give you a real answer. It actually is still August. Uh, I don't
6943940	6948340	know why they said next month. It's August 20th. All right, cool. So yeah, there you go.
6949380	6954660	All right. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates starting in the
6954660	6960980	U S Loki. Well, as I mentioned earlier during, um, the games are remaining free on PlayStation
6960980	6965860	four fall guys, ultimate knockout is going to be coming out on PlayStation four as well as PC as
6965860	6972580	well. Um, then of course, we're also going to be getting fast and the furious crossroads on PC,
6972580	6979220	PlayStation four and Xbox one and horizon zero Dawn on PC. That's it.
6980180	6985300	That's a, that's a big one for a PC. Uh, I know desk stranding came out not that long ago,
6985300	6988660	and I do have some Twitter friends that are playing it for the first time. Thanks to that.
6988660	6994020	So it's kind of interesting seeing the reactions, um, to that, like, like the game is new in a way.
6994580	6999620	Um, let's talk about some Japanese release dates coming to the Nintendo switch in Japan,
6999620	7004100	the coma double cut. That's the name of the game. Uh, it's coming out on the switch
7004100	7010260	monster boy and the cursed kingdom makes its Japanese debut on August 6th and a La
7010260	7014820	Mulana collection. That's right. A physical edition of one and two in a limited edition
7014820	7021620	is also out this week in Japan somewhere. I hear dark Tetsuya going yay. Um, so, cause I know he's
7021620	7027620	a big La Mulana fan, uh, looking at the PlayStation four and the releases over there. Um,
7028420	7032500	well, this is awkward. My computer froze up, so I can't look at them right now until it recovers
7032500	7037940	here. Uh, live technical difficulties. Okay. It's, it's freed up again, but now I'm on the
7037940	7046020	wrong part of the page. Um, but I like to do switch and PlayStation four. No, I got it. It
7046020	7051220	just fixed itself just in time. Uh, we have a watchdogs one and two double pack in Japan.
7051220	7055860	We have a far cry for our cry three and four double pack. We also have the monster boy and
7055860	7060820	the cursed kingdom edition coming out in Japan on the PS four as well. And then a game called
7060820	7067540	VVV tunia. I don't know if that's like a stylized W or something. I do not believe this is at all
7067540	7072900	related to the game VVVVV. Although you might think that at first glance, no, this is more of a
7072900	7078900	anime based game there, uh, where you play melee and shooter characters and hack and slash battle.
7078900	7086180	And yet there is a rhythm thing that you actually team up with virtual you YouTubers and play like
7086180	7090500	a rhythm game in it. So I bet there's some of our long time listeners that are into this,
7090500	7096340	cause it sounds like it's got some music infused stuff in it there. So, all right. Oh yeah. And
7096340	7100580	Dr. Sia says, I've heard of this Bob coffee. It's a Neptune. Yeah. Game. Yep. Okay. So some of you
7100580	7107700	know this. All right. All right. Uh, how about Europe? Darzagra? Uh, Scully on the fourth
7108340	7113940	for everything. All right. The end. All right. Uh, let's go to the mailbag every week. You guys
7113940	7119300	send us emails, participate at orange laundry.com is the place to send us your emails and we will
7119300	7124740	read a few of our favorites on the show. Although if my records are correct, we have a one favorite
7124740	7131460	email to read tonight. Yes, just one. Hi. Uh, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican act
7131460	7137860	deft. Last week, Rob gave his impressions of go Fest 2020. And while I agree with some of the
7137860	7142660	things he mentioned, I do want to give some of my own go Fest for me, wasn't bad at all. In fact,
7142660	7147300	I quite enjoyed both days of it. I will start with the things Niantic needs to improve on.
7147300	7152420	The first being server issues. They really need to upgrade the servers. Oh, sorry. My neck is stiff
7152420	7158420	or be better prepared for events. Um, like this one, because it's not the first time this has
7158420	7164100	happened that the APAC region, uh, get screwed, uh, one way or another for this. When the event
7164100	7169780	started in the Americas, it was all right after the first hour or so they had to handle more
7169780	7175140	than half a day with those server issues. And that's only my main gripe about go Fest. Really
7175140	7181060	the event was pretty good. Um, I will address the biggest complaint that everyone had though,
7181060	7185700	lack of Chinese. It does suck that there were people who didn't get even one, at least during
7185700	7189220	the first day. But the thing is that Chinese shouldn't be given out like they were free
7189220	7194660	candy. Yeah, they should have boosted odds and they did despite popular belief, but what happens
7194660	7199300	with community day Chinese, you end up getting 10, 15, 20, and then you don't know what to do
7199300	7204660	with them. I paid for Chinese. I read in here in some places I say, no, you paid for the event.
7205300	7215700	Um, and yeah, you paid $15 or 280 Mexican pesos or around that $12 us. Um, but you paid for
7215700	7221700	those special, uh, researches two days of special spawns and the team rocket event on Sunday,
7221700	7228580	not to mention access to the special legendary Pokemon like shadow Mewtwo and Victini before
7228580	7235220	everyone else that didn't pay. So for me in the end, it was really worth it. Something that a lot
7235220	7240740	of people don't mention is that a regular go Fest ticket is only one day. Therefore, that's why many
7240740	7246580	people do get a lot of Pokemon and Chinese because you are capturing or checking more Pokemon single
7246580	7253060	session rather than a spread out event like this year's also that a lot of people didn't go out
7253060	7258660	and probably just relied on incense like me to enjoy it. I got 20 Chinese in both days and I'm
7258660	7264180	happy with that, but I'm also happy to have experienced more than just getting Chinese
7264180	7269780	and did more to enjoy the go Fest itself, even under quarantine. So yeah, if you still think
7269780	7274180	that it wasn't worth it or that expectations were way high, you're definitely entitled to that
7274180	7278820	opinion. But my opinion is that I hope that they, uh, that they do this next year and hopefully
7278820	7283460	even way better than what they did now. Thanks for reading this and have a good week, everyone.
7284260	7289460	Thank you. Great email. And you know, not, not everybody has to agree with me a hundred percent
7289460	7294900	at a time and that's fine. Um, so, and honestly, I think everything that active said in the email,
7294900	7300020	like I, I get it like, yeah, you know, the, the comment about the shiny shouldn't be like candy
7300020	7304660	and how irritated do we get when, you know, you get like 11 of them and what the hell are you
7304660	7308740	supposed to do with all that? Those shiny is like, I kind of get that. And I think all that,
7308740	7315620	that feedback is fair for me. I still think the price was a little bit high. Um, but especially
7315620	7321620	when you compare like what the people who paid got and what the people who didn't pay got,
7321620	7325140	which was a lot of the similar stuff when it came to the biomes and things like that.
7325140	7329460	But like, you know what, if it made the game fun and it was something to do for a weekend,
7330020	7335300	it was the cost of a movie or whatever, you know, cool. And I don't, if, if I hated the game,
7335300	7340020	I wouldn't play it. You know, it's all about feedback and, uh, helping Niantic make the
7340020	7343780	game better and all of that. And I think they, there will be a lot that they're going to have
7343780	7351860	to put into next year's event. Um, my assumption is, um, assuming COVID is under control enough in
7351860	7356420	a year's time, let's hope good for goodness sakes, but assuming we're at the point where we can start
7356420	7362420	talking about larger events like that, at least outdoors, um, in a year's time, I, I would see
7362420	7368340	that there's probably going to be a live and virtual event. Why wouldn't there be make money
7368340	7373620	twice? Uh, it would be a great way to do it. So, um, I could see, I could see that the virtual
7373620	7378660	events will probably still be around in some fashion or another. So, um, it'll be interesting
7378660	7385620	to see what comes to that. Um, I will say this for as much as I really dug my heels in and didn't
7385620	7393220	care for the team rocket battling stuff, the day two of the event made it so easy that I did kind
7393220	7399300	of start checking more balloons after the event. And I've kind of been playing it a little more.
7399300	7405620	I mean, anything greater than zero is still greater than zero. Um, and I got really frustrated
7405620	7410420	trying to take out a leader today because they're way harder during the week, you know, during
7410420	7415940	normal playtime than it was during the Go Fest. They were, they were rollover easy during Go Fest.
7415940	7421140	Um, but, uh, yeah, but I mean, of course you don't want the game to be a hundred percent a gimme
7421140	7427140	either. I should be challenged a little bit. So I will say I'm warming up a little bit, just a little
7427140	7432420	bit to that mode. It's still not the bread and butter of the game for me. Um, but I can, I can
7432420	7439300	get into it a little bit. So, um, and as is being pointed out, uh, in chat a couple of places, um,
7439300	7443540	SD100 Matt is saying they did screw up a portion of the game that they plan to redo that portion
7443540	7447140	as a separate event. That is true. Um, and I'm sure you probably had already heard that it's in
7447140	7452420	the end game news, but they are going to be doing a three hour makeup event of sorts, uh, in mid
7452420	7457300	August. I forget, was it the 16th? I don't remember. I could be mixing it up with community day.
7457300	7462740	Um, but they are going to be doing a, a makeup event. So that'll be cool. So, all right. Well,
7462740	7469060	thank you for the email. Appreciate that. Send us more participate at orange lounge radio.com.
7469060	7474100	In the meantime, let's get to some more stories, uh, here tonight. Loki.
7475300	7479540	All right. Um, so this is something I actually have personally experienced myself. So
7480100	7488340	there's been a lot of talk on, um, Twitter recently about the PSPs, uh, batteries
7488340	7493780	swelling, and I've actually had this problem myself. So yes, if you own a PS,
7493780	7500420	I'm sorry. Same. Yes. I was going to say, if you own a PSP, double check your batteries,
7500420	7506260	cause they may have swung or swelled and that's, you want to dispose of them. Um, I've had several
7506260	7512980	batteries in my PSPs. Actually, I think all of them have had to be basically thrown away because
7512980	7518100	they have, uh, swollen. I first noticed that actually with my, I had a Pandora's battery,
7518100	7522660	so there was a battery that you could use to actually hack the PSP. And that one was just
7522660	7529140	ridiculously swollen. Um, so that's unfortunate. Um, if you do play the PSP though, you can get
7529140	7534340	replacement batteries relatively cheap, but it's just, it's unfortunate that that's even a thing.
7534340	7538660	And apparently it is a wide spread issue, but not something that Sony's going to do about it
7538660	7543380	because you know, PSP is really old and I don't know what you're going to do, but it's also not
7543380	7548420	an unheard of thing for anything that uses a lithium ion battery, um, for the swelling to be,
7548980	7552900	it helps contain the content within, it happens to phones. I mean,
7552900	7557140	when you have a battery that's consumed or depleted and you're charging it again,
7557140	7566340	I mean, it's, it's not an uncommon thing across multiple technological, uh, disciplines, devices.
7566900	7572180	Well, all those of you that found our show through olrpsp.com, look out.
7574100	7577940	Well, I mean, yeah, it's just make sure that, you know, if you have your stored in like,
7578020	7582660	you know, somewhere, uh, the check on them, make sure they're not leaking or exploding or close
7582660	7588820	to, you know, breaking, you might want to put a dispose of them, uh, properly. Cause I know
7588820	7593220	I had to, I had to get rid of mine through the hazardous waste stuff. Um,
7593220	7597220	I don't even know if I could find my PSP at this point. Good Lord. I wonder where the hell it is.
7597220	7599940	I think the places like Best Buy will do battery disposal.
7599940	7604180	Yeah. A lot of those places will, I know them that you just drop it off, but,
7604180	7609300	um, yeah, just keep it in mind, especially if you have some of these older electronics that have
7609300	7613140	these types of batteries, you may want to check up on them just to make sure that they aren't leaking
7613140	7620340	or, you know, uh, expanding like this, uh, sucks for anybody that had the PSP go. Cause I think
7620340	7628340	that thing was like built in. Um, I just have the, the PSTV. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that that's,
7628340	7633940	that's safe. I don't know where mine is. I still, I have it somewhere. I just can't
7634500	7640660	solely to play Danganronpa, uh, ultra despair girls. And then we played like that, uh,
7641220	7650980	Tempest, uh, 2000 clone. So like T2K or something. I have mine, uh, specifically right now to play
7650980	7657060	pixel shit. So, you know, there's that, uh, or I'm sorry, pixel poops. I think it was on, um,
7657140	7665780	the PS, the Vita. So, um, so yeah, it's, uh, it is unfortunate, um, that I had to get rid of those,
7665780	7674740	but what are you going to do? Yeah. So breaking news here on OLR, it's not video game related,
7674740	7680100	but it's related to something I always talk about every year. So, you know, how they do the crazy
7680100	7686580	flavors of Lay's potato chips every year, I had no idea they were doing it again this year,
7686660	7692020	but apparently they are because I just got a message from Alan that he has placed in the
7692020	7699700	shopping cart, Nashville hot chicken flavored Lay's and carnitas street taco flavored Lay's.
7700580	7705540	They get me some and I will come pick them up. Those are on their way home right now. And I
7705540	7710580	will be after the show tonight testing, assuming he gets home in time, but then we've been, I will
7710580	7715940	test them live on air. Seriously, Rob, if he's not on his way home back, tell him to get me too.
7715940	7720660	I will pick them up off your porch. Hold on. Feel time for me while I text, please.
7721460	7726660	All right. Cause I'd have to go get them on, um, on Wednesday. I'm on my day off for after work,
7726660	7733140	but I mean, I'm also getting thanks to one of our wonderful listeners. I'm getting a baconator,
7733140	7737380	uh, Pringles and I'm really looking forward to trying them. I haven't been able to find them
7737380	7742900	anywhere. Um, no, I know Dan wants the hot chicken ones. I won't touch those, but the carnitas
7743540	7747460	sounds delightful. There was a couple of other flavors too that look just amazing, but
7748420	7754740	it's funny. Like I eat more chips now than I used to ever eat. I have Calbee pizza chips. I have
7754740	7758180	honey butter chips. I have a bunch of chocolate cause I went to the Rocky mountain chocolate
7758180	7763620	company today that has nothing to do with video games. So, um, no, they do have to do a video
7763620	7769860	games. Cause you know what I do when I play video games, I eat chips. That's why I'm trying to play
7769860	7775460	more GPS games to walk this off to bring up something else about the giggle, the giggle leak
7775460	7784820	too. Um, is it, there was a hockey RPG and it's been talked about before, but yeah, the, um,
7784820	7793220	it w it, uh, there is a, there was a prototype version of this hockey RPG that never came out,
7793220	7797220	came out, come out eventually on the super Nintendo, but it never came out in the
7797220	7803940	Nintendo or the NES. Um, I was gonna say, so one of the things I'm, I normally, uh,
7803940	7810340	like to have is popcorn. Um, and because we threw, we rented a bounce house for my son
7810340	7815060	for his birthday because we can't go anywhere cause of COVID. Um, but we also rented a popcorn
7815060	7822420	machine and so the popcorn machine, you know, we, we try to pop, they, they gave you a ton of
7822420	7829380	popcorn, the pop, and um, I couldn't eat it all. So I popped the rest of it and put it in
7830180	7839540	this giant that I'm going to be eating all week. Love it. Yeah. All right. And Jamie,
7839540	7842820	good news. I think Alan did get my message. I think he's taking care of it. I'm waiting
7842820	7847700	on confirmation. So I can pick it up after work on Tuesday. Yeah, no worries. Just let us know
7847700	7854740	when to put it out. All right. Um, meanwhile, let's talk. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. We can do a trade.
7854740	7859460	That'd be fun. Cause when you do it off a card, you can actually pick what villager leaves. Huh?
7860660	7864660	Yeah. I actually, I think, yeah, I think I, yeah, I have, I have a few extra spares,
7864660	7868740	so I'll just give you my spares. Okay, cool. And I have all the Sanrio cards now,
7868740	7873060	so I think I've already sent you some posters. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Let's move on though.
7873060	7877380	Just got to make sure we get all the stories done. Uh, let's talk about a game that I,
7877380	7881620	I don't know if this game is savable and I I'm kind of curious of your guys' thoughts.
7881620	7886500	Um, but it's the game Anthem from BioWare. Um, and, oh, and I got confirmation from Alan.
7886500	7891700	You're good, Jamie. All right. Thank you, Alan. So, um, BioWare is going to be making some more
7891700	7897540	changes for Anthem and they did a big blog post and, uh, talking a bit about loot. And I think
7897540	7901860	it's worth mentioning because, you know, if you look at some of the games that have been salvaged
7901860	7906980	and they've been salvaged in a big way, you know, No Man's Sky, Final Fantasy 14, one of them that
7906980	7913940	comes to mind is Diablo 3. Um, Diablo 3 had the, um, problem with loot in the early versions of
7913940	7920020	the game. And it was one of the biggest changes they made to the game was to actually, um, sorry,
7921300	7925060	he just sent me a picture with like a shopping cart full of chips.
7926020	7932180	Hell yeah. Looks like, uh, looks like we're smoking weed tonight. All right. Anyway, um, sorry.
7934180	7939380	So loot was a big thing in Diablo and changing that and getting that right was a huge step in
7939380	7944020	making that game better. So some of the things that they're talking about doing in Anthem,
7944020	7950820	um, number one is respecting your time, increasing the frequency of loot drops, making loot viable
7950820	7957220	more often. I know I'm excited about the loot too, Mr. Smoosh, aren't you? Uh, that loot will
7957220	7964900	be viable more often and loot rarities will have value throughout progression. Okay. You can also
7964900	7969860	look for specific loot without having to rely on randomness. So that would be nice. You can also
7969860	7975700	modify your loot, kind of like reforging it, um, make sure that you can reveal and equip your loot
7975700	7982020	right away. Uh, and so on and so on. So they're doing some big changes to loot, but I can't help
7982020	7987780	but shake the feeling that this, this game is already gone. Like this, this game just,
7987780	7994180	they've got to move on. It's not savable at this point, in my opinion, they might try to do like a
7994180	8000260	sequel or an expansion cause that's kind of how Diablo did it. And I could see them maybe trying
8000260	8006100	to do it that way, but I just don't see how Anthem is like, people are going to care.
8008340	8012340	I haven't thought about Anthem in an age. I know, I don't think about it until we have
8012340	8016980	these type of stories. And then I feel like I'm only here to kick it while it's down because of
8016980	8022900	what my feeling is, whether it's true or not about what it did for Mass Effect, you know? So
8024260	8029940	if they would announce that Mass Effect remaster already, I might like be more
8029940	8035380	excited about Anthem. I don't know. Probably not, but, uh, all right. Uh, I was seeing if
8035380	8038180	anybody in chat was talking about it, but they're, they're talking about Mr. Smoosh
8038180	8043620	screaming in the background, which I don't blame them. All right. So let's move in here somewhere.
8044660	8050500	Oh, we had a really, this is not very loud. You missed a dark Sakura after you left,
8050500	8056420	but Stella Loki's cat, like jumped up on him and started like, Oh, did you see it? So,
8056900	8059780	so cute. Oh yeah. That's right. Cause the clip, I put the clip on Twitter.
8062020	8068100	She's sitting right here. Like she wants me to pick her up or feed her or something. I don't
8068100	8073140	know. I'm already switching. I'm switching Midna's food. So she's been kind of weird all day. I'm
8073140	8078500	about to put her on raw food. So I will say it's, it's cropped out of my shot. I'll just quickly
8078500	8085540	peek and show here. I do have the smoosh basket ready and waiting to see if Mr. Smoosh will come
8085540	8092420	back and sit in it as he did that one night. So if he, if he does, uh, my co-host will have to
8092420	8096020	understand that I'm going to cut them out for a minute for Mr. Smoosh to put that onto, or I'll
8096020	8101380	just move my, I'll pan my camera over. I'll be off cam. That's fine. I personally have to pause
8101380	8109060	the feed because, uh, a bandwidth and I'll get distracted. Although like where I have it paused,
8109060	8113460	I've got like this incredible side eye that might be worth a screenshot.
8113700	8117860	All right, let's move on. Dark soccer, you have a new story for us. What's old is new again.
8117860	8124580	Um, yeah. And, um, it's not really super new. The announcement's been out for a little bit,
8124580	8133140	but the analog pocket retro, which is basically, um, uh, a Game Boy, um, it's going to be portable.
8133140	8139860	It also will play, uh, uh, hold on, I'm getting the information about it. So yeah. So, um, it's
8140500	8150100	got a 3.5 inch, um, uh, 1600 by 1440 pixel display. Um, the nano loop music creation software,
8150100	8156660	it can play Game Boy, Game Boy colors, Game Boy advanced games natively. Um, and it's available
8156660	8164820	to pre-order starting on August 3rd, um, at noon Eastern. The analog pocket is, uh, 200 bucks.
8165460	8172580	And there's also a dock which has HDMI out and up to four external controllers for another hundred.
8172580	8180340	It looks really sleek. It keeps that bait that, uh, that Game Boy styling, like more like the, uh,
8181300	8188180	yeah, like the Game Boy color. Um, but it's got that clear screen. Um, and on top of that, um,
8188820	8193140	they, they did do a little bit of tweaking since their first, uh, release of the images.
8193780	8200260	Um, and they have, um, for the, uh, to protect it. There's also a transparent hard case, um,
8200260	8205780	that you can use with it. Um, and then cartridge adapters. So the adapters are really cool because
8205780	8212660	they'll adapt for Neo Geo pocket color game gear and done, done, done Atari links, which I think
8212660	8219700	one of our Atari links has just died. Kind of sad. Um, but at any rate, I mean, I think it's
8219700	8224820	going to be absolutely worthy. Um, I don't know if we're going to get one. We talked about it.
8225540	8231540	Um, you know, I would, I would be happy if it also like had an adapter for, uh, for, uh,
8231540	8236020	turbo graphics games. Cause the screen would definitely be better than that of the turbo express
8236580	8241460	or wonders one. I mean, that would be great too, but I'm not really complaining. It, it looks
8241460	8248580	beautiful. And the, the button shape looks actually pretty comfortable and analog has just
8248580	8259220	made amazing, um, amazing, uh, equipment. So I'm down. I, it looks, it looks really good to me too.
8259220	8263300	Like it's almost one of those things where it almost looks preferable to the original hardware,
8263300	8268420	which I don't say often, but those game boys were kind of bricks. They didn't, they weren't
8268420	8274260	very well lit. It would definitely break. Yeah. You know, they, they ate through batteries and
8274260	8278340	stuff, you know, they were great at the time, but I kind of loved the idea of taking these cartridges
8278340	8282180	and playing them on a device that, you know, and it's not really meant to like modernize the games
8282180	8286740	or anything, but just like make them look nice and crystal clear on a screen. Probably eats a
8286740	8291540	little less power. It's it just, it looks really good. Like I kind of want to get one. I kind of
8291540	8295060	have too much shit in this house already. And I bought an arcade machine this year,
8295060	8302740	but I'm still tempted. See my house, Rob. I know, I know, but you know, there's a lot here and we
8302740	8308340	want to make sure, you know, with some of my older systems, like, well, even the Neo Geo Pocket
8308340	8313940	Color, we had to have, um, you know, the, the lighting on it. Um, we found my Game Boy Advance
8313940	8320900	with its afterburner in it. My, my pink one, like I actually have a pink thing. Um, we found Dan's
8320900	8326580	his afterburner died. Mine still works. So, you know, it's nice to have something that's backlit
8326580	8330340	that will play everything in great clarity. The only reason I would really like want to have the
8330340	8336580	wonders one color addition on it would be to play, uh, the final fantasy games in, in higher
8336580	8342340	resolution. So, all right. Well, we just have a few more stories before we get to wrapping things
8342340	8347380	up tonight with your questions in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash a VOG network. But first
8347380	8353860	Loki. Yes. So there's a pretty cool achievement that's happened with, uh, Metal Gear Solid five.
8353860	8359940	So they have the whole cold war, uh, multiplayer thing that they could do where I guess you could
8360100	8368180	also, um, disarm nukes in the game as well. And apparently there was an achievement. I think once
8368180	8375700	that they had like either hacked to get, um, in the game or a hack to achieve it originally,
8375700	8382180	but then actually now they've finally done it officially without hacks, um, to basically
8382180	8389460	trigger this nuclear disarmament achievement, uh, which is pretty cool. So it happened on the 27th
8390020	8402100	of July. And apparently there was 2,500 nukes total, I guess on, um, I guess on the PlayStation
8402100	8408740	4, there's still 2,500 nukes in the 19,000 on PC, but PS3 one was low enough to where they were able
8408740	8412500	to actually make that achievement happen. But apparently it hasn't happened on the other systems
8412500	8418420	yet, but still pretty neat that people are, um, you know, trying to get that achievement, you know,
8418420	8424340	this what five years after the games come out. Um, I don't know, like, I think the only other
8424340	8427940	team I could think that's kind of like that word. There's a lot of collaboration was probably like
8427940	8431700	nobody, nobody boy where, you know, we have to reach the different planets and stuff for girl.
8432980	8439860	Or that old walking game on the Game Boy Advance. Was it everybody walks or something? I know some
8439860	8443380	game where it was just like a walking device that you kept with you. And then it was like,
8443380	8448100	we have all walked to the moon with how much we've walked. I don't remember the name of the game.
8448900	8455140	That that wasn't like on the, um, DS or anything like how they had like the stuff where it was a
8455140	8461620	3DS or DS that had no 3DS. I think it was on the advance because of that game is where they kind
8461620	8468180	of got the idea to build it into the DS and 3DS. Oh, okay. Yeah. I don't know. But yes, it's, it's
8468180	8472340	an achievement. Um, yeah, I guess we'll have to wait and see when that happens on PlayStation 4
8472340	8478340	and on the PC. It's kind of interesting to me that there's a very loyal community that
8478340	8483300	has kind of worked on getting this achievement and bringing this achievement and making it happen.
8483300	8488740	Um, I'm trying to think if I've ever worked on something like this for an old game, trying to
8488740	8492420	work on some achievement together. I can't think of anything. Can you guys?
8494500	8498180	I don't think I stick with a game long enough to do it. I don't know. Well, then again,
8498180	8501620	I don't know, like some of the stuff I talked about a couple of weeks ago on the show with
8501620	8507380	Ingress and portal scanning. I've done a lot. I broke 300 unique portal scans this week. So,
8507380	8513300	um, I've been doing that a lot still. So I guess everybody has their thing in one way or another,
8513300	8519140	but yeah. So, all right. Uh, moving on, we've got one more story for you guys.
8519140	8524580	And this has to do with, uh, a video game that I don't know. It was one of those games. It was
8524580	8528260	like, I don't know if it was really that good, but it was kind of one of those.
8528260	8536420	It was so bad. It was good. And that was Def Jam fight for New York. Uh, and there were some,
8536420	8540100	you know, different fighters in the game that were based off of real people. One of them being
8540100	8546420	Ice-T, uh, and Ice-T wrote a tweet this week saying gamer stuff. I think they really need
8546420	8551460	to reboot this game for the new consoles and actually put a picture on his feed of himself,
8551460	8558420	basically in a Def Jam fight for New York. And, um, you know, I, I think it's so obviously he
8558420	8561540	owns the game and he plays it sometime or whatever. Maybe, I don't know, maybe it was
8561540	8566420	at a friend's or something and saw it. Uh, but he was all about the idea for a reboot. Uh, this
8566420	8572020	dates all the way back to 2004. It was on PlayStation two, X-Box and GameCube. You could
8572020	8577860	play us like Snoop Dogg and, you know, um, other, other folks as well. We need that game back.
8577860	8587140	Yeah. What? They did reboot it. Um, Def Jam icon. It was a rhythm. It was a fighting game that had
8587140	8594340	a rhythm element to it as well. You could play your own MP3s. It was not good. Okay. But take
8594340	8599380	that element out of it. He mentioned that particular one then. Right. Yeah. This would be
8599380	8604180	a little bit different, but, um, I mean, yeah, sure. Why not? Just because you reboot it once
8604180	8608500	and it doesn't work out. Doesn't mean you can't try again. Well, you know, I mean, it's not like
8608500	8615220	Ice-T doesn't have the type of pull to be able to make something like that happen. Uh, I mean, isn't
8615220	8619780	this, isn't something similar to this, how we got a new Shaq-Fu game at the end of the day? Was,
8619780	8625700	didn't Shaquille O'Neal say something about it? I mean, Ice-T could like have the investment to,
8625700	8631060	I mean, not that I think, you know, he's, he's a normal person who just is very high profile. I
8631140	8635780	don't think he has oodles and oodles of cash, but he might have enough to make a small investment
8635780	8639780	in something like this and make it happen. Especially if he got some of the other,
8639780	8644180	uh, big names that were in the old game kind of together, uh, get the old band back together,
8644180	8650100	so to speak and fund a game like this. I don't know. Maybe. I mean, sure. Why not?
8650980	8656180	Uh, DJ Roma S also points out the Japanese version has different characters. It has Def Jam,
8656180	8661780	Japanese artists in it. SSJ 100 Matt simply says, I take an HD remaster. Jeff Jam, Def Jam
8661780	8666020	fight for New York was great. I think it was still played at Evo for amateur tournaments.
8666020	8670740	Um, so yeah, I think there are a lot of people that remember that game very fondly, even though
8670740	8676340	I, I swore it had really bad reviews. Like it was not like well received critically,
8676340	8679860	but it doesn't matter what critics think at the end of the day. It's what the players want.
8679860	8684180	So it matters if it's fun or not. That's right. All right. Yeah, that's true.
8684180	8689540	SJ 100 Matt says if they put it on Kickstarter, it would fund so fast. Yeah. Why not? I mean,
8689540	8692900	a lot of video games have been doing very well through Kickstarter. So maybe this is one of
8692900	8698100	those games that should take that route as well. All right. If you guys have other questions for
8698100	8701700	us, we'd like to open up the listener round table via chat. So if you have other questions,
8701700	8707540	you can go ahead and put that into chat. Um, for example, uh, in chat we have She-Hulk because we
8707540	8712180	brought up potato chips earlier on the show, which I hear Alan getting home, which means
8712180	8718100	there's chips coming, but She-Hulk says, have you guys ever tried ooze? Am I saying that right?
8718100	8725940	UTZ, ooze, fried dill pickle, ripples, potato chips. I have, I have not, but that sounds good.
8725940	8733700	I like fried pickles. Yeah. I did have pickle chips though. I like Japanese pickles like,
8733940	8745780	uh, or, um, like other delicious pickles. Oh yeah. Alan wanted to make Alan want to make clear.
8745780	8751380	This is not a promotional spot. They're not paying us. I may eat these and they may be garbage.
8751380	8755540	We'll find out later in the show or after the show tonight, live on Twitch, I should say.
8755540	8762500	All right. Anyhow. Uh, ooze. Okay. Sorry. I am not familiar with ooze. I don't think it
8762500	8768100	must be a brand that they don't carry on this coast. It's one of those things where it's like
8768100	8774020	Hellmann's and best foods. They don't carry it across the nation. I did find dill pickle
8774020	8779620	pringles. And if you want them, I'll get them for you. I've had pickle chip. Uh, fried pickles was
8779620	8785460	one of the crazy lace flavors like two years ago. No pringles. No, I'm sorry. It was fried tomatoes,
8785460	8789860	not fried pickles. I'm sorry. I'll get you the, I'll get you the, the pringles. I'll actually buy
8789860	8796260	a pickle product for you. That sounds good. I like pickles. All right. Um, all right.
8797140	8801460	Well, I think, I think we're gonna wrap up the show. Um, but first I want to check in and see
8801460	8808740	if we have any last minute stories from Loki. Sure. Um, so there was some pretty cool stuff
8808740	8816100	that, um, I saw regarding, um, apparently there's a spiritual successor for space quest
8816180	8823540	that is now playable. So it was Kickstarter back in 2012. And it's a game called space venture.
8824420	8831620	And so now apparently you can play an early beta version of it. Yeah. Let's, let's that,
8831620	8837460	that's a long time. That was a lot, but Bobby's in chat saying I'm a backer of this damn project.
8837460	8844420	I got my demo key. Yay. Congrats. Uh, you can check it out now. Um, it looks unique. I mean,
8844420	8853700	I don't, I see, I mean, it looks sort of like space quest, but I don't know. It's not exactly,
8853700	8861300	but neat if it's the same type of gameplay. Um, so I'm down and then apparently the PlayStation
8861300	8871620	emulator, um, R R P C three is now getting, um, network play as well. So they're developing
8871620	8878980	a private PlayStation network server replacement for our RPCN. And apparently it's going to be
8879700	8887060	free and open source and yeah, right now they can play demon souls and bomber man ultra over it.
8888100	8892420	So neat. Um, definitely be cool in the preservation space.
8894260	8900420	Cool. And that's it. That's it. All right. That's it. All right. Um,
8900420	8904420	so that's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio. Thank you guys so much for
8904420	8908260	listening to our show tonight and staying up with us. Uh, we appreciate it. I hope you guys have a
8908260	8912420	great week with playing video games. Uh, if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch
8912420	8916660	radio, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but the voices
8916660	8921540	have to be here for us to put out on air. Uh, so tell a friend or two about the show, um, share on
8921540	8926660	social media that goes a long way as well. Uh, auto hosting VOG network on Twitch goes a real,
8926660	8932260	real long way. Super appreciate that. Um, and yeah, um, we'll be back to do it all again in
8932260	8937860	another week with the episode eight 31 of our show. Uh, before we do that though, we have to
8937860	8943620	go around and get everybody's final thoughts. So, uh, dark Sakura, why don't you start us off?
8943620	8946580	You haven't been here to wrap up the show for awhile. So what's your final thought?
8947460	8956500	Um, my hip hurts. I'm ready to get it like an epidural. I'm tired of feeling like I'm 97.
8956500	8963700	Now I know why old people moved to Arizona. All right. And my final thought, because Bobby's,
8963700	8967780	uh, hooting and hollering in chat is that the beta is not available to the public Loki. You
8967780	8972820	have to have backed it in 2012. It's a personalized beta key. You can watch
8972820	8975540	YouTube videos. There you go. That's how you can check it out. There you go.
8975540	8983700	Play it needs an NDA, right? Well, I don't even maybe it, well, I guess it would be hard to put
8983700	8988980	something like that under NDA. Cause I was gonna say it might actually be, uh, you, you laugh that
8988980	8995620	off, but it might be. Um, but I think if it's anything like blood stained or, uh, several of
8995620	9000900	the other gaming Kickstarters, I think that's kind of too hard to keep contained, uh, something like
9000900	9004900	that. So something else you need to check out though, if, if you get a chance to, there's a
9004900	9010740	lot of preview videos out there now for the new Microsoft flight simulator, 2020. Holy cow. Does
9010740	9017540	that look fantastic? Just the amount of detail is just, it's unbelievable. It's just ridiculous.
9017540	9021300	And I absolutely heard you mentioning that. I thought you said stimulator.
9023220	9032740	Um, no, although I have seen like one of those strange, strange addiction things where someone
9032740	9040340	was in love with a aircraft, um, or certain planes. So yeah, the Pan Am planes I watched
9040980	9046740	and he had bought like the, the catering console. All right. Yeah. That was pretty cool though.
9046740	9051460	Loki, your final thought. I found thought is I'm going to try to be productive over the next three
9051460	9054980	days, at least with something. I don't know what I'm going to be working on, but something.
9054980	9057940	All right. Make it happen. Make it work. Like Tim Gunn says, make it work.
9059140	9067140	I believe Jamie still has a contest open for you. All right. Yeah. All right. That's the way Rob,
9067140	9071460	I was going to let you know. Um, I'm, since I'm not doing, doing drag con anymore,
9072180	9076500	it's looking like if everything is open next year, dragon con will be it for me.
9077540	9082980	Wait, you're going to do dragon con next year. I'm thinking so. And I already know what my first
9082980	9087860	cosplay is going to be. Oh, this is a big news. This is big news. Bobby, you hearing this?
9088740	9094500	I am going to do, uh, uh, Ewok village Leia from return of the Jedi.
9094500	9101140	Huh? Wow. I wonder if this is going to be motivation for more VOG people to make their
9101140	9107380	way to dragon con next year. So that is a very exciting. All right. Assuming of course, everything
9107380	9115300	is safe. Yeah, but that's assuming it's an entire year plus out. So we'll, we'll, we'll have a host
9115300	9119540	of other problems if we haven't that under, if we haven't gotten that under control by then.
9119540	9124740	So, you know, funny asking, is it safe reminds me of the clerk's animated series.
9125300	9131300	Remember that reference a little bit. Yeah. All right. That's it. Roll credits. We're out of here.
9131300	9135460	We will see you next time. Thank you so much for listening to our show tonight and participating,
9135460	9140420	whether it was live or on the podcast feed, we will see you on our discord, on our Twitter,
