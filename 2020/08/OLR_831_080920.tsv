0	14380	There have been various attempts at PC Bumani before, Konami Hawaii's DDRPC in the early
14380	17280	2000s, and the more recent DDRV in your browser.
17280	20940	But on the heels of successful launches of 2DX, Infinitas, and SoundVoltex Cloud, the
20940	22660	next on the list is GITADORA.
22660	26060	Now I'm waiting to hear about three conga drums becoming available.
26060	29660	I may be slightly facetious about that, but that isn't something you'll have to constantly
29660	33540	put up with from your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki, as they bring you
33540	37620	the rest of tonight's news, right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
37620	47140	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where
47140	49140	every gamer has a voice.
49140	56060	We are back once again tonight with Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 831, for this
56060	58780	August 9th of 2020.
58780	62980	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined via Discord, because we're still doing the whole
62980	67640	social distancing thing, with my co-hosts here to talk about video games and gaming
67640	71580	news and all that, starting off with DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
71580	72580	Hello.
72580	74620	Hi, how are you?
74620	75620	I'm okay.
75620	76620	Good.
76620	77620	It's good to see you.
77620	81340	I can actually see you, thanks to the magic of Discord and the television that's over
81340	85220	on the side here, because we do tape- I didn't do anything fancy.
85220	86220	No wigs tonight.
86220	87220	That's okay.
87220	88220	That's okay.
88660	89660	I don't have any makeup.
89660	90660	I'm just me.
90660	91660	You're just a natural tonight.
91660	92660	Normal girl.
92660	93660	Which is all good.
93660	94660	Normal girl.
94660	95660	Normal girl.
95660	98700	Because we do tape live, if you want to see the video, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock
98700	102460	Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, over at the Voice of
102460	106500	Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network.
106500	111780	And for those of you that do tune in on Twitch, you might notice there's a few things that
111780	113460	have changed around a little bit.
113460	116800	Number one, I don't have hair anymore, or a hat.
116800	122240	I had my Britney Spears 2006 moment this week, and I just shaved my head.
122240	124240	I was like, you know what?
124240	125240	Why not?
125240	126320	Quarantine's the time to do it.
126320	127360	So I did it.
127360	130680	And so I thought I'd show it off tonight, because some folks were saying, I don't know,
130680	131680	I'm still getting used to it.
131680	132680	I don't know if I love it.
132680	135200	But some folks on Instagram were like, no, it's a good look.
135200	136200	It's good.
136200	137200	So I'm like, all right, whatever.
137200	138200	We'll try it.
138200	139200	So here I am.
139200	141600	And I have this mic stand here.
141600	143200	So I don't know what to do with my hands.
143200	146920	For the first time in 18 years, I don't know what to do with my hands, because I'm not
146920	148880	holding a microphone.
148880	151000	Instead, I have this mic stand.
151000	156880	And this mic stand was donated by DJ Rama S, our pal over at Anime Jam Session, which
156880	159160	is Tuesday nights here at the Voice of Geeks Network.
159160	161160	A big, big thank you to Rama.
161160	165220	I've kind of resisted the mic stand thing for a long time, just because, well, the way
165220	168360	we've always done it is with the handheld mics, and it works fine.
168360	170460	But you know what?
171020	173780	I need to learn to embrace change a little more.
173780	177660	Because maybe I would have got on the Twitch train sooner if I'd done that, or what have
177660	178660	you.
178660	180420	So if the listeners are like, get a mic stand, then fine.
180420	181420	I will try.
181420	182660	I will try the mic stand.
182660	184100	But I don't know what to do with my hands.
184100	188540	So I might just kind of like have them in the little scared all night or something.
188540	189540	I don't know.
189540	191220	I don't know what to do.
191220	193660	Any suggestions what I should do with my hands, DarkSakura?
193660	194660	Para-para.
194660	195660	Oh, I could.
195660	199100	Maybe if we could play some music, we could do that.
199100	200100	All right.
200740	203980	Let me turn to Tech Master Loki to see if there's any suggestions on what to do with
203980	204980	the hands.
204980	205980	Hi, Loki.
205980	207660	Just do nothing.
207660	209780	I don't know.
209780	211740	Just keep them out of frame.
211740	212740	All right.
212740	213740	Yes.
213740	214740	I will put them down by my sides.
214740	215740	Sit on them.
215740	216740	Okay.
216740	217740	Sit on my hands.
217740	218740	That's fine.
218740	219740	There you go.
219740	220740	Yeah.
220740	227860	DJ Rama S. in our chat room says, your hands are free to hold two adult beverages.
227860	228860	Yeah.
229540	230700	That is true.
230700	233500	And then I also switched out the microphone to a different one.
233500	235940	So hopefully all the sound is still good and all that.
235940	237500	But I think this will work out fine.
237500	240380	I'm into it.
240380	242980	No one special in our chat says, got to say it.
242980	243980	Leave Rob alone.
243980	244980	Well, you know what?
244980	246660	Here's the reality.
246660	252540	I'm 42 years old and God was already making me bald.
252540	256900	And I'm very against using like products and stuff that kind of prey on those insecurities
256940	260780	because if this is the way our maker made us, then whatever, right?
260780	263500	But I just decided, you know what?
263500	267660	Let's just try this, even though I kind of liked having what little hair I did.
267660	268660	I don't know.
268660	270020	The bald thing's growing on me.
270020	271100	It'll be all right.
271100	273580	And some folks in chat are making Hitman jokes.
273580	274580	So sure.
274580	275580	I could do that as a cosplay.
275580	276900	Next Dragon Con.
276900	277900	I'll dress up as Hitman.
277900	278900	I don't know.
278900	280900	All right.
280900	281900	Let's see.
281900	282900	Other comments in chat.
282900	286420	SSJ100Matt says, waiting for someone to suggest for him to hold Smush.
286420	291460	Well, if Smush will come in here and sit in the basket, I'll be happy to, but he's been
291460	293020	kind of keeping to himself.
293020	298220	Mr. Smush, instead of sitting in the basket, he has a new box lid in the hallway and that
298220	299500	is his favorite thing in the world.
299500	300700	It's his new little bed.
300700	302640	He's slept in it all week long.
302640	304300	He loves the box lid.
304300	308700	And the greatest thing about the box lid is it actually says on the side of it, delicious.
308700	313540	So when he's laying on the bed, it looks like he's, all right, forget it.
313540	316200	SSJ100Matt says you can still cosplay as Sami Zayn.
316200	317540	He also has a shaved head now.
317540	318540	Oh, that's good.
318540	322600	I still have the WrestleMania shirt and all that stuff that I wore at that one Dragon
322600	323600	Con.
323600	324600	So there was that.
324600	325980	So, all right.
325980	330020	Anyhow, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight because believe it or not, we do talk about
330020	332220	video games once in a while here on this show.
332220	335480	Let's talk about what happened at the State of Play this week.
335480	341560	So Sony did like a little direct of sorts, if you want to kind of copy Nintendo Direct
341560	344440	style, which is everybody's doing these days.
344440	347640	PlayStation did their own direct, but they were very clear in advance.
347640	349600	No PlayStation 5 info.
349600	350600	This is...
350600	354280	Which means people were immediately disappointed because no one reads those or they expect
354280	357920	surprises just like that last Nintendo Direct where they said, listen, it's only going to
357920	359600	focus on third party titles.
359600	362280	Like why you didn't announce a new Metroid or F-Zero?
362280	363280	What the heck?
363480	365880	Did we or did we not get Godfall though?
365880	368760	So there was a PlayStation 5 thing that snuck in there, wasn't there?
368760	373000	Yeah, but Godfall has been like, they've shown Godfall like several times and it's kind of
373000	374180	boring looking.
374180	375180	I don't...
375180	378220	Am I the only one that doesn't hate Godfall?
378220	379480	Like what I've seen of it?
379480	380480	Like I get...
380480	382200	They don't hate it, I'm just indifferent.
382200	387200	Yeah, I get where people are like, this is kind of like, I look like I've seen this before.
387200	389740	What's so PlayStation 5 about this?
389740	390740	But I don't know.
390740	392520	It looks like a game I might try.
392520	396360	I don't hate it the way the rest of the internet does, but that's, that's how I often feel
396360	397360	about video games these days.
397360	399920	I don't hate it, but it doesn't look interesting to me.
399920	400920	I don't know.
400920	401920	All right.
401920	402920	Fair enough.
402920	403920	Well, what else?
403920	404920	This looks very generic.
404920	409360	Um, so they had a few other trailers, so there's one that I've actually seen quite a few times
409360	413720	with The Pedestrian, which is kind of a platformer game that takes place in Street Science.
413720	416640	That's kind of neat.
416640	420080	There is a new expansion for Control.
420640	425040	Uh, the, is it AWE or AWE, I guess, which is coming out at the end of this month.
425040	426560	The Alan Wake expansion.
426560	427560	Eh, whatever.
427560	428560	Okay.
428560	431840	So the Alan Wake expansion, yeah, that's going to be coming out at the end of the month.
431840	434000	If you're a Remedy fan, that's a pretty big deal.
434000	438920	Like Alan Wake was a game a lot of people slept on unnecessarily and it was really good.
438920	441840	Um, and to be fair, I'm sleeping on Control still.
441840	444360	I just haven't gotten around to playing it, but I really need to.
444360	448600	Like Remedy always has put out, uh, quality products.
448600	451680	Game Break, a lot of people slept on too, and that was a really good game.
451680	457280	So I, I don't, yeah, I don't know what's happening, why people keep, uh, uh, sleeping on the Remedy
457280	459700	stuff, but I want to check out Control for sure.
459700	464400	We got some gameplay footage of Bugsnax, which was interesting.
464400	468360	Yeah, it's like, it's like a first person ape escape, right?
468360	469440	Sort of, yeah.
469440	474680	And then, uh, they announced that Star Wars Vader Immortal is coming to, uh, PlayStation
474680	477420	VR, which makes sense, I guess.
477420	482580	I think that came out originally on the Quest, so it's, you know, it's cool that it's coming
482580	483580	to other platforms.
483580	489620	Uh, Spelunky 2's got a date on the PlayStation 15th, and on the September 15th, it's coming
489620	490740	out on PlayStation 4.
490740	492380	That was a pleasant surprise.
492380	494580	I was really happy to hear that Spelunky 2 is a thing.
494580	498380	I mean, of course it's a thing, but I feel like, you know, Spelunky's been out, God,
498380	499800	that game's been out at least five years.
499800	501340	That goes back probably longer.
501340	507140	It goes back to the early days of the PlayStation 4, and I really feel like that game, like,
507140	511100	kind of like a lot of stuff came after it that really invokes Spelunky.
511100	514500	I don't know if that's just the roguelike thing, you know, like every roguelike feels
514500	517900	like it has some similarities, but I feel like Spelunky really kind of paved the way
517900	522020	of sorts, so it's nice to see it getting, like, an official sequel.
522020	526940	And talking about, like, old games coming, old indie games coming back, but apparently
526940	531620	there's an anniversary edition of Braid being made for the PlayStation 5.
531620	535660	I believe, actually, it's also coming out on other platforms as well, but that's coming
535660	541660	out early 2021, so yeah, they're going to release that on pretty much all the platforms.
541660	547780	I like how it's just Braid Anniversary Edition, because if I am doing my math right, that
547780	555540	game originally came out in 2008, I believe, so that game is 12 years old, so it's not
555540	562380	really the 10th anniversary or the 15th anniversary, it's just an anniversary.
562380	563780	Right.
563780	570220	And then they announced, along with Hitman 3, there's going to be a VR portion of that
570220	574060	as well, so it's going to have a VR mode, which apparently allows you to play missions
574060	578820	from the entire trilogy, so that's kind of cool.
578820	582060	Crash Bandicoot 4, they showed some more gameplay with that, and talk a little bit about that
582060	588820	as well, and it's a direct sequel to Crash Bandicoot Warped, and it looked kind of cool.
588820	589820	What else?
589820	595780	The pathless being shown, so they kind of did a little bit of a gameplay walkthrough
595780	597780	of that.
597780	609020	Let's see, a game called Genshi Impact, and Anno, I don't even know, Mutationim, I guess,
609020	613780	that's going to be coming out on PlayStation 4 at the end of the year there.
613780	622100	And Pele Hanomeo says DLC for Outer Worlds due out this month, but didn't the Xbox series
622100	625620	have that, or maybe they probably didn't date it in the Xbox announcement, but I feel like
625620	626620	it was...
626620	632100	Oh, the Outer Worlds, yeah, I don't think they dated it, no, I don't think it said when
632100	633100	it was.
633100	634100	So now they dated it.
634100	635100	Got it.
635100	639540	And then I know this one was something I saw on PC at one point, but apparently Temtem,
639540	645540	which is kind of a Pokemon clone, is coming to PlayStation 5 next year as well.
645540	648660	That's subtly kind of a big deal, I think.
648660	653860	I know that's a weird way to phrase it, but I think the fact that Temtem has gotten big
653860	658860	enough that it's justifying a PlayStation release to really kind of take on...
658860	664660	I don't want to say take on, but really respond to maybe one of Nintendo's biggest franchises.
664660	666780	I think that's kind of a big deal.
667740	672220	Yeah, and then they showed God of Fall, and then of course there was another announcement,
672220	678420	Hood Outlaw and Legends, which is a medieval PlayStation 5 game coming out next year.
678420	682120	And Auto Chess, apparently there was a trailer for that as well.
682120	687740	So Act F is in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network and is clarifying that the
687740	690420	Temtem release on PlayStation 5 was a Kickstarter goal.
690420	691420	I didn't...
691420	693900	Thank you for clarifying, because I didn't follow that Kickstarter, so I didn't know
693900	695900	that they'd already promised their releases on console.
695900	700340	I still find it interesting, you know, for something that's essentially a Pokemon clone,
700340	706580	to which Act F says it is a Pokemon clone, but it has fallen off, quite off the radar.
706580	707580	I thought it...
707580	710540	Didn't it have some like weird bumps in the road when it came out on PC?
710540	715420	Like I don't want to make stuff up, but I feel like it had like a rough kind of launch
715420	716420	week.
716420	720140	I'm not sure.
720140	725320	Act F clarifies it's early access, so well then problems are to be expected, I suppose.
725320	730120	And then one other confirmation that came out of that as well is that, talking about
730120	732720	backwards compatibility with some of the peripherals.
732720	737200	So they said that basically Arcade 6 and other specialty peripherals will work with PlayStation
737200	744840	5 titles, but DualShock 4, those controllers are only going to be compatible with PlayStation
744840	745840	4 games.
745840	747460	So it's kind of disappointing.
747460	752280	I'm surprised though that that's going to be the case, you know, considering that there
752280	759600	was that extra two back button add-on that they had for the PlayStation 4 DualShocks.
759600	764480	I'm wondering if maybe that's going to add some sort of compatibility with PlayStation
764480	768280	5 games as well, or maybe not, I don't know.
768280	773600	It's hard to say, but has PlayStation ever done the upwards compatibility?
773600	777600	Like the three controllers don't work on a four and twos don't work on a three, so I'm
777600	778600	not...
778600	783480	Yes, they did on the PlayStation 1 controllers, those DualShocks worked on the PlayStation
783480	784480	2.
784480	785480	Okay.
785480	791240	The only downside for that is it may not work necessarily perfectly because the PlayStation
791240	798040	2 face buttons were analog versus digital buttons that were on the PlayStation 1 DualShock
798040	799040	controller.
799040	803320	So for example, I think like Gran Turismo and some of those games actually responded
803320	806880	to how hard you push on the buttons on those.
806880	811120	So that was really the only difference, but I don't think there's that many games that
811120	812120	use that.
812120	816160	And honestly, I used to use my PlayStation 1 DualShock controllers all the time with
816160	818460	PlayStation 2 games and never knows from.
818460	823720	So yeah, that was probably the only time that they had like forward compatibility.
823720	826840	And I guess if you count the PlayStation Move controllers, because they just haven't come
826840	830360	up with something better yet, but that's about the only thing.
830360	833120	Fifth Dream in chat says, consoles come with controllers.
833120	834120	This is fake outrage.
834120	836680	I don't know if I'd go so far as say fake outrage.
837360	842320	I would put it in the category of awe bummer, like, oh, bummer, but it's not a deal breaker
842320	843320	for me because you're right.
843320	845360	I'm going to get a controller with the system anyway.
845360	854520	And it's still a point of contention because you look at like the Xbox One and the Xbox
854520	859440	Series X, the Xbox Series X is backwards compatible with the Xbox One controllers.
859440	861400	You can use those on that system.
861400	866120	So that is something like I know for if you're just playing single player, that's probably
866120	868320	not a big deal because yes, it does come with a controller.
868320	872100	But like, if you're like me, I bought controllers for my entire family.
872100	875680	So that's four controllers I have to replace, assuming I was going to do that probably wouldn't.
875680	880560	But you know, let's say that was, you know, that is an additional expense that I need
880560	883560	to spend money on.
883560	889120	Because if I want to replace that, have that same type of gameplay, then I need to buy
889120	892560	additional controllers, which, you know, hopefully aren't going to be too expensive.
892560	896880	But it's still something like that you're gonna have additional controllers lying around
896880	897880	as well.
897880	899640	It would be nice if they work with it.
899640	900640	Yeah.
900640	901640	But whatever.
901640	905720	That's yeah, that's where my head is that is like, oh, it's nice when it happens that
905720	906720	way.
906720	910760	But it didn't, you know, oh, well, usually they don't like it's more often than not,
910760	913400	they don't work upwards.
913400	914400	So right.
914400	919240	And it can make sense to because I, you know, when you look at the Xbox games, you know,
919240	923320	the Series X, a lot of most of those games are going to launch, you know, on both the
923320	928560	Xbox One and on the Xbox Series X.
928560	932780	So they have to have that compatibility between the two because they're going to be on both
932780	935320	of those platforms at the same time.
935320	936600	Whereas Sony doesn't have that.
936600	940620	And there's additional functionality in those controllers that they can't necessarily do
940620	944040	without it, we kind of break those games if it didn't have it in there.
944040	948500	So I understand it, it's just kind of kind of sucks.
948500	950780	But it's not like it's a bummer bummer.
950780	951780	That's it.
951780	954540	Yeah, it's kind of like, oh, yeah, wish it wasn't like that.
954540	957500	But I also feel like, you know, it'll be offset.
957500	961900	You know, Sony hasn't revealed all the secrets of the controller in the system and everything
961900	962900	yet.
962900	966540	You know, we know there's this thing that the jump right in the game and the potential
966540	970200	to have like shortcuts and things now obviously doesn't speak to the controller.
970200	974460	But my point is, there are things about this system that are still under lock and key.
974460	978300	And I think the full secrets of that controller is one of them.
978300	981480	So maybe it will make more sense once we know all those secrets.
981480	986140	So I'm that's why I'm kind of like, I'm not like, okay, like, oh, bummer, that would be
986140	991000	that would have been cool if it weren't and they do they do work for the backwards compatibility.
991000	994320	So there is that I'm still like, all right, so.
994320	995320	And that's fine.
995320	996740	It works for what it needs to work for.
996740	1000820	I kind of feel like I even though I don't know all of what the controller can do, I
1000820	1004900	kind of feel like it's just going to be basically copying the switch controllers.
1004900	1007960	I think that's just going to be in hand tactics.
1007960	1008960	Just like that.
1008960	1009960	It's like, look, it's so amazing.
1009960	1010960	It's so new.
1010960	1013340	It's like, well, this is exactly what we have on the switch.
1013340	1016660	You know, it's saying it's, it's unique.
1016660	1017660	Kind of did that with the move controllers.
1017660	1018980	Oh, it's a unique thing.
1018980	1021980	We're not copying the Wiimotes, no, not at all.
1021980	1022980	Let's see what happens.
1022980	1023980	There's still going to be more.
1023980	1027340	I mean, obviously, we know Microsoft has got another event that they're going to have to
1027340	1028860	do probably in August.
1028860	1032600	And I imagine Sony's going to need to do the same thing also in August, which is the month
1032600	1033600	that we're in right now.
1033600	1039040	So I imagine maybe sometime around like Labor Day-ish, we'll probably get some dueling announcements.
1039040	1041840	Something a little bit late breaking here, by the way, it's not on our show roll, but
1041840	1045160	something I picked up on Twitter, actually, that was posted to our Discord just minutes
1045160	1047120	before we went live tonight.
1047120	1054760	But apparently a leak has confirmed the existence of an Xbox Series S in addition to the Xbox
1054760	1055760	Series X.
1055760	1059820	And what that leak is, apparently a box for one of the controllers came out and it actually
1059820	1062760	lists the Xbox Series S under it.
1062760	1066280	Now, you still have to take these sort of things with a grain of salt because we know
1066280	1069960	people have gone so far as to Photoshop like boxes and things like that before because
1069960	1070960	people are crazy.
1070960	1072960	Well, they have an actual controller, though.
1072960	1076880	And actually, it's like a retail version of the Xbox.
1076880	1081320	This one definitely seems to hold some water compared to some other things we've seen before.
1081320	1085680	But again, the Twitter fake a couple weeks ago with the F-Zero thing and all that, that
1085680	1086680	was a pretty good fake, too.
1086680	1090040	Well, but that's a more disappointing thing, though, still.
1090040	1096640	Dude, we're in the year 2020, going into 2021, and we're still using two AA batteries for
1096640	1097640	the Xbox controllers.
1097640	1101120	Come on, can we please get some rechargeable batteries, please?
1101120	1103360	Come on, is it going to be so difficult?
1103360	1108720	We've had it for two generations already for the PlayStation.
1108720	1112840	I understand that sometimes those batteries go bad and you have to replace the whole thing,
1112840	1116080	but come on.
1116080	1122360	I think it should be able to be done already, I guess, to keep the costs down, but I don't
1122360	1123360	know.
1123360	1127560	Looking at some comments in chat regarding that Xbox Series S I just talked about, DJ
1127560	1129920	Rama S says, wasn't that leak confirmed months ago?
1129920	1132560	And Bobby Blackwell says, well, I thought that was Lockhart.
1132560	1135320	Yeah, there's been the word.
1135320	1139400	This is not a huge surprise because, yes, the rumors have been out there that there's
1139400	1143160	this other thing they're working on, Lockhart, and it's another console that falls into the
1143160	1148000	Xbox Series S or Xbox Series line.
1148000	1153360	So people are wondering, is S like their discless version of the X?
1153360	1156960	We don't really know what it all entails, but it does seem to be it's going to be a
1156960	1161000	cheaper offering and how they're going to get under PlayStation 5.
1161000	1167020	If I were to guess, it's going to be a redesign of the Xbox One right now, that generation
1167020	1173500	of console put into the form factor of the Xbox One Series X, kind of like how they redid
1173500	1178460	the Xbox 360 at one time to kind of make it a little bit smaller.
1178460	1183700	I could see it something like that because, I don't know, or maybe not.
1183700	1185940	I'm curious to see what Microsoft presents.
1185940	1191920	I do feel like I will myself will probably get a Series X just because I'm a little more
1191920	1195620	of a, I guess, hardcore, I don't like to call myself a hardcore gamer because I'm not very
1195620	1196620	good at games.
1196620	1198260	I just really enjoy them.
1198260	1199500	So I'm a core gamer.
1199500	1204060	I'm just a medium core gamer.
1204060	1210260	And I feel like I'll get an Xbox Series X just because it is the more, you know, it's
1210260	1216740	why I get the nicer iPhone and not the, usually they put out like a more affordable model
1216740	1219800	that's kind of like last year's specs.
1219800	1224460	And that's cool for the people that want that, but I want the fanciest one.
1224460	1229900	So I'll probably end up going with that for Xbox Series X.
1229900	1230900	We'll see.
1230900	1237060	I'm curious what they're doing and what their strategy is overall, that's for sure.
1237060	1240800	And how they're kind of responding to the PlayStation 5 because that competition, even
1240800	1246380	though I don't like the fanboy wars, I don't like the whole PlayStation versus Xbox and
1246380	1249500	the way that people behave on Twitter sometimes, I don't care for that.
1249500	1253500	But just as a fan of gaming and that competition where they're kind of challenging each other
1253540	1255900	to do better, that I like.
1255900	1262780	And so I'm curious to see how the Xbox Series X kind of needles Sony, if nothing else.
1262780	1264300	I'm very curious about that.
1264300	1270220	DJRoma S says, the Xbox Series S is a smaller, less powerful version of the Series X, but
1270220	1275300	more powerful than the Xbox One S. Yeah, that's kind of, again, kind of what we're hearing
1275300	1278020	is that it's probably going to be a little more like an Xbox One, but something with
1278020	1283300	a little more oomph they can play the games a little better, but probably not a disk drive.
1283300	1287340	It's probably one thing that we can guarantee won't be in it, but we really don't know shit
1287340	1290460	until Microsoft has their official unveiling.
1290460	1293180	But maybe this is going to motivate them to get that done faster.
1293180	1294180	I don't know.
1294180	1295180	We'll see.
1295180	1296180	All right.
1296180	1299340	Well, is that it for the state of play?
1299340	1300340	Is that everything?
1300340	1301340	What'd you think overall?
1301340	1302780	What'd you think overall?
1302780	1305480	I skimmed through because I forgot that it was on.
1305480	1309000	I had like meetings during that time, you know, work stuff.
1309000	1310460	And so I forgot that it was started.
1310820	1314340	And so I had to kind of skim through it to catch up to the actual live stream.
1314340	1315700	So I was all right.
1315700	1319700	There's just some things like I didn't care to see trailers for, but like, it's fine.
1319700	1322700	It's not for just me.
1322700	1325220	There wasn't any like huge surprises.
1325220	1327460	It was just kind of, it was what it was.
1327460	1332140	I think it worked nice as a bridge between the two PlayStation 5 events, especially when
1332140	1334460	it comes to PlayStation VR.
1334460	1338500	Because I don't know if you remember when we were talking about that PlayStation 5 event,
1338540	1342660	I kind of commented, I was like, you know, for all that talk about how the PlayStation
1342660	1346740	VR will work with the PlayStation 5, they didn't really show anything when it comes
1346740	1349420	to PlayStation 5 VR and how it works there.
1349420	1353620	Still don't know like what exactly, I mean, I don't know if they have new hardware coming
1353620	1354620	out for that yet.
1354620	1356220	Probably not this year, I'd imagine.
1356220	1357220	We don't.
1357220	1363940	But the fact that VR is still being supported well enough to necessitate a Star Wars game,
1363940	1367460	which is a pretty, I mean, then again, Kinect got a Star Wars game too.
1367500	1372500	It's technically a port, it came out on the Oculus Quest, I want to say.
1372500	1377940	It's still a new release and it still is something to, you know, inject life into the PlayStation
1377940	1383700	VR that says to me, yes, Sony is still pushing this forward, but we'll see what comes of
1383700	1385060	it on PlayStation 5.
1385060	1390780	Because for all we know right now, the PlayStation 5 VR will be nothing but backwards compatibility.
1390780	1391900	That's all we know.
1391900	1393940	But I don't think that really is going to be the case.
1393940	1396500	I think we will see some 5 stuff.
1396540	1397540	We don't know it yet.
1397540	1398540	Yeah.
1398540	1402700	I don't think, I think what you'll see is you'll see a look, hopefully a bump in the
1402700	1407980	performance of it, maybe even like the visuals, depending if the hardware is, you know, more
1407980	1410340	powerful, assuming they come out with new hardware.
1410340	1415540	Kind of like it was a minor bump when you have the PlayStation 4 Pro versus the regular
1415540	1422180	PlayStation 4 in VR, you got some, you know, better definition in the graphics and some
1422180	1425580	frame rates were a little bit better and there's a little bit more detail in there as well.
1425580	1430900	So I'm hoping a little bit of a jump from that and, you know, being able to run those
1430900	1435740	games a little bit better, hopefully see some more immersive games and hopefully with their
1435740	1441140	improved haptics that they have in the DualShock 5, that they will add that to whatever they
1441140	1444380	come up with that hopefully is way better than the PlayStation Move controllers because
1444380	1448380	God, they're so old.
1448380	1449620	Let me read this comment from chat.
1449620	1454140	Fifth Dream over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network says, trying to sell some last minute VR units
1454140	1455780	before they drop it like a Vita.
1455780	1460060	I don't, I realize, um, everybody, you know, likes to give Sony a hard time with dropping
1460060	1462120	hardware because they don't have a great track record.
1462120	1466360	So it's a fair criticism, but I don't see them dropping VR anytime soon.
1466360	1471160	Number one, them reaffirming support for it on the PlayStation 5 is a big deal.
1471160	1474100	You'll notice they didn't say shit about the Vita and the PlayStation 5.
1474100	1476580	We don't even know if you can charge a Vita on a PlayStation 5.
1476580	1481140	So you know, but in all seriousness, when it comes to PlayStation VR, one big difference
1481140	1485760	between PlayStation VR and PlayStation Vita is that PlayStation VR and correct me if I'm
1485760	1490060	wrong and Bobby's in chat, so I'm sure he will say something, but PlayStation VR is
1490060	1492460	the most successful VR headset.
1492460	1493460	It is.
1493460	1496020	They have sold more PlayStation VRs than they sold anything else.
1496020	1499980	Now, granted, when it comes to PC, that market is a little more splintered because you get
1499980	1502700	the vibe over here, the Oculus over here and so on.
1502700	1505260	PlayStation VR is a much more of like, kind of like this baseline thing.
1505260	1510320	There is just that headset for Sony and it's a great entry level VR thing.
1510320	1513920	And Vita was never the number one selling handheld and never got there.
1513920	1516160	Never even got close.
1516160	1520400	And I think some of that is Sony's own mistakes, but that's a conversation for another time.
1520400	1526000	I just don't see them letting go of VR right now because I feel like VR is still successful.
1526000	1527920	They're still number one in that department.
1527920	1528920	And I'm looking at chat.
1528920	1529920	Ah, yes.
1529920	1530920	Thank you.
1530920	1533740	Bobby says they've sold more PSVR units than five Oculus Index combined.
1533740	1534740	That's what I thought.
1534740	1539240	So that is why I don't see them dropping VR.
1539240	1543040	Yeah, I think they'll continue with it.
1543040	1547560	I mean, we see more support for like different games and stuff that are coming out.
1547560	1551240	I'm just curious to find out more about what the PlayStation 5 is going to bring to it
1551240	1553760	versus, you know, the backwards compatibility.
1553760	1554760	Yeah.
1554760	1555760	All right.
1555760	1558280	Well, let's move on and get into some other topics for tonight's show.
1558280	1561960	And we'll talk a little more about what Xbox is doing and Nintendo is doing.
1561960	1565680	But first, let's talk about what we are doing in our gaming weeks and the types of video
1565680	1569440	games that we have been playing this week in a segment called How Is Your Gaming Week?
1569440	1571440	DarkSakura, how is your gaming week?
1571440	1573440	What have you been up to?
1573440	1576680	I have been it's been a busy week for me.
1576680	1584680	We've had some some healthy stuff and I've had doctor's visits and stuff, but they released
1584680	1589240	new puzzles for patterned on Apple Arcade, which, you know, I love that game.
1589240	1590600	It's kind of one of my stress reliefs.
1590600	1596200	I'm going back to playing the moon like mahjong too, just because it's, again, something my
1596200	1597200	list I can do.
1597200	1599800	I'm still doing Animal Crossing.
1599800	1602880	I also have let me look up the word swipe.
1602880	1606440	I know it's like a dumb little game, but this is what it is.
1606440	1611560	And I got interested in playing this from playing Words With Friends, which I need to
1611560	1613060	get back to.
1613060	1615400	But it's just a fun little game.
1615400	1621240	And I get annoyed at it because apparently I have a better vocabulary than the game does.
1621240	1623440	So I like put in a word.
1623440	1625080	I know that's a word.
1625080	1626940	The dictionary knows that's a word.
1626940	1628720	The game doesn't know that's a word.
1628720	1629720	Stupid game.
1629720	1632720	I see screenshots all the time of people with words with friends going, what do you mean
1632720	1634080	that's not a word?
1634080	1635080	Right.
1635080	1639240	Well, I do keep when I'm playing Words With Friends, I actually keep the Scrabble dictionary
1639240	1643480	open to make sure that before I play a word, I'm playing a legit word.
1643480	1644560	That's a different story.
1644560	1646680	This one, they are legit words.
1646680	1648440	I look them up in the dictionary.
1648440	1649440	Yes.
1649440	1651160	I spelled queried, right?
1651160	1652160	Apparently it's.
1652160	1653160	Yeah.
1653160	1654160	Anyway.
1654160	1661960	So, um, however, I got to play one of my favorite words, yurt, do you know what a yurt is?
1661960	1669080	Um, it's kind of, um, octagonal, uh, structure, how structure usually portable, but some people
1669080	1670080	have permanent yurts.
1670080	1671080	Okay.
1671080	1672080	I thought it was like a math thing.
1672080	1673080	Oh, no, no.
1673080	1674080	Okay.
1674600	1675600	Like house.
1675600	1676600	Yeah.
1676600	1677600	Yeah.
1677600	1678600	I've heard of it.
1678600	1679600	I used to want to live in a yurt.
1679600	1680600	So I had a fun time with that one.
1680600	1685600	Um, um, but at any rate, um, I was playing that I'm going to be sitting back down with
1685600	1686600	the last of us.
1686600	1692800	Um, once, uh, I can get some of the pain in my wrist, uh, settled down, um, Dan was playing
1692800	1693800	doom.
1693800	1699740	The other day we got doom on a switch and of course playing on the mode that has my
1699740	1702000	favorite name hurt me plenty.
1702000	1709840	Um, and it's not a yacht, it's a yurt, SSJ 100, Matt, Y U R T.
1709840	1710840	Look it up.
1710840	1714280	Um, also it's a reference to an old, uh, werewolf game.
1714280	1716280	I used to play tabletop.
1716280	1717280	Nice.
1717280	1721880	Um, uh, also, um, speaking of other gaming, um, we switched around some games in the house
1721880	1724600	to now, uh, Indiana Jones is in the house.
1724600	1726240	I'll be putting pictures up soon.
1726240	1728220	Twilight zone is in the house.
1728220	1731540	I don't know why they moved the white bodies in, but they did.
1731540	1736500	Um, and, um, I'm, uh, I don't know.
1736500	1740980	I want to play ghost of Tsushima, but I've got so much else going on right now that it's
1740980	1744060	kind of fallen on the wayside one game at a time.
1744060	1745060	Yeah.
1745060	1751620	Well, and on top of that, um, I'm actually getting wheels in motion for, um, uh, a podcast
1751620	1754300	myself and video stuff with Dan.
1754300	1757020	So we've got wheels spinning in the background.
1757020	1758020	More to come.
1758020	1759020	Yes.
1759020	1760020	All right.
1760020	1761020	On that note, we'll move over to Loki.
1761020	1762020	Loki.
1762020	1763020	How was your gaming week?
1763020	1768700	Um, so my week I played a little bit more Minecraft, of course, um, did that.
1768700	1774620	I did try to do some game development this week, but it was a big fight between, um,
1774620	1776860	uh, unity and myself.
1776860	1780800	So that was the majority of it for like three days.
1780800	1783480	And then, um, also played some Orna.
1783480	1785220	I did play a few other things.
1785220	1787840	So, uh, fall guys, I tried a little bit of that.
1787840	1791820	So I actually did get in on one of the first few days back when the servers weren't complete
1791820	1794760	garbage and played a few rounds of them.
1794760	1795760	It's all right.
1795760	1802280	I, I think the controls are kind of a little, it's a little frustrating at times.
1802280	1808600	Um, but I think that's designed that way on purpose, but it's all right.
1808600	1811400	It's a, it's a, it's a kind of a fun game to play.
1811400	1813240	Plus it was free PlayStation plus.
1813240	1817160	Um, I did pick it up on PC as well so I can play with my son who had no interest in playing
1817160	1818160	with me.
1818160	1819680	So, oh, there's that.
1819680	1822040	And then, uh, uh, what else?
1822040	1823620	Um, oh yeah.
1823620	1824620	So yeah.
1824620	1829200	Then I also got, uh, just like Bobby, the, uh, Lego Nintendo set and I was putting that
1829200	1832520	together on the, um, on Twitch.
1832520	1834760	I saw your Twitch streams pop up on the fog discord.
1834760	1835760	That was cool.
1835760	1836760	Yeah.
1836760	1837760	So, so we did that.
1837760	1841000	So I actually do have, um, you know, it right in front of me here.
1841000	1843760	So it's, it's pretty decent size.
1843760	1848560	As you can see, um, it's got its controller.
1848560	1852800	And then of course, uh, the game itself, uh, super Mario brothers.
1852800	1854320	So you have to lift it up higher.
1854320	1855320	We can't see.
1855320	1856320	I know.
1856320	1857320	I'm sorry.
1857320	1858600	So you have a super Mario brothers right here.
1858600	1863480	And then of course the game console, your green screen effect is tearing it apart, but
1863480	1865440	that's, we're an audio podcast anyway.
1865440	1867440	So yeah.
1867440	1868440	So that's pretty cool.
1868440	1871560	I liked, I liked how they have the little cartridge mechanism in it as well, which is
1871560	1872560	pretty cool.
1872560	1875160	So you can put it inside there and actually snaps down and everything.
1875160	1880680	Um, I'm hopefully going to be doing the, uh, TV a little bit later this week.
1880680	1886040	I also did pick up the Lego super Mario brother sets, uh, that I couldn't do on stream because
1886040	1890040	as soon as I brought it in the house, my son wanted me to immediately build it.
1890040	1895440	So we built that one and one of the expansion sets, I still have, uh, actually it was two
1895440	1899040	of the expansion sets that we built and I still have one more to build as well.
1899040	1901080	And so he is, he's been playing with those.
1901080	1907480	Um, but yeah, it was a pretty cool little toy, so, um, and I really enjoyed the set.
1907480	1911320	Bobby extensively went into the Lego stuff on his show tonight and he said that that
1911320	1916080	TV took like six hours to build and, you know, looking at it, it does look like it's a very
1916080	1917320	like meticulous process.
1917320	1920160	You kind of have to do pixel by pixel, so to speak.
1920160	1923400	Um, but the whole thing, he was showing off the whole finished set up, set up and everything.
1923400	1924840	It does look, it looks really nice.
1924840	1928700	Like, you know, the fact that it doesn't use like rubber bands and the complicated shit
1928700	1934300	that Lego has done before, um, like that it's all very, it's just neat.
1934300	1935300	It's all really cool.
1935300	1936300	How it's all put together.
1936300	1937300	Yeah.
1937300	1938300	I could probably speed run that.
1938300	1942620	So he says the NES took him six hours, took me four to put it together.
1942620	1946700	Um, and then, uh, the TV, I don't know, we'll see.
1946700	1952020	I just, I try to organize myself and just, just knock it out.
1952020	1953020	So we'll see.
1953020	1955100	I don't know, but you got to enjoy it.
1955100	1957620	So, you know, definitely want to take your time.
1957620	1958620	All right.
1958620	1960220	You got that for your gaming week?
1960220	1961220	That is all right.
1961220	1962220	Then my gaming week.
1962220	1965580	Um, so a game I didn't play, but I thought about playing cause I have to respond to this
1965580	1970720	in chat is no man's sky because I was watching Delvin, uh, VG realness in our chat.
1970720	1972340	Make sure you're following him on Twitch too.
1972340	1976040	Uh, he was streaming no man's sky and playing it for the first time and kind of watching
1976040	1977880	him go through it in the beginning.
1977880	1978880	I did.
1978880	1984080	I kind of forget that that game really does throw you in and you always start, and this
1984080	1988380	is, if you didn't know this about no man's sky, you always start on a planet where the
1988380	1990960	atmosphere is kind of hurting you.
1990960	1993760	Like you have a limited amount of life that's ticking down.
1993760	1998660	So you have to be able to move like quick enough to figure out like, Oh, I get my sodium
1998660	2001000	here to refill this and so on and so on.
2001000	2003260	So it's, it's, it's not the most kind thing.
2003260	2007100	Now there are other planets you will find, and if you haven't figured this out yet, Delvin,
2007100	2011340	where the atmosphere is a lot more forgiving and you can walk around for a lot longer without
2011340	2012340	needing that stuff.
2012340	2016300	Um, but I always forgot like, damn, that game really does like throw you in and it can be
2016300	2017300	kind of stressful.
2017300	2020640	But I still think that game is so good and so rewarding and I really need to check out
2020640	2022060	some of the changes.
2022060	2026220	And I thought it was really good, uh, cause quest buster was posting some stuff to our
2026220	2030300	discord, uh, which haven't, if you haven't joined our discord yet, check it out, vog
2030300	2036060	network.com that's vognetwork.com slash discord, uh, and folks chat throughout the week about,
2036060	2038060	you know, things they heard on the show and stuff.
2038060	2042460	And one of the things that quest buster was posting about was, Hey, I went and found when
2042460	2047460	you and Bobby Blackwell for both streaming this game, you built, uh, like houses on voglandia
2047460	2050060	and I found them here they are and here's what they look like right now.
2050060	2051060	And I thought that was really cool.
2051060	2056100	Uh, so it was neat that, uh, quest buster has been, um, going to that too.
2056100	2060660	And yeah, vg realness points out no man's sky is on game pass for PC and Xbox.
2060660	2065500	Um, so if you are a game pass person, it's, it's high time to check that out.
2065500	2066500	It's pretty cool.
2066500	2067780	So yeah, shout out to no man's sky.
2067780	2072420	I, I probably will visit it this week, especially because final fantasy 14 is going to be down
2072420	2074780	all day tomorrow for the big patch maintenance.
2074780	2078900	And then after that, I will probably be playing nothing but final fantasy 14.
2078900	2081540	So I need to probably do no man's sky tomorrow.
2081540	2082540	We'll see.
2082540	2083780	So that's pretty cool.
2083780	2087220	Um, we'll see other things that I've actually played this week.
2087220	2088860	So I played a game called undermine.
2088860	2093580	Speaking of game pass, uh, that game just recently came to game pass on, I know on Xbox
2093580	2096580	one, pretty sure it's on PC as well.
2096580	2097580	Undermine is a rogue.
2097580	2103740	Like it kind of reminds me of rogue legacy, um, but mixed with like the Zelda look like
2103740	2107540	the, uh, the two five D Zelda look, cause it's more like one of those like top down
2107540	2109760	and you're kind of in the dungeon going around the room.
2109760	2112600	So, um, that's a pretty good combination of games, right?
2112600	2116040	If you like rogue likes and you like Zelda, I think that'll be up your alley, which is
2116040	2120380	funny because I also think you have binding at Isaac, but binding of Isaac was a little
2120380	2123500	more, if I remember right, like a shooter kind of like there was a lot more like shooty
2123500	2124980	type of mechanics and different things.
2124980	2128760	I feel like undermine plays a little more like a traditional, traditional Zelda game,
2128760	2133660	but you're wielding like a pickax instead of a sword, but still it, it, it makes sense.
2133660	2137420	Um, so I I've been enjoying it, especially because it's a game pass title.
2137420	2140580	So technically it's like free for me as a subscriber.
2140580	2142500	So I thought that was kind of neat.
2142500	2145320	Uh, one of the other games, uh, I've been playing this week.
2145320	2150320	I checked out fall guys, uh, because that came out on PlayStation and this game of course
2150320	2152900	is doing very well on Twitch.
2152900	2154740	Lots of people are streaming this game.
2154740	2158820	This game seems to be getting more and more, um, kind of like references and pop culture
2158820	2159820	and so forth.
2159820	2163860	Um, I think this game is going to stand to do very well.
2163860	2170620	Um, I think this game is going to follow a very similar trajectory to rocket league.
2170620	2176540	I think it was very smart of the developers to put it out on PlayStation plus for free
2176540	2180460	and I'm using my Cody fingers cause obviously PlayStation plus isn't free, but you know
2180460	2181460	what I mean?
2181460	2185940	They have all these people already playing it and then now these matches are seated,
2185940	2191540	these 60 person matches and it's great because it's a battle royale kind of game, right?
2191540	2193980	But it's not a shooty shooty bang bang game.
2193980	2197620	So like I'm not great at Fortnite because I'm not really good at shooty shooty bang
2197620	2205100	bang since the Duke Nukem and Quake days, but this is more of a, uh, hell style platformer.
2205100	2207420	Uh, and I think it's a lot of fun.
2207420	2212860	I do agree with what you were saying, Loki, that the controllers feel very rubbery.
2212860	2216060	I think that's obviously it's the aesthetic of the game.
2216060	2220420	It's supposed to be rubbery and frustrating character tripping over like every once in
2220420	2221420	a while.
2221420	2223420	Like when I was just jumping and it's like, okay, come on.
2223420	2224420	Like I get it.
2224420	2228460	Like if I hit something then trip, but like just jumping, I'm going to fall over.
2228460	2229900	I guess the game's fall guys.
2229900	2233220	So I mean it makes sense, but it's kind of frustrating.
2233220	2236300	Bobby's also pointing out in chat over Twitch TV slash vog network.
2236300	2239980	They also did the Twitch marketing thing where they spent all their marketing energy
2239980	2242300	on Twitch streamers, big and small.
2242300	2244060	They didn't do the traditional marketing route.
2244060	2247300	So some people were like, man, everyone's talking about fall guys that released today
2247300	2249020	out of nowhere and I don't get it.
2249020	2251980	And I'm like, that's the only thing that anyone's been playing on Twitch for a week.
2251980	2252980	Yeah.
2252980	2256180	And it's a great combination because, Oh, it's free on PlayStation plus.
2256180	2258460	Well, I'm gonna go get that right now.
2258460	2260780	And I think it's going to get a huge install base.
2260780	2265420	And I think the next destination for this game has to be the Nintendo switch.
2265420	2268620	I think we have a story coming up later about, you know, are they going to be looking at
2268620	2269820	other platforms?
2269820	2271620	I don't see how they're not.
2271620	2275500	And I do think if this game connects with the Nintendo switch with their, which there's
2275500	2279420	no reason why it shouldn't, I think it's really going to take off at that point.
2279420	2280420	Yeah.
2280420	2284940	Um, so Xbox is a little more like, obviously it's just an X, you know, the Xbox and PlayStation
2284940	2287300	have more in common than they do different.
2287300	2289540	So I don't think the Xbox is as necessary.
2289540	2293060	I think it will show up there just like rocket league did.
2293060	2297420	But I think the switch is that key component where now you're going to have a lot of these
2297420	2301740	households that only have a switch or there's that portability of the switch.
2301740	2303580	And I think it's going to do very, very well.
2303580	2307060	I hope they consider releasing it really low cost on the switch.
2307060	2308780	Um, I know they can't do it free.
2308780	2310780	I know it's $20 on steam.
2310780	2314980	I think if they can get it even lower, release it for like $10 the first week it's out or
2314980	2316740	something, it'll do very, very well on switch.
2316740	2319100	And I think this game is going to stand to do very well.
2319100	2324980	So again, it's, and if you haven't played the game, it's, it's like you go through these
2324980	2332320	levels that remind you of like either American Ninja Warrior or Wipeout or Takeshi's Castle,
2332320	2333320	you know, take your pick.
2333320	2339140	It's one of these types of shows, but 60 people are running it at once and only the top 43
2339140	2341780	or something like that get to move on to the next round.
2341780	2344180	It's very much Takeshi's Castle.
2344180	2345740	That's exactly the format they use.
2345740	2346740	Yeah.
2346740	2347740	Yeah.
2347780	2349220	The top 30 and then the top.
2349220	2353580	So it's like less and less people get to move on until there's only one winner.
2353580	2358780	And I think part of the reason they can get, get away with giving this game away for free,
2358780	2362380	they don't even need to be charging for it, is that of course there's a shop where you
2362380	2364780	can buy cosmetics or you can buy the coins.
2364780	2369000	You can either earn the coin slowly through playing the game or if you have to have that
2369000	2373380	costume right now, cause it's a special, you can pay real money to have that stuff.
2373380	2377720	It's and again, I think Rocket League is following a very similar trajectory with what it's doing
2377720	2379120	with its cosmetic store.
2379120	2383360	So I know I, I know I keep comparing it to Rocket League when really those two games
2383360	2385520	don't have a lot in common.
2385520	2391400	Well, it does have something very, it does have something very important in common with
2391400	2393680	Rocket League actually.
2393680	2398440	It's very easy to understand how to play, very easy to understand the rules.
2398440	2400320	You don't really have to explain it to somebody.
2400320	2403920	It is like you can watch somebody else play the game, hence why it's doing so well on
2403920	2407520	Twitch and you understand what's going on right away.
2407520	2409980	And I think that is something it has in common with Rocket League.
2409980	2412560	Cause Rocket League is like, oh, it's soccer with cars.
2412560	2413560	Got it.
2413560	2414800	You know, oh, Fall Guys.
2414800	2420460	It's a, it's a wacky, zany level that's going to knock you and send you flying that looks
2420460	2426240	like one of those stupid games Ellen would play on her show, you know, or something like
2426240	2427240	that.
2427240	2429760	And it's that, you know, but survivor style.
2429760	2431160	So it's, it's, it's interesting.
2431160	2436860	I mean, I think, again, I think the game is going to do very well and it, it, it's a,
2436860	2441620	it's sometimes those really simple ideas that do great.
2441620	2444940	And I applaud them for getting to it first, essentially.
2444940	2448660	How do we do a battle royale game, but a silly platformer?
2448660	2449660	There you go.
2449660	2450660	They did it.
2450660	2456720	So, um, orange right in chat says it's like Takeshi's castle or MXC most extreme challenge
2456720	2458100	sold me on the game already.
2458100	2459100	It really is.
2459100	2463460	Uh, pixel pocket says, oh, I know I bomb out on level one about 80% of the time.
2463460	2464460	LOL.
2464460	2465460	Yeah.
2465460	2467580	I haven't gotten past the third stage yet.
2467580	2471020	I have yet to get past the third stage, but I'm not super familiar with all the games
2471020	2472020	yet.
2472020	2476100	And there's the one I fucking hate is that seesaw level.
2476100	2480420	There's a level where you're just running across seesaws, but remember there's 60 people
2480420	2481420	doing it.
2481420	2485660	So if there's too many people on one side, it starts to tilt that way and all those people
2485660	2486740	fall off.
2486740	2491100	So it's, it's, it's really funny when it's not you doing it.
2491100	2498300	I got to the last round in one of the games, like I got knocked around like somehow like
2498300	2502700	I've also had a two where like at the very end of the first stage or whatever, that somebody
2502700	2506300	is waiting there, they're not crossing the finish line and they're like holding onto
2506300	2509300	you trying to like prevent you from crossing the finish line.
2509300	2511520	So I don't know what that's all about.
2511520	2517140	I guess people are trolling people that way, but, um, yeah, it's, it's interesting.
2517140	2520860	Uh, quest buster in chat says, and you don't need to totally dedicate hours and hours of
2520860	2521940	time to it too.
2521940	2525780	I feel like I can play a few rounds for a few minutes and not feel obligated to grind
2525780	2526780	forever.
2526780	2527900	That's very true as well.
2527900	2530480	Like it really only takes a few minutes to play a match.
2530480	2532940	Like you're not going to be dedicating a huge amount of time to the game.
2532940	2534540	And I think that is an asset.
2534540	2535540	Absolutely.
2535540	2539100	And I think also should be very appealing for the Nintendo switch.
2539100	2544580	So long story short, this game needs to make its way to Nintendo switch ASAP.
2544580	2545580	That's for sure.
2545580	2550620	Um, otherwise also been playing a bit of Ingress and Pokemon go and all the location based
2550620	2551620	GPS games.
2551620	2552620	As I usually do.
2552620	2555060	I was out walking yesterday for a very long time.
2555060	2559520	I walked eight miles yesterday and that was all doing Ingress missions while I was playing
2559520	2561020	Pokemon go with Bluetooth.
2561020	2566820	Um, but I caught like nine shiny Magikarp, which, you know, whatever I was more excited
2566820	2570100	because unknown are in raids right now, which is very rare.
2570100	2571700	They don't usually have the unknown in raids.
2571700	2576940	Um, but they had two letters, U and T and I didn't have yet.
2576940	2577940	I had L RNA.
2577940	2578940	It's the spells ultra.
2579300	2585220	So I had L from trading from Shane who had Celebi and uh, I got dragon con a couple
2585220	2586220	of years ago.
2586220	2589740	So the only two letters that were new to me were U and T and I got them both, uh, on my
2589740	2590740	walking adventure.
2590740	2596300	And those are the only two missing the C. Uh, no, it's, it's just ultra.
2596300	2597300	Wob.
2597300	2598300	Rob.
2598300	2599300	Oh, I get it.
2599300	2600300	I get it.
2600300	2601300	Okay.
2601300	2602940	Anyway, but yes, uh, I got the letters I needed.
2602940	2603940	So that's, that's good.
2603940	2608540	I don't know how many unique unknown letters that gives me now, but it's at least 10, probably
2608540	2609540	more.
2609540	2610540	I need to count them all.
2610540	2612540	So yeah, that's, uh, that's been my game a week.
2612540	2613540	All right.
2613540	2618260	We're going to get into some other news tonight and starting off with another, uh, a follow
2618260	2619820	up to the PlayStation stuff.
2619820	2620820	Right?
2620820	2621820	Logie.
2621820	2622820	Yes.
2622820	2628060	So one of the cooler looking games that they showed off during the PlayStation, um, state
2628060	2632140	of play is this game called and must die.
2632140	2635060	And unfortunately there are some drama behind it though.
2635060	2641980	So after the whole state of play event in the show, this trailer off, there was a post
2641980	2646500	on Twitter talking about how this game was stolen.
2646500	2653620	Um, so basically what happened was the, um, studio limestone games who was behind this
2653620	2658900	eight members of that creative team, they had resigned from limestone games in June,
2658900	2665060	um, based on, uh, I guess on hot or hostile working conditions.
2665060	2671260	They had posts a whole, um, set of testimonies in Dropbox kind of documenting the different
2671260	2673460	things that they ran on or ran into.
2673460	2678940	Um, but apparently it's, you know, poor working conditions in the studio behavior of its chief
2678940	2680940	executive.
2680940	2687260	And um, they basically said this trailer was created with abuse, manipulation and theft
2687660	2693020	and people who have worked on every shot of this are no longer in the company, um, holding
2693020	2694820	IP rights.
2694820	2696620	Some were not even paid for their work.
2696620	2702420	The real IP for the game was stolen from the creators BFL play.
2702420	2707900	And then, um, some of the stuff that they talked about in there as well, that, you know,
2707900	2715180	there was very little support, um, from the CEO and they were hiring additional developers,
2715180	2717820	um, to work on the project.
2717820	2725140	And of course it led to severe workload issues and long crunch and all that type of stuff.
2725140	2730300	So it is unfortunate that there's all this kind of stuff, marring this down.
2730300	2734700	And then of course, focus home interactive, which is the publisher of this doesn't really
2734700	2738660	seem to be involved or they're saying that they're not involved with this, but they're
2738660	2741780	looking into allegations regarding this.
2741780	2744020	Um, so it's interesting.
2744020	2748580	It's kind of sucks to see this marred by this and considering that a lot of development
2748580	2752500	talent that was behind the game is no longer at the company.
2752500	2755460	I mean, like, what's that say about the game actually coming out?
2755460	2760820	Is it, is it really gonna be out anytime soon if all of the talent is gone?
2760820	2762460	Or how well is it going to be supported?
2762460	2765300	It sounds like there's, there's little chance of DLC.
2765300	2767780	What happens if there's issues that need to be patched out?
2767780	2772500	I mean, you know, there, there might be enough of a crew left to handle some of those things,
2772500	2777500	but yeah, it doesn't, it doesn't speak very well of the confidence level that people are
2777500	2778500	supposed to have in this game.
2778500	2784460	I mean, it's one thing to support a company that treated its employees so terribly, but
2784460	2790060	the reality is most people looking at the PlayStation 4 don't listen to gaming podcasts
2790060	2792640	or follow gaming Twitter or any of that stuff.
2792640	2795020	They're not going to know that this is going on.
2795020	2798580	So they're going to say, oh, this game looks like something I might enjoy and just buy
2798580	2799580	it.
2799620	2805780	But is that going to, you know, is it going to be a, end up being a bad purchase?
2805780	2806780	I don't know.
2806780	2810700	I guess the, the reviews will tell, um, it'll be interesting to see if the reviews take
2810700	2814140	any of this stuff into account because they really probably shouldn't, but it's going
2814140	2816420	to be hard not to mention it.
2816420	2820280	Like, like maybe it doesn't affect the score, but it's like, oh, this whole other thing's
2820280	2821280	going on.
2821280	2826420	So it made us very curious to see how this game turned out and that whole thing, um,
2826420	2830340	Jack Defton in our chat over Twitch TV slash vog network says, yeah, this whole situation
2830340	2834420	sucks and I think most people following this game have pretty much lost interest, including
2834420	2835420	me.
2835420	2840080	Uh, Questbuster says the games forum on Steam, as small as it is, is filled with posts asking
2840080	2843740	for an official statement or just warning people off from buying it.
2843740	2849440	Ah, that's already not some good signs early on because you do need those loyal fans to
2849440	2851460	kind of push your sales day one.
2851500	2856460	Uh, and if you don't have that, that could be detrimental unless, you know, they've worked
2856460	2859220	out some deal with Sony for really good placement in the store.
2859220	2860220	I don't know.
2860220	2866160	Uh, how do you think this ultimately affects the game's release Loki or dark soccer, anybody?
2866160	2870740	I mean delayed, I don't know.
2870740	2881380	Um, it's, it's not like, like companies haven't lost, um, lost, uh, games before, lost the
2881380	2886460	data for their games, had to rebuild part of it, um, server crashes, et cetera.
2886460	2893980	It's, it's something that a good developer should have a contingency plan for.
2893980	2897500	They should make backups, they should have other copies.
2897500	2899700	I mean, that's just common fucking sense.
2899700	2900700	Yeah.
2900700	2905220	And if they don't and it forces them to delay, then shame on them that their own damn fault.
2905220	2906220	Yep.
2906220	2907220	All right.
2907220	2910860	Well, we'll see what develops with this game, uh, as it gets closer to release.
2910860	2914340	And if the, uh, a company ever puts out an official statement or not, but if they haven't
2914340	2918140	at this point, I'm not sure they will, they might be hoping people will forget, um, by
2918140	2920020	the time the game releases.
2920020	2921020	We'll see.
2921020	2922020	All right.
2922020	2925980	Anyhow, let's move on and talk about, um, another kind of employee uprising.
2925980	2929860	This of a very different sort though, and this with a much bigger company, uh, this
2929860	2934500	has to do with Activision blizzard, you know, um, Activision blizzard just this past week
2934500	2939980	was talking about their quarter two for 2020 record results for growth, which doesn't surprise
2940020	2943780	me that video games across the board are doing very well right now in this whole pandemic
2943780	2944780	situation.
2944780	2947300	You have a lot of folks that are staying at home playing video games, and I'm sure there
2947300	2951660	were a lot of people that re up to their world of Warcraft sub who maybe haven't played in
2951660	2954420	a while and so on things like that.
2954420	2957820	However, uh, some other stuff that's going on at blizzard.
2957820	2963060	It was a recent report by Bloomberg news that showed, uh, that blizzard entertainment specifically,
2963060	2969020	uh, there was a spreadsheet created, uh, this past week that was in response to an internal
2969020	2974220	study that was done on pay disparity and people started filling out this spreadsheet
2974220	2975220	with salary.
2975220	2979620	It was like anonymous, like how much are you making, how much pay increases have you got?
2979620	2983260	And people started filling out with their salaries and their pay increases.
2983260	2987660	And it showed that raises fell well below expectations.
2987660	2993620	Um, the findings found that producers and engineers at blizzard can get six figure salaries,
2993620	2998140	but quality assurance, customer service, barely making minimum wage.
2998140	3003900	Um, some internal dialogue in 2018 showed that, uh, folks were kind of struggling at
3003900	3008460	their pay level, uh, that they, you know, needed more money to get by because again,
3008460	3014260	uh, blizzard headquarters is in Irvine, orange County, not that, I mean, it's not San Francisco,
3014260	3015860	but it's not much cheaper.
3015860	3018380	It's a Southern California is a very expensive place to live.
3018380	3023820	So, uh, yeah, uh, apparently a long time employee of blizzard said to Bloomberg, they
3023820	3031260	are making less than they did 10 years ago because of small raises and lack of overtime
3031260	3032260	hours.
3032260	3033780	They're not working as much overtime as they used to.
3033780	3041020	Uh, but again, that is a very, um, contrast to, wow, we're doing great as a company.
3041020	3042020	Wow.
3042020	3045220	But our employees are finding they're really not making a lot of money.
3045220	3050980	Um, and this went on to, um, and it's not in the story I'm looking at here, but I know
3050980	3056660	the employees were really kind of starting to band together to make some specific demands
3056660	3057660	of blizzard.
3057660	3061380	And I know one of them that I was reading about was they wanted blizzard to come up
3061380	3067300	with employee retention because blizzard was losing so many people to like riot games,
3067300	3068700	the developers of league of legends.
3068700	3072660	I think they're over in studio city or something, but they're also in Southern California and
3072660	3074220	other competition in the industry.
3074220	3079440	And of course, you know, when a long time folks leave that can really hurt morale and
3079440	3083140	trying to have to start over from the, from the beginning and some things and things of
3083140	3084140	that nature.
3084140	3088680	So, you know, blizzard, these employees are starting to make some demands and that's also
3088680	3096780	kind of getting people to see or say, wow, this may be the early form of a union forming
3096780	3097980	in the gaming industry.
3097980	3104120	I mean, we do have a case of employees coming together and unionizing.
3104120	3108380	It's just not under the, uh, an official, you know, thing that they're paying into or
3108380	3111460	anything like that, but they're coming together to make some demands.
3111460	3115380	Uh, and that's, um, pretty, pretty interesting.
3115380	3119340	Um, another kind of, oh yeah, no, I think this is a great thing.
3119340	3120340	And I think you're gonna see what we're coming to.
3120340	3122220	I was going to say one thing.
3122220	3123220	Oh, one thing.
3123220	3124220	Oh, I thought you said good thing.
3124220	3125220	Yeah.
3125220	3126220	What?
3126260	3130700	This goes back to something that actually should be universal in a lot of jobs where
3130700	3132500	you have income transparency.
3132500	3137300	Um, you know, you, you, you work at a place and they say, oh, don't show this to your
3137300	3138300	coworkers.
3138300	3139300	Don't tell them what you make.
3139300	3140300	This is private, blah, blah, blah.
3140300	3143940	The thing is that they don't want you to tell other people so that people will say, oh,
3143940	3148540	I'm not making what I'm worth, you know, for people doing the same job.
3148540	3152940	And I think that we're starting to see a lot more, you know, people in other companies
3152940	3155180	start to be a lot more transparent with their income.
3155220	3156220	And I think this is fantastic.
3156220	3162700	And I really want this to be, uh, considered a, I'd say a more universal example.
3162700	3165820	I would love to see this encourage other people to do it.
3165820	3168940	And I definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely think that this should be the start
3168940	3170300	of a union.
3170300	3173380	The video game industry must unionize.
3173380	3179000	Yeah, there's, there's so much I want to say on that due to the nature of like what I do
3179000	3181300	now for work versus what I did a couple of years ago.
3181300	3184060	But I really don't want to get into my day job, but there's so much like, I want to like
3184100	3186820	elaborate about some of the differences and fascinating things.
3186820	3195220	So, but, well, I will say, as, as, you know, a lot of women have learned, you know, when
3195220	3199300	we start speaking out about our salaries and hearing what our male counterparts are making,
3199300	3202500	um, the income disparity becomes very obvious.
3202500	3208940	What you see from across the range of, of diversity, you'll, you'll find people with
3208940	3211580	different backgrounds making more or less than others.
3211580	3215300	You'll see, uh, it across, you know, the racial board as well.
3215300	3223780	So I really am so proud of all of these people with their transparency.
3223780	3225820	And I just lost dark soccer for a minute there.
3225820	3227020	I don't know if that's a discord crash.
3227020	3228020	Oh, no, you're back.
3228020	3229020	Yeah, it was a weird pickup.
3229020	3230020	Sorry.
3230020	3231580	I was gonna say, hold their asses to the fire.
3231580	3236580	Be honest, be transparent, but I want to see this turn into a movement in the video game
3236580	3237580	industry.
3237580	3238580	Hmm.
3238580	3239580	Okay.
3240580	3247140	Now, I'm not sure if the disparity in gender is something that's showing here, just to
3247140	3248140	be fair.
3248140	3252340	I don't see it in this article here that that is an issue at blizzard specifically.
3252340	3255420	No, I know, I know, but I just want to make that clear.
3255420	3259460	Um, that's a different thing, um, and still bad.
3259460	3265540	Um, but one thing that is brought up is how about Bobby Kotick as the CEO of Activision
3265540	3268900	blizzard and what is he making compared to the average worker?
3268900	3273660	Well, uh, Bobby Kotick made over $33 million in the year 2016.
3273660	3277300	That is over 300 times of the average employee.
3277300	3282060	Now there are some pro labor groups because I think there are folks out there trying to
3282060	3287580	encourage the blizzard folks to unionize and they are happy to represent them and so forth.
3287580	3292180	And they've done some studies, uh, showing that Kotick makes all this money because there
3292180	3298420	are multiple overlapping award provisions that were 96.5 million in bonuses over the
3298460	3299740	last four years.
3299740	3304820	That is more than the total pay of any other CEO in the gaming industry.
3304820	3309500	He makes more in bonuses than any other CEO in the gaming industry.
3309500	3320980	So I think that is, so dark soccer is polishing off her guillotine metaphorically, uh, but
3320980	3327180	I mean seriously, like he's, he's making a lot of money and it's not really fair, especially
3327180	3330980	considering what the other people in his industry are making.
3330980	3336260	And I gotta be honest, blizzard specifically, now I know he's over Activision blizzard,
3336260	3340460	but blizzard specific, you know, well actually Activision has not had a great last four years
3340460	3341580	either.
3341580	3343960	Blizzard hasn't had a great last two years.
3343960	3348780	That Blizzcon a couple of years ago was a disaster.
3348780	3351820	And so, uh, you know, that wasn't good for them.
3351820	3355040	So why is he getting bonuses for how that Blizzcon went over?
3355040	3359000	Why is he getting bonuses for how destiny two launched?
3359000	3361000	Yike.
3361000	3365800	So that is something the employees and so forth will have to figure out, I suppose.
3365800	3366800	All right.
3366800	3369920	We need to, I am just, I'm all for this though.
3369920	3374760	I just want to see people held accountable.
3374760	3375760	That's it.
3375760	3376760	I do too.
3376760	3380600	I think it's great that people are starting to more openly discuss these things in the
3380600	3382120	gaming industry.
3382120	3387560	And you know, I think, I think that the day of reckoning for, uh, you know, basically
3387560	3392800	abusing the enthusiasm of folks wanting to work in the game industry, cause that's what
3392800	3397160	a lot of this amounts to because for so many years it's been, well, if you don't like what
3397160	3400840	you do fucking leave, cause there's 10 kids that'll gladly take your spots.
3400840	3403880	They can work in video games and you know, that's been the attitude in the gaming industry
3403880	3405220	for a long time.
3405220	3410200	And I really feel like the day of reckoning for that is overdue and it's coming.
3410200	3411200	It's coming.
3411280	3418360	The industry is another industry, you know, at the end of the day and because it's such
3418360	3424940	a common aspect now of everyday industry, you know, it's as, it's as common as I'd say
3424940	3428800	any manufacturing job, massive design jobs.
3428800	3429960	It's a big corporation.
3429960	3434840	You know, the, the whole aspect of its economy is, you know, massive corporations, people
3434840	3440440	that are, you know, it's like the thing now is to be the independent developer, making
3440440	3441640	it big.
3441640	3445720	That's really going to be the bit of a rarity just because you can say, Oh, well now I'm
3445720	3450040	working at, at square, you know, or squinnix or, or whatever.
3450040	3451400	Yeah, it's cool.
3451400	3454920	But in the end, you know, it's a job.
3454920	3460280	If it pays your bills, I mean, it would be great to say, yeah, I'd like to work for,
3460280	3463400	you know, um, you know, so and so company, that would be awesome.
3463400	3466960	I love the company that I work for and I find it amazing that I work there.
3466960	3474440	I can't, you know, say who, but at the end of the day, the job that you have is as good
3474440	3475440	as number one.
3475440	3478840	If you enjoy it, number two of the company takes care of you for the work that you give
3478840	3479840	them.
3479840	3484520	Um, Bobby, Bobby Black Wolf in our chat says, I actually work with several ex video game
3484520	3485520	developers.
3485520	3488280	They like working in financial banking software way more than gaming.
3488280	3494760	You know, that's how I feel about radio, honestly, like if you want to, you want to make a comparison
3494760	3495760	there.
3495760	3499200	Cause I used to get asked all the time, especially in the early days of podcasting, especially
3499200	3503040	when we were first on iTunes and we were, you know, showing up on the news and it was
3503040	3507960	really kind of the height of this show's popularity to be quite candid, uh, was when we were one
3507960	3509680	of the first podcasts on iTunes.
3509680	3514480	Uh, I got asked quite frequently, why don't you work in a traditional radio?
3514480	3515920	Why don't you have a great face for radio?
3515920	3518720	Why don't you go work in traditional radio?
3518720	3525280	And the answer is, um, I really like doing radio on my own terms because when I was in
3525280	3530720	college, I studied to do TV and radio on someone else's terms and I didn't like it.
3530720	3536680	I didn't, I don't have the, I mean, I know I get teased sometimes for ego, uh, by captain
3536680	3540520	Matt over at Starboard Power Coupling and stuff, but I don't have the ego you need to
3540520	3543820	thrive in an industry like that.
3543820	3547880	Look at somebody that does very well like Howard Stern.
3547880	3549900	You know, I realize he's controversial.
3549900	3554000	I'm not here to say, you know, good guy, bad guy, whatever, but we can all agree he's got
3554000	3555060	an ego.
3555060	3559380	He loves himself and that's how he succeeds very well in the right over the, uh, radio
3559380	3560380	industry.
3560380	3567060	So, uh, yeah, as you go, but I'm lazy as she went under, Matt says at the end of the day,
3567060	3570540	someone working in a major company shouldn't have to live with four to five roommates in
3570540	3573780	a San Francisco apartment, but I understand that's a different situation.
3573780	3579080	Well, you also have the issue of like San Francisco housing, but that is, as we say,
3579080	3583500	to invoke another famous broadcaster, a whole nother Oprah.
3583500	3586960	So in the meantime, let's go on to the next story.
3586960	3588900	Let's talk about people who are leaving.
3588900	3594860	Actually, just to put that into a little bit of perspective, what I pay in my mortgage
3594860	3602700	for my house is half of what a friend pays for an apartment that's, uh, half the size.
3602700	3603700	Yeah.
3603700	3607220	Just putting that out there for San Francisco versus like where I am in Sacramento.
3607220	3608220	Yeah.
3608220	3611620	San Francisco is, uh, it's, I love it.
3611620	3616940	I love the city, but I, I could not imagine living there the way it is economically right
3616940	3617940	now.
3617940	3618940	It's, it's something else.
3618940	3619940	Yeah.
3619940	3620940	I just, I just visit my friends.
3620940	3621940	Exactly.
3621940	3622940	Love to see my friends.
3622940	3623940	Yep.
3623940	3624940	Hearts.
3624940	3625940	I miss them all.
3625940	3631980	So, um, how about though, as you mentioned other people leaving and this one, um, I've
3631980	3639460	got mixed feelings about it because this person has been just a big part of Capcom for so
3639460	3647340	long, almost 30 years, but, um, Yoshinori Ono has, uh, left, uh, is leaving, uh, Capcom
3647340	3648340	this summer.
3648340	3652820	And he also will have to big message about his thoughts about the criticism made to the
3652820	3653820	Capcom pro tour.
3653820	3661140	Um, since, since, uh, COVID-19, it has moved entirely online, but his statement, uh, he
3661140	3664860	first acknowledged that, which was, I'd say pretty classy and, you know, his quote says
3664860	3668740	it took a long time for us to decide the format for this year, but we believe that conducting
3668740	3673180	the event itself would repay those who have been supporting the CPT, regardless of what
3673180	3674700	format it is.
3674700	3678900	And then he goes on to say, and now after serving almost 30 years at Capcom, I'm leaving
3678900	3680460	the company this summer.
3680460	3685660	This means I will resign my position as brand manager for Capcom's various titles, including
3685660	3686980	street fighter.
3686980	3690460	Um, and he worked on, on a bunch of great stuff.
3690460	3695940	He worked on mega man series, dead rising, devil may cry, but he's really one of the
3695940	3700420	ones who was behind getting street fighter back on this forward motion, starting with
3700420	3705780	street fighter four, um, which honestly, I think I prefer to street fighter five, but
3705780	3706780	I digress.
3706780	3712420	Um, but anyway, um, he, he says he's really excited to see what's going to happen to see
3712420	3720780	what it's like in someone's new hands, but, um, but you know, it is, it is a, a massive
3720780	3722140	torch to pass on.
3722140	3728540	You're going to need someone who can take that up and then he can keep going with it.
3728540	3733640	I mean, but keep in mind, you know, there's also a few things about, oh no, that people
3733640	3735020	don't seem to remember.
3735020	3736660	He got demoted twice.
3736660	3741660	Um, you know, it was supposed to say, you know, one of the things that street fighter
3741660	3746100	six was supposed to be released next year, but the testing ended up being absolutely
3746100	3749660	a disaster and they hired another director to start it over from scratch.
3750180	3757020	He also gave a street fighter cross Tekken, which, you know, pretty much bombed, um, you
3757020	3761500	know, so keep in mind, it's because we're all still waiting for Tekken cross street
3761500	3768780	fighter, but at any, but at any rate, yeah, the, the whole thing is that while he's done
3768780	3774300	a lot of amazing things, he does have some pretty big fails, um, you know, in his portfolio
3774300	3775580	as well.
3775580	3786220	So, um, hopefully him taking a step back might be another revitalization for, uh, for Capcom.
3786220	3790420	I mean, I'd love them to revisit, you know, older fighting games that they did before.
3790420	3795140	Like I would love a red earth, um, you know, to come out like a newer red earth game or
3795140	3797700	just a release of red earth for my home system.
3797700	3802300	I am a hundred percent with VG realness and chat, give us Capcom versus SNK three.
3802300	3806940	That is like probably my favorite 2d fighter period is, uh, CVS too.
3806940	3807940	Yeah.
3807940	3808940	I enjoy that.
3808940	3815100	I mean, I do also though greatly enjoy the Marvel versus, uh, Capcom series a whole lot,
3815100	3820140	but, um, you know what I want them to bring back is I want them to do another Tatsunoko
3820140	3825820	versus Capcom, but like, just weren't there rumors about that, making a comeback like
3825820	3831380	a second game, I guess they just kind of fizzled or better than that rival schools, give us
3831380	3835140	another, um, you've been on that 18 years.
3835140	3836140	You've been on that one.
3836140	3837140	I have.
3837140	3838140	And you know what?
3838140	3839140	I'm fucking right.
3839140	3846260	You know, I'm going to reply to that, say, okay, now rival school three, I'm just going
3846260	3847260	to make a trend.
3847260	3848500	We're going to make rival schools three trend again.
3848500	3849500	Y'all let's get to it.
3849500	3856020	If we made president cat happen, we are going to make rival schools three.
3856020	3858940	There's that ego we were talking about earlier and I was right.
3858940	3859940	And I'm right.
3860500	3861500	I am right.
3861500	3867060	And I will, I will go down with this burning boat fire.
3867060	3869500	You know, I am right.
3869500	3872700	She's she's, she's laying down the blanket on that Hill.
3872700	3874660	Cause she's ready to die on it.
3874660	3876780	Fuck that.
3876780	3881020	I will emulate myself on that Hill.
3881020	3884380	Burning rage of rage.
3884380	3885800	Nothing says, I love you.
3885800	3888900	Like setting the Hill on file fire with my corpse.
3888900	3889900	Exactly.
3889900	3890900	Exactly.
3890900	3896660	And, and there will be a special explosion afterwards where my burning remnants will
3896660	3906420	spell out Kanji for she needs to justice got Gwen, the end, uh, looking in chat for some
3906420	3907420	other comments.
3907420	3911860	Um, somehow we, uh, got off the topic of Yoshinori Ono.
3911860	3913300	Um, let's see.
3913300	3916260	As she, 100 Matt says, I was shocked about Ono leaving.
3916260	3918580	He was the face of street fighter and a really neat guy.
3918580	3921980	I remember him in New York comic con going around the show floor, shaking everyone's
3921980	3924620	hands and posing for pictures and having fun.
3924620	3926820	The guy was always humble and cool with fans.
3926820	3927820	Yeah.
3927820	3931320	He does seem to have like, and I love seeing that guy on stage.
3931320	3933140	Like he, he does have a presence.
3933140	3938900	I mean, I realized that doesn't necessarily mean that's going to translate to street fighter
3938900	3940500	six is going to be great.
3940500	3944820	Like there, those are two very different roles and I don't mean to slander or talk negative
3944820	3945820	of Ono.
3945820	3946820	Cause I don't know.
3946820	3947820	I didn't play street fighter six.
3948060	3949740	I don't know what he's like from eight to five.
3949740	3954580	What I do know is that he is great with fans and he is a real joy to see at these events
3954580	3958020	with his enthusiasm and everything that he does when he talks about the games and all
3958020	3959020	that stuff.
3959020	3965020	So I feel like somebody's gonna snatch him up just to be an ambassador for their product.
3965020	3972920	If nothing else, or he's going to do something on his own, you know, Oh, I should get my
3972920	3973920	tinfoil hat.
3973920	3976620	I need a tinfoil hat or something that I can put on.
3976620	3977620	You ready for this?
3978420	3982420	Do you know, do you know who should hire Yoshinori Ono to do hype?
3984420	3985420	Konami?
3985420	3986420	No.
3986420	3987420	They need something.
3987420	3988420	No.
3988420	3989420	Good call, but no.
3989420	3990420	They need a kick up the ass.
3990420	3991420	American company.
3993420	3994420	Microsoft.
3994420	3995420	Microsoft.
3995420	3996420	Microsoft.
3996420	3997420	No.
3997420	3998420	Yep.
3998420	3999420	No.
3999420	4000420	Yep.
4000420	4003420	Because I, they need more Japanese talent, that's for sure, because that's an audience
4003420	4007220	they haven't managed to draw in ever.
4007820	4008820	I'm just throwing it out there.
4008820	4015820	I think, and I think just no matter what country you're in, his enthusiasm is infectious.
4015820	4016820	Just saying.
4017820	4018820	Okay.
4018820	4019820	All right.
4019820	4021820	SS200Matt says, that's plausible.
4021820	4023420	Well, anything is.
4023420	4025820	VGRealness says, who is Konami?
4025820	4026820	I don't know her anymore.
4026820	4030820	Maybe we'll have some Konami news later in the show, but for now, Loki.
4031820	4032820	Yeah.
4032820	4034820	Let's talk about Rock City instead.
4035420	4041420	So Rock City, of course, most recently known for making some pretty awesome Batman Arkham
4041420	4042420	games.
4042420	4049420	They have announced an announcement that's going to be at DC Fandom, August 22nd, for
4049420	4052420	a Suicide Squad game that they're doing.
4052420	4060420	And right now, they've also registered the domain SuicideSquadKilledTheJusticeLeague.com.
4060420	4062420	That's a mouthful.
4062420	4063420	Yes.
4064020	4070020	So basically, apparently, it looks like the premise based on the crosshairs on the back
4070020	4075020	of Superman's head is some sort of premise that the Suicide Squad, I guess, is going
4075020	4077020	to be going after the Justice League.
4077020	4078020	It sounds interesting.
4078020	4084020	It's almost like a Suicide Squad version of The Boys, I guess.
4084020	4087020	But yeah, I'm down.
4087020	4089020	I guess we'll have to wait and hear the details on that.
4089020	4092020	But I know the Batman Arkham games are pretty awesome.
4092620	4097620	And I, despite the movie not being that great, did like Suicide Squad.
4097620	4100620	So I'm interested.
4100620	4101620	Yeah.
4101620	4102620	I'm curious to see what they do.
4102620	4103620	I'm kind of with you.
4103620	4109620	I'm like, you know, Suicide Squad is kind of like, eh, but as a movie or whatever.
4109620	4114820	But knowing that Rocksteady did such amazing work with Batman, I feel like they will make
4114820	4118620	Suicide Squad into something that would be really good for a game.
4118620	4119620	I'm trying to believe.
4119620	4120620	I want to believe.
4120620	4121620	Yeah.
4122220	4125220	Well, they have the new movie coming, and that looks pretty good.
4125220	4126220	That's true.
4126220	4131220	As Joe and Hunter Matt says, the Suicide Squad game has been rumored for at least five years.
4131220	4133220	That's probably how long it's been taking them to make it.
4133220	4134220	I mean, these...
4134220	4138220	Well, now all we need is a Harry Potter game announcement that's been rumored just as long.
4138220	4140220	It won't get my money.
4140220	4142220	Didn't something leak with that?
4142220	4150220	And it's because the whole J.K., J. Karen Rowling and her constant foot in her fucking mouth
4150820	4152820	and all the shitty things she said on Twitter.
4152820	4155820	I feel like some of that started to leak out with that game that they're making.
4155820	4159820	And some people are just trying to tell EA or whoever was making it, back away.
4159820	4161820	Make a generic wizard game.
4161820	4168820	Don't put Harry Potter on it because she's tying herself.
4168820	4172820	She is setting herself on fire and dying on a really stupid hill.
4172820	4173820	Yeah.
4173820	4174820	Anyway.
4174820	4179820	As Joe and Hunter Matt says, they were rumored to be in development with it since 2013 when
4180420	4181420	it was teased in Arkham Origins.
4181420	4182420	Yeah.
4182420	4185420	I mean, honestly, games take a long time to make.
4185420	4187420	And it's probably in a newer engine or something.
4187420	4190420	It's something where maybe the first game will take a long time, but we'll probably
4190420	4194420	get like three Suicide Squad games over six years.
4194420	4199420	Or they could just do the same action for more Batman games or who knows?
4199420	4200420	Who knows?
4200420	4201420	Anything's possible.
4201420	4202420	All right.
4202420	4203420	Moving on.
4203420	4206420	Something that won't be coming out as soon as we thought, although I'm not entirely surprised
4206420	4207420	by this.
4208020	4213020	But there was a video that was released this week by Intellivision.
4213020	4217820	Tommy was hyping it up and Intellivision was tweeting it out as it was a live broadcast,
4217820	4218820	but it really wasn't.
4218820	4221820	It was a premiere of an edited broadcast.
4221820	4222820	Okay.
4222820	4223820	Whatever.
4223820	4224820	Fine.
4224820	4225820	It was a direct of sorts.
4225820	4226820	We'll leave it at that.
4226820	4228620	It was like an Intellivision direct.
4228620	4232740	And it was fine, but it did kick off with the news that the Intellivision amico was
4232740	4235960	going to be delayed until April 2021.
4236500	4242880	After the original October 2020 launch date and a very personal moment from Tommy Tallarico
4242880	4248120	in the beginning there, where he talked about how the 10 10 20 date was really tied to something
4248120	4251760	that he had promised for his sister and was openly kind of talking about that she passed
4251760	4259880	away and was getting very emotional, which is not something you often see in CEO deliveries.
4259880	4263800	But it was certainly impactful that you could tell that he didn't want to do this, but he
4263800	4265280	knows it's for the best.
4265280	4268240	And honestly, in disclosure, I've already backed.
4268240	4273240	Well, it's not really backing, but I preordered amico or whatever you want to call it.
4273240	4277000	And I'm not mad about this.
4277000	4281840	It's one of these things where it's like, well, it's just another thing that COVID ruined.
4281840	4283060	But I don't blame Tommy.
4283060	4284160	I don't blame Intellivision.
4284160	4286240	I don't blame anything but COVID.
4286240	4289240	I blame our government's mismanagement of COVID.
4289240	4292840	But again, that is a whole nother episode of a different show.
4292840	4298000	So it is what it is and it's getting delayed till April as a result.
4298000	4301640	I do think it's cute that they're trying to get the backer systems out now.
4301640	4302640	What is it?
4302640	4303640	April 3rd, 2021.
4303640	4305700	So it's four, three, two, one.
4305700	4308320	Like Tommy does have an obsession with numbers.
4308320	4313520	I think like he has to have I wonder if he's like marketing sense, Rob.
4313520	4314520	It's just market.
4314520	4315520	It is.
4315520	4316520	It is.
4316520	4320640	But I'm kind of like, well, will he not release games when Friday is on a 13th and I don't
4320640	4321640	I'm just teasing.
4321840	4326040	I'm just having a hard time still being interested in the system.
4326040	4333760	Like I like I watched the whole presentation that they had and not not to say that everything
4333760	4334960	looks terrible.
4334960	4336520	I think things look fine.
4336520	4339800	There are some games that seem interesting, but there's a lot of games that seem very
4339800	4340800	generic.
4340800	4344560	Like it looks like a generic flash game being thrown on the system.
4344560	4349400	And honestly, like that's not what I would want to like throw out there is like bring
4349400	4351400	people in and make them excited about it.
4351400	4355000	There was a there was a shmup game that they had on there looked pretty cool.
4355000	4361480	There was some of the more retro reimagined versions of like I want to say it was Breakout
4361480	4364760	or something that looked pretty cool.
4364760	4365760	I think there's some.
4365760	4366760	OK.
4366760	4367760	So they just very generic.
4367760	4370680	You know, you know, this criticism is coming, though, and I think something you have to
4370680	4374640	remember and keep in the back of your mind is that this system is not for you.
4374640	4378840	I understand that, but it doesn't just because it's an underpowered system doesn't mean that
4378840	4381860	you can't make things look nice or put polish on them.
4381860	4383180	And I guess it's still early.
4383180	4385280	The games aren't out yet, but it is early.
4385280	4389840	And I think, you know, I think some of the games honestly to me are looking good enough,
4389840	4393040	especially for, you know, the fact that none of the games are going to cost over eight
4393040	4394040	dollars.
4394040	4396240	I think the Breakout game looks very good.
4396240	4397920	I think the racing game will be cool.
4397920	4401640	Like I could give or take the cornhole or some of those other things.
4401640	4407240	But I also but I kind of also remember in the back of my mind, you know, he really wants
4407280	4413360	to pitch this to an audience and a household that doesn't usually adopt video games.
4413360	4419520	This is pitching for, hey, how about for family game night on Tuesday, you try this new game
4419520	4421340	from Intellivision Amico.
4421340	4426100	And I think it is a little bit of a gamble, but I'm not so sat on the that he's going
4426100	4427100	to fail.
4427100	4430480	Well, I wouldn't be if I would have preordered one if I thought, oh, he's going to fail because
4430480	4432020	I don't think he will.
4432020	4438500	But I think a big part of the success of this thing is going to hinge on getting the right
4438500	4440640	messaging out.
4440640	4445100	And I think for that reason, the three of us and those you out there listening to this
4445100	4448260	and watching this probably won't be seeing a lot of it.
4448260	4453580	And that's OK, because, again, it's not really for the audience that's looking for gaming
4453580	4456340	podcasts and gaming news and stuff.
4456340	4459400	But if he isn't, you know, some of this came up on Bobby's show.
4459400	4463760	If he's teaming up with, you know, Ellen or well, I guess, you know, Ellen isn't much
4463760	4464980	longer for TV.
4464980	4469900	He's teaming up with Kelly Clark, Kelly Clarkson, let's say, or Oprah, you know, the daytime
4469900	4471840	TV stuff.
4471840	4474300	That's the way to do it and to get into some of those.
4474300	4477540	And, you know, I think this is the type of thing that should like have a booth at the
4477540	4479740	State Fair.
4479740	4485520	And if they're teaming up with MLB, then when they wish they are, then when baseball comes
4485520	4489960	back someday, this thing should be on display at baseball games.
4489960	4493620	If they're teaming up with Sesame Street, this thing should be on display at Sesame
4493620	4494960	Street on ice.
4494960	4498500	When these things come back, obviously, in the pandemic world, we can't think of those
4498500	4499500	things right now.
4499500	4502040	But you guys know what I mean long term.
4502040	4504560	This thing should show up at those types of family friendly events.
4504560	4507340	And I think if that happens, it'll do fine.
4507340	4512040	And for me, as a mid-core gamer or whatever you want to call me, the reason why I'm still
4512040	4517020	kind of interested in Amico, even if, yeah, not all the games look like I'm going to be
4517020	4522320	thrilled by it, but I am really interested in the retro reimagined stuff, you know?
4522320	4528280	And I'm trying to put on my hat for what made Atari 2600 games good or what made the original
4528280	4530080	Intellivision games good.
4530080	4534440	Sometimes it was just a very simple concept that was fun to, you know, like look at a
4534440	4535440	game like Astro Smash.
4535440	4536440	Market dominance.
4536440	4537440	Yeah, well.
4537440	4539920	Market dominance for Atari, sorry.
4539920	4543560	Yes, but even if I were to go back to old Intellivision games, there's a lot of those
4543560	4547160	I could play over and over and over again, like Astro Smash is a really fun one, right?
4547160	4548320	And they're reimagining it.
4548320	4553200	Missile Command is a lot of fun, which is, I know it's weird because the Atari properties
4553200	4557440	are bleeding over into Intellivision with this retro reimag, because, you know, Breakout's
4557440	4561600	coming, Missile Command's coming, and they're Atari properties, but whatever.
4561600	4568040	I still think those games, they're very classic simplicity, easy to explain and get into,
4568040	4571480	I think will lend itself well to that system.
4571480	4576200	We just talked about why is Fall Guys doing so well?
4576200	4578320	Because you don't have to explain it.
4578320	4581480	You can figure it out really easy by watching somebody else do it.
4581480	4586380	And every Amico game, for better or for worse, is going to be like that.
4586380	4590480	And I think there are going to be some winners and some losers, but you know what?
4590480	4593560	Every console has some winners and some losers.
4593560	4600640	Now to be fair and to be critical where I should be when it comes to Intellivision Amico,
4600640	4606100	I think their biggest challenge is going to be Nintendo Switch.
4606100	4611760	And that $250 price tag is going to put them $50 under a Nintendo Switch, which is the
4611760	4617400	other system, and that's the Disney of consoles and what you think of when you think of family
4617400	4619880	friendly games today.
4619880	4626360	Now obviously the big difference is that Mario and Zelda and Animal Crossing and those games
4626360	4629400	are still going to cost you $50, $60.
4629400	4632760	Amico's not going to have anything over $8.
4632760	4638660	The make or break is going to be how well that messaging gets out there that the games
4638660	4641080	are $8 or less.
4641080	4644280	And that is, for me, that is what is key.
4644280	4649280	He's got to get the message out that yes, it's a $250 system, but the games are never
4649280	4651360	going to be over $8, ever.
4651360	4656640	And I think if he can get that out there, that will be what brings in the people that
4656640	4658340	don't usually get into games.
4658340	4662280	Because I think there are a lot of people out there that go, games are $60, I don't
4662280	4664800	want to buy $60 for a game, that's too damn expensive.
4664800	4665800	I can't afford that.
4665800	4670800	Especially if they're pushing to put games up to $70 and you have all the DLC and stuff,
4670800	4673120	then yeah, that'll look really attractive.
4673960	4679600	Ooh, I love this point from Pixel Pacas in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.
4679600	4684640	Rock Band Beatles sold hardcore when they had it on QVC.
4684640	4687600	Not that Rock Band had issues selling to begin with, though.
4687600	4692980	That's a great example of messaging in a place where you wouldn't expect to see it.
4692980	4697400	Or you wouldn't, like as a gaming hardcore fan or what at mid-core, we wouldn't expect,
4697400	4700120	oh, they sell video game consoles on QVC?
4700120	4701400	Intellivision Amico?
4701400	4706900	I hope Tommy's got QVC on speed dial and is booking his appearance on QVC.
4706900	4709200	That's a great idea, honestly.
4709200	4713680	VG Realness in chat, hmm, that's going to be a challenging sell, I feel.
4713680	4718020	Why do I need to pay $250 for a system that only has $8 games?
4718020	4720320	It's going to be a mixed message to some people.
4720320	4723560	So again, I think that message is going to be key.
4723560	4727560	So I doubt Tommy listens to every little thing on the Intellivision, but if he's listening
4727560	4730400	to this, I think that is your key need.
4730400	4736720	You've got to be able to make people clearly understand the games are $8 or less.
4736720	4741480	And you've got to convince the soccer moms and the QVC watchers and the Kelly Clarkson
4741480	4743720	daytime talk show watchers and all that.
4743720	4746760	So all right, let's move on.
4746760	4751640	We got a lot more stories to cover, including something a little near and dear to our heart.
4751640	4756760	Speaking of the retro games, I suppose, of sorts that we used to play, things that Orange
4756760	4759600	Lounge Radio were founded on, right?
4759600	4761720	Yeah, indeed.
4761720	4766840	And this actually is going to be coming for PC, at least what it sounds like.
4766840	4776920	So there is an alpha of a famous Bimani series, one that we love, that's going to be coming
4776920	4783400	to PC, and that is Gitarora, as in Guitar Freaks and Dramania.
4783400	4787800	There is an open alpha that's available for anyone with the Japanese Konami ID, that needs
4787800	4793280	to have to find mine, and they're talking about it's probably going to be a subscription.
4793280	4799120	There's only four songs in the alpha right now, two have them have classic charts from
4799120	4806300	original Gitarora, and then they're also supporting guitar controllers and electric drum sets.
4806300	4811640	So it'd be nice, I mean, I think it would, you know, it's a really neat thing, it's definitely
4811640	4815040	a way to bring that back now, especially for people who can't really get the arcade
4815040	4820520	experience anymore, and there'd be people who miss it, honestly enough, you know, Rockman's
4820520	4823400	kind of dead for now.
4823400	4826160	And SSG 100 Matt says, I hope this isn't a beat and groovy situation.
4826160	4827160	It's not.
4827160	4834160	The fact that it's coming out in the Japanese market is different.
4834160	4838560	Yeah, they're not trying to dumb it down for the US like they did beat and groovy.
4838560	4840560	Yeah, which is insulting.
4840560	4847720	But anyway, and other news related to that, there's gonna there is a pro arcade accurate
4847720	4853200	controller that you can order for release when this when the game's available called
4853200	4855960	the key teller.
4855960	4867600	And it is a white guitar with a brown neck, it looks pretty neat, has the switches and
4867640	4870040	everything.
4870040	4878080	And this is, it looks pretty neat, you know, I'm not I'm not gonna complain about it.
4878080	4882880	It looking at the pictures of it as it's being held, it looks like it'd be nice and comfortable,
4882880	4888120	you know, maybe I'd say a little bit more like what the rock band controllers are, I
4888120	4893120	think they're a little bit a little bit more on on line with that one.
4893120	4895860	It only is a PC one.
4895860	4906260	It's coming from the, the specialist controller, sorry, it's a it's a group that does specialty
4906260	4910020	rhythm game controllers, DJ Dow.
4910020	4912900	And so it looks, it looks really cool.
4912900	4917020	We get, we get a pretty accurate controller, I think that's gonna be neat, although what
4917020	4923060	I'm probably gonna end up doing if I go for all of this is get maybe the, the port converter
4923060	4929500	for my, my current guitars, because you know, I've still got all of my bimani stuff, all
4929500	4935140	of it, you know, and all of it, I'm Jason kind of name checked in the intro tonight
4935140	4940000	that this is kind of the latest PC iteration of what is kind of in a long line of bimani
4940000	4942220	games making their way to PC, right?
4942220	4949620	Because we had Infinitas, we had the sound voltex had a PC version, a DDR, the DDR one.
4949620	4953000	And so it makes sense that this is happening.
4953000	4959240	I still feel disappointment that they aren't trying in Yes, I know I can go make a Japanese
4959240	4960620	account and do all this stuff.
4960620	4963880	I just wish Konami loved me a little more.
4963880	4966360	Like why doesn't daddy love me?
4966360	4972040	That's how I feel about Konami these days like it's like why will Konami not like put
4972040	4977420	the minimal resources to try to give this a US release, especially when these games
4977420	4982220	are at round one arcades, which yes, I know we're not going to right now in a pandemic,
4982220	4984220	but someday we'll go back.
4984220	4989780	You know, and I'm just hoping like, again, I would love to be able to play these games
4989780	4995060	and know that it's in the US it's licensed for the US it's something I'm or it doesn't
4995060	4997700	like it's region free would really be the most ideal thing.
4997700	5000580	I'm not trying to sound like America, no one else.
5000580	5001580	I'm not trying to do that.
5001580	5009180	I'm just trying to say like, I wish it was open to all and made for all you know, what
5009180	5015960	I want to see is having the American market taken seriously again, like how it was going
5015960	5020780	with when DDR was really reaching its popularity over here.
5020780	5024900	Although it makes sense with this being developed by the Japanese division that all the testing
5024900	5026180	would be in Japan.
5026180	5031460	So I'm not really I'm not really I'm sure I'm trying to let it go a little
5031460	5032460	bit because you're right.
5032460	5036100	And this was the same point that was brought up when I when I because I you know, I screamed
5036100	5037100	about the DDR thing.
5037100	5038780	I was so mad about it.
5038780	5043900	And you know, yeah, if it's an alpha or beta, and they're only testing in Japan, okay, cool,
5043900	5044900	whatever.
5044900	5046300	It would be still nice.
5046300	5051900	It would be nice if dad would call me and say I'm sorry, it would be nice.
5051900	5059040	If Konami Daddy would call and say, Son, I'm sorry, I'm not going to see you this year.
5059040	5062680	But I plan to see you next year.
5062680	5067360	Can't Konami make a phone call and say we're working on it?
5067360	5069080	That's all I want.
5069080	5071080	A Christmas card.
5071080	5078040	All right, anything else?
5078040	5082040	I think daddy needs to be spanked.
5082040	5085720	That's been a bad daddy.
5085720	5086720	Okay.
5086720	5089280	You're gonna get us a ban on Twitch for 24 hours.
5089280	5090280	You better be careful.
5090280	5091280	All right.
5091280	5095360	Hey, you're the one to bring it up daddy into this.
5095360	5099680	All right, moving on to our next story quickly.
5099680	5100680	Loki.
5100680	5102120	All right.
5102120	5111920	So another thing that was kind of this came out around the time of the PlayStation.
5111920	5118720	Their little event was a another exclusive character that's going to be coming to Marvel's
5118720	5125360	Avengers on the PlayStation, Spider-Man will be exclusive to Marvel Avengers.
5125360	5134320	And it is probably because that Sony has this, you know, the rights to Spider-Man licensed
5134320	5135960	for like movies and stuff.
5135960	5140760	So I'm sure that they have it also on the console side as well with their exclusive
5140760	5142120	games and whatnot.
5142120	5149340	So apparently it'll be a free update for PlayStation players that's coming out when the game comes
5149340	5157520	out in, I guess, early 2021 is when I guess, yeah, and then apparently, yeah, I'm sorry.
5157520	5161840	So it's going to be exclusive to the PlayStation in September.
5161840	5168960	And then apparently PC and Xbox One players won't get to actually play as that character.
5168960	5171680	So I don't know.
5171680	5173120	That's such a major character.
5173120	5175600	It's kind of irritating that that's the case.
5175600	5179200	But I get it, I guess, because they have the rights to it.
5179200	5184480	But the way I look at it, it's not necessarily that you're basically selling me like an inferior
5184480	5191400	product then on the other platforms is the way I look at that, which is kind of annoying.
5191400	5194720	This shit has happened before, though, and it was annoying that, well, I don't know.
5194720	5196880	It's sometimes annoying and sometimes not.
5196880	5199440	I'm actually going to give you an example of when it's not annoying.
5199440	5201320	And that was Soul Calibur 2.
5201320	5202320	Now that's a throwback.
5202320	5203320	That one's different, though.
5203320	5204320	Yeah, that was.
5204320	5205320	Yeah.
5205320	5206320	Everybody kind of had.
5206320	5207320	Yeah.
5207320	5208320	Everybody kind of had their own thing.
5208320	5211400	Well, do we know that that will be maybe Microsoft will get their own hero?
5211400	5212600	No, I doubt it.
5212600	5213600	I doubt.
5213600	5215800	I mean, right now they haven't announced anything.
5215800	5218440	So I mean, it would be cool if that was the case.
5218440	5223280	I just don't think that there is anything right now.
5223280	5224280	I don't know.
5224280	5226480	It's stupid politics.
5227080	5232760	DGRama S says, and Xbox fans are trying to get a petition going to block that exclusive.
5232760	5233760	Lol.
5233760	5235520	There's always a fucking change.org for anything.
5235520	5236520	Let's see.
5236520	5240560	Quest Buster in chat says Avengers has a closed preorder beta going on.
5240560	5241920	I've seen some streams of it.
5241920	5244000	I have some concerns.
5244000	5249880	That was my general kind of feedback is I don't know that this news is a great thing
5249880	5252560	for this game because I can't help.
5252560	5257440	And I want to just clearly say didn't watch any of the beta streams, haven't played a
5257440	5258440	look at the game.
5258440	5262960	I have I'm in no position to judge this game, whether it's a good game or not.
5262960	5271080	I can't shake this shaking feeling, this sinking feeling that this game is doomed.
5271080	5277080	I hear it like I hear people aren't really impressed with the beta so far, so I don't
5277080	5278080	know.
5278080	5279280	I'm just going to wait for it to come out.
5279280	5280480	It looked interesting at first.
5280480	5286880	And then when I saw the trailer, it's kind of to me looking more like like Elder Scrolls
5286880	5291400	online where like the more trailers and the more information I hear about it, the less
5291400	5293320	excited about it I am.
5293320	5299160	So right now I'm kind of like, eh, it just looks like an average action game.
5299160	5301960	I mean, we'll see.
5301960	5302960	I don't know.
5302960	5309280	I just there's a lot of games for me to play and especially with like Cyberpunk right around
5309280	5310280	the corner.
5310280	5312080	So I don't really care.
5312080	5320600	Yeah, I just I this is just some not good news on top of the pile of I have like I have
5320600	5323240	anthem kinds of concerns for this game.
5323240	5324640	Let's just put it that way.
5324640	5326000	Sorry about that.
5326000	5329600	I'm not there yet, but yeah, it's.
5329600	5330600	We'll see.
5330600	5331600	Yeah, we'll see.
5331600	5332600	All right.
5332600	5336720	Well, if you are still if you're still Team Microsoft, which there's no problem, there's
5336720	5338120	plenty of reasons to be Team Microsoft.
5338120	5340200	Oh, I want to read this comment real fast.
5340200	5343480	VG realness and chat says, I was already met about the game.
5343480	5346880	Now the announcement about Spider-Man, I'm just very met about it.
5346880	5348800	I feel like it needs more character options.
5348800	5351160	I don't feel like playing the ones they have.
5351160	5352840	Not enough diversity in the characters.
5352840	5354800	They're all punchy, punchy, throwy, throwy.
5354800	5361320	OK, not all, but most pod culture says Mr. Smoosh is the Xbox exclusive character.
5361320	5362320	We could dream.
5362320	5363320	We could dream.
5363320	5364320	All right.
5364320	5366840	Anyway, I want to talk a little bit, though, about what's going on on the Microsoft side
5366840	5370600	of things, because even if they don't have exclusive content for the Avengers yet, they
5370600	5376640	do have something pretty big happening on September 15th, and that is Project X Cloud.
5376640	5381840	Project X Cloud is going to be launching on September 15th on Android devices.
5381840	5385600	There is some controversy definitely going around because apparently Apple is not allowing
5385600	5387200	it through.
5387200	5392340	We'll see if they'll work that out by September 15th, because, again, and I'll kind of let
5392340	5394040	Bobby show kind of speak to this.
5394040	5397880	I feel like if Spotify got their way eventually, Netflix got their way eventually, I feel like
5397880	5399440	this is going to get worked out, too.
5399440	5403760	But as it stands, it's only coming out on Android devices on September 15th.
5403760	5409320	An Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription.
5409320	5413840	So not if you are PC only and not if you are Xbox only.
5413840	5417520	You have to have an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription.
5417520	5422400	So if you have this, it will allow you to unlock the game streaming on X Cloud.
5422760	5429400	Ultimate, of course, will set you back $15 a month after initial offers to get you hooked.
5429400	5435840	Over I guess 100 games are going to be included, but they're not saying the whole library yet.
5435840	5438960	But that could also be because games come and go on Game Pass.
5438960	5439960	Don't know about that.
5439960	5440960	Yeah, probably.
5440960	5447920	I don't think that they're, like, blocking anything unless there's, like, I don't think
5447920	5451560	there has been unless there's, like, somebody that has, like, I have exclusive streaming
5451560	5457560	rights with, like, the Nvidia platform or whatever it is, or like EA, you know, like,
5457560	5460640	we want our own streaming platform, which I think they have their own streaming ones
5460640	5461640	that they're trying to do.
5461640	5464480	Maybe they're like, well, we don't want you to stream our games or something.
5464480	5469320	Regardless, I think it's pretty safe to say all the Microsoft Game Studio stuff is not
5469320	5470320	going to be a problem.
5470320	5471920	And that's that's your halos.
5471920	5473320	That's your Gears of War.
5473320	5476240	That's your Fable reboot and all this stuff.
5476240	5479240	That's that's what a lot of people are going to be checking out anyway.
5479240	5480800	You know, so we'll see.
5480800	5482680	We'll see what kind of slips through the cracks otherwise.
5482680	5486240	Now, X Cloud is also supposed to be coming to PC later this year.
5486240	5490160	So you'll be able to stream game pass titles to desktop or laptop, which is weird because
5490160	5492640	you can download a lot of the same games.
5492640	5496020	But I understand, you know, just based on people's setup or what have you, they might
5496020	5499160	want to stream to like a laptop or or who knows what.
5499160	5504240	So yeah, we'll have to check that out when X Cloud comes out on September 15th.
5504240	5505760	So we'll see.
5505760	5509480	I know a lot of people that have been playing with the early beta and stuff speak very favorably
5509480	5510480	of it.
5510480	5514040	So I'm curious to try it myself and see how it works out.
5514040	5519240	Or those fancy new phones that are being released as well, you know, what do you mean you stream
5519240	5520240	to those?
5520240	5521240	Oh, yeah.
5521240	5522240	Yeah.
5522240	5523240	So.
5523240	5524240	All right.
5524240	5525240	I think.
5525240	5526240	Are you going to go Dark Sakura?
5526240	5527240	I know you had a little spill there.
5527240	5528240	So you're you're cleaning off cam.
5528240	5529240	OK.
5529240	5536280	I have some older kimono fabric that got soda on it, which means it went right in the gentle
5536280	5537280	cycle.
5537280	5538280	Yikes.
5538280	5539280	Yikes.
5539280	5540280	All right.
5541080	5542080	All right.
5542080	5546840	Meanwhile, let's get to the classic game of the week then where every week here on the
5546840	5553080	show, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, kids,
5553080	5554080	get off my lawn.
5554080	5555320	Number one.
5555320	5558800	Number two, watch me do a trick on this hill.
5558800	5562560	Number three, go check out this classic game where she's going to walk into the gaming
5562560	5566840	vault and find a game that she thinks all the kids should be checking out.
5566840	5568840	And I have a few copies of it.
5568880	5571800	And I think this one is one that a lot of our listeners will remember.
5571800	5573600	This is a very transformative kind of game.
5573600	5575600	What is the classic game of the week?
5575600	5578440	Classic game is Virtua Racing.
5578440	5584240	So you've also seen it as VR, but it is a Formula One racing arcade game that was developed
5584240	5587940	by Sega and two and released in 1992.
5587940	5593880	It was originally considered to be a proof of concept for trying 3D graphics, which was
5593880	5598560	supposed to be under the Model 1 because it looked so good.
5598560	5607560	They actually fully developed it as a standalone title and it was full 3D, which I mean, MAMCO
5607560	5608560	did it first.
5608560	5611600	They did winning run and then Atari had hard drive in.
5611600	5617180	But this was like a vast improvement over those.
5617180	5623480	It actually ran relatively smoothly in 3D and it pretty much is considered the foundational
5623480	5632240	game for 3D racing games in general and for using polygon graphics for games going forward.
5632240	5633240	Yeah.
5633240	5638480	I mean, looking at the footage of this game that we're watching on Twitch, to hear you
5638480	5643000	say this is 1992, that's the early days of the Super Nintendo.
5643000	5646680	So it's like putting this side by side with F-Zero is it's like, dang, these graphics
5646680	5647680	are real.
5647680	5649260	But I also remember this arcade game.
5649260	5652680	This was like you had to pay a whole dollar to play this game.
5652680	5657720	It was not a cheap arcade game, you know, and it maybe it's probably showing its warts
5657720	5661560	all these years later, like the draw, you know, things kind of pop in, the draw distance
5661560	5662560	isn't amazing, all that.
5662560	5670440	But again, if you put it in your 1992 hat, like this game for its time was transformative.
5670440	5673320	This is what led to Grand Theft Auto and everything else.
5673320	5674320	Sorry, go ahead.
5674320	5681500	Well, and even for the games that followed, I mean, like Sega Rally, for example, Daytona,
5681500	5687540	you know, while those were all textured, you know, this one here is in its beautiful
5687540	5689680	raw and textured glory.
5689680	5692600	And this is, you know, what we had.
5692600	5697340	I was playing this when I was in 10th grade, so, you know, I sucked at it.
5697340	5702380	But at any rate, the original arcade game had three levels with its difficulty.
5702380	5706540	So you had the beginner, which is big, big forest, and then you had the Bay Bridge as
5706540	5711560	the intermediate, and then your expert level was the Acropolis.
5711560	5717000	And then each of them had their own feature, like an amusement park in a big forest or
5717000	5721380	the bridge for Bay Bridge or the hairpin turns on Acropolis.
5721380	5726560	So when you select a car, you've got your transit transmission types, you know, your
5726560	5728160	automatic or your standard.
5728160	5734780	You also have the VR view system that lets you choose four different views for the game.
5735060	5742300	It was used in a lot of other Sega racing games like Daytona, and it even was in the
5742300	5747300	home ports, which we're going to get to in a moment, please.
5747300	5752960	So as for the cabinets, there were a few different cabinet versions there.
5752960	5755800	There was a twin cabinet, which was the standard one.
5755800	5761080	It was effectively two arcade machines built into one cabinet.
5761080	5768160	And these were, you know, pretty, pretty widespread for these.
5768160	5775900	However, there was a, there's zenith picture tubes in the Wells Gardner 25 inch monitors
5775900	5780560	actually ended up having a manufacturing defect that caused them to fail after a few years.
5780560	5787300	So many of those machines were either parted out and they're a lot harder to find today.
5787400	5795160	The twin cabinet sold everywhere else was used the 29 inch 9L monitors.
5795160	5800100	So you won't find those, those older ones that much anymore, but they were the first
5800100	5801100	releases.
5801100	5802100	They were the common ones at first.
5802100	5808460	There's also the deluxe version, which is the VRDX cabinet type, which is a single player
5808460	5815580	machine and has a 16, nine aspect ratio, a Hantrex monitor, which was one of the first
5815580	5822980	uses of widescreen aspect ratio monitors in an arcade game, six airbags.
5822980	5830380	So one on each side, or three on each side that would inflate so that you would be nudged
5830380	5835500	when you're cornering or move the airbag to, you know, pull you back while you're breaking.
5835500	5842980	So it's supposed to give you the, that feeling of motion and resistance.
5842980	5851620	And as for a few other things, it also had a fully adjustable forward and back seat that
5851620	5853340	used the air pressure for it.
5853340	5860100	It also had a force feedback steering that used a two pneumatic cylinders to rotate the
5860100	5863680	steering wheel, which was different than the electric motor and clutch system that were
5863680	5866020	used before.
5866020	5870180	So the steering would feel a little bit more true to life.
5870180	5877740	And Virtual Formula ended up being released in 1993, and it was unveiled at the Sega's
5877740	5884620	second arcade amusement park, Joypolis, and there was a room with 32 machines dedicated
5884620	5885620	to it.
5885620	5894140	So Virtual Formula was a Super DX version of VR, and it put you in a full motion hydraulic
5894140	5899620	Formula One car replica in front of a 50 inch screen.
5899620	5907380	And a lot of these units were converted into their IndyCar simulator, Indy 500 found at
5907380	5910120	Sega Gameworks in the US.
5910120	5914220	And I think that we saw one at, I think there was one at the Gameworks in Seattle when we
5914220	5916220	were there.
5916220	5919760	Yes, there was.
5919760	5926920	And on top of that, I believe that these same overall cabinets I've seen used for Daytona,
5926920	5932660	and it was, yeah, I think it was roughly around that same time.
5932660	5936800	They had similar for Daytona, because it was the first time I saw Daytona at the Sega arcade
5936800	5946640	at, crap, what's that casino called that's Egyptian themed in Las Vegas, Luxor, Luxor,
5946640	5947640	thank you.
5947640	5948640	At Luxor.
5948640	5953480	And that was roughly around the same time I was, I was in high school I think, yeah.
5953480	5954480	I just want to comment.
5954480	5955480	They were all like cars.
5955480	5958160	I just want to comment on the video again real quick, which sorry to the podcast listeners,
5958160	5962480	but we're watching another level, and this is the Bay Bridge level, which is really the
5962480	5963560	Golden Gate.
5963560	5967200	But I'm always fascinated, which obviously the geography is completely wrong, it's just
5967200	5969520	an excuse to put something that looks like the Golden Gate in the game.
5969520	5971400	That doesn't look like Sausalito.
5971400	5976640	But it's, and it's not nearly long enough, but the funny thing is racing games always
5976640	5978920	have a fascination with San Francisco.
5978920	5983080	Like San Francisco like always, and it's because of the hills, it's because of the iconic-ness
5983080	5986480	of the Golden Gate, so it's interesting to see it in this game too, because I feel like
5986480	5987480	every...
5987480	5989480	Have you seen a windmill in San Francisco?
5989480	5990480	A what?
5990480	5991480	A windmill in San Francisco.
5991480	5993160	No, yeah, there's no windmills in San Francisco.
5993160	5999360	So some of this stuff is very random, but it's fine, like you know, again, it's just
5999360	6003600	invoking those sorts of images and making you think of that.
6003600	6004600	Yeah.
6004760	6010400	Going back to all the cabinets for Virtua Racing, they're linkable for up to eight players,
6010400	6015720	so four twin units, or eight DX, UR, or Virtua Formula cabinets can be linked together, and
6015720	6018000	they use fiber optic cables for this.
6018000	6022760	There was also an optional display called the Live Monitor that would sit atop the cabinets
6022760	6028280	and replay action shots of what was happening in the game with kind of like a virtual sportscast
6028280	6032200	with a commentator named Vert McPolygon.
6032800	6033800	Yeah.
6033800	6034800	I know.
6034800	6040560	So anyway, for the home console versions, now I'm gonna be a little bit more verbose
6040560	6046800	about the Sega Mega Drive or Genesis as we had it here in the US.
6046800	6053360	This one was honestly, when this came out, it was big shit, okay?
6053360	6059720	They couldn't do the game because of how complex the Model 1 board was, they think they were
6059720	6066280	gonna be able to do a home console version, but in 1994, they created a cartridge design
6066280	6074480	that used the Sega Virtua processor, which basically is an extra chip that enabled you
6074480	6078360	to play a version like this on the Mega Drive, on the Genesis.
6078360	6080520	It was really expensive.
6080520	6087920	So the games, when they came out, they were 100 bucks, it was 70 pounds in the UK.
6087920	6092080	And for what it did at the time, it was pretty amazing.
6092080	6099280	It rendered 9,000 polygons per second in game, which was much higher than anything the Genesis
6099280	6101800	was capable of at the time otherwise.
6101800	6108840	However, you cannot use this on the Majesco Genesis 3, and it will not work on any Genesis
6108840	6113400	that's equipped with a 32X, for obvious reasons.
6113400	6118760	Now speaking of the 32X, yeah, there was a pretty awesome port, Virtua Racing Deluxe,
6118760	6122760	which is pretty fun, and it was developed directly by Sega AM2.
6122760	6129000	It was published by Sega under Sega Sports, and it performed very closely to the arcade
6129000	6133560	version and had two extra cars, one called Stock and the other prototype, and two new
6133560	6136760	tracks that were called Highland and Sand Park.
6136760	6142240	Now of course, the good version, the one that was at the time the most accurate one that
6142240	6145040	you could get was the Sega Saturn.
6145040	6149800	It was, the working title was Virtua Racing Saturn, it was released in 1995, and it was
6149800	6152480	developed and published by Time Warner.
6152480	6161120	Of course, you could put the CD in and play the game, like the music as long as you skipped
6161120	6163800	the tracks, because it was all red book audio.
6163800	6170200	I've got rips of the audio somewhere, and unlike the other versions, it has a Grand
6170200	6176120	Prix mode, where you're driving a series of cars and tracks to earn your points as
6176120	6177840	you go along.
6177840	6184160	And then there was a remake called Virtua Racing Flatout on PS2, it was released under
6184160	6190360	the Sega Ages 2500 label, it was released in Japan in 2004, and did get an American
6190360	6195420	and European release in 2005 as part of the Sega Classics collection, had three new courses
6195420	6197080	and four new cars.
6197080	6201880	And now, and you know, we're seeing more of these Sega Ages ports now on the Switch,
6201880	6207760	so yes, there is a Virtua Racing for Switch, and it was released on April 24th, 2019 in
6207760	6212080	Japan and elsewhere June 27th, 2019, developed by M2.
6212080	6217120	It is an absolute port of the arcade original, with an increased frame rate of 60 frames
6217120	6220760	per second, and in the 69 aspect ratio.
6220760	6225320	You can play online with up to two players, and up to eight players on a single system.
6225320	6232440	It also has online leaderboards, downloadable replays for the top 50 players on each track,
6232440	6237520	an easier steering option, and the Grand Prix mode that increases the total number of laps
6237520	6241240	to 20, and guess who's back?
6241240	6242240	Vert McPolygon!
6242240	6243240	Yay!
6243240	6247040	He cameos in the replay.
6247040	6248040	Love it.
6248040	6251840	So, it was very well received.
6251840	6259760	It was listed in their 1992 issue in October of Game Machine as their most successful upright
6259760	6266760	arcade unit of the year, and it was also very well accepted, of course, here in the US.
6266760	6271040	The Japanese Gamest Awards, it was nominated for Best Action, Best Direction, Best Graphics,
6271040	6275200	then it lost to Street Fighter II Champion Edition, and then Art of Fighting, and then
6275200	6280080	Zexus, which Zexus and, of course, Street Fighter II have been past classic games.
6280320	6282320	I don't know if I've done Art of Fighting.
6282320	6283320	Maybe.
6283320	6288920	EGM called it a racing masterpiece and said, life-like racing sensations are extremely
6288920	6290880	impressive and exciting.
6290880	6293560	So yeah, it really got good reviews.
6293560	6297760	The home versions got pretty great reviews.
6297760	6305000	GamePro loved the 32X version, and they said, actually, that it addressed the longevity
6305000	6310280	of the Genesis version with adding more stuff and giving it a little bit more replay value.
6310280	6316800	And it was for, in 1994, it was on Mega's list of, it was fourth place on Mega's list
6316800	6321320	for top Mega Drive games of all time.
6321320	6327400	And so, yeah, I'm really surprised I haven't done it before, but, you know, kind of on
6327400	6332080	this AM2 kick, so there you go, Virtua Racing.
6332080	6333080	Classic game of the week.
6333080	6334560	Virtua Racing.
6334560	6339120	One that I think many people in their 30s and maybe even like late 20s probably remember
6339120	6344280	seeing this game in an arcade somewhere and how cool it looked at the time.
6344280	6351720	And yeah, now it's being revisited all over again by us here at OLR.
6351720	6359560	So some comments on the use of San Francisco, oftentimes in racing games, we're talking
6359560	6361000	about that in chat a little bit.
6361000	6366320	Bobby Blackwolf pointed out probably also because many gaming companies are in San Francisco,
6366320	6368720	and I was like, oh yeah, Sega used to be in San Francisco.
6368720	6373000	They used to have that iconic building where 80 and 101 kind of met, and the Golden Gate
6373000	6374000	is 101.
6374000	6376320	I mean, you have to kind of go through the city to get to that part of it, but still
6376320	6379160	like, you know, Sega had that iconic building.
6379160	6380160	It's no longer there.
6380160	6383240	It's the Zynga, or was the Zynga building, I don't even know if they're still in it,
6383240	6384240	but you...
6384240	6385240	I don't think so.
6385240	6386240	I think they're out.
6386240	6390660	Yeah, you couldn't miss that Sega logo when you used to go by there all the time.
6390660	6395160	And then Dark Tetsuya said, oh yeah, that might explain the first crazy taxi.
6395160	6399520	Also a Sega game took heavy inspiration from San Francisco as well.
6399520	6402980	So interesting point that, you know, with all the development that happens in the Bay
6402980	6406900	Area, go with what you know, so to speak, in what you develop.
6406900	6407900	That's kind of interesting.
6407900	6411340	I just always thought it was because of the hills, you know, people wanted to do...
6411340	6414740	Because everybody fantasizes about going 100 miles an hour on those hills, which is something
6414740	6419540	you should never do in a real car, Jesus, like those hills are actually not fun in a
6419540	6420540	car.
6420620	6425020	Without the experience being in a car with me going about 90 doing a spin in San Francisco.
6425020	6432660	The hills in San Francisco are the most overrated part of San Francisco, to be real.
6432660	6436580	They're beautiful, especially when you're looking out from Alcatraz, but...
6436580	6437580	There's a story.
6437580	6441420	DJ Ramis just put three dots in chat, so I'm not sure he wants to see this.
6441420	6442420	It's called an ellipsis.
6442420	6443420	It's still.
6443420	6444420	It's called an ellipsis.
6444420	6449440	Anyway, I wanted to take him to Charger Island.
6449440	6452960	And so I was just about to miss the turn, and this was the Lancer.
6452960	6460040	So I effectively drifted going on that on ramp to Treasure Island.
6460040	6461040	It was pretty fun.
6461040	6462040	Yeah.
6462040	6463040	Good times.
6463040	6466320	I'm glad we lived, and I'm glad I didn't get a ticket.
6466320	6471440	But I'll give you my little San Francisco trick for all those of you guys that ever
6471440	6472760	want to go visit.
6472760	6479120	The easiest way to get around San Francisco, take your car, park it on top of a hill in
6479120	6483480	a neighborhood, because all the parking's free on the street at the top of a hill,
6483480	6486680	because nobody wants to park there and walk up and down a hill.
6486680	6488700	And then take Uber or Lyft wherever you need to go.
6488700	6490680	It's gonna be cheaper than parking.
6490680	6493960	That is my tired and true how I get around San Francisco.
6493960	6500640	Or, I mean, even better than that, even better, get yourself a clipper.
6500640	6505040	Yeah, I was gonna say, find a friend that knows that transit system like the back of
6505040	6506040	his hand.
6506040	6508520	You don't need anyone to do it for you.
6508520	6512560	My iPhone will just tell me what buses to take in San Francisco.
6512560	6514240	I'll still get on the wrong one.
6514240	6516040	I'm bad, though, with the trains.
6516040	6517960	I'm bad with the trains right now.
6517960	6518960	Right.
6518960	6519960	All right.
6519960	6522240	Usually, I get JD to help me.
6522240	6523240	All right.
6523240	6524240	Let's move on.
6524240	6528680	Let's get into some rapid fire news and quickly talk about some other news going on in the
6528680	6529680	industry.
6529680	6530680	Loki.
6530680	6537440	Well, I'm relieved that even though we talked about a game-breaking bug in Paper Mario Origami
6537440	6540400	King that they're already patching it.
6540400	6547520	And so, as of right now, patch 101 is available, and it'll actually fix the issue that they
6547520	6554360	had in the Spring of Rainbows and Shangri-Spa, and along with other issues that were apparently
6554360	6557360	blocking progress in the game as well.
6557360	6558680	So, that's a relief.
6558680	6564360	Now, I can finish my game as soon as I get the console back from everybody in my household.
6564720	6570640	Also, coming to the Switch, Pikmin 3 Deluxe, which was an announcement that happened.
6570640	6573800	Apparently, it's coming October 30th.
6573800	6578680	Can we get a different game instead than Pikmin?
6578680	6583040	I mean, really, can we not get another Pikmin game, please?
6583040	6588360	Yeah, I'm not a big Pikmin person either, but cool for those that are.
6588360	6594000	I know some people were really excited about it, so yay for you.
6594000	6599560	I'm guessing we'll be getting more announcements for more games coming to the Switch later.
6599560	6603560	I think this is definitely a Band-Aid.
6603560	6607080	Yeah, that's it.
6607080	6611040	Alright, then for what I was going to talk about, I have a couple quick stories here.
6611040	6614720	So, Loki kind of spoiled this one already earlier in the show, but that's okay, because
6614720	6617360	we'll talk about it outside of just PlayStation.
6617360	6621880	Braid Anniversary Edition, which Loki brought up earlier, is also coming to the Nintendo
6621880	6622880	Switch.
6622880	6628720	So, this new version of the game is going to have some new mixes and an upgraded soundtrack,
6628720	6629720	if you will.
6629720	6634480	It will have some hand-repainted graphics, some all-new animation, and you can switch
6634480	6636960	back and forth between the old and the new Braid.
6636960	6641920	So, it sounds like the Wonder Boy monster's trap and those types of games where you have
6641920	6644360	the button to switch back and forth, which is always cool.
6644360	6647240	They're also talking about extensive developer commentary.
6647240	6652820	So, maybe we'll find out if the ending is supposed to be deeper than the fact that you
6652820	6653820	were the...
6653820	6657900	I guess I shouldn't spoil it for those that still haven't played it after 12 years, but
6657900	6659900	it's a pretty...
6659900	6662580	It is a game, you know, I don't know.
6662580	6665940	I feel like this game kind of has some mixed things, because I think some people saw that
6665940	6670260	movie and so they...
6670260	6674700	Not everything about the development of the game was portrayed in a positive light, but
6674700	6678620	I know that the critics really loved this game and embraced this game, and it was an
6678620	6679620	interesting twist.
6679620	6680620	I will say that.
6680980	6684460	Even the game mechanics was an interesting twist on the old formulas.
6684460	6689100	And you have to remember this game came out when Xbox Live and the whole digital to you
6689100	6692120	game thing was really starting to take off.
6692120	6695860	So I do think Braid is transformative in many ways for the industry, and it is something
6695860	6698460	that I'm not surprised we're revisiting.
6698460	6699680	It's just kind of a weird time.
6699680	6703820	It's a random time for it, I guess, but okay, whatever.
6703820	6709220	Anyway, Fall Guys, which I think is also going to be a big game in our industry, just wait.
6709220	6713160	They are talking about bringing the game to other platforms.
6713160	6718100	It's an official FAQ on the game's website that talks about, will the game come to Xbox
6718100	6719100	or Switch?
6719100	6722660	To start with, Fall Guys will only be available on PS4 and Steam.
6722660	6725980	We'd love to bring the game to other platforms further down the line.
6725980	6729220	Please let us know on Twitter and Discord which platforms you'd like us to release on
6729220	6730220	next.
6730220	6738700	We'd love to see how much demand there is, which is code, I'm sure, for...
6738700	6741980	If you're already on it, please look forward to it.
6741980	6746060	All right, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
6746060	6747700	Oh, this and that.
6747700	6751340	One of them just makes me laugh my ass off, because I'm working on a novel right now,
6751340	6754340	so I know how much research goes into writing.
6754340	6763500	And this is historical fiction, and there is an author named John Boyne, who's had other
6763500	6768040	controversy about him, wrote a historical fiction novel called A Traveler at the Gates
6768040	6777200	of Wisdom, and he made a boo-boo in referencing a recipe for red dye.
6777200	6781320	And I will read it in all of its glory.
6781320	6782320	I will get to it.
6782320	6785760	The dyes that I used in my dressmaking were composed from various ingredients depending
6785760	6790920	on the color required, but almost all required nightshade, sapphire, key swings, the leaves
6790920	6796960	of the silent princess plant, Octorok eyeballs, swift violet thistle, and hightail lizard.
6796960	6802600	I employ spicy pepper, tail of the red Lizalfos, and four Hylian shrooms.
6802600	6805640	Love it.
6805640	6810760	And now, though, I mean, and the screenshot was pointed on Twitter by a writer named Dana
6810760	6811760	Schwartz.
6811760	6818520	It was actually first posted by somebody else, but they've deactivated their account.
6818520	6821040	But it's just, it's absolutely hilarious.
6821040	6827960	And so the writer himself, so he, he admitted to it, he's like, and this is the quote from
6827960	6832680	his Twitter, hey, Twitter, does anyone know how one would go about dyeing a red dress?
6832680	6834680	Asking for a friend.
6834680	6844000	Now, of course, Boyne has been in in the news before for other faux pas, big ones, the Auschwitz
6844000	6849040	Museum stated his book, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas contained many inaccuracies about
6849040	6852720	the Holocaust and should not be used as teaching about the genocide.
6852720	6858840	And then his novel in 2019, called My Brother's Name is Jessica, has also met with extreme
6858840	6864640	criticism from the trans community for misgendering characters, and that he rejected the word
6864640	6872080	cis as a controversial term, even though it's a fucking accurate word, so get over it.
6872080	6881640	But at any rate, yeah, dude needs to cross reference shit when he's doing research, I
6881640	6884640	swear to God, anyway.
6884640	6888320	I'm working on my first book and I know better, okay?
6888320	6897800	So anywho, we had covered Warner Brothers, the gaming division being up for sale, well,
6897800	6899680	that ain't happening now.
6899680	6907880	So they have released an amendment saying that they are still their own, they remain
6907880	6912880	part of the studio networks group, they are completely still their own entities.
6912880	6919600	So yeah, not happening, at least right now.
6919600	6925200	All right, well, we're gonna go on to world release dates and travel around the world
6925200	6927560	and check out what games are coming out near you soon.
6927560	6931520	However, I do need to sneak in one more news item here because it does relate to the Voice
6931520	6936000	Geeks Network and some of our personalities here at VOG Network.
6936000	6939760	I want to give a shout out to Bobby Blackwolf because it is actually confirmed.
6939760	6943280	And if you've been listening to his show, you've kind of heard about some of this, the
6943280	6948300	process he's gone through to get here, but he will be a part of Summer Games Done Quick
6948300	6949800	as one of the announcers.
6949800	6955000	So he did get, even though he fell in the backup category, it turns out they gave the
6955000	6957600	backup hosts one shift, basically.
6957600	6959920	So you can check out Bobby Blackwolf.
6959920	6962800	He's going to be announcing during Summer Games Done Quick.
6962800	6967840	And if you want to check him out, it's going to be Wednesday, August 19th at about 10 Eastern,
6967840	6968840	7 Pacific.
6968840	6971720	I say about because you never know if the speed runs are going to go short or long or
6971720	6972720	whatever.
6972720	6977240	But the speed run, he's going to be a host for and doing the, not the commentary because
6977240	6980040	the guy on the couch or virtual, it's all virtual, right?
6980040	6982200	But the guy actually doing the speed run does the commentary, but he's going to be reading
6982200	6984220	the donations and all that stuff.
6984220	6989220	That is going to be for Devil May Cry 4 will be the game that he is kind of going to be
6989220	6991980	announcing for.
6991980	6995740	One thing he wanted to stress though, so I will pass this along as well.
6995740	6999380	Summer Games Done Quick is about the charity, Doctors Without Borders.
6999380	7000740	It's about the speed runner.
7000740	7003180	It is not about Bobby Blackwolf or VOG Network.
7003180	7007220	So you're encouraged to go donate and give money and all that good stuff because it is
7007220	7008720	a great charity.
7008720	7013980	But don't go there donating, going, ah, VOG Network, blah, Bobby Blackwolf, I love you,
7013980	7016660	that because he does not want the focus to be on him.
7016660	7018680	And in fact, it might actually kind of have a negative effect.
7018680	7022160	So it's really about the speed runner and charity.
7022160	7025840	So let's focus on those things and let's just be thrilled that we kind of like, you know,
7025840	7029020	we already kind of knew somebody there because I know Jason's been volunteering for a little
7029020	7032420	while and now it's like, now we know somebody that will see like on the stream too.
7032420	7036500	So that's really cool how more and more folks here at VOG Network are getting involved with
7036500	7037500	that.
7037500	7041380	So I will definitely try to check out that stream next Wednesday, so not this coming
7041380	7044260	Wednesday, but next Wednesday, and I think that's really cool.
7044260	7045260	So congrats, Bobby.
7045260	7046260	All right.
7046260	7051100	And congrats to Summer Games Done Quick for still doing a marathon, even in this whole
7051100	7056180	pandemic situation and making the necessary adjustments to the virtual thing to do it.
7056180	7059180	And I still think they're going to raise a lot of money and it's going to be a great
7059180	7062900	thing, especially for an organization that could probably use it right now with a fucking
7062900	7068060	pandemic going on right now, because even though America might have this thing under
7068060	7073580	control by 2021 and some of the other, you know, big nations and so forth, there's going
7073580	7077420	to be a lot of countries on the planet that don't have this COVID thing worked out in
7077420	7079700	2021 yet.
7079700	7084060	And so, you know, an organization like Doctors Without Borders is going to be very instrumental
7084060	7088740	in making sure that COVID doesn't spread in other countries as well.
7088740	7090340	So very cool.
7090340	7091340	All right.
7091340	7092340	Yeah.
7092340	7093420	And that's Joe and I'm out with a good tip.
7093420	7099100	If you want to support Bobby, donate for the host announcer choice of donation incentive.
7099100	7103900	So that's another thing you can do there is let him choose the donation incentive.
7103900	7104900	Okay.
7104900	7105900	That shout out being done.
7105900	7108500	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
7108500	7109500	Loki.
7109500	7111020	All right.
7111020	7116620	So in the U.S., we have a few games coming out, starting off with Hyper Scape on PC,
7116620	7119400	PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7119400	7125240	We have Risk of Rain 2 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7125240	7129880	Caller Across Malice Unlimited on Nintendo Switch.
7129880	7134320	Total War Saga Troy on PC.
7134320	7140880	And then we have EA Sports UFC 4 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7140880	7142600	That's it.
7142600	7145040	All right.
7145040	7147200	I'm slow in bringing up the Japanese releases.
7147200	7150160	Can we go out of order and do the U.K. next, Dark Sakura?
7150160	7151160	Sure.
7151160	7153280	It's only a handful on the 13th.
7153280	7156240	We have UFC 4.
7156240	7158600	We have Deliver Us the Moon.
7158600	7163160	And then there's also Beholder Collector's Edition for Switch.
7163160	7164680	All right.
7164680	7166280	So not too much.
7166280	7167280	Yeah.
7167280	7169200	It's kind of a slower week in Japan as well.
7169200	7173560	So looking at the releases over there on the Nintendo Switch, we have Ancestors Legacy
7173560	7174880	on August 11th.
7174880	7177880	And that is the only release on the Switch.
7177880	7186400	Taking a look at the PlayStation 4, we have EA Sports UFC 4 gets a Japanese release on
7186400	7188120	the 14th.
7188120	7189780	And otherwise, that's it.
7189780	7191880	It's a pretty slow week in Japan as well.
7191880	7194560	So there's your release dates around the world.
7194560	7196480	Our next segment is the mailbag.
7196480	7201880	So every week we invite your emails at participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
7201880	7204360	And we read your emails here on the show.
7204360	7210320	However, my understanding is Dark Sakura, you went to the mailbag and it was empty.
7210320	7211800	It was naked.
7211800	7213000	It was born bare.
7213000	7215300	It was born naked and the rest is drag.
7215300	7217400	So that means drag discussion, right?
7217400	7219000	I started watching We Are Here.
7219000	7220000	Oh yeah?
7220000	7221000	How's that?
7221000	7222000	Yeah.
7222000	7223000	I only got through the first episode.
7223000	7225040	I figured I'm going to not binge it.
7225040	7227560	I'm just going to do like an episode here and there.
7227560	7229680	And oh my gosh, I had some sniffles.
7229680	7233040	It was very beautiful and I love Changela even more.
7233040	7237640	I haven't met Changela a couple of times who's just the sweetest person in person.
7237640	7241160	And I'm really enjoying the show.
7241160	7245840	I didn't watch that, but I did watch Muppets Now on Disney Plus.
7245840	7248160	And you might think, what does that have to do with drag queens?
7248160	7251440	Well, RuPaul's in the first episode, for better or for worse.
7251440	7255360	But also I would say that the original drag queen was Miss Piggy.
7255360	7259560	Yeah, I could go with that.
7259560	7262960	The Miss Piggy parts were the only parts where I was laughing out loud.
7262960	7266200	Because I watched the first episode and there's a Miss Piggy segment, which is great.
7266200	7268500	And I was howling because Miss Piggy is hilarious.
7268500	7272760	But then there was this whole Swedish chef thing where like the joke was old fast.
7272760	7276100	And then the RuPaul thing was the joke was also old fast.
7276100	7280200	So I really hope the other episodes of Muppets Now are better than the first one or have
7280200	7282960	more Miss Piggy, the original drag queen.
7282960	7283960	Yeah.
7283960	7284960	All right.
7284960	7291600	You know, it's funny, I've been also listening to a little bit more historical podcasts and
7291600	7299200	talking followed, actually, if you like 60s and 70s drag personalities, it was actually
7299200	7307120	kind of cool to learn more of the origins of drag and actually performers from the 1700s
7307120	7310080	that Oh, when Lady Bunny started, right?
7310080	7311080	Oh, yeah.
7311080	7312080	No, no.
7312080	7314800	Lady Bunny was well before that.
7314800	7317920	Okay.
7317920	7319960	She was helping people by their sandals.
7319960	7320960	I forgot.
7321400	7322520	The Roman government.
7322520	7324440	She was she was the entertainment on the Mayflower.
7324440	7325440	I forgot.
7325440	7326440	Yeah.
7326440	7327440	Rob.
7327440	7328440	She was the meteor.
7328440	7332840	Anyway, Lady Bunny and Lady Bunny is also really fun to chat with.
7332840	7333840	I'm just going to throw that out there.
7333840	7335840	I love Lady Bunny.
7335840	7339520	And if you are not following Lady Bunny on the Facebooks and Twitters, get ready for
7339520	7341320	a political ride.
7341320	7342720	She is very astute.
7342720	7350240	But at any rate, it's a I've been enjoying all this stuff, really getting a little bit
7350240	7357240	more in the like, I think learning from techniques now on things because I'm, you know, as a
7357240	7360800	sister, I think I can always grow because I mean, that's my drag.
7360800	7363320	So that's it.
7363320	7364320	All right.
7364320	7366680	Well, let's get back to video games.
7366680	7367800	Sorry, Loki.
7367800	7373560	I know you were really enjoying this discussion, but maybe it was thrilling and I paid attention
7373560	7375280	to zero.
7375280	7379680	Maybe you have a video game related story to bring us back.
7380120	7386400	Oh, by the way, participate at orange lounge radio dot com is the place to send us emails.
7386400	7391160	So we can talk a little bit about the about Twitch and how the U.S. Army is coming back
7391160	7392160	to it as well.
7392160	7399840	May I remember we talked about a few weeks ago how they had been kind of blocked from
7399840	7407240	Twitch because of some of the recruiting techniques that they were using, like, for example, posting
7407280	7413280	fake giveaways and contests, pages like that, really, to try to get your contact information
7413280	7416600	to contact you about your recruitment.
7416600	7422880	Plus, they were banning people who were asking questions about different things that weren't
7422880	7432520	necessarily abusive or, you know, for example, they were as certain individuals, I guess
7432520	7438160	they're asking questions about war or whatnot, and they were being banned from that.
7438160	7445480	And since it's a government entity, it's technically illegal for them to be banning folks from
7445480	7449560	being able to speak or comment on different things.
7449560	7454520	So now, of course, we have a comment from the U.S. Army Esports team, which is resisting
7454520	7460760	access for those accounts that previously banned for harassing or degrading behavior.
7460800	7465800	The team is reviewing and clarifying its policies and procedures for the stream and provide
7465800	7469960	all who have been banned the opportunity to participate in the space as long as they can
7469960	7471960	follow the team's guidelines.
7471960	7478040	Here, I'm going to give some free advice to the U.S. Army.
7478040	7479040	You ready?
7479040	7482680	Because I do this with a lot of Twitch channels that have big chat rooms.
7482680	7484040	Just don't read the chat.
7484040	7488280	Now, you might be thinking, Rob, this is the show where every gamer has a voice and you
7488280	7489640	read chat all the time.
7489960	7492680	We don't have 5,000 people watching this stream either.
7492680	7496840	And if we had that many people watching the stream, I would beg and ugly plead somebody
7496840	7498520	to help me screen chat comments.
7498520	7499160	Okay.
7499160	7502680	Also, if you had 5,000 people in chat, you probably can't read the chat.
7502680	7503800	Exactly.
7503800	7504600	Just be emojis.
7504600	7505080	Yeah.
7505080	7508520	So y'all have been very nice and well behaved in the chat room.
7508520	7512680	We've only had like a couple incidents and Bobby Banhammer, Black Wolf and the rest of
7512680	7515400	our mods met it with swift justice, which is great.
7516520	7518680	So y'all know I'm not talking about you.
7518680	7524120	I'm talking about those much larger chat rooms where it's just too much.
7524120	7526040	And it's impossible to read.
7526040	7529000	So I would just encourage the Army, just stop reading chat.
7529000	7531400	Just stop reading chat.
7531960	7534600	If it's gonna hurt your feelings that bad, don't read chat.
7536040	7536540	All right.
7537320	7537820	Anyhow.
7539320	7541480	I guess great that they're back on Twitch.
7541480	7543000	I will not be watching.
7543000	7543500	Okay.
7544440	7545320	I wasn't before.
7545320	7547560	And I just think it's still...
7548520	7553080	Just somebody better be watching to make sure that they're not pulling the same garbage
7553080	7553400	again.
7553400	7556600	Not that there's really going to be any consequences for it, it sounds like.
7556600	7557640	So we'll see.
7558200	7558520	All right.
7559080	7565800	Well, moving on, let's talk about the Nintendo Switch and how it's selling a fucking ton
7565800	7566680	of them, basically.
7567640	7571560	Some new numbers from Nintendo's first quarter of their financial year.
7571560	7578040	So in the three-month window until June 30th, 2020, that'll be what, April 1st to June 30th,
7578040	7583880	2020, they sold 5.68 million Switch consoles in just those three months.
7583880	7588040	No wonder you couldn't find one when house arrest began and this whole pandemic thing
7588040	7588840	going on.
7588840	7593560	This means that lifetime sales are at 61.44 million.
7593560	7599320	To put that in perspective, it is less than a half million behind the NES.
7599960	7606600	The classic 8-bit NES that was in so many households that they now have Lego sets dedicated
7606600	7607160	to.
7607160	7609560	That is how many Switches are out there.
7609560	7610680	So that's a lot.
7611240	7613400	Something else to put in mind.
7613960	7624200	Animal Crossing New Horizons is now up to a lifetime sales figure of 22.4 million units.
7625080	7630840	To put that into perspective, it is the second best-selling game on the Switch, period.
7630840	7632120	You know what number one is?
7632120	7635400	Anyone want to guess that doesn't know the answer already?
7635400	7636520	What's the number one game?
7636520	7637640	Darsaka, any thoughts?
7638600	7639880	I'll give you a hint.
7639880	7641400	It's had more time to sell.
7642520	7643560	Oh, Breath of the Wild.
7644200	7646120	Very good guess, but that's actually like number five.
7647400	7649080	Another good guess, but it's not in there.
7650520	7653000	The top-selling game is Mario Kart.
7653000	7653400	You got it.
7653480	7658280	It's Mario Kart 8, and it's not that much ahead.
7658280	7665560	So it seems almost likely that Animal Crossing will overtake it to become the biggest Nintendo
7665560	7666680	Switch game.
7666680	7669240	And that is huge for this franchise.
7669880	7675640	Animal Crossing is officially bigger than Mario or Zelda.
7676200	7677240	Stu on that for a minute.
7678920	7683160	Not yet, technically, because Mario Kart is still number one, but probably this time in
7683160	7687240	a few months, Animal Crossing is Nintendo's biggest franchise.
7687240	7688200	Something to think about.
7689640	7692360	Again, certainly the pandemic has probably played into that as well.
7693640	7698440	Orangewright says, I'm surprised they haven't made DLC to cash in on Mario Kart 8's deluxe
7698440	7699160	success.
7699160	7703240	Why would they do that when they're hard at work on Mario Kart 9 if the rumors are to
7703240	7706040	be believed or the captain obvious is to be believed?
7706040	7707480	Of course, they're going to make a Mario Kart 9.
7708440	7711080	Yeah, well, they did DLC already.
7711080	7712600	They did two pieces of DLC.
7713320	7718760	The only question really is, what's going to be like the twist in Mario Kart 9?
7718760	7719720	What are they going to do differently?
7719720	7722120	Because Mario Kart 8 will be exactly the same.
7722120	7723480	Just more Mario Kart.
7723480	7724360	Probably.
7724360	7726040	But is that a bad thing?
7726040	7726840	I don't think so.
7726840	7730760	No, maybe they'll have more characters since Animal Crossing is going to be their number
7730760	7732040	one selling franchise.
7732040	7733960	They can have Animal Crossing characters in there.
7734920	7738040	Which is, Isabel was already in the last one, but yes.
7738040	7739880	Well, more Animal Crossing characters.
7739880	7743560	Well, yeah, because the Animal Crossing village was the second DLC pack.
7743560	7745080	The first pack was the Zelda one.
7745080	7746920	The second pack was the Animal Crossing one.
7746920	7748200	So something to think about.
7749960	7755160	So, yeah, Nintendo also teasing at the announcements that Paper Mario the Origami King had just
7755160	7755560	come out.
7756120	7757800	They talked about the Pikmin remaster.
7758360	7762200	So it looks like Nintendo will probably have another really good quarter this quarter as
7762200	7768040	well, especially with this pandemic continuing on and more people are escaping to Animal
7768040	7770920	Crossing, which I never even talked about.
7770920	7773080	I never even talked about Animal Crossing during my gaming week.
7773080	7777560	I'm getting so frustrated that I'm not getting more pictures from villagers.
7777560	7781480	I'm giving every single one of them gifts every damn day.
7781480	7785560	And I still don't have anybody's picture, but catch up, which she's the most important.
7785560	7788600	But still, Rob, what do you want to know what happened?
7788600	7789800	What you want to know who left?
7790840	7791400	Oh, who?
7792440	7793320	Dina.
7793320	7794120	Oh, that's sad.
7795080	7798600	Well, I mean, and I've got a card to give you of her anyway, so you can have her.
7798600	7801160	But but I waited too long to replace her.
7801160	7806040	And now I'm getting Graham, who is this derpy looking little hamster.
7806040	7807480	And Dan is excited about it.
7807480	7809240	But now I need another female character.
7809240	7813000	So Octavian is getting the boot because I have his picture.
7813000	7816600	Yeah, I think I told you, I guess this happened last week.
7816600	7820920	I lost Joey, the duck that never wore pants like Donald Duck.
7820920	7825560	And I got Boots is my newest one, who's like a jock alligator.
7827400	7827720	Yeah.
7827720	7832360	And the funny thing is, his birth, he showed up on my island like August 2nd.
7832360	7833960	His birthday was August 7th.
7835080	7837240	So I was like, am I even going to be able to give him a gift?
7837240	7837720	Am I going to be?
7837720	7839000	But I was able to give him a gift.
7839000	7841560	If you talked to him for two days, then yeah, you can give him a gift.
7841560	7842040	OK, good.
7842040	7842520	Yeah.
7842520	7846520	So I gave him I gave him one of those iron door things.
7846520	7847880	And so he put that out on his house.
7847880	7851720	And I even customized it to green because he's an alligator and he's green.
7851720	7853000	So I thought he'd like that.
7853800	7857240	Well, I'm going to I'm going to probably I don't know.
7857240	7859720	Well, you know who I'm going to replace Octavian with?
7859720	7860280	His Anka.
7861800	7865800	Because I have a card for Anka.
7865800	7869480	So and then I will eventually go back on my hunt for Adi.
7869480	7869880	We'll see.
7870840	7872920	Dark Tetsuya says I'm trying to get Boomer.
7872920	7875480	I just had a spot open up, but I haven't found him yet.
7875480	7876200	Boomer lives.
7876200	7877880	I have Boomer, actually.
7877880	7880120	He's my only now since Joey left.
7880120	7881720	He's my only lazy type.
7881720	7884440	If he ever offers to leave dark Tetsuya, I'll let you know.
7885160	7887000	Although it would have to time up just right.
7887000	7889720	Like he's got to be in boxes the same day you have an empty house.
7889720	7891000	So it doesn't always work out.
7891000	7893400	But I'll let you know if Boomer ever leaves.
7893400	7899560	So I am I am never getting rid of of Zucker, who is my lazy special child.
7899560	7899880	Yeah.
7899880	7901320	Talks to the bugs in his floor.
7901320	7903240	I won't let him turn my gown.
7903240	7904760	Yeah, I won't like ketchup ever leave.
7905560	7909640	Well, Zucker loves his bug, so I gave him a termite now so he can have his bugs 24 seven.
7909640	7910440	That's like Boomer.
7910440	7913160	He's like obsessed with bugs and taking it easy.
7913160	7915400	It's all that you know, it's funny.
7915400	7920040	And Dan and I were saying this that even though these are like set personality types,
7920040	7922200	they have the same dialog, you know, et cetera.
7922840	7927960	It's like looking at their little body types and who they are adds a different
7927960	7929480	air of personality to them.
7930040	7932760	Like we were talking about how Rosie and Apple.
7932760	7937160	OK, Apple's, you know, little squishy hamster, annoying pink thing.
7937160	7938360	And Rosie is a cat.
7938360	7940120	You know, she's one of the classic ones.
7940120	7941000	Everyone knows Rosie.
7942120	7945560	But we were like, Rosie's just like Dan's like, yeah, Rosie's kind of full of herself.
7945560	7947320	And, you know, she's like the idol girl.
7947320	7950840	And while Apple had the same personality, she was so much the wannabe.
7950840	7951340	Yeah.
7951880	7957080	You know, or like with your characters, like we have Dom and he's a jock, you know, sheep.
7957080	7958920	And he's this fluffy little guy.
7958920	7960120	Like where's all this muscles?
7960120	7960920	He's a fluffy guy.
7961720	7963960	So and let me ask this question of D'Artitsio.
7963960	7965160	Why not cube?
7965160	7967400	If you want a penguin cube still in the game, right?
7967400	7971800	He was like, he was the most desirable villager in the original game because it was like cube
7971800	7973400	on the GameCube and it's a penguin.
7973400	7973900	Cool.
7974440	7976040	Although I have a card for cube.
7976040	7979960	I'm not one to criticize choices and villagers like, you know, you like who you like.
7979960	7984040	So but I'm just I'm I would there's people I will judge for.
7985240	7988280	There's ones I will judge for who I want to know.
7988840	7991880	I still want Antonio, though, because Antonio is cool.
7991880	7993080	Antonio's on Allen's Island.
7996920	8002360	But at any rate, there are some that just like really like I'll be honest,
8002360	8004520	that pink gorilla one, what was her name?
8004520	8005400	Oh, Rocket.
8005400	8006280	I liked her.
8006280	8007240	I don't like Rocket.
8009240	8011000	I honestly don't like any of the gorillas.
8011640	8012440	Whatever.
8012440	8013000	All right.
8013000	8014440	We should probably move on to the next story.
8014440	8015080	Sorry, Jamie.
8015800	8019400	We see an Animal Crossing like two hour chat every week.
8020040	8024840	New podcast, Animal Crossing all the time or a special live stream on VOG or something.
8024840	8026200	Animal Crossing all day, every day.
8027400	8028680	Come over to one of our towns.
8028680	8031720	Don't tell me I'll do a random Animal Crossing stream on VOG.
8031720	8033560	I'll do it if you're willing to join me on Discord.
8033560	8033960	Let's do it.
8033960	8034680	Let's do it this week.
8034680	8037320	We'll talk if it's if it's a day that I can.
8037320	8037720	Sure.
8037720	8038520	Yeah, we'll talk.
8038520	8039000	Yeah.
8039000	8040120	OK, no big whoop.
8041160	8041960	No big deal.
8041960	8043320	So is it me?
8043320	8043820	Yep.
8044780	8045340	It's me.
8045900	8046940	What do I get to do?
8048220	8052140	So, you know, I have been saying I like GamerX to come back.
8052140	8055100	I love all the fun, you know, gaming events.
8055100	8057580	G-A-Y-M-I-N-G.
8057580	8062780	Well, there is a British media outlet called Gaming Magazine that has announced it will
8062780	8070940	be holding its first gaming awards ceremony in 2021 that offers recognition to community
8070940	8075740	streamers, games, companies that, quote, offer positive and inclusive support in the
8075740	8078140	representation of LGBTQ community.
8079260	8081020	Don't forget the A. The A is important.
8081020	8081580	I am the A.
8082540	8090300	And anyway, they have a global panel of over 20 judges in the community who will, you know,
8090300	8098700	go through the nominees and go through and offer nominees based on these criteria.
8098700	8104220	So we have the Game of the Year category categories, Game of the Year, Authentic Representation
8104220	8111180	Award, Best LGBTQ Character, Narrative, Indie Game, Streamer, Industry Diversity Award,
8111180	8114380	Special Recognition Award, and Gaming Magazine's Reader Award.
8115100	8117180	So, yeah, stay posted.
8117180	8118220	Keep a lookout for it.
8118220	8122060	And for those in the chat, I'll link the tweet to it.
8122700	8126460	So if anyone wants to follow this, there you go.
8126460	8128620	But look up Gaming Magazine.
8129740	8132220	Their handle is at GamingMag.
8132220	8134220	G-A-Y-M-I-N-G-M-A-G.
8135900	8136400	All right.
8137020	8137260	Yeah.
8137260	8143180	I mean, obviously, as a gay guy who plays video games, I'm excited to see something
8143180	8143900	like this.
8143900	8146380	It does kind of seem like it kind of came out of the blue.
8146380	8149740	Like this magazine just decided, hey, let's throw this event.
8149740	8151420	And maybe people will show up.
8151420	8153500	But I guess that's how all good ideas start, right?
8154940	8155820	I think it's a good thing.
8155820	8157100	We definitely need more of it.
8157100	8157600	Yeah.
8158380	8159180	We'll see what happens.
8160140	8161420	I'll check it out online.
8161420	8166140	I mean, I ain't gonna be able to fly to London, not in February 2021, and check it out in
8166140	8166540	person.
8166540	8169020	But I'll probably still be banned from the UK then.
8169020	8170780	But I'll definitely check it out online.
8170780	8172060	So there's that.
8173020	8173580	All right.
8173580	8177260	A few more stories for you guys before we get to taking your questions in the listener
8177260	8178860	roundtable in our chat room.
8178860	8179660	Loki, what do you have?
8180460	8180960	All right.
8181520	8190400	So the World of Warcraft is getting a tribute for one of the Twitch streamers, Reckful.
8191040	8194800	So they're going to be honoring him.
8194800	8197920	He died apparently last month from suicide.
8197920	8198240	Yeah.
8198240	8205520	And so with that, they're going to give him a MPC that's going to be located in the Cathedral
8205520	8207120	of Light in the Shadowlands.
8207920	8208960	So that's pretty cool.
8208960	8212160	I like how they do these kind of tributes and stuff for these players.
8213520	8216000	So yeah, it's nice.
8216000	8224720	And then apparently if there's, I guess you can, you know, I guess say hi to it and stuff.
8224720	8231840	And then basically he'll say, I don't train assassin or assassination rogues.
8231840	8238160	I guess it's a reference to his time in the top of the PvP ladder, it says.
8238160	8239440	So interesting.
8239440	8243920	Yeah, he was trying to prove a point that because assassination was like the big thing
8243920	8246080	at the time, it was like one of the strongest builds.
8246080	8249040	He was proving that you could do PvP without the assassination build.
8249760	8252640	And I think something that was important to remember about Reckful, though, I mean, I
8252640	8257440	can't claim to have watched his streams all the time, but my understanding is he was not
8257440	8261680	just a popular and large World of Warcraft streamer on Twitch.
8261680	8264480	He was an early World of Warcraft streamer on Twitch.
8264480	8269040	So one might even argue, like, you know, helped to shape the streaming community on
8269040	8270480	Twitch to what it is today.
8271360	8275440	So I'm sure there's lots of players who are very happy to hear this and pay tribute.
8275440	8280800	And yeah, you've mentioned sometimes folks who have left us in the real world do get
8280800	8283280	some sort of memorialization of World of Warcraft.
8283280	8284800	I can think of another one off the top of my head.
8284800	8289440	I know in a Horde house back in the day when I still had that side podcast about World
8289440	8295440	of Warcraft, we talked to somebody whose husband had been memorialized in the Wrath
8295440	8296320	of Pandaria.
8297440	8301440	No, and there was Mists of Pandaria in the Mists of Pandaria expansion.
8301440	8304560	So there was also, like, was it like the Dwarven statue?
8304560	8305920	Yeah, there were a few developers.
8305920	8307840	There was the Dwarven statue.
8307840	8311760	And then there's, you know, people still with us, you know, that have been turned into it
8311760	8315200	like Leroy Jenkins is an achievement that I don't think you can get anymore.
8316400	8317360	But I got it.
8318160	8324080	But, you know, there's so I really that's one thing that I've always given them, even
8324080	8330240	if I'm not going to be playing anymore, how they've at least had this bond with the
8330240	8331040	community.
8331040	8335680	Or as Act Dev says in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, Act Dev says shows us again
8335680	8338320	that the actual devs at Blizzard do give a crap.
8338320	8341440	So, you know, despite all those other things we were talking about, you know, early in
8341440	8345920	the show, which again, that has to do with mismanagement and people at the higher level
8345920	8349760	and the Bobby Kotex who are money hungry and all this stuff and and the people that
8349760	8354640	are actually in there doing the work on the front lines like are very kind and, you know,
8354640	8357360	we'll do these types of things for important community members.
8357360	8358400	I think it's really cool.
8358400	8362320	Like I, you know, again, I don't like to talk about my own mortality, but I think I've
8362320	8364800	even said this, like just a couple weeks ago on the show.
8365440	8367760	If anything, heaven forbid should ever happen to me.
8367760	8374800	I would I would be so hopeful I would be memorialized as a pokestop or something in these games,
8374800	8378080	you know, some of the games that I've loved over the years.
8378080	8381600	Final Fantasy 14 would be amazing or Warcraft.
8381600	8385200	I loved Warcraft for many years, you know, so anyhow.
8386320	8386640	All right.
8386640	8395120	Well, moving on to a game that is very old, but in many ways hasn't aged and has really
8395120	8404240	shown us many other types of first person shooters since Quake and Quake Con 2020 happened
8404240	8406080	this weekend, although, of course, it was all online.
8406080	8407440	It was a virtual convention.
8407440	8413600	But part of the virtual convention was that you can get the original Quake for free and
8413600	8416640	it's something that you can actually play on a newer PC.
8416640	8418800	It has to be done through the Bethesda launcher.
8418800	8422320	So ain't nothing really free in this world because you got to put that on your computer.
8422960	8427600	But it is I actually checked it out myself and downloaded it because I had the Bethesda
8427600	8428800	launcher anyway for something else.
8429520	8432800	So, yeah, it's it's cool to get to play the OG Quake again.
8432800	8435200	I don't know how mod support works or any of that stuff.
8435200	8440160	I don't know if it's easy to put in Team Fortress or whatever, but I know it's there.
8440800	8447760	And they are saying Quake 2 is supposed to be following very soon now.
8447760	8449280	And Quake 3 also.
8449280	8451280	Oh, Quake 3 is the best one.
8451280	8451760	I hope so.
8451760	8456400	Quake 3 is also supposed to be free as well after apparently it says we'll be free in
8456400	8461360	Bethesda net launcher after Quake Con if you logged in during Quake Con.
8461360	8462640	Now, it's not.
8462640	8467520	Yeah, I was just gonna say, because no one special in chat says I just looked at Bethesda's
8467520	8470800	launcher store and Quake is a dollar fifty, not free.
8470800	8474160	So it might have just run out by the time we were on air.
8474160	8477680	So sorry, I guess I should say Quake was free this weekend.
8477680	8478400	Womp, womp.
8478400	8482720	But do keep a lookout for Quake 2 and 3 because, again, I didn't care for Quake 2 as much,
8482720	8484720	but Quake 3 I thought was a really strong game.
8486480	8489760	Yeah, and that'll still be through the launcher as well, of course.
8490480	8491280	Nice.
8491280	8493520	Oh, yeah, they got their $10,000 donations.
8493520	8494000	That's cool.
8494000	8494500	Great.
8495120	8495680	All right.
8495680	8498800	Well, that is it for the topics that we had planned out tonight.
8498800	8502080	But if you have something you want to bring up, you can do that in our chat room over
8502080	8504080	twitch.tv slash vog network.
8504080	8507040	Maybe there's something we haven't discussed tonight or you want to get our opinion on
8507040	8508160	that we haven't talked about yet.
8508720	8511600	In the meantime, I will turn to Loki and see if there's any last minute stories.
8512800	8517280	No, because you took my one in the very beginning about the controllers leaking.
8517280	8517920	Oh, my bad.
8518640	8521920	Aside from that, there is absolutely nothing else to talk about.
8522480	8524880	Yeah, I have to be honest.
8524880	8527680	I had to really dig to fill out the show tonight.
8527680	8528800	I think we had a bunch of...
8528800	8531600	They were all good stories, but it was just enough.
8534000	8537520	But if we're wrong, if you guys have an additional thing you want to talk about, please, by all
8537520	8538640	means, speak up and chat.
8538640	8541280	We do have a chat from no one special in our chat.
8541280	8542640	It says round table question.
8543200	8544800	Okay, so most of us...
8544800	8547280	And by the way, for the podcast listeners who aren't here live,
8547280	8550960	the name in chat really is no one special 77.
8550960	8554080	I'm not being like, oh, they're nobody special.
8554080	8556160	That's actually their nickname, just so we're clear.
8556160	8557760	I'm not a total asshole, just partial.
8558400	8560320	No one special asks round table question.
8560320	8566000	Okay, so most of us, if not all of us, love retro games and retro collections, and they're
8566000	8568160	semi-popular on services like Steam.
8568880	8575200	That being said, if you could have any game from the 1990s re-released for Steam, what
8575200	8576880	would it be and why?
8577600	8583040	Ooh, see, now it's the 90s, so I can't go to my go-to guardian legend answer from 1988
8583040	8584880	or 87, whenever that was out.
8584880	8586560	So what do we do from the 90s, gang?
8587120	8589360	What game would you like to see re-released from Steam?
8593360	8594320	Virtua racing.
8597920	8599040	When did Rival Schools come out?
8599040	8607360	Um, I might say, you know, uh, and I talk about this game frequently as an old favorite
8607360	8608640	on the 1997.
8608640	8609200	It counts.
8609200	8609600	Okay.
8610480	8613760	On the NES and Super Nintendo, there was a series.
8613760	8618480	There was a, it was a Solstice on the NES and it was Equinox on the Super Nintendo.
8618480	8620000	And I think a lot of people knew Solstice.
8620000	8625520	I don't think hardly anybody knew Equinox, but it was that rare Sony Imagine Soft game
8625520	8628400	on the Super Nintendo, because this is before Sony had their own thing.
8629280	8630800	And I loved Equinox.
8630800	8631680	I love the music.
8631680	8633680	I love the type of game it was.
8633680	8637840	And there's games that I guess that are kind of like it, but I would love to have like
8637840	8645680	an official release of those type of games, uh, kind of come back on, um, um, Steam.
8646400	8651760	Um, or I guess if I could, if you wanted to go way back to PC stuff, I mean, think about
8651760	8655120	some of the games I've talked about as classic game of the week previously on the show.
8655120	8658960	And you probably got to go way back, but there was a game I used to love to play in
8658960	8662000	the nineties, uh, that was over a modem.
8662000	8663680	It was called Lexi Cross.
8663680	8667280	And I know I've done this as a classic game of the week, but it was like a game show that
8667280	8668560	was like a word puzzle.
8668560	8672400	It was like a wheel of fortune mixed with like a crossword puzzle type of thing.
8672400	8676240	Uh, and you could play over the modem and actually play against somebody else.
8676240	8677840	I thought that game was tons of fun.
8677840	8678640	So I love that.
8679520	8684160	So, um, I would say, uh, point blank.
8685440	8687200	Oh, that's a good one.
8687920	8694960	You know, our buddy Y Y R released a really good point blank inspired game called sharpshooter
8694960	8696240	available on Steam.
8696240	8697280	Cheap plug, cheap plug.
8698160	8698800	So there's that.
8699840	8700160	Yeah.
8700160	8703600	I see that there was a point blank DS game, which I completely forgot about.
8703600	8705120	I forgot about that too.
8705120	8710160	Um, a thing, but yeah, I would like to see a new point blank would be pretty cool.
8710160	8710960	Yeah.
8710960	8715520	Uh, let's see pixel pockets and chat says freelance writers for the popular visual novel
8715520	8716080	collection.
8716080	8720480	Love struck one, a significant pay increase from their publisher voltage.
8720480	8725200	They had a strike for 21 days because they were being paid under market rates.
8725200	8729840	See what I tell you earlier in the show, this is, this is the beginning, like this bubble
8729840	8735120	on the whole, like unions and, and folks that, you know, again, and I, as I said earlier
8735120	8738560	in the show, folks that are taken advantage of because.
8740240	8744640	Higher ups know that there's so many people that are enthusiastic and wanting to get into
8744640	8745440	the industry.
8745440	8750160	Like the bubble's going to burst on that very soon because honestly you have so many people
8750160	8753600	now that are just like, you know what, if this is the way I'm going to get treated,
8753600	8754000	fuck it.
8754000	8755120	I'm going to make an indie game.
8755120	8756960	I'm going to make my own game studio.
8756960	8762640	I'm going to make the next fall guys and be, you know, a huge, successful success.
8763440	8768160	So apparently doing a quick Google search for point blank, apparently gun bullet X is
8768160	8773440	a thing, which is a brand new point blank game that came out in 2017 arcades and it's
8773440	8774560	all in HD and stuff.
8774560	8777280	So I guess we already got that.
8777280	8781200	I'd still like it on steam, but you know, at least it's a thing.
8782400	8786880	Dr. Tzuyu in chat says it's not nineties, but I wish Capcom would release their early
8786880	8789520	eighties arcade stuff on steam and switch.
8789520	8792960	They had a pretty decent arcade collection on the PlayStation three.
8792960	8794320	It was in like five parts.
8795200	8799520	And I don't know why they haven't gone back to that because, you know, Sega goes back
8799520	8800400	to that.
8800400	8805360	Every generation there's some fucking Genesis collection that'll come out, you know, that
8805360	8806640	was something new or whatever.
8807440	8810720	And some of the, like the Sega ages stuff is pretty great.
8810720	8813680	I wish they would compile all of those on a one disc and release that.
8814320	8816800	And speaking of Capcom, how about Powerstone?
8816800	8818400	Can we get some more Powerstone please?
8818400	8818800	Yes.
8818800	8819520	Good call.
8819520	8820720	Powerstone.
8820720	8822240	I'm all for that on the switch.
8822240	8823440	Let's bring that back.
8823440	8823920	Yep.
8823920	8825440	I think that's one we can all agree on.
8825440	8826960	So that's the answer to your question.
8826960	8832320	Now with Capcom and Eidos, can we get, you know, Capcom's not willing to get Eidos to
8832320	8832880	do it.
8832880	8833120	All right.
8833120	8834240	There's the official answer.
8834240	8836960	There's the official OLR approved answer to your question.
8836960	8837760	No one special.
8837760	8839200	The game we want to see is Powerstone.
8841040	8841680	All right.
8841680	8841920	Yeah.
8841920	8845440	Orange Wright says that's one of the few reasons I turn on my Vita is Powerstone collection.
8846080	8846880	Yes, that's true.
8846880	8847600	They have that there.
8848320	8849440	There's on the via TV.
8850160	8855200	I really, I really wish PlayStation five would do something with my Vita library.
8855200	8860480	I know it's asking for a lot, but man, I would be so happy if I could just like play my digital
8860480	8862800	Vita purchase games on my PlayStation five.
8862800	8865040	Like I know, I know I'm reaching.
8865040	8868320	I know it's a big ask, but how awesome would that be?
8870560	8873840	They should be able to emulate it with the power of the PlayStation five.
8873840	8874640	I mean, come on.
8875680	8880320	I get angry when I think, because like the best version of Final Fantasy four is on the
8880480	8883040	Vita or actually was on the PSP, but also Vita.
8884000	8888960	And then Powerstone collection and luminous and active says, I want Tyco.
8890400	8891600	Like, yeah, my God.
8893280	8894080	That's what I want.
8894080	8895360	Sony help.
8895360	8895860	All right.
8897040	8899600	That's going to do it for another episode of orange lounge radio.
8899600	8903200	Then we're going to start to wrap things up here by getting everybody's final thoughts.
8903200	8905840	But first I want to thank you guys for tuning into our show tonight.
8906560	8909840	So of course we do tape live Sunday nights at the voice geeks network,
8909920	8912080	starting at about six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern.
8912720	8915920	And if, uh, you know, we don't ask for your money or anything like that.
8915920	8919200	We were, we appreciate the bits and love the followers and all that.
8919200	8921040	And I really, really appreciate all that stuff.
8921040	8924560	And so I want to say thank you for that, but you know what really, really helps the show
8924560	8925520	is word of mouth.
8925520	8928560	So if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio, tell a friend or two about the
8928560	8931120	show, um, that word of mouth goes an awful long way.
8931120	8934640	The hosting is awesome too on Twitch, if you're willing to do that.
8934640	8938880	But even if you just show up every week, we're happy to have you and, uh, really appreciate
8938880	8939600	that as well.
8940160	8944560	A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Google play, wherever it is.
8944560	8947920	Although I heard podcasting is going away and Google play and moving somewhere else.
8947920	8951920	So wherever it is you found this show, uh, appreciate that type of word of mouth too.
8952480	8953040	Uh, all right.
8953040	8956000	With that, let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.
8956000	8957600	So Loki, we'll start with you tonight.
8957600	8958240	Your final thought.
8958880	8962000	I'm hopefully going to build some more Legos on stream.
8962000	8965520	Um, I don't know at some point we'll get around to it, I guess.
8966080	8967760	Um, I'd like to do that.
8968960	8972880	Uh, my final thought is definitely want to play no man's sky this week.
8972880	8976800	I'm, I'm feeling invigorated having helped delve in out through those first few stages
8976800	8978800	and someday we'll play multiplayer.
8978800	8982960	Uh, I've got a stream animal crossing this week now with dark soccer, cause I'm really
8982960	8984160	into this idea.
8984160	8988240	And, uh, and only one other person sent me their code for a dream Island, but we'll go
8988240	8989840	visit it if nothing else.
8989840	8994560	And, uh, number three, there's a final fantasy 14 patch finally after a long wait this week.
8994560	8996720	And I'm very, very excited to play that as well.
8996800	8999920	Cause it's the conclusion to this latest expansion story.
8999920	9001760	So I'm really excited to explore that.
9001760	9008000	And they are finally taking the chop to the realm reborn content.
9008000	9012480	So if you thought your biggest problem with fantasy 14 was it takes too fucking long to
9012480	9013920	get through realm reborn.
9013920	9014400	Good news.
9014400	9016240	They're cutting it way down this next expansion.
9016240	9017200	That's a great thing.
9017200	9018160	Or I'm sorry, this next patch.
9018160	9019040	That's a great thing.
9019040	9021200	Uh, last but not least dark soccer, your final thought.
9022080	9026800	So I decided to go ahead and look up the character, um, uh, stuff for shadow lands.
9027440	9030080	And one of the undead literally has the Elvira hair.
9032240	9033360	That's awesome.
9033360	9034240	It's the best thing.
9034240	9034800	Yeah.
9034800	9039280	Um, but no, another thing is just make sure everybody makes sure you are registered to
9039280	9039840	vote.
9039840	9044560	Make sure you get everything that you need to vote by mail and then vote accordingly.
9045760	9048880	Or be prepared to drop off your ballot in person.
9048880	9049120	Yeah.
9049120	9051760	And vote early because, you know, mail will be slow.
9052480	9053280	Exactly.
9053280	9055760	Do do the thing, make change happen.
9055760	9055920	Yeah.
9056800	9060320	I would really think as long as you're, you know, if you're immunocompromised, this still
9060320	9063600	might be a risk for you, but if you're willing to like put on a mask and just generally stay
9063600	9069040	away from people, drop off your ballot in person, that's the best way to do it.
9069040	9072240	I'm going to spend every episode, like the end of drag race.
9075200	9077360	Are you going to dance around with the sign that says registered to vote?
9077360	9078720	No, I'm not going to do that.
9078880	9079200	Okay.
9080240	9080480	All right.
9080480	9082480	I'm also sending you the old my right here.
9082480	9083200	All right.
9083200	9087680	That is going to do it for my first hands-free episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
9088320	9092400	Thank you so much for listening to the show tonight and checking out our show.
9093280	9097520	We will be back again to do it all in seven days or another week and who knows what type
9097520	9097760	of news.
9097760	9100080	Maybe we'll get another surprise Nintendo announcement.
9100080	9101680	We can dream, right?
9101680	9102480	We'll see.
9102480	9103920	Until then, have a great week, everybody.
9106560	9108640	No, all you have to do is climb that hill.
9109280	9110720	And make a deal with God.
9110720	9111200	All right.
9111200	9111760	That's it.
9111760	9112320	We're out of here.
9112320	9113440	That's running up that hill.
9113440	9113680	Okay.
9114240	9114740	Bye.
