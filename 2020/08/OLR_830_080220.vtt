00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
I've asked before what future generations of consoles are going to bring. 3D? Dead.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.300
Motion control? Stable but dwindling. 8K? Inevitably expected. So what's left? A game

00:18.300 --> 00:21.880
preview has purportedly leaked a deeper game integration via the console dashboard, like

00:21.880 --> 00:25.560
jumping straight into time trials on a racing game, online battle or story mode for shooters

00:25.560 --> 00:29.520
and so on, all happening at the console menu which should save time for everyone. This

00:29.520 --> 00:33.200
is just my opinion. Plenty more still to come from your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers

00:33.200 --> 00:36.820
and Loki on this and all the news of the week starting right now on the show where every

00:36.820 --> 00:38.760
gamer has a voice.

00:38.760 --> 00:46.640
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

00:46.640 --> 00:53.460
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Back live again tonight with episode

00:53.460 --> 01:00.020
number 830 for this August the 2nd of 2020. I can't believe it's August already at the

01:00.020 --> 01:05.340
same time this year has been quite a wash, hasn't it? My name is Rob Roberts and I'm

01:05.340 --> 01:10.660
joining you with my friends that I met playing Dance Dance Revolution about 20 years ago

01:10.660 --> 01:14.700
at the local arcade. And at some point we decided, hey, you know, we should start a

01:14.700 --> 01:18.760
podcast or we should at that time podcasting didn't quite start yet. So it was like we

01:18.760 --> 01:23.140
should do a live internet show about DDR and music games because we love them so much.

01:23.140 --> 01:26.100
And then after a couple of years, it was like, why are we limiting ourselves to music

01:26.100 --> 01:32.160
games? Let's talk about all video games, classics, new stuff, just celebrating gaming and gaming

01:32.160 --> 01:38.740
culture. And one of my co-hosts is Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers. Hello.

01:38.740 --> 01:48.060
Oh, hi. How are you? I am. I'm okay. Good. You're looking looking fabulous as always.

01:48.060 --> 01:54.780
Thanks. I just pulled this one out for today. I'm pleased with it. That got an immediate

01:54.780 --> 02:03.340
immediate. Yes. New wig in our chat from VGRealness. So I may be I may be digging out some others

02:03.340 --> 02:07.780
like at this point, I'm actually thinking about investing in more mannequins. You know,

02:07.780 --> 02:12.340
the wig mannequins right now, though, I have that black one I wore last week because right

02:12.340 --> 02:16.900
now it's probably my favorite, like as a daily wear. And I thought it looked really good.

02:16.940 --> 02:23.780
I showed it to my physical therapist and she's like, that's not you. That's you. So and everyone's

02:23.780 --> 02:27.300
like, you should dye your hair black. You should do black. So what I'm going to do is

02:27.300 --> 02:32.100
next dye I do, it's going to go black, but I'm going to have one that's black with red

02:32.100 --> 02:38.980
tips. Just a streak. Okay. A little streak of fire going there. Okay. I like it. I mean,

02:38.980 --> 02:46.180
I haven't worn I haven't had my hair black since the 90s. Well, whether you come here

02:46.180 --> 02:50.340
for the video game discussion or you come here for the wigs, you can join us live at

02:52.260 --> 02:57.220
twitch.tv slash vog network, the voice geeks network, where we do tape live every Sunday

02:57.220 --> 03:01.620
night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

03:02.340 --> 03:06.020
Please say hello to our other friend that we met playing Dance Dance Revolution.

03:07.140 --> 03:13.540
It's tech master Loki. Hello. Hi, Loki. How are you? I'm fine. All right. Now our chatters are

03:13.620 --> 03:17.940
taunting you tonight about this game that you're running in the background. And again,

03:17.940 --> 03:21.380
I apologize because I know it's a podcast too. And you guys can't see the visuals.

03:22.020 --> 03:27.540
But I will explain. It looks like Loki is playing footage of his game. He never finished

03:27.540 --> 03:33.940
behind him tonight. Is this your game? It is exactly that. Yeah, it's it's it was footage

03:33.940 --> 03:39.620
of the last level that made in its time the car, which unfortunately, I lost that build of the

03:39.620 --> 03:43.380
game. And it's very disappointing because I wanted to go back in at some point and finish it. But

03:43.540 --> 03:49.140
I don't have any recent builds of it. The I don't know what happened to it because I used to back

03:49.140 --> 03:54.820
that up every few days. And for some reason, I only have up to a certain point. I know I was

03:54.820 --> 04:00.660
having corruption issues with that. That was back in Unity 4. I mean, that's really old.

04:00.660 --> 04:08.100
I'm sorry, but is that is that a cat cannon? It is a cannon that does fire cats. They're not

04:08.100 --> 04:11.700
real cats or robotic cats. As you can see, they're flying off in the space.

04:11.780 --> 04:16.020
Would never want to hurt a real cat. No cats are harmed. But you know, it's just a weird

04:16.660 --> 04:22.100
like that was the things like the game had like a lot of weird levels. And whereas I thought this

04:22.100 --> 04:27.380
would be funny just shooting cats to deliver them to these houses, either hitting the window or the

04:27.380 --> 04:34.420
door. It ended up not being as fun. I have better ways to implement that now. But at the time is

04:34.420 --> 04:38.420
like it sounded like it'd be a cool idea. And it took forever to get the little movement for the

04:38.500 --> 04:43.220
cat because it kind of hops around the ground and it can actually pop up walls as well. And

04:44.500 --> 04:48.180
I spent days trying to get that to work. But yeah, unfortunately,

04:50.420 --> 04:57.380
unfortunately, it's lost to time. Your game is in such early stages. You know,

04:57.380 --> 05:00.740
obviously, if this had been a finished product, you would have probably worked on a lot of the

05:00.740 --> 05:05.940
textures and stuff. But in the current state that we see in the video, it's serving some like early

05:05.940 --> 05:11.300
or late 90s virtual reality simulator realness. I love it. No, it was supposed to be like that

05:11.300 --> 05:16.020
was very like low poly. Okay. You know, it's supposed to be that way. Because that was just

05:16.740 --> 05:21.780
I couldn't draw at all. So that hey, like I even like the cat model, like everything is supposed

05:21.780 --> 05:26.260
to like fit together with that. But yeah, if I was to do it again, I'd do it differently. But

05:26.260 --> 05:32.580
like I was just installed to go on it because I had planned on partaking in a game jam this weekend

05:32.580 --> 05:37.940
and just didn't work out circumstances. Had my son's 10th birthday party yesterday.

05:38.900 --> 05:47.060
Wow. 10. Oh my gosh. Yeah. And then I've just had like a terrible headache for the last, you know,

05:47.060 --> 05:54.020
36 hours. So just that. And then, of course, the theme, I just can't think of anything that I'd

05:54.020 --> 05:58.260
want to do with the theme that sounds like fun. So I'm just going to I'm taking the next three

05:58.260 --> 06:04.260
days off anyways. So I may either go back to working on my game, which is probably what I'm

06:04.260 --> 06:10.420
going to end up doing, or kind of want to go back to work on this game. It would be cool. But

06:10.420 --> 06:18.020
whatever you do, whatever you decide to do, good luck. I play around at least. Yeah. Looking in

06:18.020 --> 06:24.020
our chat room, Dark Tetsuya in chat over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network says, Yeah, I think that's

06:24.020 --> 06:29.620
my main hurdle in game design is doing like sprite art. Well, you know, and I imagine that's why

06:29.620 --> 06:34.980
there's a lot of games that decide to do a retro look and feel is because, well, I don't want to

06:34.980 --> 06:40.340
say retro graphics is easier. That would be very insulting to people that have worked very hard on

06:40.340 --> 06:47.060
sprites. And it can be very difficult in a limited space to design certain looks and certain feels.

06:47.060 --> 06:52.420
So but certainly people might have a preference for one type of art design versus another.

06:52.420 --> 06:57.300
But at the same time, you know, and Bobby kind of jumps in there saying, crazy idea, join a team

06:57.300 --> 07:02.900
with other people and help them on their game. And, and I would if if I knew I could dedicate

07:02.900 --> 07:07.300
a certain amount of time to it, but I don't know with just family and Loki doesn't want other

07:07.300 --> 07:13.380
people to have to rely on him. Exactly. Yeah, I get it. But I was gonna say, you know, also,

07:13.380 --> 07:16.900
there's any own Bobby's talking a little bit about this in chat, but I was gonna say,

07:16.900 --> 07:21.300
you know, sometimes there's art packages and art assets and art things out there, you know, and

07:21.300 --> 07:26.180
this is more in response to what Darcy is saying doing sprite art. Well, a game that Loki and I

07:26.180 --> 07:33.220
haven't shut up about on this show for like four months is Orna. And that game, it uses a very kind

07:33.220 --> 07:39.060
of common sprite pack asset thing, because we've seen the characters in other games, which is kind

07:39.060 --> 07:44.180
of funny, but it doesn't matter because a good game is a good game. And so, you know, and Orna

07:44.180 --> 07:47.620
is a lot of fun. That's why we keep playing it. And plus, it's more impressive when you consider

07:47.620 --> 07:54.580
one guy did it, and he's creating a type of Pokemon Go-esque meets Dragon Warrior type of game.

07:54.580 --> 07:57.700
And I hate calling it Pokemon Go, because really the only thing they have in common is that they

07:57.700 --> 08:03.460
both use your GPS. But it's just impressive that it's done by one dude. Yeah, and I just need to

08:03.460 --> 08:08.100
do more. It's more practice. Like even when I was working on this stuff, like I was really rough,

08:08.660 --> 08:13.620
I'm still rough on everything, you know, so, but I know a lot more now than I did back then was

08:13.620 --> 08:18.740
doing it. And a lot of it was like I was focused on the artwork and everything first, and I really

08:18.740 --> 08:24.180
needed to nail down the gameplay. And even like, you know, playing this, you know, I now have like

08:24.180 --> 08:30.100
better ideas of how I implement things differently that would make it look more fun. But like even

08:30.100 --> 08:35.220
small things, like getting the cat thing, the worker, the confetti cannons, that was fun. Just

08:35.220 --> 08:39.620
like lots of like silly things. And then the problem was, I kind of lost sight of what the

08:39.620 --> 08:45.860
game was because it's like, I don't know. Yeah, I get it. I don't know. It was neat for what it's

08:45.860 --> 08:52.980
all to play some of the other levels later. I'll switch up the video. But yeah, it was fun. Like

08:52.980 --> 08:57.540
it was a fun learning experience. I need to finish something though. Let me read a few more comments

08:57.540 --> 09:01.060
in chat and then we'll get into our kickoff topic tonight, which Loki, I'll have you cover here at

09:01.060 --> 09:06.340
the top for us. But some of the things in chat, Phoenix talking, Phoenix7726 talking about the

09:06.340 --> 09:11.540
retro and so forth saying, retro graphics do tend to have a lower ceiling for designs which look

09:11.540 --> 09:17.220
good enough though. Bobby Blackwolf pointing out that that recent Black Lives Matter bundle that

09:17.220 --> 09:21.460
was on itch.io that I know a ton of you picked up because that bundle made a lot of money for a

09:21.460 --> 09:25.380
great cause. There's a lot of, there's several, I shouldn't say a lot, but there's several asset

09:25.380 --> 09:30.500
bundles in it. And that's, you know, there's, there's all types of, not just art, but I think

09:30.500 --> 09:35.700
there was some music in there too. So some of you guys may have some of that content and not even

09:35.700 --> 09:43.140
realize it. So definitely leverage that from your donation to that. Yeah, let's see. And there's

09:43.140 --> 09:49.540
like some jams actually coming up that I know Kenny, he does a lot of these. He's like, he's

09:49.540 --> 09:56.900
know his asset Jesus out there. He does a lot of those CC0 apps, art assets. I actually contribute

09:56.900 --> 10:02.340
to his Patreon and stuff. And so he's doing a jam with his art assets because he releases like

10:02.340 --> 10:06.660
thousands and thousands of thousands of assets for free. They're almost kind of similar style

10:06.660 --> 10:12.820
as this. This was a different artist that did these though. And so his stuff though, he's got

10:12.820 --> 10:16.660
a jamming space around art and I've seen other like kind of fun YouTube videos where they take

10:16.660 --> 10:21.540
an asset pack and they're like, okay, what can you come up with using this art asset pack? I like that

10:21.540 --> 10:25.940
kind of a, you know, a concept a little bit better than like, like the one I was going to do this

10:25.940 --> 10:31.220
weekend was the, the theme was rewind. It's like all the, anything I could think of that would just

10:31.220 --> 10:36.260
with time rewinding. And that sounded kind of boring. So that's why I couldn't think of

10:36.260 --> 10:43.140
anything. So I'm probably not going to do that one, but yeah, I like a lot of those jams,

10:43.140 --> 10:48.420
especially based around art assets. All right. Well, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight,

10:48.420 --> 10:52.580
which is not about an indie game. This is the furthest thing from an indie game. This is the

10:52.580 --> 10:58.420
mother of all AAA titles, but let's talk a little bit about Halo and some of the things that have

10:58.420 --> 11:05.220
happened since the, um, big reveal a couple of weeks ago. Loki. Yeah. So there was a rumor that,

11:05.220 --> 11:11.780
um, Halo Infinite was going to be free to play as far as the multiplayer goes. And this was coming

11:11.780 --> 11:21.780
from, I guess, a, it was published on, I think that the, um, a pre-order page and it was for

11:21.780 --> 11:27.860
this website Smith's Toys. And they had this like kind of little blurb on it said, you know,

11:27.860 --> 11:32.020
the legendary Halo series returns are the most expansive Master Chief campaign yet and

11:32.020 --> 11:37.540
groundbreaking free to play multiplayer experience. And so it talks about, um, you know, pretty

11:37.540 --> 11:42.740
plain. Everyone's like, Whoa, wait, what's going on? You know, what's this? And so finally it was

11:42.740 --> 11:49.300
confirmed by Microsoft, um, that yes, it is going to be free to play at least the multiplayer

11:49.300 --> 11:54.420
portion. There was some other websites that had listed the genre, I guess I want to say it was

11:54.420 --> 11:59.140
like a Japanese website or something like that. That was listing it like as almost like a battle

11:59.140 --> 12:06.260
royale. Um, so maybe there's going to be some battle royale mode to it. I wouldn't be surprised.

12:06.260 --> 12:09.940
A lot of games are kind of putting that in there, but at the very least it would be neat to see that,

12:09.940 --> 12:14.900
you know, multiplayer and Halo is definitely extremely popular and to make that accessible

12:14.900 --> 12:21.380
to everybody, um, at no cost is pretty great. That's a, I'd say another good selling point

12:21.380 --> 12:29.940
for that console. Now this has led to a lot of rampant speculation about Microsoft potentially,

12:29.940 --> 12:36.260
uh, walking away from Xbox gold basically, and, and making the multiplayer free, which, you know,

12:36.260 --> 12:39.860
and I don't want to sound like a broken record, but obviously this is something I've talked about

12:39.860 --> 12:44.900
on the show plenty of times before that I think this is a good direction for Microsoft one. I'm

12:44.900 --> 12:49.220
kind of surprised they didn't make sooner, but you know, in, in reflection, you know, hindsight's

12:49.220 --> 12:54.660
2020, it does make a lot of sense to maneuver it with a new generation that this is going to be,

12:54.660 --> 12:59.460
uh, like kind of like a new way of thinking, if you will, uh, about approaching this next

12:59.460 --> 13:05.780
generation. Now, um, to kind of follow up on that, we have, um, seen some articles and some tweets.

13:05.780 --> 13:11.220
And for example, over on our discord for vog network, which you can join over at vog

13:11.220 --> 13:16.500
network.com that's VOG network.com slash discord. And people chat with us throughout the week and

13:16.500 --> 13:19.540
so forth. And, uh, we have like an orange challenge radio room and people share their

13:19.540 --> 13:26.100
story ideas and so their thoughts on the show and tiger claw posted a story that has the headline

13:26.100 --> 13:32.660
Microsoft will discontinue Xbox live gold and make multiplayer free. And that part is in quotes.

13:32.660 --> 13:37.220
And if you go into, and when I first saw that, I was like, what, why haven't I seen this all over

13:37.220 --> 13:42.900
Twitter? Well, when you actually go into the story, it's a journalist from venture beat has

13:42.900 --> 13:47.540
arrived at the same conclusion that this must be the direction that they're going in, which by the

13:47.540 --> 13:52.900
way, Or something I really hate about social media headline sharing. And this is no, I'm not

13:52.900 --> 13:56.820
faulting tiger claw because it wasn't interesting. It's always nice to hear that somebody's thinking

13:56.820 --> 14:01.700
the same way you do. So I'm not faulting that. Please don't hear that. But, um, it, I, I,

14:01.700 --> 14:07.220
sometimes these gotcha headlines really irritate me. And we're really bad about that in the games

14:07.220 --> 14:12.420
world, especially, but obviously, you know, we've seen it play out in all political and all this

14:12.420 --> 14:20.020
other type of stuff, but, but I digress, um, Xbox going for free multiplayer would be quite

14:20.020 --> 14:26.980
the shift, um, with halo making that maneuver. Does it seem like this is the logical conclusion

14:26.980 --> 14:32.740
that we're going to get to that Xbox gold is going to go away? Um, actually, before I get your answer,

14:33.300 --> 14:38.420
one other thing to kind of file away game pass changed their branding at some point in the past

14:38.420 --> 14:42.500
few days. So there's no longer Xbox game pass or Microsoft game pass. They're just calling

14:42.500 --> 14:47.620
themselves game pass with the Xbox logo. You can see this on their Twitter account, although the

14:47.620 --> 14:51.540
actual name of the Twitter account hasn't changed. And maybe that's because they have to sort

14:51.540 --> 14:55.140
something out. Somebody probably took the other name, but the logo and some of the identity and

14:55.140 --> 15:01.540
that stuff has changed. So it does feel like chess pieces are moving around. I don't, what's your

15:01.540 --> 15:06.500
thoughts? Do you think this is what Microsoft is positioning themselves to do? I still don't know

15:06.500 --> 15:11.380
yet if I, I mean, I, it certainly seems like they're hinting at that's going to be the change.

15:11.380 --> 15:15.700
I would, wouldn't be surprised if maybe just gold goes away and it's all just what games pass.

15:16.260 --> 15:21.380
Um, I'd be interesting to see what goes on there. I don't know if necessarily with this halo

15:21.380 --> 15:25.460
announcement that necessarily indicates that they're going to be going that route with all

15:25.460 --> 15:29.540
games. I just say at the very least, we know now halo's multiplayer is going to be for free,

15:30.100 --> 15:35.860
um, and that they may sell the campaign separately. I think call of duty did something similar,

15:35.860 --> 15:40.740
not, uh, I know they did look like war zone and stuff. That's, um, free to play. So

15:42.100 --> 15:46.260
it may be just staying competitive in the marketplace with what's out there right now.

15:46.260 --> 15:51.060
Um, I think that they're going to make that announcement at some point soon,

15:51.060 --> 15:55.460
but very right now they haven't confirmed it. Very interesting comment from mr. 2, 100,

15:55.460 --> 16:00.740
Matt, everything's got a price. I'm waiting for the catch here. Could there be a catch,

16:00.740 --> 16:07.780
you know, I could definitely see where maybe while you're in matchmaking lobbies for, um,

16:07.780 --> 16:12.980
certain games, they're going to be a little more. And again, I am, I am completely fantasized. I'm

16:12.980 --> 16:16.820
kind of reading into this comment and going, I could see this happening. That maybe you're

16:16.820 --> 16:21.460
going to see advertisements and matchmaking lobbies. And so, I mean, heck we, it's not like

16:21.460 --> 16:26.420
we haven't seen advertisements inserted into games before we've seen like billboards that change and

16:26.500 --> 16:33.060
so forth, but maybe it would be a little more like less subtle. Like you're gonna see ads,

16:33.060 --> 16:38.340
uh, while you're waiting to play games and it'll be like, this match is brought to you in part by

16:38.340 --> 16:42.980
Colgate toothpaste, maybe try brushing your teeth. You know, I don't know what's going to happen,

16:42.980 --> 16:49.220
but that's gonna, that could be something I could see where Xbox might, you know, it's,

16:49.220 --> 16:53.460
it's free, but there's a catch and maybe make a little money there. I don't, what do you,

16:53.460 --> 16:57.860
do you think that's a road that could go down? I think that there are some companies that will

16:57.860 --> 17:02.500
go down the road EA. Um, but I don't know if necessarily that Microsoft's going to be doing

17:02.500 --> 17:06.500
that. I would see that they're probably going to be selling more cosmetic microtransactions

17:06.500 --> 17:13.060
and stuff like that. Um, but I think, I mean, really a lot of these companies could probably

17:13.060 --> 17:18.420
afford to have multiplayer for free considering how much money they make off of microtransactions.

17:18.420 --> 17:23.140
I don't know that necessarily we're going to see ads, but I mean,

17:24.180 --> 17:29.300
even if they were charging for multiplayer, I could see them doing ads during like waiting stuff.

17:29.300 --> 17:34.020
Yeah. But I mean, and who's to say though, with matchmaking being pretty quick, I don't know,

17:34.740 --> 17:37.620
like if you would, I don't know if they would do that though. Like,

17:38.980 --> 17:44.100
well, I guess we'll wait and see. Yeah, we'll see. I don't know. Um, uh, a chat name. I don't

17:44.100 --> 17:49.300
recognize somebody possibly knew or changed their name who said, uh, called, uh, no one special 77.

17:49.300 --> 17:55.060
Hello. No one special, uh, says, uh, possible catch 22. You know how with gold you pay for

17:55.060 --> 17:59.700
multiplayer, but they give you games for free. Maybe the game pass you pay for the subscription,

17:59.700 --> 18:04.580
but the multiplayer is free, but you need game pass to play. Uh, and you're not the first person

18:04.580 --> 18:08.740
that passed them. I wouldn't either. And you're not the first person in chat to suggest that,

18:08.740 --> 18:12.820
that maybe halo will be a little taste of that. But ultimately, and I think we've, we've heard

18:12.820 --> 18:18.900
the theory of the bundled package that essentially gold turns into game pass and it's everything.

18:18.900 --> 18:23.620
And, you know, I get that could, we don't want to assume we, we still have no confirmation for

18:23.620 --> 18:29.220
Microsoft on this. We know one game is doing it and it's a big one halo. So that lends itself to

18:29.220 --> 18:33.700
the possibility, you know, y'all love the feasibility scale on this show, right? So,

18:33.700 --> 18:37.700
or I'm sorry, it was plausible, uh, the plausibility scale, right? So it was a plausible

18:37.700 --> 18:41.140
Microsoft's going to throw it out for all games. Well, with, with them doing it for halo, it's

18:41.140 --> 18:46.340
certainly plausible, but, um, is it going to be a bundled thing either? And halo is just a taste.

18:46.340 --> 18:53.060
I don't know. I kind of think Microsoft's bread and butter now is game pass. They want to be

18:53.620 --> 18:59.620
Netflix for games before someone else beats them to it because Microsoft so many times in the

18:59.620 --> 19:04.340
industry has had to be playing catch up a little bit by trying to catch up to what somebody else

19:04.340 --> 19:08.340
has done. Microsoft is like, dang it. We're going to be the Netflix of the games industry.

19:08.340 --> 19:12.980
This is what we're doing. So I think what's going to happen when Microsoft goes to sell halo and

19:12.980 --> 19:19.700
the ads are on TV and all this stuff, they're not going to say $60 in store now or, uh, pre-order

19:19.700 --> 19:25.380
now they're going to say, get game pass to experience halo on day one. They're going to only

19:25.380 --> 19:31.780
push the game on game pass in their official advertising channels and the $60 retail. That's

19:31.780 --> 19:38.420
a footnote now. That's where I think they go with it, but that's again, just reading the tea leaves.

19:39.540 --> 19:44.820
Jamie, you think it's possible that they go this direction as well, um, to, uh, still making you

19:44.820 --> 19:49.940
pay for multiplayer, but it's like a game pass combo pack. Yeah. I think that's what they're

19:49.940 --> 19:54.180
going to do. And on top of that, I mean, if they had like a completely free option, then yeah,

19:54.180 --> 19:59.780
I think there would be like some sponsorship in there. Like, you know, you, I don't know,

19:59.780 --> 20:04.420
like something's going to limit it. Like if you want the full package, you have to have the,

20:04.420 --> 20:10.820
the full deal, you know, like the, the pass, does that make sense? Oh yeah. Yeah, it does. So they

20:10.820 --> 20:16.580
might, they might give a promised free, sorry, this wigs in my eyes. Um, they might give you

20:16.580 --> 20:25.140
like that promised free, but free always costs something when the game, you know, when the game

20:25.220 --> 20:31.300
companies are involved. As, as somebody in chat said earlier, ain't nothing free in this world,

20:31.300 --> 20:39.540
baby. You get Corona for free. Okay. Um, so let me ask one more question. So let's talk about

20:39.540 --> 20:43.620
what it might set the stage with competitively. I'm going to ask this question of chat. I'm going

20:43.620 --> 20:50.420
to ask this question of my host. So how competitive of a move does this end up being against Sony and

20:50.420 --> 20:56.580
Nintendo? Like if, if Microsoft really does go this direction, do you think Sony and Nintendo,

20:56.580 --> 21:00.980
and especially it's very interesting in Nintendo's perspective because Nintendo was kind of late to

21:00.980 --> 21:07.860
the party and charging for online. And, but, but I don't know, like I, my personal gut kind of says,

21:07.860 --> 21:13.460
but Nintendo kind of always gets away with doing whatever the hell they want because their games

21:13.460 --> 21:19.460
are so strong and Nintendo is the best developer in the business. And it's pretty convenient. They

21:19.460 --> 21:25.460
build their own hardware. So, um, but do you think this move has a competitive, especially

21:25.460 --> 21:30.980
when it comes to Sony, do you think it's going to put pressure on Sony to eliminate their online

21:30.980 --> 21:36.740
costs as well? Or is Sony going to say, well, we're giving you a better value because blah, blah,

21:36.740 --> 21:41.780
blah, blah, whatever excuse they come up with. I have a thought about that. And it's typically

21:41.780 --> 21:48.580
that not everybody is a multi-system owner, you know, like maybe we can swing having multiple

21:48.580 --> 21:54.020
systems, even though I don't have, you know, the newer Xboxes. Uh, but you know, when you come

21:54.020 --> 21:59.060
down to it, a lot of families are going to be a one console house, or if they have something,

21:59.060 --> 22:04.580
it's going to be a few generations old, or they've traded it in to buy whatever the new one. So

22:06.180 --> 22:11.380
going on that, I don't really think that Sony will have to do something like that.

22:11.380 --> 22:16.660
They'll still make their money. They may offer like more incentives for their paid services,

22:17.300 --> 22:21.540
but I don't really see that they would see a point in doing it. I don't think it would

22:21.540 --> 22:25.300
really frighten them. Hmm. Loki, any thoughts?

22:27.540 --> 22:30.900
I mean, they're going to say whatever they want. Nintendo probably be like, well, we offered a,

22:30.900 --> 22:36.180
you know, library of games, you know, first or I don't know. I think Nintendo isn't even going to

22:36.180 --> 22:42.420
care what they do. I can see Sony having to, um, counteract this with some sort of, uh, offering

22:42.420 --> 22:48.340
of PlayStation now for free, um, or at least including it with the price that you play for

22:48.340 --> 22:54.660
PlayStation plus, obviously, if there's a big discrepancy between the number of consoles being

22:54.660 --> 23:00.660
sold by platform, um, if it's in Sony's favor, I doubt that they're going to, you know, counter

23:00.660 --> 23:06.260
with, you know, putting out and they may even not in the beginning because they feel that they're,

23:06.260 --> 23:11.780
you know, they've got such a strong lead in the console space already, but if it becomes a point

23:11.780 --> 23:16.420
where they need to be competitive, then they would probably offer it up as well. Um, I think

23:16.420 --> 23:22.020
it's a good move for Microsoft to be doing this in the first place. If anything, if it gets us to,

23:22.020 --> 23:28.100
you know, at least give more value to, um, what you get each month. Cause I know with Microsoft,

23:28.100 --> 23:34.420
even as it is already, you get four games a month, you know, with Xbox live gold versus the two,

23:35.460 --> 23:38.820
maybe three, if they're feeling generous that month from Sony.

23:38.820 --> 23:42.820
So Sony's already kind of even backed down on what they used to give you. They used to

23:42.820 --> 23:47.460
get a ton of PSP and place it in three games and stuff like that. Um, it'd be nice if all

23:47.460 --> 23:52.740
that was compatible with like PlayStation now. And that was just a free service, but it's not. So

23:54.420 --> 23:59.300
I think, yeah, I think they need, the industry needs a kick in the pants and, um, this would

23:59.300 --> 24:04.420
definitely help with it. Uh, DJ Rama S in chat says, I don't think Sony is going to care until

24:04.420 --> 24:10.740
they start losing sales to Microsoft. So maybe Sony is kind of maybe, you know, these types of

24:10.740 --> 24:16.260
plans are years in development. So Sony might be marching forward because they didn't see this

24:16.260 --> 24:19.620
disruption in the industry potentially. And again, we don't know there's going to be disruption.

24:19.620 --> 24:24.660
It's one game that is, is reading into the tea leaves, but if there is disruption,

24:24.660 --> 24:29.860
Sony maybe didn't foresee it coming. And so maybe they don't have a response right away.

24:29.860 --> 24:35.380
And it's not until they potentially lose share to Microsoft that they're going to respond to it.

24:35.380 --> 24:42.340
But maybe Sony in a very similar way to Nintendo rests on the strength of their first party games

24:42.340 --> 24:48.020
to carry them through. Sony does have some very strong first party titles, obviously between,

24:48.020 --> 24:53.780
you know, the God of Wars, the horizons and et cetera, et cetera. I can go on. Um, Microsoft

24:53.780 --> 24:59.140
has always lagged behind in that department, right? But, and this is a big but, Teehee,

25:00.500 --> 25:05.700
Microsoft is really trying to change that from all the studios they've acquired and from what

25:05.700 --> 25:11.300
they showed you in this last presentation. This whole presentation that Microsoft did

25:11.300 --> 25:16.500
this past month, I don't think was just about being a giant advertisement for Game Pass.

25:16.500 --> 25:23.220
That was pretty good, but it's also definitely trying to say, hey, we have great first party

25:23.220 --> 25:32.340
titles too. Like Fable coming back, like Forza, like, you know, these new IPs coming from Obsidian

25:32.340 --> 25:36.260
and, you know, and then Psychonauts 2 and so on and so on. You guys get the picture, you know,

25:36.260 --> 25:40.900
Microsoft is really trying to compete on that level as well. So it's going to be very interesting.

25:40.900 --> 25:45.860
And I feel like a lot of gamers are, are at some point going to have to end up with three systems.

25:45.860 --> 25:51.220
Well, maybe not because again, Microsoft's games are all PC as well. So I think there's a lot of

25:51.220 --> 25:57.220
people that go, I'll just play those games on PC. I'll get Game Pass on PC and play my games there.

25:57.220 --> 26:04.420
Well, is that really a loss for Microsoft? No, not if you end up with a Game Pass PC subscription.

26:05.700 --> 26:11.780
So Bobby was saying in a chat there that obviously with, you know, the lack of, you know,

26:11.780 --> 26:17.620
a subscription for these Xbox Live Gold and stuff, it's like, who's paying for these online services?

26:17.620 --> 26:21.380
I think honestly what they've done is they looked at the amount of money that they're,

26:21.380 --> 26:26.820
you know, charging each month for Xbox Live Gold. So say, I think it ends up being, you know, like

26:26.820 --> 26:31.540
60 bucks a year or so. So like maybe almost like five bucks a month, maybe even more than that now.

26:31.540 --> 26:39.060
And they look at offering this, you know, say this library of games out there as is and the amount of

26:39.060 --> 26:44.020
money that they might make off of these microtransactions through these games. So if it's not

26:44.020 --> 26:48.500
necessarily first party, it could be third party games that they're getting a cut, you know, from

26:48.500 --> 26:55.460
those purchases as well. And that may be enough to offset the cost of paying that five dollars a

26:55.460 --> 27:01.140
month as it is. And they in fact, maybe making more money from that. So that's why I think they're

27:01.140 --> 27:06.340
allowing folks to have access to more games because it gives them more opportunity to spend money.

27:06.340 --> 27:10.180
And that's kind of even what we see from like Activision stuff. They're saying they're making

27:10.180 --> 27:17.540
billions of dollars off of just microtransactions alone and not necessarily game sales. So obviously

27:17.540 --> 27:23.300
if they open that market up to more people to have exposure to these games, there's a better

27:23.300 --> 27:27.860
opportunity to make more money than they would say just charging the subscription service. Plus it

27:27.860 --> 27:36.500
looks better. In my opinion, it's an investment type of thing. Microsoft does this now so that

27:36.500 --> 27:41.620
two, three years down the line, when everybody gets used to Game Pass, Game Pass is a standard.

27:41.620 --> 27:46.020
There's so many games now, all these first party developers have put their games out on Game Pass,

27:46.020 --> 27:51.460
that there's so much more strength to it, that then they jack up the price by another four

27:51.460 --> 27:56.260
dollars a month, just like Netflix did. Because remember when Netflix did the whole quickster

27:56.260 --> 28:02.740
thing and then that was like, everybody screamed, they kind of ended up doing it anyway. They just

28:02.740 --> 28:06.980
called it different things. And they ended up being able to jack up the price of Netflix while

28:06.980 --> 28:11.140
they were at it, because everybody was just so used to it at that point. And there's,

28:11.140 --> 28:15.460
oh, we're gonna charge an extra dollar or two for HD. Oh, we're in charge, or I'm sorry, not HD,

28:15.460 --> 28:20.580
but 4k, you know, all this other stuff. I, you know, and again, I might be a little bit cynical

28:20.580 --> 28:26.420
in that line of thinking. But investment, I think, is a reasonable answer to that question

28:26.420 --> 28:30.420
on how do you pay for it, is that you hope long term you're going to come out ahead.

28:32.820 --> 28:40.020
So, all right. So, interesting perspective on is what Microsoft's doing working. Pele

28:40.020 --> 28:44.900
Hanuman in chat says, it's working. My number one priority after getting a PlayStation 5 is getting

28:44.900 --> 28:50.660
a next gen Xbox. It's very true. SSG100Matt says, that's a good point. Rob is saying,

28:50.660 --> 28:55.220
for free now, but charge higher later. Ain't nothing in this world free, baby.

28:56.180 --> 29:02.900
That's anything. I mean, more than any service. Yeah. All right. And it comes down to also,

29:02.900 --> 29:06.100
though, I doubt that I don't think that they would do that right away if they did.

29:07.300 --> 29:12.500
It comes down to competition as well, what the competition is doing. So, I don't know,

29:12.500 --> 29:16.420
I think that it's still too early to say that's what they're going to do. Have they really done

29:16.420 --> 29:22.260
that with I mean, they did that with the Xbox Live Gold, but I think that's once if I remember

29:22.260 --> 29:28.420
correctly, they raised the price on that. But there's still the free games that they added to

29:28.420 --> 29:34.100
that as well. So, I don't know. We'll see. I mean, again, a lot of this is speculative.

29:34.100 --> 29:40.740
So, I'm going to move on, try to get some other less rumor topics discussed on the show. But

29:40.740 --> 29:43.860
I think it's very interesting. You know, again, this all plays into what is that, you know, kind

29:43.860 --> 29:49.780
of carrying over from last week's kickoff show. What does that next generation of gaming really

29:49.780 --> 29:55.060
look like? You know, and all this is going to really impact that. So, on what we look back on

29:55.060 --> 30:00.420
Gen, what are we going into now? Generation 8 of sorts, I think, with games. Although,

30:00.420 --> 30:04.340
Nintendo being the disrupter is kind of like, I don't know, where are they at? They're like

30:04.340 --> 30:10.980
seven and a half. I don't know. Anyway. All right. Let's move on. Let's talk about what generation

30:10.980 --> 30:15.460
of games are you playing this week in our gaming weeks? And the types of video games that you have

30:15.460 --> 30:18.820
been spending your time playing this week. Darsakha, we'll start with you. How was your

30:18.820 --> 30:24.980
gaming week? It was fairly productive. Hold on. Because I took a picture of some of the other

30:24.980 --> 30:29.380
stuff that I took to remind myself. So, not only, of course, I'm having a crap load of

30:29.380 --> 30:33.140
Animal Crossing, which I will be getting at seven o'clock so I can watch the fireworks.

30:33.140 --> 30:37.700
Just saying. Seven o'clock. I should have had you try to set up your Discord so you could switch to

30:37.700 --> 30:41.700
your game image so we could see that. But I guess all the East Coasters are already enjoying the

30:41.700 --> 30:46.340
fireworks. I've seen it on Twitter. Yeah. I don't know how to, I'd have to take some time and switch

30:46.420 --> 30:53.220
that up anyway. Yeah, I know. But we had some, well, I've had like my second visitor ever

30:53.220 --> 30:58.180
during the quarantine of my own and it was Becky and she brought Juliana over. He's gotten big.

30:58.180 --> 31:07.220
He's playing Sekiro. So, and Dark Souls and he's really going for it. But he and Dan were playing

31:07.220 --> 31:14.900
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe yesterday. And it was pretty amusing to listen to them banter. And we also

31:14.900 --> 31:22.100
have the Capcom beat-em-up bundle. You know, Knights of the Round, King of Dragons, you know,

31:22.980 --> 31:29.380
Captain Commando, a few other games on there. They're really fun. I mean, it's not like we

31:29.380 --> 31:34.580
don't have some of these on other collections, but it's nice to have access to them, especially

31:34.580 --> 31:39.620
the one that's semi-related to cyberbots. But for the life of me, I can't remember. It's like

31:39.620 --> 31:45.460
Armored something, Armored Warrior, not Armored Core. But at any rate, we had a lot of fun with

31:45.460 --> 31:53.060
that. And then we also got the Outrun Sega Ages collection. So it has a bunch of music in it just

31:53.060 --> 32:04.740
all over and different kinds of trials in the game. It's pretty fun. And I briefly mentioned

32:04.740 --> 32:12.020
it last week, but I also have the Sega Ages, Sega Saturn Fantasy Zone. And now I'm looking for a

32:12.020 --> 32:17.860
copy of Black Matrix for the Sega Saturn. So if someone wants to eBay that for me, that would be

32:17.860 --> 32:25.300
great. I need to find a translation of it though. But yeah, that's been a little pinball. We

32:25.300 --> 32:33.940
reorganized the front room. It's just been kind of up in the air, but now we have our vault kind

32:33.940 --> 32:43.140
of reset as a proper game room. And we're playing Lethal Enforcers on the Genesis with the Justifier.

32:43.140 --> 32:46.340
I really want to come over and play pinball at some point, but pandemic.

32:47.300 --> 32:52.980
So, well, if you, you know, if the both of us haven't been around people for, you know.

32:52.980 --> 32:57.140
Yeah, I got all that stuff. All that stuff. My dad's going on though. It's got to take priority.

32:57.140 --> 33:03.540
So I get it. I get it. And I'm pissed off at Dan cause he had people over in the garage and

33:03.540 --> 33:10.020
I had to go in there with a Lysol spray and just spray the air. I mean, this was actually pretty,

33:10.020 --> 33:16.660
pretty effective, but thankfully Dan stayed away for a little while and, and washed his hands and

33:16.660 --> 33:22.660
washed himself really well. I was already passed out, so I couldn't be mad last night, but yeah,

33:22.660 --> 33:28.260
we we've got game-age going on and more than there was a week before. So nah.

33:28.820 --> 33:31.380
All right. Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

33:31.780 --> 33:36.420
Um, so I did play a few things, uh, a lot of Minecraft this week, as usual,

33:36.420 --> 33:41.540
both of my kids wanted me to build them mansions. So I had to build two modern mansions for them,

33:42.180 --> 33:47.140
you know, just the small things here. We want a four story mansion, please. You know, can you,

33:47.140 --> 33:52.660
can you give me one? Dad, my requests are not unreasonable. All I want is a four story mansion,

33:53.540 --> 33:59.460
dad, make it happen. Exactly. So I did that. And then, um,

34:00.260 --> 34:08.820
I did play a little bit of a Paper Mario in the Origami King and I beat the first boss in that

34:08.820 --> 34:14.020
game. Uh, and then they have, I guess the first like kind of mini boss and then like the first

34:14.020 --> 34:20.420
boss in the game. And, uh, if, for those who may not know the games, bosses are, um, it's

34:20.420 --> 34:28.980
stationary stuff. So, um, the first boss has a pack of colored pencils and it's fantastic.

34:29.780 --> 34:34.340
I really love that game, uh, just in the art style and everything. So, um, pretty cool.

34:34.900 --> 34:38.980
And then a little bit of Orna, just the bare minimum. I really haven't been playing too much

34:38.980 --> 34:44.900
of that. Just doing, you know, my daily wars and whatnot. Uh, get on those wars. Cause you know,

34:44.900 --> 34:50.020
your kingdom master's a Dick when it comes to those wars, but we were losing too many by like

34:50.020 --> 34:53.620
a hair. And so we don't want to get matched against big guilds if we don't have active

34:53.620 --> 35:01.620
people. So, yeah. So, um, doing that and then, yeah, that's pretty much it. It's just, uh,

35:01.620 --> 35:07.380
those, those few games. Awesome. Uh, by the way, speaking of Orna, since that was a little bit of

35:07.380 --> 35:12.180
my game, we too, they did a big update today. Uh, and there's like the, it runs a lot smoother.

35:12.180 --> 35:15.380
Like I feel like I'm getting a better frame rate and they put some new fonts in it. So it looks

35:15.380 --> 35:18.340
kind of, it looks a little more, it looks a little different. It doesn't look completely

35:18.340 --> 35:21.700
retro now. It's gonna, the sprites haven't changed though. So it's still got a retro feel,

35:21.700 --> 35:25.700
but you have to check it out. Um, anyway, other stuff in my gaming week, I've also been playing

35:25.700 --> 35:30.100
animal crossing. I've had a lot of turnaround in my village in the last two weeks. I've

35:30.100 --> 35:36.420
lost three villagers and gained three new ones. So, um, I, um, I let Gigi go, she has to go,

35:36.420 --> 35:42.180
well, I lost Nana like about three weeks ago and I got Klaus who has a hilarious house because he

35:42.180 --> 35:46.180
lives in what looks like a bath house. Cause it's supposed to be like a throw to like ancient Greece

35:46.260 --> 35:50.740
and that's kind of like his aesthetic. So, um, and he's great. I like him for a smug type. He,

35:50.740 --> 35:56.020
uh, him and I get along. Uh, and then I lost Gigi. She asked to leave. Uh, and I was like,

35:56.020 --> 36:00.100
all right, you're a duplicate typing. So, uh, she left and I got a normal type to replace,

36:00.100 --> 36:04.740
uh, Nana who I didn't care for. Uh, and I got, uh, Norma, Norma, the normal.

36:06.420 --> 36:13.620
I love how some of the names are completely like I have Marshall. Yeah. I, I, I went Islander

36:13.620 --> 36:19.220
hunting yesterday and I found a villager named Snooty and I was like, I wonder what type of

36:19.220 --> 36:25.620
villager this one is. I let Julian go so I could bring Marshall in. Oh wow.

36:27.620 --> 36:32.580
I can get him back anytime. Oh, somebody or anybody's Island because we haven't

36:32.580 --> 36:38.020
been to anyone. We need more fruit because my wife wants to build out her orchard. Yes.

36:38.020 --> 36:42.100
My wife has basically taken over the entire Island and completely decorated everything

36:42.100 --> 36:47.140
because I don't play that game very much. Um, so she's redesigned everything, but yeah,

36:47.140 --> 36:50.740
she needs to visit some more islands too, or I should say I need to visit the islands because

36:50.740 --> 36:56.420
I have the Xbox or the Nintendo pass. Um, Jamie and I both have all the fruits,

36:56.420 --> 37:03.700
so visit one of us and you'll be set. All right, cool. Cool. Um, let's see. So, um, the,

37:03.700 --> 37:09.940
the hardest change I made into my villager lineup was I got Judy as a camper this week and I really

37:09.940 --> 37:13.780
wanted her because I'm like, she's kind of like different, right? She's newer for this one and

37:13.780 --> 37:17.300
she's got a really cute look. She's like a starry eyed bear and I know she's really popular. So I

37:17.300 --> 37:22.100
was like, all right, Judy. And I had to talk to her a bunch of times and the first villager Judy

37:22.100 --> 37:27.940
wanted to boot was catch up. And I was like, ah, and I instantly turned off the game and restarted

37:27.940 --> 37:31.460
it. If her said he was here, he would have screamed at me, but you can get away with it.

37:32.180 --> 37:38.820
So finally I settled on, she asked to kick rocket and I let her do it. And that was hard because

37:39.060 --> 37:44.340
rocket was one of my first two villagers though. So I was really attached to her. And so that was

37:44.340 --> 37:50.500
really hard. Yeah. But you know, Apple was my third and I booted her the fuck out. Here's the

37:50.500 --> 37:55.140
thing. Part of the game is turnaround. And you know, it's kind of one of those things. I was

37:55.140 --> 37:59.540
like, you know what? I can't hang on to the same 10 villagers forever or there, the game is not

37:59.540 --> 38:04.820
going to be interesting. So I had to let rocket go and rocket had an OG house for that reason too,

38:04.820 --> 38:07.940
because you know, they don't really get their personalized furniture. If they're one of your

38:07.940 --> 38:14.180
first two villagers. So I let Judy replace rocket. That was hard. And then the same day Judy moves

38:14.180 --> 38:20.100
in, I have another villager, Joey, who asked to leave and he was a duplicate typing, lazy type.

38:20.100 --> 38:26.980
So I just picked up boots, another jock, who's a really cute alligator. And I was like, okay,

38:26.980 --> 38:31.700
I'll take that. So yeah, that's as the animal crossing island turns, but I'm also excited to

38:31.700 --> 38:35.060
check out the fireworks show, but yeah, I've had a lot of turnover on my island this week.

38:35.860 --> 38:40.980
Um, other games I've been playing besides just that continued GPS stuff still doing,

38:40.980 --> 38:45.700
you know, Ingress, Pokemon Go, that stuff keeps me moving. Thanks to actdeft if you're out there

38:45.700 --> 38:49.300
listening tonight, because he invited me to a remote raid and I caught a Rayquaza yesterday

38:49.300 --> 38:55.060
that was kind of random. Some people just if they see me on they send me a remote raid and I try to

38:55.060 --> 39:00.020
do them if I see them. But there is sometimes a lag and I get sent invites where it's like,

39:00.020 --> 39:03.860
I'd already closed the game Niantic must not have shown that I went offline. So I'd already closed

39:03.860 --> 39:09.940
it. So yeah, but I love I'm loving the remote rating, that's for sure. And then a new game that

39:09.940 --> 39:14.660
I checked out this week was thanks to Xbox Game Pass, they just added a game called The Tourist,

39:14.660 --> 39:21.540
but it's spelled, it's like T O U R Y S T or so it's spelled differently. It's interesting because

39:21.540 --> 39:25.060
it's kind of like a little bit of a puzzler. And what made me want to play this game is that

39:25.060 --> 39:30.820
somebody tweeted that basically there's like a game inside the game. That's basically a

39:30.820 --> 39:37.860
Minecraft version of fast racing Neo remix on Nintendo Switch is like kind of inside that game

39:37.860 --> 39:42.420
and I thought that was really cool. So I was like, okay, I'm gonna check this game out on Game Pass

39:42.420 --> 39:49.460
and the aesthetic is very 3d.game heroes. Do you remember that game for the PS3? It was like one

39:49.460 --> 39:55.300
of the early titles. It was like Zelda with a very distinct look. That look is very like this,

39:55.300 --> 39:59.940
but it's not really the same type of game because 3d.game heroes was very Zelda inspired.

39:59.940 --> 40:05.620
This one is a little more of like a puzzler. I almost in some ways get throwbacks to like

40:05.620 --> 40:10.260
Solstice and Equinox, because you got that whole isometric puzzler type of thing,

40:10.260 --> 40:15.140
but not quite as actiony, at least not in the early stages I'm still in. A little more puzzle-y

40:15.140 --> 40:21.380
than actiony in those games. But yeah, that game's really cool and I want to play more of it. I

40:21.380 --> 40:28.100
admittedly did not get far into it, but I played enough. My curiosity, I was like, what happens if

40:28.100 --> 40:32.900
I swim way far out past the island? Cause the lifeguard says, don't go too far out or I can't

40:32.900 --> 40:37.780
see you. And my brain goes, that means there's treasure there. So I swam out as far as I could

40:37.780 --> 40:41.780
and I got eaten by a shark. And that was really funny. Cause the shark just pops out of the water,

40:41.780 --> 40:48.500
goes like attacks your character. Yeah, pretty much. It just jumps up.

40:49.620 --> 40:55.460
I looked up the, uh, the, um, pictures of it online. It looks, I like the aesthetic of that.

40:55.460 --> 41:00.420
Yeah. It's very like Minecraft. In fact, when I was playing it, Alan came in the room and was

41:00.420 --> 41:04.100
like, Oh, is this like a Minecraft license game? Is this like a new mine? And I'm like, no, it's

41:04.100 --> 41:08.020
not, it's not really related to Minecraft. It just has that aesthetic. And yeah, it really reminded

41:08.020 --> 41:12.740
me of 3d.game heroes. It's that whole, like, see the arcade. So they have like multiple arcade

41:12.740 --> 41:17.060
games in there. Cause it looks like I haven't gotten to the arcade yet. So I can't tell you

41:17.060 --> 41:23.140
it's not in the very first island. It's not in the second island either. So yeah. Yeah. So anyway,

41:23.700 --> 41:28.180
I thought it was neat, so I'll play more of it. So, uh, I liked it, but I wanted, I'm like,

41:28.180 --> 41:33.140
I got to play something new. I can't just rely on the old standards, but of course I've still been

41:33.140 --> 41:37.860
playing lots of final fantasy 14. Like I spend easily an hour and a half every night, but that's

41:37.860 --> 41:43.380
just like. Shane and other friends and I running a dungeon or something and just chatting and,

41:43.380 --> 41:48.980
you know, just leveling our characters, continuing to level my samurai. Why don't know, just killing

41:48.980 --> 41:54.020
time until that next patch. Although the next big content patch for Final Fantasy 14 is next

41:54.020 --> 42:00.740
Tuesday, August 11th. So it's fine. This is after a big delay. Final Fantasy 14 has been very good

42:00.740 --> 42:05.140
on the content patches. It's like every few months there's a patch, but we've had a really big dry

42:05.140 --> 42:10.180
spell between these last two patches, but understandably it's the whole COVID-19 issue

42:10.180 --> 42:14.980
that's caused this to be delayed a little bit. So we got to cut them a little bit of slack. So,

42:14.980 --> 42:19.460
but I'm excited to check out that new expansion or I'm sorry, new patch. There's no expansion

42:19.460 --> 42:26.900
yet. Maybe until next year probably. Okay. Let's move on and get into some gaming news. Oh,

42:26.900 --> 42:31.780
actually one other thing I should talk about, or I'm going to get an angry phone call later

42:31.780 --> 42:37.940
in the show. One thing that was kind of my gaming week, I backed a Kickstarter this week

42:37.940 --> 42:45.540
and it was that Iodine Chronicle 100 Heroes that I actually ended up backing. And after Shane

42:45.540 --> 42:49.380
reminded me every day, did you back it yet? Did you back it yet? Did you back it yet? I'm like,

42:49.380 --> 42:55.540
yes, God, leave me alone. So, but I won. I really do want it. So, cause I, I enjoyed Suikoden and I,

42:55.540 --> 43:02.020
the little trailer that they're showing for the new one looked really good. So, yeah.

43:02.820 --> 43:09.220
Um, I backed that and, um, I'll be excited to play that game in two years,

43:09.220 --> 43:14.180
but apparently the Kickstarter is doing very well. Um, by the time I backed it, it was up to like

43:14.180 --> 43:18.820
somewhere around 2.4, 2.5 million. I don't know. It's probably gone up even higher.

43:18.820 --> 43:22.980
Um, and they're starting to release a lot of the, um, stretch rewards. Like it's going to

43:22.980 --> 43:27.140
come to consoles. They've hit that. They're starting to add new characters. They're hitting

43:27.140 --> 43:31.620
all of these. There's some additional localizations they're putting in. So the Kickstarter is doing

43:31.780 --> 43:37.220
very, very well. Some may even, I mean, it depends who you talk to. Some may say better than expected.

43:37.220 --> 43:44.260
Some may say, uh, you know, we knew Suikoden fans wanted this for a long time. So you gotta wonder

43:44.260 --> 43:49.380
if Konami is sitting there going, well, shit, maybe we should have got on this sooner, but

43:49.380 --> 43:53.460
Konami as a company has been mismanaged for how many years? So, you know, what can you do?

43:53.460 --> 43:58.180
Uh, very happy for the developers that they get to make another, a spiritual successor of sorts. And

43:58.260 --> 44:05.300
I'm excited to check it out. Um, all right, let's move on and talk about some of the news from the

44:05.300 --> 44:09.860
week. And, uh, Loki, let's talk about this one. This is a big one that's got everybody talking,

44:09.860 --> 44:14.660
right? Yeah. So we kind of talked a little bit about like some of the stuff that leaked out

44:14.660 --> 44:20.980
about this huge gig leak. So basically there was a bunch of Nintendo development stuff that got

44:20.980 --> 44:26.660
leaked out a while back. Um, I'm not sure if this is separate from the last huge leak that we had,

44:26.660 --> 44:35.060
but this is definitely, uh, same leak trickling out the information and parsing. Yeah. Yes. So

44:35.060 --> 44:40.660
a lot of development stuff, there is a lot of source code for different games and whatnot. So

44:40.660 --> 44:46.420
some of the things of note to mention out of the leak. So one of the things that was in there was

44:46.420 --> 44:52.260
the source code for star Fox two, which has recently got put on to of course the classic,

44:52.260 --> 44:57.780
uh, SNES console. And I believe now is also part of the Nintendo online,

44:57.780 --> 45:03.300
a collection of games, character designs though. Yes. As the character design. So they had a lot

45:03.300 --> 45:08.100
of different character designs, something that necessarily go with, but there was one that was,

45:08.100 --> 45:13.540
um, a human character as well, a pilot, a black female that was in there. They also had a bunch

45:13.540 --> 45:17.780
of different animal pilots as well, that, uh, all sorts of different animals. It kind of reminds me

45:17.860 --> 45:22.260
a little bit of a Zootopia a little bit, uh, but lots of different designs that they had,

45:22.260 --> 45:26.660
uh, toyed with, but didn't end up going with, uh, some of the other cool stuff.

45:26.660 --> 45:33.700
They had different character design for Luigi for super Mario world. Um, speaking of Luigi,

45:33.700 --> 45:41.780
they had art assets for Luigi in, um, Mario 64, but obviously unused as well. Um,

45:41.780 --> 45:49.060
with no L on his hat. Right. Right. Yes. Yeah. And then, um, there was a bunch of other random

45:49.060 --> 45:53.540
assets. They had some early art assets from super Mario carts, which actually had looked like a

45:53.540 --> 45:58.740
human player in there instead of the Mario stuff. I could maybe see them doing like some sort of

45:58.740 --> 46:05.780
like, uh, I don't know, uh, maybe using it as a prototype to build everything else out. Also,

46:05.780 --> 46:11.060
they had the cart was, they had a version that was a hovercraft as well, instead of just a regular,

46:11.060 --> 46:17.300
uh, cart. Oh, huh. Uh, yeah, that's kind of neat. That would work for that aesthetic of game too.

46:17.300 --> 46:20.340
I didn't even really think of that. I didn't, I didn't pick up on that one. I saw the Mario

46:20.340 --> 46:26.020
cart with the different music. I heard that and the original music. It wasn't, it seemed a little

46:26.020 --> 46:32.980
like maybe dreamy and sad for a Mario cart game, but I liked it. I sure did. Yeah. What about the

46:32.980 --> 46:38.500
animal crossing stuff? Yes, the animal crosses stuff. So animal, Jamie's like, get to the good

46:38.500 --> 46:44.740
shit, wrap it up, wrap it up, get to what I want to hear. Apparently, and for animal forest, uh,

46:44.740 --> 46:50.900
there was art assets for blathers as one of the animals in the game and he wasn't in the game yet.

46:51.460 --> 46:55.860
No, he was not. So that'd be cool if you could get blathers as one of your villagers.

46:55.860 --> 47:04.900
Uh, also there was, I believe our assets for caddy for caddy. Yeah, caddy. She looks pretty terrible,

47:04.980 --> 47:10.100
but those brows, you know? Yes. And then, um, I want to say they were also talking about,

47:10.100 --> 47:14.340
it possibly is going to be human characters as well in there. So that was kind of neat.

47:14.340 --> 47:18.660
I think it was some of the MPCs like there was, they were going to have more like MPC humans,

47:19.860 --> 47:24.180
but there was something cool though about when they leaked the source code for that,

47:24.180 --> 47:30.100
it had the emulator source code in it too. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a big, big thing.

47:31.060 --> 47:35.460
Yeah. Lots of emulator source codes. I know they also had, uh, like official emulators,

47:35.460 --> 47:41.780
um, that were from the DS as well that were leaked with that. Um, lots of information.

47:41.780 --> 47:44.420
I think it's going to be a while before they finally go through all of this,

47:44.980 --> 47:51.140
but it is interesting. I understand that ethically it's not great, but I like always seeing all this

47:51.140 --> 47:55.220
development stuff and kind of what could have been, and you know, what stuff looked like at

47:55.220 --> 48:00.580
one point and just learning a bit more from that. Um, it'd be pretty cool to see what they

48:00.580 --> 48:06.340
do with this plus within the Luigi stuff in there and the leaked version of the source code for

48:07.220 --> 48:13.860
Mario 64 that they've now gotten to run on PC. Um, I would be curious to see that. Oh,

48:13.860 --> 48:18.260
I guess that's not necessarily the source code that it was a rebuilding of that. Um,

48:18.260 --> 48:22.420
I wonder if they can incorporate the Luigi stuff in there as well. That'd be pretty cool.

48:22.420 --> 48:28.980
I mean, granted, I think, uh, the Nintendo 64 or not, the DS version of Mario 64 had some

48:28.980 --> 48:34.100
multiplayer in there as well, but, um, it'd be interesting to see what they are able to do with

48:34.100 --> 48:39.060
this. And then the most random one thing I saw there was someone pointing out that there was

48:39.060 --> 48:48.180
a textures for, uh, Beavis from Beavis and Butthead and, uh, F zero X. I don't know. There's a lot of

48:48.180 --> 48:51.940
like weird stuff that they used to like put placeholder in there. Um, I know there's like a

48:51.940 --> 48:59.060
place that way. So, um, let me, I gotta, I have to bring this point out because our chat, our chat is

48:59.060 --> 49:02.900
getting into it here. I know there's plenty more to talk about, but you know, a very real point

49:02.900 --> 49:07.460
here from Bobby in our chat room saying the thing about this whole story is that sucks is that this

49:07.460 --> 49:11.860
is corporate theft. I know it's interesting, but we're celebrating corporate theft here.

49:11.860 --> 49:16.100
I don't know if celebrate is the word I would use. Like, this is one of the things we're like,

49:16.100 --> 49:20.980
it happened, we didn't do it, but it's out there now. And it's, you know, we're all kind of like

49:20.980 --> 49:27.060
looking into it. Um, it's kind of like the Sony pictures, email leaks. Like that was a crime

49:27.060 --> 49:32.740
that was theft or, you know, it's not like we rated the Parthenon and stole, you know,

49:32.740 --> 49:37.300
Greek architecture from it like a hello British museum. And to be fair, to be fair, I don't think

49:37.300 --> 49:40.660
Bobby is like saying, you guys shouldn't talk about it because everybody's talking about it.

49:40.660 --> 49:45.700
So I think when he says that he means like we, as the, you know, gaming fans are sitting here,

49:45.700 --> 49:49.700
like diving into this going, Ooh, isn't this fascinating? Ooh, this is cool. But I mean,

49:49.700 --> 49:55.940
at the end of the day, it's stolen shit. Like this is not stuff that was meant for public eyes,

49:55.940 --> 50:01.780
you know, and, and now this has another quandary out there. Do you, can you count this as gaming

50:01.780 --> 50:09.540
history or should stuff that was sent to the trash be private? I don't know. It's, it is a

50:09.540 --> 50:15.220
moral dilemma and not one I'm sure we can easily answer here on OLR. Um, and this is one that I

50:15.300 --> 50:20.740
think a lot of historians are struggling with right now because yeah, like Luigi and Mario 64,

50:20.740 --> 50:27.300
that's huge, but that was put in the bin. It wasn't supposed to ever be found. These character

50:27.300 --> 50:32.500
designs for Star Fox 2, again, another great example. Yeah, the pilot designs all looked

50:32.500 --> 50:37.060
awesome, but the reality is they're not real. You know, you know what I mean? When I say that,

50:37.060 --> 50:41.140
right? They're not real because they didn't get to that finish line in the game. And you even have

50:41.140 --> 50:46.660
some designers going like, wow, I kind of like forgot about all that stuff. So like, I don't

50:46.660 --> 50:52.820
know, like there's that part of me that's like, ah, I wish Nintendo, you know, okay, make lemons

50:52.820 --> 50:58.980
out of lemonade. Like this, this happened. It's unfortunate. It sucks. This happened,

51:00.020 --> 51:07.380
but maybe the silver lining here. And I'm kind of going back to an old adage that I think of,

51:07.700 --> 51:12.740
you know, I love my drag queens. And I think it was Alaska was the drag queen that said,

51:12.740 --> 51:16.100
you know, if they're going to drag you over the internet about it, put it on a t-shirt and sell

51:16.100 --> 51:20.500
it. And that's kind of the thing I'm giving, that's the advice I'm giving to Nintendo here.

51:20.500 --> 51:25.540
You know what? This sucks that this happened, but maybe it shows that there's like people

51:25.540 --> 51:31.860
are drooling and salivating for a little more of this gaming history here. So why not put out an

51:31.860 --> 51:38.100
app on the switch, charge $1.99 for it and start filling it slowly with videos, kind of looking

51:38.100 --> 51:44.020
back and basically selling people some of the information that's in this leak that's already

51:44.020 --> 51:50.740
out there anyway. And Nintendo can do this. They did this on the 3DS with that video app that they

51:50.740 --> 51:55.220
slowly populated with the Dino office every other week and all that stuff, right? So Nintendo could

51:55.220 --> 51:58.900
kind of like do that and like, oh, and this one, we're going to look back on the design of Mario

51:58.900 --> 52:03.700
Kart and how it got from here to there. And, you know, yes, I understand Nintendo wanted to keep

52:03.700 --> 52:09.940
it secret. Nintendo didn't want this out there as well. Well, it happened. So yeah, like make a buck

52:09.940 --> 52:16.580
off it or something. I love that watching those GDC or the GDC talks where they do kind of like

52:16.580 --> 52:20.900
a post-mortem of different games and talking about the development process and like some of

52:20.900 --> 52:25.540
the decisions that they made and stuff. I always find that stuff to be very fascinating. So I would

52:25.540 --> 52:34.340
love to hear about some of this stuff. Like the Yoshi iterations, like first Yoshi was kind of a

52:34.340 --> 52:39.540
hideous freak. The fun thing is that if you know some of the developmental history of some of these

52:39.540 --> 52:44.260
games, you're actually looking back at that point in history, like the little human writers that

52:44.260 --> 52:51.220
were in Mario Kart were actually just placeholders for a different kart game that it was going to be.

52:51.220 --> 52:57.460
So, I mean, that's really all that those were. There was a, I think I did, you know, gaming about that.

52:57.460 --> 53:04.900
But for me, I know it actually, I guess, kind of semi makes up for something that I got really

53:04.900 --> 53:11.540
pissed off about. The channel that does Boundary Break had a boundary break for

53:11.540 --> 53:15.700
Animal Crossing and Nintendo took it down. And I have a feeling that since the guy published through,

53:15.700 --> 53:21.140
I think he published through Final Cut, if you publish directly from the app, then if the video

53:21.140 --> 53:27.940
is taken down, they can actually take your assets. So for me, this is kind of like getting a little

53:27.940 --> 53:34.100
bit back, at least on something older to see how it's put together. I mean, Rob can vouch for this.

53:34.100 --> 53:39.940
How many times did I post like behind the scenes stuff for World of Warcraft? You know, when I got

53:39.940 --> 53:44.580
my demon hunter, I was breaking that shit all the time. You know, I like to see what's behind the

53:44.580 --> 53:52.660
scenes. And this for me, it's old. The assets are old. I don't know that, especially for the

53:52.660 --> 53:57.940
old Animal Crossings, I don't know if we're going to be getting Animal Forest E Plus as a rerelease

53:57.940 --> 54:03.220
anytime soon. Just saying. I don't feel, I don't feel that bad about it. I really don't feel that

54:03.220 --> 54:10.020
bad about it. So it's a Pandora's box type of issue. But the reality is it's been open and it's

54:10.020 --> 54:16.580
out there now. So you know, and I, the information is out there. So, you know, I, again, I kind of

54:16.580 --> 54:24.020
land on what I hope Nintendo kind of can do is take this kind of bad situation and lean into it

54:24.020 --> 54:29.620
a little bit and sort of go, all right, well, if it's out there, then let's try to put some context

54:29.620 --> 54:35.140
to it and sell that and make money off of it. Because otherwise the information is just floating

54:35.140 --> 54:39.380
around out there. And they'd be naive to think they're going to shut down every YouTube and

54:39.380 --> 54:43.380
everything out there on the internet. Although y'all should be warned, they're going to try.

54:43.380 --> 54:48.180
And that's, you'll notice why I don't have any of this on display right now. We can talk about it.

54:48.180 --> 54:56.020
It's news, but I, I'm not putting it on screen, just in case, which I, at the end, I seriously

54:56.020 --> 55:03.460
doubt Nintendo would come after this, but, you know, why, why, why risk it? So it's, it's out

55:03.460 --> 55:08.900
there. If you, if you want to go look and you arrive at that moral conclusion that you can go

55:08.900 --> 55:18.580
look, then it's very easy to do. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I, I'm curious. That being said,

55:18.580 --> 55:25.380
I'm still very curious about more stuff to come out. So let me see more things. Show me more,

55:25.380 --> 55:31.460
more things that you find. I just saw one. It was the, a test model for the Super FX chip that was

55:31.460 --> 55:38.900
link. I mean, a very low poly version of link that like is something you would see. Well,

55:38.900 --> 55:43.540
obviously during that era, but, um, it was still pretty cool and they got to import it into

55:43.540 --> 55:48.580
Starbucks to be able to see it. Yeah. I'm kind of like, I'm I'm for me, I'm kind of like, it is,

55:48.580 --> 55:53.700
it is fascinating, but it does feel really dirty. Like it, it definitely feels like it's dirty.

55:53.700 --> 55:57.700
And I think the thing that would set me off, which thankfully I haven't seen on my Twitter feed,

55:57.700 --> 56:02.820
maybe I'm curating it very well. Um, is I think if somebody were to say, well, that looks like

56:02.820 --> 56:07.940
garbage. I can't believe Nintendo was doing that. I would probably pop off on that because you

56:07.940 --> 56:13.940
weren't supposed to see it. So don't go given that negative context to it. You know, it was put in

56:13.940 --> 56:18.980
the bin for a reason or whatever. So luckily I'm not seeing that at least on my feed, but it's the

56:18.980 --> 56:23.860
internet. I'm sure it's out there somewhere. Um, because there's so much negativity, unfortunately,

56:23.860 --> 56:27.860
sometimes in gamer circles, I'm sure there are people that are using this information to pick

56:27.860 --> 56:34.340
on Nintendo. And that is, that is very unacceptable, like beyond unacceptable in my opinion.

56:34.340 --> 56:39.380
Um, but it's one of those things where I'm kind of like, it happened, we can't change it. We can't

56:39.380 --> 56:46.100
unput the information on the internet. Um, I hope Nintendo will try to embrace it and make the best

56:46.100 --> 56:52.020
out of it that they can. So, yeah. All right. Well, let's move on. Let's talk about, let's

56:52.020 --> 56:56.500
talk about some things that, um, maybe in the future, let's talk about less about gaming's

56:56.500 --> 57:01.620
past and look more at gaming's future for something that may be a part of the PlayStation

57:01.620 --> 57:08.340
five. Uh, and one of those features is the potential of an activity button. Uh, and this

57:08.340 --> 57:15.940
is coming from, uh, a European outlet named game reactor who did a preview of a racing game, WRC

57:15.940 --> 57:20.980
nine, uh, which is going to be launching on the current gen like PlayStation four, Xbox one, as

57:20.980 --> 57:26.660
well as the next gen PlayStation five. Now, as part of the presentation, there was an activities

57:26.660 --> 57:32.500
function that was demonstrated described as an instant deep link to specific races directly from

57:32.500 --> 57:38.740
the PlayStation five's menu. There was even a tweet about it that said, uh, or features such

57:38.740 --> 57:44.340
as PS five's activities feature in parentheses, an instant deep link to specific races directly from

57:44.340 --> 57:48.100
the console's menu. I pretty much read the same thing twice. Sorry, but that's what it said on

57:48.100 --> 57:55.220
the tweet that is now gone. Um, so somebody probably asked for that to get pulled. Um,

57:55.220 --> 58:00.580
so this could be a thing that's in PlayStation five's future. Think of it as an, it is kind of

58:00.580 --> 58:04.580
one of those things where I was like, really? That's a feature. Just jump right to level two

58:04.580 --> 58:09.860
or something. But if you think about it, some games, they take a long time to configure, you

58:09.860 --> 58:14.500
know, it's like, okay, press the start money menu to begin loading, loading, loading, loading,

58:14.980 --> 58:19.060
select which race you want to do to player, select your vehicle, loading, loading, loading,

58:19.060 --> 58:23.380
loading, you know, and then you'll finally, it takes a while and you get into the race.

58:24.020 --> 58:27.940
And what if there was a way you could say, you know what, I want to set this up as a shortcut

58:27.940 --> 58:34.180
so that I just go right into the action. And I do feel like the speed of playing the game,

58:34.180 --> 58:38.820
the speed of getting in there is something that they're really pushing on PlayStation five with

58:38.820 --> 58:43.940
their solid state drive, as well as, you know, Xbox series X to an extent as well. You've seen

58:43.940 --> 58:47.860
some of the things out there where they've talked about, like, you're going to be able to keep

58:47.860 --> 58:52.660
multiple game instances open in the background and kind of jump right to your position in one

58:52.660 --> 58:58.340
game or the other. So definitely that speed of jumping right in there is something we're hearing

58:58.340 --> 59:05.860
a lot about. So this makes a lot of sense from that perspective. Do you think this is a feature?

59:06.420 --> 59:11.300
Does this seem like something that you might actually use in a game? The activities feature,

59:11.380 --> 59:16.660
and I asked this of our chat as well, assuming it happens again, this is not confirmed,

59:16.660 --> 59:22.580
but something that may be spilled out here. Probably not. You don't think it's true?

59:23.620 --> 59:31.860
No. I mean, if it's something that I would use. Oh, sorry. Gotcha. Oh, did you want to elaborate?

59:31.860 --> 59:36.980
I'm sorry. No, I just said no. As Joe and Matt says, I find this rather interesting and it fits

59:36.980 --> 59:42.500
with Sony really pushing hard for non-existent load times. Yeah, it does kind of fit into that,

59:42.500 --> 59:51.700
so it makes a lot of sense. Let me ask this of chat. Is there any game that you can think of

59:51.700 --> 59:57.780
where this feature would be really useful? Like, I want to use a feature like this in this game.

59:57.780 --> 01:00:02.500
It could be something that exists today. That's fine. I can think of several ideas for this. So,

01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:07.940
for example, say you have Call of Duty and you play a lot of Call of Duty or something like that,

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:17.140
you could have a link or whatever that says jump to quick match lobby or something like that, where

01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:21.700
it'll basically just throw you in. You don't have to load the game up, load up multiplayer,

01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:28.340
load up quick match. It'll just put you straight into that lobby to be able to play that game type.

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:35.380
I can see that as a thing. Not so much like, say, oh, I'm pulling up Gran Turismo and I want to

01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:40.820
race a specific track. I think that's more something that can be implemented software-wise.

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:44.660
But, yeah, I can see where there should be some value there.

01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:52.100
I can definitely see. Sony is working a lot more with trying to kind of push their consoles the

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:56.820
definitive place to play Fortnite. You've kind of seen with that investment. I can definitely

01:00:56.820 --> 01:01:00.980
see. It just seems obvious that you would see something in Fortnite where it's like,

01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:05.460
jump into Battle Royale default settings just right now. Let's just go. Get on the bus.

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:09.780
So, I could see something without having to go through all the other screens and configuration.

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:15.780
I could definitely see something like that being, I think, something that'd show off. It would be so

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:22.260
requested by people, I bet. I wish they'd have something like it for Final Fantasy XIV, where

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:27.700
I could just bypass the login screen. I know I need a password to kind of keep things protected

01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:31.300
and stuff, but I don't know. I wish there was a way to make that whole process faster. You know

01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:36.740
what I mean? I just want to jump in the game. Just bring me to my main character or ask me for my

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:42.500
two-factor auth password once and let's get in. You know what I mean? Instead of, select your

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:48.020
server, select your character. Well, they sort of do like, going back even, they sort of did that

01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:54.500
way. I mean, granted, not a great example because Grand Theft Auto 5. I mean, that is one of those

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:59.700
next-gen games now that we're touting that for PlayStation 5, even though it's been out for a

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:04.500
couple generations already. But one of the options that they had there was to be able to load

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:12.580
directly into Grand Theft Auto Online, which saves some time because the load times on that are

01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:17.140
incredibly long. I'm hoping that, obviously, with a solid-state drive that they'll be much faster,

01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:21.940
but it is something that they kind of had that idea in mind where you could just bypass some of

01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:26.820
the load screens that way. But if they have this new feature where it's going to load things

01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:32.580
much faster, then I could definitely see them just having it instantly jump into something like that.

01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:38.180
That would be pretty cool. SSG100Matt in chat says, I envision it similar to having multiple tabs open

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:42.980
in a browser. You could, in theory, have multiple games playing at once and just jump around from

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:48.820
game to game, instance to instance, like switching tabs in a browser. My understanding is that is

01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:53.860
what Microsoft has already talked about for Xbox Series X, is that basically you can have multiple

01:02:53.860 --> 01:03:02.500
game sessions open. I just think that's kind of a waste. I mean, it wouldn't be anything that I

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:08.820
would use. But no, I have ADD. I have to play four games at once, okay? It's fine. Well, I mean,

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:17.060
I could kind of see it for myself because I do sometimes jump to like, oh, I just kind of want

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:20.500
to see what's on Twitch. Is anybody streaming? Okay, no, nobody's streaming. All right, I'm going

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:23.780
to go into this game and I'm going to take care of these things. Okay, now I just want to get into

01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:28.660
this game. If something like this was on Nintendo Switch, I could see myself like, okay, I just want

01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:34.180
to jump into Animal Crossing, do some of the tasks on my islands. Okay, I'm done. Let's go into the

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:38.580
next game. You know what I mean? And let me pick off where I left off on Xenoblade Chronicles.

01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:43.780
You know, I could sort of see it, especially if there are games where you have kind of like daily

01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:50.180
tasks that you go through, if that makes sense. But I can also see that, yeah, I mean, there are

01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:56.820
features on every console that some people don't ever use them. There's a lot other OS on PlayStation

01:03:56.820 --> 01:04:01.780
3. There's a lot of people that never used it. There's some people that really freaking miss it.

01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:05.620
You know, it's just one of those things where different strokes for different folks.

01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:13.380
So, all right. Yeah, SD100Matt says, I'm bouncing between streaming apps and games all the time.

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:16.740
You know, and I'm guilty of this too, is that I'll be playing a video game. Oh, wait, hold on,

01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:21.540
pause a minute. Check my phone, check my Twitter feed. What's going on? And back to it. Like,

01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:25.540
I almost think it would be almost more valuable and who knows, maybe this is the direction they'll

01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:30.900
go, is if I could just hit a button and see the latest posts on my Twitter feed or what the latest

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:35.380
Twitter trends are. Okay, well, now I see what's going on there. All right, let me go back. And

01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:40.260
for some people, that would be sports scores. For some people, that would be stock market. You know,

01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:44.580
whatever it is that you're into, you flip to another tab, check it. Okay, now back to my game.

01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:52.420
So, could be interesting. All right, moving on. Let's talk about some other events and Dark

01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:59.860
Soccer alluded to this earlier. Yes, because, and I am doing it right the fuck now. I actually,

01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:05.860
I put some of it on the stream. There is a new, well, it's already out the new update

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:11.220
for Animal Crossing New Horizons. And it has brought in a few things that I was super excited

01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:19.380
about. So, you get Luna's bed, which you can then dream and Luna comes out. She was introduced in

01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:25.460
New Leaf. We could visit the dream villages and people had very interesting dream villages. And

01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:31.300
I will put it out there for anyone curious. I could village is back. And it is creepy. It

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:38.900
looks like it's still a bit in work in progress. But fuck it's creepy. Okay, so anyway, you also

01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:44.820
have cloud backups. And that's very important to us the first thing, one of the first things I set

01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:52.980
up. So basically, the cloud backups are going to be if your system is lost or stolen, and you have

01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:58.020
to replace your system, you can restore your Animal Crossing village as of the last time

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:06.500
that it it backed up. And the game will of course do a backup when you aren't playing it. So really

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:12.100
useful tool. I know I tell everyone back up everything back up your computer backup everything

01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:18.740
and your village with all the time and effort we put into it should really be no different. And

01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:25.700
then the thing I'm doing right now fireworks and you can do custom fireworks although I'm checking

01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:30.180
mine out and I don't I just put some of my patterns up there. But I'm not seeing any

01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:36.820
Bob bombs or money bags or trogdor or anything like that. Huh? So I have I guess maybe they're

01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:42.180
not going in now or maybe I have to set it off myself. You you know, you know, there are thousands

01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:48.500
of islands in the world right this moment. Having a dick celebration with their fireworks. You know

01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:58.740
and hold on for for our live listeners. I have it held up to the camera. It's a little blurry,

01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:03.140
but you can see. Yeah, I see some fireworks going off in the background there. So it's

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:07.940
otherwise kind of looks pretty calm. Oh, no, there we go. Okay, so some larger fireworks are kind of

01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:12.340
going off. They look pretty standard. It looks pretty it's a different look for the game. It's

01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:16.820
something different. It's one thing I've really enjoyed and Dan and I were having this talk the

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:25.380
other day was how well lit and and how good the sound is in the game. Like it really makes use of

01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:29.620
a pseudo surround when you're playing a handheld or when you're playing it on your TV. It'll use

01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:34.980
your surround system. So like you'll hear sounds come in and out very subtle noises as you play

01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:38.660
but lighting effects. The first thing that struck me for the lighting effects was during a

01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:45.140
thunderstorm and having grown up in thunderstorm central. That is what the sky looks like is very

01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:49.780
accurate. And I was like, Oh, my God, it kind of hit like a little homesickness in me. Oh,

01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:55.460
interesting. But you know, right now you have crazy reds raffle. And he wants to get all the

01:07:55.460 --> 01:08:01.300
money out of you. Five hundred bucks a ticket or bells, I should say. And there are 12 items in it.

01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:06.980
You get a red sparkler, a blue sparkler, a fountain firework, a bubble blower, and Uchiwa fan, which

01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:15.700
is something like this. Which is, yeah, like a Japanese it looks like it. I can't think of a

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:18.900
better way to describe it. I'm sorry. It kind of looks like a ping pong paddle, but it's a fan.

01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:24.020
Yeah, it's fan. I think this one says Matsuri. So there you go.

01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:31.860
I was trying to think of the word. I couldn't think of ping pong paddle, but my brain was going

01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:35.620
in the same place. That's right. I also get a pinwheel, a tweeter, which I guess is like a

01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:41.460
maybe a noise maker thing. Blue balloons, red balloons, yellow balloons, green balloons,

01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:47.780
and pink balloons. And one of the other things, and people are ridiculously excited about this,

01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:52.020
you can trip again. Yeah, I saw this. Yeah, yeah.

01:08:53.700 --> 01:09:04.740
So going back, though, to the data mine. A user named Ninji, who does a lot of data mining,

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:10.340
found a few things from this update. And some of them aren't really like the biggest of surprises,

01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:19.620
because these were referred to before. There is a new gyroid. It's 35 underscore gyroid.

01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:24.500
And the one that I think it is, is the gyroid that appears with Luna. So I don't think that

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:29.540
one's anything different. But it does. It does indicate gyroids might like kind of

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:35.060
make a, because you don't see them a lot in the game. Yeah, they're there when you're building

01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:38.980
a bridge or something. But I feel like they were like, it was such a huge part of the first game

01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:42.740
was collecting them. So it's interesting. That's not there. Kind of just the point that they don't

01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:48.180
have them right now. I bet they show up in a later update. I do. I just don't see that.

01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:52.740
I'm sure that they are. Yeah. You know, and of course, you know, if you know actually what

01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:59.460
they're based off of the Haniwa, they were buried with people. So you're digging up leftover

01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:07.140
burials. I think that's hilarious. There are new item kinds. And it's all starts off with

01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:12.660
VGT, I guess like for vegetable and then has name after it. So we have tomato, wheat, sugar cane,

01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:20.340
potato, carrot, squash, and then map looks like different items in the map. And then any bush for

01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:27.780
a plumeria. The thing that I would have loved to have seen that has been data mined before

01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:36.020
and inferred in a game would be Brewster or Master as he is in Japan. They taught,

01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:43.860
there was a rumor about the roost opening in the museum like it used to be. Although I would love

01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:50.500
to have the full roost cafe. I think that would be lovely. I'd love to have the cafe. Making

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:56.260
drinks for your villagers and whatnot. I think that would be fun, but c'est la vie. We'll find

01:10:56.260 --> 01:11:01.860
out eventually, but it just makes me happy to see so much support and seeing new stuff come out

01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:07.700
every time. I'm delighted. Yeah. I like that they are, you know, cause I've kind of complained on

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:11.700
this show before. Like, all right, things are starting to feel a little stale for me. And it's

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:15.860
like, right when I start to get in that mindset, it's like, Oh, here comes an update. So I mean,

01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:20.580
they are doing really good timing on that. I gotta say it's, it's working. Don't forget about your

01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:29.380
seasonal items, Rob. There are two kimono. Of course, based on, I think based on legend stories

01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:38.660
and then I think a Brazilian rodeo horse. So some pretty neat stuff. Yeah, definitely.

01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:45.620
Look at your seasonal items. The Tanabata thing of course is over. So we have new things. You

01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:49.620
just keep checking up on them. There are some really neat stuff. Now, if you meet things,

01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:55.140
if you guys would mind, please share your dream codes with me, um, over, uh, in the

01:11:55.140 --> 01:12:00.740
vog network discord, I think it'd be a great place to do that. So vog network.com slash discord. I

01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:04.820
don't remember if we have an animal crossing channel. I thought, I think we did, but something

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:08.900
happened, but you can put them in the orange sounds radio channel. That's fine. Um, so please,

01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:16.500
I'll go ahead and pass out my dream code. Oh, please. Yes. Yes. Zero two three seven

01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:23.140
eight seven three seven four eight one six. I'll post it in our chat, but for listeners,

01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:29.460
come check out. That's great. Thank you. I don't have one yet. Um, I haven't put it, uh,

01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:34.660
I haven't put it in, uh, or I haven't put mine on the web yet. I heard there are some problems

01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:40.900
if you advertise your social media on your passport with those dream islands, which to me is

01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:47.700
ridiculous. It's just, it's overreaching by Nintendo, but whatever. I mean, I guess they're

01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:54.500
worried I might have porn on my Twitter or something. Um, so whatever. But, um, so for

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:59.620
that reason, I don't have mine posted on dream yet, but I will probably edit my card. Most people

01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:03.540
that come to visit me know my fricking social media at this point. So it doesn't really do

01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:08.820
me any favors anyway. Um, Facebook group, we have a thread already for dream codes.

01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:15.780
Of course the group is private. So if any listener is friends with me on Facebook or anyone who's in

01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:22.340
that group, um, add, just say that you came, you know, like leave a note that you came from

01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:25.860
listening to the podcast and I'll be sure to add you in, but you break my fricking rules and I

01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:37.140
break your back. Oh my gosh. All right. I've already kicked out some, uh, two people for,

01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:42.580
um, for breaking rules. Uh, well, the thing is that people were like doing,

01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:49.940
one of the rules that I have on there is that you do not, uh, do, uh, sell, um, items for,

01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:55.060
uh, Nook Miles or you don't sell Nook Miles for money, right? Because that's a good way to get

01:13:55.060 --> 01:14:02.420
my channel banned. So I, and I, I, um, I will ban people for selling bootleg items. It hasn't

01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:07.060
stopped me from buying, you know, a few amiibo cards for characters I wanted. Just keep it off

01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:14.180
of, off of the group because that will get my places. Um, and, uh, I will say, so please post

01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:21.300
some dream codes to the OLR channel in discord because I want to do a stream later this week

01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:27.060
where I visit some islands and Jamie's will be one of the first that I will go visit. Uh,

01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:32.100
the more codes we get, the more islands I will go visiting. Uh, my island is kind of hot garbage.

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:36.100
It's really taken over by roses right now cause I'm not very good at pruning them. So they have

01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:41.460
just, yeah, they're, they're practically weeds. They're very colorful weeds. You know what though?

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:47.220
I'm okay with a rainbow explosion a little bit on my island. Uh, but yeah, I don't like running

01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:51.780
around and accidentally picking up like all these flowers that fill my thing and I have to go sell

01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:57.540
them. I get it. I get it. Just irritating. So once I clean my island, I will post a dream code as

01:14:57.540 --> 01:15:02.580
well because I do, I do have some cute things I've done. I have my little Zen garden. It's cute.

01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:07.140
So, all right. Right. I've had a better view by, by the way, the fireworks and actually one of my

01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:13.060
custom ones did show up. So I'll just put it up there while, while we're moving on. All right,

01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:18.340
well let's move on to the next story. So Loki, what do you have for us? Yes. So let's talk a

01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:26.500
little bit about Minecraft again. So you can now play doom inside of Minecraft as well as

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:35.140
I've seen Minecraft played inside of Minecraft as well. Um, some other sort of, so it's this mod

01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:40.660
called a VM computers mod allows you to build your own computer in game. And then I think run like

01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:47.380
a virtual, um, PC. So you can do all sorts of things in there. Um, so of course people have

01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:53.940
played Minecraft in Minecraft and, um, windows 95 and Minecraft and stuff like that. So a pretty

01:15:53.940 --> 01:16:03.540
cool, um, thing that I don't know. It's a little unnecessary, but whatever. Uh, the one I actually

01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:08.340
saw that was kind of funny. There was, um, a mod that someone did that actually this cause this

01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:13.140
is actually kind of like doing an actual screen, but I saw one that actually they took a camera

01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:17.700
feed and like projecting it onto actual blocks. So the blocks are changing to make the screen. So

01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:22.580
it was very low res and someone actually played and beat Minecraft on that as well. But this is,

01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:28.180
this is a little bit more practical as you can actually see and probably be able to utilize,

01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:33.060
um, this versus the other way, but it's, it's a neat mod. I'm guessing if you have the Java

01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:37.700
version of Minecraft, you can go check it out, but, uh, not for me necessarily. Cause I've been

01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:42.340
playing mostly on bedrock, but it's still pretty cool. Um, Minecraft is such a huge game and it

01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:46.180
has a really, um, you know, like a younger following that like your kids are into Minecraft,

01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:50.180
right? Do you think something like this, I mean, I think a lot of us kind of like roll our eyes

01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:53.940
at it. We go, you know, what are they going to put doom on next to toaster? But do you think

01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:58.020
something like this actually kind of like helps a younger audience discover some of these retro

01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:03.220
games through this? I don't think so because you would have already had to have them on your PC in

01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:08.580
the first place. It's not like it's just giving you, like, it's not like, you know, finding a

01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:13.540
retro game and say the, you know, early version of animal crossing or something like that.

01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:19.860
This is more of like, Hey, it's a neat thing. I can play now doom on, on, on Minecraft.

01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:25.860
I could also play doom outside of Minecraft. Um, it's more of like kind of a, just a neat thing.

01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:32.260
Like, Oh, Hey look, I was able to get this to work. Um, is it practical? Probably not.

01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:35.860
I don't know if this would maybe necessarily work in like, say a server or something where

01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:41.700
you could run this and maybe have your friends play stuff. Um, I don't know. It's just, it's,

01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:47.700
I think it's more of a silly thing to do. Now, DJ Rama S points out in chat,

01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:53.540
you can run Linux on a toaster and you can play doom on Linux, but can you run the popular

01:17:53.540 --> 01:18:01.140
screensaver application from the 1990s after dark on Linux, because then you could get toasters on

01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:10.500
your toaster. Yes, you could. For the record, you can run after dark. Um, I think that you can run

01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:18.580
it on any Mac up to Mojave. Um, after dark was the shit, like whatever happened to after dark,

01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:23.540
like, I guess like you can still do it, but the thing is, is that, um, for, uh, Catalina,

01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:33.940
it's only 32 bit applications. So, huh. Ah, all right. Well, let's move on. We have some more news

01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:39.540
and I want to get to talking a little more about halo. Uh, we talked a little earlier in the show

01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:44.500
about halo, but, uh, and, and Loki had talked about the battle royale mode, um, which I am

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:49.060
really jazzed about. And I hope that is something that happens. And I don't usually get into battle

01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:54.020
royale, but I'm like battle royale and halo would be really fun because it's arcade and fast paced,

01:18:54.020 --> 01:19:00.100
which I know Fortnite is very that way as well. But look, I come from a generation that I played

01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:05.380
a lot more halo back in the day, especially the classics one and two. So like a battle royale

01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:08.500
and that would be awesome. You know, it'd be really awesome. It would be a battle royale and

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:12.180
quake. And I'm sure somebody has already made that mod, but are there a hundred people playing it?

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:17.700
I don't know. Anyway, let's talk a little bit about, um, some of the graphics criticism that

01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:21.940
came up, which again, I have to be honest, you know, and I talked about this on last week's show

01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:27.140
and somebody even made a clip of it, which is really funny, but, um, like I, I didn't get the

01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:31.620
criticism to the extent that it's out there. Like people are making it sound like it's a crime and

01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:35.780
I'm like, it didn't look that bad. You guys calm down, but you know, yeah. Okay. There was some

01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:42.020
pop-in and things like that, but obviously 343 industries, they've heard a little bit of that

01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:48.340
feedback as well. So they made a blog post where community manager, John Juniezic, I hope I said

01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:54.020
that right. Sorry. Uh, said that they have quote, heard the feedback, uh, and that the, the build

01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:59.460
used to run the campaign demo was work in progress from several weeks ago with a variety of graphical

01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:04.820
elements and game systems still being finished and polished. So, you know, kind of the typical,

01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:09.780
like it's not done yet, so y'all need to hold on. Um, and then, uh, they also kind of talked about

01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:14.820
how they're going for a classic style. They're getting away from Halo 4 and Halo 5 and Halo

01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:19.380
Wars 2, and they want to go close to the original trilogy, which I think is a good move. And to me,

01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:24.900
the demo really showed that. Um, so there was that. Um, and then they also talked a little

01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:29.620
bit about the pop-in, uh, and this has to do a little bit with the dynamic lighting they're

01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:34.260
saying, which is a little bit more technically ambitious than static lighting. Uh, and because

01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:39.060
the campaign demo took place in like a valley where the sun wasn't really reaching it, and so

01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:45.380
there isn't as much light, it looked a little drab. So that's kind of interesting. Uh, 343 actually

01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:49.940
said they watched one of the criticism videos about this and said they agree with the assessments

01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:55.860
and saying, we do have work to do to address some of these areas and raise the level of fidelity

01:20:55.860 --> 01:21:00.740
and overall presentation for the final game. We don't have firm answers or outcomes to share yet,

01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:04.900
but the team is working as quickly as possible on plans to address some of the feedback around

01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:11.700
detail, clarity, and overall fidelity. Um, again, I'm still excited to play the game. I,

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:16.340
I'm not scared off by some of the stuff they've been talking about. Um, I'm kind of jazzed that

01:21:16.340 --> 01:21:20.340
they're going for a more classic feel. The fact that they're injecting a modern battle

01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:26.020
royale into it. I haven't been this excited for a Halo game since probably number four.

01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:32.020
Um, it's, it's been a while, so, um, I'm excited. So we'll check it out. Um,

01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:37.220
let me ask a quick question though of chat and my co-hosts, because obviously we live in the

01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:43.380
day and age of instant, instant feedback. Thanks to Twitter. We, we love instant feedback. Thanks

01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:47.300
to our chat room. That's part of, that's been the backbone of the show for the years that we've

01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:52.340
been doing it, but you know, an independent podcast and a large video game developer,

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:58.740
two very, very, very different types of audiences. Um, in this day and age of that online criticism,

01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:06.580
is this helping games development? Did this feedback help Halo Infinite or is this holding

01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:12.820
it back? What do you guys think? Any feedback is good. I think as long as it's constructive.

01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:17.700
Right. Constructive is a very important term because certainly we've seen the bullshit,

01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:23.940
like death threats, harassment, uh, racist, sexist, you name it type of language.

01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:30.660
And we can all agree that's all bullshit and does nothing, but constructive feedback. Um,

01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:36.260
yeah, I think constructive feedback that you're hearing a lot of it in this, that that's kind of

01:22:36.260 --> 01:22:39.540
the message they're receiving from it. What do you think? What do you think, Logie?

01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:46.900
Um, I don't know. I mean, I think any feedback's good. So at least they know if they're on the

01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:52.500
right track or not. Um, I'm just curious to see what they do with it. I mean, obviously

01:22:53.140 --> 01:23:00.100
gameplay has been pretty much a focus of them, so I'm excited. I didn't play a lot of, uh,

01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:05.140
Halo. I mean, I've kind of gotten to it like Halo three, but I never really played much aside from

01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:10.820
like going to a friend's house and playing some multiplayer of, uh, one or two. But yeah, I mean,

01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:17.860
I don't think it's going to be a bad thing. Yeah. Well, we'll see. I'm also kind of like,

01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:21.620
Oh, they don't have a lot of time to really fix things. I mean, if this game's coming up for the

01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:26.260
holidays and they probably already are on an aggressive track to try to get this game finished.

01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:31.780
So I wonder how much of this we're going to see in like, uh, day one patches. I know that'll be

01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:35.460
a big one. There's probably gonna be a big day one patch. It's going to address some of this as

01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:41.540
well. Um, VG realness. Oh, interesting. I love this comment. VG realness says,

01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:47.220
I think the best example of instant feedback, despite its methods and delivery,

01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:52.100
important disclaimer there was the Sonic movie and SSG100 Matt echoes that saying,

01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:57.060
I was thinking that. Yeah. And that was very recent memory when that first Sonic trailer

01:23:57.060 --> 01:24:02.260
came out and most of us responded to that and that original design by saying yikes,

01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:08.980
but they, they heard that loud and clear, went back, reinvented it and the finished product.

01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:12.420
I think at the end of the day, it seemed like a lot. I still haven't seen the movie. I really

01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:19.300
need to, especially since I sit at home all day. Uh, I, I think there that it came out a much

01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:25.460
better product as a result and probably made a ton more money than it would have, whether it was

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:30.020
that that whole controversy created more public awareness or whatever it was. I it's kind of

01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:38.340
interesting to me. So that's very true. Very true. All right. Um, let's move on. We got a

01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:41.540
lot more stories to get to and we're running a little long tonight. So I might, I might

01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:47.460
accelerate on some of these stories, but, uh, dark Sakura. Well, um, something very

01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:52.420
stupid is going to happen. And you know, when I say something as stupid, it's going to be pretty

01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:58.740
stupid. Um, there is going to be the legal legends championship and it's happening in Shanghai.

01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:05.140
Um, even though we're in the middle of a global pandemic, um, riot games announced that it's

01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:10.660
going to take place on September 20th between September 25th at October 21st with the finals

01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:16.500
at the Pudong soccer stadium or football stadium. Um, they are promising safety measures, but

01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:23.300
no, no, no, but Jamie hasn't China beat COVID.

01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:30.660
No, they, they had to, as far as I understand, they had a massive resurgence again.

01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:39.060
So no, now they said that they're going to be, um, you know, having like abilities for virtual

01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:45.460
fans, but it's, it doesn't, first of all, there's the risks in travel. There's the risks in staying

01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:50.100
at hotels. There's risks in restaurants. There's a risk of being around that many people and

01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:55.860
fuck them. You know, and somebody posted a story in discord. That's kind of tangential

01:25:55.860 --> 01:26:00.260
to this whole thing. It was about a call of duty competition and, and sorry, I don't have discord

01:26:00.260 --> 01:26:04.420
up in front of me right now. Yeah. But like, there's like, one of them was supposed to be

01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:10.260
a virtual event, but they like went rogue and did it anyway in person. And Oh my God, like,

01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:14.260
you know, and I think everybody that was in discord kind of had the same reaction I did

01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:18.900
where it was like, what the fuck are they thinking? Like I, it, they weren't, it blows

01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:26.180
my mind that people don't take this seriously. Like I, I, I very much like when it comes to

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:31.300
politics, when it comes to should pineapple be on pizza or not, I try very hard to put myself

01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:35.620
in somebody else's shoes and see things from their perspective. This is one of those things.

01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:42.980
I can't do it. Like, I don't understand why people are so insistent on this whole thing being made

01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:47.460
up or fake, especially when like, you know, and I, y'all know I went off a couple of weeks ago

01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:51.940
because I knew somebody that was affected by this, but now we're, we're hearing celebrities,

01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:59.940
politicians. Hello. We thought that my mom had it, you know, and you know how frightened I was.

01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:05.380
Yeah. You know, my, my little brother had it and may actually still have it. And then of course,

01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:12.260
there's all the long-term, uh, detriments now, um, permanent lung damage, um, uh, bringing on

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:20.580
other symptoms, uh, people developing fibromyalgia, for example. I mean, it's, it's bad. It's really

01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:24.980
bad. And you know, people like, Oh, it's a political, no, it's not a political thing.

01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:30.820
It's a human thing. Okay. We just, and I was even telling one of my, one of my friends from

01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:36.100
my synagogue, she's like, so if you go out traveling, do you do the, the two weeks social

01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:39.220
distancing when you get home? And I was like, well, first of all, I don't go out traveling,

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:42.900
but if I did damn right, I would be staying at home because I actually give a shit about other

01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:47.940
people, you know? Well, I think I put it that way. I think what actually what I said is that

01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:53.540
not distancing is selfish. It means you don't care about other people. It's not a political

01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:59.140
thing at all. And as I was really dismayed, I went to, um, my sister meeting today, um,

01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:02.740
cause they were going to do like a big makeup tutorial and I thought, Oh, it's all going to

01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:07.940
be, you know, upper face and people are going to be wearing, no one was wearing a mask except me.

01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:14.900
And so I stayed as much of a six foot distance from other people as I could. I kept my mask on.

01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:21.460
There was no way I was going to expose myself and you know, I ended up just leaving. I mean,

01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:28.900
and I love my sisters, don't get me wrong, but I'm, I'm just not comfortable around it. And then,

01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:36.180
you know, I'm not trying to make this about, about me, but I'm also immunocompromised.

01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:40.660
Yeah. So, and especially since I have that pneumonia, my lungs are already,

01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:44.180
I'm still on asthma medication. There's a chance it could have been COVID,

01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:50.340
but I couldn't get a test. And so now for people like me who thought they,

01:28:50.340 --> 01:28:55.780
who might've had it and couldn't get tested, we're living in this sort of Schrodinger's virus

01:28:55.780 --> 01:29:00.660
state, you know, and, and then, you know, they're also now saying that even if you had it,

01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:07.380
the antibodies aren't lasting. I just, I, every day I just hope, and I, I don't, I don't know if

01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:13.700
I like to say pray, but I just, I wish very badly, um, that there's some good news on this front with

01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:17.300
the multiple vaccines that are happening because with every day that goes by, I keep thinking

01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:22.660
other people are going to get me killed. You know what I hope? I hope that, um,

01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:27.940
I mean, you know, they're already talking about the pharmaceutical companies are really wanting

01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:35.380
to gouge, uh, prices for, uh, for these things. And I think it's absolutely disgusting. Um,

01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:40.900
but I am hoping that when we have the vaccines that they're going to be made available to

01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:43.220
everybody. I really do. Same.

01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:50.180
Um, and I mean, and I'm going to just say one more thing about it. You know, as a student of history,

01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:55.860
all you have to do is look to the past. All you have to do is look to the past and see,

01:29:56.500 --> 01:30:03.860
you know, for example, when the, um, when the Spanish flu was a thing, they had this whole

01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:10.820
drama where, um, people didn't want to wear their masks and there were people lobby. And just like

01:30:10.820 --> 01:30:18.980
we see today, and you saw the second surge of, um, of Spanish influenza killed bright people.

01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:26.260
One of my favorite artists, um, egg on Shayla died of Spanish influenza. Um, his, uh, I don't

01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:30.500
know if they were married, but his lady was pregnant and he did a painting called the family

01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:37.620
that was her and him and their, their fetus as a child. And she died right after that painting.

01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:43.860
And he died right after her and that knowing that that's actually the thing that's been really

01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:50.820
driving this home for me is to look at such a genius artist and think there are other

01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:57.300
genius artists now who are dying from this plague. Yeah. So, okay. I didn't mean to go on a tirade,

01:30:57.300 --> 01:31:03.780
but maybe it isn't directly about video games, but it's on everybody's mind. So, you know,

01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:07.460
and this is a place for that type of stuff sometimes. So anyway, let's, you know, we'll

01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:13.380
just keep our fingers and toes crossed that, um, we just, Hey, at least I know I'm taking all the

01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:19.700
precautions best I can. Um, but I can't control other people. That's all we can do. All right,

01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:24.580
let's move on. Let's, let's talk about, let's talk about somewhat happier news and talk about

01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:28.660
an old game. Still going all the, a game that's been going as long as this show.

01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:34.980
Yeah. What's my remake coming out? I mean, seriously. So final fantasy 11, the game that I

01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:41.540
like spent so many years playing and, um, they're announcing that they're getting yet another update

01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:45.380
to it. You might think, geez, you know, are they done with that game yet? No, apparently not.

01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:50.660
So they're doing a brand new update. That's going to add a whole new storyline to the game as well.

01:31:50.660 --> 01:31:54.260
Apparently it's going to be more end game content. So you have to play through the last update that

01:31:54.260 --> 01:32:00.580
they had. And, um, yeah, I mean, it looks like there's some other enhancements being done to the

01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:05.860
beast master class, but that's pretty exciting. They're still doing updates for that game.

01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:12.660
When's the port or remake coming out? Yeah. That mobile port discussion really disappeared

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:16.100
in the last, what's just feels like it's been like five years since they showed that off.

01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:22.740
I mean, honestly, it's not going to be siphoning that many. I don't think anyone's going to be

01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:27.860
leaving final fantasy 14 to play it. Yeah. It would be nice to have it like updated.

01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:32.500
Or charge one subscription fee for multiple games would probably still rake in, you know,

01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:37.780
decent amount of money. Why not? It works for game pass. Right. So there is that. So, um,

01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:43.140
I have you, have you ever been tempted to go back and check it out all these years later, Loki?

01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:49.380
I remember I played a little bit on a pirate server a while back and that was okay,

01:32:49.380 --> 01:32:53.300
but it was really empty. It would be better if I had friends playing it because

01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:59.620
I did like how fast they had really like boosted the percentage of, uh, XP that you would get.

01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:05.300
So the rates were really fast. So you could solo yourself pretty fast through that game. Um,

01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:11.460
but it still was like really barren and there was like no one there and going back to it after so

01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:17.460
long, not playing it. Um, I didn't remember what to do for most of them. Like, I don't remember

01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:26.260
where I had to level up here. So it was a little difficult there, but, um, I do like the fast

01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:30.260
progression through that and it would be nice to be able to play some of the other expansions that

01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:35.620
way. Cause, um, it was a real bear to have to like, you know, search for parties and stuff

01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:42.260
too. And the level caps thing was also annoying. Um, it was terrible being a white mage. Yeah.

01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:49.620
So like, um, I would like to go back and try it again, but like, I don't know. I'd have a hard

01:33:49.620 --> 01:33:59.300
time justifying pain 12 bucks a month. Yeah. All right. Uh, let's move on, um, and talk about

01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:03.860
something, uh, a little newer, uh, but coming to a new console, this was pretty quick, but, um,

01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:10.100
this week cuphead released on the PlayStation four. Um, and this, this game of course was already

01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:16.900
out on, uh, uh, Microsoft, uh, areas like, uh, windows 10 and, um, Xbox. Uh, and then, uh, it

01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:23.860
was out on switch a few months ago. Um, but now it's out on PlayStation four, um, and they came

01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:27.060
out this week. There were some, there were some leaks and things leading up to it, like, uh,

01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:30.900
another store in another country had to add some artwork up. So people kind of knew it was coming,

01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:35.700
but, uh, it was confirmed in an official PlayStation blog post that hello, it's here today.

01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:39.700
And obviously if you haven't played the game yet, it's a, it's got amazing art direction in the

01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:45.380
game. It's, it's really a stunner, um, in that regard. Um, but it is kind of also interesting

01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:50.500
because, you know, studio MDHR, uh, kind of had a partnership with Microsoft going on.

01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:55.700
So is it kind of weird to see this on it, but it isn't, I don't know if the Microsoft logo shows

01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:59.220
up on the boot of the game or something like that, or if there was some type of like other

01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:03.620
agreement there, but it's just, it's interesting to me that these Microsoft things, like it made

01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:07.620
once it made some sense on Nintendo, but it's really weird when you see it on PlayStation,

01:35:07.620 --> 01:35:12.660
like Minecraft. Right. But of course, as you guys know, that predates the Microsoft, um,

01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:18.660
acquisition there, uh, why Minecraft is on PlayStation and Nintendo systems.

01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:25.300
It's kind of interesting, you know, um, they also made a brand new animated short,

01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:30.180
uh, which is like a stop motion. Uh, and you can check that out on the official PlayStation blog,

01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:34.420
but yeah, if you haven't played Cuphead yet, uh, definitely take a moment to, uh, check it out.

01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:38.580
It's a great game. All right. Aren't they doing like a cartoon series as well? I swear,

01:35:39.060 --> 01:35:45.700
I saw something like that too. Yeah. Like again, this vape, this huge, massive video game, uh,

01:35:45.700 --> 01:35:51.220
on streaming services, uh, barrage of stuff. Yeah. I feel like Cuphead, something we've seen in that

01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:55.860
too. I get sounds like something that would be a Netflix thing as well. Yeah. Did you remember

01:35:55.860 --> 01:36:01.620
S and chatter both saying cup had the cuphead show on Netflix. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Was it on now

01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:06.740
or is it coming out, uh, in development? Yeah. It's probably one of those things that's going

01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:10.020
to be held up a little bit by what's going on in the world. Although animation can probably

01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:15.380
done a little, a little easier, uh, at home than, uh, the live shot stuff. But anyway.

01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:21.380
Oh, absolutely. Well, let's take a trip down memory lane. Uh, and let's go to a time when,

01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:25.540
uh, we didn't have Netflix to get series for shows. You had the super Mario brothers super

01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:30.020
show, and that was it. It's the classic game of the week. And every week here on the program,

01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:35.380
dark soccer steps into the gaming vault to find a game that she thinks, Hey, you brat should be

01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:39.860
checking this out. Um, but once a month dark soccer likes to mix it up and you know what

01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:45.060
pinball are video games too. Kinda. They're just very different. Uh, so, uh, it's time

01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:50.900
for the classic pinball of the month. Dark soccer. What did you pick for the, um, classic

01:36:50.900 --> 01:37:01.380
pinball of the month? That your hint? Yes. I think it's a good one. Let me put up some of the

01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:08.020
footage too. Um, Indiana Jones, the pinball adventure, not to be confused with the 2008,

01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:13.940
uh, Indiana Jones game that Stern did. So, and also on top, sorry, I quickly want to point out,

01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:19.060
I'm using a video cause this doesn't exist in the, um, FX games and all that. So, um,

01:37:19.060 --> 01:37:22.900
this pinball table may be a little click clacky in the background. If the noise is too much,

01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:26.020
let me know and I'll turn it off. You guys can see the table well enough right now.

01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:31.940
Okay. Well, I don't hear anything. Yeah. You and Loki won't, but the listeners will.

01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:39.140
At any rate. Um, this one was one of, uh, it was by, uh, Midway Williams. Um, and it was one of

01:37:39.140 --> 01:37:45.700
their super pin series, which is a wide body table. Um, and it was the first pinball game to

01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:52.340
ever use the Williams DS, uh, sorry, DCS sound system. Um, and it had, um, I mean,

01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:58.660
some of the amazing stuff with a lot of effort went into this one. Um, the game itself came out

01:37:58.660 --> 01:38:06.260
in 1993. Um, and it was, uh, uh, designed by Mark Ritchie, who is the younger brother of Steve

01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:13.780
Ritchie. And we all know, I love Steve. Steve's a cool guy. Um, but, uh, and apparently he's still

01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:19.700
doing voices for the pinballs. Cause I hear his voice all the time now on AC DC, um, of the other

01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:25.060
super pin series. Um, for example, one was Twilight zone, which is another one I have in

01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:30.180
star Trek, the next generation, which is another one I have. Um, we, and yes, we do have Indiana

01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:37.860
Jones right now. And it was also, um, uh, a game that included clips from the first three of the

01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:44.740
films with, uh, John Rice Davies, um, re re uh, pricing his role as Salah for new, uh, for new

01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:50.580
speech in the game. Um, so it's got a different, uh, a few different features. There's actually

01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:58.020
a long shaped mini play field for a roll down game. Um, you have to steer the ball by tilting

01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:04.020
the mini play field left and right. It's called path of adventure. Um, other modes in the game.

01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:13.940
Um, let me get those pulled up real quick. Um, we have, uh, gosh, I lost the mode list. Oh, well,

01:39:13.940 --> 01:39:18.260
that's fine. Cause you know, you still gotta play the game for yourself. Now this particular game

01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:22.980
also has, Oh yeah, there it is. We have get the idol where you have to, uh, get the idol by

01:39:22.980 --> 01:39:26.740
shooting a lock sink hole. You have the Raven bar, get the medallions. So these are all for the

01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:32.100
Raiders. The lost dark ones. You have the streets of Cairo, the well of souls, which is a six ball

01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:38.260
multi-ball, um, with a lock hole. That's worth 2 million points multiplied by the number of balls

01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:43.700
and play balls. Um, you have Indiana Jones and the temple of doom. So you get monkey brains,

01:39:44.340 --> 01:39:49.700
uh, steal the stones escape in the minecart, which is a video mode. Um, video modes kind

01:39:49.700 --> 01:39:54.740
of irritate me, but this one's pretty fun. Um, you have also survived the rope bridge,

01:39:54.740 --> 01:40:00.580
um, which, which, uh, it's a successive ramp shot one. Um, and you score 10 million each. Um,

01:40:00.580 --> 01:40:06.580
and then Indiana Jones and the last crusade, um, you have the castle, but they misspelled it as

01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:13.940
Grunewald. So, um, Yay for that. Um, it was a drop target. You have take chase. Um,

01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:18.740
you have three challenges and then the choose wisely, which is another video mode where

01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:23.060
basically you're choosing your grail. I mean, sorry, it's not a spoiler to say that you got

01:40:23.060 --> 01:40:29.860
to get the Holy grail at the end of the damn movie. Um, and then, um, you'll get, uh, you'll

01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:35.220
get like different animations. So if you, if you choose the right grail, you get the night saying

01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:39.620
you have chosen wisely and get 20 million points. If you choose the wrong rail, you'll see the

01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:45.380
animation of the Nazi dying in the night. We'll say you have chosen poorly with the face melting

01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:52.100
and all that. The face melting was in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Cool. This is last crusade.

01:40:52.100 --> 01:40:58.740
Oh, so it's the Nazi dying. Um, and you get five million points. Um, for your multi balls,

01:40:58.740 --> 01:41:03.140
of course there's the regular multi ball, um, which, which is, uh, for three drop targets that

01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:06.500
cover a hole and then you shoot, lock the hole, you know, et cetera. You have quick multi ball,

01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:12.420
which is a two ball multi, um, with different modes. You have the fish of tails, you have the

01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:19.220
cross of Coronado, the remains of your hockey, the diamond of Shanghai and the idol of the Incas.

01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:23.140
You have the well of souls, which is the six ball multi ball, and then the eternal life,

01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:30.260
which is another six ball by completing all 12, uh, uh, modes that like start modes is

01:41:30.260 --> 01:41:36.980
basically your, uh, your wizard mode. Um, and on top of that, so there is another

01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:43.220
fun thing about this game. Rob, do you know what that is? No, because I actually haven't played

01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:53.380
this table ever. Um, I'll give you a hint. Uh, Trader Sam's, uh, alcoholic beverages.

01:41:54.340 --> 01:42:00.660
No, I tried. This is a table that had the distinction of being at Disneyland

01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:12.020
in a custom, uh, a custom, uh, cabinet. Um, and there are plenty of people who have, uh,

01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:18.500
recreated the Disneyland, uh, cabinet, uh, with its custom side art. And I mean,

01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:22.500
you remember this one, right? It was in trader Sam's. If you went all the way over to the left

01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:27.540
side of the building and it was tucked away, it had the custom artwork and everything. It

01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:32.820
was really cool. Um, I was blown away. We even got into trader Sam's that one time we went,

01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:37.300
we had to wait outside for like an hour. Um, so I don't remember seeing the whole machine.

01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:42.900
I was just excited to have a fruity alcoholic beverages. No, no, no trader Sam's across from

01:42:42.900 --> 01:42:48.820
the Indiana Jones ride. No alcoholic beverages there. Why am I thinking of the place at the

01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:54.660
Disneyland hotel? I don't know why that's where my brain went. My bad. Do you know what I'm talking

01:42:54.660 --> 01:43:03.620
about? That bar too many Disney places. Sorry. Okay. Okay. I do vaguely remember that now.

01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:10.180
Okay. You're right. They did have a pinball table there. Yeah. It's it's really, um, you know,

01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:14.340
and I thought it was great that they even went so far to have one with the custom cabinet and

01:43:14.340 --> 01:43:22.740
everything. Um, I'm trying to see if I can find it. Um, uh, Jones pinball. Cause yeah,

01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:29.060
they did some crazy stuff to it and yeah, there's a, uh, video of people playing it. Okay. So I've

01:43:29.060 --> 01:43:33.300
got the picture now. Sorry, uh, people at home, you're just going to have to Google it yourself,

01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:41.700
but I'm posting something in chat and Rob, when you see it, it'll instantly look familiar. Um,

01:43:41.700 --> 01:43:46.660
but yeah, they ended up taking it out when they restructured, um, more of trader Sam's to expand

01:43:46.660 --> 01:43:53.220
it for other items. So, um, and then you can also find other people's, uh, custom. Yeah. I,

01:43:53.220 --> 01:44:00.420
I remember that store. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, but it's honestly enough. Um, just,

01:44:01.780 --> 01:44:07.780
again, it was a super nice touch. Um, and of course, lots of people being fans of it have

01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:14.980
since, um, recreated it. And so, uh, a lot of times you'll find this modifications that people

01:44:14.980 --> 01:44:22.180
have in their own homes. By the way, dark soccer, I have good news. I'm not crazy. The place I was

01:44:22.180 --> 01:44:29.540
thinking of was also called trader Sam's enchanted Tiki bar. Ah, Sam talking, or maybe it's just

01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:34.340
called the trading post. Yeah, maybe, maybe you're crazy. No, it's fine. It's like, there's a lot of

01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:40.580
places because they, you know, on the jungle cruise and actually, yeah, it's across from

01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:45.380
the jungle cruise and Indiana Jones. Right. It's just a little bit further past. Yeah. But, um,

01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:50.660
but yeah, I mean, I was even telling Dan, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be full of hate if we did

01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:56.020
our table like that. Cause it's really freaking cool. Um, and on top of that, the wood thing,

01:44:56.020 --> 01:45:00.740
one of the things I liked about having that wood rim on it, I have a bad habit of getting little

01:45:00.740 --> 01:45:07.940
like lines on my wrist from hitting the metal guard, uh, on the top of the table. Um, and

01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:13.460
this, you know, I have like a little tilt sometimes that I'll do where I actually shake

01:45:13.460 --> 01:45:18.340
the top of the table. And so, uh, this was easier to do, not like a tilt, but, you know,

01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:25.220
just like nudging the machine. You don't want to tilt and Siri answered me for some reason.

01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:31.140
But yeah, so anyway, that's, that's your game. Um, it is, uh, Indiana Jones,

01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:37.940
the pinball adventure. Oh, and one other thing about it. Your, uh, your, uh, trigger is actually

01:45:37.940 --> 01:45:45.540
a gun. That's not the only people game to do that though. If I'm not mistaken, I think, uh,

01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:51.380
judge dread does it. And I think that star Trek is a phaser, but Dan had it for the longest time.

01:45:51.380 --> 01:45:54.820
And like, this is going to make sense to nobody, but people who have been in my house.

01:45:54.900 --> 01:46:00.740
Um, where, cause we have, uh, pinballs in the dining room and he had it on the most

01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:07.220
outmost edge. So I would walk by it, go into the kitchen. And if I was a little bit sleepy,

01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:15.300
I would hit my thigh on that damn gun. And I'm just going to tell y'all that hurts. That hurts.

01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:20.820
It hurts. Not good. Um, quick question from SSG100 Matt. And as we kind of come back,

01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:24.500
I'll, I'll turn off the pinball table. Oops. I need the shot that has my co-host on it. There

01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:29.060
we go. Um, as we come back to the show here, um, as you want her to Matt asked this question,

01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:36.260
a serious question, what is an effective pro tip way to nudge a table? Um, so actually there are

01:46:36.260 --> 01:46:39.700
a bunch of channels out there that teach you the secret skills, like how to nudge. There's

01:46:40.340 --> 01:46:45.780
an article about it on pin side, um, which, uh, I would be, uh, more than happy to link. Cause

01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:51.140
there's some video in there. I'll put that in chat right now. Um, but I've seen people do it

01:46:51.140 --> 01:46:55.620
different ways. You know, some people just use their upper body strength and shake the table.

01:46:56.260 --> 01:47:03.860
Um, now me, I use my knees. I also don't really get a lot of motion out of it. I'm not really

01:47:03.860 --> 01:47:09.780
someone to play for nudging, but, um, I would always do it on a couple of tables that drifted.

01:47:10.340 --> 01:47:14.660
So it would just be to knock the ball back into play when it was about to drain or went down the

01:47:14.660 --> 01:47:21.060
wrong area. Um, I would sometimes use it on, um, Twilight zone for the MA and a black Knight for

01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:26.260
the Magna save. Cause you catch it in the Magna save. And if you start the tilt right when not

01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:30.820
the tilt, but the nudge right when, um, you're releasing from the Magna save, you can get it

01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:37.220
further back into play. Um, I, I I'm one that I use my knees. I dodged the side of it with my,

01:47:37.220 --> 01:47:43.940
you know, with my Chinle power thighs. Um, yeah. Yeah. Uh, some, some guys will just,

01:47:43.940 --> 01:47:50.020
we'll do a full on shake. Dan's a shaker. Wow. Um, another one that I like to do, I was talking

01:47:50.020 --> 01:47:56.340
about, so, um, I will, depending on what flipper side that I need, I'll use the opposite hand,

01:47:56.340 --> 01:48:03.460
put it on top of the table and give it a shove. So yeah. Um, that's actually 100 masses. There's

01:48:03.460 --> 01:48:08.820
people who quickly slap, slap the side of tables. I'm a slapper. I'm definitely a slapper for me.

01:48:09.940 --> 01:48:15.300
I listen here, you dumb machine, but you know, I have problems with my wrist,

01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:25.140
so I'll hurt myself doing that. So I actually just use my inner knee. I will shake it by knocking

01:48:25.140 --> 01:48:32.420
the legs or the corner edge with my knees. So I do the, the Chinle power thighs. All right.

01:48:33.060 --> 01:48:37.460
Well, there you go. Your classic pinball table of the month, Indiana Jones as seen it doesn't

01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:43.940
have a little bit. All right, let's move on. Let's get to some rapid fire news. We're going to

01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:47.780
quickly go through some other news here. And by the way, as I don't think I mentioned it towards

01:48:47.780 --> 01:48:51.460
the top of the show, I think you did say it dark soccer, but just to make sure everybody knows

01:48:51.460 --> 01:48:56.500
dark Sakura, thanks to some changes, um, in her day job and schedule and stuff will no longer be

01:48:56.500 --> 01:49:01.060
departing the show at the halfway point regularly. I mean, there are unexpected things will come up,

01:49:01.060 --> 01:49:06.740
but, uh, we're going to have her all night. Yay. All right. Um, for the foreseeable future,

01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:10.580
at least for the next six months, unless my schedule changes again. So I'm super,

01:49:10.580 --> 01:49:14.340
super happy about it. That's always good news. All right. That's the closing shift.

01:49:14.980 --> 01:49:22.820
Let's get into some rapid fire news. Loki. So, um, there's more stuff coming to Netflix,

01:49:22.820 --> 01:49:28.420
more view game adaptations. So the first one that was announced was beyond good and evil is going

01:49:28.420 --> 01:49:35.620
to be getting a movie, um, coming to Netflix. And that's currently in development right now. Um,

01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:40.820
by, I guess, I don't know who necessarily working on it right now. Uh, let's see here. Oh, I'm

01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:46.580
sorry. It's being held by the guys that did, uh, detective Pikachu. So director Rob Letterman and

01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:55.060
produced, I guess, by Ubisoft, Jason Allman and, or Altman and Margaret Boykin. So pretty cool.

01:49:56.020 --> 01:49:58.740
I'm curious if that's going to come up before the sequel does or not.

01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:04.820
So we'll have to wait and see. Um, the other thing too is, uh, not only is that Ubisoft property

01:50:04.820 --> 01:50:12.500
getting a Netflix, um, adaptation, but we're also going to get an anime series for splinter cell.

01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:19.860
That's also coming to Netflix as well. So that's going to be, um, gain 16 episodes over two seasons

01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:26.980
and it's being written by Derek Kolstad, who was the writer for John wick.

01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:34.180
And he's also going to be the executive producer for the show as well. That's pretty cool. Um,

01:50:35.300 --> 01:50:40.500
yeah, I'm surprised lots of good video game adaptation stuff coming to streaming services.

01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:46.580
So looking forward to this. All right. And then, uh, let's talk a little bit about some

01:50:46.580 --> 01:50:51.060
free games that we're going to be getting this month or free with subscription service,

01:50:51.060 --> 01:50:55.220
I should say. So on the PlayStation plus side of things, we're getting fall guys,

01:50:55.940 --> 01:51:00.980
um, ultimate knockout, which looks pretty cool. And call of duty modern warfare two,

01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:06.420
uh, the campaign remastered is going to be coming as well. And that's going to be available on August

01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:12.820
4th through the 31st. And I guess call of duty is going to be a July 20 or a call of duty should

01:51:12.820 --> 01:51:19.300
be available July 28th through August 31st. So it's already available now. Um, and then from the

01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:25.700
Xbox live gold side, we've got portal nights and override mech city brawl. Those are going to be

01:51:25.700 --> 01:51:32.900
coming out for Xbox one and then the Xbox three 60 compatible games, MX unleashed and red faction two.

01:51:35.300 --> 01:51:41.620
That's it. All right. Let's move on and talk about, sorry, I'm also typing in chat multitasking

01:51:41.620 --> 01:51:46.900
because, uh, the idea got brought up for a drag race pinball table and I'm all about that.

01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:51.620
All right. Anyway, that's what I want. All right. Uh, but I want it to be based off

01:51:51.620 --> 01:51:56.100
of Canada's drag race, which I am now convinced is going to be the superior version of the show.

01:51:56.100 --> 01:52:03.380
Uh, but I haven't watched it yet. They changed it up a little bit. There's no singular host.

01:52:03.380 --> 01:52:08.500
It's a panel. So it's, um, uh, Brooklyn Heights, Jeffrey Boyer Chapman and Stacy.

01:52:09.460 --> 01:52:15.140
And I can't remember her name. She's a very famous model, um, in Canada and she has a very distinct

01:52:15.140 --> 01:52:20.260
look. She was in the fifth element. Um, and so they're all, they're all the judges and they're,

01:52:20.260 --> 01:52:25.620
they, they kind of share it. They do everything. Um, and then what they do is that the guest host

01:52:25.620 --> 01:52:31.300
every week, uh, or the guest on the palace does the RuPaul part. So they, they're the,

01:52:31.300 --> 01:52:35.220
the guest is the one that comes out and says, welcome to the main stage. How's everybody doing?

01:52:35.460 --> 01:52:40.660
So it's kind of neat. They kind of put a twist on it. So check it out. All right.

01:52:40.660 --> 01:52:45.060
We do have emails tonight. So we, we do have the obligation to spare drag race talk. Sorry.

01:52:45.060 --> 01:52:52.180
Uh, all right. Let's get into some other rapid fire news. And that is, um, an unfortunate follow

01:52:52.180 --> 01:52:56.900
up to something we talked about a few weeks ago, and it is the dangers of talking about rumors and

01:52:56.900 --> 01:53:02.580
weird things here, uh, as it turns out. So we had talked about that there was a F zero Twitter

01:53:02.580 --> 01:53:06.260
account that showed up. And I think some of us were kind of taking the fact that it was F zero

01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:11.860
with a great assault anyway, but it was that super Mario 35th anniversary one that was like, well,

01:53:11.860 --> 01:53:17.300
maybe there's something a little more here. And it turns out they were both fake and the F zero JP

01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:22.660
account basically started shit posting. And as much as we wanted to believe, it just wasn't

01:53:22.660 --> 01:53:27.700
true. So, you know, sometimes the rumors are right. Sometimes the rumors are wrong and that

01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:32.820
one was wrong. Um, although it doesn't mean that an F zero will never happen again. Just saying,

01:53:32.820 --> 01:53:37.780
all right, moving on. Uh, something we do know will happen. This is not a rumor. This is, uh,

01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:44.340
actual official news is that a new DLC character for soul caliber six sets. Suka will be coming

01:53:44.340 --> 01:53:50.980
out on August 4th. That will be coming alongside 2.20 update for the game, which will have a new

01:53:50.980 --> 01:53:56.580
stage as well. And some costume parts that you can use on your own character in the character

01:53:56.580 --> 01:54:01.220
creator section. A soul caliber six, of course, is on all the different consoles as well as,

01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:06.260
I don't know if it's on switch, uh, but it's also on a PC as well. Uh, and, uh,

01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:12.020
Xbox game pass most notably. So I know that's where I have it right now. Um, but if I wanted

01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:16.500
to get this off to pay a little extra money for it, cause DLC, but it is still a supporting

01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:22.660
soul caliber series, which is a great fighting game series all these days later, uh, dark soccer.

01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:29.380
How about you? Oh, we've got some stuff. Um, uh, another game that's a staple in my house

01:54:29.380 --> 01:54:36.580
is bloodstained curse of the moon too. Um, and there is update 1.3.0. That's available as a

01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:41.860
legend style where your enemies respond from off screen and one character dying counts as

01:54:41.860 --> 01:54:47.700
all the characters dying. It's really difficult. They've done some bug fixes and some other things,

01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:54.500
but yeah, so basically you're getting like hardcore mode. Yay. Um, and then also, uh,

01:54:54.500 --> 01:54:59.860
they finally have a release date trailer out for battle toes. Like, didn't they bring that up like

01:54:59.860 --> 01:55:08.100
in 2018? Um, but yeah, finally, um, yeah, it was E3 2018 on the Microsoft announced it and it was

01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:12.900
supposed to be released last year, but it wasn't. So now we're going to be getting it.

01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:18.980
So it's, it's weird that it's just suddenly like, Oh, by the way, it's finally coming out.

01:55:18.980 --> 01:55:24.660
It's just like, Oh, okay. Uh, this is next month and okay. So yeah,

01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:31.940
this was posted in August, so it's going to be September. So, and via steam and Xbox one.

01:55:32.820 --> 01:55:38.900
Um, and SSG 100, Matt points out, you can call the evil G and ask when battle toads is coming out.

01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:43.940
And now they'll give you a real answer. It actually is still August. Uh, I don't

01:55:43.940 --> 01:55:48.340
know why they said next month. It's August 20th. All right, cool. So yeah, there you go.

01:55:49.380 --> 01:55:54.660
All right. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates starting in the

01:55:54.660 --> 01:56:00.980
U S Loki. Well, as I mentioned earlier during, um, the games are remaining free on PlayStation

01:56:00.980 --> 01:56:05.860
four fall guys, ultimate knockout is going to be coming out on PlayStation four as well as PC as

01:56:05.860 --> 01:56:12.580
well. Um, then of course, we're also going to be getting fast and the furious crossroads on PC,

01:56:12.580 --> 01:56:19.220
PlayStation four and Xbox one and horizon zero Dawn on PC. That's it.

01:56:20.180 --> 01:56:25.300
That's a, that's a big one for a PC. Uh, I know desk stranding came out not that long ago,

01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:28.660
and I do have some Twitter friends that are playing it for the first time. Thanks to that.

01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:34.020
So it's kind of interesting seeing the reactions, um, to that, like, like the game is new in a way.

01:56:34.580 --> 01:56:39.620
Um, let's talk about some Japanese release dates coming to the Nintendo switch in Japan,

01:56:39.620 --> 01:56:44.100
the coma double cut. That's the name of the game. Uh, it's coming out on the switch

01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:50.260
monster boy and the cursed kingdom makes its Japanese debut on August 6th and a La

01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:54.820
Mulana collection. That's right. A physical edition of one and two in a limited edition

01:56:54.820 --> 01:57:01.620
is also out this week in Japan somewhere. I hear dark Tetsuya going yay. Um, so, cause I know he's

01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:07.620
a big La Mulana fan, uh, looking at the PlayStation four and the releases over there. Um,

01:57:08.420 --> 01:57:12.500
well, this is awkward. My computer froze up, so I can't look at them right now until it recovers

01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:17.940
here. Uh, live technical difficulties. Okay. It's, it's freed up again, but now I'm on the

01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:26.020
wrong part of the page. Um, but I like to do switch and PlayStation four. No, I got it. It

01:57:26.020 --> 01:57:31.220
just fixed itself just in time. Uh, we have a watchdogs one and two double pack in Japan.

01:57:31.220 --> 01:57:35.860
We have a far cry for our cry three and four double pack. We also have the monster boy and

01:57:35.860 --> 01:57:40.820
the cursed kingdom edition coming out in Japan on the PS four as well. And then a game called

01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:47.540
VVV tunia. I don't know if that's like a stylized W or something. I do not believe this is at all

01:57:47.540 --> 01:57:52.900
related to the game VVVVV. Although you might think that at first glance, no, this is more of a

01:57:52.900 --> 01:57:58.900
anime based game there, uh, where you play melee and shooter characters and hack and slash battle.

01:57:58.900 --> 01:58:06.180
And yet there is a rhythm thing that you actually team up with virtual you YouTubers and play like

01:58:06.180 --> 01:58:10.500
a rhythm game in it. So I bet there's some of our long time listeners that are into this,

01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:16.340
cause it sounds like it's got some music infused stuff in it there. So, all right. Oh yeah. And

01:58:16.340 --> 01:58:20.580
Dr. Sia says, I've heard of this Bob coffee. It's a Neptune. Yeah. Game. Yep. Okay. So some of you

01:58:20.580 --> 01:58:27.700
know this. All right. All right. Uh, how about Europe? Darzagra? Uh, Scully on the fourth

01:58:28.340 --> 01:58:33.940
for everything. All right. The end. All right. Uh, let's go to the mailbag every week. You guys

01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:39.300
send us emails, participate at orange laundry.com is the place to send us your emails and we will

01:58:39.300 --> 01:58:44.740
read a few of our favorites on the show. Although if my records are correct, we have a one favorite

01:58:44.740 --> 01:58:51.460
email to read tonight. Yes, just one. Hi. Uh, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican act

01:58:51.460 --> 01:58:57.860
deft. Last week, Rob gave his impressions of go Fest 2020. And while I agree with some of the

01:58:57.860 --> 01:59:02.660
things he mentioned, I do want to give some of my own go Fest for me, wasn't bad at all. In fact,

01:59:02.660 --> 01:59:07.300
I quite enjoyed both days of it. I will start with the things Niantic needs to improve on.

01:59:07.300 --> 01:59:12.420
The first being server issues. They really need to upgrade the servers. Oh, sorry. My neck is stiff

01:59:12.420 --> 01:59:18.420
or be better prepared for events. Um, like this one, because it's not the first time this has

01:59:18.420 --> 01:59:24.100
happened that the APAC region, uh, get screwed, uh, one way or another for this. When the event

01:59:24.100 --> 01:59:29.780
started in the Americas, it was all right after the first hour or so they had to handle more

01:59:29.780 --> 01:59:35.140
than half a day with those server issues. And that's only my main gripe about go Fest. Really

01:59:35.140 --> 01:59:41.060
the event was pretty good. Um, I will address the biggest complaint that everyone had though,

01:59:41.060 --> 01:59:45.700
lack of Chinese. It does suck that there were people who didn't get even one, at least during

01:59:45.700 --> 01:59:49.220
the first day. But the thing is that Chinese shouldn't be given out like they were free

01:59:49.220 --> 01:59:54.660
candy. Yeah, they should have boosted odds and they did despite popular belief, but what happens

01:59:54.660 --> 01:59:59.300
with community day Chinese, you end up getting 10, 15, 20, and then you don't know what to do

01:59:59.300 --> 02:00:04.660
with them. I paid for Chinese. I read in here in some places I say, no, you paid for the event.

02:00:05.300 --> 02:00:15.700
Um, and yeah, you paid $15 or 280 Mexican pesos or around that $12 us. Um, but you paid for

02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:21.700
those special, uh, researches two days of special spawns and the team rocket event on Sunday,

02:00:21.700 --> 02:00:28.580
not to mention access to the special legendary Pokemon like shadow Mewtwo and Victini before

02:00:28.580 --> 02:00:35.220
everyone else that didn't pay. So for me in the end, it was really worth it. Something that a lot

02:00:35.220 --> 02:00:40.740
of people don't mention is that a regular go Fest ticket is only one day. Therefore, that's why many

02:00:40.740 --> 02:00:46.580
people do get a lot of Pokemon and Chinese because you are capturing or checking more Pokemon single

02:00:46.580 --> 02:00:53.060
session rather than a spread out event like this year's also that a lot of people didn't go out

02:00:53.060 --> 02:00:58.660
and probably just relied on incense like me to enjoy it. I got 20 Chinese in both days and I'm

02:00:58.660 --> 02:01:04.180
happy with that, but I'm also happy to have experienced more than just getting Chinese

02:01:04.180 --> 02:01:09.780
and did more to enjoy the go Fest itself, even under quarantine. So yeah, if you still think

02:01:09.780 --> 02:01:14.180
that it wasn't worth it or that expectations were way high, you're definitely entitled to that

02:01:14.180 --> 02:01:18.820
opinion. But my opinion is that I hope that they, uh, that they do this next year and hopefully

02:01:18.820 --> 02:01:23.460
even way better than what they did now. Thanks for reading this and have a good week, everyone.

02:01:24.260 --> 02:01:29.460
Thank you. Great email. And you know, not, not everybody has to agree with me a hundred percent

02:01:29.460 --> 02:01:34.900
at a time and that's fine. Um, so, and honestly, I think everything that active said in the email,

02:01:34.900 --> 02:01:40.020
like I, I get it like, yeah, you know, the, the comment about the shiny shouldn't be like candy

02:01:40.020 --> 02:01:44.660
and how irritated do we get when, you know, you get like 11 of them and what the hell are you

02:01:44.660 --> 02:01:48.740
supposed to do with all that? Those shiny is like, I kind of get that. And I think all that,

02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:55.620
that feedback is fair for me. I still think the price was a little bit high. Um, but especially

02:01:55.620 --> 02:02:01.620
when you compare like what the people who paid got and what the people who didn't pay got,

02:02:01.620 --> 02:02:05.140
which was a lot of the similar stuff when it came to the biomes and things like that.

02:02:05.140 --> 02:02:09.460
But like, you know what, if it made the game fun and it was something to do for a weekend,

02:02:10.020 --> 02:02:15.300
it was the cost of a movie or whatever, you know, cool. And I don't, if, if I hated the game,

02:02:15.300 --> 02:02:20.020
I wouldn't play it. You know, it's all about feedback and, uh, helping Niantic make the

02:02:20.020 --> 02:02:23.780
game better and all of that. And I think they, there will be a lot that they're going to have

02:02:23.780 --> 02:02:31.860
to put into next year's event. Um, my assumption is, um, assuming COVID is under control enough in

02:02:31.860 --> 02:02:36.420
a year's time, let's hope good for goodness sakes, but assuming we're at the point where we can start

02:02:36.420 --> 02:02:42.420
talking about larger events like that, at least outdoors, um, in a year's time, I, I would see

02:02:42.420 --> 02:02:48.340
that there's probably going to be a live and virtual event. Why wouldn't there be make money

02:02:48.340 --> 02:02:53.620
twice? Uh, it would be a great way to do it. So, um, I could see, I could see that the virtual

02:02:53.620 --> 02:02:58.660
events will probably still be around in some fashion or another. So, um, it'll be interesting

02:02:58.660 --> 02:03:05.620
to see what comes to that. Um, I will say this for as much as I really dug my heels in and didn't

02:03:05.620 --> 02:03:13.220
care for the team rocket battling stuff, the day two of the event made it so easy that I did kind

02:03:13.220 --> 02:03:19.300
of start checking more balloons after the event. And I've kind of been playing it a little more.

02:03:19.300 --> 02:03:25.620
I mean, anything greater than zero is still greater than zero. Um, and I got really frustrated

02:03:25.620 --> 02:03:30.420
trying to take out a leader today because they're way harder during the week, you know, during

02:03:30.420 --> 02:03:35.940
normal playtime than it was during the Go Fest. They were, they were rollover easy during Go Fest.

02:03:35.940 --> 02:03:41.140
Um, but, uh, yeah, but I mean, of course you don't want the game to be a hundred percent a gimme

02:03:41.140 --> 02:03:47.140
either. I should be challenged a little bit. So I will say I'm warming up a little bit, just a little

02:03:47.140 --> 02:03:52.420
bit to that mode. It's still not the bread and butter of the game for me. Um, but I can, I can

02:03:52.420 --> 02:03:59.300
get into it a little bit. So, um, and as is being pointed out, uh, in chat a couple of places, um,

02:03:59.300 --> 02:04:03.540
SD100 Matt is saying they did screw up a portion of the game that they plan to redo that portion

02:04:03.540 --> 02:04:07.140
as a separate event. That is true. Um, and I'm sure you probably had already heard that it's in

02:04:07.140 --> 02:04:12.420
the end game news, but they are going to be doing a three hour makeup event of sorts, uh, in mid

02:04:12.420 --> 02:04:17.300
August. I forget, was it the 16th? I don't remember. I could be mixing it up with community day.

02:04:17.300 --> 02:04:22.740
Um, but they are going to be doing a, a makeup event. So that'll be cool. So, all right. Well,

02:04:22.740 --> 02:04:29.060
thank you for the email. Appreciate that. Send us more participate at orange lounge radio.com.

02:04:29.060 --> 02:04:34.100
In the meantime, let's get to some more stories, uh, here tonight. Loki.

02:04:35.300 --> 02:04:39.540
All right. Um, so this is something I actually have personally experienced myself. So

02:04:40.100 --> 02:04:48.340
there's been a lot of talk on, um, Twitter recently about the PSPs, uh, batteries

02:04:48.340 --> 02:04:53.780
swelling, and I've actually had this problem myself. So yes, if you own a PS,

02:04:53.780 --> 02:05:00.420
I'm sorry. Same. Yes. I was going to say, if you own a PSP, double check your batteries,

02:05:00.420 --> 02:05:06.260
cause they may have swung or swelled and that's, you want to dispose of them. Um, I've had several

02:05:06.260 --> 02:05:12.980
batteries in my PSPs. Actually, I think all of them have had to be basically thrown away because

02:05:12.980 --> 02:05:18.100
they have, uh, swollen. I first noticed that actually with my, I had a Pandora's battery,

02:05:18.100 --> 02:05:22.660
so there was a battery that you could use to actually hack the PSP. And that one was just

02:05:22.660 --> 02:05:29.140
ridiculously swollen. Um, so that's unfortunate. Um, if you do play the PSP though, you can get

02:05:29.140 --> 02:05:34.340
replacement batteries relatively cheap, but it's just, it's unfortunate that that's even a thing.

02:05:34.340 --> 02:05:38.660
And apparently it is a wide spread issue, but not something that Sony's going to do about it

02:05:38.660 --> 02:05:43.380
because you know, PSP is really old and I don't know what you're going to do, but it's also not

02:05:43.380 --> 02:05:48.420
an unheard of thing for anything that uses a lithium ion battery, um, for the swelling to be,

02:05:48.980 --> 02:05:52.900
it helps contain the content within, it happens to phones. I mean,

02:05:52.900 --> 02:05:57.140
when you have a battery that's consumed or depleted and you're charging it again,

02:05:57.140 --> 02:06:06.340
I mean, it's, it's not an uncommon thing across multiple technological, uh, disciplines, devices.

02:06:06.900 --> 02:06:12.180
Well, all those of you that found our show through olrpsp.com, look out.

02:06:14.100 --> 02:06:17.940
Well, I mean, yeah, it's just make sure that, you know, if you have your stored in like,

02:06:18.020 --> 02:06:22.660
you know, somewhere, uh, the check on them, make sure they're not leaking or exploding or close

02:06:22.660 --> 02:06:28.820
to, you know, breaking, you might want to put a dispose of them, uh, properly. Cause I know

02:06:28.820 --> 02:06:33.220
I had to, I had to get rid of mine through the hazardous waste stuff. Um,

02:06:33.220 --> 02:06:37.220
I don't even know if I could find my PSP at this point. Good Lord. I wonder where the hell it is.

02:06:37.220 --> 02:06:39.940
I think the places like Best Buy will do battery disposal.

02:06:39.940 --> 02:06:44.180
Yeah. A lot of those places will, I know them that you just drop it off, but,

02:06:44.180 --> 02:06:49.300
um, yeah, just keep it in mind, especially if you have some of these older electronics that have

02:06:49.300 --> 02:06:53.140
these types of batteries, you may want to check up on them just to make sure that they aren't leaking

02:06:53.140 --> 02:07:00.340
or, you know, uh, expanding like this, uh, sucks for anybody that had the PSP go. Cause I think

02:07:00.340 --> 02:07:08.340
that thing was like built in. Um, I just have the, the PSTV. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that that's,

02:07:08.340 --> 02:07:13.940
that's safe. I don't know where mine is. I still, I have it somewhere. I just can't

02:07:14.500 --> 02:07:20.660
solely to play Danganronpa, uh, ultra despair girls. And then we played like that, uh,

02:07:21.220 --> 02:07:30.980
Tempest, uh, 2000 clone. So like T2K or something. I have mine, uh, specifically right now to play

02:07:30.980 --> 02:07:37.060
pixel shit. So, you know, there's that, uh, or I'm sorry, pixel poops. I think it was on, um,

02:07:37.140 --> 02:07:45.780
the PS, the Vita. So, um, so yeah, it's, uh, it is unfortunate, um, that I had to get rid of those,

02:07:45.780 --> 02:07:54.740
but what are you going to do? Yeah. So breaking news here on OLR, it's not video game related,

02:07:54.740 --> 02:08:00.100
but it's related to something I always talk about every year. So, you know, how they do the crazy

02:08:00.100 --> 02:08:06.580
flavors of Lay's potato chips every year, I had no idea they were doing it again this year,

02:08:06.660 --> 02:08:12.020
but apparently they are because I just got a message from Alan that he has placed in the

02:08:12.020 --> 02:08:19.700
shopping cart, Nashville hot chicken flavored Lay's and carnitas street taco flavored Lay's.

02:08:20.580 --> 02:08:25.540
They get me some and I will come pick them up. Those are on their way home right now. And I

02:08:25.540 --> 02:08:30.580
will be after the show tonight testing, assuming he gets home in time, but then we've been, I will

02:08:30.580 --> 02:08:35.940
test them live on air. Seriously, Rob, if he's not on his way home back, tell him to get me too.

02:08:35.940 --> 02:08:40.660
I will pick them up off your porch. Hold on. Feel time for me while I text, please.

02:08:41.460 --> 02:08:46.660
All right. Cause I'd have to go get them on, um, on Wednesday. I'm on my day off for after work,

02:08:46.660 --> 02:08:53.140
but I mean, I'm also getting thanks to one of our wonderful listeners. I'm getting a baconator,

02:08:53.140 --> 02:08:57.380
uh, Pringles and I'm really looking forward to trying them. I haven't been able to find them

02:08:57.380 --> 02:09:02.900
anywhere. Um, no, I know Dan wants the hot chicken ones. I won't touch those, but the carnitas

02:09:03.540 --> 02:09:07.460
sounds delightful. There was a couple of other flavors too that look just amazing, but

02:09:08.420 --> 02:09:14.740
it's funny. Like I eat more chips now than I used to ever eat. I have Calbee pizza chips. I have

02:09:14.740 --> 02:09:18.180
honey butter chips. I have a bunch of chocolate cause I went to the Rocky mountain chocolate

02:09:18.180 --> 02:09:23.620
company today that has nothing to do with video games. So, um, no, they do have to do a video

02:09:23.620 --> 02:09:29.860
games. Cause you know what I do when I play video games, I eat chips. That's why I'm trying to play

02:09:29.860 --> 02:09:35.460
more GPS games to walk this off to bring up something else about the giggle, the giggle leak

02:09:35.460 --> 02:09:44.820
too. Um, is it, there was a hockey RPG and it's been talked about before, but yeah, the, um,

02:09:44.820 --> 02:09:53.220
it w it, uh, there is a, there was a prototype version of this hockey RPG that never came out,

02:09:53.220 --> 02:09:57.220
came out, come out eventually on the super Nintendo, but it never came out in the

02:09:57.220 --> 02:10:03.940
Nintendo or the NES. Um, I was gonna say, so one of the things I'm, I normally, uh,

02:10:03.940 --> 02:10:10.340
like to have is popcorn. Um, and because we threw, we rented a bounce house for my son

02:10:10.340 --> 02:10:15.060
for his birthday because we can't go anywhere cause of COVID. Um, but we also rented a popcorn

02:10:15.060 --> 02:10:22.420
machine and so the popcorn machine, you know, we, we try to pop, they, they gave you a ton of

02:10:22.420 --> 02:10:29.380
popcorn, the pop, and um, I couldn't eat it all. So I popped the rest of it and put it in

02:10:30.180 --> 02:10:39.540
this giant that I'm going to be eating all week. Love it. Yeah. All right. And Jamie,

02:10:39.540 --> 02:10:42.820
good news. I think Alan did get my message. I think he's taking care of it. I'm waiting

02:10:42.820 --> 02:10:47.700
on confirmation. So I can pick it up after work on Tuesday. Yeah, no worries. Just let us know

02:10:47.700 --> 02:10:54.740
when to put it out. All right. Um, meanwhile, let's talk. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. We can do a trade.

02:10:54.740 --> 02:10:59.460
That'd be fun. Cause when you do it off a card, you can actually pick what villager leaves. Huh?

02:11:00.660 --> 02:11:04.660
Yeah. I actually, I think, yeah, I think I, yeah, I have, I have a few extra spares,

02:11:04.660 --> 02:11:08.740
so I'll just give you my spares. Okay, cool. And I have all the Sanrio cards now,

02:11:08.740 --> 02:11:13.060
so I think I've already sent you some posters. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Let's move on though.

02:11:13.060 --> 02:11:17.380
Just got to make sure we get all the stories done. Uh, let's talk about a game that I,

02:11:17.380 --> 02:11:21.620
I don't know if this game is savable and I I'm kind of curious of your guys' thoughts.

02:11:21.620 --> 02:11:26.500
Um, but it's the game Anthem from BioWare. Um, and, oh, and I got confirmation from Alan.

02:11:26.500 --> 02:11:31.700
You're good, Jamie. All right. Thank you, Alan. So, um, BioWare is going to be making some more

02:11:31.700 --> 02:11:37.540
changes for Anthem and they did a big blog post and, uh, talking a bit about loot. And I think

02:11:37.540 --> 02:11:41.860
it's worth mentioning because, you know, if you look at some of the games that have been salvaged

02:11:41.860 --> 02:11:46.980
and they've been salvaged in a big way, you know, No Man's Sky, Final Fantasy 14, one of them that

02:11:46.980 --> 02:11:53.940
comes to mind is Diablo 3. Um, Diablo 3 had the, um, problem with loot in the early versions of

02:11:53.940 --> 02:12:00.020
the game. And it was one of the biggest changes they made to the game was to actually, um, sorry,

02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:05.060
he just sent me a picture with like a shopping cart full of chips.

02:12:06.020 --> 02:12:12.180
Hell yeah. Looks like, uh, looks like we're smoking weed tonight. All right. Anyway, um, sorry.

02:12:14.180 --> 02:12:19.380
So loot was a big thing in Diablo and changing that and getting that right was a huge step in

02:12:19.380 --> 02:12:24.020
making that game better. So some of the things that they're talking about doing in Anthem,

02:12:24.020 --> 02:12:30.820
um, number one is respecting your time, increasing the frequency of loot drops, making loot viable

02:12:30.820 --> 02:12:37.220
more often. I know I'm excited about the loot too, Mr. Smoosh, aren't you? Uh, that loot will

02:12:37.220 --> 02:12:44.900
be viable more often and loot rarities will have value throughout progression. Okay. You can also

02:12:44.900 --> 02:12:49.860
look for specific loot without having to rely on randomness. So that would be nice. You can also

02:12:49.860 --> 02:12:55.700
modify your loot, kind of like reforging it, um, make sure that you can reveal and equip your loot

02:12:55.700 --> 02:13:02.020
right away. Uh, and so on and so on. So they're doing some big changes to loot, but I can't help

02:13:02.020 --> 02:13:07.780
but shake the feeling that this, this game is already gone. Like this, this game just,

02:13:07.780 --> 02:13:14.180
they've got to move on. It's not savable at this point, in my opinion, they might try to do like a

02:13:14.180 --> 02:13:20.260
sequel or an expansion cause that's kind of how Diablo did it. And I could see them maybe trying

02:13:20.260 --> 02:13:26.100
to do it that way, but I just don't see how Anthem is like, people are going to care.

02:13:28.340 --> 02:13:32.340
I haven't thought about Anthem in an age. I know, I don't think about it until we have

02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:36.980
these type of stories. And then I feel like I'm only here to kick it while it's down because of

02:13:36.980 --> 02:13:42.900
what my feeling is, whether it's true or not about what it did for Mass Effect, you know? So

02:13:44.260 --> 02:13:49.940
if they would announce that Mass Effect remaster already, I might like be more

02:13:49.940 --> 02:13:55.380
excited about Anthem. I don't know. Probably not, but, uh, all right. Uh, I was seeing if

02:13:55.380 --> 02:13:58.180
anybody in chat was talking about it, but they're, they're talking about Mr. Smoosh

02:13:58.180 --> 02:14:03.620
screaming in the background, which I don't blame them. All right. So let's move in here somewhere.

02:14:04.660 --> 02:14:10.500
Oh, we had a really, this is not very loud. You missed a dark Sakura after you left,

02:14:10.500 --> 02:14:16.420
but Stella Loki's cat, like jumped up on him and started like, Oh, did you see it? So,

02:14:16.900 --> 02:14:19.780
so cute. Oh yeah. That's right. Cause the clip, I put the clip on Twitter.

02:14:22.020 --> 02:14:28.100
She's sitting right here. Like she wants me to pick her up or feed her or something. I don't

02:14:28.100 --> 02:14:33.140
know. I'm already switching. I'm switching Midna's food. So she's been kind of weird all day. I'm

02:14:33.140 --> 02:14:38.500
about to put her on raw food. So I will say it's, it's cropped out of my shot. I'll just quickly

02:14:38.500 --> 02:14:45.540
peek and show here. I do have the smoosh basket ready and waiting to see if Mr. Smoosh will come

02:14:45.540 --> 02:14:52.420
back and sit in it as he did that one night. So if he, if he does, uh, my co-host will have to

02:14:52.420 --> 02:14:56.020
understand that I'm going to cut them out for a minute for Mr. Smoosh to put that onto, or I'll

02:14:56.020 --> 02:15:01.380
just move my, I'll pan my camera over. I'll be off cam. That's fine. I personally have to pause

02:15:01.380 --> 02:15:09.060
the feed because, uh, a bandwidth and I'll get distracted. Although like where I have it paused,

02:15:09.060 --> 02:15:13.460
I've got like this incredible side eye that might be worth a screenshot.

02:15:13.700 --> 02:15:17.860
All right, let's move on. Dark soccer, you have a new story for us. What's old is new again.

02:15:17.860 --> 02:15:24.580
Um, yeah. And, um, it's not really super new. The announcement's been out for a little bit,

02:15:24.580 --> 02:15:33.140
but the analog pocket retro, which is basically, um, uh, a Game Boy, um, it's going to be portable.

02:15:33.140 --> 02:15:39.860
It also will play, uh, uh, hold on, I'm getting the information about it. So yeah. So, um, it's

02:15:40.500 --> 02:15:50.100
got a 3.5 inch, um, uh, 1600 by 1440 pixel display. Um, the nano loop music creation software,

02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:56.660
it can play Game Boy, Game Boy colors, Game Boy advanced games natively. Um, and it's available

02:15:56.660 --> 02:16:04.820
to pre-order starting on August 3rd, um, at noon Eastern. The analog pocket is, uh, 200 bucks.

02:16:05.460 --> 02:16:12.580
And there's also a dock which has HDMI out and up to four external controllers for another hundred.

02:16:12.580 --> 02:16:20.340
It looks really sleek. It keeps that bait that, uh, that Game Boy styling, like more like the, uh,

02:16:21.300 --> 02:16:28.180
yeah, like the Game Boy color. Um, but it's got that clear screen. Um, and on top of that, um,

02:16:28.820 --> 02:16:33.140
they, they did do a little bit of tweaking since their first, uh, release of the images.

02:16:33.780 --> 02:16:40.260
Um, and they have, um, for the, uh, to protect it. There's also a transparent hard case, um,

02:16:40.260 --> 02:16:45.780
that you can use with it. Um, and then cartridge adapters. So the adapters are really cool because

02:16:45.780 --> 02:16:52.660
they'll adapt for Neo Geo pocket color game gear and done, done, done Atari links, which I think

02:16:52.660 --> 02:16:59.700
one of our Atari links has just died. Kind of sad. Um, but at any rate, I mean, I think it's

02:16:59.700 --> 02:17:04.820
going to be absolutely worthy. Um, I don't know if we're going to get one. We talked about it.

02:17:05.540 --> 02:17:11.540
Um, you know, I would, I would be happy if it also like had an adapter for, uh, for, uh,

02:17:11.540 --> 02:17:16.020
turbo graphics games. Cause the screen would definitely be better than that of the turbo express

02:17:16.580 --> 02:17:21.460
or wonders one. I mean, that would be great too, but I'm not really complaining. It, it looks

02:17:21.460 --> 02:17:28.580
beautiful. And the, the button shape looks actually pretty comfortable and analog has just

02:17:28.580 --> 02:17:39.220
made amazing, um, amazing, uh, equipment. So I'm down. I, it looks, it looks really good to me too.

02:17:39.220 --> 02:17:43.300
Like it's almost one of those things where it almost looks preferable to the original hardware,

02:17:43.300 --> 02:17:48.420
which I don't say often, but those game boys were kind of bricks. They didn't, they weren't

02:17:48.420 --> 02:17:54.260
very well lit. It would definitely break. Yeah. You know, they, they ate through batteries and

02:17:54.260 --> 02:17:58.340
stuff, you know, they were great at the time, but I kind of loved the idea of taking these cartridges

02:17:58.340 --> 02:18:02.180
and playing them on a device that, you know, and it's not really meant to like modernize the games

02:18:02.180 --> 02:18:06.740
or anything, but just like make them look nice and crystal clear on a screen. Probably eats a

02:18:06.740 --> 02:18:11.540
little less power. It's it just, it looks really good. Like I kind of want to get one. I kind of

02:18:11.540 --> 02:18:15.060
have too much shit in this house already. And I bought an arcade machine this year,

02:18:15.060 --> 02:18:22.740
but I'm still tempted. See my house, Rob. I know, I know, but you know, there's a lot here and we

02:18:22.740 --> 02:18:28.340
want to make sure, you know, with some of my older systems, like, well, even the Neo Geo Pocket

02:18:28.340 --> 02:18:33.940
Color, we had to have, um, you know, the, the lighting on it. Um, we found my Game Boy Advance

02:18:33.940 --> 02:18:40.900
with its afterburner in it. My, my pink one, like I actually have a pink thing. Um, we found Dan's

02:18:40.900 --> 02:18:46.580
his afterburner died. Mine still works. So, you know, it's nice to have something that's backlit

02:18:46.580 --> 02:18:50.340
that will play everything in great clarity. The only reason I would really like want to have the

02:18:50.340 --> 02:18:56.580
wonders one color addition on it would be to play, uh, the final fantasy games in, in higher

02:18:56.580 --> 02:19:02.340
resolution. So, all right. Well, we just have a few more stories before we get to wrapping things

02:19:02.340 --> 02:19:07.380
up tonight with your questions in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash a VOG network. But first

02:19:07.380 --> 02:19:13.860
Loki. Yes. So there's a pretty cool achievement that's happened with, uh, Metal Gear Solid five.

02:19:13.860 --> 02:19:19.940
So they have the whole cold war, uh, multiplayer thing that they could do where I guess you could

02:19:20.100 --> 02:19:28.180
also, um, disarm nukes in the game as well. And apparently there was an achievement. I think once

02:19:28.180 --> 02:19:35.700
that they had like either hacked to get, um, in the game or a hack to achieve it originally,

02:19:35.700 --> 02:19:42.180
but then actually now they've finally done it officially without hacks, um, to basically

02:19:42.180 --> 02:19:49.460
trigger this nuclear disarmament achievement, uh, which is pretty cool. So it happened on the 27th

02:19:50.020 --> 02:20:02.100
of July. And apparently there was 2,500 nukes total, I guess on, um, I guess on the PlayStation

02:20:02.100 --> 02:20:08.740
4, there's still 2,500 nukes in the 19,000 on PC, but PS3 one was low enough to where they were able

02:20:08.740 --> 02:20:12.500
to actually make that achievement happen. But apparently it hasn't happened on the other systems

02:20:12.500 --> 02:20:18.420
yet, but still pretty neat that people are, um, you know, trying to get that achievement, you know,

02:20:18.420 --> 02:20:24.340
this what five years after the games come out. Um, I don't know, like, I think the only other

02:20:24.340 --> 02:20:27.940
team I could think that's kind of like that word. There's a lot of collaboration was probably like

02:20:27.940 --> 02:20:31.700
nobody, nobody boy where, you know, we have to reach the different planets and stuff for girl.

02:20:32.980 --> 02:20:39.860
Or that old walking game on the Game Boy Advance. Was it everybody walks or something? I know some

02:20:39.860 --> 02:20:43.380
game where it was just like a walking device that you kept with you. And then it was like,

02:20:43.380 --> 02:20:48.100
we have all walked to the moon with how much we've walked. I don't remember the name of the game.

02:20:48.900 --> 02:20:55.140
That that wasn't like on the, um, DS or anything like how they had like the stuff where it was a

02:20:55.140 --> 02:21:01.620
3DS or DS that had no 3DS. I think it was on the advance because of that game is where they kind

02:21:01.620 --> 02:21:08.180
of got the idea to build it into the DS and 3DS. Oh, okay. Yeah. I don't know. But yes, it's, it's

02:21:08.180 --> 02:21:12.340
an achievement. Um, yeah, I guess we'll have to wait and see when that happens on PlayStation 4

02:21:12.340 --> 02:21:18.340
and on the PC. It's kind of interesting to me that there's a very loyal community that

02:21:18.340 --> 02:21:23.300
has kind of worked on getting this achievement and bringing this achievement and making it happen.

02:21:23.300 --> 02:21:28.740
Um, I'm trying to think if I've ever worked on something like this for an old game, trying to

02:21:28.740 --> 02:21:32.420
work on some achievement together. I can't think of anything. Can you guys?

02:21:34.500 --> 02:21:38.180
I don't think I stick with a game long enough to do it. I don't know. Well, then again,

02:21:38.180 --> 02:21:41.620
I don't know, like some of the stuff I talked about a couple of weeks ago on the show with

02:21:41.620 --> 02:21:47.380
Ingress and portal scanning. I've done a lot. I broke 300 unique portal scans this week. So,

02:21:47.380 --> 02:21:53.300
um, I've been doing that a lot still. So I guess everybody has their thing in one way or another,

02:21:53.300 --> 02:21:59.140
but yeah. So, all right. Uh, moving on, we've got one more story for you guys.

02:21:59.140 --> 02:22:04.580
And this has to do with, uh, a video game that I don't know. It was one of those games. It was

02:22:04.580 --> 02:22:08.260
like, I don't know if it was really that good, but it was kind of one of those.

02:22:08.260 --> 02:22:16.420
It was so bad. It was good. And that was Def Jam fight for New York. Uh, and there were some,

02:22:16.420 --> 02:22:20.100
you know, different fighters in the game that were based off of real people. One of them being

02:22:20.100 --> 02:22:26.420
Ice-T, uh, and Ice-T wrote a tweet this week saying gamer stuff. I think they really need

02:22:26.420 --> 02:22:31.460
to reboot this game for the new consoles and actually put a picture on his feed of himself,

02:22:31.460 --> 02:22:38.420
basically in a Def Jam fight for New York. And, um, you know, I, I think it's so obviously he

02:22:38.420 --> 02:22:41.540
owns the game and he plays it sometime or whatever. Maybe, I don't know, maybe it was

02:22:41.540 --> 02:22:46.420
at a friend's or something and saw it. Uh, but he was all about the idea for a reboot. Uh, this

02:22:46.420 --> 02:22:52.020
dates all the way back to 2004. It was on PlayStation two, X-Box and GameCube. You could

02:22:52.020 --> 02:22:57.860
play us like Snoop Dogg and, you know, um, other, other folks as well. We need that game back.

02:22:57.860 --> 02:23:07.140
Yeah. What? They did reboot it. Um, Def Jam icon. It was a rhythm. It was a fighting game that had

02:23:07.140 --> 02:23:14.340
a rhythm element to it as well. You could play your own MP3s. It was not good. Okay. But take

02:23:14.340 --> 02:23:19.380
that element out of it. He mentioned that particular one then. Right. Yeah. This would be

02:23:19.380 --> 02:23:24.180
a little bit different, but, um, I mean, yeah, sure. Why not? Just because you reboot it once

02:23:24.180 --> 02:23:28.500
and it doesn't work out. Doesn't mean you can't try again. Well, you know, I mean, it's not like

02:23:28.500 --> 02:23:35.220
Ice-T doesn't have the type of pull to be able to make something like that happen. Uh, I mean, isn't

02:23:35.220 --> 02:23:39.780
this, isn't something similar to this, how we got a new Shaq-Fu game at the end of the day? Was,

02:23:39.780 --> 02:23:45.700
didn't Shaquille O'Neal say something about it? I mean, Ice-T could like have the investment to,

02:23:45.700 --> 02:23:51.060
I mean, not that I think, you know, he's, he's a normal person who just is very high profile. I

02:23:51.140 --> 02:23:55.780
don't think he has oodles and oodles of cash, but he might have enough to make a small investment

02:23:55.780 --> 02:23:59.780
in something like this and make it happen. Especially if he got some of the other,

02:23:59.780 --> 02:24:04.180
uh, big names that were in the old game kind of together, uh, get the old band back together,

02:24:04.180 --> 02:24:10.100
so to speak and fund a game like this. I don't know. Maybe. I mean, sure. Why not?

02:24:10.980 --> 02:24:16.180
Uh, DJ Roma S also points out the Japanese version has different characters. It has Def Jam,

02:24:16.180 --> 02:24:21.780
Japanese artists in it. SSJ 100 Matt simply says, I take an HD remaster. Jeff Jam, Def Jam

02:24:21.780 --> 02:24:26.020
fight for New York was great. I think it was still played at Evo for amateur tournaments.

02:24:26.020 --> 02:24:30.740
Um, so yeah, I think there are a lot of people that remember that game very fondly, even though

02:24:30.740 --> 02:24:36.340
I, I swore it had really bad reviews. Like it was not like well received critically,

02:24:36.340 --> 02:24:39.860
but it doesn't matter what critics think at the end of the day. It's what the players want.

02:24:39.860 --> 02:24:44.180
So it matters if it's fun or not. That's right. All right. Yeah, that's true.

02:24:44.180 --> 02:24:49.540
SJ 100 Matt says if they put it on Kickstarter, it would fund so fast. Yeah. Why not? I mean,

02:24:49.540 --> 02:24:52.900
a lot of video games have been doing very well through Kickstarter. So maybe this is one of

02:24:52.900 --> 02:24:58.100
those games that should take that route as well. All right. If you guys have other questions for

02:24:58.100 --> 02:25:01.700
us, we'd like to open up the listener round table via chat. So if you have other questions,

02:25:01.700 --> 02:25:07.540
you can go ahead and put that into chat. Um, for example, uh, in chat we have She-Hulk because we

02:25:07.540 --> 02:25:12.180
brought up potato chips earlier on the show, which I hear Alan getting home, which means

02:25:12.180 --> 02:25:18.100
there's chips coming, but She-Hulk says, have you guys ever tried ooze? Am I saying that right?

02:25:18.100 --> 02:25:25.940
UTZ, ooze, fried dill pickle, ripples, potato chips. I have, I have not, but that sounds good.

02:25:25.940 --> 02:25:33.700
I like fried pickles. Yeah. I did have pickle chips though. I like Japanese pickles like,

02:25:33.940 --> 02:25:45.780
uh, or, um, like other delicious pickles. Oh yeah. Alan wanted to make Alan want to make clear.

02:25:45.780 --> 02:25:51.380
This is not a promotional spot. They're not paying us. I may eat these and they may be garbage.

02:25:51.380 --> 02:25:55.540
We'll find out later in the show or after the show tonight, live on Twitch, I should say.

02:25:55.540 --> 02:26:02.500
All right. Anyhow. Uh, ooze. Okay. Sorry. I am not familiar with ooze. I don't think it

02:26:02.500 --> 02:26:08.100
must be a brand that they don't carry on this coast. It's one of those things where it's like

02:26:08.100 --> 02:26:14.020
Hellmann's and best foods. They don't carry it across the nation. I did find dill pickle

02:26:14.020 --> 02:26:19.620
pringles. And if you want them, I'll get them for you. I've had pickle chip. Uh, fried pickles was

02:26:19.620 --> 02:26:25.460
one of the crazy lace flavors like two years ago. No pringles. No, I'm sorry. It was fried tomatoes,

02:26:25.460 --> 02:26:29.860
not fried pickles. I'm sorry. I'll get you the, I'll get you the, the pringles. I'll actually buy

02:26:29.860 --> 02:26:36.260
a pickle product for you. That sounds good. I like pickles. All right. Um, all right.

02:26:37.140 --> 02:26:41.460
Well, I think, I think we're gonna wrap up the show. Um, but first I want to check in and see

02:26:41.460 --> 02:26:48.740
if we have any last minute stories from Loki. Sure. Um, so there was some pretty cool stuff

02:26:48.740 --> 02:26:56.100
that, um, I saw regarding, um, apparently there's a spiritual successor for space quest

02:26:56.180 --> 02:27:03.540
that is now playable. So it was Kickstarter back in 2012. And it's a game called space venture.

02:27:04.420 --> 02:27:11.620
And so now apparently you can play an early beta version of it. Yeah. Let's, let's that,

02:27:11.620 --> 02:27:17.460
that's a long time. That was a lot, but Bobby's in chat saying I'm a backer of this damn project.

02:27:17.460 --> 02:27:24.420
I got my demo key. Yay. Congrats. Uh, you can check it out now. Um, it looks unique. I mean,

02:27:24.420 --> 02:27:33.700
I don't, I see, I mean, it looks sort of like space quest, but I don't know. It's not exactly,

02:27:33.700 --> 02:27:41.300
but neat if it's the same type of gameplay. Um, so I'm down and then apparently the PlayStation

02:27:41.300 --> 02:27:51.620
emulator, um, R R P C three is now getting, um, network play as well. So they're developing

02:27:51.620 --> 02:27:58.980
a private PlayStation network server replacement for our RPCN. And apparently it's going to be

02:27:59.700 --> 02:28:07.060
free and open source and yeah, right now they can play demon souls and bomber man ultra over it.

02:28:08.100 --> 02:28:12.420
So neat. Um, definitely be cool in the preservation space.

02:28:14.260 --> 02:28:20.420
Cool. And that's it. That's it. All right. That's it. All right. Um,

02:28:20.420 --> 02:28:24.420
so that's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio. Thank you guys so much for

02:28:24.420 --> 02:28:28.260
listening to our show tonight and staying up with us. Uh, we appreciate it. I hope you guys have a

02:28:28.260 --> 02:28:32.420
great week with playing video games. Uh, if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch

02:28:32.420 --> 02:28:36.660
radio, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but the voices

02:28:36.660 --> 02:28:41.540
have to be here for us to put out on air. Uh, so tell a friend or two about the show, um, share on

02:28:41.540 --> 02:28:46.660
social media that goes a long way as well. Uh, auto hosting VOG network on Twitch goes a real,

02:28:46.660 --> 02:28:52.260
real long way. Super appreciate that. Um, and yeah, um, we'll be back to do it all again in

02:28:52.260 --> 02:28:57.860
another week with the episode eight 31 of our show. Uh, before we do that though, we have to

02:28:57.860 --> 02:29:03.620
go around and get everybody's final thoughts. So, uh, dark Sakura, why don't you start us off?

02:29:03.620 --> 02:29:06.580
You haven't been here to wrap up the show for awhile. So what's your final thought?

02:29:07.460 --> 02:29:16.500
Um, my hip hurts. I'm ready to get it like an epidural. I'm tired of feeling like I'm 97.

02:29:16.500 --> 02:29:23.700
Now I know why old people moved to Arizona. All right. And my final thought, because Bobby's,

02:29:23.700 --> 02:29:27.780
uh, hooting and hollering in chat is that the beta is not available to the public Loki. You

02:29:27.780 --> 02:29:32.820
have to have backed it in 2012. It's a personalized beta key. You can watch

02:29:32.820 --> 02:29:35.540
YouTube videos. There you go. That's how you can check it out. There you go.

02:29:35.540 --> 02:29:43.700
Play it needs an NDA, right? Well, I don't even maybe it, well, I guess it would be hard to put

02:29:43.700 --> 02:29:48.980
something like that under NDA. Cause I was gonna say it might actually be, uh, you, you laugh that

02:29:48.980 --> 02:29:55.620
off, but it might be. Um, but I think if it's anything like blood stained or, uh, several of

02:29:55.620 --> 02:30:00.900
the other gaming Kickstarters, I think that's kind of too hard to keep contained, uh, something like

02:30:00.900 --> 02:30:04.900
that. So something else you need to check out though, if, if you get a chance to, there's a

02:30:04.900 --> 02:30:10.740
lot of preview videos out there now for the new Microsoft flight simulator, 2020. Holy cow. Does

02:30:10.740 --> 02:30:17.540
that look fantastic? Just the amount of detail is just, it's unbelievable. It's just ridiculous.

02:30:17.540 --> 02:30:21.300
And I absolutely heard you mentioning that. I thought you said stimulator.

02:30:23.220 --> 02:30:32.740
Um, no, although I have seen like one of those strange, strange addiction things where someone

02:30:32.740 --> 02:30:40.340
was in love with a aircraft, um, or certain planes. So yeah, the Pan Am planes I watched

02:30:40.980 --> 02:30:46.740
and he had bought like the, the catering console. All right. Yeah. That was pretty cool though.

02:30:46.740 --> 02:30:51.460
Loki, your final thought. I found thought is I'm going to try to be productive over the next three

02:30:51.460 --> 02:30:54.980
days, at least with something. I don't know what I'm going to be working on, but something.

02:30:54.980 --> 02:30:57.940
All right. Make it happen. Make it work. Like Tim Gunn says, make it work.

02:30:59.140 --> 02:31:07.140
I believe Jamie still has a contest open for you. All right. Yeah. All right. That's the way Rob,

02:31:07.140 --> 02:31:11.460
I was going to let you know. Um, I'm, since I'm not doing, doing drag con anymore,

02:31:12.180 --> 02:31:16.500
it's looking like if everything is open next year, dragon con will be it for me.

02:31:17.540 --> 02:31:22.980
Wait, you're going to do dragon con next year. I'm thinking so. And I already know what my first

02:31:22.980 --> 02:31:27.860
cosplay is going to be. Oh, this is a big news. This is big news. Bobby, you hearing this?

02:31:28.740 --> 02:31:34.500
I am going to do, uh, uh, Ewok village Leia from return of the Jedi.

02:31:34.500 --> 02:31:41.140
Huh? Wow. I wonder if this is going to be motivation for more VOG people to make their

02:31:41.140 --> 02:31:47.380
way to dragon con next year. So that is a very exciting. All right. Assuming of course, everything

02:31:47.380 --> 02:31:55.300
is safe. Yeah, but that's assuming it's an entire year plus out. So we'll, we'll, we'll have a host

02:31:55.300 --> 02:31:59.540
of other problems if we haven't that under, if we haven't gotten that under control by then.

02:31:59.540 --> 02:32:04.740
So, you know, funny asking, is it safe reminds me of the clerk's animated series.

02:32:05.300 --> 02:32:11.300
Remember that reference a little bit. Yeah. All right. That's it. Roll credits. We're out of here.

02:32:11.300 --> 02:32:15.460
We will see you next time. Thank you so much for listening to our show tonight and participating,

uh, at OLR and all that good stuff throughout the week. And then we'll see you back here in

02:32:23.940 --> 02:32:30.100
seven days for another show until then. Good night. Bye. You've been listening to orange
