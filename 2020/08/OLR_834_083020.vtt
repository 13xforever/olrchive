This is deliberate misdirection from a deliberate choice, and it's a bad one.

00:24.060 --> 00:27.220
Privacy principles exist for a reason, and sites that hide significant detail behind

00:27.220 --> 00:29.460
some obnoxious agreement will fail faster.

00:29.460 --> 00:31.060
This is my 20 seconds of activism.

00:31.060 --> 00:34.600
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to carry on with the

00:34.600 --> 00:38.220
actual news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.220 --> 00:47.340
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

00:47.340 --> 00:49.300
every gamer has a voice.

00:49.300 --> 00:57.100
It is Orange Lounge Radio Live once again tonight with episode number 834 for this August

00:57.100 --> 00:59.020
the 30th of 2020.

00:59.020 --> 01:05.000
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm joined here as I usually am via the magic of Discord by

01:05.000 --> 01:06.980
DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:06.980 --> 01:07.980
Hello.

01:07.980 --> 01:08.980
Hi.

01:08.980 --> 01:09.980
How are you doing?

01:09.980 --> 01:10.980
I'm alright.

01:10.980 --> 01:11.980
Yeah.

01:11.980 --> 01:12.980
It's been quite a week.

01:12.980 --> 01:13.980
Yeah.

01:13.980 --> 01:17.980
It's been emotional and difficult.

01:17.980 --> 01:18.980
Absolutely.

01:18.980 --> 01:19.980
Absolutely.

01:19.980 --> 01:24.080
You know, and I think, you know, again, I know we talk about video games, but there's

01:24.080 --> 01:27.980
a lot of other stuff that happens in the world too, and right at the top of last week's show,

01:27.980 --> 01:31.700
we were kind of talking about the great loss that, you know, we were, you and I were feeling

01:31.700 --> 01:35.320
with the drag community and the loss of Chi Chi Devane, right?

01:35.320 --> 01:40.780
And now just, you know, days ago, we're getting this news about, you know, we lost Chadwick

01:40.780 --> 01:46.620
Boseman, which was a shock to obviously a lot of people because, you know, he had kept

01:46.620 --> 01:51.660
his illness and what he was battling for four years, a secret, which he had every right

01:51.660 --> 01:56.200
to do, obviously, and, you know, obviously, but now it's like you go back and you look

01:56.200 --> 01:59.740
at everything that he was doing with those movies and, you know, visiting the kids and

01:59.740 --> 02:03.840
the hospitals and everything, and just the stuff he was doing for, you know, the black

02:03.840 --> 02:09.460
community and, you know, the things he contributed to the Marvel universe and just everything

02:09.460 --> 02:10.860
he was doing.

02:10.860 --> 02:11.860
And he was battling that.

02:11.860 --> 02:12.860
He was the embodiment of representation.

02:12.860 --> 02:13.860
Mm-hmm.

02:13.860 --> 02:21.660
I mean, and he was the embodiment of like a good person and just to lose that is horrible.

02:21.660 --> 02:29.040
Not just as a black man, but also for invisible illnesses, because he did hide it very well.

02:29.040 --> 02:30.040
Yeah.

02:30.040 --> 02:31.040
There's a lot of us who are suffering.

02:31.040 --> 02:37.240
I mean, the same thing actually a few years ago happened with Liz Slaton of Doctor Who.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.020
She was Sarah Jane Smith.

02:39.020 --> 02:44.520
But I mean, of course, you know, the representation issue is not the same, but I'm saying that

02:44.520 --> 02:50.100
you shouldn't assume something about somebody because they appear to be able-bodied.

02:50.100 --> 02:56.440
You know, if someone says, I have this issue, just believe them and act accordingly.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.000
And he didn't even say anything.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.160
So that was, I don't know.

03:02.160 --> 03:04.800
Kelly Preston was another example of that as well.

03:04.800 --> 03:05.800
Yeah.

03:05.800 --> 03:06.800
Yeah.

03:06.800 --> 03:07.800
Yeah.

03:07.800 --> 03:09.080
Had passed away with battling cancer.

03:09.080 --> 03:13.780
So just a big, hearty fuck cancer here at the top of the show.

03:13.780 --> 03:16.240
And that's just such a tremendous loss.

03:16.240 --> 03:21.140
I mean, I can't claim to be the person that's there every weekend when a new Marvel movie

03:21.140 --> 03:22.540
opens.

03:22.540 --> 03:29.920
But at the same time, I do see like how Chadwick Boseman was so important to so many people.

03:29.920 --> 03:34.020
And it's just, this is a year.

03:34.020 --> 03:35.020
This is a year.

03:35.020 --> 03:37.060
I just, I don't know what else to say.

03:37.060 --> 03:38.380
All right.

03:38.380 --> 03:42.380
So the difficult transition to also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

03:42.380 --> 03:43.380
How are you?

03:43.380 --> 03:44.380
Hello.

03:44.380 --> 03:45.380
I'm fine.

03:45.520 --> 03:46.520
Say something funny.

03:46.520 --> 03:49.840
We've got to try to change the tone a little bit before we get into games.

03:49.840 --> 03:50.840
I know.

03:50.840 --> 03:53.480
How about that animal crossing stream we did earlier this week?

03:53.480 --> 03:54.480
That was a lot of fun.

03:54.480 --> 03:55.480
Right?

03:55.480 --> 03:56.480
Yeah.

03:56.480 --> 03:57.480
Yeah.

03:57.480 --> 03:58.480
I wasn't, you know, I had built that whole thing.

03:58.480 --> 03:59.560
It's like a Jamie and Rob show.

03:59.560 --> 04:02.480
I didn't know you would be as into it as you were.

04:02.480 --> 04:04.880
I didn't, uh, but it wasn't just you really.

04:04.880 --> 04:06.640
It was, you know, Nelly was in the background.

04:06.640 --> 04:09.480
You could hear her and your kid, one of your kids was there too.

04:09.480 --> 04:10.480
Yes.

04:10.480 --> 04:11.480
Yes.

04:11.480 --> 04:13.920
The two that actually play the game.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.360
We're kind of leading the tour.

04:16.340 --> 04:17.340
That stream was a lot of fun though.

04:17.340 --> 04:18.340
I'm glad we did it.

04:18.340 --> 04:21.580
Um, if you don't know what we're talking about, uh, of course, uh, we do, well, we taped this

04:21.580 --> 04:26.460
show orange launch radio live every week at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash

04:26.460 --> 04:31.100
a VOG network or VOG network Sunday nights at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern,

04:31.100 --> 04:32.500
right after the Bobby black Wolf show.

04:32.500 --> 04:38.260
But sometimes we do some other things on the network and this was one of those experimental

04:38.260 --> 04:39.260
things.

04:39.260 --> 04:41.380
So Thursday night we did like a special live show.

04:41.380 --> 04:43.860
Uh, and we, it was actually like two hours.

04:43.860 --> 04:48.840
We spent playing animal crossing and just looking at all the creativity on your guys's

04:48.840 --> 04:51.480
islands, uh, was, was really amazing.

04:51.480 --> 04:55.760
Uh, dark soccer, your Island is, is so cool.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.320
And um, thank you.

04:57.320 --> 05:01.080
And Loki yours is too, especially when you consider how much your kid contributed to

05:01.080 --> 05:04.680
that is, uh, you know, I kept joking like it's mostly Nelly.

05:04.680 --> 05:05.680
All right.

05:05.680 --> 05:09.400
Well, they said, don't, don't, don't sell the kids by the way.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.400
Oh, you're welcome.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.400
Yeah, no problem.

05:11.580 --> 05:12.580
And thank you for the stuff.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.500
Cause I got the posters and stuff afterwards.

05:14.500 --> 05:18.020
Anyway, I forgot what I was supposed to some Loki though, or what Nelly wanted.

05:18.020 --> 05:19.020
She wanted the fruit.

05:19.020 --> 05:24.860
We got her all up on the fruit and then, um, I don't remember.

05:24.860 --> 05:29.980
I know my son wanted like one of those like 3d wallpapers, either the space one or the

05:29.980 --> 05:31.220
spaceship one.

05:31.220 --> 05:33.660
I don't know how easy those are.

05:33.660 --> 05:38.020
Um, those are actually know that some of them I can make, I can make some of them.

05:38.020 --> 05:40.500
I think the star one is a Celeste pattern.

05:40.500 --> 05:41.680
I think it is.

05:41.680 --> 05:44.640
I have all of the Celeste patterns, so cool.

05:44.640 --> 05:50.600
So anyway, my wife's yelling to me, Oh, it's the wife placed in an order.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.600
Sorry.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.600
It's so funny.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.040
She wanted an omelet in the skillet.

05:56.040 --> 06:01.280
Oh, all you need to do is make the skillet and customize it.

06:01.280 --> 06:02.280
Oh yeah.

06:02.280 --> 06:03.280
The mega skill and customize it.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.280
Okay.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.280
Yeah.

06:05.280 --> 06:07.080
I have pizza in mine cause I have my pizza oven area.

06:07.080 --> 06:10.860
Anyway, if you want to hear two hours of this, if you're an animal crossing fan, it

06:10.860 --> 06:11.860
is in the archives.

06:11.860 --> 06:12.860
Oh yeah.

06:12.860 --> 06:13.860
We'll do it again.

06:13.860 --> 06:14.860
It's in the archive.

06:14.860 --> 06:16.620
And because this now we've shown all our islands.

06:16.620 --> 06:21.080
Now we get to show other people's islands and that, so that'll be fun.

06:21.080 --> 06:27.220
So anyway, to clarify act up, that's not my house that we showed off.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.220
That was my wife's house.

06:28.220 --> 06:31.620
My house is one single room and it has just a bunch of random garbage in there.

06:31.620 --> 06:33.540
Cause I don't really play the game.

06:33.540 --> 06:39.320
That was my wife's house with the interesting basement, which, which I don't think the kids

06:39.320 --> 06:41.120
were supposed to see.

06:41.120 --> 06:42.120
Anyway.

06:42.120 --> 06:43.120
All right.

06:43.120 --> 06:48.920
Uh, if you want to see that it is in the archives over at VOG network, uh, we're not going to

06:48.920 --> 06:52.280
be putting it out as a podcast cause it just relies so heavily on video.

06:52.280 --> 06:56.080
Um, so that is one of the getting, you could either watch it live when we did it, or if

06:56.080 --> 07:00.080
you want to go back in the video archives, um, subscribers, uh, at VOG network over on

07:00.080 --> 07:04.380
Twitch, get access to the complete video archive, which will, would include, um, the animal

07:04.380 --> 07:08.260
crossing special and any future specials, uh, that we do as well.

07:08.260 --> 07:12.900
And you can, uh, subscribe to VOG network using your free subscription that you get

07:12.900 --> 07:16.100
with prime gaming, formerly known as Twitch prime.

07:16.100 --> 07:21.180
You can use your free sub to subscribe right here at VOG network or, um, sub tempers coming

07:21.180 --> 07:22.180
up.

07:22.180 --> 07:24.580
And I think we have a story on it later in the show and it's going to make subscribing,

07:24.580 --> 07:27.140
um, even, even cheaper if you want to do it that way.

07:27.140 --> 07:28.140
We appreciate it.

07:28.140 --> 07:32.200
You don't have to, uh, but that is how you can access the video archive, um, on Twitch

07:32.200 --> 07:33.760
if you want to check that out.

07:33.760 --> 07:34.760
All right.

07:34.760 --> 07:38.460
So anyhow, let's get into some gaming news and, uh, kick off our show tonight with some

07:38.460 --> 07:43.280
talk about gamescom because, uh, uh, that was a big event that happened this week, even

07:43.280 --> 07:44.280
if it didn't happen in person.

07:44.280 --> 07:45.280
Right.

07:45.280 --> 07:46.280
Logie.

07:46.280 --> 07:47.280
Yes.

07:47.280 --> 07:48.820
So that was a pretty neat event.

07:48.820 --> 07:54.840
They had like kind of their kickoff live stream with Jeff Keeley showing off a bunch of trailers

07:54.840 --> 07:56.420
and talking about announcements and things.

07:56.420 --> 08:01.700
So some of the stuff they showed off this year, a new trailer for the Jurassic world

08:01.700 --> 08:02.700
evolution.

08:02.700 --> 08:09.760
Now coming to the switch, um, there was a, I don't remember if there's much gameplay,

08:09.760 --> 08:14.620
but there was a new trailer for call of duty, uh, black ops, cold war.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.480
And that's going to be coming out in November 13th.

08:16.480 --> 08:21.800
They showed the first game play of the upcoming expansion for doom eternal called the ancient

08:21.800 --> 08:24.200
gods part one.

08:24.200 --> 08:32.460
Um, they did a little tease for surgeon simulator two, which is out now, um, with, uh, doc Brown

08:32.460 --> 08:35.420
in there for some reason, I'm not really sure.

08:35.420 --> 08:38.540
Wait, wait, from like back to the future, doc Brown or back to the future.

08:38.540 --> 08:39.540
Yes.

08:39.540 --> 08:43.540
So I'm not really sure how that tied into it, but why not?

08:43.540 --> 08:44.540
Why not?

08:44.540 --> 08:47.260
But search and simulator is like a wacky game.

08:47.260 --> 08:51.100
Like the title makes it sounds, Oh, flight simulator.

08:51.100 --> 08:52.100
That's some serious business.

08:52.100 --> 08:55.800
The search and simulator is wacky, even worse.

08:55.800 --> 08:56.800
Yeah.

08:56.800 --> 09:00.800
Going back to call of duty, is it just me or does it look like Robert Redford?

09:00.800 --> 09:01.800
It does.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.360
And I was looking, I seriously, I was like, is that Robert Redford?

09:04.360 --> 09:07.080
Cause it it's down to the hair.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.080
It's absolutely Robert Redford.

09:08.080 --> 09:12.080
And I wouldn't be surprised if that's Robert Redford playing that part, but that's why

09:12.080 --> 09:13.080
I kept seeing the trailer.

09:13.080 --> 09:15.600
I was like, that is that Robert Redford?

09:15.600 --> 09:22.080
I even like, I actually pulled up a picture of him to, to make sure I'm like, Oh, maybe

09:22.660 --> 09:26.580
they use like hyper realistic license likenesses in those games.

09:26.580 --> 09:31.020
That's the same game that all the Ronald Reagan stuff that's showing up on Twitter is from,

09:31.020 --> 09:32.020
right?

09:32.020 --> 09:33.020
Yeah.

09:33.020 --> 09:34.020
Yeah.

09:34.020 --> 09:35.020
And yeah.

09:35.020 --> 09:38.960
And other celebrities in the past that may not have Greece, um, history also in those

09:38.960 --> 09:39.960
games.

09:39.960 --> 09:43.140
Um, but yeah, it definitely looks like Robert Redford.

09:43.140 --> 09:46.020
I would not be surprised if it's Robert Redford, they didn't.

09:46.020 --> 09:50.740
I would think that that was something that, um, if that was him, that they would kind

09:50.740 --> 09:54.640
of call that out being like, you know, Hey, we've got Robert Redford in this.

09:54.640 --> 09:59.400
Um, but cause, you know, gamers love Robert Redford.

09:59.400 --> 10:03.960
I know if we, if we were to pull our chat and ask like top three celebrities, go heaven

10:03.960 --> 10:06.480
spacey because that was a thing.

10:06.480 --> 10:10.880
So yeah, but look at, look at what we had for death stranding, you know, going back

10:10.880 --> 10:17.160
to our, our, uh, you know, seventies and eighties famous actors, you know, true.

10:17.160 --> 10:20.180
And contemporary cause you know, obviously walking dead is huge.

10:20.180 --> 10:21.180
Yeah.

10:21.180 --> 10:22.180
But yeah.

10:22.180 --> 10:23.180
Uh, search and see me later too, though.

10:23.180 --> 10:24.180
It looks like a lot of fun.

10:24.180 --> 10:28.260
It's co-op this time and there's a lot of like running around and doing things and severing

10:28.260 --> 10:31.500
arms and stuff to like get to other rooms and things.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.580
It looks really crazy.

10:32.580 --> 10:34.140
So it, that'll be fun too.

10:34.140 --> 10:39.680
That's not VR, but, um, soon probably at some point, uh, they showed some behind the scenes

10:39.680 --> 10:43.140
of the new dragon age game, uh, is really just a bunch of like concept art.

10:43.140 --> 10:46.780
So I have no idea what the heck this game is going to look like, but it's already out

10:47.400 --> 10:48.760
Why don't you defer to Jamie?

10:48.760 --> 10:57.080
There's a new salmon max VR game that they've, uh, were teasing.

10:57.080 --> 10:58.480
So I'm all about that.

10:58.480 --> 11:04.800
Um, as you can see by my background, um, they did a trailer for the new world of Warcraft

11:04.800 --> 11:09.640
expansion shadow lands, which looks like world of Warcraft.

11:09.640 --> 11:10.640
Yeah.

11:10.640 --> 11:16.540
Not, uh, not really a fan of that series, so I'm sure it's important to somebody, um,

11:16.540 --> 11:20.200
they talked a little bit about crash four with some of the gameplay elements for that.

11:20.200 --> 11:25.600
They shut off a trailer for little nightmares two, which looks pretty darn creepy.

11:25.600 --> 11:30.080
Um, showed a little bit more of the VR gameplay from star Wars squadrons.

11:30.080 --> 11:35.020
Uh, they have a star Wars themed expansion for the Sims four.

11:35.020 --> 11:36.020
That looks pretty cool.

11:36.020 --> 11:37.080
Did you watch the trailer?

11:37.080 --> 11:39.200
I missed the trailer for that one.

11:39.200 --> 11:43.360
Unfortunately, it might be enough to get me back into Sims four.

11:43.360 --> 11:44.360
It looked pretty cool.

11:44.360 --> 11:47.500
Uh, they showed off a new trailer for mafia, the definitive edition, which looks pretty

11:47.500 --> 11:48.500
cool.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.460
I'd never played the original games, but I heard they're pretty good.

11:50.460 --> 11:55.580
Um, Lego star Wars, the Skywalker saga, um, which looks pretty nice.

11:55.580 --> 11:59.340
I have never really played the Lego star Wars games, but I played all the other ones, so

11:59.340 --> 12:00.340
why not?

12:00.340 --> 12:05.660
Uh, they show fall guy season two, kind of a sneak peek of what the new courses are.

12:05.660 --> 12:11.140
Um, they have a little bit of a, a little bit of a, a little bit of a, a, a, a, a, a

12:11.140 --> 12:15.840
season two kind of a sneak peek of what the new courses and, uh, themes are going to be.

12:15.840 --> 12:17.120
It's all medieval themes.

12:17.120 --> 12:22.480
So they have new costumes and courses based around that, uh, new VR medal of honor game

12:22.480 --> 12:26.520
from respawn, a medal of honor above and beyond, which looks pretty cool.

12:26.520 --> 12:31.720
Uh, um, destiny beyond light.

12:31.720 --> 12:36.600
I mean, I'm surprised that does seem to still going, uh, well, it's, it's making that huge

12:36.600 --> 12:38.020
shift to free to play.

12:38.020 --> 12:41.100
Um, and there's other big shifts that are coming with the game.

12:41.100 --> 12:42.940
I, well, I already own it.

12:42.940 --> 12:46.700
I mean, so like the free to play doesn't really change things, but I am kind of curious to

12:46.700 --> 12:47.740
check it out again.

12:47.740 --> 12:52.080
I know the free to play transitions have been somewhat controversial, like the archiving

12:52.080 --> 12:53.840
of the old contents, a little weird.

12:53.840 --> 12:57.420
I am curious to check out the game again in its current state.

12:57.420 --> 12:58.420
I do.

12:58.420 --> 13:03.740
There's, you know, I don't play a lot of shooters, but I did enjoy destiny, you know, and what's,

13:03.740 --> 13:04.980
what's interesting.

13:05.000 --> 13:11.640
Do you guys remember, um, pre pandemic and it was probably January of 2019, um, here

13:11.640 --> 13:16.560
at OLR studios, we had all the, um, the women of ingress, the mobile phone game I played,

13:16.560 --> 13:17.560
maybe it was 2018.

13:17.560 --> 13:18.560
It was a while ago.

13:18.560 --> 13:20.560
We had, we had all those gals here in studio, right.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.400
That I'll play ingress mobile.

13:22.400 --> 13:23.400
Okay.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.160
Like a ton of them now play destiny.

13:25.160 --> 13:27.840
Well, they still play ingress, but they play destiny too.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.560
And they've been trying to get me to play with them except they play destiny too on

13:30.560 --> 13:33.960
X-Box and I'll have it on X-Box.

13:33.960 --> 13:37.900
Well, can't you play cross-play though with like other systems, like the very least the

13:37.900 --> 13:39.020
PC version?

13:39.020 --> 13:43.920
I think there is that, but we have the game pass version coming out soon anyway.

13:43.920 --> 13:47.660
So that's what I'm going to just wait for is when destiny two's on game pass and then

13:47.660 --> 13:51.540
I can play with them and they can carry me cause they're probably all super high levels

13:51.540 --> 13:52.560
and stuff.

13:52.560 --> 13:56.820
So I just thought it was interesting that destiny two was the game they all got sucked

13:56.820 --> 13:58.580
into in their spare time.

13:58.580 --> 13:59.580
Yeah.

14:00.360 --> 14:04.880
Some other neat trailers that they had, they showed off a new trailer for 12 minutes, which

14:04.880 --> 14:09.160
was that kind of I don't even know how to describe it.

14:09.160 --> 14:14.680
It's like a weird, like a drama type game where you're going to be attacked or something

14:14.680 --> 14:19.400
by some intruders, but they've got a lot of, it's like a time loop game, but they've got

14:19.400 --> 14:21.380
a really cool cast in it.

14:21.380 --> 14:25.000
So Daisy Ridley, James McAvoy and William Defoe.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.760
So awesome.

14:27.760 --> 14:28.960
That looks cool.

14:28.960 --> 14:36.100
And then they showed off some new trailers for Outriders, which looks interesting Spellbreak,

14:36.100 --> 14:42.980
Age of Empires three, definitive edition, Godfall, which the more they show that I just

14:42.980 --> 14:48.300
really don't care WWE battlegrounds.

14:48.300 --> 14:52.980
Why would the big head mode, like, like you can do an arcade game, like NBA Jam or something

14:52.980 --> 14:55.300
like that without everybody having giant heads.

14:55.300 --> 14:56.300
It looks weird.

14:56.300 --> 15:01.720
Um, so yeah, that was pretty much it.

15:01.720 --> 15:03.680
So what did you think overall of it?

15:03.680 --> 15:07.080
I don't know, it was nothing like huge and exciting.

15:07.080 --> 15:11.120
There's like, I mean, there was some like interesting announcements, but it wasn't like

15:11.120 --> 15:14.000
blowing my, you know, blowing me away.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.160
It was just kind of like, oh yeah, you know, cool VR, Sam, Max, and the rest I could just

15:19.160 --> 15:22.200
kind of do without, I mean, I don't know.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.720
Um, I'm just like, whatever for VR.

15:24.720 --> 15:28.340
I was a little excited to see some of the prelims for Dragon Age four, but that's really

15:28.340 --> 15:29.780
about it for me.

15:29.780 --> 15:30.780
It's very good.

15:30.780 --> 15:31.780
Like underwhelming.

15:31.780 --> 15:33.580
I think they didn't really have like some really huge announcements.

15:33.580 --> 15:38.660
I'm assuming that a lot of the, um, whereas we would have gotten probably a lot more announcements

15:38.660 --> 15:44.220
from the big three, um, during one of these types of events, but being that we're in like

15:44.220 --> 15:49.920
pandemic mode here, that everybody who's been doing their own like digital events and they've

15:49.920 --> 15:51.340
been announcing everything there.

15:51.340 --> 15:56.040
So I think this is kind of like the leftover scraps, which is fine because there's a lot

15:56.040 --> 16:01.120
of like other companies that can, you know, show off their games that might not necessarily,

16:01.120 --> 16:08.600
you know, be highlighted in one of those, um, it was okay.

16:08.600 --> 16:13.280
I guess I, they, I know they were streaming like for three days, like showing different

16:13.280 --> 16:15.680
things, but I didn't catch any of the other footage.

16:15.680 --> 16:19.980
So like, I couldn't tell you if there's any, I don't think there was any other announcements,

16:19.980 --> 16:23.500
but I don't know.

16:23.500 --> 16:24.500
It is what it is.

16:24.500 --> 16:25.500
Um, yeah.

16:25.500 --> 16:29.160
I mean, it was, it was a little, I, it was both kind of like a bad thing and a good thing

16:29.160 --> 16:34.880
that like there was nothing like Sony or Microsoft, like kind of first party in those because

16:34.880 --> 16:37.560
obviously they want to do their own things.

16:37.560 --> 16:41.440
And both those companies are probably feeling the pressure of, they're going to have to

16:41.440 --> 16:44.680
announce that date and price pretty darn soon here.

16:44.680 --> 16:49.520
Or I don't already do them pre-orders I mean, or they're starting pre-orders in these systems

16:49.520 --> 16:50.520
already.

16:50.520 --> 16:54.260
So it's like, well, well, if you're talking about the Sony thing, cause that's like a,

16:54.260 --> 16:58.460
it's a pre pre-order cause cause pre-orders aren't enough anymore.

16:58.460 --> 16:59.460
Low key.

16:59.460 --> 17:00.460
No, no, no, no, no.

17:00.460 --> 17:05.700
In the year 2020 we have pre pre-orders, which you, which literally is you're entering a

17:05.700 --> 17:10.580
raffle to get the opportunity to pre-order a PlayStation five.

17:10.580 --> 17:15.080
You know, as, as much as I'm being a SAS master on this whole thing, I actually kind of get

17:15.080 --> 17:19.340
it because I think what they're doing is really trying to go the extra mile to prevent scalper

17:19.340 --> 17:20.340
burrs.

17:20.340 --> 17:23.760
And from that viewpoint, I'm actually very appreciative.

17:23.760 --> 17:26.960
So hype is what I'm thinking they're trying to do.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.280
Like, I don't think it's scalpers necessarily.

17:29.280 --> 17:33.360
It could be part that, but it, what, what it is having that effect that it's going to

17:33.360 --> 17:35.280
be a lot harder for scalpers to get them.

17:35.280 --> 17:40.520
And for that I'm thankful, um, bar none, but yeah, it's kind of like, where is the fricking

17:40.520 --> 17:41.560
price and date?

17:41.560 --> 17:45.640
Now we're starting to get into that whole, okay, we we've been giving them plenty of

17:45.640 --> 17:49.200
time, but times like if these things are releasing in November.

17:50.060 --> 17:56.140
Well, we got a bunch of people, the, so the rumor is, um, just making sure we don't have

17:56.140 --> 17:57.740
said rumor in our story.

17:57.740 --> 18:02.460
Uh, so the rumor is that they're going to start pre-orders on the PlayStation, uh, five

18:02.460 --> 18:08.780
on September 9th, because it's the anniversary of the original PlayStation is the rumor.

18:08.780 --> 18:14.820
So I guess we only have a, you know, a couple more weeks to see if that's true or not.

18:14.820 --> 18:15.820
Yeah.

18:15.880 --> 18:20.280
By the time OLR is back, uh, because we will be, we won't be here next week.

18:20.280 --> 18:21.920
We'll talk a little more about that in a minute.

18:21.920 --> 18:24.400
Um, but it'll be after September 9th.

18:24.400 --> 18:29.120
So I got to see the price too, like, cause, cause you know, there's people, I mean, obviously

18:29.120 --> 18:32.780
there's nothing really substantiated yet, but like, there's like talk that some of these

18:32.780 --> 18:38.860
systems are going to be over a thousand dollars, like, nope, um, not happening.

18:38.860 --> 18:43.600
She-Hulk 10 in chat, uh, says delayed 2021 COVID.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.220
You know, you're certainly not the first to say that.

18:46.220 --> 18:49.820
And I think there was a big Kotaku article that was written up on the subject about,

18:49.820 --> 18:52.980
you know, what should, should they just wait till next year at this point?

18:52.980 --> 18:56.060
And I know, and I should have just invited him back to sit with us again, uh, on the

18:56.060 --> 18:57.060
show.

18:57.060 --> 19:01.060
But, uh, my buddy Delvin, VGRealness had brought this up in one of our chats is that I just

19:01.060 --> 19:04.060
like just fucking delay them to next year already.

19:04.060 --> 19:07.340
Like this, this year is, is shit.

19:07.340 --> 19:12.220
Just let it go down the drain and let's just try to focus on making next year bigger.

19:12.240 --> 19:15.880
And that would include the consoles, just put them out next year at this point.

19:15.880 --> 19:20.200
Um, and I, I have to kind of admit points were made.

19:20.200 --> 19:28.640
Like, I, I don't know if I'm super into, like, I need to have these consoles this year.

19:28.640 --> 19:32.040
When this year started, I definitely thought that, but just with everything that we've

19:32.040 --> 19:35.760
all been through this year, I'm kind of at the point where I'm like, I kind of think

19:35.760 --> 19:38.480
I'm only going to end up getting one or the other this year and I'm going to wait till

19:38.480 --> 19:39.480
next year.

19:40.340 --> 19:43.580
Which is fine too.

19:43.580 --> 19:48.020
Who has the best launch games because, you know, that's really what it comes down to.

19:48.020 --> 19:53.420
And now, you know, other rumors out there about other enhancements coming, um, you know,

19:53.420 --> 19:57.060
maybe I get one of those so I can actually have a console to play on.

19:57.060 --> 19:58.060
Yeah.

19:58.060 --> 20:01.540
My family isn't monopolizing, but, um, yeah, I don't know.

20:01.540 --> 20:08.740
I was, uh, both are kind of expensive like right now I think, but because I'm not taking

20:08.800 --> 20:13.720
my family out every weekend, I can kind of afford to announce, I guess it'd be fine.

20:13.720 --> 20:17.640
Let me, let me, let me ask an impromptu question of our chat room because we are the show where

20:17.640 --> 20:18.680
every gamer has a voice.

20:18.680 --> 20:21.620
I want to hear specifically your guys' voices on this.

20:21.620 --> 20:27.880
What would be your reaction if next week it hits the media, Sony and Microsoft, both just

20:27.880 --> 20:33.460
coincidentally back to back, same day, whatever they both announce, um, due to the pandemic,

20:33.460 --> 20:38.320
due to, you know, whatever they say, we're going to push back these releases 2021.

20:38.320 --> 20:43.280
We're going to push back the release of both these systems to let's say March, 2021.

20:43.280 --> 20:45.920
They're going to try to still squeeze in the same fiscal year.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.960
How would you feel?

20:47.960 --> 20:49.360
Just kind of throwing that out there.

20:49.360 --> 20:51.600
I'm really curious to hear how the chatters might feel.

20:51.600 --> 20:52.700
Would you be relieved?

20:52.700 --> 20:57.040
Cause it's like, Oh, I've got more time to, would you feel, would you feel a little sad

20:57.040 --> 21:01.580
because you were really hoping like, Oh, I kind of need, I needed something to look forward

21:01.580 --> 21:03.720
to during all this and now it's being delayed.

21:03.720 --> 21:05.080
Like I'm really curious.

21:05.080 --> 21:06.080
Um, okay.

21:06.080 --> 21:11.440
So looking in chat, you guys are quick, uh, she Hulk says sad, but better to do it right

21:11.440 --> 21:13.480
than fast and broken.

21:13.480 --> 21:17.320
Insert that famous line about a good game is, or a bad game is bad forever and that

21:17.320 --> 21:18.320
whole thing.

21:18.320 --> 21:19.320
Right?

21:19.320 --> 21:20.320
Uh, Bobby Blackwell says, I'd be fine.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.320
As join her.

21:21.320 --> 21:22.320
Matt says, I'd be fine.

21:22.320 --> 21:23.760
Pixel pocket says, I wouldn't mind.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.140
Did your MS says, doesn't bother me.

21:26.140 --> 21:30.120
So I'm here, you know, that's only five people in chat, but still I'm hearing a resounding

21:30.120 --> 21:38.080
kind of seems to be the verdict, you know, that's all I need is cyberpunk.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.160
So it's all good.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.600
But cyberpunk is going to be on the current Jen.

21:41.600 --> 21:45.560
So it doesn't like that's also going to be on the other one and I'm getting on PC.

21:45.560 --> 21:48.560
So, you know, it's fine.

21:48.560 --> 21:49.560
I have that.

21:49.560 --> 21:52.360
I have that regardless of, um, whatever they put out.

21:52.360 --> 21:57.200
So the rest is gravy, I guess Bobby Blackwell says, don't you dare delay

21:57.200 --> 21:59.520
a Nintendo direct one minute longer.

21:59.920 --> 22:07.640
I'm glad someone went against the grain here fifth dream says, I'd be mad.

22:07.640 --> 22:09.520
My job is tenuous right now.

22:09.520 --> 22:12.720
Ironically, I will have it probably until COVID is over.

22:12.720 --> 22:13.720
So I need them now.

22:13.720 --> 22:17.960
So I can buy PlayStation five before my job poofs, LOL.

22:17.960 --> 22:23.460
So maybe one of those, like it actually works out in my budget and everybody's financial

22:23.460 --> 22:28.360
situation is different, but it works better for me to budget the money to get it now,

22:28.400 --> 22:31.600
as opposed to budgeting the money to get it later, which isn't one you hear often.

22:31.600 --> 22:35.400
But again, your financial situation, not mine, everybody's is different.

22:35.400 --> 22:40.680
So anyway, thank you for indulging me there with the question there, because I'm just

22:40.680 --> 22:44.320
kind of curious, I'm kind of curious if that would be, you know, our listener is one subset

22:44.320 --> 22:45.320
of gamers.

22:45.320 --> 22:49.420
I'm kind of curious what the general reaction on Twitter would be if that that and social

22:49.420 --> 22:53.320
media, I mean, Twitter to represent all social media with the representation would be if

22:53.320 --> 22:57.520
they announced that because I feel like there are a lot of people that would be like, oh,

22:57.520 --> 22:58.520
this sucks.

22:58.520 --> 23:03.440
But at the same time, I also kind of feel like that might be the easy comment to make.

23:03.440 --> 23:09.440
But there would be a lot of people that would just be like, yeah, tell me something else.

23:09.440 --> 23:10.440
Right.

23:10.440 --> 23:15.760
Hell, we already if I did slip my mind while I was going over this, but we've already had

23:15.760 --> 23:20.520
one console slip their launch into 2021 and television amico.

23:20.520 --> 23:28.740
I realize that probably isn't on people's radar in the same way that PS5 and Xbox Series

23:28.740 --> 23:32.640
X are, but some people are looking forward to that.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.560
It's a different audience.

23:34.560 --> 23:35.920
And that slipped to next year.

23:35.920 --> 23:40.840
And I think, you know, I'm somebody that preordered an Intellivision and I was also one of the

23:40.840 --> 23:43.860
people that went, eh, am I surprised?

23:43.860 --> 23:44.860
Not really.

23:44.860 --> 23:47.400
Sad, but understandable.

23:47.400 --> 23:48.400
And that's that.

23:48.400 --> 23:49.400
So.

23:49.400 --> 23:50.400
All right.

23:50.400 --> 23:51.400
Anyhow.

23:51.400 --> 23:52.400
Um.

23:52.400 --> 23:53.400
Let's see.

23:53.400 --> 23:57.840
DJ Rama says not to sound like a downer, but let me be real with you, 2020 kind of broke

23:57.840 --> 23:58.840
me mentally.

23:58.840 --> 24:02.400
So if the next gen consoles were canceled, I'd be a bit upset about it only because I

24:02.400 --> 24:06.320
understand why that bit would have been me really wanting it.

24:06.320 --> 24:07.720
No, I totally get it.

24:07.720 --> 24:09.280
I totally get it.

24:09.280 --> 24:15.720
And I'm sorry to hear about that, but I mean, like the good news for this earth and I hope

24:15.720 --> 24:19.400
this doesn't sound like I'm trying to lessen what you said because I'm absolutely not doing

24:19.400 --> 24:20.400
that.

24:20.400 --> 24:27.080
But a lot of us are feeling like what else is going to happen in 2020.

24:27.080 --> 24:31.120
So vent, my friend, because you are in good company.

24:31.120 --> 24:33.920
I guess that's kind of my point.

24:33.920 --> 24:34.920
Anyhow.

24:34.920 --> 24:38.680
Bobby Blackwell says the Commodore 64 releases in November.

24:38.680 --> 24:40.920
The full sized version of that releases in November.

24:40.920 --> 24:43.280
That's your new console for 2020.

24:43.280 --> 24:47.360
And Pod Culture says, I wish Amazon would restock the TurboGrafx-16 mini.

24:47.360 --> 24:48.960
I didn't realize that was running low.

24:48.960 --> 24:52.600
I mean, that's just because I got one early, but.

24:52.600 --> 24:59.120
So one funny thing, though, like I recently picked up a Nest Mini because Nintendo selling

24:59.120 --> 25:02.320
the refurbished ones for less than what they were retailing for before.

25:02.320 --> 25:06.240
So you don't have to buy them at scalper prices and they're in stock.

25:06.240 --> 25:07.240
Hmm.

25:07.240 --> 25:09.320
OK, that's good.

25:09.320 --> 25:10.320
We don't like scalpers.

25:10.320 --> 25:11.320
$49.99.

25:11.320 --> 25:12.320
All right.

25:12.360 --> 25:13.360
All right.

25:13.360 --> 25:16.480
Well, I think that's all I'll say about Gamescom for now.

25:16.480 --> 25:20.120
It was, you know, it's nice to get some updates and especially, you know, even if the big

25:20.120 --> 25:24.420
players weren't there, there's a lot of other companies that make games work.

25:24.420 --> 25:26.400
So it was cool to get some updates from them.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.400
So.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.400
All right.

25:28.400 --> 25:31.720
Let's move on to our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing

25:31.720 --> 25:32.720
this week.

25:32.720 --> 25:35.640
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

25:35.640 --> 25:37.000
A little bit uneventful.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.360
I was playing Animal Crossing and wordscapes.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.840
Wordscapes is I actually because I believe it or not, I beat the other word game that

25:46.840 --> 25:49.840
I was playing.

25:49.840 --> 25:54.240
All fifteen hundred levels of it.

25:54.240 --> 25:56.920
So wordscapes is a little bit harder.

25:56.920 --> 25:59.720
It's got a bigger dictionary to it, so I'm enjoying it a bit more.

25:59.720 --> 26:02.240
I'm also playing words with friends.

26:02.240 --> 26:06.560
I really have just been I have so much going on because I had a doctor's visit and I had

26:06.560 --> 26:10.480
to get my eyes checked and I had so much going on this last week.

26:10.480 --> 26:12.880
Also next week is my anniversary.

26:12.880 --> 26:16.720
So Dan and I have been married for 15 years.

26:16.720 --> 26:24.240
So we're probably going to, you know, just stay and play classic games all day and eat

26:24.240 --> 26:25.240
sushi.

26:25.240 --> 26:26.240
We'll see.

26:26.240 --> 26:27.240
Well, congratulations on that landmark.

26:27.240 --> 26:28.240
It's a big number.

26:28.240 --> 26:29.240
Thank you.

26:29.240 --> 26:30.240
We were supposed to be in New Orleans.

26:30.240 --> 26:31.240
I know.

26:31.240 --> 26:32.240
Oops.

26:32.240 --> 26:33.240
But 2020.

26:33.240 --> 26:34.240
Yeah.

26:34.240 --> 26:35.240
Yeah, whatever.

26:35.240 --> 26:36.240
Whoopty shit.

26:36.240 --> 26:37.240
2020.

26:37.240 --> 26:38.240
All right.

26:38.240 --> 26:41.520
Well, that's it for your gaming week.

26:41.520 --> 26:42.520
Let's talk to Loki.

26:42.520 --> 26:43.520
How was your gaming week?

26:43.520 --> 26:46.680
So my gaming week was pretty uneventful.

26:46.680 --> 26:51.520
I played a few things, a little bit of Animal Crossing because of the live stream.

26:51.520 --> 26:59.920
I played a little bit of Zelda Breath of the Wild because my son kept wanting me to help

26:59.920 --> 27:04.200
him with different things.

27:04.200 --> 27:09.800
And the rest was just kind of messing around with game dev stuff, not really getting very

27:09.800 --> 27:10.800
far.

27:10.800 --> 27:11.800
Yeah.

27:11.800 --> 27:12.800
I saw that little screenshot on your Twitter.

27:12.800 --> 27:13.800
What was that all about?

27:13.800 --> 27:14.800
Yeah.

27:14.800 --> 27:15.800
That was just without context.

27:15.800 --> 27:16.800
Sorry.

27:16.800 --> 27:17.800
Okay.

27:17.800 --> 27:18.800
All right.

27:18.800 --> 27:19.800
It's going to be like that.

27:19.800 --> 27:20.800
All right.

27:20.800 --> 27:21.800
All right.

27:21.800 --> 27:22.800
Let me talk about my gaming week.

27:22.800 --> 27:23.800
So I've been playing a lot of the same old stuff.

27:23.800 --> 27:24.800
Final Fantasy 14.

27:24.800 --> 27:26.720
Y'all saw the Animal Crossing thing earlier this week.

27:26.720 --> 27:29.960
I've also been playing Pokemon Go, but I'll talk a little more about that with one of

27:29.960 --> 27:32.640
our news items coming up later.

27:32.640 --> 27:34.360
And I played some other stuff too.

27:34.360 --> 27:41.720
So speaking of Pokemon, I actually, since I still use the Poke Ball Plus and with Pokemon

27:41.720 --> 27:45.360
Shield, Sword and Shield of course, but I have Shield.

27:45.360 --> 27:50.160
So with Pokemon Shield, you can transfer a Pokemon into the ball, although you're not

27:50.160 --> 27:53.240
really like, you're not losing it from your party or anything.

27:53.240 --> 27:56.680
You put a Pokemon in your Poke Ball Plus and then you can go out and catch Pokemon with

27:56.680 --> 27:59.560
it and you get rewards in the main game.

27:59.560 --> 28:03.720
Well, I had put some Pokemon in there like a month ago and I'd been playing Pokemon Go

28:03.720 --> 28:08.760
like Go Fest, Community Day, all this stuff.

28:08.760 --> 28:12.880
And I finally synced my Pokemon back over to Pokemon Shield.

28:12.880 --> 28:18.360
Apparently I had collected about 10,000 Pokemon in the time.

28:18.360 --> 28:23.600
That's how long it had been since I had loaded the, whoops, loaded the file back over.

28:23.600 --> 28:28.120
So when it gave me rewards, it gave me 97 rare candy.

28:28.120 --> 28:33.560
If you don't know what a rare candy does, you instantly gain one level on your Pokemon.

28:33.560 --> 28:39.660
So if you're catching Pokemon at level 60, you give it 39 candy and it's level 99.

28:39.660 --> 28:42.200
You know, so it's like, that was a lot of rare candy.

28:42.200 --> 28:44.080
I got 97 rare candies.

28:44.080 --> 28:48.760
So anyway, long story short, I decided maybe I need to like pick up Pokemon Shield again

28:48.760 --> 28:50.520
because I beat the game.

28:50.520 --> 28:54.680
I beat it when it came out, which, you know, again, I'd never beaten a mainline Pokemon

28:54.680 --> 28:55.680
game before.

28:56.680 --> 29:01.760
But I didn't get through the post game because every Pokemon game has the, after you become

29:01.760 --> 29:05.760
the champion and beat the Elite Four or whatever the game's equivalent is, now you have to

29:05.760 --> 29:08.140
go catch the legendary from the box art.

29:08.140 --> 29:09.400
And so that's what I did.

29:09.400 --> 29:14.720
And earlier today, or maybe it was yet, no, it was earlier today, I beat the end game

29:14.720 --> 29:17.600
component of Pokemon Shield and caught my Zamzata.

29:17.600 --> 29:19.200
So hooray.

29:19.200 --> 29:20.200
So I did that.

29:20.200 --> 29:23.880
So now I'm ready maybe for the DLC, but I kind of need to flesh out my Pokedex still,

29:23.880 --> 29:24.880
I think.

29:24.880 --> 29:28.760
But that was fun to revisit Pokemon Shield because I hadn't played it in literally months.

29:28.760 --> 29:31.720
It's still a great Pokemon game.

29:31.720 --> 29:36.440
And then another new game, let's shift gears a little bit here because this is a big change.

29:36.440 --> 29:42.080
So I picked this one up on a PlayStation sale and it was one of those games that I've heard

29:42.080 --> 29:43.080
a lot about.

29:43.080 --> 29:47.080
And I think from some of you guys in chat have actually been kind of nudging me towards

29:47.080 --> 29:48.080
this game.

29:48.080 --> 29:53.840
So I picked up a game on the recent PlayStation sale called Telling Lies is the name of the

29:53.840 --> 29:54.840
game.

29:54.840 --> 30:02.560
So Telling Lies is from the same creators and like creative minds behind Her Story,

30:02.560 --> 30:06.280
which was out like three or four years ago.

30:06.280 --> 30:10.040
And a lot of the game is based in full motion video.

30:10.040 --> 30:17.400
In fact, I almost feel a little weird calling this a game at the end of the day.

30:17.400 --> 30:18.400
It's a game.

30:18.400 --> 30:19.400
Don't get me wrong.

30:19.400 --> 30:26.000
You know, because some people try to dismiss walking simulators, something like Dearest.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Was that like a Dearest?

30:27.000 --> 30:29.560
Was that the game that yeah.

30:29.560 --> 30:31.160
Some people try to write that off.

30:31.160 --> 30:32.440
What was it?

30:32.440 --> 30:33.440
Something about the rapture.

30:33.440 --> 30:34.440
Yeah.

30:34.440 --> 30:35.440
Oh, everybody's gone to the rapture.

30:35.440 --> 30:36.440
Yeah.

30:36.440 --> 30:37.440
Yeah.

30:37.440 --> 30:39.960
Some people try to write off those walking simulators as not games.

30:39.960 --> 30:40.960
They're games.

30:40.960 --> 30:42.480
Those are beautiful.

30:42.480 --> 30:49.880
But I would say that Telling Lies was a little more adjacent to like the Bandersnatch episode

30:49.880 --> 30:58.000
of Black Mirror on Netflix and that kind of game where it's not so much like push X as

30:58.000 --> 31:04.840
fast as you can or solve this puzzle, but it's kind of like a different way of exploring

31:04.840 --> 31:06.640
a story.

31:06.640 --> 31:08.880
And I really enjoyed it.

31:08.880 --> 31:12.240
I really enjoyed it.

31:12.240 --> 31:14.920
But the biggest like.

31:14.920 --> 31:17.360
So let me talk about the strings, because there's a lot of strings.

31:17.360 --> 31:20.200
I want to if I want to get in the negative, I'm going to make it sound like, oh, my God,

31:20.200 --> 31:21.200
I'm slamming on this game.

31:21.200 --> 31:22.200
I'm really not.

31:22.200 --> 31:26.280
The positives are the acting performances in this game are really good.

31:26.280 --> 31:30.300
There's four main characters in the game.

31:30.300 --> 31:32.760
There's one man and three women.

31:32.760 --> 31:35.240
And one of the women looked really familiar to me.

31:35.240 --> 31:39.240
I think she's Storm now in the X-Men series.

31:39.240 --> 31:46.520
He's in this and the guy didn't look familiar to me at all, but he is really good in this

31:46.520 --> 31:47.520
game.

31:47.520 --> 31:50.860
And in fact, all the all the acting is is really top notch, because what's interesting,

31:50.860 --> 31:55.760
this game probably could have been made in the 90s when full motion video games like

31:55.760 --> 31:58.000
Night Trap were getting started.

31:58.000 --> 32:05.200
But like the production value and the acting and a lot of those early games were not great.

32:05.200 --> 32:06.440
Right.

32:06.440 --> 32:13.320
But now in this like this is like you're watching a Netflix show, but you're also like participating

32:13.320 --> 32:14.320
in.

32:14.320 --> 32:15.320
So here's the mechanic.

32:15.320 --> 32:20.720
Basically, you're playing like a character that is watching surveillance footage and

32:20.720 --> 32:26.680
you're going through surveillance footage and the game starts so that the very first

32:26.680 --> 32:29.360
thing you search for is the word love.

32:29.360 --> 32:34.720
So you will get the first five video clips because search limits are maxed at five that

32:34.720 --> 32:40.480
have the word love in them and you watch the clip and then maybe the character will

32:40.480 --> 32:43.560
say something and you're like, I want to know more about that.

32:43.560 --> 32:44.560
Maybe.

32:44.560 --> 32:47.900
OK, so this character just mentioned somebody named Ava.

32:47.900 --> 32:48.900
Who's Ava?

32:48.900 --> 32:50.120
I'm going to search for Ava.

32:50.120 --> 32:55.080
Now I'll get five conversations where Ava is mentioned first word chronologically.

32:55.080 --> 32:57.080
And that is basically the game.

32:57.080 --> 33:02.300
You're choosing a path based on what you want to hear more about.

33:02.300 --> 33:08.040
And it gets very clever because there are lots of different things you could be exploring.

33:08.040 --> 33:11.140
There are several storylines embedded in the game.

33:11.140 --> 33:18.540
And it's actually just what it must have taken to write a game like this is really brilliant.

33:18.540 --> 33:22.300
And so I absolutely think it's something worth your time.

33:22.300 --> 33:24.600
Jamie, I think you'd like this.

33:24.600 --> 33:28.460
I don't know why, but I just think like this is the type of thing I think maybe because

33:28.460 --> 33:35.540
it is just so much like a narrative and so like story driven where you're not like, there's

33:35.540 --> 33:38.820
not like a lot of pressure on you to do like, I just feel like it's something you might

33:38.820 --> 33:39.820
really enjoy to.

33:39.820 --> 33:44.420
So I'll be sure to check it out, just link me so I don't forget.

33:44.420 --> 33:45.420
Yeah, no worries.

33:45.420 --> 33:49.860
So I'm curious if any of you in chat have played it telling lies.

33:49.860 --> 33:55.980
OK, so let me tell you the one negative I have, because it is something that is presented

33:55.980 --> 33:57.540
on the PlayStation four.

33:57.540 --> 33:59.360
This game is also out on PC.

33:59.360 --> 34:00.820
It was out there first.

34:00.820 --> 34:05.500
And those computing platforms, I believe it's on mobile phone, iOS, Android.

34:05.500 --> 34:07.320
It was there last year as well.

34:07.320 --> 34:12.460
It just came out for PS4, Switch, maybe Xbox, probably Xbox.

34:12.460 --> 34:13.460
It just came out.

34:13.460 --> 34:14.460
I think I'm going to be getting it on Steam.

34:14.460 --> 34:19.040
Yeah, it just came out on all of that a couple like weeks ago.

34:19.040 --> 34:21.460
So or no, it's actually a couple of months ago.

34:21.460 --> 34:28.220
Anyway, my biggest problem was my game brain took over.

34:28.220 --> 34:34.660
And my game brain said, there's a clock up here and this clock is advancing.

34:34.660 --> 34:35.660
It's getting later.

34:35.660 --> 34:39.900
I only have so much time to get through all this stuff.

34:39.900 --> 34:46.780
So I was too tempted to fast forward clips and not really watch them and just scan for

34:46.780 --> 34:49.120
the language in the clips.

34:49.120 --> 34:54.660
And I think I robbed myself of an experience by doing that.

34:54.660 --> 34:59.400
So I want to make, I'm going to tell you one kind of spoilery thing, but I'm telling you

34:59.400 --> 35:00.400
this.

35:00.400 --> 35:04.080
I'm going to intentionally say this because trust me, this is something you're going to

35:04.080 --> 35:05.880
want to know.

35:05.880 --> 35:08.720
You can't lose the game.

35:08.720 --> 35:09.720
That's the spoiler.

35:09.720 --> 35:11.380
You can't lose.

35:11.380 --> 35:16.040
Now that you know that, you cannot make the same mistake I did and turn your game brain

35:16.040 --> 35:18.980
off and enjoy the story for what it is.

35:18.980 --> 35:22.420
And I think you'll have a better experience.

35:22.420 --> 35:28.420
So that's my one criticism with as brilliant as this game is, I wish it almost hadn't been

35:28.420 --> 35:33.820
presented like the game it was because it made me think I got to get through this faster.

35:33.820 --> 35:35.780
It's going to be game over.

35:35.780 --> 35:38.220
And that's totally not the case with this at all.

35:38.220 --> 35:41.100
So, all right.

35:41.100 --> 35:47.900
Let's see comments and chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

35:47.900 --> 35:53.940
Hi, Stella, Chad starts in chat talking about walking Sims.

35:53.940 --> 35:56.340
I don't think I've played a walking Sim that hasn't been fantastic.

35:56.340 --> 35:57.340
No, true.

35:57.340 --> 35:58.900
Like they're all really good.

35:58.900 --> 36:05.460
Fifth dream says, is this the game with Angeles seraphian and I hope I said the right in it.

36:05.460 --> 36:06.820
I admit I bought the game just for her.

36:06.820 --> 36:07.820
I'm sorry.

36:07.820 --> 36:09.120
I don't know who their names.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.900
I don't know the actors and actresses names, but they are really good.

36:11.900 --> 36:12.900
Chad is confirming.

36:12.900 --> 36:13.900
Yes.

36:13.900 --> 36:14.900
Fifth dream says yes.

36:14.900 --> 36:16.660
It's a bit crazy, but it's a cool concept.

36:16.660 --> 36:17.660
She hope says yes.

36:18.420 --> 36:19.420
And I like it so far.

36:19.420 --> 36:20.420
And Bobby black of confirming.

36:20.420 --> 36:21.420
Yes.

36:21.420 --> 36:22.420
It's on Xbox one.

36:22.420 --> 36:23.940
So anyway, that was my experience with telling lies.

36:23.940 --> 36:25.740
I really liked it.

36:25.740 --> 36:37.500
I just, I think the story is so smart in this context that they had to think of all these

36:37.500 --> 36:39.900
different ways that you could navigate it.

36:39.900 --> 36:42.340
I just it's, it's really impressive anyway.

36:42.340 --> 36:44.900
So I give a big thumbs up to telling lies.

36:45.140 --> 36:49.300
I'm curious to see what else we get that might be like this.

36:49.300 --> 36:54.900
Not that I want every game to copy this format, but I love the idea of, so, so I mentioned

36:54.900 --> 36:57.320
like, okay, it's not like a game.

36:57.320 --> 37:01.900
Like you might think most games are with like action elements and push X to not die and

37:01.900 --> 37:02.900
things like that.

37:02.900 --> 37:07.280
Like it isn't a game like that, but we've had these things lately, like the band or

37:07.280 --> 37:11.000
snatch episode of, uh, uh, black mirror.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
We've had this now.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.940
And of course her story before that.

37:13.980 --> 37:19.860
And we've had other things that are more like, it's almost like it's less of a game and more

37:19.860 --> 37:28.460
of a interactive storytelling, a new medium to tell using gamification to tell store,

37:28.460 --> 37:29.460
tell your story.

37:29.460 --> 37:31.100
I'd say that's what it really is.

37:31.100 --> 37:34.340
It's gamification to tell a story.

37:34.340 --> 37:35.900
And I think it's really neat.

37:35.900 --> 37:41.460
And I'm, I'm so curious to see what else comes of it because yeah, I loved telling lies.

37:41.460 --> 37:42.940
So there you go.

37:42.940 --> 37:47.340
Buzz Buster says technology is finally caught up with what CD-ROMs attempted to do in the

37:47.340 --> 37:48.340
nineties.

37:48.340 --> 37:49.340
Right?

37:49.340 --> 37:52.740
Honestly, there's no reason this game could not have existed in the late nineties except

37:52.740 --> 37:59.700
for, I think they say there's like, they shot hundreds of hours of footage for the game

37:59.700 --> 38:02.680
and there's, I think at least 10 hours in it.

38:02.680 --> 38:06.620
And that would be the one thing that would prevent it from existing in 1990 is storage

38:06.620 --> 38:07.700
mediums.

38:07.700 --> 38:11.520
You wouldn't let CD-ROMs could hold how much, how much video could a CD-ROM hold?

38:11.520 --> 38:13.640
Like 34 minutes, something like that.

38:13.640 --> 38:15.040
It wasn't a lot.

38:15.040 --> 38:18.000
So that's, that's the one thing.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.400
So, all right.

38:20.400 --> 38:21.600
Anyhow, that's my gaming week.

38:21.600 --> 38:22.600
Sorry.

38:22.600 --> 38:24.400
I talked a lot about that game, but that happens sometimes.

38:24.400 --> 38:25.600
All right.

38:25.600 --> 38:26.920
Let's get into some other news.

38:26.920 --> 38:29.780
Oh wait, before we do that, let me do some quick housekeeping actually.

38:29.780 --> 38:33.320
So we will not be here live next week.

38:33.320 --> 38:36.800
We will not be here live with Orange El Dorado next week because it is Labor Day.

38:36.800 --> 38:39.660
Well, it's also, it's also Labor Day weekend.

38:39.660 --> 38:42.620
We haven't done a show over Labor Day weekend for the past eight years.

38:42.620 --> 38:44.620
Normally that's because I'm not here.

38:44.620 --> 38:46.580
I'm at Dragon Con.

38:46.580 --> 38:48.980
And that's only partially true this year.

38:48.980 --> 38:52.580
Obviously with the pandemic, I'm not flying out to Atlanta to go to Dragon Con in person

38:52.580 --> 38:54.820
because they're not having Dragon Con in person this year.

38:54.820 --> 38:56.340
They're having it virtually.

38:56.340 --> 38:59.300
So I'm going to be participating with the virtual Dragon Con event.

38:59.300 --> 39:03.300
And I want to invite you guys to participate along because you can actually, you don't

39:03.300 --> 39:07.260
have to have a ticket to do a lot of the Dragon Con stuff this year.

39:07.260 --> 39:12.740
They actually are running three different feeds on, the official con is hosting feeds

39:12.740 --> 39:18.280
on Vimeo or I think there's an app available on Roku if you use that.

39:18.280 --> 39:22.900
And you can watch several different Dragon Con dedicated channels all weekend.

39:22.900 --> 39:24.840
And that's pretty cool.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.700
But also some of the different fan tracks.

39:26.700 --> 39:31.300
So what makes Dragon Con unique is that it's like, it's almost like 20 different fan conventions

39:31.300 --> 39:34.220
happening all at once.

39:34.220 --> 39:36.440
And that's what makes it really cool.

39:36.440 --> 39:40.620
So one of the tracks that I've participated with for years and years, back since it was

39:40.620 --> 39:45.080
called the podcasting track, is the digital media track because now it's not just podcasting

39:45.080 --> 39:49.680
but Twitch, YouTube, and all the other ways that people create content.

39:49.680 --> 39:52.920
They're going to be streaming their panels all weekend long on Twitch.

39:52.920 --> 39:55.040
It's going to be virtual panels.

39:55.040 --> 39:59.500
So you'll want to check out DC Digital Media on Twitch.

39:59.500 --> 40:02.940
Or we'll be hosting it here at VOG Network, of course.

40:02.940 --> 40:06.340
So you can just come to the usual place and you'll see it there too.

40:06.340 --> 40:10.860
I'm going to be participating in three different panels over the weekend.

40:10.860 --> 40:15.960
Friday at 7 Pacific, 10 Eastern, I'm going to be on a panel about networking and building

40:15.960 --> 40:19.040
a podcast network and why should you join a podcast network?

40:19.040 --> 40:21.460
Or why might you not want to join a podcast network?

40:21.460 --> 40:22.460
Because there's some cons as well.

40:22.460 --> 40:25.080
So we're going to talk a little bit about that and some things I've learned from my

40:25.080 --> 40:29.000
different experience of the three different networks I've been with over the years.

40:29.000 --> 40:33.860
So we'll talk about that at 7 Pacific, 10 Eastern on Friday.

40:33.860 --> 40:37.700
On September 5th, video didn't kill the radio star.

40:37.700 --> 40:45.820
Bobby Black Wolf, myself, I believe we got Rochelle from formerly of Electric Sisterhood,

40:45.820 --> 40:48.900
but now the show Black Compat is going to be joining us.

40:48.900 --> 40:53.520
This is great because usually we don't get her at Dragon Con, but thanks to everything

40:53.520 --> 40:55.260
being virtual, she's going to join us for this.

40:55.260 --> 40:56.800
I'm really excited about that.

40:56.800 --> 41:02.400
And I believe Bill Run, Jump, Stomp is going to be joining us for that panel as well.

41:02.400 --> 41:05.060
And I hope I'm not forgetting anyone, Bobby, I think it's just the four of us, but I might

41:05.060 --> 41:07.580
be leaving somebody out unintentionally.

41:07.580 --> 41:12.860
But we are going to be talking about taking your podcast in an audio format and taking

41:12.860 --> 41:15.860
it to video, which is something we all have experience doing.

41:15.860 --> 41:19.460
So we're going to talk a little bit about that and very excited for that panel.

41:19.460 --> 41:23.920
We did it last year and it was, we were kind of surprised at how many people showed up.

41:23.920 --> 41:25.140
So it was really cool.

41:25.140 --> 41:28.600
So we're going to do it again this year in a virtual format, so that's really exciting.

41:28.600 --> 41:32.420
So stay tuned for that on September 5th.

41:32.420 --> 41:38.760
And then September 6th at Sunday at 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern, I'm going to be

41:38.760 --> 41:42.160
doing a panel called Educating and Entertaining Online.

41:42.160 --> 41:50.280
And it's basically a panel of educators and talking about making that conversion to online

41:50.280 --> 41:52.620
in this whole pandemic.

41:52.620 --> 41:55.640
Teachers really went through it.

41:55.640 --> 42:00.160
And a lot of us though, were able to use some of our knowledge we've gotten from broadcasting

42:00.160 --> 42:01.160
to be able to kind of help that.

42:01.160 --> 42:03.480
So we're going to talk a little bit about that.

42:03.480 --> 42:05.440
It might be like, Rob, why are you on that panel?

42:05.440 --> 42:09.420
Believe it or not, my day job, I'm not a high school teacher or an elementary school teacher.

42:09.420 --> 42:10.720
Other people on the panel are.

42:10.720 --> 42:16.200
I create training in a corporate environment is the short story of what I do that actually

42:16.200 --> 42:17.380
pays my bills.

42:17.380 --> 42:21.840
So I do have experience in teaching of a different sort in a corporate environment.

42:21.840 --> 42:24.020
So I'll be lending that perspective to the panel.

42:24.020 --> 42:27.420
So that is all on Sunday, 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern.

42:27.420 --> 42:28.860
And that is all, of course, on Twitch.

42:28.860 --> 42:32.800
So we will not be here with Orange Lounge Radio while Virtual Dragon Con is going on.

42:32.800 --> 42:33.800
And it's just a long weekend.

42:33.800 --> 42:39.440
And we imagine many of you are going to be doing things, although of course, don't forget,

42:39.440 --> 42:40.560
there's a pandemic going on.

42:40.560 --> 42:44.800
So if you are out doing things, wear the mask, social distance, y'all know the drill.

42:44.800 --> 42:49.940
But I imagine there's still a lot of people that are going to go to a beach or go camping

42:49.940 --> 42:53.780
or do some of the outdoorsy things that have become very popular this year in light of

42:53.780 --> 42:54.780
the pandemic.

42:54.780 --> 42:56.980
So have fun, but be safe, of course.

42:56.980 --> 42:59.200
So all right.

42:59.200 --> 43:00.700
That's it for my gaming week.

43:00.700 --> 43:05.200
So let's move on and get into some gaming news for tonight.

43:05.200 --> 43:07.940
So Loki, why don't you start us off?

43:07.940 --> 43:08.940
All right.

43:08.940 --> 43:15.180
So let's talk about more, more wrap ups of different digital events.

43:15.180 --> 43:21.740
So Nintendo did another one of their directs with our direct mini, I should say, that was

43:21.740 --> 43:24.920
covering our partners or their partner showcase.

43:24.920 --> 43:26.880
So it's all the third party games.

43:26.880 --> 43:30.900
So some of the stuff they showed off their Kingdom Hearts, Melody of Memory, which is

43:30.900 --> 43:38.380
coming November 13th, they're going to have an eight player free for all local co-op mode,

43:38.380 --> 43:40.320
which is kind of cool.

43:40.320 --> 43:45.420
They showed off some new tracks and artists for Fuser, which is pretty exciting.

43:45.420 --> 43:47.420
I can't wait to play that.

43:47.420 --> 43:54.360
Taeko no Tatujin, Rhythmic Adventure 1 and Rhythmic Adventure 2 coming this winter as

43:54.360 --> 43:56.280
a combo pack.

43:56.280 --> 44:01.860
Apparently World of Tanks Blitz is coming to the Switch as well, or is on the Switch

44:01.860 --> 44:04.040
now.

44:04.040 --> 44:08.620
They have a collection of the saga, Final Fantasy Legend.

44:08.620 --> 44:13.540
It's going to be bringing Game Boy classic versions of those.

44:13.540 --> 44:17.260
I guess it's December, Just Dance 2021.

44:17.260 --> 44:21.500
And this is the first version that is not going to be on the Wii.

44:21.500 --> 44:26.920
So that was a long run, but that trend is over, unfortunately.

44:26.920 --> 44:29.680
So now it's on the Switch.

44:29.680 --> 44:35.660
That's coming out November 12th, Puyo Tetris II is going to be expanding with some new

44:35.660 --> 44:38.380
modes in December 8th.

44:38.380 --> 44:42.860
That's kind of a surprise.

44:42.860 --> 44:48.260
I'm kind of surprised Puyo Tetris is, I'll go back through some of these when you finish

44:48.260 --> 44:49.260
the recap.

44:49.260 --> 44:50.260
Sorry.

44:50.260 --> 44:55.300
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Editions coming, or already came out, I guess.

44:55.300 --> 44:57.300
So that was earlier this week.

44:57.300 --> 45:02.660
And then they talked a little bit about the Minecraft Dungeons Winter DLC, which is coming

45:02.660 --> 45:03.660
next month.

45:03.660 --> 45:11.700
Yeah, and it's more expansions for other games like Captain Tsubasa and Jump Force Luxe Edition.

45:11.700 --> 45:13.700
Gotcha.

45:13.700 --> 45:17.660
So focusing on a couple of those announcements, well, there was a lot of music game announcements.

45:17.660 --> 45:19.660
Did you notice that?

45:19.660 --> 45:23.860
Obviously as a longtime music game fan, I was like, wow, there's like all these music

45:23.860 --> 45:25.380
games showing up.

45:25.380 --> 45:31.220
The Kingdom Hearts, Melody of Memory, which essentially is Kingdom Hearts' theater rhythm.

45:31.260 --> 45:34.220
I'm not sure how I feel about that game.

45:34.220 --> 45:39.580
I want to get it because I love theater rhythm, but I'm worried it's going to be like, did

45:39.580 --> 45:40.580
they tell us the price?

45:40.580 --> 45:42.580
They didn't tell us the price, did they?

45:42.580 --> 45:47.180
I'm worried it's going to be too much money and the music isn't going to be worth it.

45:47.180 --> 45:50.700
I'm not sure the Kingdom Hearts franchise has music.

45:50.700 --> 45:55.980
Yes, there are some songs, I know everybody's going to say, but what about Utada and that

45:55.980 --> 45:56.980
stuff?

45:56.980 --> 46:00.380
Yeah, there's some great songs, but I just don't know if there's a whole game's worth.

46:00.420 --> 46:07.220
There were all the songs from the Under the Sea level from the Little Mermaid stuff.

46:07.220 --> 46:09.620
We had to sing all the songs with it.

46:09.620 --> 46:14.020
There were all, I mean, the soundtracks for them actually were really amazing.

46:14.020 --> 46:18.020
I would anticipate that just about any of those levels that had special music for them

46:18.020 --> 46:21.620
would have been incorporated quite a bit.

46:21.620 --> 46:26.620
And Let It Go was in the trailer, so I'm sure there's a strong Disney present.

46:26.860 --> 46:30.860
Yes, I wince too, but that indicates there is a strong Disney presence.

46:30.860 --> 46:33.860
That's not necessarily what I'm referring to as well.

46:33.860 --> 46:38.860
I mean, the music in the game itself is fairly memorable.

46:38.860 --> 46:42.860
If Amazon is to be believed, it's $60.

46:42.860 --> 46:44.860
See, that might be a bit high for me.

46:44.860 --> 46:45.860
I might wait for a sale.

46:45.860 --> 46:46.860
We'll see.

46:46.860 --> 46:50.860
I'll wait and see what the reaction is when the game comes out.

46:50.860 --> 46:53.860
But I am a little more excited about Fusor.

46:54.100 --> 46:57.100
I did like Drop Mix, so that was cool to see.

46:57.100 --> 47:00.100
And I thought the Taiko game looked really cute too.

47:00.100 --> 47:03.100
And I think that game already exists in Japan, if I'm not mistaken.

47:03.100 --> 47:08.100
So it's kind of cool that we're getting it packaged as a combo here, getting to check that out.

47:08.100 --> 47:09.100
So that's cool.

47:09.100 --> 47:13.100
And then of course Just Dance, you know, it's kind of a standard at this point.

47:13.100 --> 47:18.100
But that was four music game updates in a Nintendo Direct, so that was pretty cool.

47:18.100 --> 47:22.100
Then I was talking about Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 coming out of nowhere.

47:22.340 --> 47:29.340
That really surprised me because I kind of thought that conversation with Tetris had shifted to Tetris Effect, obviously.

47:29.340 --> 47:32.340
And then on the Nintendo side, Tetris 99.

47:32.340 --> 47:37.340
And I kind of thought Puyo Puyo Tetris would be a one-off.

47:37.340 --> 47:39.340
And that's not me saying anything negative.

47:39.340 --> 47:40.340
I enjoyed it.

47:40.340 --> 47:41.340
I thought it was fun.

47:41.340 --> 47:44.340
I'm just surprised that they felt the need to do a sequel.

47:44.340 --> 47:48.340
But maybe the first one sold much better than expected.

47:48.340 --> 47:50.340
How many different systems was it on?

47:50.340 --> 47:51.340
It was on quite a few.

47:51.580 --> 47:52.580
It was.

47:52.580 --> 47:53.580
It wasn't quite a few.

47:53.580 --> 47:58.580
Now, of course, I kind of giggle when they talk about, oh, the story.

47:58.580 --> 47:59.580
There's an all-new story.

47:59.580 --> 48:00.580
I'm like, what story?

48:00.580 --> 48:02.580
They don't play those games for the story.

48:02.580 --> 48:03.580
But okay.

48:03.580 --> 48:05.580
But I think it's cool.

48:05.580 --> 48:07.580
And Dark Soccer, you're a fan of that game, too.

48:07.580 --> 48:11.580
So is the news of a sequel kind of surprised you, or are you pumped for that?

48:13.580 --> 48:16.580
I'm vaguely indifferent about it right now.

48:16.820 --> 48:20.820
Just because I'm actually kind of going back to playing a few different puzzle games as

48:20.820 --> 48:24.820
much as I love Puyo Puyo, I did not really enjoy it combined with Tetris.

48:24.820 --> 48:25.820
Fair enough.

48:25.820 --> 48:29.820
If I'm going to play Puyo Puyo, it's going to be Puyo Puyo.

48:29.820 --> 48:33.820
Bobby Blackwolf is confirming that this new game will be multi-platform as well.

48:33.820 --> 48:34.820
So cool.

48:34.820 --> 48:35.820
All right.

48:35.820 --> 48:39.820
Well, let's move on and talk a little bit about some changes to Pokemon Go.

48:39.820 --> 48:44.820
Pokemon Go, of course, is a game that I spent a little bit of my spare time playing.

48:44.820 --> 48:45.820
And I know a lot of you do as well.

48:46.060 --> 48:50.060
And Pokemon Go finally brought Mega Evolutions to the game this week.

48:50.060 --> 48:54.060
I say finally, but I mean, when the game first launched, I would have never expected that

48:54.060 --> 48:55.060
these would make their way into the game.

48:55.060 --> 48:57.060
But they are here now.

48:57.060 --> 49:02.060
They've launched Mega Evolutions of Venusaur, Charizard, there's two, X and Y, Blastoise,

49:02.060 --> 49:03.060
and Beedrill.

49:03.060 --> 49:06.060
There's a quest line in the game that will get you the energy to do Beedrill.

49:06.060 --> 49:11.060
And then you can Mega Evolve the others by doing a lot of raids.

49:11.060 --> 49:14.060
They introduced this currency called Mega Energy into the game.

49:14.300 --> 49:17.300
And you get Mega Energy when you do raids.

49:17.300 --> 49:22.300
But long story short, I don't think the raids are worth the bang for the buck.

49:22.300 --> 49:27.300
You have to do like at least, like you have to be good and do four of these raids.

49:27.300 --> 49:32.300
You're probably going to have to do more of like five or six Venusaur raids, just that,

49:32.300 --> 49:38.300
to get enough energy to Mega Evolve Venusaur one time for four hours.

49:38.300 --> 49:42.300
After that, the cost of it will go down to Mega Evolve it.

49:42.540 --> 49:46.540
It's still kind of like one of those, what's the reason to do it besides a short little

49:46.540 --> 49:50.540
boost in gym battles and to be a completionist in the Pokédex?

49:50.540 --> 49:56.540
And I think the prospect four years into the game to catch a Venusaur, which is an evolution

49:56.540 --> 50:01.540
of one of the first Pokémon that was in the game, like six times from a raid.

50:01.540 --> 50:03.540
I just don't see the incentive there.

50:03.540 --> 50:07.540
So Niantic needs to rework this system.

50:07.540 --> 50:13.780
Now the good news is a lot of people have expressed their concerns, to put it that way.

50:13.780 --> 50:15.780
And Niantic has responded.

50:15.780 --> 50:19.780
They responded on Reddit and they wrote a tweet that's basically like, we hear your

50:19.780 --> 50:23.780
concerns about Mega Evolutions and we're looking into what we can do.

50:23.780 --> 50:25.780
So that doesn't mean it's going to change tomorrow.

50:25.780 --> 50:29.780
But it's nice to hear that they recognize there's an issue and they need to look at

50:29.780 --> 50:30.780
it.

50:31.020 --> 50:39.020
Me personally, I would fix it by not having Mega Energy be per species.

50:39.020 --> 50:40.020
That is silly.

50:40.020 --> 50:43.020
Just have it be out of one bank, Mega Energy.

50:43.020 --> 50:46.020
And you should be able to get Mega Energy from other things as well.

50:46.020 --> 50:51.020
You should be able to get Mega Energy from doing quests, Mega Energy from hatching eggs,

50:51.020 --> 50:55.020
and doing other things besides just the raiding.

50:55.020 --> 51:00.020
I think even if it's just a little bit, I think it would make it a little more exciting.

51:00.020 --> 51:03.260
And so that's, yeah, that's my concern with the Mega Raid.

51:03.260 --> 51:08.260
ActDeftInChat says, Megas are here and most people are not liking it with good reason.

51:08.260 --> 51:11.260
Yeah, four at the minimum, but most likely it'll be at least five.

51:11.260 --> 51:14.260
My gripe with this is, what are Megas good for right now?

51:14.260 --> 51:15.260
They're almost useless.

51:15.260 --> 51:17.260
That's another good point.

51:17.260 --> 51:20.260
You transform them for four hours.

51:20.260 --> 51:25.260
I did do a Mega Raid where somebody brought, we were fighting a Venusaur, so somebody brought

51:25.260 --> 51:28.260
a boosted or Mega Charizard into the fight.

51:28.500 --> 51:34.500
And what happens is that the Charizard, just being there, boosts everybody's fire attacks.

51:34.500 --> 51:39.500
So it makes it that you need less people to get it down or you get it down faster.

51:39.500 --> 51:41.500
So that is the perk at the end of the day.

51:41.500 --> 51:46.500
And I imagine for those that really like to solo raids, it'll probably make getting some

51:46.500 --> 51:51.500
of those three stars a lot more solo-able if you use them.

51:51.740 --> 51:57.740
Shane in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says, I cannot get into the way they've done

51:57.740 --> 51:58.740
mega evolution.

51:58.740 --> 52:03.740
I've kind of stopped playing the game because it just sits so wrong with me.

52:03.740 --> 52:07.740
I don't know if I would write off the whole game because of it, because like, for example,

52:07.740 --> 52:09.740
I don't care for the battle league.

52:09.740 --> 52:11.740
I want nothing to do with it.

52:11.740 --> 52:16.740
I don't like that there's rewards tied to it, but I just don't play it.

52:16.740 --> 52:20.740
The one nice thing about Go is that there's a lot of other things you can do.

52:20.740 --> 52:22.740
You can still go out and catch Pokemon.

52:22.740 --> 52:23.740
You can look for shinies.

52:23.740 --> 52:24.740
You can hatch eggs.

52:24.740 --> 52:26.740
You can try to take gyms.

52:26.740 --> 52:27.740
You can explore new gyms.

52:27.740 --> 52:32.740
I still feel like there's a lot of other stuff to do in the game, but I think the weekly events

52:32.740 --> 52:36.740
that they were doing, like the Enigma week and the Unova week and some of that stuff,

52:36.740 --> 52:39.740
that stuff was way more exciting than mega evolutions have been.

52:39.740 --> 52:45.740
So hopefully Niantic takes a chance to re-examine this whole thing because I'm not super into it.

52:45.740 --> 52:48.740
But at least there's other stuff that makes it interesting.

52:48.740 --> 52:50.740
There is that.

52:50.740 --> 52:51.740
All right.

52:51.740 --> 52:52.740
Well, let's move on.

52:52.740 --> 52:56.740
We're going to go to our next story from DarkSakura, and you guys will have to excuse me.

52:56.740 --> 52:59.740
I'm going to step away for just a moment.

52:59.740 --> 53:01.740
So other stuff then.

53:01.740 --> 53:09.740
Well, this one, I'll admit, I've got some cautious hopefulness about this one.

53:09.740 --> 53:13.740
And honestly, I wouldn't have really given this a lot of attention if it wasn't for Shane,

53:13.740 --> 53:16.740
who is in our chat right now.

53:16.740 --> 53:22.740
And that's about another Kickstarter for and I'm going to mispronounce this IUDIN Chronicles.

53:22.740 --> 53:26.740
And actually, after watching the trailer, it actually sounds.

53:26.740 --> 53:27.740
Yeah, you didn't.

53:27.740 --> 53:28.740
Thank you.

53:28.740 --> 53:32.740
It actually sounds like it's going to be a pretty neat game here.

53:32.740 --> 53:38.740
I mean, to the point that I'm actually considering putting some money down on it myself.

53:38.740 --> 53:41.740
It's a JRPG.

53:41.740 --> 53:49.740
It's it actually hit its initial funding of fifty thousand dollars by for Rabbit and Bear Studios.

53:49.740 --> 53:52.740
They've added a bunch of stretch goals on it.

53:52.740 --> 53:59.740
And it's going to have basically a lot of characters, very like Suikoden.

53:59.740 --> 54:07.740
And it looks like the they've got involved in this is Murayama Yoshitaka.

54:07.740 --> 54:13.740
There are 2D characters combined with 3D environments, very similar to Octopath Traveler,

54:13.740 --> 54:23.740
but it is now number three in the biggest video game kickstarters in history.

54:23.740 --> 54:29.740
So the only two that have topped it by number two is Shenmue three.

54:29.740 --> 54:32.740
Number three was Bloodstained Ritual of the Night.

54:32.740 --> 54:41.740
And I have to say, I'm looking at it with with some hope, so I'm considering putting some down on it as well.

54:41.740 --> 54:46.740
Maybe I'm not going to go for all the crazy stretch goals, but who knows?

54:46.740 --> 54:48.740
I think that. Oh, wait, wait, wait.

54:48.740 --> 54:56.740
I just had an FYI in the chat by by Shane here saying, yeah, the closing stream was great and the guests were awesome.

54:56.740 --> 55:01.740
Plus Akira Yamaoka was there and you could never go wrong with him.

55:01.740 --> 55:08.740
Agreed, agreed. And who knows? I mean, maybe we'll we'll have some of his music in there, which definitely mean I would have to have this.

55:08.740 --> 55:15.740
So, yeah, I mean, four point five million over that amount in crowdfunding.

55:15.740 --> 55:20.740
That's pretty, pretty amazing. A lot of people are excited about it.

55:20.740 --> 55:26.740
So we'll see how it how it comes. I'm actually fairly, fairly hopeful.

55:26.740 --> 55:29.740
Yeah, it looks pretty good. I guess it ended yesterday.

55:29.740 --> 55:37.740
So did it. Well, but it looks it looks pretty cool, like definitely getting the.

55:37.740 --> 55:45.740
Yeah, I mean, the art style is pretty awesome, so I do see the comparison between this and Octopath Traveler,

55:45.740 --> 55:50.740
especially just like the traversal of like the town stuff looks very much like Octopath,

55:50.740 --> 55:55.740
although the battle system is completely different and a lot more cinematic.

55:55.740 --> 56:02.740
I do like I do like the character designs. I mean, there's definitely some cosplay able people in there.

56:02.740 --> 56:11.740
So, yeah, I'm very interested to see what this looks like once it comes out, but I'm not going to be for a while.

56:11.740 --> 56:15.740
It's not supposed to go out until October twenty twenty two.

56:15.740 --> 56:22.740
So it is what it is. I will probably have forgotten about this game by the time it actually makes its way out.

56:22.740 --> 56:26.740
Don't worry. Shane will remind you. I'm sure he will.

56:26.740 --> 56:32.740
I'm back and I will be reminding you because I actually backed the project.

56:32.740 --> 56:38.740
So I just I did it at a very small level where I'm just getting the digital game, but I'm into it enough to want to play it.

56:38.740 --> 56:44.740
So there's a little bit more to they because of the funding,

56:44.740 --> 56:52.740
they will have localization for Korean, Brazilian, Portuguese and Russian languages.

56:52.740 --> 56:59.740
So nice. Hey, more people that get to play it then. Did you guys read any of the chat comments I was out?

56:59.740 --> 57:02.740
Well, yeah, most of them were Shane. OK, yeah.

57:02.740 --> 57:05.740
That's why I just want to make sure because, you know, he has something to say about it.

57:05.740 --> 57:12.740
So I just want to make sure they are read. But yeah, he follows it so closely that I know there's a lot of good updates to pretty much.

57:12.740 --> 57:17.740
It was because of him that I had this update. Yeah, I don't even read the emails that the campaign sends.

57:17.740 --> 57:22.740
I'm just like, oh, Shane will tell me about it when we play 14 tonight.

57:22.740 --> 57:26.740
So, yeah, he mentions in chat, though, he just posted this.

57:26.740 --> 57:30.740
So I know you didn't get to this one yet. The vampire vote didn't go his way.

57:30.740 --> 57:35.740
I wanted the David Bowie one and he lost by just a handful of votes. I kind of wanted the David Bowie one, too.

57:35.740 --> 57:40.740
So and I didn't vote. So I'm part of the problem. When you don't vote, you don't get what you want.

57:40.740 --> 57:45.740
Remember that? Yeah. So this is why we get vampires that don't look like David Bowie.

57:45.740 --> 57:50.740
Well, this is why we get a lot of problems. But anyway, yes, this this this being a non serious one.

57:50.740 --> 57:55.740
Yes. Shane is also pointing out there's a also a side game coming out for it.

57:55.740 --> 57:59.740
It's a farming style game that will come out before the main game comes out.

57:59.740 --> 58:03.740
That's kind of funny, too. I just thought it was something they were building into the main game.

58:03.740 --> 58:09.740
But it's kind of like how bloodstained Curse of the Moon had that whole like eight bit game that preceded it.

58:09.740 --> 58:16.740
They ended up getting the sequel. And then now we've got like a farming game instead of like an eight bit RPG or something.

58:16.740 --> 58:23.740
I thought that's kind of cool. It's pretty neat. Yeah. Anyway, I'm looking forward to playing the finished game in what, like three years?

58:23.740 --> 58:30.740
No, I think they're saying twenty twenty two. So it'll be a little while. All right. Meanwhile, Loki, what do you got for us?

58:30.740 --> 58:36.740
All right. So let's see. Let's talk a little bit about Halo.

58:36.740 --> 58:42.740
And so. As you may remember, the last time they showed off Halo Infinite,

58:42.740 --> 58:58.740
there was some people that didn't necessarily like the way it looked and thought that it might be not really fulfilling the promises that Microsoft had made about like a next gen Halo game.

58:58.740 --> 59:03.740
And so because of that, of course, Halo Infinite's been pushed back to twenty twenty one.

59:03.740 --> 59:15.740
And to help hopefully get Halo back on track, they've added some Halo veterans to the development of the game to be able to get that where it needs to be.

59:15.740 --> 59:27.740
So apparently one of the main writers of the early Halo games at Bungie was working on a different project that now has been brought to be a leader of the game as well.

59:27.740 --> 59:34.740
And that's Joseph Stanton. So hopefully with good writing, you know, that will help.

59:34.740 --> 59:44.740
But more of the visuals, I think, that we noticed. I mean, I don't know what the quality of the writing was in Halo Infinite, but I know the visuals are a little bit rough.

59:44.740 --> 59:50.740
We would know like we've only seen like a little bit of it. So that's another concern about the game.

59:50.740 --> 59:57.740
I again, I kind of think the conversation on visuals was overblown. I understand some of the concerns people have and so forth.

59:57.740 --> 01:00:04.740
I still thought it looked fine, but I get that there was pop in and, you know, the other things that other people have already pointed out.

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:09.740
Not necessarily that it was just like it wasn't very detailed, but like I get it. Art styles are one thing and stuff.

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:13.740
But as long as the game plays well, I guess it doesn't really matter.

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:22.740
But right. I mean, I don't know, like sometimes especially like if they're planning to do like a battle royale type mode with this,

01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:29.740
they may have simplified the graphics a bit because you're going to have, you know, maybe 100 or so players on the field at one time.

01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:36.740
And so maybe that was the reasoning behind it. But sometimes you would think with campaign you would maybe up that a little bit.

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:39.740
I don't know. That could be a possibility.

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:47.740
They're only pushing it back to early 2021, right? They didn't push it all the way back to holiday 2021, right?

01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:52.740
So my mind is kind of like, what all can they really fix with only that much time?

01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:58.740
Yes, maybe some graphical fidelity and things like that. Trying to get a little more oomph out of it. Fine. Turning up the graphics on level three.

01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:10.740
Yeah. But the writing, if that that means the voiceovers, that means the animations that go with that. That's that's a concern.

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:22.740
Well, here's the thing, too, like here. So like I know like Bungie or it's not even Bungie anymore, but like, you know, the folks behind the Halo series have made some pretty great games.

01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:33.740
But that being said, the folks behind Mass Effect made some pretty great games. And then Anthem comes out and it was kind of like, not great.

01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:40.740
And Andromeda had some serious issues, too. Yes. Yeah. So like all great companies can fall.

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:51.740
And so I kind of am a little worried. And that's why we just this day and age, even like, you know, Square Enix and Eidos or whatever, putting out different games like, you know, the upcoming Avengers game.

01:01:51.740 --> 01:02:00.740
Originally on paper, it sounds great. But then you see like the end product and it's like it just gets marred by like executive decisions and stuff.

01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:09.740
And so we just have to wait and see. We had to play it cautiously, especially if we're dropping, you know, allegedly almost a thousand dollars on these systems.

01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:14.740
We just have to play it cautiously of these games coming out. So I'm going to wait and see.

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:22.740
Well, it's funny you should bring all that up. So on a similar note, moving to our next story, you brought up Square Enix in that.

01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:30.740
And of course, Square Enix just released this week a pretty highly anticipated remaster of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:40.740
Well, it's not being very well received by critics. And if social media is any indication, fans are feeling some sort of way about it as well.

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:46.740
And a lot of the problems just have to do with it sounds like some of the choices they made for online play.

01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:56.740
This game really kind of shits the bed when it comes to online play. Basically, that that you're unlocking things in other people's dungeon.

01:02:56.740 --> 01:03:08.740
So whoever's dungeon you're doing, you're unlocking stuff in their dungeon. But yet, as I understand it, certain story flags may still get set off in your own story.

01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:18.740
So if you do a certain dungeon with a friend, you might set off something in your own story that basically ruins a major plot point in the game for you before you've even begun to really play the game.

01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:25.740
So it sounds like just the whole online situation is not good. And you have to use friend codes and all this stuff.

01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:37.740
Which is interesting because I was like, why are they still hooked on friend codes? And then I remembered, didn't they first try to reboot Crystal Chronicles on the Wii and it never happened?

01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:42.740
And now all this time later, we're getting it finally on the Switch.

01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:47.740
I thought they did like a Wii and DS version of Crystal Chronicles or was that the original Crystal Chronicles?

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:50.740
The original was Game Boy Advance and GameCube.

01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:57.740
So no, they did. They did a maybe I'm thinking of Chocobo Mystery Dungeon or something like that.

01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:02.740
They were supposed to do Crystal Chronicles on Wii and they never did.

01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:07.740
And so this thing has kind of been worked on ever since then. It sounds like it's not.

01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:13.740
It just sounds like for the amount of time we've been waiting for this, it didn't deliver.

01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:17.740
And that's very disappointing, to put it lightly. Now, again, I'm going off hearsay.

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:28.740
So if you've been playing the game and you've been loving it and you want to say something nice about it, by all means, please speak up in our chat room or send us an email over at participate at orange lounge radio dot com.

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:34.740
It's just all the reaction I've been seeing is that it's it's not doing very well.

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:38.740
Or well, I don't know. I don't know about sales, but I mean, it's just not being received very well.

01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:42.740
The critic scores certainly are indicating that. That's for sure.

01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:49.740
Now, it should be said, though, on the plus side, it does have a pretty robust light edition demo.

01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:53.740
And that's pretty cool and something we didn't have really before. So there is that.

01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:57.740
So you want to you want to say yay to some things that worked right.

01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:03.740
So Shane in chat says, if you're going to give it a shot, do not play it on mobile.

01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:09.740
I tried that last night. Yeah, I remember hearing the controls were really difficult on mobile,

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:17.740
which is almost always the case when a game that was built with a game pad in mind transitions to mobile.

01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:25.740
That transition is very often not great. Games that are designed for mobile do very well on mobile,

01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:30.740
but games that are not that are kind of shoehorned into mobile don't always go so smoothly.

01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:34.740
So anyway, maybe this one of those things I'll pick up when there's a sale.

01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:39.740
But I was I was I was really bummed out to hear, like, a lot of the crap this game's getting.

01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:48.740
It's that's a bummer. Anyway, Act Deft in chat says, confirms there wasn't a Crystal Chronicles for Wii nor later.

01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:52.740
Chocobo Mystery Dungeon was what you might have been thinking about on the Wii.

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:58.740
I swear I could probably find it, too, because I have crap that goes all the way back to E3 2006.

01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:03.740
I almost feel like it was in one of the early teasers for the Wii in 2006 was Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:09.740
And they just they didn't get around to it. So, you know, they did have a game, though.

01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:15.740
It was Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, the Crystal Bears. Mm hmm.

01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:20.740
I think you're right with that spin off game. Yeah.

01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:24.740
And Shane says there was one about a king on the Wii. Right. Yeah.

01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:29.740
I think it was that whole thing. So. All right. Anyway, let's move on.

01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:32.740
We have more stories to get to in our classic game of the week is just ahead.

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:40.740
But first, Dark Sakura. Well, there has been, of course, a very.

01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:50.740
So what I'm thinking of charged air in regards to anything having to do with civil unrest.

01:06:50.740 --> 01:07:00.740
And Ubisoft has actually promised to pull an image that was used in one of their Tom Clancy games that was accused of promoting.

01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:06.740
All right. Black Lives Matter conspiracy theories. They used the raised fist image.

01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:16.740
You know, the. Image in, I guess, people on the podcast and see it, but the raised fist image in their intro video for elite squad,

01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:23.740
which is sort of an all star action RPG on their mobile devices, kind of Fortnite style.

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:29.740
It was developed by Alliant, which is a Paris based studio. They normally do horse breeding games.

01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:35.740
But the intro shows a civil unrest with a group called Umbra, quote,

01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:41.740
a faceless organization that wants to build a new world order that is a terrorist organization.

01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:47.740
And they were using that symbol as.

01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:54.740
As I guess their their symbol, which, of course, is completely tone deaf.

01:07:54.740 --> 01:08:03.740
Number one and really is sending the wrong message for the use of that symbol for for gamers everywhere.

01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:08.740
It really is insensitive and it's very good that they took it down.

01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:17.740
And for the for those who are in chat, I will gladly post the image so that people can see what the one in question is.

01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:21.740
But yeah, it's it's it's ridiculously insensitive.

01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:26.740
And they need they need to if they haven't pulled it down already, it needs to be down now.

01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:36.740
So there was actually a comment and actually I think some of this is already linked on our discord over at Vogue Network dot com slash discord.

01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:39.740
You can join our discord server and chat with us throughout the week.

01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:46.740
And Dungeon Buster in Discord actually linked to a tweet that was written by Brendan Gibbons.

01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:50.740
And Brendan Gibbons is a game and narrative designer for hire.

01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:57.740
So I believe Brendan worked on this title and wrote this tweet that said, angry about the use of the black power fist here.

01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:07.740
I worked on the character bios and was informed that Umbra is supposed to be a James Bond villain organization, not something that looks like.

01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:14.740
Yeah, not something that looks like what the Q conspiracy people think is happening. Irresponsibly bad optics.

01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:19.740
That tweet is very thank you for sharing that on our discord, Dungeon Buster, because that tweet is very interesting.

01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:26.740
When you hear one of the assumed writers again, I'm sorry, I don't have all the details on what this gentleman did for the game, what they contributed.

01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:35.740
But to hear that, like they thought they were doing one thing and what translated into the visuals wasn't a match.

01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:41.740
Like that's that's really crazy to hear, because when I looked at the video and I'm trying to look at the video,

01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:43.740
like that's kind of the first time I saw it was that tweet and everything.

01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:48.740
And I'm looking at the video and I'm going, this doesn't look like a James Bond organization at all.

01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:52.740
And when I looked at the video, I'm like, yeah, it this is bad optics.

01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:58.740
This does look a little too close to stuff that's going on in the real world.

01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:04.740
So it's yeah, it was yikes anyway.

01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:14.740
Let's see, Act F says a co-host and I were talking about this on GFM cast and he explained to me that the rioters shown in the game are controlled by a terrorist group.

01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:16.740
But yeah, it doesn't excuse them from doing that.

01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:22.740
You know, still, this is a trailer that promotes your game and think about what you know, what what are you really promoting in that?

01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:30.740
So, yikes. Anyway, I'm glad they're at least going to fix it, for what it's worth.

01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:33.740
All right, moving on, Loki.

01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:38.740
Yes. So let's talk a little bit about mods and console mods.

01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:42.740
So there are some pretty cool portable Wii mods this week.

01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:53.740
So one of those being from Jinger of Mods, who basically fit a Wii system into the size of like almost like our original Game Boy Color.

01:10:54.740 --> 01:11:06.740
And so, yeah, it's pretty cool using basically they have to hack up the original Wii motherboard and cut off a bunch of the circuits from that.

01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:19.740
And then it's also using a 240P display and parts from the DS and also from a Switch controller and even a GameCube controller.

01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:24.740
So very convoluted, but it is pretty cool the results from that.

01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:30.740
However, though, if you're looking for to do this yourself and you want to spend the money to do that, you have a spare Wii and all the other stuff.

01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:39.740
You can actually go to there's a website store that bitbuilt.net and they have something called the G-Boy.

01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:48.740
G-Boy and it's a DIY portable kit, so it'll save you the time of having developed your own shell and everything for that.

01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:54.740
So it comes with the case, the display and some of the other charging circuitry as well.

01:11:54.740 --> 01:12:02.740
You'll just need to supply the battery, micro SD card, D-pads and ABXY buttons, which are found on a DS.

01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:06.740
And of course, you know, the Wii console itself.

01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:08.740
But then they have the instructions on how to build it.

01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:12.740
And I actually watched one of the YouTubers, I watched my tech tips.

01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:16.740
They actually built one and it looks definitely advanced.

01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:23.740
There's lots of soldering, obviously, and you have to also be very careful with cutting that circuit board, the main motherboard of the Wii.

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:30.740
But the results look pretty cool. Like if I had the time and skills, I would love to build one.

01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:38.740
Yeah, it looks pretty neat from what I was seeing, too, is that, yeah, it's a pretty slick looking thing, but definitely not something I would want to attempt on my own.

01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:43.740
Yeah, so but yeah, if you're interested, like I said, check out that Bitbuilt website.

01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:50.740
They've got a lot of stuff that you can, I think we even have other portable kits as well. So check it out.

01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:59.740
All right. Well, let's move on to talk about this old rumor is back, upgrades for the Nintendo Switch in 2021.

01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:07.740
So we've had this rumor circulating a couple of times now that Nintendo plans to do like a Switch Pro or some type of upgraded Switch model.

01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:10.740
So, you know, why are we talking about it again?

01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:22.740
Well, this time the rumor is coming from Bloomberg, which is more of an investor type of publication and not somebody's like game blog or social media or what have you.

01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:29.740
So that's why this one is gaining a little more traction around the Internet than the others, because it's coming from more the investor side of things.

01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:40.740
So Bloomberg did say in a recent report that the successor basically to the Nintendo Switch, the next Switch, we obviously don't have a name for it, is due in 2021.

01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:47.740
It is called a upgraded model of its Switch console. So it's not supposed to be something where like it'll be a whole new system.

01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:58.740
It's just some type of like Switch upgrade. Also saying that Nintendo has looked into including more computing power and 4K high definition graphics.

01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:11.740
That takes a lot of people by surprise to hear 4K graphics because Nintendo, Nintendo kind of tends to show up later to the graphics and all that stuff party.

01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:17.740
So to hear that Nintendo's thinking about 4K already seems to be a little bit surprising.

01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:24.740
Of course, we have no idea if this means, does that mean 4K portable or just 4K when it's docked?

01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:28.740
I would imagine docked.

01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:37.740
Yeah, I would imagine docked only as well, but we don't know. Like that's just, you know, our logical brains trying to tell us what we think is going to happen.

01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:41.740
But we don't know until Nintendo actually announces.

01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:48.740
There was a similar story as well in a Taiwan economic magazine, Taiwan Economic Daily News.

01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:51.740
So yeah, that's that's where they're at.

01:14:51.740 --> 01:15:00.740
It was pointed out that the time between the 3DS and the 3DS or the new 3DS was a similar timeframe.

01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:04.740
So this getting an upgrade would not be completely surprising.

01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:07.740
And I think some of us are kind of expecting it anyway.

01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:11.740
I just hope it doesn't kind of like splinter the Switch's base too much.

01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:17.740
I think the biggest problem with the new 3DS is that I was never really convinced I needed one.

01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:22.740
Yeah, there wasn't really a good reason for it. There's a handful of games that needed it.

01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:24.740
Two or three games that needed it.

01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:31.740
And the Super Nintendo, which I remember I threw a fit about because I'm like, why can't the frickin...

01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:35.740
But anyway, that's old frickin' news at this point.

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:41.740
But I'm very curious, like what is really going to justify this new Switch?

01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:44.740
And I hope it doesn't splinter things up too much.

01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:49.740
But if it's one of those things where it's like, OK, docked, it will do 4K on Mario.

01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:56.740
But if you have an old Switch, then it just kind of plays in 1080 instead or whatever, 720 even.

01:15:56.740 --> 01:16:00.740
Like an old Switch, then I don't think that might be too big a deal, but we'll see.

01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:04.740
I mean, I have no idea what Nintendo has in store because, again, this is all a rumor.

01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:06.740
It's a little bit of a surprise there.

01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:12.740
Sjo and Hunter Matt says Bloomberg cited sources from within Nintendo that gave this info.

01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:18.740
I would imagine if Bloomberg is citing sources, they must be more reliable than your standard Reddit user post.

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:19.740
Very good.

01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:22.740
ActDef says, I need a performance mode for the Switch.

01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:25.740
I want my Overwatch at 60 frames a second.

01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:29.740
That's a good call. That's something that perhaps a pro Switch could do.

01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:33.740
And of course, Overwatch 2 is something that's on the horizon eventually, right?

01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:35.740
Maybe in a similar timeframe. Who knows?

01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:45.740
Shane points out in chat or Chad Starzik says, the best things about the new 3DS were the nub stick and the head tracking for 3D.

01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:47.740
Yes, those were very impressive features.

01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:53.740
And when I finally did get around to buying one, when they put out that Metroid one that I really wanted, I liked those features too.

01:16:53.740 --> 01:17:00.740
But I'm not even sure it was worth it if you already owned a 3DS to get just that.

01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:03.740
But they were, I mean, it was a nice upgrade. I'm not going to lie either.

01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:06.740
Tigerclaw in chat says, here's the thing.

01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:12.740
If you get this new Switch, you're going to have to re-buy all the games you purchased digitally.

01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:14.740
Really good call out from Tigerclaw.

01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:21.740
If there is not an easy way to transfer digital licenses, I might be very hesitant to buy one.

01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:23.740
Don't they have that already?

01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:35.740
I thought they had that already. I thought they brought that into play when they had, they just put out the Switch Lite or whatever, the Switch.

01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:39.740
Yes, you're right. The Switch Lite. Jamie?

01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:40.740
Switch Lite.

01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:43.740
Well, aren't your purchases also tied to your Nintendo account?

01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:53.740
They are. And I was going to point out that we need to remember with the 3DS, since we brought that up, the 3DS, the new 3DS.

01:17:53.740 --> 01:18:01.740
I remember transferring my ambassador license. You remember that? For the really early 3DS adopters?

01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:10.740
I transferred that twice because I moved it from my original 3DS to my Zelda 3DS. I moved it from my Zelda 3DS to my Microsoft one.

01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:12.740
So you were able to move digital things.

01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:13.740
I had a Microsoft one.

01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:16.740
I'm sorry, Metroid one. What is wrong with my brain today?

01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:24.740
So, I actually know I had a migraine most of the day, but anyway. So, moving it to the Metroid one.

01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:30.740
So, you were able to move those digital licenses. You could do it between Wii and Wii U as well.

01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:36.740
Yeah, but your licenses should follow your, my Nintendo account.

01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:38.740
No, they absolutely should.

01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:41.740
And I think that's what they do for the Switch.

01:18:41.740 --> 01:18:51.740
Yeah. And DJ Roma S says, ambassadors account. Yeah, that's because, do you remember when the 3DS first came out?

01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:57.740
I don't remember what the problem was. If it wasn't selling well, I don't think they had a lot of great software.

01:18:57.740 --> 01:19:03.740
But anyway, they ended up doing this thing where they were like, if you buy a 3DS, you're going to be an ambassador.

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:11.740
And you get like, it was like 10 Game Boy Advance games for Virtual Console and like 10 Game Boys.

01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:17.740
So, you got all these like classic from the Nintendo library games that only the ambassadors ever got.

01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:20.740
Like, there was a WarioWare in there, I think.

01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:30.740
Well, here's what's confusing me about what you're saying is that you're having a new system shouldn't matter about your, the games that you own.

01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:39.740
The system, the licenses shouldn't be tied to the system, they're tied to your ID so you can have another ID with the game, another system with your ID on it.

01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:48.740
You're right, it shouldn't. But I do know when I did those other processes, it wasn't as simple as connecting to the store and redownloading everything with my login.

01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:53.740
It didn't work that way. You actually had to copy everything from the old system.

01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:57.740
And it would move everything off of the old system completely and on the new system.

01:19:57.740 --> 01:20:07.740
And I think it's one of those things about Nintendo that really ticks people off about the way they do some of the online stuff is that like the license is kind of like your ID, and your console.

01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:17.740
So, I got very silly. Yeah, so I agree and I think it's one of the things that Nintendo ought to address if they are going to convince people to upgrade to a Switch Pro.

01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:20.740
So, yeah.

01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:27.740
I mean, at least they have certain things like cloud saving for Animal Crossing and whatnot that you can at least keep your games going over.

01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:31.740
Now, they do, but that wasn't even there when it was first.

01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:35.740
So they already said that was going to be available, they just had to incorporate it into the game.

01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:38.740
Yeah. No, true, true.

01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:50.740
All right. Well, let's travel back to a more classic time. Let's go back to an era before there was cloud saves and before we had all these different pro consoles and so forth.

01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:53.740
It's the classic game of the week.

01:20:53.740 --> 01:21:01.740
And every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault to find a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be checking this game out.

01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:09.740
And wow, Jamie, yet again, we have a pick here where I'm like, we're on episode 834 of this program.

01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:15.740
You've been doing this segment since episode 250 because there were some prior things.

01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:20.740
There used to be like website of the week where there's some other things before we kind of landed on this, which is a great fit.

01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:31.740
And I'm stunned sometimes at some of the games that I see, like you'll send me your pick and I'm like, how have we not done that in like 600 episodes?

01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:32.740
How?

01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:34.740
I have that thought myself.

01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:35.740
I know, I know. It's crazy.

01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:40.740
And tonight is definitely one of those nights where I'm like, how has this never been a classic game?

01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:45.740
But that's not a negative. It just means we cover so much good stuff here, right?

01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:46.740
Right.

01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:55.740
We have a ton that we've done, and I'm a little bit disappointed in myself for not having done this earlier, but better late than never.

01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:57.740
You've done some other games.

01:21:57.740 --> 01:21:58.740
I've done others in the series.

01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:01.740
Yes, you definitely have, but just never this one.

01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:02.740
And that just surprised me.

01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:04.740
But that's OK. We're going to fix that tonight, right?

01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:05.740
C'est la vie.

01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:07.740
What is it?

01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:11.740
The game of the week is Street Fighter II The World Warrior.

01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:15.740
Of course, many of us have just known it as Street Fighter II.

01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:18.740
It is a fighting game developed by Capcom.

01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:23.740
It was originally released in arcades in 1991, and it is the second in the series.

01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:30.740
The very first being Street Fighter that came out in 1987 that was not as happy about it.

01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:38.740
It was the 14th title to use the CP system arcade board, and it improved so much over the first game,

01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:48.740
including the special command moves, six button configuration and adding better, more interesting characters with their own fighting style and a combo system.

01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:53.740
So this actually became the best selling title of it.

01:22:53.740 --> 01:23:07.740
I mean, probably since the golden age, 1994, the game had been played by over 25 million people in the US alone at home and in arcades.

01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:11.740
There have been updated versions since then, different variants on it.

01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:20.740
Because remember, before we had that Valve couldn't count to three, before it was Capcom couldn't count to three.

01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:28.740
So going into the game, basically you have your different fighters.

01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:35.740
We had, you know, just a few coming over from the original Street Fighter.

01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:48.740
And so your goal is to deplete the vitality bar of the other player by getting hits on them until they have no vitality left.

01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:59.740
If you do it at the same time, or you have an equal amount of life at the end of the match, then you get a double KO or a draw.

01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:03.740
You can get, you know, additional rounds if you have tied too many times.

01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:16.740
So, you know, so at any rate, if you could actually make a match last up to 10 rounds, if there was no clear winner, but when Champion Edition came out, it was reduced to four.

01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:29.740
And if there's no clear winner by the end of the final round, then the computer opponent, if you're playing versus the computer, will win by default, or both will lose in the two-player match.

01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:35.740
So after every third match in single-player mode, you will have a bonus stage.

01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:37.740
Oh my car!

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:41.740
Which was originally, oh my god, but they changed it, of course, in the US.

01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:56.740
The bonus round will have, in order, a car-breaking event that's very similar to the bonus rounds in Final Fight, the barrel-breaking bonus game, which I kind of hated, and then the drum-breaking bonus game, which I hated even more.

01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:58.740
I like beating up the car.

01:24:58.740 --> 01:25:08.740
Between the matches, you have a Pacific-centered world map that shows you where each of the home stages are, so you are traveling the world.

01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:14.740
You have an eight-directional joystick and six attack buttons.

01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:36.740
I don't really need to go into explanation on actually how it plays, but to go through the original characters, you had Mew, you had Ken, you had Edmund Honda, you had Guile, or people who couldn't pronounce Guile called him Wheely, which was stupid, and those people made me cry.

01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:40.740
Yeah, I hate, I'm like, can you not read?

01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:48.740
Anyway, there was Chun-Li, there was Blanca, Zangief, and Dalsim.

01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:55.740
And you had your CPU-exclusive characters, and I will be going by the Japanese names.

01:25:55.740 --> 01:26:02.740
You had Balrog, who in the US was Vega, a Spanish bullfighter.

01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:09.740
You had M. Bison after Mike Tyson, who was called, they switched him to Balrog in the US.

01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:20.740
You had Sagat, who is the Muay Thai fighter, and then Vega in Japan was called M. Bison here, which, meh.

01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:33.740
And so, of course, there was all kinds of just craziness that came out of this, different rumors and things, things that even made it into magazines as April Fool's jokes.

01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:35.740
I actually still have an issue with EGM somewhere.

01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:45.740
One of Ryu's quotes was, you must defeat Shenlong to stand a chance, which was supposed to be translated, you can't win if you can't beat my Dragon Punch.

01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:58.740
But they thought there was a character named Shenlong in the game, and this led to a big hoax, and EGM played on it, and then there are two characters at the intro who were named Scott Max.

01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:07.740
So, at any rate, you know, they've gone and the game really spawned stories and all kinds of crazy stuff.

01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:17.740
But the fun thing about this combo system, because this was one of the earliest games to actually have a combo system, and so many people worked on it,

01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:28.740
and the original developers didn't really prioritize the balance of the game, and they really put more of its properties and how animated it was,

01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:42.740
and how they could make it look, and how the characters would be able to, the characters actually took up different size, like Ryu was an 8 megabit and Zangief was 12 megabit, and the game took two years to develop.

01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:54.740
But about the car stage, and this is a quote from Hunamizu Noritaka, who said that they saw the punch timing and it was possible to add a second hit and so on,

01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:59.740
so they made, from a little bug maybe, they added in that combo system.

01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:10.740
And of course, most of the music was composed by Shinomura Yoko, and she actually left Capcom for Square two years later.

01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:19.740
But I mean, of course, we know she's done a lot of great work for Capcom in the past.

01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:32.740
I mean, just different things that she's worked on, you know, Final Fight, Gargoyle's Quest, you know, she's worked on popin' music, probably.

01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:33.740
Oh wow.

01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:40.740
Yeah, you know, but we've also had her for Nemo, just all kinds of games, she's done some really great stuff.

01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:48.740
And as I recall, she did, I think, my favorite music in Kingdom Hearts.

01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:52.740
I believe that she did the Tron music.

01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:54.740
She actually did a lot of music in Kingdom Hearts.

01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:55.740
Oh wow.

01:28:55.740 --> 01:28:56.740
Kingdom Hearts 2, sorry.

01:28:56.740 --> 01:29:07.740
So as far as different ports out of this game, and I'm not talking about, like, the various special editions and whatnot, championship edition, you name it.

01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:18.740
There was the Super Famicom version that was re-released for Wii and Wii U Virtual Console, that was in 1992.

01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:32.740
Also in 1992, we had Amiga, Atari ST, those came on floppy disk, Commodore 64 Rob on cassette or floppy disk, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, PC-DOS on three disks, ooh.

01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:46.740
In 1994, there was the CPS Changer, there was 1995 on Game Boy, 1997 Sega Master System, 98 Sega Saturn and PlayStation, with the Saturn version being greater, because it had 2D better.

01:29:46.740 --> 01:30:01.740
2004, it came out on mobile, 2005, PlayStation 2, Xbox, PSP, 28, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Windows, as part of the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection.

01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:06.740
The Super Nintendo One had some big changes made to it with its release.

01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:23.740
They removed the attract sequence, some of the voice samples had to be reduced, you could not necessarily get a lot out of the character vocalizations, but depending on their strength level, they went higher in pitch.

01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:25.740
I don't know if you ever knew that.

01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:41.740
The tunes in the soundtrack were also rearranged, and there were just some different attacks that were removed, like Chun-Li's standing medium punch.

01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:48.740
Two of the elephants from the Balsim stage, so yeah, it was really downscaled quite a bit, but it was still a really good game.

01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:55.740
And this, you know, the arcade version of this game got some amazing ratings from it.

01:30:55.740 --> 01:31:04.740
It was, you know, it was probably one of the higher ranked games that released at this time.

01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:09.740
Of course, we're popular worldwide, and now we're up to like freaking Street Fighter V.

01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:31.740
But for our different versions of Street Fighter II that were released, we had Street Fighter II The World Warrior, we had Special Champion Edition, Street Fighter II Turbo, Street Fighter II The New Challengers, and then there was Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix, Ultra Street Fighter II, we've just had so many.

01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:36.740
And like I said, the joke was, can a Capcom count to three? Oh, no.

01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:41.740
But I mean, it also has had such a big impact on just pop culture in general.

01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:53.740
The game has been sampled so many times for its music, even Nicki Minaj sampled, or actually referenced the game, will be a bunch of different folks.

01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:58.740
Yeah, Nicki Minaj's single was called Chun-Li, so that was a good song.

01:31:58.740 --> 01:32:11.740
You know, but who sampled list 80 songs that have sampled Street Fighter II, including Kanye, Jay-Z, Drake, all kinds of folks.

01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:17.740
And then there's also a British Grindel band called Hadoken.

01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:26.740
And I mean, it's just like I'm even just looking at the references page for all this, and it's almost as long as the article itself.

01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:39.740
It was such a huge piece of pop culture. Like, you know, you and I are a similar age, and I just remember how much this game dominated, you know, the early high school slash like late junior high kind of years.

01:32:39.740 --> 01:32:45.740
Like this was in every arcade. It was, you know, it was just like the game.

01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:53.740
And, you know, when it came out for Super Nintendo, because it came out there first before Genesis, it was a huge deal.

01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:59.740
Like it was a huge deal when this came out on Super Nintendo. Everybody was looking forward to it.

01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:08.740
It sold, I'm sure, Cuckoo Bananas crazy. They ended up doing Super Street Fighter, Turbo Street Fighter, all in the Super Nintendo as well.

01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:11.740
So, so well done.

01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:24.740
Well, and the other the other things about it apart from other things that it spawned is there have been different, I would probably say different other expansions to it.

01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:33.740
And in fact, the Street Fighter 2 characters became part of the G.I. Joe A Real American Hero line in 1993 because Hasbro bought the rights to the characters.

01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:43.740
There was an unofficial South Korean animation called Street Fighter that had the Street Fighter 2 and then there was a movie in Hong Kong called Future Cops.

01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:51.740
That was another, you know, rename of that. There were other adaptions for film, there was Street Fighter 2 the animated movie.

01:33:51.740 --> 01:34:01.740
There was the live action one with Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue and Raul Julia, which I happen to have seen four times in the theater because of reasons.

01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:15.740
And then there was also the US Street Fighter cartoon, which was terrible. Street Fighter 2V, the prequel series that was sort of, I guess, not quite Street Fighter Alpha.

01:34:15.740 --> 01:34:26.740
There was actually there was for for Street Fighter 4, there was even an animation that came out with that game.

01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:33.740
And then, of course, who can forget the Street Fighter sequence in City Cop? Was it City Cop? Yeah.

01:34:33.740 --> 01:34:37.740
Am I right? The Jackie Chan movie?

01:34:37.740 --> 01:34:38.740
City Hunter.

01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:44.740
City Hunter, because I was thinking of the anime and for the life of me, I could not remember the name of it because I've watched a bunch of City Hunter.

01:34:44.740 --> 01:34:52.740
Yes, the anime was awesome. And then, of course, the live action movie is also awesome. And that Street Fighter sequence is really great.

01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:59.740
That sequence is like the memorable thing. And seeing, you know, Jackie Chan as Chun-Li was absolutely hilarious.

01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:09.740
But yeah, you know, this this game has been embedded into our pop culture. Even if you're not a gamer, you know what the hell Street Fighter 2 is.

01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:23.740
So, I mean, and thankfully it's not the old whack-a-mole, they opted not to use the whack-a-mole style, you know, game that the original Street Fighter was for a bit. So there you go.

01:35:25.740 --> 01:35:32.740
Let me ask you this crazy question. You know, this obviously was a game that came after, you know, it's Street Fighter 2 for a reason.

01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:37.740
There was a Street Fighter 1 that I don't think was quite ingrained into popular culture.

01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:44.740
And what's interesting is that Street Fighter 2 barely references the original Street Fighter. Like you said early on, most of the characters aren't here.

01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:47.740
You know, characters like Birdie and stuff, they're never...

01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:49.740
But they came back for Street Fighter Alpha.

01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:51.740
What's that? Oh yeah, they came later.

01:35:51.740 --> 01:36:04.740
Yeah, like Gen and all of those. But they were really expanded upon. You know, I think that they had to step away from how the initial game went.

01:36:04.740 --> 01:36:12.740
And like I said, that whack-a-mole thing was stupid, okay? I mean, I get the concept behind it, it's novel, but that's no way to play a game.

01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:20.740
And it's gonna, you know, basically mean that arcade owners are gonna have to replace their machines or their buttons and keep doing all kinds of other maintenance on it.

01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:30.740
But in the long run though, when going to a full joystick and button style, that's better for arcade operators, especially since it's using a particular system.

01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:39.740
You know, and then even with the later ones going into the CPS2 system, you have your ROM cartridges that you can replace and keep using that same system for multiple games.

01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:43.740
So it really was an innovation just in terms of gaming itself.

01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:53.740
Yeah, and I think also just like, I think what it brought to the arcades, the player versus player element, that I think a lot of games...

01:36:53.740 --> 01:36:59.740
I mean, certainly that existed in other games, but like that was the core of this game.

01:36:59.740 --> 01:37:11.740
And I think there was something about that that really lended itself to the popularity of this game and really paved the way for so many games that either tried to copy it or just were inspired by it.

01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:15.740
I would say Mortal Kombat being the most obvious example. Obviously, Mortal Kombat is its own thing.

01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:19.740
I'm not saying that it's trying to bite off of Street Fighter, but it wouldn't exist if it weren't for Street Fighter.

01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:22.740
Exactly.

01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:28.740
Yeah, so, all right. Well, there it is, your classic game of the week. It's one of those, it's about time type of selections.

01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:34.740
But you know what? No, I mean, like I said earlier, we just sometimes we're highlighting so many other games.

01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:41.740
So many games have been made over the years. We finally got around to Street Fighter 2 tonight. Great pick. Appreciate that.

01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:45.740
All right, let's move on. We've got some more news to get into.

01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:51.740
And then we're going to take some comments from our chat room as we get to the listener roundtable a little later in the show.

01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:56.740
But let's get to some rapid fire news and talk about some other things that are going on in the industry right now.

01:37:57.740 --> 01:38:04.740
Yeah, so let's talk about some of the games that are going to be coming to PlayStation Plus next month, or I should even say in a couple days.

01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:12.740
So, speaking of Street Fighter, we're going to be getting Street Fighter 5, which is going to be arriving tomorrow on September 1st.

01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:19.740
And also PUBG is going to be the other free game as well. So, pretty cool.

01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:28.740
And then also there is some updates regarding Marvel Avengers, and I can't say that they're good updates.

01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:33.740
It's talking about their battle pass system and cosmetics and all that stuff.

01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:44.740
So, like a lot of the popular games nowadays, they're doing this kind of like season pass type of, well, not necessarily season pass.

01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:58.740
I guess sort of like the skill tree that you would see in like Fortnite or in Fall Guys, for example, where you have to unlock things in order to unlock each of the cosmetics in there.

01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:07.740
Well, to be able to do that, you have to purchase a challenge, a hero challenge card, which is going to be 1000 credits or $10.

01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:11.740
And that's per hero that you want to unlock that stuff.

01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:24.740
Now, they say that at the end of it, though, you do earn your 1000 credits back, but that's after you grind through everything in order to unlock all of that, which I'm guessing is probably going to be quite a slog.

01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:36.740
Aside from that, they're going to also have, of course, the credit packs that they're selling, that they're going to be selling different items that are going to rotate on a weekly basis.

01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:48.740
I don't know. I don't need when you have like a huge article in this, this is even coming from Square Enix discussing how the monetization is going to work.

01:39:48.740 --> 01:39:53.740
We'll take your money here. We'll take your money there. We'll take your money anywhere we can get it.

01:39:53.740 --> 01:39:59.740
We don't even know like how good this game is going to be. And it doesn't seem like a lot of people are very impressed with it so far.

01:39:59.740 --> 01:40:02.740
So why are we getting into the monetization?

01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:13.740
I mean, they did keep saying that it's optional and it's just cosmetic, but no, I'm not. This just turns me off of this game even more.

01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:21.740
But it's a concern. We should be getting more, you know, on the great features in the game and reasons why we're going to enjoy it.

01:40:21.740 --> 01:40:25.740
I just it seems a little tacky to be talking about. Here's how we're going to take all your money.

01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:30.740
Like, I understand, like, and I will say I'm glad they are talking about it up front.

01:40:30.740 --> 01:40:36.740
I'm glad they're getting ahead of because, you know, if this was all kind of exposed when the game was released.

01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:39.740
For our benefit, they're doing it to try to save face.

01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:45.740
Yes. Yes, exactly. Exactly. But I'm glad we're getting it now and not later, I guess, as a result.

01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:53.740
So, all right. Other rapid fire things. Spotify is trying to amp up their e-sports offerings.

01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:56.740
They're doing a partnership with Riot Games.

01:40:56.740 --> 01:41:06.740
And so now Riot will be working with Spotify, I guess, exclusively when it comes to League of Legends, including a new League of Legends related podcast and e-sports.

01:41:06.740 --> 01:41:10.740
So there's no launch date for when the podcast will kick off yet.

01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:13.740
But it is something that they are working on for this year.

01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:21.740
There's also going to be some type of official hub in Spotify that will have gaming music, podcasts and playlists, including the official League of Legends.

01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:24.740
And this is League of Legends playlists. And, you know, I have to say that.

01:41:24.740 --> 01:41:30.740
And by the way, this is nothing new for Spotify. They've been really trying to amp up the representation of podcasts on there.

01:41:30.740 --> 01:41:34.740
You can subscribe to OLR there if you want, as well as many other great podcasts.

01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:42.740
But they are, you know, one of the big, big shows they just got recently. Michelle Obama just launched a podcast on Spotify.

01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:46.740
And I don't endorse celebrity podcasts very often because I'm very much.

01:41:46.740 --> 01:41:52.740
And even when I'm reading this, I'm like, I bet there's a lot of fan run League of Legends podcasts that are worth your time.

01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:59.740
You don't have to do the official one. But I will say, if there's any celebrity podcast I'm going to endorse, the Michelle Obama one is really good.

01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:05.740
I mean, she's just such a good speaker anyway. Everybody was talking about her speech, you know, at the DNC and so forth.

01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:10.740
And she's just so, so well spoken that it lends itself. It's kind of like when she had a podcast.

01:42:10.740 --> 01:42:14.740
It's one of those things where it's like, I'm surprised it took this long.

01:42:14.740 --> 01:42:20.740
I mean, I'm surprised we had to wait this long for this. So that was that was a great land in Spotify's world.

01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:26.740
The one other thing I will say, though, with this whole League of Legends talk and Spotify, though, I can't believe we had that whole article.

01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:35.740
And whole discussion and not a word about KDA, because I don't know if you all have heard that new KDA song, but it's fire.

01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:39.740
It's fire. It's so good. There's a new one. Yeah, the baddest. Check it out.

01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:47.740
It's it's really good. And it's that same kind of like K-pop and American pop fusion that pop stars was.

01:42:47.740 --> 01:42:52.740
And they are going to be doing an EP at some point this year. I think they've changed some of the singers.

01:42:52.740 --> 01:42:57.740
I think some folks were maybe brought into pop stars thinking it was just going to be a one song thing.

01:42:57.740 --> 01:43:03.740
So they've changed the lineup a little bit. But, you know, it's like the Pussycat Dolls, right?

01:43:03.740 --> 01:43:07.740
Yeah. At the end of the day, it was Nicole Scherringer and whoever else was there.

01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:13.740
Right. Destiny's Child. It was. Does anyone remember when Destiny's Child was four people?

01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:16.740
Anyway, it was Beyonce and her friends. All right.

01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:21.740
Moving on. Let's talk about everybody. All right.

01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:24.740
One other rapid fire thing I want to talk about. Twitch.

01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:29.740
September is coming back. No talk about any restaurant chain partnering with this.

01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:34.740
However, September is coming back. September 1st at 10 a.m. Eastern.

01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:37.740
You're going to be able to get some savings on channel subscriptions.

01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:40.740
Twenty percent off the first month of the new subscription.

01:43:40.740 --> 01:43:43.740
Twenty five percent off a three month subscription.

01:43:43.740 --> 01:43:51.740
Thirty percent off a six month subscription. So, you know, if you have some channels that you're wanting to support.

01:43:51.740 --> 01:43:54.740
And you know, there's so many great content creators out there.

01:43:54.740 --> 01:44:01.740
Like, I'd be dumb not to try to put a cheap plug for ourselves, but I'm sure there are many great content creators on Twitch that you're watching.

01:44:01.740 --> 01:44:04.740
And September is going to be a great time to stock up on that.

01:44:04.740 --> 01:44:10.740
If you want to do that, even though there will be a discount for you to sign up for these subs.

01:44:10.740 --> 01:44:13.740
The streamer themselves will still get the same share of the pie.

01:44:13.740 --> 01:44:16.740
So Twitch is absorbing that discount, which is a great thing.

01:44:16.740 --> 01:44:21.740
They aren't trying to force their discount on the streamer like their Grubhub.

01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:24.740
OK. Or one of those services. Anyway.

01:44:24.740 --> 01:44:32.740
So, yes, that's pretty cool. So you can bet we're going to try to push subs come September because it'll be a little cheaper.

01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:36.740
But please support all your favorite content creators. There's many great ones out there.

01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:39.740
Including one that just showed up in our chat room, Black Compat.

01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:46.740
I urge you to follow our pals formerly of Electric Sistahood on their new venture over there.

01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:50.740
And I know there are many other folks as well that are streaming in this day and age.

01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:55.740
DJ Rama S, I'm sure would love it if you would follow Anime Jam Session.

01:44:55.740 --> 01:44:59.740
And we would love that, too, because they are our friends here at the Voice of the Youth Network.

01:44:59.740 --> 01:45:02.740
So anyway, let's move on.

01:45:02.740 --> 01:45:05.740
Other rapid fire news from Dark Sakura.

01:45:05.740 --> 01:45:09.740
Yeah, it is very sad, but Sega has confirmed the end of Sega ages.

01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:14.740
However, they're going to be doing more stuff for Switch and revisiting past titles.

01:45:14.740 --> 01:45:22.740
But it was confirmed in Game Watch from Okunari Yosuke basically said that there's no future plan for.

01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:31.740
Oh, hot dog for. Sorry, my husband brought me food for any other any other games in the future.

01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:35.740
The last one they did was here's a spy.

01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:41.740
But, you know, they said there's more stuff from M2 that might be out.

01:45:41.740 --> 01:45:46.740
And then also Streets of Rage 4 is getting some new content.

01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:48.740
But we don't know when.

01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:52.740
The Streets of Rage 4 is getting some new content, but we don't know when.

01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:58.740
They're not telling us. They just said, yeah, it's happening. You'll find out eventually.

01:45:58.740 --> 01:46:02.740
Suck on it. Not really.

01:46:02.740 --> 01:46:04.740
Look forward to it. Please look forward to it.

01:46:04.740 --> 01:46:10.740
That marinates in Streets of Rage 4 as it is, which is like as far as like throwback titles go,

01:46:10.740 --> 01:46:15.740
for better or for worse, Streets of Rage is a throwback title.

01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:22.740
It's all the great things about 90s arcade beat em ups and all the things that feel a little stale about them in the year 2020 as well.

01:46:22.740 --> 01:46:24.740
But you know what? I think it's a great throwback.

01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:26.740
Streets of Rage was Yuzo Koshiro.

01:46:26.740 --> 01:46:31.740
No, of course, I know. Oh, yeah. And the music's fire, of course, is one of the best reasons to check it out.

01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:34.740
All right. Let's travel. Oh, I'm sorry.

01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:37.740
Let's travel around the world and check out some releases coming out this week.

01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:40.740
So we'll start in the US with Loki.

01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:43.740
All right. So this week we've got a few things.

01:46:43.740 --> 01:46:52.740
So starting off with R.A. and the Secret of Seasons on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:56.740
Not to be confused with Ori and the whatever, whatever.

01:46:56.740 --> 01:47:01.740
Yes. No, not to be confused with that. Crusader Kings 3 on PC, Mac and Linux.

01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:06.740
Iron Harvest on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:47:06.740 --> 01:47:15.740

01:47:15.740 --> 01:47:20.740
Tell me why. Chapter two on PC and Xbox One.

01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:25.740
WRC9 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:29.740
Doraemon Story of Seasons on PlayStation 4.

01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:34.740
Marvel's Avengers on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Stadia.

01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:41.740

01:47:41.740 --> 01:47:49.740
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:47:49.740 --> 01:47:53.740
World's End Club on iOS. That's it.

01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:57.740
All right. Let's talk about Japan. So some of the releases in Japan this week.

01:47:57.740 --> 01:48:03.740
Slay the Spire gets a localized release in Japan this week on September 3rd for Nintendo Switch.

01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:08.740
And then also coming out in Japan, NBA 2K21. It's coming out there as well.

01:48:08.740 --> 01:48:13.740
I guess it gets a world release of sorts. And Minecraft Dungeons gets a release on the Switch in Japan this week.

01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:19.740
So they're catching up a little bit on some of the things that we've had here for a bit. So check that out.

01:48:19.740 --> 01:48:22.740
On the PlayStation 4, we also have some releases.

01:48:22.740 --> 01:48:27.740
We have Marvel's Avengers gets its Japanese release this week.

01:48:28.740 --> 01:48:33.740
As well as I think that might be it actually in Japan this week.

01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:37.740
I would have thought some of those. Oh, there it is. NBA 2K20. I was like, surely that's there.

01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:39.740
NBA 2K21 is out in Japan this week as well.

01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:45.740
And Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 also gets a combined release there in Japan this week.

01:48:45.740 --> 01:48:49.740
Pretty cool. Dark Sakura, how about the UK?

01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:54.740
Are you muted, Dark Sakura? Or am I just not here?

01:48:54.740 --> 01:48:59.740
I am now. OK, I was. I was eating a hot dog because my husband loves me.

01:48:59.740 --> 01:49:03.740
I understand. Yes, he feeds his wife.

01:49:03.740 --> 01:49:13.740
So anyway, on the 31st, there's a bunch of stuff, by the way. On the 31st, we have MX vs ATV All Out.

01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:22.740
On Switch, we have Crusader Kings 3 for PC, Marvel's Avengers Deluxe Edition, Marvel's Avengers Earth's Mightiest Edition.

01:49:22.740 --> 01:49:28.740
And on September 2nd, we have WRC 9 on the third.

01:49:28.740 --> 01:49:33.740
This is pretty much everything else is coming out on the third road to Guangdong.

01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:44.740
Wiley Jetman, Astro Monkey's Revenge Sweeper Edition, NBA 2K21, The Sojourn, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2, The Persistence Hode, Ministry of Broadcast.

01:49:44.740 --> 01:49:46.740
That just sounds like a cool name.

01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:52.740
Marvel's Avengers, Minecraft Dungeons, Kingdoms of Amalur Re-Reckoning.

01:49:52.740 --> 01:49:57.740
Oh, actually, I'm getting way past that. Those last two were from the seventh. OK, I'm done.

01:49:57.740 --> 01:50:03.740
You know what? We're not here next week, so it's OK. You give them a sneak peek of what to look forward to in a couple of weeks.

01:50:03.740 --> 01:50:09.740
Alright, well then also, Ninja Legends on the 10th, Initial Drift, Holy Potatoes Compendium.

01:50:09.740 --> 01:50:11.740
And that's all I'm going to do.

01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:17.740
Every potato is holy, in my opinion. Alright, except I'm not as big on sweet potatoes.

01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:20.740
I'm going to be honest. I know it's a big thing for some people, not really.

01:50:20.740 --> 01:50:23.740
I'm a big fan of purple mountain yams.

01:50:23.740 --> 01:50:30.740
Alright, let's move on with some more stories and then we'll get to the listener roundtable. First off, Loki.

01:50:30.740 --> 01:50:37.740
Alright, so there's a new mobile AR game coming because there's not enough of those.

01:50:37.740 --> 01:50:45.740
This time it is in the Witcher universe, so it's the Witcher Monster Slayer.

01:50:45.740 --> 01:50:52.740
And it's your typical AR game where you're going to be fighting monsters and in the first person.

01:50:52.740 --> 01:50:58.740
Kind of reminds me a little bit of that Walking Dead AR game that they had.

01:50:58.740 --> 01:51:04.740
I don't know if it's the same company that puts it out, but yeah, it looks OK.

01:51:04.740 --> 01:51:14.740
I mean, obviously the trailer they show of it doesn't really show you anything in like literally less than a second of the gameplay there, but I don't know.

01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:20.740
Yeah, so it's being developed by Spocco, who I have never heard of.

01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:29.740
But yeah, apparently that is the new hotness in the location gaming space.

01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:39.740
We'll see. I mean, some of those games come out like garbage, like Garfield Go. Remember that one? That was a real piece of work.

01:51:39.740 --> 01:51:45.740
Some people were, and there was a Ghostbusters game that I think kind of came and went pretty quick.

01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:49.740
There's a Walking Dead game that kind of came and went real quick.

01:51:49.740 --> 01:51:55.740
The Jurassic Park one, I played that for a little bit. It was OK. I didn't get super into it, but I know other people did.

01:51:55.740 --> 01:52:02.740
Like, I know people that will play Pokemon Go and that. See, I kind of found that my limit is three, and three is a lot.

01:52:02.740 --> 01:52:09.740
And if Pokemon didn't have the Bluetooth, I probably couldn't do three. But I play Ingress, I play Pokemon Go, and I play Orna.

01:52:09.740 --> 01:52:13.740
And those are the three I can do. I gave up Harry Potter. Harry Potter's gone.

01:52:13.740 --> 01:52:22.740
But that, you know, I know that's another popular AR game. That's also a Niantic-based one, so they've got a really great database of stuff in there.

01:52:22.740 --> 01:52:25.740
All right. We'll see how The Witcher turns out.

01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:37.740
I think the thing that makes the Niantic games really, really work is that the populated system of interesting places that, granted, is all user-made.

01:52:37.740 --> 01:52:41.740
And I know it has its problems in rural areas, but it's getting better.

01:52:41.740 --> 01:52:48.740
I think that population or that database of all those cool locations is what really boosts those games.

01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:56.740
Because then when you look at a game like Jurassic World or whatever, they're in random places. Everything's in random places.

01:52:56.740 --> 01:53:03.740
And the one thing I liked about Orna, or still like about Orna, is that you can build your own stuff in the world.

01:53:03.740 --> 01:53:11.740
And I would like to see more games like that, where you're literally building your own stuff that affects other players as well, if you wanted to.

01:53:11.740 --> 01:53:15.740
You can also keep it private, so that you're not giving away where your house is, which is a smart thing to do.

01:53:15.740 --> 01:53:22.740
But I like that, though. If you're limited on where, especially in a pandemic when you're supposed to be staying at home,

01:53:22.740 --> 01:53:28.740
I do like that you can build things nearby so that you have those resources.

01:53:28.740 --> 01:53:32.740
But at the same time, there's still things that you have to go out and find.

01:53:32.740 --> 01:53:36.740
So I like that quite a bit that they make it simple like that.

01:53:37.740 --> 01:53:47.740
So we'll see if The Witcher ends up being on the Harry Potter, pretty decent AR game side of things, Jurassic World, or on the Garfield side of things.

01:53:47.740 --> 01:53:58.740
Well, CD Projekt now, they own the majority stake in this company, so they probably will have quite a bit of influence on it. So hopefully that's a good thing.

01:53:58.740 --> 01:54:07.740
They must believe in it. Well, let's talk about the Game Awards for the year 2020, because the Game Awards take place every December.

01:54:07.740 --> 01:54:11.740
And Dark Soccer, are you okay?

01:54:11.740 --> 01:54:19.740
Your mute is in the wrong place, because I think we just heard what you didn't want us to hear, and now we don't hear you.

01:54:22.740 --> 01:54:24.740
You're still muted, my friend.

01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:27.740
Sorry, I bumped my mute button as I was burping.

01:54:27.740 --> 01:54:34.740
And I did it by complete accident, so now I'm a fucking lady, okay.

01:54:34.740 --> 01:54:37.740
Guess what, everybody, women burp.

01:54:37.740 --> 01:54:43.740
We fart, we take big huge dumps when we have to, we are human.

01:54:43.740 --> 01:54:44.740
Get over it.

01:54:47.740 --> 01:54:48.740
Alright.

01:54:50.740 --> 01:54:53.740
This lesson brought to you by Dark Sagra. Alright.

01:54:55.740 --> 01:54:56.740
Moving on.

01:54:57.740 --> 01:55:01.740
See, there is my mute button, and it is obnoxiously easy to hit.

01:55:01.740 --> 01:55:08.740
You know, this show has never been nominated for a Game Award, and I can't possibly imagine why.

01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:12.740
Because people often know who you are in order to be like an influencer.

01:55:12.740 --> 01:55:13.740
We got an award.

01:55:13.740 --> 01:55:20.740
We did, not a Game Award, we got a podcast award in like, what, 2004, but we...

01:55:21.740 --> 01:55:22.740
Alright.

01:55:22.740 --> 01:55:26.740
No, we love the awards that we've won and have been nominated for.

01:55:26.740 --> 01:55:32.740
I'll never forget that live 365 award ceremony where they forgot our name.

01:55:32.740 --> 01:55:37.740
And you can hear it in the recording when they're saying like, and nominated for Station of the Year.

01:55:37.740 --> 01:55:38.740
We have dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:44.740
And then like she starts to open the envelope and you hear Loki on the official recording in the back of the room.

01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:45.740
Hey!

01:55:45.740 --> 01:55:46.740
Hey!

01:55:49.740 --> 01:55:51.740
And she goes, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, and Orange Sounds Radio.

01:55:51.740 --> 01:55:53.740
And it was like, and that was the moment.

01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:56.740
I know, we were like, well, we didn't win, obviously.

01:55:57.740 --> 01:55:59.740
Guess we'll get another drink.

01:55:59.740 --> 01:56:00.740
I want something.

01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:01.740
I want the speakers.

01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:03.740
You want a, yeah, that's right.

01:56:03.740 --> 01:56:06.740
I'm glad we didn't all go home empty handed that night.

01:56:06.740 --> 01:56:14.740
Oh, yeah, I also got, what was it, like an IR remote, like a TV remote for my computer for some reason.

01:56:15.740 --> 01:56:17.740
I didn't get shit.

01:56:17.740 --> 01:56:26.740
I didn't get, the one thing I remember from that night as well, because we all, it's, you know, now that we all kind of have our, we all have our own things.

01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:29.740
So it's very rare and especially obviously we're in a pandemic.

01:56:29.740 --> 01:56:34.740
We don't get to do anything together now, but it's rarely that the three of us get to go on a complete adventure together.

01:56:34.740 --> 01:56:36.740
Like we went to PAX together that one year.

01:56:36.740 --> 01:56:37.740
That was a lot of fun.

01:56:37.740 --> 01:56:40.740
But we all went to the live 365 awards in the Bay Area together.

01:56:40.740 --> 01:56:54.740
And I remember when the car, we parked the car and the first space I wanted, I couldn't take because some fucking limo or something, or no, it wasn't even a limo, but just like a large car had took up like three parking spaces.

01:56:54.740 --> 01:56:57.740
And Dark Sakura goes, give me a, give me a post-it.

01:56:57.740 --> 01:56:58.740
You have post-its in here, right?

01:56:58.740 --> 01:57:03.740
And I'm like, I have Hello Kitty, Hello Kitty post-its and Dark Sakura was like, perfect.

01:57:03.740 --> 01:57:12.740
And she takes a piece of Hello Kitty stationary post-it and puts, you park like an asshole and puts it on the car.

01:57:12.740 --> 01:57:14.740
I still do that.

01:57:14.740 --> 01:57:25.740
But it's just, it wasn't just that you left a note that said you park like an asshole, but you put it on Hello Kitty stationary is what literally drives that home.

01:57:25.740 --> 01:57:27.740
Anyway, where were we?

01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:31.740
I need to, I actually do have a Hello Kitty stationary that I keep at my desk.

01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:34.740
I should just start carrying it with me and do that some more.

01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:35.740
All right.

01:57:35.740 --> 01:57:38.740
Anyhow, excuse me, back to the Game Awards.

01:57:38.740 --> 01:57:42.740
So a ceremony nobody will be parking at this year because it's going to be all virtual.

01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:43.740
It's the Game Awards.

01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:47.740
So 2020 Game Awards is going to be going virtual.

01:57:47.740 --> 01:57:54.740
Jeff Keeley confirmed this in a recent interview with IGN saying, quote, what I will say about is this.

01:57:54.740 --> 01:57:56.740
We have a very interesting plan for the show this year.

01:57:56.740 --> 01:57:57.740
We're definitely doing it.

01:57:57.740 --> 01:57:59.740
A lot of people are asking, are you delaying it?

01:57:59.740 --> 01:58:01.740
The Oscars are being postponed.

01:58:01.740 --> 01:58:02.740
Are you postponing the Game Awards?

01:58:02.740 --> 01:58:03.740
We are not.

01:58:03.740 --> 01:58:07.740
We'll share more in the coming weeks, but it's actually probably going to be our biggest show yet.

01:58:07.740 --> 01:58:12.740
We're not going to have 10,000 people in a room together, but I think you'll see a little bit of this with how we do Gamescom.

01:58:12.740 --> 01:58:15.740
We're definitely doing more than just me in a room announcing winners.

01:58:15.740 --> 01:58:19.740
I'm really passionate about still doing the show live versus something prerecorded.

01:58:19.740 --> 01:58:27.740
So, yeah, we're working on some scenarios for ways we can present the show live with a bit of a spectacle to people without the public being able to buy tickets to come to the show and things like that this year.

01:58:27.740 --> 01:58:36.740
You know, and I have to admit, like I, I don't think the show is going to lose that much without having the audience there live.

01:58:36.740 --> 01:58:41.740
In fact, in some ways, I kind of think that might be a detract from the show right now.

01:58:41.740 --> 01:58:53.740
So, I kind of think when they have to just focus on the nominees, the game announcements, the creators that will undoubtedly be there on Zoom and so forth, I think it could be a very interesting show this year.

01:58:53.740 --> 01:58:55.740
So, we'll see.

01:58:55.740 --> 01:58:59.740
Some comments from our Twitch chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:58:59.740 --> 01:59:05.740
Black Compat says, I'm interested to see what will be in the categories this year for the Game Awards.

01:59:05.740 --> 01:59:08.740
That's true because they do tend to mix up the categories.

01:59:08.740 --> 01:59:27.740
Are they going to maybe do something that relates to this whole maybe pandemic situation that we're in like best game to play in 2020 in the state of the world and it's Jackbox Party Pack Part Six, Jackbox Party Pack Part Five, Jackbox Party Pack Part Four, and so on.

01:59:27.740 --> 01:59:41.740
Bobby says, it's really just about the game announcements. Now the good thing is if they need less money they can spend more time on the awards. There is that too. So, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm curious to see what this looks like in virtual form.

01:59:41.740 --> 01:59:53.740
You know, and this kind of came up when we were talking about conventions and it was really on Bobby's show, because he was kind of talking about missing the in person conventions and there was a, there was a discussion that was happening in chat about how, you know,

01:59:53.740 --> 02:00:00.740
some people hoped that maybe the virtual convention idea stays around forever.

02:00:00.740 --> 02:00:15.740
And I think ultimately we all know you know we talked about what is the new normal. What is this world going to look like when we finally get to the other side of COVID and you know some some people say and reasonably so COVID will probably never go away.

02:00:15.740 --> 02:00:28.740
But we'll just get it under control like measles is a good example measles is not eradicated measles is still on this planet, but generally you don't have a problem with measles in the US because most people get vaccinated for it, and we reasonably have that disease

02:00:28.740 --> 02:00:42.740
under control. Hopefully that's where we get COVID to. But what does our new normal look like as a result of that and I know I've said on this show before, I think masks and wearing masks when you're sick and that I think we're going to see.

02:00:42.740 --> 02:00:55.740
I think we're going to see this country at least certain parts of this country big cities, because we all know there's people that are pushing back on masks. I'm not going to go there, but I think I think generally in the big cities, you're going to see us

02:00:55.740 --> 02:01:06.740
kind of picking up some cultural norms that have been done in Asia for a long time is that when people are sick and they're on the subway they're wearing a fucking mask, because people are going to own all these masks now.

02:01:06.740 --> 02:01:12.740
So, you know, I kind of think that will be around. But also, when to get to the point.

02:01:12.740 --> 02:01:22.740
I think some of the ways that we've adopted the virtual world, just like it's going to change our corporate jobs I think many more people are going to work from home now that they've proven they can do it.

02:01:22.740 --> 02:01:30.740
I think that's going to change the culture significantly not everybody's I can affect everybody at every job, but I think there are many organizations that are going to adopt more work at home.

02:01:30.740 --> 02:01:48.740
But I also think this idea of how do we blend the virtual with the in person. I think we're going to see a lot of that. After this, you know, most people know how to use zoom in this country after this point, which is a weird thing to think about but they

02:01:48.740 --> 02:02:00.740
they use zoom with schools they use zooms with work they use zoom with meetings, most, and whatever, insert Microsoft Teams Discord whatever you're using to video chat with people.

02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:12.740
That's going to be embedded in our culture so I just I kind of feel like whatever virtual form the game awards ends up taking this year. There may be a taste of that in future game awards.

02:02:12.740 --> 02:02:14.740
If that makes sense.

02:02:14.740 --> 02:02:20.740
Michael I've talked for a lot on that do I co host have any thoughts on that.

02:02:20.740 --> 02:02:22.740
I've seen already happening.

02:02:22.740 --> 02:02:24.740
How so.

02:02:24.740 --> 02:02:40.740
Well, just that because we are looking at, you know, you get more people saying, Oh, when do I tune into this online, you know, for example, we have a lot of that, or, you know, people just assuming already that it's not going to be an in person event.

02:02:40.740 --> 02:02:43.740
But mines are already leaning in that direction.

02:02:43.740 --> 02:02:52.740
And, you know, and I'm even, you know, just in talking to other people's like, Oh, I think I have a cold let me grab my mask.

02:02:52.740 --> 02:02:56.740
You know, I am seeing that a lot more often so it's happening. Yeah.

02:02:56.740 --> 02:03:08.740
And then some comments from our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network as she says, I can foresee cons and fests offering a digital only pass where you can see streamed panels from the show archive things and some interactive stuff.

02:03:08.740 --> 02:03:17.740
I can totally see that happening from this point on. It's just a revenue stream that can't be ignored. The only problem is infrastructure due to stream stuff from these events.

02:03:17.740 --> 02:03:28.740
Yeah, and you know even dragon con had the dragon con TV pass you could buy I think you had to still like they only sold it to people that actually attended dragon con Bobby correct me if I'm wrong but I feel like that was the thing.

02:03:28.740 --> 02:03:43.740
But I feel like maybe after this year. They, they may kind of have something a little more open with the I mean, obviously, nothing is going to be able to totally replace that being in the same room being there and all that.

02:03:43.740 --> 02:03:51.740
But I think this is really going to make us think about what can we also offer for the people who don't want to, or can't.

02:03:51.740 --> 02:03:57.740
And I kind of feel like that might get enhanced a little bit moving forward, we'll see. We'll see.

02:03:57.740 --> 02:03:58.740
All right.

02:03:58.740 --> 02:04:12.740
Let's move on. Anyway, I spent a lot of time on this topic. Let's move on. And Bobby Blackfield says dragon con TV never broadcast live on the internet. The on demand stuff was just repeats, and that's why they only sold it to the people that went anyway that's or I'm adding that part.

02:04:12.740 --> 02:04:22.740
And that makes sense. So, and DJ rama SS current infrastructure and most hotels and convention centers cannot handle high bandwidths of streaming content.

02:04:22.740 --> 02:04:29.740
I don't disagree with that. But I think due to all this.

02:04:29.740 --> 02:04:41.740
I don't think that is going to be an excuse that these convention centers can have much longer. They're going to have to get with the times and get that type of bandwidth, and I understand easier said than done.

02:04:41.740 --> 02:04:51.740
You can never totally foresee the amount and so on and so on but I do feel like this is something that that industry is going to struggle with and have to work with as we move back.

02:04:51.740 --> 02:04:58.740
Anyway, I do want to move on for time sake but some great great comments, a dark soccer What do we have next.

02:04:58.740 --> 02:05:08.740
Well, um, there is going to be another adaption for Resident Evil, but it's another live action series and it's going to be on Netflix.

02:05:08.740 --> 02:05:18.740
It was announced that it will be focused on the Wesker kids so I guess referring to Albert Wesker who's like, you know, one of the main bad guys.

02:05:18.740 --> 02:05:36.740
I understand that the first season will have eight one hour episodes it's actually written by one of the writers for Supernatural, Andrew Dabin, and the first two episodes will be directed by Bronwyn Hughes who did some walking dead and Breaking Bad.

02:05:36.740 --> 02:05:45.740
I don't know how I feel about it, just because I wish that they would go back and do something, you know, more based directly off of the games and not just like these little side stories.

02:05:45.740 --> 02:05:49.740
I mean, but they have to do they have to do to make money off of it I guess.

02:05:49.740 --> 02:05:59.740
But Resident Evil really is seeing this resurgence with all the game remake so it only, you know, stands to reason they try to you know milk that cow a little bit more.

02:05:59.740 --> 02:06:13.740
Yeah, and maybe, maybe doing the story like this kind of helps the series not get compared to the games, you know what I mean, like it's like, oh, they didn't do it that way because they did it in the games they got it wrong, like it's going to kind of avoid that

02:06:13.740 --> 02:06:23.740
by doing a separate story so that may be part of it right yeah but but at the same time I mean, we've got like two different continuity is now.

02:06:23.740 --> 02:06:33.740
Well, I'll be perfectly honest the things that I always enjoyed outside of the games were those CG movies that they did like degeneration.

02:06:33.740 --> 02:06:36.740
Those were fun. I love those.

02:06:36.740 --> 02:06:46.740
I actually I think I'm funny the first one of those that I watched was simply because it had on it's doing the soundtrack in it and I ended up loving the movie.

02:06:46.740 --> 02:06:48.740
So,

02:06:48.740 --> 02:06:56.740
I don't know, I mean, I don't really have a lot of hopes I didn't, you know, watch many of the movies past like a couple of them.

02:06:56.740 --> 02:07:16.740
So I don't really have a lot of notion preconceived notion for this one, although you know I love Supernatural so I like most of the writing for Supernatural so I am really looking forward to seeing if that same writing prowess, you know translates

02:07:16.740 --> 02:07:24.740
over to Resident Evil fairly well. I'm also very sad about this being the last season of Supernatural, I'm a little bitter, a little.

02:07:24.740 --> 02:07:28.740
It's been it's had a hell of a run they've been doing it 15 years they're allowed to retire.

02:07:28.740 --> 02:07:44.740
So, with Resident Evil though the Netflix, you know, video game stuffs really been hitting it out of the park recently between The Witcher and Castlevania, so I can see, you know, and we this subject has come up on the show before how it seems like there's

02:07:44.740 --> 02:07:57.740
just like this avalanche of gaming content about to be released because of the success of those things, such as we know there's a Final Fantasy 14 series in the works there's, there's plenty of other stuff to that it's just escaping me in the moment.

02:07:57.740 --> 02:08:11.740
There's lots of stuff that's in the works and I think Resident Evil is just the first one where it's like, oh, now we're seeing a picture of a script we're seeing some other details like the it's happening like that, you know, this is this is for real real now not just talk.

02:08:11.740 --> 02:08:22.740
Yeah, I don't know I, I'm gonna, I'd like to just with just about anything these days I, I would rather reserve my judgment that be super disappointed. Yeah, fair enough.

02:08:22.740 --> 02:08:26.740
All right, let's move on to our next story Loki.

02:08:26.740 --> 02:08:29.740
All right.

02:08:29.740 --> 02:08:38.740
So let's talk a little bit about Fall Guys, because that is a very popular game nowadays in fact it's so popular it's the most downloaded PlayStation Plus game ever.

02:08:38.740 --> 02:08:43.740
I played a little today, and lost on the second level, but I played a little.

02:08:43.740 --> 02:08:50.740
Yeah, I mean I'm sure a lot of that was because it was, you know, free obviously PlayStation Plus and everything but it's very popular.

02:08:50.740 --> 02:08:56.740
And then, of course, you know with season two right around the corner I'm sure it's just gonna become more popular.

02:08:56.740 --> 02:08:59.740
Of course, as most popular things are.

02:08:59.740 --> 02:09:17.740
They are modded into other games and so because of that, you know, the common games you would see mods for like Skyrim for example has a fallout or fall fall guys followers mod that you can get which is looks hilarious.

02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:23.740
And then of course there's also some Resident Evil three mods that allow you.

02:09:23.740 --> 02:09:29.740
It's called a jelly bean turns Jill Carlos and nemesis into beans.

02:09:29.740 --> 02:09:36.740
It looks pretty silly. So, I'm gonna have to definitely check out the one for Skyrim. Yeah, sounds funny.

02:09:36.740 --> 02:09:45.740
I would like to see you remember that mod that allows you to like roll 10,000 cabbages down a hill. How about 10,000 fall guys.

02:09:45.740 --> 02:09:52.740
10,000 cabbages that's not even a mod that's just just a game you can just spawn that stuff in.

02:09:52.740 --> 02:09:57.740
I'd like to see 10,000 fall guys falling down the hill will be fun. Sounds good. All right.

02:09:57.740 --> 02:10:10.740
Lastly, before we get to wrapping things up tonight. Bobby Black Wolf, are you out there you paying attention because I've got a story for you. And this is going to definitely be a game of the year contender for you.

02:10:10.740 --> 02:10:24.740
Okay, there's a little bit of an inside joke here that is really been beaten into the ground over the past few years. But how about one more inside joke for Nino Cooney because Nino Cooney, they just announced this week is going to be getting an MMO.

02:10:24.740 --> 02:10:38.740
It's called Nino Cooney cross worlds, and I do I feel like the story, maybe Bobby Black Wolf inspired because wait till you hear this in the game now, Nino Cooney explores like the link between worlds that's what this is about.

02:10:38.740 --> 02:10:44.740
But in this game you are going to be a VR game beta tester.

02:10:44.740 --> 02:10:48.740
That's right, VR is part of the plot you pay attention Bobby.

02:10:48.740 --> 02:11:03.740
I've already lost interest, but this game, you just well the game itself isn't VR but it's part of the story. So you are playing the role of a VR game beta tester and you discover the world of the VR game is real.

02:11:03.740 --> 02:11:26.740
Right, it's kinda, it's kinda dot hack like that. I was just about to say that. So anyway, it's only been confirmed for Japanese iOS and Android phones, but I'm sure our pal Bobby would appreciate it if you would start your hashtag campaigns to ensure that we get an English and localized release for this game as well.

02:11:26.740 --> 02:11:33.740
There's no exact date or anything like that. But, I mean, it does look, it looks not it looks pretty.

02:11:33.740 --> 02:11:45.740
I only think it's kind of disappointing because I'm like wow, this is so pretty I'd want to play it on a console, but okay the mobile phones get to have good things once in a while, and again if it's designed for mobile phones, it might not be such a bad mobile

02:11:45.740 --> 02:12:00.740
phone game. Games that are designed with the phone in mind tend to do all right so I'm curious. We will see. Anyway, what's that, Rob. There are really beautiful people who are garbage inside their hearts.

02:12:00.740 --> 02:12:11.740
It looks pretty is not an indication of how good that game is going to be. That, that is, that is very true. Yeah, yeah, just saying research your judgment don't get too excited.

02:12:11.740 --> 02:12:23.740
Yeah, that's true. There's a very, especially this year. I don't know, it's like everyone 2020 all I was like, shut up about politics Rob shut up about politics Rob show up about okay I can't help myself.

02:12:23.740 --> 02:12:36.740
Okay, so like, what's her name, the ex wife of Gavin Newsom that gave that speech, where she looked like she was Madonna and Evita going.

02:12:37.740 --> 02:12:41.740
Like if I was actually more thinking of Ivanka.

02:12:41.740 --> 02:12:52.740
If she's a very, she's a very pretty, pretty smart person if I pass garbage, if I pass them on the street, I would be like she's really pretty. I bet that's a great wig.

02:12:52.740 --> 02:12:54.740
Your makeup is beautiful.

02:12:54.740 --> 02:13:01.740
But, you know. All right, anyway. Oh, let's get some comments from Bobby Blackwell.

02:13:01.740 --> 02:13:06.740
Bobby Blackwell for saying I Nino Cooney trying too hard. Stay in Japan.

02:13:06.740 --> 02:13:15.740
Hashtag say Nino to Nino Cooney MMO in America.

02:13:15.740 --> 02:13:19.740
Say Nino nice to Nino Cooney that's a good one Bobby.

02:13:19.740 --> 02:13:26.740
You had to know that was coming for 12345 stories, so you marinating on that one.

02:13:26.740 --> 02:13:42.740
I love it. All right. Anyhow, let's move on. It's time for the listener roundtable if you guys have any questions, ask away in our chat anything that we have or maybe haven't talked about yet tonight on the show, please feel free to pop that in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network.

02:13:42.740 --> 02:14:01.740
We would also take this opportunity to check our mailbag every week you guys can email us participate at orange lounge radio.com, but I believe in checking with postmaster dark Sakura, who's a better postmaster than the one that's running the you anyway, the mailbag is empty right.

02:14:01.740 --> 02:14:13.740
Yeah. All right, bummer. Well maybe next week participate at orange lounge radio.com. However, I will take this opportunity to mention we had a comment over at vog network.com on last week's show.

02:14:13.740 --> 02:14:18.740
But before I get to that comment I think Loki you have an obligation to have to step away right.

02:14:18.740 --> 02:14:28.740
Yes I do refrigerator drama. All right. Oh boy, well the garage that needs to be in the kitchen. All right, we have to replace our refrigerator soon so it'll be my turn next probably.

02:14:28.740 --> 02:14:34.740
All right, well I hope everything's okay. Did you have any last minute, or I'm sorry not last sorry. Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight.

02:14:34.740 --> 02:14:42.740
No, just have a good week. I'll see you in a few weeks. Oh yeah, we'll see you in two weeks Loki, thank you and good luck with refrigerator drama.

02:14:42.740 --> 02:14:43.740
Right.

02:14:43.740 --> 02:14:57.740
All right. And then it was just me and dark soccer here on discord the discord image will fix itself in a moment here, but I do want to read this comment here from e three v l because you can leave comments over at vog network.com on episodes, and I haven't

02:14:57.740 --> 02:15:12.740
always been great about reading those on air, but since we've tried to consolidate the roundtable a little bit it reminds me to check on that. So I will point out e three v l commented on the last episode fall guys is free on PS plus, as long as you have a subscription,

02:15:12.740 --> 02:15:26.740
you must claim it by the end of the month so yeah time is running out on that by the way and I think I saw in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network black compat said, haven't downloaded it yet but plan to and yeah I would get on that my friend, because he

02:15:26.740 --> 02:15:38.740
had tomorrow I think is the last day you're gonna be able to grab that. So, get out because, yeah, I don't know if they expected fall guys to do as well as it has. So it's only going to be a matter of time before they want to start charging money for that again

02:15:38.740 --> 02:15:55.740
so, but thank you for that e three v l and also of importance, e three v l gives their Animal Crossing new horizons island dream code for us to visit, potentially on the next episode of Animal Crossing lounge radio, which I need to check and make sure nobody else

02:15:55.740 --> 02:16:05.740
is using that title I just figured why would anyone use Animal Crossing lounge radio, you would do you do you remember my spin off show courthouse.

02:16:05.740 --> 02:16:11.740
Yeah. Did you know that at one point I considered calling that show Warcraft lounge radio.

02:16:11.740 --> 02:16:25.740
And you know what, what another another show started the week before courthouse did called Warcraft lounge radio. I don't know if there's, I don't know if they're still going on what we don't we don't own the patent on lounge radio.

02:16:25.740 --> 02:16:39.740
They can do it was a fine. It was a fine show I have nothing negative to say about it is one of those I hope nobody beat us to it. Yeah. Anyway, maybe some, maybe somebody, maybe Tiger claws looking right now maybe.

02:16:39.740 --> 02:16:53.740
I don't know who knows. Anyway, act deft in talking about the refrigerator issues that Loki is having says if only it were easy to move stuff like an Animal Crossing, everything turns into a leaf.

02:16:53.740 --> 02:17:05.740
That's right, except with my luck I'd keep picking the wrong thing. Like I would be trying to pick up this desk and I tried to pick it up and then all of a sudden I just pulled the posters down from the wall.

02:17:05.740 --> 02:17:07.740
So, anyway.

02:17:07.740 --> 02:17:19.740
Bobby Blackwell says Google has no results for Warcraft lounge radio. Well, they might have pod faded they, this was, you know, courthouse was 2012, so it'd be pretty impressive if they were still going but I really don't know what about Animal Crossing

02:17:19.740 --> 02:17:22.740
lounge radio. That's the one I, by the way.

02:17:22.740 --> 02:17:31.740
You might be interested to know that I finally on Facebook retired the game archive to the danger squad group.

02:17:31.740 --> 02:17:35.740
Oh, that's kind of sad that was our old Warcraft Guild.

02:17:36.740 --> 02:17:52.740
I understand, I understand why you archive did I was like 10 years ago we were all rating there but it's always, it's always a moment of, oh, you know, you know what else I found, what's that I found the the thing that that.

02:17:52.740 --> 02:17:57.740
Why can I not remember his nickname. Now, well quickly.

02:17:57.740 --> 02:18:06.740
Bobby with a follow up saying the only results for Animal Crossing lounge radio is what came up on vog is vog stuff from our one episode we did so yay.

02:18:06.740 --> 02:18:18.740
Slidekick. I do not know why I cannot remember his nickname because I was thinking of the drag name. He's also first mate slide kick on game buoy although their episodes have been unfortunately very sporadic in the pandemic but we understand.

02:18:18.740 --> 02:18:27.740
Well, we had an idea for doing a comic. And I think you might remember this called Hills Brad blues.

02:18:27.740 --> 02:18:33.740
And I just found all the, all the renders I pulled like you know five year old renders.

02:18:33.740 --> 02:18:37.740
And the first panel of the comic we did.

02:18:38.740 --> 02:18:53.740
We kind of flew by it at the top of the show but one of the things that was announced at that Gamescom event was that the official date for shadow lands the next Warcraft expansion is out which is October 27 I believe these are 27th in Europe, but I think

02:18:53.740 --> 02:19:01.740
because of time zones it's actually like the, the 26th in the evening here, but we we have a general date for when that's coming out.

02:19:01.740 --> 02:19:14.740
I, I don't know if it's gonna get me to play though, yeah, and that's where my head's at is that like I, I think I'm kind of done with wow but I don't know then if I, then I'm going to hear everybody, because I had that show Horde house.

02:19:14.740 --> 02:19:26.740
I made a lot of Warcraft community friends. I went to BlizzCon and and did one of the pre events, years ago and I had a great time and I still have many friends I made in that community are just good people.

02:19:26.740 --> 02:19:34.740
And I feel like when they all start lying about it on Twitter. It's gonna make me want to go.

02:19:34.740 --> 02:19:38.740
Yes, it's FOMO right.

02:19:38.740 --> 02:19:50.740
And I'll be honest, the biggest thing that really pushed me away from playing well from really enjoying it was the shit they pulled with Sylvanas, and I'm like, I'm done. Yeah, done. Yeah.

02:19:50.740 --> 02:20:00.740
No more. I cannot stand it. As much as I freaking love that, you know, I had all this fun Illidan stuff and I was really getting into it I was so happy. And then they fucked over Sylvanas.

02:20:00.740 --> 02:20:14.740
Yeah, and took away my demon elf husband. It was, it was really weird how they handled her story so I don't know I guess I'm gonna wait and see but I also feel like one MMO is really truly enough and you know FOMO SC 14 is just kind of where I'm at.

02:20:14.740 --> 02:20:18.740
Do you know how many I might be. I'm still considering Star Trek online.

02:20:18.740 --> 02:20:28.740
That's fun. Yeah, I, um, the folks that were with a starboard power coupling I know that show hasn't been out in a while but it was, it was a show here at vogue for a while.

02:20:28.740 --> 02:20:41.740
Can Dr. Ken plays that game still pretty regularly I think and enjoys it so I made some really good friends, because when I was playing it I was super unemployed are fun employed.

02:20:41.740 --> 02:20:56.740
And so I was playing late night and so most people I played with were in the UK and I'm still really good friends with a couple of people that that I played with a good architect friend lives in Edinburgh, so it's pretty fun.

02:20:57.740 --> 02:20:59.740
Um, question in our chat.

02:20:59.740 --> 02:21:13.740
Fat Ninja DM in chat asks, will you guys and gals be playing New World when it releases next year that is the Amazon MMO that they've been working on for forever. So I'm gonna, I'm gonna admit that game was not on my radar.

02:21:13.740 --> 02:21:24.740
But I don't know, are they having an open beta or a closed beta something's going on with that game right now because I see people on Twitch streaming it, and one of my friends was streaming it the other night, and I have to say, it wasn't on my radar

02:21:24.740 --> 02:21:41.740
but when I watched my friend stream I was like, okay, this looks interesting. I kind of like the way the magic was was kind of neat, like he was his character was up on a hill, and he was launching fireballs like they were bow and arrow down on this other group

02:21:41.740 --> 02:21:55.740
of people like literally raining fire on them. And I was like, okay, that's like you know yes in Warcraft you also rain fire on people but it doesn't, it doesn't have that same feel that like of like oh there's like physics involved in this, this whole thing.

02:21:55.740 --> 02:22:07.740
So, it kind of looked neat, I have to admit, my, my curiosity was not piqued until I saw it being played on Twitch, which happens right Twitch has been a great way to sample games right.

02:22:08.740 --> 02:22:11.740
I really don't care about it.

02:22:11.740 --> 02:22:16.740
And the big reason I don't care about it is because I don't want to care about it.

02:22:16.740 --> 02:22:32.740
Right now, I have so much on my plate and such a backlog and I really want to get into more familiar territory with some of the games that I'm playing just things that are fun to me, and I don't really want to try anything super new in that respect that makes sense.

02:22:32.740 --> 02:22:48.740
It does. It's like when you eat the same thing for lunch every day because it's really good and it makes you happy. Yeah, I'm doing I'm in the same game. I get that but, and, and probably you know it's not just because it's not Animal Crossing because I've got other games that I'm playing I have other things I'm looking forward to.

02:22:48.740 --> 02:22:57.740
But I don't want to dip my toes into another MMO universe when I'm not doing any MMOs right now.

02:22:57.740 --> 02:23:08.740
There's also and there's a big difference between the commitment for like an MMO, and the commitment for a game that like I recommended to you earlier in the show I think telling lies would be something up your alley.

02:23:08.740 --> 02:23:21.740
Well, you can you can experience telling lies in like two three hours. You know, I'm not saying you're gonna get, but I think there's a bit there's that level of commitment, and I get that is that like you know I don't I don't have time to get sucked into another

02:23:21.740 --> 02:23:32.740
MMO, but you know I do have time for this, this other little this puzzle game I can play in a short burst fall guys I can play for five minutes and be done with it, you know, or whatever it is.

02:23:32.740 --> 02:23:44.740
And I can actually do some well on my own, how I got to level at in well by myself remember with anybody without doing a single dungeon.

02:23:44.740 --> 02:23:48.740
You know I just did them all by myself, I like.

02:23:48.740 --> 02:23:58.740
It's just the thing is that I don't, you know, it was kind of probably have a Final Fantasy 14 at first was that I couldn't just be through the, you know, do stuff in the game by myself and level that way effectively.

02:23:58.740 --> 02:24:02.740
It kind of made me do that for the quest lines.

02:24:02.740 --> 02:24:15.740
But you know Star Trek online, I could go in and just, you know, if I wanted to just futz around I could just you know take myself over to most of my characters probably still at quarks on Deep Space Nine.

02:24:15.740 --> 02:24:27.740
But you know I could was some with something like that I could just sort of, you know, play around in it, you know, have like a good 10 minutes of just exploring doing a couple battles, going to plan it, boom I'm done.

02:24:27.740 --> 02:24:39.740
And that was it. I don't really want to involve myself in a new MMO, and have to commit myself to learning its environment learning, it's.

02:24:39.740 --> 02:24:56.740
It's a culture, because you know you're in a memo it's gonna have its own culture built into the game if it's any fucking good. So I really don't want to have to expose myself to that quite yet when there are other MMOs that I have enjoyed in the past

02:24:56.740 --> 02:25:00.740
that I could be revisiting if I wanted to, which I do not.

02:25:00.740 --> 02:25:10.740
And SJ100Matt has a good comparison here in chat saying it's like starting a new TV series with five plus seasons that you haven't seen, but everyone has seen it's a large commitment.

02:25:10.740 --> 02:25:15.740
There are some shows you can't just have in the background that you have to focus on like Game of Thrones.

02:25:15.740 --> 02:25:29.740
And yeah, like that's that's a great like it's very, it's very easy for me to say okay you know what, I can binge the Castlevania anime because there's only well now there's three seasons but there's one season and like six episodes.

02:25:29.740 --> 02:25:42.740
I can do that. But yeah, when you start to get and this happens to me all the time is that like, even a show that I really enjoy like The Good Place and Shane is always saying when are you gonna finish that when are you gonna finish that it's like my backlog

02:25:42.740 --> 02:25:50.740
keeps getting bigger and bigger I just don't know when I'm going to be able to do it but then some other smaller show will sneak in it's like oh yeah I binge it because it was only a couple hours.

02:25:50.740 --> 02:25:54.740
So, it just just kind of depends on what you have room for at the time.

02:25:54.740 --> 02:26:08.740
So, all right, well on that note I think we're going to wrap things up for the night and I will say, thank you for taking the time to work Orange Launch Radio into your week, whether you joined us here live on Sunday night, or you're listening to our podcast at some point

02:26:08.740 --> 02:26:26.740
throughout the week on a platform like iTunes, Spotify, Google Podcasts, wherever it is that you listen to podcasts. Thank you so much for choosing Orange Launch Radio to fill quite a bit of your time, more than the normal podcast this week, but we make no apologies for the length of our show it's the way it's always been.

02:26:26.740 --> 02:26:41.740
So thank you so much for checking us out. If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice but we need the voices to be here to help put them out on air.

02:26:41.740 --> 02:26:50.740
A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this show goes a long way. Auto hosts for VOG Network on Twitch really go a long way.

02:26:50.740 --> 02:27:01.740
Thank you to those you I wish I had a list that still showed me who did that Twitch took that away a while ago so I don't know who's hosting, but I will just say thank you if you are one of the people that does that we really really appreciate it.

02:27:01.740 --> 02:27:13.740
On that note, I think we'll wrap things up, remember programming note we will not be here next week, due to virtual dragon con and the Labor Day holiday. I hope all of you out there in the states have a wonderful Labor Day holiday.

02:27:14.740 --> 02:27:24.740
If you're somewhere else I hope you have a wonderful weekend whatever it is you're doing this weekend. Please be safe. Remember just because you're done with COVID doesn't mean COVID is done with you.

02:27:24.740 --> 02:27:36.740
Please continue to wear your masks, social distance. Let's get through this we have some hopefully promising things that are going to help, such as this rapid test that's all up in the news these past couple days.

02:27:36.740 --> 02:27:45.740
It's not going to fix it but it's going to help and hopefully we'll continue to make progress over the next few months but we've got to wear our masks. We've got a social distance and keep following the rules, so please keep that in mind.

02:27:45.740 --> 02:27:50.740
Speaking of masks. Yeah. Did you see Lady Gaga's horn mask.

02:27:50.740 --> 02:27:57.740
It's beautiful and I want one everyone I didn't have to show me that if you want to make wearing a mask interesting.

02:27:57.740 --> 02:28:00.740
Do stuff to it. Keep it effective.

02:28:00.740 --> 02:28:15.740
But go to town, make everybody think, Oh, gosh, this person is fashionable I want to be like them. I hated the idea of masks at first because I didn't like the idea of Heidi I mean I wore them for scientific reasons only, but I've warmed up to them a lot

02:28:15.740 --> 02:28:23.740
because now I'm like, Oh, you can get masks that are fun and festive. It's kind of like underwear but it's like everybody can see it.

02:28:23.740 --> 02:28:28.740
Underwear that's fun to wear. Yeah, exactly. Except it's like, over where I was.

02:28:28.740 --> 02:28:34.740
I was having a chat with somebody at Oto's the other day is the local Japanese market.

02:28:34.740 --> 02:28:48.740
And we were just talking about how they become like our fashion accessories here. I was like, Well, I mean, and and you know I'd already adapted, not, not like doing this like as a bow I did this earlier before everybody, but I had adopted wearing masks at work

02:28:48.740 --> 02:28:57.740
if I had a cold or I was sick because I get sinus infection so often, but I wouldn't know if it was a sinus infection or if I had a cold or if I had the flu or something.

02:28:57.740 --> 02:29:07.740
So for me, I always had these charcoal masks at my desk that I pick up a die so in a box, so that I was sick, I didn't get somebody else.

02:29:07.740 --> 02:29:19.740
And right when everything started going on right before I got pneumonia. People were like, I heard you have masks, I heard you have masks, I'm like,

02:29:19.740 --> 02:29:23.740
Bobby black, I hate wearing a bra.

02:29:23.740 --> 02:29:32.740
Bobby black open chat says, I look at it kind of like ties, you can have fun ties if you have to wear a suit, I hate wearing a suit so wearing a fun tie makes it tolerable.

02:29:32.740 --> 02:29:40.740
Same way with masks. Yes, I wear my mask I promise. So yeah, it's a little fun little fun to be had. All right, anyway, let's get our final thoughts.

02:29:40.740 --> 02:29:47.740
I just say don't be a mass commando. Yeah, I'm dark soccer final thought tonight.

02:29:47.740 --> 02:29:49.740
Party words for our listeners this week.

02:29:49.740 --> 02:29:55.740
Two weeks old hot dog and it was amazing and also, I ordered you a thing.

02:29:56.740 --> 02:30:07.740
I ordered you a thing yes I did. It's going to take a while to arrive. That's because of where I ordered it from, but I will give you a clue if you want to try to guess what it is.

02:30:07.740 --> 02:30:10.740
Okay.

02:30:10.740 --> 02:30:18.740
Um, I could go for the obvious and tell you that it is okay.

02:30:18.740 --> 02:30:20.740
She's your favorite.

02:30:20.740 --> 02:30:22.740

02:30:22.740 --> 02:30:24.740
No.

02:30:24.740 --> 02:30:31.740
One of my favorites, one of my favorites, maybe it's just you brought up Gaga earlier maybe it's Gaga.

02:30:31.740 --> 02:30:34.740
All right, not a living person.

02:30:34.740 --> 02:30:36.740
Okay, interesting.

02:30:36.740 --> 02:30:40.740
Okay. All right. All right. We'll see. We'll see. All right.

02:30:40.740 --> 02:30:53.740
All right. Okay. Um, so that's, that's that we're all wrapped up for the night. My final thought would be, I kind of I guess I already kind of said it the whole thing I just said a minute ago is stay safe with with COVID and all that I don't need to

02:30:53.740 --> 02:31:09.740
