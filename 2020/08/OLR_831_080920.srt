1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,380
There have been various attempts at PC Bumani before, Konami Hawaii's DDRPC in the early

2
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,280
2000s, and the more recent DDRV in your browser.

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,940
But on the heels of successful launches of 2DX, Infinitas, and SoundVoltex Cloud, the

4
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,660
next on the list is GITADORA.

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,060
Now I'm waiting to hear about three conga drums becoming available.

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,660
I may be slightly facetious about that, but that isn't something you'll have to constantly

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,540
put up with from your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki, as they bring you

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,620
the rest of tonight's news, right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:47,140
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

10
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,140
every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:56,060
We are back once again tonight with Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 831, for this

12
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,780
August 9th of 2020.

13
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,980
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined via Discord, because we're still doing the whole

14
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,640
social distancing thing, with my co-hosts here to talk about video games and gaming

15
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,580
news and all that, starting off with DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

16
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,580
Hello.

17
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,620
Hi, how are you?

18
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,620
I'm okay.

19
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,620
Good.

20
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,620
It's good to see you.

21
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,340
I can actually see you, thanks to the magic of Discord and the television that's over

22
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,220
on the side here, because we do tape- I didn't do anything fancy.

23
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,220
No wigs tonight.

24
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,220
That's okay.

25
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,220
That's okay.

26
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,660
I don't have any makeup.

27
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,660
I'm just me.

28
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,660
You're just a natural tonight.

29
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,660
Normal girl.

30
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,660
Which is all good.

31
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,660
Normal girl.

32
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,660
Normal girl.

33
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,700
Because we do tape live, if you want to see the video, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock

34
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,460
Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, over at the Voice of

35
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,500
Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network.

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,780
And for those of you that do tune in on Twitch, you might notice there's a few things that

37
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,460
have changed around a little bit.

38
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,800
Number one, I don't have hair anymore, or a hat.

39
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,240
I had my Britney Spears 2006 moment this week, and I just shaved my head.

40
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,240
I was like, you know what?

41
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,240
Why not?

42
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,320
Quarantine's the time to do it.

43
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,360
So I did it.

44
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,680
And so I thought I'd show it off tonight, because some folks were saying, I don't know,

45
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
I'm still getting used to it.

46
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,680
I don't know if I love it.

47
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,200
But some folks on Instagram were like, no, it's a good look.

48
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,200
It's good.

49
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,200
So I'm like, all right, whatever.

50
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
We'll try it.

51
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,200
So here I am.

52
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,600
And I have this mic stand here.

53
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,200
So I don't know what to do with my hands.

54
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,920
For the first time in 18 years, I don't know what to do with my hands, because I'm not

55
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,880
holding a microphone.

56
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,000
Instead, I have this mic stand.

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,880
And this mic stand was donated by DJ Rama S, our pal over at Anime Jam Session, which

58
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,160
is Tuesday nights here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

59
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,160
A big, big thank you to Rama.

60
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,220
I've kind of resisted the mic stand thing for a long time, just because, well, the way

61
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,360
we've always done it is with the handheld mics, and it works fine.

62
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,460
But you know what?

63
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,780
I need to learn to embrace change a little more.

64
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,660
Because maybe I would have got on the Twitch train sooner if I'd done that, or what have

65
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,660
you.

66
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,420
So if the listeners are like, get a mic stand, then fine.

67
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,420
I will try.

68
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,660
I will try the mic stand.

69
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,100
But I don't know what to do with my hands.

70
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,540
So I might just kind of like have them in the little scared all night or something.

71
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,540
I don't know.

72
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,220
I don't know what to do.

73
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,660
Any suggestions what I should do with my hands, DarkSakura?

74
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,660
Para-para.

75
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,660
Oh, I could.

76
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,100
Maybe if we could play some music, we could do that.

77
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,100
All right.

78
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,980
Let me turn to Tech Master Loki to see if there's any suggestions on what to do with

79
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,980
the hands.

80
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,980
Hi, Loki.

81
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,660
Just do nothing.

82
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,780
I don't know.

83
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,740
Just keep them out of frame.

84
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,740
All right.

85
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,740
Yes.

86
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,740
I will put them down by my sides.

87
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,740
Sit on them.

88
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,740
Okay.

89
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,740
Sit on my hands.

90
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,740
That's fine.

91
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,740
There you go.

92
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,740
Yeah.

93
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:47,860
DJ Rama S. in our chat room says, your hands are free to hold two adult beverages.

94
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,860
Yeah.

95
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,700
That is true.

96
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,500
And then I also switched out the microphone to a different one.

97
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,940
So hopefully all the sound is still good and all that.

98
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,500
But I think this will work out fine.

99
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,380
I'm into it.

100
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,980
No one special in our chat says, got to say it.

101
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,980
Leave Rob alone.

102
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,980
Well, you know what?

103
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,660
Here's the reality.

104
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:12,540
I'm 42 years old and God was already making me bald.

105
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,900
And I'm very against using like products and stuff that kind of prey on those insecurities

106
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,780
because if this is the way our maker made us, then whatever, right?

107
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,500
But I just decided, you know what?

108
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,660
Let's just try this, even though I kind of liked having what little hair I did.

109
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,660
I don't know.

110
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,020
The bald thing's growing on me.

111
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,100
It'll be all right.

112
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,580
And some folks in chat are making Hitman jokes.

113
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,580
So sure.

114
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,580
I could do that as a cosplay.

115
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,900
Next Dragon Con.

116
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,900
I'll dress up as Hitman.

117
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,900
I don't know.

118
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,900
All right.

119
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,900
Let's see.

120
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,900
Other comments in chat.

121
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,420
SSJ100Matt says, waiting for someone to suggest for him to hold Smush.

122
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:51,460
Well, if Smush will come in here and sit in the basket, I'll be happy to, but he's been

123
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,020
kind of keeping to himself.

124
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:58,220
Mr. Smush, instead of sitting in the basket, he has a new box lid in the hallway and that

125
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,500
is his favorite thing in the world.

126
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,700
It's his new little bed.

127
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,640
He's slept in it all week long.

128
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,300
He loves the box lid.

129
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,700
And the greatest thing about the box lid is it actually says on the side of it, delicious.

130
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,540
So when he's laying on the bed, it looks like he's, all right, forget it.

131
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,200
SSJ100Matt says you can still cosplay as Sami Zayn.

132
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,540
He also has a shaved head now.

133
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,540
Oh, that's good.

134
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,600
I still have the WrestleMania shirt and all that stuff that I wore at that one Dragon

135
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Con.

136
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
So there was that.

137
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,980
So, all right.

138
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,020
Anyhow, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight because believe it or not, we do talk about

139
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,220
video games once in a while here on this show.

140
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,480
Let's talk about what happened at the State of Play this week.

141
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:41,560
So Sony did like a little direct of sorts, if you want to kind of copy Nintendo Direct

142
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,440
style, which is everybody's doing these days.

143
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,640
PlayStation did their own direct, but they were very clear in advance.

144
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,600
No PlayStation 5 info.

145
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
This is...

146
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,280
Which means people were immediately disappointed because no one reads those or they expect

147
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,920
surprises just like that last Nintendo Direct where they said, listen, it's only going to

148
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,600
focus on third party titles.

149
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,280
Like why you didn't announce a new Metroid or F-Zero?

150
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
What the heck?

151
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,880
Did we or did we not get Godfall though?

152
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,760
So there was a PlayStation 5 thing that snuck in there, wasn't there?

153
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah, but Godfall has been like, they've shown Godfall like several times and it's kind of

154
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,180
boring looking.

155
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,180
I don't...

156
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,220
Am I the only one that doesn't hate Godfall?

157
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,480
Like what I've seen of it?

158
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
Like I get...

159
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,200
They don't hate it, I'm just indifferent.

160
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Yeah, I get where people are like, this is kind of like, I look like I've seen this before.

161
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,740
What's so PlayStation 5 about this?

162
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,740
But I don't know.

163
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,520
It looks like a game I might try.

164
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,360
I don't hate it the way the rest of the internet does, but that's, that's how I often feel

165
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
about video games these days.

166
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,920
I don't hate it, but it doesn't look interesting to me.

167
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
I don't know.

168
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,920
All right.

169
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
Fair enough.

170
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
Well, what else?

171
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
This looks very generic.

172
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,360
Um, so they had a few other trailers, so there's one that I've actually seen quite a few times

173
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,720
with The Pedestrian, which is kind of a platformer game that takes place in Street Science.

174
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,640
That's kind of neat.

175
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,080
There is a new expansion for Control.

176
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,040
Uh, the, is it AWE or AWE, I guess, which is coming out at the end of this month.

177
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,560
The Alan Wake expansion.

178
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,560
Eh, whatever.

179
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,560
Okay.

180
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,840
So the Alan Wake expansion, yeah, that's going to be coming out at the end of the month.

181
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,000
If you're a Remedy fan, that's a pretty big deal.

182
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,920
Like Alan Wake was a game a lot of people slept on unnecessarily and it was really good.

183
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,840
Um, and to be fair, I'm sleeping on Control still.

184
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,360
I just haven't gotten around to playing it, but I really need to.

185
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,600
Like Remedy always has put out, uh, quality products.

186
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,680
Game Break, a lot of people slept on too, and that was a really good game.

187
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,280
So I, I don't, yeah, I don't know what's happening, why people keep, uh, uh, sleeping on the Remedy

188
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,700
stuff, but I want to check out Control for sure.

189
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,400
We got some gameplay footage of Bugsnax, which was interesting.

190
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,360
Yeah, it's like, it's like a first person ape escape, right?

191
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,440
Sort of, yeah.

192
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,680
And then, uh, they announced that Star Wars Vader Immortal is coming to, uh, PlayStation

193
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,420
VR, which makes sense, I guess.

194
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:02,580
I think that came out originally on the Quest, so it's, you know, it's cool that it's coming

195
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,580
to other platforms.

196
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:09,620
Uh, Spelunky 2's got a date on the PlayStation 15th, and on the September 15th, it's coming

197
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,740
out on PlayStation 4.

198
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,380
That was a pleasant surprise.

199
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,580
I was really happy to hear that Spelunky 2 is a thing.

200
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,380
I mean, of course it's a thing, but I feel like, you know, Spelunky's been out, God,

201
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,800
that game's been out at least five years.

202
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,340
That goes back probably longer.

203
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:27,140
It goes back to the early days of the PlayStation 4, and I really feel like that game, like,

204
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:31,100
kind of like a lot of stuff came after it that really invokes Spelunky.

205
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,500
I don't know if that's just the roguelike thing, you know, like every roguelike feels

206
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,900
like it has some similarities, but I feel like Spelunky really kind of paved the way

207
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,020
of sorts, so it's nice to see it getting, like, an official sequel.

208
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,940
And talking about, like, old games coming, old indie games coming back, but apparently

209
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,620
there's an anniversary edition of Braid being made for the PlayStation 5.

210
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,660
I believe, actually, it's also coming out on other platforms as well, but that's coming

211
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:01,660
out early 2021, so yeah, they're going to release that on pretty much all the platforms.

212
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:07,780
I like how it's just Braid Anniversary Edition, because if I am doing my math right, that

213
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:15,540
game originally came out in 2008, I believe, so that game is 12 years old, so it's not

214
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:22,380
really the 10th anniversary or the 15th anniversary, it's just an anniversary.

215
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,780
Right.

216
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:30,220
And then they announced, along with Hitman 3, there's going to be a VR portion of that

217
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,060
as well, so it's going to have a VR mode, which apparently allows you to play missions

218
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,820
from the entire trilogy, so that's kind of cool.

219
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,060
Crash Bandicoot 4, they showed some more gameplay with that, and talk a little bit about that

220
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:48,820
as well, and it's a direct sequel to Crash Bandicoot Warped, and it looked kind of cool.

221
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,820
What else?

222
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:55,780
The pathless being shown, so they kind of did a little bit of a gameplay walkthrough

223
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,780
of that.

224
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:09,020
Let's see, a game called Genshi Impact, and Anno, I don't even know, Mutationim, I guess,

225
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:13,780
that's going to be coming out on PlayStation 4 at the end of the year there.

226
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:22,100
And Pele Hanomeo says DLC for Outer Worlds due out this month, but didn't the Xbox series

227
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,620
have that, or maybe they probably didn't date it in the Xbox announcement, but I feel like

228
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,620
it was...

229
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:32,100
Oh, the Outer Worlds, yeah, I don't think they dated it, no, I don't think it said when

230
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,100
it was.

231
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,100
So now they dated it.

232
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,100
Got it.

233
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,540
And then I know this one was something I saw on PC at one point, but apparently Temtem,

234
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:45,540
which is kind of a Pokemon clone, is coming to PlayStation 5 next year as well.

235
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,660
That's subtly kind of a big deal, I think.

236
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,860
I know that's a weird way to phrase it, but I think the fact that Temtem has gotten big

237
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,860
enough that it's justifying a PlayStation release to really kind of take on...

238
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,660
I don't want to say take on, but really respond to maybe one of Nintendo's biggest franchises.

239
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,780
I think that's kind of a big deal.

240
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,220
Yeah, and then they showed God of Fall, and then of course there was another announcement,

241
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:18,420
Hood Outlaw and Legends, which is a medieval PlayStation 5 game coming out next year.

242
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,120
And Auto Chess, apparently there was a trailer for that as well.

243
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:27,740
So Act F is in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network and is clarifying that the

244
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,420
Temtem release on PlayStation 5 was a Kickstarter goal.

245
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,420
I didn't...

246
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,900
Thank you for clarifying, because I didn't follow that Kickstarter, so I didn't know

247
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,900
that they'd already promised their releases on console.

248
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:40,340
I still find it interesting, you know, for something that's essentially a Pokemon clone,

249
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:46,580
to which Act F says it is a Pokemon clone, but it has fallen off, quite off the radar.

250
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,580
I thought it...

251
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,540
Didn't it have some like weird bumps in the road when it came out on PC?

252
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:55,420
Like I don't want to make stuff up, but I feel like it had like a rough kind of launch

253
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,420
week.

254
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,140
I'm not sure.

255
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:05,320
Act F clarifies it's early access, so well then problems are to be expected, I suppose.

256
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,120
And then one other confirmation that came out of that as well is that, talking about

257
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,720
backwards compatibility with some of the peripherals.

258
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,200
So they said that basically Arcade 6 and other specialty peripherals will work with PlayStation

259
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:24,840
5 titles, but DualShock 4, those controllers are only going to be compatible with PlayStation

260
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,840
4 games.

261
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,460
So it's kind of disappointing.

262
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:32,280
I'm surprised though that that's going to be the case, you know, considering that there

263
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:39,600
was that extra two back button add-on that they had for the PlayStation 4 DualShocks.

264
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,480
I'm wondering if maybe that's going to add some sort of compatibility with PlayStation

265
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,280
5 games as well, or maybe not, I don't know.

266
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,600
It's hard to say, but has PlayStation ever done the upwards compatibility?

267
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,600
Like the three controllers don't work on a four and twos don't work on a three, so I'm

268
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,600
not...

269
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,480
Yes, they did on the PlayStation 1 controllers, those DualShocks worked on the PlayStation

270
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,480
2.

271
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,480
Okay.

272
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:11,240
The only downside for that is it may not work necessarily perfectly because the PlayStation

273
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:18,040
2 face buttons were analog versus digital buttons that were on the PlayStation 1 DualShock

274
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,040
controller.

275
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,320
So for example, I think like Gran Turismo and some of those games actually responded

276
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,880
to how hard you push on the buttons on those.

277
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,120
So that was really the only difference, but I don't think there's that many games that

278
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,120
use that.

279
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,160
And honestly, I used to use my PlayStation 1 DualShock controllers all the time with

280
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,460
PlayStation 2 games and never knows from.

281
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:43,720
So yeah, that was probably the only time that they had like forward compatibility.

282
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,840
And I guess if you count the PlayStation Move controllers, because they just haven't come

283
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,360
up with something better yet, but that's about the only thing.

284
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,120
Fifth Dream in chat says, consoles come with controllers.

285
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,120
This is fake outrage.

286
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,680
I don't know if I'd go so far as say fake outrage.

287
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,320
I would put it in the category of awe bummer, like, oh, bummer, but it's not a deal breaker

288
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,320
for me because you're right.

289
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,360
I'm going to get a controller with the system anyway.

290
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:14,520
And it's still a point of contention because you look at like the Xbox One and the Xbox

291
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,440
Series X, the Xbox Series X is backwards compatible with the Xbox One controllers.

292
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,400
You can use those on that system.

293
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:26,120
So that is something like I know for if you're just playing single player, that's probably

294
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,320
not a big deal because yes, it does come with a controller.

295
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,100
But like, if you're like me, I bought controllers for my entire family.

296
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,680
So that's four controllers I have to replace, assuming I was going to do that probably wouldn't.

297
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,560
But you know, let's say that was, you know, that is an additional expense that I need

298
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,560
to spend money on.

299
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:49,120
Because if I want to replace that, have that same type of gameplay, then I need to buy

300
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,560
additional controllers, which, you know, hopefully aren't going to be too expensive.

301
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,880
But it's still something like that you're gonna have additional controllers lying around

302
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
as well.

303
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,640
It would be nice if they work with it.

304
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
Yeah.

305
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,640
But whatever.

306
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,720
That's yeah, that's where my head is that is like, oh, it's nice when it happens that

307
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,720
way.

308
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,760
But it didn't, you know, oh, well, usually they don't like it's more often than not,

309
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,400
they don't work upwards.

310
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
So right.

311
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,240
And it can make sense to because I, you know, when you look at the Xbox games, you know,

312
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,320
the Series X, a lot of most of those games are going to launch, you know, on both the

313
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,560
Xbox One and on the Xbox Series X.

314
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,780
So they have to have that compatibility between the two because they're going to be on both

315
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,320
of those platforms at the same time.

316
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,600
Whereas Sony doesn't have that.

317
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,620
And there's additional functionality in those controllers that they can't necessarily do

318
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,040
without it, we kind of break those games if it didn't have it in there.

319
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,500
So I understand it, it's just kind of kind of sucks.

320
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,780
But it's not like it's a bummer bummer.

321
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,780
That's it.

322
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,540
Yeah, it's kind of like, oh, yeah, wish it wasn't like that.

323
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,500
But I also feel like, you know, it'll be offset.

324
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,900
You know, Sony hasn't revealed all the secrets of the controller in the system and everything

325
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,900
yet.

326
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,540
You know, we know there's this thing that the jump right in the game and the potential

327
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,200
to have like shortcuts and things now obviously doesn't speak to the controller.

328
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,460
But my point is, there are things about this system that are still under lock and key.

329
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,300
And I think the full secrets of that controller is one of them.

330
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,480
So maybe it will make more sense once we know all those secrets.

331
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,140
So I'm that's why I'm kind of like, I'm not like, okay, like, oh, bummer, that would be

332
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:31,000
that would have been cool if it weren't and they do they do work for the backwards compatibility.

333
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,320
So there is that I'm still like, all right, so.

334
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,320
And that's fine.

335
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,740
It works for what it needs to work for.

336
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,820
I kind of feel like I even though I don't know all of what the controller can do, I

337
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,900
kind of feel like it's just going to be basically copying the switch controllers.

338
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,960
I think that's just going to be in hand tactics.

339
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,960
Just like that.

340
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,960
It's like, look, it's so amazing.

341
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
It's so new.

342
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,340
It's like, well, this is exactly what we have on the switch.

343
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,660
You know, it's saying it's, it's unique.

344
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,660
Kind of did that with the move controllers.

345
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,980
Oh, it's a unique thing.

346
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,980
We're not copying the Wiimotes, no, not at all.

347
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,980
Let's see what happens.

348
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,980
There's still going to be more.

349
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,340
I mean, obviously, we know Microsoft has got another event that they're going to have to

350
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,860
do probably in August.

351
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,600
And I imagine Sony's going to need to do the same thing also in August, which is the month

352
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
that we're in right now.

353
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,040
So I imagine maybe sometime around like Labor Day-ish, we'll probably get some dueling announcements.

354
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,840
Something a little bit late breaking here, by the way, it's not on our show roll, but

355
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,160
something I picked up on Twitter, actually, that was posted to our Discord just minutes

356
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,120
before we went live tonight.

357
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:34,760
But apparently a leak has confirmed the existence of an Xbox Series S in addition to the Xbox

358
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,760
Series X.

359
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,820
And what that leak is, apparently a box for one of the controllers came out and it actually

360
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,760
lists the Xbox Series S under it.

361
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,280
Now, you still have to take these sort of things with a grain of salt because we know

362
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,960
people have gone so far as to Photoshop like boxes and things like that before because

363
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,960
people are crazy.

364
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,960
Well, they have an actual controller, though.

365
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,880
And actually, it's like a retail version of the Xbox.

366
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,320
This one definitely seems to hold some water compared to some other things we've seen before.

367
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,680
But again, the Twitter fake a couple weeks ago with the F-Zero thing and all that, that

368
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,680
was a pretty good fake, too.

369
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,040
Well, but that's a more disappointing thing, though, still.

370
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:16,640
Dude, we're in the year 2020, going into 2021, and we're still using two AA batteries for

371
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
the Xbox controllers.

372
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,120
Come on, can we please get some rechargeable batteries, please?

373
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,360
Come on, is it going to be so difficult?

374
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,720
We've had it for two generations already for the PlayStation.

375
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,840
I understand that sometimes those batteries go bad and you have to replace the whole thing,

376
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,080
but come on.

377
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:42,360
I think it should be able to be done already, I guess, to keep the costs down, but I don't

378
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,360
know.

379
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,560
Looking at some comments in chat regarding that Xbox Series S I just talked about, DJ

380
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,920
Rama S says, wasn't that leak confirmed months ago?

381
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,560
And Bobby Blackwell says, well, I thought that was Lockhart.

382
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,320
Yeah, there's been the word.

383
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,400
This is not a huge surprise because, yes, the rumors have been out there that there's

384
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,160
this other thing they're working on, Lockhart, and it's another console that falls into the

385
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:08,000
Xbox Series S or Xbox Series line.

386
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,360
So people are wondering, is S like their discless version of the X?

387
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,960
We don't really know what it all entails, but it does seem to be it's going to be a

388
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,000
cheaper offering and how they're going to get under PlayStation 5.

389
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,020
If I were to guess, it's going to be a redesign of the Xbox One right now, that generation

390
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:33,500
of console put into the form factor of the Xbox One Series X, kind of like how they redid

391
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:38,460
the Xbox 360 at one time to kind of make it a little bit smaller.

392
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:43,700
I could see it something like that because, I don't know, or maybe not.

393
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,940
I'm curious to see what Microsoft presents.

394
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:51,920
I do feel like I will myself will probably get a Series X just because I'm a little more

395
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,620
of a, I guess, hardcore, I don't like to call myself a hardcore gamer because I'm not very

396
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,620
good at games.

397
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,260
I just really enjoy them.

398
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,500
So I'm a core gamer.

399
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:04,060
I'm just a medium core gamer.

400
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:10,260
And I feel like I'll get an Xbox Series X just because it is the more, you know, it's

401
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:16,740
why I get the nicer iPhone and not the, usually they put out like a more affordable model

402
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,800
that's kind of like last year's specs.

403
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,460
And that's cool for the people that want that, but I want the fanciest one.

404
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:29,900
So I'll probably end up going with that for Xbox Series X.

405
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,900
We'll see.

406
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:37,060
I'm curious what they're doing and what their strategy is overall, that's for sure.

407
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:40,800
And how they're kind of responding to the PlayStation 5 because that competition, even

408
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:46,380
though I don't like the fanboy wars, I don't like the whole PlayStation versus Xbox and

409
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,500
the way that people behave on Twitter sometimes, I don't care for that.

410
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,500
But just as a fan of gaming and that competition where they're kind of challenging each other

411
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,900
to do better, that I like.

412
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:02,780
And so I'm curious to see how the Xbox Series X kind of needles Sony, if nothing else.

413
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,300
I'm very curious about that.

414
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:10,220
DJRoma S says, the Xbox Series S is a smaller, less powerful version of the Series X, but

415
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:15,300
more powerful than the Xbox One S. Yeah, that's kind of, again, kind of what we're hearing

416
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,020
is that it's probably going to be a little more like an Xbox One, but something with

417
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:23,300
a little more oomph they can play the games a little better, but probably not a disk drive.

418
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,340
It's probably one thing that we can guarantee won't be in it, but we really don't know shit

419
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,460
until Microsoft has their official unveiling.

420
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,180
But maybe this is going to motivate them to get that done faster.

421
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,180
I don't know.

422
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,180
We'll see.

423
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,180
All right.

424
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,340
Well, is that it for the state of play?

425
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,340
Is that everything?

426
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,340
What'd you think overall?

427
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,780
What'd you think overall?

428
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,480
I skimmed through because I forgot that it was on.

429
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,000
I had like meetings during that time, you know, work stuff.

430
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,460
And so I forgot that it was started.

431
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,340
And so I had to kind of skim through it to catch up to the actual live stream.

432
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,700
So I was all right.

433
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,700
There's just some things like I didn't care to see trailers for, but like, it's fine.

434
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,700
It's not for just me.

435
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,220
There wasn't any like huge surprises.

436
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,460
It was just kind of, it was what it was.

437
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:12,140
I think it worked nice as a bridge between the two PlayStation 5 events, especially when

438
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,460
it comes to PlayStation VR.

439
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,500
Because I don't know if you remember when we were talking about that PlayStation 5 event,

440
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,660
I kind of commented, I was like, you know, for all that talk about how the PlayStation

441
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,740
VR will work with the PlayStation 5, they didn't really show anything when it comes

442
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,420
to PlayStation 5 VR and how it works there.

443
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,620
Still don't know like what exactly, I mean, I don't know if they have new hardware coming

444
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,620
out for that yet.

445
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,220
Probably not this year, I'd imagine.

446
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,220
We don't.

447
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:43,940
But the fact that VR is still being supported well enough to necessitate a Star Wars game,

448
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:47,460
which is a pretty, I mean, then again, Kinect got a Star Wars game too.

449
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:52,500
It's technically a port, it came out on the Oculus Quest, I want to say.

450
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,940
It's still a new release and it still is something to, you know, inject life into the PlayStation

451
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:03,700
VR that says to me, yes, Sony is still pushing this forward, but we'll see what comes of

452
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,060
it on PlayStation 5.

453
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:10,780
Because for all we know right now, the PlayStation 5 VR will be nothing but backwards compatibility.

454
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,900
That's all we know.

455
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,940
But I don't think that really is going to be the case.

456
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,500
I think we will see some 5 stuff.

457
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,540
We don't know it yet.

458
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,540
Yeah.

459
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,700
I don't think, I think what you'll see is you'll see a look, hopefully a bump in the

460
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:27,980
performance of it, maybe even like the visuals, depending if the hardware is, you know, more

461
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,340
powerful, assuming they come out with new hardware.

462
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:35,540
Kind of like it was a minor bump when you have the PlayStation 4 Pro versus the regular

463
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:42,180
PlayStation 4 in VR, you got some, you know, better definition in the graphics and some

464
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,580
frame rates were a little bit better and there's a little bit more detail in there as well.

465
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:50,900
So I'm hoping a little bit of a jump from that and, you know, being able to run those

466
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:55,740
games a little bit better, hopefully see some more immersive games and hopefully with their

467
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:01,140
improved haptics that they have in the DualShock 5, that they will add that to whatever they

468
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,380
come up with that hopefully is way better than the PlayStation Move controllers because

469
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,380
God, they're so old.

470
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,620
Let me read this comment from chat.

471
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:14,140
Fifth Dream over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network says, trying to sell some last minute VR units

472
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,780
before they drop it like a Vita.

473
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:20,060
I don't, I realize, um, everybody, you know, likes to give Sony a hard time with dropping

474
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,120
hardware because they don't have a great track record.

475
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,360
So it's a fair criticism, but I don't see them dropping VR anytime soon.

476
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:31,160
Number one, them reaffirming support for it on the PlayStation 5 is a big deal.

477
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,100
You'll notice they didn't say shit about the Vita and the PlayStation 5.

478
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,580
We don't even know if you can charge a Vita on a PlayStation 5.

479
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:41,140
So you know, but in all seriousness, when it comes to PlayStation VR, one big difference

480
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:45,760
between PlayStation VR and PlayStation Vita is that PlayStation VR and correct me if I'm

481
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,060
wrong and Bobby's in chat, so I'm sure he will say something, but PlayStation VR is

482
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,460
the most successful VR headset.

483
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,460
It is.

484
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,020
They have sold more PlayStation VRs than they sold anything else.

485
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:59,980
Now, granted, when it comes to PC, that market is a little more splintered because you get

486
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,700
the vibe over here, the Oculus over here and so on.

487
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,260
PlayStation VR is a much more of like, kind of like this baseline thing.

488
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:10,320
There is just that headset for Sony and it's a great entry level VR thing.

489
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,920
And Vita was never the number one selling handheld and never got there.

490
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,160
Never even got close.

491
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,400
And I think some of that is Sony's own mistakes, but that's a conversation for another time.

492
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,000
I just don't see them letting go of VR right now because I feel like VR is still successful.

493
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,920
They're still number one in that department.

494
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,920
And I'm looking at chat.

495
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,920
Ah, yes.

496
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
Thank you.

497
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,740
Bobby says they've sold more PSVR units than five Oculus Index combined.

498
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,740
That's what I thought.

499
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:39,240
So that is why I don't see them dropping VR.

500
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,040
Yeah, I think they'll continue with it.

501
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:47,560
I mean, we see more support for like different games and stuff that are coming out.

502
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,240
I'm just curious to find out more about what the PlayStation 5 is going to bring to it

503
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,760
versus, you know, the backwards compatibility.

504
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,760
Yeah.

505
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,760
All right.

506
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,280
Well, let's move on and get into some other topics for tonight's show.

507
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,960
And we'll talk a little more about what Xbox is doing and Nintendo is doing.

508
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,680
But first, let's talk about what we are doing in our gaming weeks and the types of video

509
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,440
games that we have been playing this week in a segment called How Is Your Gaming Week?

510
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,440
DarkSakura, how is your gaming week?

511
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,440
What have you been up to?

512
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,680
I have been it's been a busy week for me.

513
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:24,680
We've had some some healthy stuff and I've had doctor's visits and stuff, but they released

514
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:29,240
new puzzles for patterned on Apple Arcade, which, you know, I love that game.

515
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,600
It's kind of one of my stress reliefs.

516
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:36,200
I'm going back to playing the moon like mahjong too, just because it's, again, something my

517
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,200
list I can do.

518
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,800
I'm still doing Animal Crossing.

519
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,880
I also have let me look up the word swipe.

520
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,440
I know it's like a dumb little game, but this is what it is.

521
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:51,560
And I got interested in playing this from playing Words With Friends, which I need to

522
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,060
get back to.

523
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,400
But it's just a fun little game.

524
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:01,240
And I get annoyed at it because apparently I have a better vocabulary than the game does.

525
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,440
So I like put in a word.

526
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,080
I know that's a word.

527
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,940
The dictionary knows that's a word.

528
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,720
The game doesn't know that's a word.

529
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,720
Stupid game.

530
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,720
I see screenshots all the time of people with words with friends going, what do you mean

531
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,080
that's not a word?

532
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,080
Right.

533
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,240
Well, I do keep when I'm playing Words With Friends, I actually keep the Scrabble dictionary

534
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,480
open to make sure that before I play a word, I'm playing a legit word.

535
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,560
That's a different story.

536
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,680
This one, they are legit words.

537
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,440
I look them up in the dictionary.

538
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,440
Yes.

539
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,160
I spelled queried, right?

540
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,160
Apparently it's.

541
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,160
Yeah.

542
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,160
Anyway.

543
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:41,960
So, um, however, I got to play one of my favorite words, yurt, do you know what a yurt is?

544
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:49,080
Um, it's kind of, um, octagonal, uh, structure, how structure usually portable, but some people

545
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,080
have permanent yurts.

546
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,080
Okay.

547
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,080
I thought it was like a math thing.

548
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,080
Oh, no, no.

549
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,080
Okay.

550
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
Like house.

551
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
Yeah.

552
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Yeah.

553
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,600
I've heard of it.

554
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,600
I used to want to live in a yurt.

555
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,600
So I had a fun time with that one.

556
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:05,600
Um, um, but at any rate, um, I was playing that I'm going to be sitting back down with

557
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,600
the last of us.

558
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:12,800
Um, once, uh, I can get some of the pain in my wrist, uh, settled down, um, Dan was playing

559
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,800
doom.

560
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:19,740
The other day we got doom on a switch and of course playing on the mode that has my

561
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,000
favorite name hurt me plenty.

562
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,840
Um, and it's not a yacht, it's a yurt, SSJ 100, Matt, Y U R T.

563
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,840
Look it up.

564
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,280
Um, also it's a reference to an old, uh, werewolf game.

565
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,280
I used to play tabletop.

566
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,280
Nice.

567
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:41,880
Um, uh, also, um, speaking of other gaming, um, we switched around some games in the house

568
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,600
to now, uh, Indiana Jones is in the house.

569
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,240
I'll be putting pictures up soon.

570
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,220
Twilight zone is in the house.

571
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,540
I don't know why they moved the white bodies in, but they did.

572
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:56,500
Um, and, um, I'm, uh, I don't know.

573
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,980
I want to play ghost of Tsushima, but I've got so much else going on right now that it's

574
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:04,060
kind of fallen on the wayside one game at a time.

575
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,060
Yeah.

576
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:11,620
Well, and on top of that, um, I'm actually getting wheels in motion for, um, uh, a podcast

577
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,300
myself and video stuff with Dan.

578
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,020
So we've got wheels spinning in the background.

579
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,020
More to come.

580
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,020
Yes.

581
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,020
All right.

582
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,020
On that note, we'll move over to Loki.

583
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,020
Loki.

584
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,020
How was your gaming week?

585
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:28,700
Um, so my week I played a little bit more Minecraft, of course, um, did that.

586
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:34,620
I did try to do some game development this week, but it was a big fight between, um,

587
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,860
uh, unity and myself.

588
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:40,800
So that was the majority of it for like three days.

589
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,480
And then, um, also played some Orna.

590
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,220
I did play a few other things.

591
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,840
So, uh, fall guys, I tried a little bit of that.

592
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,820
So I actually did get in on one of the first few days back when the servers weren't complete

593
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,760
garbage and played a few rounds of them.

594
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,760
It's all right.

595
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:02,280
I, I think the controls are kind of a little, it's a little frustrating at times.

596
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:08,600
Um, but I think that's designed that way on purpose, but it's all right.

597
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,400
It's a, it's a, it's a kind of a fun game to play.

598
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,240
Plus it was free PlayStation plus.

599
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,160
Um, I did pick it up on PC as well so I can play with my son who had no interest in playing

600
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,160
with me.

601
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,680
So, oh, there's that.

602
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,040
And then, uh, uh, what else?

603
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,620
Um, oh yeah.

604
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,620
So yeah.

605
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:29,200
Then I also got, uh, just like Bobby, the, uh, Lego Nintendo set and I was putting that

606
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,520
together on the, um, on Twitch.

607
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,760
I saw your Twitch streams pop up on the fog discord.

608
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,760
That was cool.

609
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,760
Yeah.

610
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,760
So, so we did that.

611
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,000
So I actually do have, um, you know, it right in front of me here.

612
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,760
So it's, it's pretty decent size.

613
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,560
As you can see, um, it's got its controller.

614
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,800
And then of course, uh, the game itself, uh, super Mario brothers.

615
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,320
So you have to lift it up higher.

616
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,320
We can't see.

617
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,320
I know.

618
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,320
I'm sorry.

619
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,600
So you have a super Mario brothers right here.

620
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,480
And then of course the game console, your green screen effect is tearing it apart, but

621
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,440
that's, we're an audio podcast anyway.

622
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,440
So yeah.

623
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,440
So that's pretty cool.

624
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,560
I liked, I liked how they have the little cartridge mechanism in it as well, which is

625
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,560
pretty cool.

626
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,160
So you can put it inside there and actually snaps down and everything.

627
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:20,680
Um, I'm hopefully going to be doing the, uh, TV a little bit later this week.

628
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:26,040
I also did pick up the Lego super Mario brother sets, uh, that I couldn't do on stream because

629
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:30,040
as soon as I brought it in the house, my son wanted me to immediately build it.

630
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:35,440
So we built that one and one of the expansion sets, I still have, uh, actually it was two

631
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,040
of the expansion sets that we built and I still have one more to build as well.

632
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,080
And so he is, he's been playing with those.

633
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:47,480
Um, but yeah, it was a pretty cool little toy, so, um, and I really enjoyed the set.

634
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,320
Bobby extensively went into the Lego stuff on his show tonight and he said that that

635
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:56,080
TV took like six hours to build and, you know, looking at it, it does look like it's a very

636
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,320
like meticulous process.

637
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,160
You kind of have to do pixel by pixel, so to speak.

638
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,400
Um, but the whole thing, he was showing off the whole finished set up, set up and everything.

639
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,840
It does look, it looks really nice.

640
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,700
Like, you know, the fact that it doesn't use like rubber bands and the complicated shit

641
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:14,300
that Lego has done before, um, like that it's all very, it's just neat.

642
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,300
It's all really cool.

643
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,300
How it's all put together.

644
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,300
Yeah.

645
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,300
I could probably speed run that.

646
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:22,620
So he says the NES took him six hours, took me four to put it together.

647
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:26,700
Um, and then, uh, the TV, I don't know, we'll see.

648
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:32,020
I just, I try to organize myself and just, just knock it out.

649
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,020
So we'll see.

650
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,100
I don't know, but you got to enjoy it.

651
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,620
So, you know, definitely want to take your time.

652
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,620
All right.

653
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,220
You got that for your gaming week?

654
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,220
That is all right.

655
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,220
Then my gaming week.

656
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:45,580
Um, so a game I didn't play, but I thought about playing cause I have to respond to this

657
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:50,720
in chat is no man's sky because I was watching Delvin, uh, VG realness in our chat.

658
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,340
Make sure you're following him on Twitch too.

659
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:56,040
Uh, he was streaming no man's sky and playing it for the first time and kind of watching

660
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,880
him go through it in the beginning.

661
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,880
I did.

662
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,080
I kind of forget that that game really does throw you in and you always start, and this

663
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,380
is, if you didn't know this about no man's sky, you always start on a planet where the

664
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,960
atmosphere is kind of hurting you.

665
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,760
Like you have a limited amount of life that's ticking down.

666
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,660
So you have to be able to move like quick enough to figure out like, Oh, I get my sodium

667
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,000
here to refill this and so on and so on.

668
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,260
So it's, it's, it's not the most kind thing.

669
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:27,100
Now there are other planets you will find, and if you haven't figured this out yet, Delvin,

670
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:31,340
where the atmosphere is a lot more forgiving and you can walk around for a lot longer without

671
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,340
needing that stuff.

672
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,300
Um, but I always forgot like, damn, that game really does like throw you in and it can be

673
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,300
kind of stressful.

674
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,640
But I still think that game is so good and so rewarding and I really need to check out

675
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,060
some of the changes.

676
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:46,220
And I thought it was really good, uh, cause quest buster was posting some stuff to our

677
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:50,300
discord, uh, which haven't, if you haven't joined our discord yet, check it out, vog

678
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:56,060
network.com that's vognetwork.com slash discord, uh, and folks chat throughout the week about,

679
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,060
you know, things they heard on the show and stuff.

680
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:02,460
And one of the things that quest buster was posting about was, Hey, I went and found when

681
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:07,460
you and Bobby Blackwell for both streaming this game, you built, uh, like houses on voglandia

682
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,060
and I found them here they are and here's what they look like right now.

683
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,060
And I thought that was really cool.

684
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:16,100
Uh, so it was neat that, uh, quest buster has been, um, going to that too.

685
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:20,660
And yeah, vg realness points out no man's sky is on game pass for PC and Xbox.

686
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:25,500
Um, so if you are a game pass person, it's, it's high time to check that out.

687
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,500
It's pretty cool.

688
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,780
So yeah, shout out to no man's sky.

689
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:32,420
I, I probably will visit it this week, especially because final fantasy 14 is going to be down

690
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,780
all day tomorrow for the big patch maintenance.

691
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,900
And then after that, I will probably be playing nothing but final fantasy 14.

692
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,540
So I need to probably do no man's sky tomorrow.

693
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,540
We'll see.

694
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,780
So that's pretty cool.

695
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:47,220
Um, we'll see other things that I've actually played this week.

696
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,860
So I played a game called undermine.

697
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:53,580
Speaking of game pass, uh, that game just recently came to game pass on, I know on Xbox

698
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,580
one, pretty sure it's on PC as well.

699
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,580
Undermine is a rogue.

700
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:03,740
Like it kind of reminds me of rogue legacy, um, but mixed with like the Zelda look like

701
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,540
the, uh, the two five D Zelda look, cause it's more like one of those like top down

702
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,760
and you're kind of in the dungeon going around the room.

703
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,600
So, um, that's a pretty good combination of games, right?

704
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,040
If you like rogue likes and you like Zelda, I think that'll be up your alley, which is

705
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,380
funny because I also think you have binding at Isaac, but binding of Isaac was a little

706
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,500
more, if I remember right, like a shooter kind of like there was a lot more like shooty

707
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,980
type of mechanics and different things.

708
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:28,760
I feel like undermine plays a little more like a traditional, traditional Zelda game,

709
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,660
but you're wielding like a pickax instead of a sword, but still it, it, it makes sense.

710
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,420
Um, so I I've been enjoying it, especially because it's a game pass title.

711
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,580
So technically it's like free for me as a subscriber.

712
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,500
So I thought that was kind of neat.

713
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,320
Uh, one of the other games, uh, I've been playing this week.

714
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:50,320
I checked out fall guys, uh, because that came out on PlayStation and this game of course

715
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,900
is doing very well on Twitch.

716
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,740
Lots of people are streaming this game.

717
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:58,820
This game seems to be getting more and more, um, kind of like references and pop culture

718
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,820
and so forth.

719
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,860
Um, I think this game is going to stand to do very well.

720
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:10,620
Um, I think this game is going to follow a very similar trajectory to rocket league.

721
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:16,540
I think it was very smart of the developers to put it out on PlayStation plus for free

722
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:20,460
and I'm using my Cody fingers cause obviously PlayStation plus isn't free, but you know

723
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,460
what I mean?

724
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:25,940
They have all these people already playing it and then now these matches are seated,

725
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:31,540
these 60 person matches and it's great because it's a battle royale kind of game, right?

726
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,980
But it's not a shooty shooty bang bang game.

727
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,620
So like I'm not great at Fortnite because I'm not really good at shooty shooty bang

728
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:45,100
bang since the Duke Nukem and Quake days, but this is more of a, uh, hell style platformer.

729
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,420
Uh, and I think it's a lot of fun.

730
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:52,860
I do agree with what you were saying, Loki, that the controllers feel very rubbery.

731
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:56,060
I think that's obviously it's the aesthetic of the game.

732
00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:00,420
It's supposed to be rubbery and frustrating character tripping over like every once in

733
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,420
a while.

734
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,420
Like when I was just jumping and it's like, okay, come on.

735
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,420
Like I get it.

736
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:08,460
Like if I hit something then trip, but like just jumping, I'm going to fall over.

737
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,900
I guess the game's fall guys.

738
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,220
So I mean it makes sense, but it's kind of frustrating.

739
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,300
Bobby's also pointing out in chat over Twitch TV slash vog network.

740
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,980
They also did the Twitch marketing thing where they spent all their marketing energy

741
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,300
on Twitch streamers, big and small.

742
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,060
They didn't do the traditional marketing route.

743
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,300
So some people were like, man, everyone's talking about fall guys that released today

744
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,020
out of nowhere and I don't get it.

745
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,980
And I'm like, that's the only thing that anyone's been playing on Twitch for a week.

746
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,980
Yeah.

747
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:36,180
And it's a great combination because, Oh, it's free on PlayStation plus.

748
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,460
Well, I'm gonna go get that right now.

749
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,780
And I think it's going to get a huge install base.

750
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:45,420
And I think the next destination for this game has to be the Nintendo switch.

751
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,620
I think we have a story coming up later about, you know, are they going to be looking at

752
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,820
other platforms?

753
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,620
I don't see how they're not.

754
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:55,500
And I do think if this game connects with the Nintendo switch with their, which there's

755
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,420
no reason why it shouldn't, I think it's really going to take off at that point.

756
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,420
Yeah.

757
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:04,940
Um, so Xbox is a little more like, obviously it's just an X, you know, the Xbox and PlayStation

758
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,300
have more in common than they do different.

759
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,540
So I don't think the Xbox is as necessary.

760
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:13,060
I think it will show up there just like rocket league did.

761
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:17,420
But I think the switch is that key component where now you're going to have a lot of these

762
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:21,740
households that only have a switch or there's that portability of the switch.

763
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,580
And I think it's going to do very, very well.

764
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:27,060
I hope they consider releasing it really low cost on the switch.

765
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,780
Um, I know they can't do it free.

766
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,780
I know it's $20 on steam.

767
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:34,980
I think if they can get it even lower, release it for like $10 the first week it's out or

768
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,740
something, it'll do very, very well on switch.

769
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,100
And I think this game is going to stand to do very well.

770
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:44,980
So again, it's, and if you haven't played the game, it's, it's like you go through these

771
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:52,320
levels that remind you of like either American Ninja Warrior or Wipeout or Takeshi's Castle,

772
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,320
you know, take your pick.

773
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:59,140
It's one of these types of shows, but 60 people are running it at once and only the top 43

774
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,780
or something like that get to move on to the next round.

775
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,180
It's very much Takeshi's Castle.

776
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,740
That's exactly the format they use.

777
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,740
Yeah.

778
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,740
Yeah.

779
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,220
The top 30 and then the top.

780
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:13,580
So it's like less and less people get to move on until there's only one winner.

781
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:18,780
And I think part of the reason they can get, get away with giving this game away for free,

782
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:22,380
they don't even need to be charging for it, is that of course there's a shop where you

783
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,780
can buy cosmetics or you can buy the coins.

784
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:29,000
You can either earn the coin slowly through playing the game or if you have to have that

785
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,380
costume right now, cause it's a special, you can pay real money to have that stuff.

786
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,720
It's and again, I think Rocket League is following a very similar trajectory with what it's doing

787
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,120
with its cosmetic store.

788
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:43,360
So I know I, I know I keep comparing it to Rocket League when really those two games

789
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,520
don't have a lot in common.

790
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:51,400
Well, it does have something very, it does have something very important in common with

791
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,680
Rocket League actually.

792
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,440
It's very easy to understand how to play, very easy to understand the rules.

793
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,320
You don't really have to explain it to somebody.

794
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,920
It is like you can watch somebody else play the game, hence why it's doing so well on

795
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,520
Twitch and you understand what's going on right away.

796
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,980
And I think that is something it has in common with Rocket League.

797
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,560
Cause Rocket League is like, oh, it's soccer with cars.

798
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,560
Got it.

799
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,800
You know, oh, Fall Guys.

800
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,460
It's a, it's a wacky, zany level that's going to knock you and send you flying that looks

801
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:26,240
like one of those stupid games Ellen would play on her show, you know, or something like

802
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,240
that.

803
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,760
And it's that, you know, but survivor style.

804
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,160
So it's, it's, it's interesting.

805
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:36,860
I mean, I think, again, I think the game is going to do very well and it, it, it's a,

806
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:41,620
it's sometimes those really simple ideas that do great.

807
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,940
And I applaud them for getting to it first, essentially.

808
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,660
How do we do a battle royale game, but a silly platformer?

809
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,660
There you go.

810
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,660
They did it.

811
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:56,720
So, um, orange right in chat says it's like Takeshi's castle or MXC most extreme challenge

812
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,100
sold me on the game already.

813
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,100
It really is.

814
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:03,460
Uh, pixel pocket says, oh, I know I bomb out on level one about 80% of the time.

815
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,460
LOL.

816
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,460
Yeah.

817
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,580
I haven't gotten past the third stage yet.

818
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:11,020
I have yet to get past the third stage, but I'm not super familiar with all the games

819
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,020
yet.

820
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:16,100
And there's the one I fucking hate is that seesaw level.

821
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:20,420
There's a level where you're just running across seesaws, but remember there's 60 people

822
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,420
doing it.

823
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,660
So if there's too many people on one side, it starts to tilt that way and all those people

824
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,740
fall off.

825
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:31,100
So it's, it's, it's really funny when it's not you doing it.

826
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:38,300
I got to the last round in one of the games, like I got knocked around like somehow like

827
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:42,700
I've also had a two where like at the very end of the first stage or whatever, that somebody

828
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,300
is waiting there, they're not crossing the finish line and they're like holding onto

829
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,300
you trying to like prevent you from crossing the finish line.

830
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,520
So I don't know what that's all about.

831
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:57,140
I guess people are trolling people that way, but, um, yeah, it's, it's interesting.

832
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,860
Uh, quest buster in chat says, and you don't need to totally dedicate hours and hours of

833
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:01,940
time to it too.

834
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:05,780
I feel like I can play a few rounds for a few minutes and not feel obligated to grind

835
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,780
forever.

836
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,900
That's very true as well.

837
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,480
Like it really only takes a few minutes to play a match.

838
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,940
Like you're not going to be dedicating a huge amount of time to the game.

839
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,540
And I think that is an asset.

840
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,540
Absolutely.

841
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:19,100
And I think also should be very appealing for the Nintendo switch.

842
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:24,580
So long story short, this game needs to make its way to Nintendo switch ASAP.

843
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,580
That's for sure.

844
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:30,620
Um, otherwise also been playing a bit of Ingress and Pokemon go and all the location based

845
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,620
GPS games.

846
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,620
As I usually do.

847
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:35,060
I was out walking yesterday for a very long time.

848
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:39,520
I walked eight miles yesterday and that was all doing Ingress missions while I was playing

849
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,020
Pokemon go with Bluetooth.

850
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:46,820
Um, but I caught like nine shiny Magikarp, which, you know, whatever I was more excited

851
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:50,100
because unknown are in raids right now, which is very rare.

852
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,700
They don't usually have the unknown in raids.

853
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:56,940
Um, but they had two letters, U and T and I didn't have yet.

854
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,940
I had L RNA.

855
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:58,940
It's the spells ultra.

856
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:05,220
So I had L from trading from Shane who had Celebi and uh, I got dragon con a couple

857
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,220
of years ago.

858
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:09,740
So the only two letters that were new to me were U and T and I got them both, uh, on my

859
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,740
walking adventure.

860
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:16,300
And those are the only two missing the C. Uh, no, it's, it's just ultra.

861
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,300
Wob.

862
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,300
Rob.

863
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,300
Oh, I get it.

864
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,300
I get it.

865
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,300
Okay.

866
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,940
Anyway, but yes, uh, I got the letters I needed.

867
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:23,940
So that's, that's good.

868
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:28,540
I don't know how many unique unknown letters that gives me now, but it's at least 10, probably

869
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,540
more.

870
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,540
I need to count them all.

871
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,540
So yeah, that's, uh, that's been my game a week.

872
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,540
All right.

873
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:38,260
We're going to get into some other news tonight and starting off with another, uh, a follow

874
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:39,820
up to the PlayStation stuff.

875
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,820
Right?

876
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,820
Logie.

877
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:42,820
Yes.

878
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:48,060
So one of the cooler looking games that they showed off during the PlayStation, um, state

879
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:52,140
of play is this game called and must die.

880
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:55,060
And unfortunately there are some drama behind it though.

881
00:43:55,060 --> 00:44:01,980
So after the whole state of play event in the show, this trailer off, there was a post

882
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:06,500
on Twitter talking about how this game was stolen.

883
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:13,620
Um, so basically what happened was the, um, studio limestone games who was behind this

884
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:18,900
eight members of that creative team, they had resigned from limestone games in June,

885
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:25,060
um, based on, uh, I guess on hot or hostile working conditions.

886
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:31,260
They had posts a whole, um, set of testimonies in Dropbox kind of documenting the different

887
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,460
things that they ran on or ran into.

888
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:38,940
Um, but apparently it's, you know, poor working conditions in the studio behavior of its chief

889
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,940
executive.

890
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:47,260
And um, they basically said this trailer was created with abuse, manipulation and theft

891
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:53,020
and people who have worked on every shot of this are no longer in the company, um, holding

892
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,820
IP rights.

893
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,620
Some were not even paid for their work.

894
00:44:56,620 --> 00:45:02,420
The real IP for the game was stolen from the creators BFL play.

895
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:07,900
And then, um, some of the stuff that they talked about in there as well, that, you know,

896
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:15,180
there was very little support, um, from the CEO and they were hiring additional developers,

897
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:17,820
um, to work on the project.

898
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:25,140
And of course it led to severe workload issues and long crunch and all that type of stuff.

899
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:30,300
So it is unfortunate that there's all this kind of stuff, marring this down.

900
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:34,700
And then of course, focus home interactive, which is the publisher of this doesn't really

901
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:38,660
seem to be involved or they're saying that they're not involved with this, but they're

902
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:41,780
looking into allegations regarding this.

903
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,020
Um, so it's interesting.

904
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:48,580
It's kind of sucks to see this marred by this and considering that a lot of development

905
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:52,500
talent that was behind the game is no longer at the company.

906
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,460
I mean, like, what's that say about the game actually coming out?

907
00:45:55,460 --> 00:46:00,820
Is it, is it really gonna be out anytime soon if all of the talent is gone?

908
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,460
Or how well is it going to be supported?

909
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,300
It sounds like there's, there's little chance of DLC.

910
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,780
What happens if there's issues that need to be patched out?

911
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:12,500
I mean, you know, there, there might be enough of a crew left to handle some of those things,

912
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:17,500
but yeah, it doesn't, it doesn't speak very well of the confidence level that people are

913
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,500
supposed to have in this game.

914
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:24,460
I mean, it's one thing to support a company that treated its employees so terribly, but

915
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:30,060
the reality is most people looking at the PlayStation 4 don't listen to gaming podcasts

916
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,640
or follow gaming Twitter or any of that stuff.

917
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,020
They're not going to know that this is going on.

918
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:38,580
So they're going to say, oh, this game looks like something I might enjoy and just buy

919
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,580
it.

920
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:45,780
But is that going to, you know, is it going to be a, end up being a bad purchase?

921
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:46,780
I don't know.

922
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:50,700
I guess the, the reviews will tell, um, it'll be interesting to see if the reviews take

923
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:54,140
any of this stuff into account because they really probably shouldn't, but it's going

924
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,420
to be hard not to mention it.

925
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:00,280
Like, like maybe it doesn't affect the score, but it's like, oh, this whole other thing's

926
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,280
going on.

927
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,420
So it made us very curious to see how this game turned out and that whole thing, um,

928
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:10,340
Jack Defton in our chat over Twitch TV slash vog network says, yeah, this whole situation

929
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:14,420
sucks and I think most people following this game have pretty much lost interest, including

930
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:15,420
me.

931
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:20,080
Uh, Questbuster says the games forum on Steam, as small as it is, is filled with posts asking

932
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,740
for an official statement or just warning people off from buying it.

933
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:29,440
Ah, that's already not some good signs early on because you do need those loyal fans to

934
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,460
kind of push your sales day one.

935
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:36,460
Uh, and if you don't have that, that could be detrimental unless, you know, they've worked

936
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:39,220
out some deal with Sony for really good placement in the store.

937
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,220
I don't know.

938
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:46,160
Uh, how do you think this ultimately affects the game's release Loki or dark soccer, anybody?

939
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:50,740
I mean delayed, I don't know.

940
00:47:50,740 --> 00:48:01,380
Um, it's, it's not like, like companies haven't lost, um, lost, uh, games before, lost the

941
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:06,460
data for their games, had to rebuild part of it, um, server crashes, et cetera.

942
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:13,980
It's, it's something that a good developer should have a contingency plan for.

943
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,500
They should make backups, they should have other copies.

944
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,700
I mean, that's just common fucking sense.

945
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,700
Yeah.

946
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:25,220
And if they don't and it forces them to delay, then shame on them that their own damn fault.

947
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:26,220
Yep.

948
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:27,220
All right.

949
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:30,860
Well, we'll see what develops with this game, uh, as it gets closer to release.

950
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:34,340
And if the, uh, a company ever puts out an official statement or not, but if they haven't

951
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:38,140
at this point, I'm not sure they will, they might be hoping people will forget, um, by

952
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:40,020
the time the game releases.

953
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,020
We'll see.

954
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,020
All right.

955
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:45,980
Anyhow, let's move on and talk about, um, another kind of employee uprising.

956
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:49,860
This of a very different sort though, and this with a much bigger company, uh, this

957
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:54,500
has to do with Activision blizzard, you know, um, Activision blizzard just this past week

958
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:59,980
was talking about their quarter two for 2020 record results for growth, which doesn't surprise

959
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:03,780
me that video games across the board are doing very well right now in this whole pandemic

960
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:04,780
situation.

961
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,300
You have a lot of folks that are staying at home playing video games, and I'm sure there

962
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:11,660
were a lot of people that re up to their world of Warcraft sub who maybe haven't played in

963
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:14,420
a while and so on things like that.

964
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:17,820
However, uh, some other stuff that's going on at blizzard.

965
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:23,060
It was a recent report by Bloomberg news that showed, uh, that blizzard entertainment specifically,

966
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:29,020
uh, there was a spreadsheet created, uh, this past week that was in response to an internal

967
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:34,220
study that was done on pay disparity and people started filling out this spreadsheet

968
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:35,220
with salary.

969
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:39,620
It was like anonymous, like how much are you making, how much pay increases have you got?

970
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:43,260
And people started filling out with their salaries and their pay increases.

971
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:47,660
And it showed that raises fell well below expectations.

972
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:53,620
Um, the findings found that producers and engineers at blizzard can get six figure salaries,

973
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:58,140
but quality assurance, customer service, barely making minimum wage.

974
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:03,900
Um, some internal dialogue in 2018 showed that, uh, folks were kind of struggling at

975
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:08,460
their pay level, uh, that they, you know, needed more money to get by because again,

976
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:14,260
uh, blizzard headquarters is in Irvine, orange County, not that, I mean, it's not San Francisco,

977
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:15,860
but it's not much cheaper.

978
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:18,380
It's a Southern California is a very expensive place to live.

979
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:23,820
So, uh, yeah, uh, apparently a long time employee of blizzard said to Bloomberg, they

980
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:31,260
are making less than they did 10 years ago because of small raises and lack of overtime

981
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,260
hours.

982
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:33,780
They're not working as much overtime as they used to.

983
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:41,020
Uh, but again, that is a very, um, contrast to, wow, we're doing great as a company.

984
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:42,020
Wow.

985
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:45,220
But our employees are finding they're really not making a lot of money.

986
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:50,980
Um, and this went on to, um, and it's not in the story I'm looking at here, but I know

987
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:56,660
the employees were really kind of starting to band together to make some specific demands

988
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:57,660
of blizzard.

989
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:01,380
And I know one of them that I was reading about was they wanted blizzard to come up

990
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:07,300
with employee retention because blizzard was losing so many people to like riot games,

991
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,700
the developers of league of legends.

992
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:12,660
I think they're over in studio city or something, but they're also in Southern California and

993
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,220
other competition in the industry.

994
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:19,440
And of course, you know, when a long time folks leave that can really hurt morale and

995
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,140
trying to have to start over from the, from the beginning and some things and things of

996
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,140
that nature.

997
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:28,680
So, you know, blizzard, these employees are starting to make some demands and that's also

998
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:36,780
kind of getting people to see or say, wow, this may be the early form of a union forming

999
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:37,980
in the gaming industry.

1000
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:44,120
I mean, we do have a case of employees coming together and unionizing.

1001
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:48,380
It's just not under the, uh, an official, you know, thing that they're paying into or

1002
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:51,460
anything like that, but they're coming together to make some demands.

1003
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:55,380
Uh, and that's, um, pretty, pretty interesting.

1004
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:59,340
Um, another kind of, oh yeah, no, I think this is a great thing.

1005
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:00,340
And I think you're gonna see what we're coming to.

1006
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:02,220
I was going to say one thing.

1007
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:03,220
Oh, one thing.

1008
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,220
Oh, I thought you said good thing.

1009
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,220
Yeah.

1010
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:06,220
What?

1011
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:10,700
This goes back to something that actually should be universal in a lot of jobs where

1012
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,500
you have income transparency.

1013
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:17,300
Um, you know, you, you, you work at a place and they say, oh, don't show this to your

1014
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,300
coworkers.

1015
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,300
Don't tell them what you make.

1016
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,300
This is private, blah, blah, blah.

1017
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,940
The thing is that they don't want you to tell other people so that people will say, oh,

1018
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:28,540
I'm not making what I'm worth, you know, for people doing the same job.

1019
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:32,940
And I think that we're starting to see a lot more, you know, people in other companies

1020
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:35,180
start to be a lot more transparent with their income.

1021
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,220
And I think this is fantastic.

1022
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:42,700
And I really want this to be, uh, considered a, I'd say a more universal example.

1023
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:45,820
I would love to see this encourage other people to do it.

1024
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:48,940
And I definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely think that this should be the start

1025
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:50,300
of a union.

1026
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,380
The video game industry must unionize.

1027
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:59,000
Yeah, there's, there's so much I want to say on that due to the nature of like what I do

1028
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,300
now for work versus what I did a couple of years ago.

1029
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:04,060
But I really don't want to get into my day job, but there's so much like, I want to like

1030
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,820
elaborate about some of the differences and fascinating things.

1031
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:15,220
So, but, well, I will say, as, as, you know, a lot of women have learned, you know, when

1032
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:19,300
we start speaking out about our salaries and hearing what our male counterparts are making,

1033
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:22,500
um, the income disparity becomes very obvious.

1034
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:28,940
What you see from across the range of, of diversity, you'll, you'll find people with

1035
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:31,580
different backgrounds making more or less than others.

1036
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:35,300
You'll see, uh, it across, you know, the racial board as well.

1037
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:43,780
So I really am so proud of all of these people with their transparency.

1038
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:45,820
And I just lost dark soccer for a minute there.

1039
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:47,020
I don't know if that's a discord crash.

1040
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,020
Oh, no, you're back.

1041
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,020
Yeah, it was a weird pickup.

1042
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:50,020
Sorry.

1043
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:51,580
I was gonna say, hold their asses to the fire.

1044
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:56,580
Be honest, be transparent, but I want to see this turn into a movement in the video game

1045
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,580
industry.

1046
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:58,580
Hmm.

1047
00:53:58,580 --> 00:53:59,580
Okay.

1048
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:07,140
Now, I'm not sure if the disparity in gender is something that's showing here, just to

1049
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,140
be fair.

1050
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:12,340
I don't see it in this article here that that is an issue at blizzard specifically.

1051
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:15,420
No, I know, I know, but I just want to make that clear.

1052
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:19,460
Um, that's a different thing, um, and still bad.

1053
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:25,540
Um, but one thing that is brought up is how about Bobby Kotick as the CEO of Activision

1054
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:28,900
blizzard and what is he making compared to the average worker?

1055
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:33,660
Well, uh, Bobby Kotick made over $33 million in the year 2016.

1056
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:37,300
That is over 300 times of the average employee.

1057
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:42,060
Now there are some pro labor groups because I think there are folks out there trying to

1058
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:47,580
encourage the blizzard folks to unionize and they are happy to represent them and so forth.

1059
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:52,180
And they've done some studies, uh, showing that Kotick makes all this money because there

1060
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:58,420
are multiple overlapping award provisions that were 96.5 million in bonuses over the

1061
00:54:58,460 --> 00:54:59,740
last four years.

1062
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:04,820
That is more than the total pay of any other CEO in the gaming industry.

1063
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:09,500
He makes more in bonuses than any other CEO in the gaming industry.

1064
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:20,980
So I think that is, so dark soccer is polishing off her guillotine metaphorically, uh, but

1065
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:27,180
I mean seriously, like he's, he's making a lot of money and it's not really fair, especially

1066
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:30,980
considering what the other people in his industry are making.

1067
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:36,260
And I gotta be honest, blizzard specifically, now I know he's over Activision blizzard,

1068
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:40,460
but blizzard specific, you know, well actually Activision has not had a great last four years

1069
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:41,580
either.

1070
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,960
Blizzard hasn't had a great last two years.

1071
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:48,780
That Blizzcon a couple of years ago was a disaster.

1072
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:51,820
And so, uh, you know, that wasn't good for them.

1073
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:55,040
So why is he getting bonuses for how that Blizzcon went over?

1074
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:59,000
Why is he getting bonuses for how destiny two launched?

1075
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Yike.

1076
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,800
So that is something the employees and so forth will have to figure out, I suppose.

1077
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,800
All right.

1078
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,920
We need to, I am just, I'm all for this though.

1079
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,760
I just want to see people held accountable.

1080
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,760
That's it.

1081
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:16,760
I do too.

1082
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,600
I think it's great that people are starting to more openly discuss these things in the

1083
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,120
gaming industry.

1084
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:27,560
And you know, I think, I think that the day of reckoning for, uh, you know, basically

1085
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:32,800
abusing the enthusiasm of folks wanting to work in the game industry, cause that's what

1086
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:37,160
a lot of this amounts to because for so many years it's been, well, if you don't like what

1087
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,840
you do fucking leave, cause there's 10 kids that'll gladly take your spots.

1088
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,880
They can work in video games and you know, that's been the attitude in the gaming industry

1089
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,220
for a long time.

1090
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:50,200
And I really feel like the day of reckoning for that is overdue and it's coming.

1091
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,200
It's coming.

1092
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:58,360
The industry is another industry, you know, at the end of the day and because it's such

1093
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:04,940
a common aspect now of everyday industry, you know, it's as, it's as common as I'd say

1094
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:08,800
any manufacturing job, massive design jobs.

1095
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,960
It's a big corporation.

1096
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:14,840
You know, the, the whole aspect of its economy is, you know, massive corporations, people

1097
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:20,440
that are, you know, it's like the thing now is to be the independent developer, making

1098
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,640
it big.

1099
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:25,720
That's really going to be the bit of a rarity just because you can say, Oh, well now I'm

1100
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:30,040
working at, at square, you know, or squinnix or, or whatever.

1101
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,400
Yeah, it's cool.

1102
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,920
But in the end, you know, it's a job.

1103
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:40,280
If it pays your bills, I mean, it would be great to say, yeah, I'd like to work for,

1104
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:43,400
you know, um, you know, so and so company, that would be awesome.

1105
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,960
I love the company that I work for and I find it amazing that I work there.

1106
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:54,440
I can't, you know, say who, but at the end of the day, the job that you have is as good

1107
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,440
as number one.

1108
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,840
If you enjoy it, number two of the company takes care of you for the work that you give

1109
00:57:58,840 --> 00:57:59,840
them.

1110
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:04,520
Um, Bobby, Bobby Black Wolf in our chat says, I actually work with several ex video game

1111
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,520
developers.

1112
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,280
They like working in financial banking software way more than gaming.

1113
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:14,760
You know, that's how I feel about radio, honestly, like if you want to, you want to make a comparison

1114
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:15,760
there.

1115
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,200
Cause I used to get asked all the time, especially in the early days of podcasting, especially

1116
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:23,040
when we were first on iTunes and we were, you know, showing up on the news and it was

1117
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:27,960
really kind of the height of this show's popularity to be quite candid, uh, was when we were one

1118
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,680
of the first podcasts on iTunes.

1119
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:34,480
Uh, I got asked quite frequently, why don't you work in a traditional radio?

1120
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,920
Why don't you have a great face for radio?

1121
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,720
Why don't you go work in traditional radio?

1122
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:45,280
And the answer is, um, I really like doing radio on my own terms because when I was in

1123
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:50,720
college, I studied to do TV and radio on someone else's terms and I didn't like it.

1124
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:56,680
I didn't, I don't have the, I mean, I know I get teased sometimes for ego, uh, by captain

1125
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:00,520
Matt over at Starboard Power Coupling and stuff, but I don't have the ego you need to

1126
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,820
thrive in an industry like that.

1127
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:07,880
Look at somebody that does very well like Howard Stern.

1128
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,900
You know, I realize he's controversial.

1129
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:14,000
I'm not here to say, you know, good guy, bad guy, whatever, but we can all agree he's got

1130
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,060
an ego.

1131
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:19,380
He loves himself and that's how he succeeds very well in the right over the, uh, radio

1132
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:20,380
industry.

1133
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:27,060
So, uh, yeah, as you go, but I'm lazy as she went under, Matt says at the end of the day,

1134
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:30,540
someone working in a major company shouldn't have to live with four to five roommates in

1135
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:33,780
a San Francisco apartment, but I understand that's a different situation.

1136
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:39,080
Well, you also have the issue of like San Francisco housing, but that is, as we say,

1137
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:43,500
to invoke another famous broadcaster, a whole nother Oprah.

1138
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,960
So in the meantime, let's go on to the next story.

1139
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,900
Let's talk about people who are leaving.

1140
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:54,860
Actually, just to put that into a little bit of perspective, what I pay in my mortgage

1141
00:59:54,860 --> 01:00:02,700
for my house is half of what a friend pays for an apartment that's, uh, half the size.

1142
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:03,700
Yeah.

1143
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:07,220
Just putting that out there for San Francisco versus like where I am in Sacramento.

1144
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,220
Yeah.

1145
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:11,620
San Francisco is, uh, it's, I love it.

1146
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:16,940
I love the city, but I, I could not imagine living there the way it is economically right

1147
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:17,940
now.

1148
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:18,940
It's, it's something else.

1149
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:19,940
Yeah.

1150
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:20,940
I just, I just visit my friends.

1151
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:21,940
Exactly.

1152
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:22,940
Love to see my friends.

1153
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:23,940
Yep.

1154
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:24,940
Hearts.

1155
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:25,940
I miss them all.

1156
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:31,980
So, um, how about though, as you mentioned other people leaving and this one, um, I've

1157
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:39,460
got mixed feelings about it because this person has been just a big part of Capcom for so

1158
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:47,340
long, almost 30 years, but, um, Yoshinori Ono has, uh, left, uh, is leaving, uh, Capcom

1159
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:48,340
this summer.

1160
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:52,820
And he also will have to big message about his thoughts about the criticism made to the

1161
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:53,820
Capcom pro tour.

1162
01:00:53,820 --> 01:01:01,140
Um, since, since, uh, COVID-19, it has moved entirely online, but his statement, uh, he

1163
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:04,860
first acknowledged that, which was, I'd say pretty classy and, you know, his quote says

1164
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:08,740
it took a long time for us to decide the format for this year, but we believe that conducting

1165
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:13,180
the event itself would repay those who have been supporting the CPT, regardless of what

1166
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:14,700
format it is.

1167
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:18,900
And then he goes on to say, and now after serving almost 30 years at Capcom, I'm leaving

1168
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,460
the company this summer.

1169
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:25,660
This means I will resign my position as brand manager for Capcom's various titles, including

1170
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:26,980
street fighter.

1171
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:30,460
Um, and he worked on, on a bunch of great stuff.

1172
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:35,940
He worked on mega man series, dead rising, devil may cry, but he's really one of the

1173
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:40,420
ones who was behind getting street fighter back on this forward motion, starting with

1174
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:45,780
street fighter four, um, which honestly, I think I prefer to street fighter five, but

1175
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:46,780
I digress.

1176
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:52,420
Um, but anyway, um, he, he says he's really excited to see what's going to happen to see

1177
01:01:52,420 --> 01:02:00,780
what it's like in someone's new hands, but, um, but you know, it is, it is a, a massive

1178
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,140
torch to pass on.

1179
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:08,540
You're going to need someone who can take that up and then he can keep going with it.

1180
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:13,640
I mean, but keep in mind, you know, there's also a few things about, oh no, that people

1181
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,020
don't seem to remember.

1182
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:16,660
He got demoted twice.

1183
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:21,660
Um, you know, it was supposed to say, you know, one of the things that street fighter

1184
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:26,100
six was supposed to be released next year, but the testing ended up being absolutely

1185
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:29,660
a disaster and they hired another director to start it over from scratch.

1186
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:37,020
He also gave a street fighter cross Tekken, which, you know, pretty much bombed, um, you

1187
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:41,500
know, so keep in mind, it's because we're all still waiting for Tekken cross street

1188
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:48,780
fighter, but at any, but at any rate, yeah, the, the whole thing is that while he's done

1189
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:54,300
a lot of amazing things, he does have some pretty big fails, um, you know, in his portfolio

1190
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:55,580
as well.

1191
01:02:55,580 --> 01:03:06,220
So, um, hopefully him taking a step back might be another revitalization for, uh, for Capcom.

1192
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:10,420
I mean, I'd love them to revisit, you know, older fighting games that they did before.

1193
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:15,140
Like I would love a red earth, um, you know, to come out like a newer red earth game or

1194
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:17,700
just a release of red earth for my home system.

1195
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:22,300
I am a hundred percent with VG realness and chat, give us Capcom versus SNK three.

1196
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:26,940
That is like probably my favorite 2d fighter period is, uh, CVS too.

1197
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:27,940
Yeah.

1198
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:28,940
I enjoy that.

1199
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:35,100
I mean, I do also though greatly enjoy the Marvel versus, uh, Capcom series a whole lot,

1200
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:40,140
but, um, you know what I want them to bring back is I want them to do another Tatsunoko

1201
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:45,820
versus Capcom, but like, just weren't there rumors about that, making a comeback like

1202
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:51,380
a second game, I guess they just kind of fizzled or better than that rival schools, give us

1203
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:55,140
another, um, you've been on that 18 years.

1204
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:56,140
You've been on that one.

1205
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:57,140
I have.

1206
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:58,140
And you know what?

1207
01:03:58,140 --> 01:03:59,140
I'm fucking right.

1208
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:06,260
You know, I'm going to reply to that, say, okay, now rival school three, I'm just going

1209
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:07,260
to make a trend.

1210
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,500
We're going to make rival schools three trend again.

1211
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,500
Y'all let's get to it.

1212
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:16,020
If we made president cat happen, we are going to make rival schools three.

1213
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:18,940
There's that ego we were talking about earlier and I was right.

1214
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:19,940
And I'm right.

1215
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:21,500
I am right.

1216
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:27,060
And I will, I will go down with this burning boat fire.

1217
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:29,500
You know, I am right.

1218
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:32,700
She's she's, she's laying down the blanket on that Hill.

1219
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,660
Cause she's ready to die on it.

1220
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:36,780
Fuck that.

1221
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:41,020
I will emulate myself on that Hill.

1222
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:44,380
Burning rage of rage.

1223
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,800
Nothing says, I love you.

1224
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:48,900
Like setting the Hill on file fire with my corpse.

1225
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:49,900
Exactly.

1226
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:50,900
Exactly.

1227
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:56,660
And, and there will be a special explosion afterwards where my burning remnants will

1228
01:04:56,660 --> 01:05:06,420
spell out Kanji for she needs to justice got Gwen, the end, uh, looking in chat for some

1229
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:07,420
other comments.

1230
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:11,860
Um, somehow we, uh, got off the topic of Yoshinori Ono.

1231
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:13,300
Um, let's see.

1232
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:16,260
As she, 100 Matt says, I was shocked about Ono leaving.

1233
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:18,580
He was the face of street fighter and a really neat guy.

1234
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:21,980
I remember him in New York comic con going around the show floor, shaking everyone's

1235
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:24,620
hands and posing for pictures and having fun.

1236
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,820
The guy was always humble and cool with fans.

1237
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:27,820
Yeah.

1238
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:31,320
He does seem to have like, and I love seeing that guy on stage.

1239
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,140
Like he, he does have a presence.

1240
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:38,900
I mean, I realized that doesn't necessarily mean that's going to translate to street fighter

1241
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,500
six is going to be great.

1242
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:44,820
Like there, those are two very different roles and I don't mean to slander or talk negative

1243
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:45,820
of Ono.

1244
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:46,820
Cause I don't know.

1245
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:47,820
I didn't play street fighter six.

1246
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:49,740
I don't know what he's like from eight to five.

1247
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:54,580
What I do know is that he is great with fans and he is a real joy to see at these events

1248
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:58,020
with his enthusiasm and everything that he does when he talks about the games and all

1249
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,020
that stuff.

1250
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:05,020
So I feel like somebody's gonna snatch him up just to be an ambassador for their product.

1251
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:12,920
If nothing else, or he's going to do something on his own, you know, Oh, I should get my

1252
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:13,920
tinfoil hat.

1253
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,620
I need a tinfoil hat or something that I can put on.

1254
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:17,620
You ready for this?

1255
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:22,420
Do you know, do you know who should hire Yoshinori Ono to do hype?

1256
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:25,420
Konami?

1257
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:26,420
No.

1258
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:27,420
They need something.

1259
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:28,420
No.

1260
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:29,420
Good call, but no.

1261
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:30,420
They need a kick up the ass.

1262
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:31,420
American company.

1263
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:34,420
Microsoft.

1264
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:35,420
Microsoft.

1265
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:36,420
Microsoft.

1266
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:37,420
No.

1267
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:38,420
Yep.

1268
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:39,420
No.

1269
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:40,420
Yep.

1270
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:43,420
Because I, they need more Japanese talent, that's for sure, because that's an audience

1271
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:47,220
they haven't managed to draw in ever.

1272
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:48,820
I'm just throwing it out there.

1273
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:55,820
I think, and I think just no matter what country you're in, his enthusiasm is infectious.

1274
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:56,820
Just saying.

1275
01:06:57,820 --> 01:06:58,820
Okay.

1276
01:06:58,820 --> 01:06:59,820
All right.

1277
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:01,820
SS200Matt says, that's plausible.

1278
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:03,420
Well, anything is.

1279
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:05,820
VGRealness says, who is Konami?

1280
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:06,820
I don't know her anymore.

1281
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:10,820
Maybe we'll have some Konami news later in the show, but for now, Loki.

1282
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:12,820
Yeah.

1283
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,820
Let's talk about Rock City instead.

1284
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:21,420
So Rock City, of course, most recently known for making some pretty awesome Batman Arkham

1285
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:22,420
games.

1286
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:29,420
They have announced an announcement that's going to be at DC Fandom, August 22nd, for

1287
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:32,420
a Suicide Squad game that they're doing.

1288
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:40,420
And right now, they've also registered the domain SuicideSquadKilledTheJusticeLeague.com.

1289
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:42,420
That's a mouthful.

1290
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:43,420
Yes.

1291
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:50,020
So basically, apparently, it looks like the premise based on the crosshairs on the back

1292
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:55,020
of Superman's head is some sort of premise that the Suicide Squad, I guess, is going

1293
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:57,020
to be going after the Justice League.

1294
01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:58,020
It sounds interesting.

1295
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:04,020
It's almost like a Suicide Squad version of The Boys, I guess.

1296
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:07,020
But yeah, I'm down.

1297
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:09,020
I guess we'll have to wait and hear the details on that.

1298
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:12,020
But I know the Batman Arkham games are pretty awesome.

1299
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:17,620
And I, despite the movie not being that great, did like Suicide Squad.

1300
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:20,620
So I'm interested.

1301
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:21,620
Yeah.

1302
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:22,620
I'm curious to see what they do.

1303
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:23,620
I'm kind of with you.

1304
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:29,620
I'm like, you know, Suicide Squad is kind of like, eh, but as a movie or whatever.

1305
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:34,820
But knowing that Rocksteady did such amazing work with Batman, I feel like they will make

1306
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:38,620
Suicide Squad into something that would be really good for a game.

1307
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:39,620
I'm trying to believe.

1308
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:40,620
I want to believe.

1309
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:41,620
Yeah.

1310
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:45,220
Well, they have the new movie coming, and that looks pretty good.

1311
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:46,220
That's true.

1312
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:51,220
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, the Suicide Squad game has been rumored for at least five years.

1313
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:53,220
That's probably how long it's been taking them to make it.

1314
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:54,220
I mean, these...

1315
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:58,220
Well, now all we need is a Harry Potter game announcement that's been rumored just as long.

1316
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:00,220
It won't get my money.

1317
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:02,220
Didn't something leak with that?

1318
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:10,220
And it's because the whole J.K., J. Karen Rowling and her constant foot in her fucking mouth

1319
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:12,820
and all the shitty things she said on Twitter.

1320
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:15,820
I feel like some of that started to leak out with that game that they're making.

1321
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:19,820
And some people are just trying to tell EA or whoever was making it, back away.

1322
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:21,820
Make a generic wizard game.

1323
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:28,820
Don't put Harry Potter on it because she's tying herself.

1324
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:32,820
She is setting herself on fire and dying on a really stupid hill.

1325
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:33,820
Yeah.

1326
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:34,820
Anyway.

1327
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:39,820
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, they were rumored to be in development with it since 2013 when

1328
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:41,420
it was teased in Arkham Origins.

1329
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:42,420
Yeah.

1330
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:45,420
I mean, honestly, games take a long time to make.

1331
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:47,420
And it's probably in a newer engine or something.

1332
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:50,420
It's something where maybe the first game will take a long time, but we'll probably

1333
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:54,420
get like three Suicide Squad games over six years.

1334
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:59,420
Or they could just do the same action for more Batman games or who knows?

1335
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:00,420
Who knows?

1336
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:01,420
Anything's possible.

1337
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:02,420
All right.

1338
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:03,420
Moving on.

1339
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:06,420
Something that won't be coming out as soon as we thought, although I'm not entirely surprised

1340
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:07,420
by this.

1341
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:13,020
But there was a video that was released this week by Intellivision.

1342
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:17,820
Tommy was hyping it up and Intellivision was tweeting it out as it was a live broadcast,

1343
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:18,820
but it really wasn't.

1344
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:21,820
It was a premiere of an edited broadcast.

1345
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:22,820
Okay.

1346
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:23,820
Whatever.

1347
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:24,820
Fine.

1348
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:25,820
It was a direct of sorts.

1349
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:26,820
We'll leave it at that.

1350
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:28,620
It was like an Intellivision direct.

1351
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:32,740
And it was fine, but it did kick off with the news that the Intellivision amico was

1352
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:35,960
going to be delayed until April 2021.

1353
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:42,880
After the original October 2020 launch date and a very personal moment from Tommy Tallarico

1354
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:48,120
in the beginning there, where he talked about how the 10 10 20 date was really tied to something

1355
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:51,760
that he had promised for his sister and was openly kind of talking about that she passed

1356
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:59,880
away and was getting very emotional, which is not something you often see in CEO deliveries.

1357
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:03,800
But it was certainly impactful that you could tell that he didn't want to do this, but he

1358
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,280
knows it's for the best.

1359
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,240
And honestly, in disclosure, I've already backed.

1360
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:13,240
Well, it's not really backing, but I preordered amico or whatever you want to call it.

1361
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:17,000
And I'm not mad about this.

1362
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,840
It's one of these things where it's like, well, it's just another thing that COVID ruined.

1363
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,060
But I don't blame Tommy.

1364
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:24,160
I don't blame Intellivision.

1365
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:26,240
I don't blame anything but COVID.

1366
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:29,240
I blame our government's mismanagement of COVID.

1367
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:32,840
But again, that is a whole nother episode of a different show.

1368
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:38,000
So it is what it is and it's getting delayed till April as a result.

1369
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,640
I do think it's cute that they're trying to get the backer systems out now.

1370
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:42,640
What is it?

1371
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:43,640
April 3rd, 2021.

1372
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:45,700
So it's four, three, two, one.

1373
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:48,320
Like Tommy does have an obsession with numbers.

1374
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:53,520
I think like he has to have I wonder if he's like marketing sense, Rob.

1375
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,520
It's just market.

1376
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:55,520
It is.

1377
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,520
It is.

1378
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:00,640
But I'm kind of like, well, will he not release games when Friday is on a 13th and I don't

1379
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:01,640
I'm just teasing.

1380
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:06,040
I'm just having a hard time still being interested in the system.

1381
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:13,760
Like I like I watched the whole presentation that they had and not not to say that everything

1382
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:14,960
looks terrible.

1383
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,520
I think things look fine.

1384
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:19,800
There are some games that seem interesting, but there's a lot of games that seem very

1385
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:20,800
generic.

1386
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,560
Like it looks like a generic flash game being thrown on the system.

1387
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:29,400
And honestly, like that's not what I would want to like throw out there is like bring

1388
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,400
people in and make them excited about it.

1389
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:35,000
There was a there was a shmup game that they had on there looked pretty cool.

1390
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:41,480
There was some of the more retro reimagined versions of like I want to say it was Breakout

1391
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:44,760
or something that looked pretty cool.

1392
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:45,760
I think there's some.

1393
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:46,760
OK.

1394
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:47,760
So they just very generic.

1395
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,680
You know, you know, this criticism is coming, though, and I think something you have to

1396
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:54,640
remember and keep in the back of your mind is that this system is not for you.

1397
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:58,840
I understand that, but it doesn't just because it's an underpowered system doesn't mean that

1398
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:01,860
you can't make things look nice or put polish on them.

1399
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:03,180
And I guess it's still early.

1400
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:05,280
The games aren't out yet, but it is early.

1401
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:09,840
And I think, you know, I think some of the games honestly to me are looking good enough,

1402
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:13,040
especially for, you know, the fact that none of the games are going to cost over eight

1403
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,040
dollars.

1404
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:16,240
I think the Breakout game looks very good.

1405
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:17,920
I think the racing game will be cool.

1406
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:21,640
Like I could give or take the cornhole or some of those other things.

1407
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:27,240
But I also but I kind of also remember in the back of my mind, you know, he really wants

1408
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:33,360
to pitch this to an audience and a household that doesn't usually adopt video games.

1409
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:39,520
This is pitching for, hey, how about for family game night on Tuesday, you try this new game

1410
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,340
from Intellivision Amico.

1411
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:46,100
And I think it is a little bit of a gamble, but I'm not so sat on the that he's going

1412
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:47,100
to fail.

1413
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:50,480
Well, I wouldn't be if I would have preordered one if I thought, oh, he's going to fail because

1414
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,020
I don't think he will.

1415
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:58,500
But I think a big part of the success of this thing is going to hinge on getting the right

1416
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:00,640
messaging out.

1417
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:05,100
And I think for that reason, the three of us and those you out there listening to this

1418
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:08,260
and watching this probably won't be seeing a lot of it.

1419
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:13,580
And that's OK, because, again, it's not really for the audience that's looking for gaming

1420
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:16,340
podcasts and gaming news and stuff.

1421
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:19,400
But if he isn't, you know, some of this came up on Bobby's show.

1422
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:23,760
If he's teaming up with, you know, Ellen or well, I guess, you know, Ellen isn't much

1423
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:24,980
longer for TV.

1424
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:29,900
He's teaming up with Kelly Clark, Kelly Clarkson, let's say, or Oprah, you know, the daytime

1425
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:31,840
TV stuff.

1426
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,300
That's the way to do it and to get into some of those.

1427
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:37,540
And, you know, I think this is the type of thing that should like have a booth at the

1428
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:39,740
State Fair.

1429
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:45,520
And if they're teaming up with MLB, then when they wish they are, then when baseball comes

1430
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:49,960
back someday, this thing should be on display at baseball games.

1431
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:53,620
If they're teaming up with Sesame Street, this thing should be on display at Sesame

1432
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:54,960
Street on ice.

1433
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:58,500
When these things come back, obviously, in the pandemic world, we can't think of those

1434
01:14:58,500 --> 01:14:59,500
things right now.

1435
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:02,040
But you guys know what I mean long term.

1436
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:04,560
This thing should show up at those types of family friendly events.

1437
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:07,340
And I think if that happens, it'll do fine.

1438
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:12,040
And for me, as a mid-core gamer or whatever you want to call me, the reason why I'm still

1439
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:17,020
kind of interested in Amico, even if, yeah, not all the games look like I'm going to be

1440
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:22,320
thrilled by it, but I am really interested in the retro reimagined stuff, you know?

1441
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:28,280
And I'm trying to put on my hat for what made Atari 2600 games good or what made the original

1442
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:30,080
Intellivision games good.

1443
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:34,440
Sometimes it was just a very simple concept that was fun to, you know, like look at a

1444
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:35,440
game like Astro Smash.

1445
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,440
Market dominance.

1446
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:37,440
Yeah, well.

1447
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,920
Market dominance for Atari, sorry.

1448
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:43,560
Yes, but even if I were to go back to old Intellivision games, there's a lot of those

1449
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:47,160
I could play over and over and over again, like Astro Smash is a really fun one, right?

1450
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:48,320
And they're reimagining it.

1451
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:53,200
Missile Command is a lot of fun, which is, I know it's weird because the Atari properties

1452
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:57,440
are bleeding over into Intellivision with this retro reimag, because, you know, Breakout's

1453
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:01,600
coming, Missile Command's coming, and they're Atari properties, but whatever.

1454
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:08,040
I still think those games, they're very classic simplicity, easy to explain and get into,

1455
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:11,480
I think will lend itself well to that system.

1456
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:16,200
We just talked about why is Fall Guys doing so well?

1457
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,320
Because you don't have to explain it.

1458
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:21,480
You can figure it out really easy by watching somebody else do it.

1459
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:26,380
And every Amico game, for better or for worse, is going to be like that.

1460
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:30,480
And I think there are going to be some winners and some losers, but you know what?

1461
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:33,560
Every console has some winners and some losers.

1462
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:40,640
Now to be fair and to be critical where I should be when it comes to Intellivision Amico,

1463
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:46,100
I think their biggest challenge is going to be Nintendo Switch.

1464
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:51,760
And that $250 price tag is going to put them $50 under a Nintendo Switch, which is the

1465
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:57,400
other system, and that's the Disney of consoles and what you think of when you think of family

1466
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,880
friendly games today.

1467
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:06,360
Now obviously the big difference is that Mario and Zelda and Animal Crossing and those games

1468
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:09,400
are still going to cost you $50, $60.

1469
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:12,760
Amico's not going to have anything over $8.

1470
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:18,660
The make or break is going to be how well that messaging gets out there that the games

1471
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:21,080
are $8 or less.

1472
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:24,280
And that is, for me, that is what is key.

1473
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:29,280
He's got to get the message out that yes, it's a $250 system, but the games are never

1474
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,360
going to be over $8, ever.

1475
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:36,640
And I think if he can get that out there, that will be what brings in the people that

1476
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,340
don't usually get into games.

1477
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:42,280
Because I think there are a lot of people out there that go, games are $60, I don't

1478
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,800
want to buy $60 for a game, that's too damn expensive.

1479
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:45,800
I can't afford that.

1480
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:50,800
Especially if they're pushing to put games up to $70 and you have all the DLC and stuff,

1481
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,120
then yeah, that'll look really attractive.

1482
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:59,600
Ooh, I love this point from Pixel Pacas in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.

1483
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:04,640
Rock Band Beatles sold hardcore when they had it on QVC.

1484
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:07,600
Not that Rock Band had issues selling to begin with, though.

1485
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:12,980
That's a great example of messaging in a place where you wouldn't expect to see it.

1486
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:17,400
Or you wouldn't, like as a gaming hardcore fan or what at mid-core, we wouldn't expect,

1487
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:20,120
oh, they sell video game consoles on QVC?

1488
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:21,400
Intellivision Amico?

1489
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:26,900
I hope Tommy's got QVC on speed dial and is booking his appearance on QVC.

1490
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:29,200
That's a great idea, honestly.

1491
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:33,680
VG Realness in chat, hmm, that's going to be a challenging sell, I feel.

1492
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:38,020
Why do I need to pay $250 for a system that only has $8 games?

1493
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:40,320
It's going to be a mixed message to some people.

1494
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:43,560
So again, I think that message is going to be key.

1495
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:47,560
So I doubt Tommy listens to every little thing on the Intellivision, but if he's listening

1496
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:50,400
to this, I think that is your key need.

1497
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:56,720
You've got to be able to make people clearly understand the games are $8 or less.

1498
01:18:56,720 --> 01:19:01,480
And you've got to convince the soccer moms and the QVC watchers and the Kelly Clarkson

1499
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,720
daytime talk show watchers and all that.

1500
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:06,760
So all right, let's move on.

1501
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:11,640
We got a lot more stories to cover, including something a little near and dear to our heart.

1502
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:16,760
Speaking of the retro games, I suppose, of sorts that we used to play, things that Orange

1503
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:19,600
Lounge Radio were founded on, right?

1504
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,720
Yeah, indeed.

1505
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:26,840
And this actually is going to be coming for PC, at least what it sounds like.

1506
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:36,920
So there is an alpha of a famous Bimani series, one that we love, that's going to be coming

1507
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:43,400
to PC, and that is Gitarora, as in Guitar Freaks and Dramania.

1508
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:47,800
There is an open alpha that's available for anyone with the Japanese Konami ID, that needs

1509
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:53,280
to have to find mine, and they're talking about it's probably going to be a subscription.

1510
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:59,120
There's only four songs in the alpha right now, two have them have classic charts from

1511
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:06,300
original Gitarora, and then they're also supporting guitar controllers and electric drum sets.

1512
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:11,640
So it'd be nice, I mean, I think it would, you know, it's a really neat thing, it's definitely

1513
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:15,040
a way to bring that back now, especially for people who can't really get the arcade

1514
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:20,520
experience anymore, and there'd be people who miss it, honestly enough, you know, Rockman's

1515
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:23,400
kind of dead for now.

1516
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:26,160
And SSG 100 Matt says, I hope this isn't a beat and groovy situation.

1517
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,160
It's not.

1518
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:34,160
The fact that it's coming out in the Japanese market is different.

1519
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:38,560
Yeah, they're not trying to dumb it down for the US like they did beat and groovy.

1520
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,560
Yeah, which is insulting.

1521
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:47,720
But anyway, and other news related to that, there's gonna there is a pro arcade accurate

1522
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:53,200
controller that you can order for release when this when the game's available called

1523
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,960
the key teller.

1524
01:20:55,960 --> 01:21:07,600
And it is a white guitar with a brown neck, it looks pretty neat, has the switches and

1525
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:10,040
everything.

1526
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:18,080
And this is, it looks pretty neat, you know, I'm not I'm not gonna complain about it.

1527
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:22,880
It looking at the pictures of it as it's being held, it looks like it'd be nice and comfortable,

1528
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:28,120
you know, maybe I'd say a little bit more like what the rock band controllers are, I

1529
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:33,120
think they're a little bit a little bit more on on line with that one.

1530
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,860
It only is a PC one.

1531
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:46,260
It's coming from the, the specialist controller, sorry, it's a it's a group that does specialty

1532
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:50,020
rhythm game controllers, DJ Dow.

1533
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:52,900
And so it looks, it looks really cool.

1534
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:57,020
We get, we get a pretty accurate controller, I think that's gonna be neat, although what

1535
01:21:57,020 --> 01:22:03,060
I'm probably gonna end up doing if I go for all of this is get maybe the, the port converter

1536
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:09,500
for my, my current guitars, because you know, I've still got all of my bimani stuff, all

1537
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:15,140
of it, you know, and all of it, I'm Jason kind of name checked in the intro tonight

1538
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:20,000
that this is kind of the latest PC iteration of what is kind of in a long line of bimani

1539
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,220
games making their way to PC, right?

1540
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:29,620
Because we had Infinitas, we had the sound voltex had a PC version, a DDR, the DDR one.

1541
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:33,000
And so it makes sense that this is happening.

1542
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:39,240
I still feel disappointment that they aren't trying in Yes, I know I can go make a Japanese

1543
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:40,620
account and do all this stuff.

1544
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:43,880
I just wish Konami loved me a little more.

1545
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:46,360
Like why doesn't daddy love me?

1546
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:52,040
That's how I feel about Konami these days like it's like why will Konami not like put

1547
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:57,420
the minimal resources to try to give this a US release, especially when these games

1548
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:02,220
are at round one arcades, which yes, I know we're not going to right now in a pandemic,

1549
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:04,220
but someday we'll go back.

1550
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:09,780
You know, and I'm just hoping like, again, I would love to be able to play these games

1551
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:15,060
and know that it's in the US it's licensed for the US it's something I'm or it doesn't

1552
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:17,700
like it's region free would really be the most ideal thing.

1553
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:20,580
I'm not trying to sound like America, no one else.

1554
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:21,580
I'm not trying to do that.

1555
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:29,180
I'm just trying to say like, I wish it was open to all and made for all you know, what

1556
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:35,960
I want to see is having the American market taken seriously again, like how it was going

1557
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:40,780
with when DDR was really reaching its popularity over here.

1558
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:44,900
Although it makes sense with this being developed by the Japanese division that all the testing

1559
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:46,180
would be in Japan.

1560
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:51,460
So I'm not really I'm not really I'm sure I'm trying to let it go a little

1561
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:52,460
bit because you're right.

1562
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:56,100
And this was the same point that was brought up when I when I because I you know, I screamed

1563
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:57,100
about the DDR thing.

1564
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:58,780
I was so mad about it.

1565
01:23:58,780 --> 01:24:03,900
And you know, yeah, if it's an alpha or beta, and they're only testing in Japan, okay, cool,

1566
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:04,900
whatever.

1567
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:06,300
It would be still nice.

1568
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:11,900
It would be nice if dad would call me and say I'm sorry, it would be nice.

1569
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:19,040
If Konami Daddy would call and say, Son, I'm sorry, I'm not going to see you this year.

1570
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:22,680
But I plan to see you next year.

1571
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:27,360
Can't Konami make a phone call and say we're working on it?

1572
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,080
That's all I want.

1573
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:31,080
A Christmas card.

1574
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:38,040
All right, anything else?

1575
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:42,040
I think daddy needs to be spanked.

1576
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:45,720
That's been a bad daddy.

1577
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:46,720
Okay.

1578
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:49,280
You're gonna get us a ban on Twitch for 24 hours.

1579
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,280
You better be careful.

1580
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:51,280
All right.

1581
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:55,360
Hey, you're the one to bring it up daddy into this.

1582
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:59,680
All right, moving on to our next story quickly.

1583
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:00,680
Loki.

1584
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:02,120
All right.

1585
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:11,920
So another thing that was kind of this came out around the time of the PlayStation.

1586
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:18,720
Their little event was a another exclusive character that's going to be coming to Marvel's

1587
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:25,360
Avengers on the PlayStation, Spider-Man will be exclusive to Marvel Avengers.

1588
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:34,320
And it is probably because that Sony has this, you know, the rights to Spider-Man licensed

1589
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:35,960
for like movies and stuff.

1590
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:40,760
So I'm sure that they have it also on the console side as well with their exclusive

1591
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:42,120
games and whatnot.

1592
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:49,340
So apparently it'll be a free update for PlayStation players that's coming out when the game comes

1593
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:57,520
out in, I guess, early 2021 is when I guess, yeah, and then apparently, yeah, I'm sorry.

1594
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:01,840
So it's going to be exclusive to the PlayStation in September.

1595
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:08,960
And then apparently PC and Xbox One players won't get to actually play as that character.

1596
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:11,680
So I don't know.

1597
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:13,120
That's such a major character.

1598
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:15,600
It's kind of irritating that that's the case.

1599
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:19,200
But I get it, I guess, because they have the rights to it.

1600
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:24,480
But the way I look at it, it's not necessarily that you're basically selling me like an inferior

1601
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:31,400
product then on the other platforms is the way I look at that, which is kind of annoying.

1602
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:34,720
This shit has happened before, though, and it was annoying that, well, I don't know.

1603
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:36,880
It's sometimes annoying and sometimes not.

1604
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:39,440
I'm actually going to give you an example of when it's not annoying.

1605
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,320
And that was Soul Calibur 2.

1606
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:42,320
Now that's a throwback.

1607
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:43,320
That one's different, though.

1608
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:44,320
Yeah, that was.

1609
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,320
Yeah.

1610
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:46,320
Everybody kind of had.

1611
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:47,320
Yeah.

1612
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:48,320
Everybody kind of had their own thing.

1613
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,400
Well, do we know that that will be maybe Microsoft will get their own hero?

1614
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:52,600
No, I doubt it.

1615
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:53,600
I doubt.

1616
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,800
I mean, right now they haven't announced anything.

1617
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:58,440
So I mean, it would be cool if that was the case.

1618
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:03,280
I just don't think that there is anything right now.

1619
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:04,280
I don't know.

1620
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:06,480
It's stupid politics.

1621
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:12,760
DGRama S says, and Xbox fans are trying to get a petition going to block that exclusive.

1622
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:13,760
Lol.

1623
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,520
There's always a fucking change.org for anything.

1624
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:16,520
Let's see.

1625
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:20,560
Quest Buster in chat says Avengers has a closed preorder beta going on.

1626
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:21,920
I've seen some streams of it.

1627
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,000
I have some concerns.

1628
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:29,880
That was my general kind of feedback is I don't know that this news is a great thing

1629
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:32,560
for this game because I can't help.

1630
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:37,440
And I want to just clearly say didn't watch any of the beta streams, haven't played a

1631
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:38,440
look at the game.

1632
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:42,960
I have I'm in no position to judge this game, whether it's a good game or not.

1633
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:51,080
I can't shake this shaking feeling, this sinking feeling that this game is doomed.

1634
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:57,080
I hear it like I hear people aren't really impressed with the beta so far, so I don't

1635
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:58,080
know.

1636
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:59,280
I'm just going to wait for it to come out.

1637
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:00,480
It looked interesting at first.

1638
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:06,880
And then when I saw the trailer, it's kind of to me looking more like like Elder Scrolls

1639
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:11,400
online where like the more trailers and the more information I hear about it, the less

1640
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:13,320
excited about it I am.

1641
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:19,160
So right now I'm kind of like, eh, it just looks like an average action game.

1642
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:21,960
I mean, we'll see.

1643
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:22,960
I don't know.

1644
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:29,280
I just there's a lot of games for me to play and especially with like Cyberpunk right around

1645
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:30,280
the corner.

1646
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:32,080
So I don't really care.

1647
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:40,600
Yeah, I just I this is just some not good news on top of the pile of I have like I have

1648
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:43,240
anthem kinds of concerns for this game.

1649
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:44,640
Let's just put it that way.

1650
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:46,000
Sorry about that.

1651
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,600
I'm not there yet, but yeah, it's.

1652
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:50,600
We'll see.

1653
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:51,600
Yeah, we'll see.

1654
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:52,600
All right.

1655
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:56,720
Well, if you are still if you're still Team Microsoft, which there's no problem, there's

1656
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:58,120
plenty of reasons to be Team Microsoft.

1657
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:00,200
Oh, I want to read this comment real fast.

1658
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:03,480
VG realness and chat says, I was already met about the game.

1659
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:06,880
Now the announcement about Spider-Man, I'm just very met about it.

1660
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,800
I feel like it needs more character options.

1661
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,160
I don't feel like playing the ones they have.

1662
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:12,840
Not enough diversity in the characters.

1663
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,800
They're all punchy, punchy, throwy, throwy.

1664
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:21,320
OK, not all, but most pod culture says Mr. Smoosh is the Xbox exclusive character.

1665
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:22,320
We could dream.

1666
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:23,320
We could dream.

1667
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:24,320
All right.

1668
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,840
Anyway, I want to talk a little bit, though, about what's going on on the Microsoft side

1669
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:30,600
of things, because even if they don't have exclusive content for the Avengers yet, they

1670
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:36,640
do have something pretty big happening on September 15th, and that is Project X Cloud.

1671
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:41,840
Project X Cloud is going to be launching on September 15th on Android devices.

1672
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:45,600
There is some controversy definitely going around because apparently Apple is not allowing

1673
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,200
it through.

1674
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:52,340
We'll see if they'll work that out by September 15th, because, again, and I'll kind of let

1675
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:54,040
Bobby show kind of speak to this.

1676
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:57,880
I feel like if Spotify got their way eventually, Netflix got their way eventually, I feel like

1677
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:59,440
this is going to get worked out, too.

1678
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:03,760
But as it stands, it's only coming out on Android devices on September 15th.

1679
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:09,320
An Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription.

1680
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:13,840
So not if you are PC only and not if you are Xbox only.

1681
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:17,520
You have to have an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription.

1682
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:22,400
So if you have this, it will allow you to unlock the game streaming on X Cloud.

1683
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:29,400
Ultimate, of course, will set you back $15 a month after initial offers to get you hooked.

1684
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:35,840
Over I guess 100 games are going to be included, but they're not saying the whole library yet.

1685
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:38,960
But that could also be because games come and go on Game Pass.

1686
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:39,960
Don't know about that.

1687
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:40,960
Yeah, probably.

1688
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:47,920
I don't think that they're, like, blocking anything unless there's, like, I don't think

1689
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:51,560
there has been unless there's, like, somebody that has, like, I have exclusive streaming

1690
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:57,560
rights with, like, the Nvidia platform or whatever it is, or like EA, you know, like,

1691
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:00,640
we want our own streaming platform, which I think they have their own streaming ones

1692
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:01,640
that they're trying to do.

1693
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:04,480
Maybe they're like, well, we don't want you to stream our games or something.

1694
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:09,320
Regardless, I think it's pretty safe to say all the Microsoft Game Studio stuff is not

1695
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:10,320
going to be a problem.

1696
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:11,920
And that's that's your halos.

1697
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,320
That's your Gears of War.

1698
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:16,240
That's your Fable reboot and all this stuff.

1699
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:19,240
That's that's what a lot of people are going to be checking out anyway.

1700
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:20,800
You know, so we'll see.

1701
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,680
We'll see what kind of slips through the cracks otherwise.

1702
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:26,240
Now, X Cloud is also supposed to be coming to PC later this year.

1703
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:30,160
So you'll be able to stream game pass titles to desktop or laptop, which is weird because

1704
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:32,640
you can download a lot of the same games.

1705
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:36,020
But I understand, you know, just based on people's setup or what have you, they might

1706
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:39,160
want to stream to like a laptop or or who knows what.

1707
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:44,240
So yeah, we'll have to check that out when X Cloud comes out on September 15th.

1708
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:45,760
So we'll see.

1709
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:49,480
I know a lot of people that have been playing with the early beta and stuff speak very favorably

1710
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:50,480
of it.

1711
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:54,040
So I'm curious to try it myself and see how it works out.

1712
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:59,240
Or those fancy new phones that are being released as well, you know, what do you mean you stream

1713
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:00,240
to those?

1714
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:01,240
Oh, yeah.

1715
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:02,240
Yeah.

1716
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:03,240
So.

1717
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:04,240
All right.

1718
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:05,240
I think.

1719
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:06,240
Are you going to go Dark Sakura?

1720
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:07,240
I know you had a little spill there.

1721
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:08,240
So you're you're cleaning off cam.

1722
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:09,240
OK.

1723
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:16,280
I have some older kimono fabric that got soda on it, which means it went right in the gentle

1724
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:17,280
cycle.

1725
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,280
Yikes.

1726
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:19,280
Yikes.

1727
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:20,280
All right.

1728
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:22,080
All right.

1729
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:26,840
Meanwhile, let's get to the classic game of the week then where every week here on the

1730
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:33,080
show, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, kids,

1731
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:34,080
get off my lawn.

1732
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:35,320
Number one.

1733
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:38,800
Number two, watch me do a trick on this hill.

1734
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:42,560
Number three, go check out this classic game where she's going to walk into the gaming

1735
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:46,840
vault and find a game that she thinks all the kids should be checking out.

1736
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:48,840
And I have a few copies of it.

1737
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:51,800
And I think this one is one that a lot of our listeners will remember.

1738
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:53,600
This is a very transformative kind of game.

1739
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,600
What is the classic game of the week?

1740
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:58,440
Classic game is Virtua Racing.

1741
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:04,240
So you've also seen it as VR, but it is a Formula One racing arcade game that was developed

1742
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:07,940
by Sega and two and released in 1992.

1743
01:33:07,940 --> 01:33:13,880
It was originally considered to be a proof of concept for trying 3D graphics, which was

1744
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:18,560
supposed to be under the Model 1 because it looked so good.

1745
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:27,560
They actually fully developed it as a standalone title and it was full 3D, which I mean, MAMCO

1746
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:28,560
did it first.

1747
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:31,600
They did winning run and then Atari had hard drive in.

1748
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:37,180
But this was like a vast improvement over those.

1749
01:33:37,180 --> 01:33:43,480
It actually ran relatively smoothly in 3D and it pretty much is considered the foundational

1750
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:52,240
game for 3D racing games in general and for using polygon graphics for games going forward.

1751
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:53,240
Yeah.

1752
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:58,480
I mean, looking at the footage of this game that we're watching on Twitch, to hear you

1753
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:03,000
say this is 1992, that's the early days of the Super Nintendo.

1754
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,680
So it's like putting this side by side with F-Zero is it's like, dang, these graphics

1755
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:07,680
are real.

1756
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:09,260
But I also remember this arcade game.

1757
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:12,680
This was like you had to pay a whole dollar to play this game.

1758
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:17,720
It was not a cheap arcade game, you know, and it maybe it's probably showing its warts

1759
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:21,560
all these years later, like the draw, you know, things kind of pop in, the draw distance

1760
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:22,560
isn't amazing, all that.

1761
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:30,440
But again, if you put it in your 1992 hat, like this game for its time was transformative.

1762
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:33,320
This is what led to Grand Theft Auto and everything else.

1763
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:34,320
Sorry, go ahead.

1764
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:41,500
Well, and even for the games that followed, I mean, like Sega Rally, for example, Daytona,

1765
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:47,540
you know, while those were all textured, you know, this one here is in its beautiful

1766
01:34:47,540 --> 01:34:49,680
raw and textured glory.

1767
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:52,600
And this is, you know, what we had.

1768
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:57,340
I was playing this when I was in 10th grade, so, you know, I sucked at it.

1769
01:34:57,340 --> 01:35:02,380
But at any rate, the original arcade game had three levels with its difficulty.

1770
01:35:02,380 --> 01:35:06,540
So you had the beginner, which is big, big forest, and then you had the Bay Bridge as

1771
01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:11,560
the intermediate, and then your expert level was the Acropolis.

1772
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:17,000
And then each of them had their own feature, like an amusement park in a big forest or

1773
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:21,380
the bridge for Bay Bridge or the hairpin turns on Acropolis.

1774
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:26,560
So when you select a car, you've got your transit transmission types, you know, your

1775
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:28,160
automatic or your standard.

1776
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:34,780
You also have the VR view system that lets you choose four different views for the game.

1777
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:42,300
It was used in a lot of other Sega racing games like Daytona, and it even was in the

1778
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:47,300
home ports, which we're going to get to in a moment, please.

1779
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:52,960
So as for the cabinets, there were a few different cabinet versions there.

1780
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:55,800
There was a twin cabinet, which was the standard one.

1781
01:35:55,800 --> 01:36:01,080
It was effectively two arcade machines built into one cabinet.

1782
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:08,160
And these were, you know, pretty, pretty widespread for these.

1783
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:15,900
However, there was a, there's zenith picture tubes in the Wells Gardner 25 inch monitors

1784
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:20,560
actually ended up having a manufacturing defect that caused them to fail after a few years.

1785
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:27,300
So many of those machines were either parted out and they're a lot harder to find today.

1786
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:35,160
The twin cabinet sold everywhere else was used the 29 inch 9L monitors.

1787
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:40,100
So you won't find those, those older ones that much anymore, but they were the first

1788
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:41,100
releases.

1789
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:42,100
They were the common ones at first.

1790
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:48,460
There's also the deluxe version, which is the VRDX cabinet type, which is a single player

1791
01:36:48,460 --> 01:36:55,580
machine and has a 16, nine aspect ratio, a Hantrex monitor, which was one of the first

1792
01:36:55,580 --> 01:37:02,980
uses of widescreen aspect ratio monitors in an arcade game, six airbags.

1793
01:37:02,980 --> 01:37:10,380
So one on each side, or three on each side that would inflate so that you would be nudged

1794
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:15,500
when you're cornering or move the airbag to, you know, pull you back while you're breaking.

1795
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:22,980
So it's supposed to give you the, that feeling of motion and resistance.

1796
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:31,620
And as for a few other things, it also had a fully adjustable forward and back seat that

1797
01:37:31,620 --> 01:37:33,340
used the air pressure for it.

1798
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:40,100
It also had a force feedback steering that used a two pneumatic cylinders to rotate the

1799
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:43,680
steering wheel, which was different than the electric motor and clutch system that were

1800
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:46,020
used before.

1801
01:37:46,020 --> 01:37:50,180
So the steering would feel a little bit more true to life.

1802
01:37:50,180 --> 01:37:57,740
And Virtual Formula ended up being released in 1993, and it was unveiled at the Sega's

1803
01:37:57,740 --> 01:38:04,620
second arcade amusement park, Joypolis, and there was a room with 32 machines dedicated

1804
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:05,620
to it.

1805
01:38:05,620 --> 01:38:14,140
So Virtual Formula was a Super DX version of VR, and it put you in a full motion hydraulic

1806
01:38:14,140 --> 01:38:19,620
Formula One car replica in front of a 50 inch screen.

1807
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:27,380
And a lot of these units were converted into their IndyCar simulator, Indy 500 found at

1808
01:38:27,380 --> 01:38:30,120
Sega Gameworks in the US.

1809
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:34,220
And I think that we saw one at, I think there was one at the Gameworks in Seattle when we

1810
01:38:34,220 --> 01:38:36,220
were there.

1811
01:38:36,220 --> 01:38:39,760
Yes, there was.

1812
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:46,920
And on top of that, I believe that these same overall cabinets I've seen used for Daytona,

1813
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:52,660
and it was, yeah, I think it was roughly around that same time.

1814
01:38:52,660 --> 01:38:56,800
They had similar for Daytona, because it was the first time I saw Daytona at the Sega arcade

1815
01:38:56,800 --> 01:39:06,640
at, crap, what's that casino called that's Egyptian themed in Las Vegas, Luxor, Luxor,

1816
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:07,640
thank you.

1817
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:08,640
At Luxor.

1818
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:13,480
And that was roughly around the same time I was, I was in high school I think, yeah.

1819
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:14,480
I just want to comment.

1820
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:15,480
They were all like cars.

1821
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:18,160
I just want to comment on the video again real quick, which sorry to the podcast listeners,

1822
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:22,480
but we're watching another level, and this is the Bay Bridge level, which is really the

1823
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:23,560
Golden Gate.

1824
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:27,200
But I'm always fascinated, which obviously the geography is completely wrong, it's just

1825
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:29,520
an excuse to put something that looks like the Golden Gate in the game.

1826
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:31,400
That doesn't look like Sausalito.

1827
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:36,640
But it's, and it's not nearly long enough, but the funny thing is racing games always

1828
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:38,920
have a fascination with San Francisco.

1829
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:43,080
Like San Francisco like always, and it's because of the hills, it's because of the iconic-ness

1830
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:46,480
of the Golden Gate, so it's interesting to see it in this game too, because I feel like

1831
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:47,480
every...

1832
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:49,480
Have you seen a windmill in San Francisco?

1833
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:50,480
A what?

1834
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:51,480
A windmill in San Francisco.

1835
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:53,160
No, yeah, there's no windmills in San Francisco.

1836
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:59,360
So some of this stuff is very random, but it's fine, like you know, again, it's just

1837
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:03,600
invoking those sorts of images and making you think of that.

1838
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:04,600
Yeah.

1839
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:10,400
Going back to all the cabinets for Virtua Racing, they're linkable for up to eight players,

1840
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:15,720
so four twin units, or eight DX, UR, or Virtua Formula cabinets can be linked together, and

1841
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:18,000
they use fiber optic cables for this.

1842
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,760
There was also an optional display called the Live Monitor that would sit atop the cabinets

1843
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:28,280
and replay action shots of what was happening in the game with kind of like a virtual sportscast

1844
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:32,200
with a commentator named Vert McPolygon.

1845
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:33,800
Yeah.

1846
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:34,800
I know.

1847
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:40,560
So anyway, for the home console versions, now I'm gonna be a little bit more verbose

1848
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:46,800
about the Sega Mega Drive or Genesis as we had it here in the US.

1849
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:53,360
This one was honestly, when this came out, it was big shit, okay?

1850
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:59,720
They couldn't do the game because of how complex the Model 1 board was, they think they were

1851
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:06,280
gonna be able to do a home console version, but in 1994, they created a cartridge design

1852
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:14,480
that used the Sega Virtua processor, which basically is an extra chip that enabled you

1853
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:18,360
to play a version like this on the Mega Drive, on the Genesis.

1854
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:20,520
It was really expensive.

1855
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:27,920
So the games, when they came out, they were 100 bucks, it was 70 pounds in the UK.

1856
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:32,080
And for what it did at the time, it was pretty amazing.

1857
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:39,280
It rendered 9,000 polygons per second in game, which was much higher than anything the Genesis

1858
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:41,800
was capable of at the time otherwise.

1859
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:48,840
However, you cannot use this on the Majesco Genesis 3, and it will not work on any Genesis

1860
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:53,400
that's equipped with a 32X, for obvious reasons.

1861
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:58,760
Now speaking of the 32X, yeah, there was a pretty awesome port, Virtua Racing Deluxe,

1862
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:02,760
which is pretty fun, and it was developed directly by Sega AM2.

1863
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:09,000
It was published by Sega under Sega Sports, and it performed very closely to the arcade

1864
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:13,560
version and had two extra cars, one called Stock and the other prototype, and two new

1865
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:16,760
tracks that were called Highland and Sand Park.

1866
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:22,240
Now of course, the good version, the one that was at the time the most accurate one that

1867
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:25,040
you could get was the Sega Saturn.

1868
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:29,800
It was, the working title was Virtua Racing Saturn, it was released in 1995, and it was

1869
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:32,480
developed and published by Time Warner.

1870
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:41,120
Of course, you could put the CD in and play the game, like the music as long as you skipped

1871
01:42:41,120 --> 01:42:43,800
the tracks, because it was all red book audio.

1872
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:50,200
I've got rips of the audio somewhere, and unlike the other versions, it has a Grand

1873
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:56,120
Prix mode, where you're driving a series of cars and tracks to earn your points as

1874
01:42:56,120 --> 01:42:57,840
you go along.

1875
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:04,160
And then there was a remake called Virtua Racing Flatout on PS2, it was released under

1876
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:10,360
the Sega Ages 2500 label, it was released in Japan in 2004, and did get an American

1877
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:15,420
and European release in 2005 as part of the Sega Classics collection, had three new courses

1878
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:17,080
and four new cars.

1879
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:21,880
And now, and you know, we're seeing more of these Sega Ages ports now on the Switch,

1880
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:27,760
so yes, there is a Virtua Racing for Switch, and it was released on April 24th, 2019 in

1881
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:32,080
Japan and elsewhere June 27th, 2019, developed by M2.

1882
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:37,120
It is an absolute port of the arcade original, with an increased frame rate of 60 frames

1883
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:40,760
per second, and in the 69 aspect ratio.

1884
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:45,320
You can play online with up to two players, and up to eight players on a single system.

1885
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:52,440
It also has online leaderboards, downloadable replays for the top 50 players on each track,

1886
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:57,520
an easier steering option, and the Grand Prix mode that increases the total number of laps

1887
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:01,240
to 20, and guess who's back?

1888
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:02,240
Vert McPolygon!

1889
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:03,240
Yay!

1890
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:07,040
He cameos in the replay.

1891
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:08,040
Love it.

1892
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:11,840
So, it was very well received.

1893
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:19,760
It was listed in their 1992 issue in October of Game Machine as their most successful upright

1894
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:26,760
arcade unit of the year, and it was also very well accepted, of course, here in the US.

1895
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:31,040
The Japanese Gamest Awards, it was nominated for Best Action, Best Direction, Best Graphics,

1896
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:35,200
then it lost to Street Fighter II Champion Edition, and then Art of Fighting, and then

1897
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:40,080
Zexus, which Zexus and, of course, Street Fighter II have been past classic games.

1898
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:42,320
I don't know if I've done Art of Fighting.

1899
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:43,320
Maybe.

1900
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:48,920
EGM called it a racing masterpiece and said, life-like racing sensations are extremely

1901
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:50,880
impressive and exciting.

1902
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:53,560
So yeah, it really got good reviews.

1903
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:57,760
The home versions got pretty great reviews.

1904
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:05,000
GamePro loved the 32X version, and they said, actually, that it addressed the longevity

1905
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:10,280
of the Genesis version with adding more stuff and giving it a little bit more replay value.

1906
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:16,800
And it was for, in 1994, it was on Mega's list of, it was fourth place on Mega's list

1907
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:21,320
for top Mega Drive games of all time.

1908
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:27,400
And so, yeah, I'm really surprised I haven't done it before, but, you know, kind of on

1909
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:32,080
this AM2 kick, so there you go, Virtua Racing.

1910
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:33,080
Classic game of the week.

1911
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:34,560
Virtua Racing.

1912
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:39,120
One that I think many people in their 30s and maybe even like late 20s probably remember

1913
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:44,280
seeing this game in an arcade somewhere and how cool it looked at the time.

1914
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:51,720
And yeah, now it's being revisited all over again by us here at OLR.

1915
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:59,560
So some comments on the use of San Francisco, oftentimes in racing games, we're talking

1916
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:01,000
about that in chat a little bit.

1917
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:06,320
Bobby Blackwolf pointed out probably also because many gaming companies are in San Francisco,

1918
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,720
and I was like, oh yeah, Sega used to be in San Francisco.

1919
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:13,000
They used to have that iconic building where 80 and 101 kind of met, and the Golden Gate

1920
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,000
is 101.

1921
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,320
I mean, you have to kind of go through the city to get to that part of it, but still

1922
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:19,160
like, you know, Sega had that iconic building.

1923
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:20,160
It's no longer there.

1924
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:23,240
It's the Zynga, or was the Zynga building, I don't even know if they're still in it,

1925
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:24,240
but you...

1926
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:25,240
I don't think so.

1927
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:26,240
I think they're out.

1928
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:30,660
Yeah, you couldn't miss that Sega logo when you used to go by there all the time.

1929
01:46:30,660 --> 01:46:35,160
And then Dark Tetsuya said, oh yeah, that might explain the first crazy taxi.

1930
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:39,520
Also a Sega game took heavy inspiration from San Francisco as well.

1931
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:42,980
So interesting point that, you know, with all the development that happens in the Bay

1932
01:46:42,980 --> 01:46:46,900
Area, go with what you know, so to speak, in what you develop.

1933
01:46:46,900 --> 01:46:47,900
That's kind of interesting.

1934
01:46:47,900 --> 01:46:51,340
I just always thought it was because of the hills, you know, people wanted to do...

1935
01:46:51,340 --> 01:46:54,740
Because everybody fantasizes about going 100 miles an hour on those hills, which is something

1936
01:46:54,740 --> 01:46:59,540
you should never do in a real car, Jesus, like those hills are actually not fun in a

1937
01:46:59,540 --> 01:47:00,540
car.

1938
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:05,020
Without the experience being in a car with me going about 90 doing a spin in San Francisco.

1939
01:47:05,020 --> 01:47:12,660
The hills in San Francisco are the most overrated part of San Francisco, to be real.

1940
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:16,580
They're beautiful, especially when you're looking out from Alcatraz, but...

1941
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:17,580
There's a story.

1942
01:47:17,580 --> 01:47:21,420
DJ Ramis just put three dots in chat, so I'm not sure he wants to see this.

1943
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:22,420
It's called an ellipsis.

1944
01:47:22,420 --> 01:47:23,420
It's still.

1945
01:47:23,420 --> 01:47:24,420
It's called an ellipsis.

1946
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:29,440
Anyway, I wanted to take him to Charger Island.

1947
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:32,960
And so I was just about to miss the turn, and this was the Lancer.

1948
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:40,040
So I effectively drifted going on that on ramp to Treasure Island.

1949
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:41,040
It was pretty fun.

1950
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:42,040
Yeah.

1951
01:47:42,040 --> 01:47:43,040
Good times.

1952
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:46,320
I'm glad we lived, and I'm glad I didn't get a ticket.

1953
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:51,440
But I'll give you my little San Francisco trick for all those of you guys that ever

1954
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:52,760
want to go visit.

1955
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:59,120
The easiest way to get around San Francisco, take your car, park it on top of a hill in

1956
01:47:59,120 --> 01:48:03,480
a neighborhood, because all the parking's free on the street at the top of a hill,

1957
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:06,680
because nobody wants to park there and walk up and down a hill.

1958
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:08,700
And then take Uber or Lyft wherever you need to go.

1959
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:10,680
It's gonna be cheaper than parking.

1960
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:13,960
That is my tired and true how I get around San Francisco.

1961
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:20,640
Or, I mean, even better than that, even better, get yourself a clipper.

1962
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:25,040
Yeah, I was gonna say, find a friend that knows that transit system like the back of

1963
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:26,040
his hand.

1964
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:28,520
You don't need anyone to do it for you.

1965
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:32,560
My iPhone will just tell me what buses to take in San Francisco.

1966
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:34,240
I'll still get on the wrong one.

1967
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:36,040
I'm bad, though, with the trains.

1968
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:37,960
I'm bad with the trains right now.

1969
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:38,960
Right.

1970
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:39,960
All right.

1971
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:42,240
Usually, I get JD to help me.

1972
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:43,240
All right.

1973
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:44,240
Let's move on.

1974
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:48,680
Let's get into some rapid fire news and quickly talk about some other news going on in the

1975
01:48:48,680 --> 01:48:49,680
industry.

1976
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:50,680
Loki.

1977
01:48:50,680 --> 01:48:57,440
Well, I'm relieved that even though we talked about a game-breaking bug in Paper Mario Origami

1978
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:00,400
King that they're already patching it.

1979
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:07,520
And so, as of right now, patch 101 is available, and it'll actually fix the issue that they

1980
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:14,360
had in the Spring of Rainbows and Shangri-Spa, and along with other issues that were apparently

1981
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:17,360
blocking progress in the game as well.

1982
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:18,680
So, that's a relief.

1983
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:24,360
Now, I can finish my game as soon as I get the console back from everybody in my household.

1984
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:30,640
Also, coming to the Switch, Pikmin 3 Deluxe, which was an announcement that happened.

1985
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:33,800
Apparently, it's coming October 30th.

1986
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:38,680
Can we get a different game instead than Pikmin?

1987
01:49:38,680 --> 01:49:43,040
I mean, really, can we not get another Pikmin game, please?

1988
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:48,360
Yeah, I'm not a big Pikmin person either, but cool for those that are.

1989
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:54,000
I know some people were really excited about it, so yay for you.

1990
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:59,560
I'm guessing we'll be getting more announcements for more games coming to the Switch later.

1991
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:03,560
I think this is definitely a Band-Aid.

1992
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:07,080
Yeah, that's it.

1993
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:11,040
Alright, then for what I was going to talk about, I have a couple quick stories here.

1994
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:14,720
So, Loki kind of spoiled this one already earlier in the show, but that's okay, because

1995
01:50:14,720 --> 01:50:17,360
we'll talk about it outside of just PlayStation.

1996
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:21,880
Braid Anniversary Edition, which Loki brought up earlier, is also coming to the Nintendo

1997
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:22,880
Switch.

1998
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:28,720
So, this new version of the game is going to have some new mixes and an upgraded soundtrack,

1999
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:29,720
if you will.

2000
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:34,480
It will have some hand-repainted graphics, some all-new animation, and you can switch

2001
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:36,960
back and forth between the old and the new Braid.

2002
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:41,920
So, it sounds like the Wonder Boy monster's trap and those types of games where you have

2003
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:44,360
the button to switch back and forth, which is always cool.

2004
01:50:44,360 --> 01:50:47,240
They're also talking about extensive developer commentary.

2005
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:52,820
So, maybe we'll find out if the ending is supposed to be deeper than the fact that you

2006
01:50:52,820 --> 01:50:53,820
were the...

2007
01:50:53,820 --> 01:50:57,900
I guess I shouldn't spoil it for those that still haven't played it after 12 years, but

2008
01:50:57,900 --> 01:50:59,900
it's a pretty...

2009
01:50:59,900 --> 01:51:02,580
It is a game, you know, I don't know.

2010
01:51:02,580 --> 01:51:05,940
I feel like this game kind of has some mixed things, because I think some people saw that

2011
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:10,260
movie and so they...

2012
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:14,700
Not everything about the development of the game was portrayed in a positive light, but

2013
01:51:14,700 --> 01:51:18,620
I know that the critics really loved this game and embraced this game, and it was an

2014
01:51:18,620 --> 01:51:19,620
interesting twist.

2015
01:51:19,620 --> 01:51:20,620
I will say that.

2016
01:51:20,980 --> 01:51:24,460
Even the game mechanics was an interesting twist on the old formulas.

2017
01:51:24,460 --> 01:51:29,100
And you have to remember this game came out when Xbox Live and the whole digital to you

2018
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:32,120
game thing was really starting to take off.

2019
01:51:32,120 --> 01:51:35,860
So I do think Braid is transformative in many ways for the industry, and it is something

2020
01:51:35,860 --> 01:51:38,460
that I'm not surprised we're revisiting.

2021
01:51:38,460 --> 01:51:39,680
It's just kind of a weird time.

2022
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:43,820
It's a random time for it, I guess, but okay, whatever.

2023
01:51:43,820 --> 01:51:49,220
Anyway, Fall Guys, which I think is also going to be a big game in our industry, just wait.

2024
01:51:49,220 --> 01:51:53,160
They are talking about bringing the game to other platforms.

2025
01:51:53,160 --> 01:51:58,100
It's an official FAQ on the game's website that talks about, will the game come to Xbox

2026
01:51:58,100 --> 01:51:59,100
or Switch?

2027
01:51:59,100 --> 01:52:02,660
To start with, Fall Guys will only be available on PS4 and Steam.

2028
01:52:02,660 --> 01:52:05,980
We'd love to bring the game to other platforms further down the line.

2029
01:52:05,980 --> 01:52:09,220
Please let us know on Twitter and Discord which platforms you'd like us to release on

2030
01:52:09,220 --> 01:52:10,220
next.

2031
01:52:10,220 --> 01:52:18,700
We'd love to see how much demand there is, which is code, I'm sure, for...

2032
01:52:18,700 --> 01:52:21,980
If you're already on it, please look forward to it.

2033
01:52:21,980 --> 01:52:26,060
All right, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

2034
01:52:26,060 --> 01:52:27,700
Oh, this and that.

2035
01:52:27,700 --> 01:52:31,340
One of them just makes me laugh my ass off, because I'm working on a novel right now,

2036
01:52:31,340 --> 01:52:34,340
so I know how much research goes into writing.

2037
01:52:34,340 --> 01:52:43,500
And this is historical fiction, and there is an author named John Boyne, who's had other

2038
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:48,040
controversy about him, wrote a historical fiction novel called A Traveler at the Gates

2039
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:57,200
of Wisdom, and he made a boo-boo in referencing a recipe for red dye.

2040
01:52:57,200 --> 01:53:01,320
And I will read it in all of its glory.

2041
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:02,320
I will get to it.

2042
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:05,760
The dyes that I used in my dressmaking were composed from various ingredients depending

2043
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:10,920
on the color required, but almost all required nightshade, sapphire, key swings, the leaves

2044
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:16,960
of the silent princess plant, Octorok eyeballs, swift violet thistle, and hightail lizard.

2045
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:22,600
I employ spicy pepper, tail of the red Lizalfos, and four Hylian shrooms.

2046
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:25,640
Love it.

2047
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:30,760
And now, though, I mean, and the screenshot was pointed on Twitter by a writer named Dana

2048
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:31,760
Schwartz.

2049
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:38,520
It was actually first posted by somebody else, but they've deactivated their account.

2050
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:41,040
But it's just, it's absolutely hilarious.

2051
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:47,960
And so the writer himself, so he, he admitted to it, he's like, and this is the quote from

2052
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:52,680
his Twitter, hey, Twitter, does anyone know how one would go about dyeing a red dress?

2053
01:53:52,680 --> 01:53:54,680
Asking for a friend.

2054
01:53:54,680 --> 01:54:04,000
Now, of course, Boyne has been in in the news before for other faux pas, big ones, the Auschwitz

2055
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:09,040
Museum stated his book, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas contained many inaccuracies about

2056
01:54:09,040 --> 01:54:12,720
the Holocaust and should not be used as teaching about the genocide.

2057
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:18,840
And then his novel in 2019, called My Brother's Name is Jessica, has also met with extreme

2058
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:24,640
criticism from the trans community for misgendering characters, and that he rejected the word

2059
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:32,080
cis as a controversial term, even though it's a fucking accurate word, so get over it.

2060
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:41,640
But at any rate, yeah, dude needs to cross reference shit when he's doing research, I

2061
01:54:41,640 --> 01:54:44,640
swear to God, anyway.

2062
01:54:44,640 --> 01:54:48,320
I'm working on my first book and I know better, okay?

2063
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:57,800
So anywho, we had covered Warner Brothers, the gaming division being up for sale, well,

2064
01:54:57,800 --> 01:54:59,680
that ain't happening now.

2065
01:54:59,680 --> 01:55:07,880
So they have released an amendment saying that they are still their own, they remain

2066
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:12,880
part of the studio networks group, they are completely still their own entities.

2067
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:19,600
So yeah, not happening, at least right now.

2068
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:25,200
All right, well, we're gonna go on to world release dates and travel around the world

2069
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:27,560
and check out what games are coming out near you soon.

2070
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:31,520
However, I do need to sneak in one more news item here because it does relate to the Voice

2071
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:36,000
Geeks Network and some of our personalities here at VOG Network.

2072
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,760
I want to give a shout out to Bobby Blackwolf because it is actually confirmed.

2073
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:43,280
And if you've been listening to his show, you've kind of heard about some of this, the

2074
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:48,300
process he's gone through to get here, but he will be a part of Summer Games Done Quick

2075
01:55:48,300 --> 01:55:49,800
as one of the announcers.

2076
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:55,000
So he did get, even though he fell in the backup category, it turns out they gave the

2077
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,600
backup hosts one shift, basically.

2078
01:55:57,600 --> 01:55:59,920
So you can check out Bobby Blackwolf.

2079
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:02,800
He's going to be announcing during Summer Games Done Quick.

2080
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:07,840
And if you want to check him out, it's going to be Wednesday, August 19th at about 10 Eastern,

2081
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:08,840
7 Pacific.

2082
01:56:08,840 --> 01:56:11,720
I say about because you never know if the speed runs are going to go short or long or

2083
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:12,720
whatever.

2084
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:17,240
But the speed run, he's going to be a host for and doing the, not the commentary because

2085
01:56:17,240 --> 01:56:20,040
the guy on the couch or virtual, it's all virtual, right?

2086
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:22,200
But the guy actually doing the speed run does the commentary, but he's going to be reading

2087
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:24,220
the donations and all that stuff.

2088
01:56:24,220 --> 01:56:29,220
That is going to be for Devil May Cry 4 will be the game that he is kind of going to be

2089
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:31,980
announcing for.

2090
01:56:31,980 --> 01:56:35,740
One thing he wanted to stress though, so I will pass this along as well.

2091
01:56:35,740 --> 01:56:39,380
Summer Games Done Quick is about the charity, Doctors Without Borders.

2092
01:56:39,380 --> 01:56:40,740
It's about the speed runner.

2093
01:56:40,740 --> 01:56:43,180
It is not about Bobby Blackwolf or VOG Network.

2094
01:56:43,180 --> 01:56:47,220
So you're encouraged to go donate and give money and all that good stuff because it is

2095
01:56:47,220 --> 01:56:48,720
a great charity.

2096
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:53,980
But don't go there donating, going, ah, VOG Network, blah, Bobby Blackwolf, I love you,

2097
01:56:53,980 --> 01:56:56,660
that because he does not want the focus to be on him.

2098
01:56:56,660 --> 01:56:58,680
And in fact, it might actually kind of have a negative effect.

2099
01:56:58,680 --> 01:57:02,160
So it's really about the speed runner and charity.

2100
01:57:02,160 --> 01:57:05,840
So let's focus on those things and let's just be thrilled that we kind of like, you know,

2101
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:09,020
we already kind of knew somebody there because I know Jason's been volunteering for a little

2102
01:57:09,020 --> 01:57:12,420
while and now it's like, now we know somebody that will see like on the stream too.

2103
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:16,500
So that's really cool how more and more folks here at VOG Network are getting involved with

2104
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:17,500
that.

2105
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:21,380
So I will definitely try to check out that stream next Wednesday, so not this coming

2106
01:57:21,380 --> 01:57:24,260
Wednesday, but next Wednesday, and I think that's really cool.

2107
01:57:24,260 --> 01:57:25,260
So congrats, Bobby.

2108
01:57:25,260 --> 01:57:26,260
All right.

2109
01:57:26,260 --> 01:57:31,100
And congrats to Summer Games Done Quick for still doing a marathon, even in this whole

2110
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:36,180
pandemic situation and making the necessary adjustments to the virtual thing to do it.

2111
01:57:36,180 --> 01:57:39,180
And I still think they're going to raise a lot of money and it's going to be a great

2112
01:57:39,180 --> 01:57:42,900
thing, especially for an organization that could probably use it right now with a fucking

2113
01:57:42,900 --> 01:57:48,060
pandemic going on right now, because even though America might have this thing under

2114
01:57:48,060 --> 01:57:53,580
control by 2021 and some of the other, you know, big nations and so forth, there's going

2115
01:57:53,580 --> 01:57:57,420
to be a lot of countries on the planet that don't have this COVID thing worked out in

2116
01:57:57,420 --> 01:57:59,700
2021 yet.

2117
01:57:59,700 --> 01:58:04,060
And so, you know, an organization like Doctors Without Borders is going to be very instrumental

2118
01:58:04,060 --> 01:58:08,740
in making sure that COVID doesn't spread in other countries as well.

2119
01:58:08,740 --> 01:58:10,340
So very cool.

2120
01:58:10,340 --> 01:58:11,340
All right.

2121
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:12,340
Yeah.

2122
01:58:12,340 --> 01:58:13,420
And that's Joe and I'm out with a good tip.

2123
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:19,100
If you want to support Bobby, donate for the host announcer choice of donation incentive.

2124
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:23,900
So that's another thing you can do there is let him choose the donation incentive.

2125
01:58:23,900 --> 01:58:24,900
Okay.

2126
01:58:24,900 --> 01:58:25,900
That shout out being done.

2127
01:58:25,900 --> 01:58:28,500
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

2128
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:29,500
Loki.

2129
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:31,020
All right.

2130
01:58:31,020 --> 01:58:36,620
So in the U.S., we have a few games coming out, starting off with Hyper Scape on PC,

2131
01:58:36,620 --> 01:58:39,400
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2132
01:58:39,400 --> 01:58:45,240
We have Risk of Rain 2 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2133
01:58:45,240 --> 01:58:49,880
Caller Across Malice Unlimited on Nintendo Switch.

2134
01:58:49,880 --> 01:58:54,320
Total War Saga Troy on PC.

2135
01:58:54,320 --> 01:59:00,880
And then we have EA Sports UFC 4 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2136
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:02,600
That's it.

2137
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:05,040
All right.

2138
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:07,200
I'm slow in bringing up the Japanese releases.

2139
01:59:07,200 --> 01:59:10,160
Can we go out of order and do the U.K. next, Dark Sakura?

2140
01:59:10,160 --> 01:59:11,160
Sure.

2141
01:59:11,160 --> 01:59:13,280
It's only a handful on the 13th.

2142
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:16,240
We have UFC 4.

2143
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:18,600
We have Deliver Us the Moon.

2144
01:59:18,600 --> 01:59:23,160
And then there's also Beholder Collector's Edition for Switch.

2145
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:24,680
All right.

2146
01:59:24,680 --> 01:59:26,280
So not too much.

2147
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:27,280
Yeah.

2148
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:29,200
It's kind of a slower week in Japan as well.

2149
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:33,560
So looking at the releases over there on the Nintendo Switch, we have Ancestors Legacy

2150
01:59:33,560 --> 01:59:34,880
on August 11th.

2151
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:37,880
And that is the only release on the Switch.

2152
01:59:37,880 --> 01:59:46,400
Taking a look at the PlayStation 4, we have EA Sports UFC 4 gets a Japanese release on

2153
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:48,120
the 14th.

2154
01:59:48,120 --> 01:59:49,780
And otherwise, that's it.

2155
01:59:49,780 --> 01:59:51,880
It's a pretty slow week in Japan as well.

2156
01:59:51,880 --> 01:59:54,560
So there's your release dates around the world.

2157
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:56,480
Our next segment is the mailbag.

2158
01:59:56,480 --> 02:00:01,880
So every week we invite your emails at participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

2159
02:00:01,880 --> 02:00:04,360
And we read your emails here on the show.

2160
02:00:04,360 --> 02:00:10,320
However, my understanding is Dark Sakura, you went to the mailbag and it was empty.

2161
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:11,800
It was naked.

2162
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:13,000
It was born bare.

2163
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,300
It was born naked and the rest is drag.

2164
02:00:15,300 --> 02:00:17,400
So that means drag discussion, right?

2165
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:19,000
I started watching We Are Here.

2166
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Oh yeah?

2167
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,000
How's that?

2168
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Yeah.

2169
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,000
I only got through the first episode.

2170
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,040
I figured I'm going to not binge it.

2171
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:27,560
I'm just going to do like an episode here and there.

2172
02:00:27,560 --> 02:00:29,680
And oh my gosh, I had some sniffles.

2173
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:33,040
It was very beautiful and I love Changela even more.

2174
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:37,640
I haven't met Changela a couple of times who's just the sweetest person in person.

2175
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:41,160
And I'm really enjoying the show.

2176
02:00:41,160 --> 02:00:45,840
I didn't watch that, but I did watch Muppets Now on Disney Plus.

2177
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:48,160
And you might think, what does that have to do with drag queens?

2178
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:51,440
Well, RuPaul's in the first episode, for better or for worse.

2179
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:55,360
But also I would say that the original drag queen was Miss Piggy.

2180
02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:59,560
Yeah, I could go with that.

2181
02:00:59,560 --> 02:01:02,960
The Miss Piggy parts were the only parts where I was laughing out loud.

2182
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:06,200
Because I watched the first episode and there's a Miss Piggy segment, which is great.

2183
02:01:06,200 --> 02:01:08,500
And I was howling because Miss Piggy is hilarious.

2184
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:12,760
But then there was this whole Swedish chef thing where like the joke was old fast.

2185
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:16,100
And then the RuPaul thing was the joke was also old fast.

2186
02:01:16,100 --> 02:01:20,200
So I really hope the other episodes of Muppets Now are better than the first one or have

2187
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:22,960
more Miss Piggy, the original drag queen.

2188
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:23,960
Yeah.

2189
02:01:23,960 --> 02:01:24,960
All right.

2190
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:31,600
You know, it's funny, I've been also listening to a little bit more historical podcasts and

2191
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:39,200
talking followed, actually, if you like 60s and 70s drag personalities, it was actually

2192
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:47,120
kind of cool to learn more of the origins of drag and actually performers from the 1700s

2193
02:01:47,120 --> 02:01:50,080
that Oh, when Lady Bunny started, right?

2194
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:51,080
Oh, yeah.

2195
02:01:51,080 --> 02:01:52,080
No, no.

2196
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:54,800
Lady Bunny was well before that.

2197
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:57,920
Okay.

2198
02:01:57,920 --> 02:01:59,960
She was helping people by their sandals.

2199
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:00,960
I forgot.

2200
02:02:01,400 --> 02:02:02,520
The Roman government.

2201
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:04,440
She was she was the entertainment on the Mayflower.

2202
02:02:04,440 --> 02:02:05,440
I forgot.

2203
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:06,440
Yeah.

2204
02:02:06,440 --> 02:02:07,440
Rob.

2205
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:08,440
She was the meteor.

2206
02:02:08,440 --> 02:02:12,840
Anyway, Lady Bunny and Lady Bunny is also really fun to chat with.

2207
02:02:12,840 --> 02:02:13,840
I'm just going to throw that out there.

2208
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:15,840
I love Lady Bunny.

2209
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:19,520
And if you are not following Lady Bunny on the Facebooks and Twitters, get ready for

2210
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:21,320
a political ride.

2211
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:22,720
She is very astute.

2212
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:30,240
But at any rate, it's a I've been enjoying all this stuff, really getting a little bit

2213
02:02:30,240 --> 02:02:37,240
more in the like, I think learning from techniques now on things because I'm, you know, as a

2214
02:02:37,240 --> 02:02:40,800
sister, I think I can always grow because I mean, that's my drag.

2215
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:43,320
So that's it.

2216
02:02:43,320 --> 02:02:44,320
All right.

2217
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:46,680
Well, let's get back to video games.

2218
02:02:46,680 --> 02:02:47,800
Sorry, Loki.

2219
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:53,560
I know you were really enjoying this discussion, but maybe it was thrilling and I paid attention

2220
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:55,280
to zero.

2221
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:59,680
Maybe you have a video game related story to bring us back.

2222
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:06,400
Oh, by the way, participate at orange lounge radio dot com is the place to send us emails.

2223
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:11,160
So we can talk a little bit about the about Twitch and how the U.S. Army is coming back

2224
02:03:11,160 --> 02:03:12,160
to it as well.

2225
02:03:12,160 --> 02:03:19,840
May I remember we talked about a few weeks ago how they had been kind of blocked from

2226
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:27,240
Twitch because of some of the recruiting techniques that they were using, like, for example, posting

2227
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:33,280
fake giveaways and contests, pages like that, really, to try to get your contact information

2228
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:36,600
to contact you about your recruitment.

2229
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:42,880
Plus, they were banning people who were asking questions about different things that weren't

2230
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:52,520
necessarily abusive or, you know, for example, they were as certain individuals, I guess

2231
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:58,160
they're asking questions about war or whatnot, and they were being banned from that.

2232
02:03:58,160 --> 02:04:05,480
And since it's a government entity, it's technically illegal for them to be banning folks from

2233
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:09,560
being able to speak or comment on different things.

2234
02:04:09,560 --> 02:04:14,520
So now, of course, we have a comment from the U.S. Army Esports team, which is resisting

2235
02:04:14,520 --> 02:04:20,760
access for those accounts that previously banned for harassing or degrading behavior.

2236
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:25,800
The team is reviewing and clarifying its policies and procedures for the stream and provide

2237
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:29,960
all who have been banned the opportunity to participate in the space as long as they can

2238
02:04:29,960 --> 02:04:31,960
follow the team's guidelines.

2239
02:04:31,960 --> 02:04:38,040
Here, I'm going to give some free advice to the U.S. Army.

2240
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:39,040
You ready?

2241
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:42,680
Because I do this with a lot of Twitch channels that have big chat rooms.

2242
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:44,040
Just don't read the chat.

2243
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:48,280
Now, you might be thinking, Rob, this is the show where every gamer has a voice and you

2244
02:04:48,280 --> 02:04:49,640
read chat all the time.

2245
02:04:49,960 --> 02:04:52,680
We don't have 5,000 people watching this stream either.

2246
02:04:52,680 --> 02:04:56,840
And if we had that many people watching the stream, I would beg and ugly plead somebody

2247
02:04:56,840 --> 02:04:58,520
to help me screen chat comments.

2248
02:04:58,520 --> 02:04:59,160
Okay.

2249
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:02,680
Also, if you had 5,000 people in chat, you probably can't read the chat.

2250
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:03,800
Exactly.

2251
02:05:03,800 --> 02:05:04,600
Just be emojis.

2252
02:05:04,600 --> 02:05:05,080
Yeah.

2253
02:05:05,080 --> 02:05:08,520
So y'all have been very nice and well behaved in the chat room.

2254
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:12,680
We've only had like a couple incidents and Bobby Banhammer, Black Wolf and the rest of

2255
02:05:12,680 --> 02:05:15,400
our mods met it with swift justice, which is great.

2256
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:18,680
So y'all know I'm not talking about you.

2257
02:05:18,680 --> 02:05:24,120
I'm talking about those much larger chat rooms where it's just too much.

2258
02:05:24,120 --> 02:05:26,040
And it's impossible to read.

2259
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:29,000
So I would just encourage the Army, just stop reading chat.

2260
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,400
Just stop reading chat.

2261
02:05:31,960 --> 02:05:34,600
If it's gonna hurt your feelings that bad, don't read chat.

2262
02:05:36,040 --> 02:05:36,540
All right.

2263
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:37,820
Anyhow.

2264
02:05:39,320 --> 02:05:41,480
I guess great that they're back on Twitch.

2265
02:05:41,480 --> 02:05:43,000
I will not be watching.

2266
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:43,500
Okay.

2267
02:05:44,440 --> 02:05:45,320
I wasn't before.

2268
02:05:45,320 --> 02:05:47,560
And I just think it's still...

2269
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:53,080
Just somebody better be watching to make sure that they're not pulling the same garbage

2270
02:05:53,080 --> 02:05:53,400
again.

2271
02:05:53,400 --> 02:05:56,600
Not that there's really going to be any consequences for it, it sounds like.

2272
02:05:56,600 --> 02:05:57,640
So we'll see.

2273
02:05:58,200 --> 02:05:58,520
All right.

2274
02:05:59,080 --> 02:06:05,800
Well, moving on, let's talk about the Nintendo Switch and how it's selling a fucking ton

2275
02:06:05,800 --> 02:06:06,680
of them, basically.

2276
02:06:07,640 --> 02:06:11,560
Some new numbers from Nintendo's first quarter of their financial year.

2277
02:06:11,560 --> 02:06:18,040
So in the three-month window until June 30th, 2020, that'll be what, April 1st to June 30th,

2278
02:06:18,040 --> 02:06:23,880
2020, they sold 5.68 million Switch consoles in just those three months.

2279
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:28,040
No wonder you couldn't find one when house arrest began and this whole pandemic thing

2280
02:06:28,040 --> 02:06:28,840
going on.

2281
02:06:28,840 --> 02:06:33,560
This means that lifetime sales are at 61.44 million.

2282
02:06:33,560 --> 02:06:39,320
To put that in perspective, it is less than a half million behind the NES.

2283
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:46,600
The classic 8-bit NES that was in so many households that they now have Lego sets dedicated

2284
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:47,160
to.

2285
02:06:47,160 --> 02:06:49,560
That is how many Switches are out there.

2286
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:50,680
So that's a lot.

2287
02:06:51,240 --> 02:06:53,400
Something else to put in mind.

2288
02:06:53,960 --> 02:07:04,200
Animal Crossing New Horizons is now up to a lifetime sales figure of 22.4 million units.

2289
02:07:05,080 --> 02:07:10,840
To put that into perspective, it is the second best-selling game on the Switch, period.

2290
02:07:10,840 --> 02:07:12,120
You know what number one is?

2291
02:07:12,120 --> 02:07:15,400
Anyone want to guess that doesn't know the answer already?

2292
02:07:15,400 --> 02:07:16,520
What's the number one game?

2293
02:07:16,520 --> 02:07:17,640
Darsaka, any thoughts?

2294
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:19,880
I'll give you a hint.

2295
02:07:19,880 --> 02:07:21,400
It's had more time to sell.

2296
02:07:22,520 --> 02:07:23,560
Oh, Breath of the Wild.

2297
02:07:24,200 --> 02:07:26,120
Very good guess, but that's actually like number five.

2298
02:07:27,400 --> 02:07:29,080
Another good guess, but it's not in there.

2299
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:33,000
The top-selling game is Mario Kart.

2300
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:33,400
You got it.

2301
02:07:33,480 --> 02:07:38,280
It's Mario Kart 8, and it's not that much ahead.

2302
02:07:38,280 --> 02:07:45,560
So it seems almost likely that Animal Crossing will overtake it to become the biggest Nintendo

2303
02:07:45,560 --> 02:07:46,680
Switch game.

2304
02:07:46,680 --> 02:07:49,240
And that is huge for this franchise.

2305
02:07:49,880 --> 02:07:55,640
Animal Crossing is officially bigger than Mario or Zelda.

2306
02:07:56,200 --> 02:07:57,240
Stu on that for a minute.

2307
02:07:58,920 --> 02:08:03,160
Not yet, technically, because Mario Kart is still number one, but probably this time in

2308
02:08:03,160 --> 02:08:07,240
a few months, Animal Crossing is Nintendo's biggest franchise.

2309
02:08:07,240 --> 02:08:08,200
Something to think about.

2310
02:08:09,640 --> 02:08:12,360
Again, certainly the pandemic has probably played into that as well.

2311
02:08:13,640 --> 02:08:18,440
Orangewright says, I'm surprised they haven't made DLC to cash in on Mario Kart 8's deluxe

2312
02:08:18,440 --> 02:08:19,160
success.

2313
02:08:19,160 --> 02:08:23,240
Why would they do that when they're hard at work on Mario Kart 9 if the rumors are to

2314
02:08:23,240 --> 02:08:26,040
be believed or the captain obvious is to be believed?

2315
02:08:26,040 --> 02:08:27,480
Of course, they're going to make a Mario Kart 9.

2316
02:08:28,440 --> 02:08:31,080
Yeah, well, they did DLC already.

2317
02:08:31,080 --> 02:08:32,600
They did two pieces of DLC.

2318
02:08:33,320 --> 02:08:38,760
The only question really is, what's going to be like the twist in Mario Kart 9?

2319
02:08:38,760 --> 02:08:39,720
What are they going to do differently?

2320
02:08:39,720 --> 02:08:42,120
Because Mario Kart 8 will be exactly the same.

2321
02:08:42,120 --> 02:08:43,480
Just more Mario Kart.

2322
02:08:43,480 --> 02:08:44,360
Probably.

2323
02:08:44,360 --> 02:08:46,040
But is that a bad thing?

2324
02:08:46,040 --> 02:08:46,840
I don't think so.

2325
02:08:46,840 --> 02:08:50,760
No, maybe they'll have more characters since Animal Crossing is going to be their number

2326
02:08:50,760 --> 02:08:52,040
one selling franchise.

2327
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:53,960
They can have Animal Crossing characters in there.

2328
02:08:54,920 --> 02:08:58,040
Which is, Isabel was already in the last one, but yes.

2329
02:08:58,040 --> 02:08:59,880
Well, more Animal Crossing characters.

2330
02:08:59,880 --> 02:09:03,560
Well, yeah, because the Animal Crossing village was the second DLC pack.

2331
02:09:03,560 --> 02:09:05,080
The first pack was the Zelda one.

2332
02:09:05,080 --> 02:09:06,920
The second pack was the Animal Crossing one.

2333
02:09:06,920 --> 02:09:08,200
So something to think about.

2334
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:15,160
So, yeah, Nintendo also teasing at the announcements that Paper Mario the Origami King had just

2335
02:09:15,160 --> 02:09:15,560
come out.

2336
02:09:16,120 --> 02:09:17,800
They talked about the Pikmin remaster.

2337
02:09:18,360 --> 02:09:22,200
So it looks like Nintendo will probably have another really good quarter this quarter as

2338
02:09:22,200 --> 02:09:28,040
well, especially with this pandemic continuing on and more people are escaping to Animal

2339
02:09:28,040 --> 02:09:30,920
Crossing, which I never even talked about.

2340
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:33,080
I never even talked about Animal Crossing during my gaming week.

2341
02:09:33,080 --> 02:09:37,560
I'm getting so frustrated that I'm not getting more pictures from villagers.

2342
02:09:37,560 --> 02:09:41,480
I'm giving every single one of them gifts every damn day.

2343
02:09:41,480 --> 02:09:45,560
And I still don't have anybody's picture, but catch up, which she's the most important.

2344
02:09:45,560 --> 02:09:48,600
But still, Rob, what do you want to know what happened?

2345
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:49,800
What you want to know who left?

2346
02:09:50,840 --> 02:09:51,400
Oh, who?

2347
02:09:52,440 --> 02:09:53,320
Dina.

2348
02:09:53,320 --> 02:09:54,120
Oh, that's sad.

2349
02:09:55,080 --> 02:09:58,600
Well, I mean, and I've got a card to give you of her anyway, so you can have her.

2350
02:09:58,600 --> 02:10:01,160
But but I waited too long to replace her.

2351
02:10:01,160 --> 02:10:06,040
And now I'm getting Graham, who is this derpy looking little hamster.

2352
02:10:06,040 --> 02:10:07,480
And Dan is excited about it.

2353
02:10:07,480 --> 02:10:09,240
But now I need another female character.

2354
02:10:09,240 --> 02:10:13,000
So Octavian is getting the boot because I have his picture.

2355
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:16,600
Yeah, I think I told you, I guess this happened last week.

2356
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:20,920
I lost Joey, the duck that never wore pants like Donald Duck.

2357
02:10:20,920 --> 02:10:25,560
And I got Boots is my newest one, who's like a jock alligator.

2358
02:10:27,400 --> 02:10:27,720
Yeah.

2359
02:10:27,720 --> 02:10:32,360
And the funny thing is, his birth, he showed up on my island like August 2nd.

2360
02:10:32,360 --> 02:10:33,960
His birthday was August 7th.

2361
02:10:35,080 --> 02:10:37,240
So I was like, am I even going to be able to give him a gift?

2362
02:10:37,240 --> 02:10:37,720
Am I going to be?

2363
02:10:37,720 --> 02:10:39,000
But I was able to give him a gift.

2364
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,560
If you talked to him for two days, then yeah, you can give him a gift.

2365
02:10:41,560 --> 02:10:42,040
OK, good.

2366
02:10:42,040 --> 02:10:42,520
Yeah.

2367
02:10:42,520 --> 02:10:46,520
So I gave him I gave him one of those iron door things.

2368
02:10:46,520 --> 02:10:47,880
And so he put that out on his house.

2369
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:51,720
And I even customized it to green because he's an alligator and he's green.

2370
02:10:51,720 --> 02:10:53,000
So I thought he'd like that.

2371
02:10:53,800 --> 02:10:57,240
Well, I'm going to I'm going to probably I don't know.

2372
02:10:57,240 --> 02:10:59,720
Well, you know who I'm going to replace Octavian with?

2373
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:00,280
His Anka.

2374
02:11:01,800 --> 02:11:05,800
Because I have a card for Anka.

2375
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:09,480
So and then I will eventually go back on my hunt for Adi.

2376
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:09,880
We'll see.

2377
02:11:10,840 --> 02:11:12,920
Dark Tetsuya says I'm trying to get Boomer.

2378
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:15,480
I just had a spot open up, but I haven't found him yet.

2379
02:11:15,480 --> 02:11:16,200
Boomer lives.

2380
02:11:16,200 --> 02:11:17,880
I have Boomer, actually.

2381
02:11:17,880 --> 02:11:20,120
He's my only now since Joey left.

2382
02:11:20,120 --> 02:11:21,720
He's my only lazy type.

2383
02:11:21,720 --> 02:11:24,440
If he ever offers to leave dark Tetsuya, I'll let you know.

2384
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:27,000
Although it would have to time up just right.

2385
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,720
Like he's got to be in boxes the same day you have an empty house.

2386
02:11:29,720 --> 02:11:31,000
So it doesn't always work out.

2387
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,400
But I'll let you know if Boomer ever leaves.

2388
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:39,560
So I am I am never getting rid of of Zucker, who is my lazy special child.

2389
02:11:39,560 --> 02:11:39,880
Yeah.

2390
02:11:39,880 --> 02:11:41,320
Talks to the bugs in his floor.

2391
02:11:41,320 --> 02:11:43,240
I won't let him turn my gown.

2392
02:11:43,240 --> 02:11:44,760
Yeah, I won't like ketchup ever leave.

2393
02:11:45,560 --> 02:11:49,640
Well, Zucker loves his bug, so I gave him a termite now so he can have his bugs 24 seven.

2394
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:50,440
That's like Boomer.

2395
02:11:50,440 --> 02:11:53,160
He's like obsessed with bugs and taking it easy.

2396
02:11:53,160 --> 02:11:55,400
It's all that you know, it's funny.

2397
02:11:55,400 --> 02:12:00,040
And Dan and I were saying this that even though these are like set personality types,

2398
02:12:00,040 --> 02:12:02,200
they have the same dialog, you know, et cetera.

2399
02:12:02,840 --> 02:12:07,960
It's like looking at their little body types and who they are adds a different

2400
02:12:07,960 --> 02:12:09,480
air of personality to them.

2401
02:12:10,040 --> 02:12:12,760
Like we were talking about how Rosie and Apple.

2402
02:12:12,760 --> 02:12:17,160
OK, Apple's, you know, little squishy hamster, annoying pink thing.

2403
02:12:17,160 --> 02:12:18,360
And Rosie is a cat.

2404
02:12:18,360 --> 02:12:20,120
You know, she's one of the classic ones.

2405
02:12:20,120 --> 02:12:21,000
Everyone knows Rosie.

2406
02:12:22,120 --> 02:12:25,560
But we were like, Rosie's just like Dan's like, yeah, Rosie's kind of full of herself.

2407
02:12:25,560 --> 02:12:27,320
And, you know, she's like the idol girl.

2408
02:12:27,320 --> 02:12:30,840
And while Apple had the same personality, she was so much the wannabe.

2409
02:12:30,840 --> 02:12:31,340
Yeah.

2410
02:12:31,880 --> 02:12:37,080
You know, or like with your characters, like we have Dom and he's a jock, you know, sheep.

2411
02:12:37,080 --> 02:12:38,920
And he's this fluffy little guy.

2412
02:12:38,920 --> 02:12:40,120
Like where's all this muscles?

2413
02:12:40,120 --> 02:12:40,920
He's a fluffy guy.

2414
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:43,960
So and let me ask this question of D'Artitsio.

2415
02:12:43,960 --> 02:12:45,160
Why not cube?

2416
02:12:45,160 --> 02:12:47,400
If you want a penguin cube still in the game, right?

2417
02:12:47,400 --> 02:12:51,800
He was like, he was the most desirable villager in the original game because it was like cube

2418
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:53,400
on the GameCube and it's a penguin.

2419
02:12:53,400 --> 02:12:53,900
Cool.

2420
02:12:54,440 --> 02:12:56,040
Although I have a card for cube.

2421
02:12:56,040 --> 02:12:59,960
I'm not one to criticize choices and villagers like, you know, you like who you like.

2422
02:12:59,960 --> 02:13:04,040
So but I'm just I'm I would there's people I will judge for.

2423
02:13:05,240 --> 02:13:08,280
There's ones I will judge for who I want to know.

2424
02:13:08,840 --> 02:13:11,880
I still want Antonio, though, because Antonio is cool.

2425
02:13:11,880 --> 02:13:13,080
Antonio's on Allen's Island.

2426
02:13:16,920 --> 02:13:22,360
But at any rate, there are some that just like really like I'll be honest,

2427
02:13:22,360 --> 02:13:24,520
that pink gorilla one, what was her name?

2428
02:13:24,520 --> 02:13:25,400
Oh, Rocket.

2429
02:13:25,400 --> 02:13:26,280
I liked her.

2430
02:13:26,280 --> 02:13:27,240
I don't like Rocket.

2431
02:13:29,240 --> 02:13:31,000
I honestly don't like any of the gorillas.

2432
02:13:31,640 --> 02:13:32,440
Whatever.

2433
02:13:32,440 --> 02:13:33,000
All right.

2434
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:34,440
We should probably move on to the next story.

2435
02:13:34,440 --> 02:13:35,080
Sorry, Jamie.

2436
02:13:35,800 --> 02:13:39,400
We see an Animal Crossing like two hour chat every week.

2437
02:13:40,040 --> 02:13:44,840
New podcast, Animal Crossing all the time or a special live stream on VOG or something.

2438
02:13:44,840 --> 02:13:46,200
Animal Crossing all day, every day.

2439
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:48,680
Come over to one of our towns.

2440
02:13:48,680 --> 02:13:51,720
Don't tell me I'll do a random Animal Crossing stream on VOG.

2441
02:13:51,720 --> 02:13:53,560
I'll do it if you're willing to join me on Discord.

2442
02:13:53,560 --> 02:13:53,960
Let's do it.

2443
02:13:53,960 --> 02:13:54,680
Let's do it this week.

2444
02:13:54,680 --> 02:13:57,320
We'll talk if it's if it's a day that I can.

2445
02:13:57,320 --> 02:13:57,720
Sure.

2446
02:13:57,720 --> 02:13:58,520
Yeah, we'll talk.

2447
02:13:58,520 --> 02:13:59,000
Yeah.

2448
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:00,120
OK, no big whoop.

2449
02:14:01,160 --> 02:14:01,960
No big deal.

2450
02:14:01,960 --> 02:14:03,320
So is it me?

2451
02:14:03,320 --> 02:14:03,820
Yep.

2452
02:14:04,780 --> 02:14:05,340
It's me.

2453
02:14:05,900 --> 02:14:06,940
What do I get to do?

2454
02:14:08,220 --> 02:14:12,140
So, you know, I have been saying I like GamerX to come back.

2455
02:14:12,140 --> 02:14:15,100
I love all the fun, you know, gaming events.

2456
02:14:15,100 --> 02:14:17,580
G-A-Y-M-I-N-G.

2457
02:14:17,580 --> 02:14:22,780
Well, there is a British media outlet called Gaming Magazine that has announced it will

2458
02:14:22,780 --> 02:14:30,940
be holding its first gaming awards ceremony in 2021 that offers recognition to community

2459
02:14:30,940 --> 02:14:35,740
streamers, games, companies that, quote, offer positive and inclusive support in the

2460
02:14:35,740 --> 02:14:38,140
representation of LGBTQ community.

2461
02:14:39,260 --> 02:14:41,020
Don't forget the A. The A is important.

2462
02:14:41,020 --> 02:14:41,580
I am the A.

2463
02:14:42,540 --> 02:14:50,300
And anyway, they have a global panel of over 20 judges in the community who will, you know,

2464
02:14:50,300 --> 02:14:58,700
go through the nominees and go through and offer nominees based on these criteria.

2465
02:14:58,700 --> 02:15:04,220
So we have the Game of the Year category categories, Game of the Year, Authentic Representation

2466
02:15:04,220 --> 02:15:11,180
Award, Best LGBTQ Character, Narrative, Indie Game, Streamer, Industry Diversity Award,

2467
02:15:11,180 --> 02:15:14,380
Special Recognition Award, and Gaming Magazine's Reader Award.

2468
02:15:15,100 --> 02:15:17,180
So, yeah, stay posted.

2469
02:15:17,180 --> 02:15:18,220
Keep a lookout for it.

2470
02:15:18,220 --> 02:15:22,060
And for those in the chat, I'll link the tweet to it.

2471
02:15:22,700 --> 02:15:26,460
So if anyone wants to follow this, there you go.

2472
02:15:26,460 --> 02:15:28,620
But look up Gaming Magazine.

2473
02:15:29,740 --> 02:15:32,220
Their handle is at GamingMag.

2474
02:15:32,220 --> 02:15:34,220
G-A-Y-M-I-N-G-M-A-G.

2475
02:15:35,900 --> 02:15:36,400
All right.

2476
02:15:37,020 --> 02:15:37,260
Yeah.

2477
02:15:37,260 --> 02:15:43,180
I mean, obviously, as a gay guy who plays video games, I'm excited to see something

2478
02:15:43,180 --> 02:15:43,900
like this.

2479
02:15:43,900 --> 02:15:46,380
It does kind of seem like it kind of came out of the blue.

2480
02:15:46,380 --> 02:15:49,740
Like this magazine just decided, hey, let's throw this event.

2481
02:15:49,740 --> 02:15:51,420
And maybe people will show up.

2482
02:15:51,420 --> 02:15:53,500
But I guess that's how all good ideas start, right?

2483
02:15:54,940 --> 02:15:55,820
I think it's a good thing.

2484
02:15:55,820 --> 02:15:57,100
We definitely need more of it.

2485
02:15:57,100 --> 02:15:57,600
Yeah.

2486
02:15:58,380 --> 02:15:59,180
We'll see what happens.

2487
02:16:00,140 --> 02:16:01,420
I'll check it out online.

2488
02:16:01,420 --> 02:16:06,140
I mean, I ain't gonna be able to fly to London, not in February 2021, and check it out in

2489
02:16:06,140 --> 02:16:06,540
person.

2490
02:16:06,540 --> 02:16:09,020
But I'll probably still be banned from the UK then.

2491
02:16:09,020 --> 02:16:10,780
But I'll definitely check it out online.

2492
02:16:10,780 --> 02:16:12,060
So there's that.

2493
02:16:13,020 --> 02:16:13,580
All right.

2494
02:16:13,580 --> 02:16:17,260
A few more stories for you guys before we get to taking your questions in the listener

2495
02:16:17,260 --> 02:16:18,860
roundtable in our chat room.

2496
02:16:18,860 --> 02:16:19,660
Loki, what do you have?

2497
02:16:20,460 --> 02:16:20,960
All right.

2498
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:30,400
So the World of Warcraft is getting a tribute for one of the Twitch streamers, Reckful.

2499
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:34,800
So they're going to be honoring him.

2500
02:16:34,800 --> 02:16:37,920
He died apparently last month from suicide.

2501
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:38,240
Yeah.

2502
02:16:38,240 --> 02:16:45,520
And so with that, they're going to give him a MPC that's going to be located in the Cathedral

2503
02:16:45,520 --> 02:16:47,120
of Light in the Shadowlands.

2504
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:48,960
So that's pretty cool.

2505
02:16:48,960 --> 02:16:52,160
I like how they do these kind of tributes and stuff for these players.

2506
02:16:53,520 --> 02:16:56,000
So yeah, it's nice.

2507
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:04,720
And then apparently if there's, I guess you can, you know, I guess say hi to it and stuff.

2508
02:17:04,720 --> 02:17:11,840
And then basically he'll say, I don't train assassin or assassination rogues.

2509
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:18,160
I guess it's a reference to his time in the top of the PvP ladder, it says.

2510
02:17:18,160 --> 02:17:19,440
So interesting.

2511
02:17:19,440 --> 02:17:23,920
Yeah, he was trying to prove a point that because assassination was like the big thing

2512
02:17:23,920 --> 02:17:26,080
at the time, it was like one of the strongest builds.

2513
02:17:26,080 --> 02:17:29,040
He was proving that you could do PvP without the assassination build.

2514
02:17:29,760 --> 02:17:32,640
And I think something that was important to remember about Reckful, though, I mean, I

2515
02:17:32,640 --> 02:17:37,440
can't claim to have watched his streams all the time, but my understanding is he was not

2516
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:41,680
just a popular and large World of Warcraft streamer on Twitch.

2517
02:17:41,680 --> 02:17:44,480
He was an early World of Warcraft streamer on Twitch.

2518
02:17:44,480 --> 02:17:49,040
So one might even argue, like, you know, helped to shape the streaming community on

2519
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:50,480
Twitch to what it is today.

2520
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:55,440
So I'm sure there's lots of players who are very happy to hear this and pay tribute.

2521
02:17:55,440 --> 02:18:00,800
And yeah, you've mentioned sometimes folks who have left us in the real world do get

2522
02:18:00,800 --> 02:18:03,280
some sort of memorialization of World of Warcraft.

2523
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:04,800
I can think of another one off the top of my head.

2524
02:18:04,800 --> 02:18:09,440
I know in a Horde house back in the day when I still had that side podcast about World

2525
02:18:09,440 --> 02:18:15,440
of Warcraft, we talked to somebody whose husband had been memorialized in the Wrath

2526
02:18:15,440 --> 02:18:16,320
of Pandaria.

2527
02:18:17,440 --> 02:18:21,440
No, and there was Mists of Pandaria in the Mists of Pandaria expansion.

2528
02:18:21,440 --> 02:18:24,560
So there was also, like, was it like the Dwarven statue?

2529
02:18:24,560 --> 02:18:25,920
Yeah, there were a few developers.

2530
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:27,840
There was the Dwarven statue.

2531
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:31,760
And then there's, you know, people still with us, you know, that have been turned into it

2532
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:35,200
like Leroy Jenkins is an achievement that I don't think you can get anymore.

2533
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:37,360
But I got it.

2534
02:18:38,160 --> 02:18:44,080
But, you know, there's so I really that's one thing that I've always given them, even

2535
02:18:44,080 --> 02:18:50,240
if I'm not going to be playing anymore, how they've at least had this bond with the

2536
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:51,040
community.

2537
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:55,680
Or as Act Dev says in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, Act Dev says shows us again

2538
02:18:55,680 --> 02:18:58,320
that the actual devs at Blizzard do give a crap.

2539
02:18:58,320 --> 02:19:01,440
So, you know, despite all those other things we were talking about, you know, early in

2540
02:19:01,440 --> 02:19:05,920
the show, which again, that has to do with mismanagement and people at the higher level

2541
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:09,760
and the Bobby Kotex who are money hungry and all this stuff and and the people that

2542
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:14,640
are actually in there doing the work on the front lines like are very kind and, you know,

2543
02:19:14,640 --> 02:19:17,360
we'll do these types of things for important community members.

2544
02:19:17,360 --> 02:19:18,400
I think it's really cool.

2545
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:22,320
Like I, you know, again, I don't like to talk about my own mortality, but I think I've

2546
02:19:22,320 --> 02:19:24,800
even said this, like just a couple weeks ago on the show.

2547
02:19:25,440 --> 02:19:27,760
If anything, heaven forbid should ever happen to me.

2548
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:34,800
I would I would be so hopeful I would be memorialized as a pokestop or something in these games,

2549
02:19:34,800 --> 02:19:38,080
you know, some of the games that I've loved over the years.

2550
02:19:38,080 --> 02:19:41,600
Final Fantasy 14 would be amazing or Warcraft.

2551
02:19:41,600 --> 02:19:45,200
I loved Warcraft for many years, you know, so anyhow.

2552
02:19:46,320 --> 02:19:46,640
All right.

2553
02:19:46,640 --> 02:19:55,120
Well, moving on to a game that is very old, but in many ways hasn't aged and has really

2554
02:19:55,120 --> 02:20:04,240
shown us many other types of first person shooters since Quake and Quake Con 2020 happened

2555
02:20:04,240 --> 02:20:06,080
this weekend, although, of course, it was all online.

2556
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:07,440
It was a virtual convention.

2557
02:20:07,440 --> 02:20:13,600
But part of the virtual convention was that you can get the original Quake for free and

2558
02:20:13,600 --> 02:20:16,640
it's something that you can actually play on a newer PC.

2559
02:20:16,640 --> 02:20:18,800
It has to be done through the Bethesda launcher.

2560
02:20:18,800 --> 02:20:22,320
So ain't nothing really free in this world because you got to put that on your computer.

2561
02:20:22,960 --> 02:20:27,600
But it is I actually checked it out myself and downloaded it because I had the Bethesda

2562
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:28,800
launcher anyway for something else.

2563
02:20:29,520 --> 02:20:32,800
So, yeah, it's it's cool to get to play the OG Quake again.

2564
02:20:32,800 --> 02:20:35,200
I don't know how mod support works or any of that stuff.

2565
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:40,160
I don't know if it's easy to put in Team Fortress or whatever, but I know it's there.

2566
02:20:40,800 --> 02:20:47,760
And they are saying Quake 2 is supposed to be following very soon now.

2567
02:20:47,760 --> 02:20:49,280
And Quake 3 also.

2568
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:51,280
Oh, Quake 3 is the best one.

2569
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:51,760
I hope so.

2570
02:20:51,760 --> 02:20:56,400
Quake 3 is also supposed to be free as well after apparently it says we'll be free in

2571
02:20:56,400 --> 02:21:01,360
Bethesda net launcher after Quake Con if you logged in during Quake Con.

2572
02:21:01,360 --> 02:21:02,640
Now, it's not.

2573
02:21:02,640 --> 02:21:07,520
Yeah, I was just gonna say, because no one special in chat says I just looked at Bethesda's

2574
02:21:07,520 --> 02:21:10,800
launcher store and Quake is a dollar fifty, not free.

2575
02:21:10,800 --> 02:21:14,160
So it might have just run out by the time we were on air.

2576
02:21:14,160 --> 02:21:17,680
So sorry, I guess I should say Quake was free this weekend.

2577
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:18,400
Womp, womp.

2578
02:21:18,400 --> 02:21:22,720
But do keep a lookout for Quake 2 and 3 because, again, I didn't care for Quake 2 as much,

2579
02:21:22,720 --> 02:21:24,720
but Quake 3 I thought was a really strong game.

2580
02:21:26,480 --> 02:21:29,760
Yeah, and that'll still be through the launcher as well, of course.

2581
02:21:30,480 --> 02:21:31,280
Nice.

2582
02:21:31,280 --> 02:21:33,520
Oh, yeah, they got their $10,000 donations.

2583
02:21:33,520 --> 02:21:34,000
That's cool.

2584
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:34,500
Great.

2585
02:21:35,120 --> 02:21:35,680
All right.

2586
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:38,800
Well, that is it for the topics that we had planned out tonight.

2587
02:21:38,800 --> 02:21:42,080
But if you have something you want to bring up, you can do that in our chat room over

2588
02:21:42,080 --> 02:21:44,080
twitch.tv slash vog network.

2589
02:21:44,080 --> 02:21:47,040
Maybe there's something we haven't discussed tonight or you want to get our opinion on

2590
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:48,160
that we haven't talked about yet.

2591
02:21:48,720 --> 02:21:51,600
In the meantime, I will turn to Loki and see if there's any last minute stories.

2592
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:57,280
No, because you took my one in the very beginning about the controllers leaking.

2593
02:21:57,280 --> 02:21:57,920
Oh, my bad.

2594
02:21:58,640 --> 02:22:01,920
Aside from that, there is absolutely nothing else to talk about.

2595
02:22:02,480 --> 02:22:04,880
Yeah, I have to be honest.

2596
02:22:04,880 --> 02:22:07,680
I had to really dig to fill out the show tonight.

2597
02:22:07,680 --> 02:22:08,800
I think we had a bunch of...

2598
02:22:08,800 --> 02:22:11,600
They were all good stories, but it was just enough.

2599
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:17,520
But if we're wrong, if you guys have an additional thing you want to talk about, please, by all

2600
02:22:17,520 --> 02:22:18,640
means, speak up and chat.

2601
02:22:18,640 --> 02:22:21,280
We do have a chat from no one special in our chat.

2602
02:22:21,280 --> 02:22:22,640
It says round table question.

2603
02:22:23,200 --> 02:22:24,800
Okay, so most of us...

2604
02:22:24,800 --> 02:22:27,280
And by the way, for the podcast listeners who aren't here live,

2605
02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:30,960
the name in chat really is no one special 77.

2606
02:22:30,960 --> 02:22:34,080
I'm not being like, oh, they're nobody special.

2607
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:36,160
That's actually their nickname, just so we're clear.

2608
02:22:36,160 --> 02:22:37,760
I'm not a total asshole, just partial.

2609
02:22:38,400 --> 02:22:40,320
No one special asks round table question.

2610
02:22:40,320 --> 02:22:46,000
Okay, so most of us, if not all of us, love retro games and retro collections, and they're

2611
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,160
semi-popular on services like Steam.

2612
02:22:48,880 --> 02:22:55,200
That being said, if you could have any game from the 1990s re-released for Steam, what

2613
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:56,880
would it be and why?

2614
02:22:57,600 --> 02:23:03,040
Ooh, see, now it's the 90s, so I can't go to my go-to guardian legend answer from 1988

2615
02:23:03,040 --> 02:23:04,880
or 87, whenever that was out.

2616
02:23:04,880 --> 02:23:06,560
So what do we do from the 90s, gang?

2617
02:23:07,120 --> 02:23:09,360
What game would you like to see re-released from Steam?

2618
02:23:13,360 --> 02:23:14,320
Virtua racing.

2619
02:23:17,920 --> 02:23:19,040
When did Rival Schools come out?

2620
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:27,360
Um, I might say, you know, uh, and I talk about this game frequently as an old favorite

2621
02:23:27,360 --> 02:23:28,640
on the 1997.

2622
02:23:28,640 --> 02:23:29,200
It counts.

2623
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:29,600
Okay.

2624
02:23:30,480 --> 02:23:33,760
On the NES and Super Nintendo, there was a series.

2625
02:23:33,760 --> 02:23:38,480
There was a, it was a Solstice on the NES and it was Equinox on the Super Nintendo.

2626
02:23:38,480 --> 02:23:40,000
And I think a lot of people knew Solstice.

2627
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:45,520
I don't think hardly anybody knew Equinox, but it was that rare Sony Imagine Soft game

2628
02:23:45,520 --> 02:23:48,400
on the Super Nintendo, because this is before Sony had their own thing.

2629
02:23:49,280 --> 02:23:50,800
And I loved Equinox.

2630
02:23:50,800 --> 02:23:51,680
I love the music.

2631
02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:53,680
I love the type of game it was.

2632
02:23:53,680 --> 02:23:57,840
And there's games that I guess that are kind of like it, but I would love to have like

2633
02:23:57,840 --> 02:24:05,680
an official release of those type of games, uh, kind of come back on, um, um, Steam.

2634
02:24:06,400 --> 02:24:11,760
Um, or I guess if I could, if you wanted to go way back to PC stuff, I mean, think about

2635
02:24:11,760 --> 02:24:15,120
some of the games I've talked about as classic game of the week previously on the show.

2636
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:18,960
And you probably got to go way back, but there was a game I used to love to play in

2637
02:24:18,960 --> 02:24:22,000
the nineties, uh, that was over a modem.

2638
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:23,680
It was called Lexi Cross.

2639
02:24:23,680 --> 02:24:27,280
And I know I've done this as a classic game of the week, but it was like a game show that

2640
02:24:27,280 --> 02:24:28,560
was like a word puzzle.

2641
02:24:28,560 --> 02:24:32,400
It was like a wheel of fortune mixed with like a crossword puzzle type of thing.

2642
02:24:32,400 --> 02:24:36,240
Uh, and you could play over the modem and actually play against somebody else.

2643
02:24:36,240 --> 02:24:37,840
I thought that game was tons of fun.

2644
02:24:37,840 --> 02:24:38,640
So I love that.

2645
02:24:39,520 --> 02:24:44,160
So, um, I would say, uh, point blank.

2646
02:24:45,440 --> 02:24:47,200
Oh, that's a good one.

2647
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:54,960
You know, our buddy Y Y R released a really good point blank inspired game called sharpshooter

2648
02:24:54,960 --> 02:24:56,240
available on Steam.

2649
02:24:56,240 --> 02:24:57,280
Cheap plug, cheap plug.

2650
02:24:58,160 --> 02:24:58,800
So there's that.

2651
02:24:59,840 --> 02:25:00,160
Yeah.

2652
02:25:00,160 --> 02:25:03,600
I see that there was a point blank DS game, which I completely forgot about.

2653
02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:05,120
I forgot about that too.

2654
02:25:05,120 --> 02:25:10,160
Um, a thing, but yeah, I would like to see a new point blank would be pretty cool.

2655
02:25:10,160 --> 02:25:10,960
Yeah.

2656
02:25:10,960 --> 02:25:15,520
Uh, let's see pixel pockets and chat says freelance writers for the popular visual novel

2657
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:16,080
collection.

2658
02:25:16,080 --> 02:25:20,480
Love struck one, a significant pay increase from their publisher voltage.

2659
02:25:20,480 --> 02:25:25,200
They had a strike for 21 days because they were being paid under market rates.

2660
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:29,840
See what I tell you earlier in the show, this is, this is the beginning, like this bubble

2661
02:25:29,840 --> 02:25:35,120
on the whole, like unions and, and folks that, you know, again, and I, as I said earlier

2662
02:25:35,120 --> 02:25:38,560
in the show, folks that are taken advantage of because.

2663
02:25:40,240 --> 02:25:44,640
Higher ups know that there's so many people that are enthusiastic and wanting to get into

2664
02:25:44,640 --> 02:25:45,440
the industry.

2665
02:25:45,440 --> 02:25:50,160
Like the bubble's going to burst on that very soon because honestly you have so many people

2666
02:25:50,160 --> 02:25:53,600
now that are just like, you know what, if this is the way I'm going to get treated,

2667
02:25:53,600 --> 02:25:54,000
fuck it.

2668
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:55,120
I'm going to make an indie game.

2669
02:25:55,120 --> 02:25:56,960
I'm going to make my own game studio.

2670
02:25:56,960 --> 02:26:02,640
I'm going to make the next fall guys and be, you know, a huge, successful success.

2671
02:26:03,440 --> 02:26:08,160
So apparently doing a quick Google search for point blank, apparently gun bullet X is

2672
02:26:08,160 --> 02:26:13,440
a thing, which is a brand new point blank game that came out in 2017 arcades and it's

2673
02:26:13,440 --> 02:26:14,560
all in HD and stuff.

2674
02:26:14,560 --> 02:26:17,280
So I guess we already got that.

2675
02:26:17,280 --> 02:26:21,200
I'd still like it on steam, but you know, at least it's a thing.

2676
02:26:22,400 --> 02:26:26,880
Dr. Tzuyu in chat says it's not nineties, but I wish Capcom would release their early

2677
02:26:26,880 --> 02:26:29,520
eighties arcade stuff on steam and switch.

2678
02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:32,960
They had a pretty decent arcade collection on the PlayStation three.

2679
02:26:32,960 --> 02:26:34,320
It was in like five parts.

2680
02:26:35,200 --> 02:26:39,520
And I don't know why they haven't gone back to that because, you know, Sega goes back

2681
02:26:39,520 --> 02:26:40,400
to that.

2682
02:26:40,400 --> 02:26:45,360
Every generation there's some fucking Genesis collection that'll come out, you know, that

2683
02:26:45,360 --> 02:26:46,640
was something new or whatever.

2684
02:26:47,440 --> 02:26:50,720
And some of the, like the Sega ages stuff is pretty great.

2685
02:26:50,720 --> 02:26:53,680
I wish they would compile all of those on a one disc and release that.

2686
02:26:54,320 --> 02:26:56,800
And speaking of Capcom, how about Powerstone?

2687
02:26:56,800 --> 02:26:58,400
Can we get some more Powerstone please?

2688
02:26:58,400 --> 02:26:58,800
Yes.

2689
02:26:58,800 --> 02:26:59,520
Good call.

2690
02:26:59,520 --> 02:27:00,720
Powerstone.

2691
02:27:00,720 --> 02:27:02,240
I'm all for that on the switch.

2692
02:27:02,240 --> 02:27:03,440
Let's bring that back.

2693
02:27:03,440 --> 02:27:03,920
Yep.

2694
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:05,440
I think that's one we can all agree on.

2695
02:27:05,440 --> 02:27:06,960
So that's the answer to your question.

2696
02:27:06,960 --> 02:27:12,320
Now with Capcom and Eidos, can we get, you know, Capcom's not willing to get Eidos to

2697
02:27:12,320 --> 02:27:12,880
do it.

2698
02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:13,120
All right.

2699
02:27:13,120 --> 02:27:14,240
There's the official answer.

2700
02:27:14,240 --> 02:27:16,960
There's the official OLR approved answer to your question.

2701
02:27:16,960 --> 02:27:17,760
No one special.

2702
02:27:17,760 --> 02:27:19,200
The game we want to see is Powerstone.

2703
02:27:21,040 --> 02:27:21,680
All right.

2704
02:27:21,680 --> 02:27:21,920
Yeah.

2705
02:27:21,920 --> 02:27:25,440
Orange Wright says that's one of the few reasons I turn on my Vita is Powerstone collection.

2706
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:26,880
Yes, that's true.

2707
02:27:26,880 --> 02:27:27,600
They have that there.

2708
02:27:28,320 --> 02:27:29,440
There's on the via TV.

2709
02:27:30,160 --> 02:27:35,200
I really, I really wish PlayStation five would do something with my Vita library.

2710
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:40,480
I know it's asking for a lot, but man, I would be so happy if I could just like play my digital

2711
02:27:40,480 --> 02:27:42,800
Vita purchase games on my PlayStation five.

2712
02:27:42,800 --> 02:27:45,040
Like I know, I know I'm reaching.

2713
02:27:45,040 --> 02:27:48,320
I know it's a big ask, but how awesome would that be?

2714
02:27:50,560 --> 02:27:53,840
They should be able to emulate it with the power of the PlayStation five.

2715
02:27:53,840 --> 02:27:54,640
I mean, come on.

2716
02:27:55,680 --> 02:28:00,320
I get angry when I think, because like the best version of Final Fantasy four is on the

2717
02:28:00,480 --> 02:28:03,040
Vita or actually was on the PSP, but also Vita.

2718
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:08,960
And then Powerstone collection and luminous and active says, I want Tyco.

2719
02:28:10,400 --> 02:28:11,600
Like, yeah, my God.

2720
02:28:13,280 --> 02:28:14,080
That's what I want.

2721
02:28:14,080 --> 02:28:15,360
Sony help.

2722
02:28:15,360 --> 02:28:15,860
All right.

2723
02:28:17,040 --> 02:28:19,600
That's going to do it for another episode of orange lounge radio.

2724
02:28:19,600 --> 02:28:23,200
Then we're going to start to wrap things up here by getting everybody's final thoughts.

2725
02:28:23,200 --> 02:28:25,840
But first I want to thank you guys for tuning into our show tonight.

2726
02:28:26,560 --> 02:28:29,840
So of course we do tape live Sunday nights at the voice geeks network,

2727
02:28:29,920 --> 02:28:32,080
starting at about six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern.

2728
02:28:32,720 --> 02:28:35,920
And if, uh, you know, we don't ask for your money or anything like that.

2729
02:28:35,920 --> 02:28:39,200
We were, we appreciate the bits and love the followers and all that.

2730
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:41,040
And I really, really appreciate all that stuff.

2731
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:44,560
And so I want to say thank you for that, but you know what really, really helps the show

2732
02:28:44,560 --> 02:28:45,520
is word of mouth.

2733
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:48,560
So if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio, tell a friend or two about the

2734
02:28:48,560 --> 02:28:51,120
show, um, that word of mouth goes an awful long way.

2735
02:28:51,120 --> 02:28:54,640
The hosting is awesome too on Twitch, if you're willing to do that.

2736
02:28:54,640 --> 02:28:58,880
But even if you just show up every week, we're happy to have you and, uh, really appreciate

2737
02:28:58,880 --> 02:28:59,600
that as well.

2738
02:29:00,160 --> 02:29:04,560
A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Google play, wherever it is.

2739
02:29:04,560 --> 02:29:07,920
Although I heard podcasting is going away and Google play and moving somewhere else.

2740
02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:11,920
So wherever it is you found this show, uh, appreciate that type of word of mouth too.

2741
02:29:12,480 --> 02:29:13,040
Uh, all right.

2742
02:29:13,040 --> 02:29:16,000
With that, let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

2743
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:17,600
So Loki, we'll start with you tonight.

2744
02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:18,240
Your final thought.

2745
02:29:18,880 --> 02:29:22,000
I'm hopefully going to build some more Legos on stream.

2746
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:25,520
Um, I don't know at some point we'll get around to it, I guess.

2747
02:29:26,080 --> 02:29:27,760
Um, I'd like to do that.

2748
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:32,880
Uh, my final thought is definitely want to play no man's sky this week.

2749
02:29:32,880 --> 02:29:36,800
I'm, I'm feeling invigorated having helped delve in out through those first few stages

2750
02:29:36,800 --> 02:29:38,800
and someday we'll play multiplayer.

2751
02:29:38,800 --> 02:29:42,960
Uh, I've got a stream animal crossing this week now with dark soccer, cause I'm really

2752
02:29:42,960 --> 02:29:44,160
into this idea.

2753
02:29:44,160 --> 02:29:48,240
And, uh, and only one other person sent me their code for a dream Island, but we'll go

2754
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:49,840
visit it if nothing else.

2755
02:29:49,840 --> 02:29:54,560
And, uh, number three, there's a final fantasy 14 patch finally after a long wait this week.

2756
02:29:54,560 --> 02:29:56,720
And I'm very, very excited to play that as well.

2757
02:29:56,800 --> 02:29:59,920
Cause it's the conclusion to this latest expansion story.

2758
02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:01,760
So I'm really excited to explore that.

2759
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:08,000
And they are finally taking the chop to the realm reborn content.

2760
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:12,480
So if you thought your biggest problem with fantasy 14 was it takes too fucking long to

2761
02:30:12,480 --> 02:30:13,920
get through realm reborn.

2762
02:30:13,920 --> 02:30:14,400
Good news.

2763
02:30:14,400 --> 02:30:16,240
They're cutting it way down this next expansion.

2764
02:30:16,240 --> 02:30:17,200
That's a great thing.

2765
02:30:17,200 --> 02:30:18,160
Or I'm sorry, this next patch.

2766
02:30:18,160 --> 02:30:19,040
That's a great thing.

2767
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:21,200
Uh, last but not least dark soccer, your final thought.

2768
02:30:22,080 --> 02:30:26,800
So I decided to go ahead and look up the character, um, uh, stuff for shadow lands.

2769
02:30:27,440 --> 02:30:30,080
And one of the undead literally has the Elvira hair.

2770
02:30:32,240 --> 02:30:33,360
That's awesome.

2771
02:30:33,360 --> 02:30:34,240
It's the best thing.

2772
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:34,800
Yeah.

2773
02:30:34,800 --> 02:30:39,280
Um, but no, another thing is just make sure everybody makes sure you are registered to

2774
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:39,840
vote.

2775
02:30:39,840 --> 02:30:44,560
Make sure you get everything that you need to vote by mail and then vote accordingly.

2776
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:48,880
Or be prepared to drop off your ballot in person.

2777
02:30:48,880 --> 02:30:49,120
Yeah.

2778
02:30:49,120 --> 02:30:51,760
And vote early because, you know, mail will be slow.

2779
02:30:52,480 --> 02:30:53,280
Exactly.

2780
02:30:53,280 --> 02:30:55,760
Do do the thing, make change happen.

2781
02:30:55,760 --> 02:30:55,920
Yeah.

2782
02:30:56,800 --> 02:31:00,320
I would really think as long as you're, you know, if you're immunocompromised, this still

2783
02:31:00,320 --> 02:31:03,600
might be a risk for you, but if you're willing to like put on a mask and just generally stay

2784
02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:09,040
away from people, drop off your ballot in person, that's the best way to do it.

2785
02:31:09,040 --> 02:31:12,240
I'm going to spend every episode, like the end of drag race.

2786
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:17,360
Are you going to dance around with the sign that says registered to vote?

2787
02:31:17,360 --> 02:31:18,720
No, I'm not going to do that.

2788
02:31:18,880 --> 02:31:19,200
Okay.

2789
02:31:20,240 --> 02:31:20,480
All right.

2790
02:31:20,480 --> 02:31:22,480
I'm also sending you the old my right here.

2791
02:31:22,480 --> 02:31:23,200
All right.

2792
02:31:23,200 --> 02:31:27,680
That is going to do it for my first hands-free episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2793
02:31:28,320 --> 02:31:32,400
Thank you so much for listening to the show tonight and checking out our show.

2794
02:31:33,280 --> 02:31:37,520
We will be back again to do it all in seven days or another week and who knows what type

2795
02:31:37,520 --> 02:31:37,760
of news.

2796
02:31:37,760 --> 02:31:40,080
Maybe we'll get another surprise Nintendo announcement.

2797
02:31:40,080 --> 02:31:41,680
We can dream, right?

2798
02:31:41,680 --> 02:31:42,480
We'll see.

2799
02:31:42,480 --> 02:31:43,920
Until then, have a great week, everybody.

2800
02:31:46,560 --> 02:31:48,640
No, all you have to do is climb that hill.

2801
02:31:49,280 --> 02:31:50,720
And make a deal with God.

2802
02:31:50,720 --> 02:31:51,200
All right.

2803
02:31:51,200 --> 02:31:51,760
That's it.

2804
02:31:51,760 --> 02:31:52,320
We're out of here.

2805
02:31:52,320 --> 02:31:53,440
That's running up that hill.

2806
02:31:53,440 --> 02:31:53,680
Okay.

2807
02:31:54,240 --> 02:31:54,740
Bye.
