00:00.000 --> 00:13.640
I have fond memories of seeing SNK MVS cabinets in arcades, reading the cards for the list

00:13.640 --> 00:16.360
of games and then jamming the switch game button to see if it's accurate.

00:16.360 --> 00:20.520
Unico's MVSX classic system tickles my fancy in a way that modded cabinets never did, with

00:20.520 --> 00:24.760
all the benefits of an LCD instead of a CRT and the optional stand speaks to its dramatically

00:24.760 --> 00:26.900
increased portability due to weight alone.

00:26.900 --> 00:30.380
This is just my opinion, but I know that your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki

00:30.380 --> 00:34.260
also lived in the era of SNK proliferation, and they'll opine about this too, starting

00:34.260 --> 00:36.740
right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.740 --> 00:45.140
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:45.140 --> 00:47.260
where every gamer has a voice.

00:47.260 --> 00:53.980
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back again live tonight with episode number 832

00:53.980 --> 00:58.140
of our show for this August the 16th of 2020.

00:58.140 --> 01:02.260
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me tonight is Techmaster Loki.

01:02.260 --> 01:03.260
Hello.

01:03.260 --> 01:06.480
Hi Loki, how are you doing?

01:06.480 --> 01:07.480
I'm doing good.

01:07.480 --> 01:08.480
Awesome.

01:08.480 --> 01:12.700
Not joining us tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers, she has the night off, but her presence

01:12.700 --> 01:15.940
in the show lives on through that awesome new theme song.

01:15.940 --> 01:19.900
If you haven't heard OLR in a while, we changed some things up a few months ago.

01:19.900 --> 01:22.700
So that great new theme song by DarkSakura.

01:22.700 --> 01:24.740
She'll be back next week with us live.

01:24.740 --> 01:30.660
But I am joined by Techmaster Loki and all those of you in our chat over at twitch.tv

01:30.660 --> 01:35.860
slash vog network or the voice geeks network, VOG network, because we do tape live every

01:35.860 --> 01:39.700
Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf

01:39.700 --> 01:42.520
show at twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:42.520 --> 01:43.520
I just said it.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.540
Anyhow, how are you doing, Loki?

01:45.540 --> 01:47.100
You had a good week?

01:47.100 --> 01:50.980
Yeah, it's been all right.

01:50.980 --> 01:53.480
It is extremely hot this weekend.

01:53.480 --> 01:56.860
I think a lot of the country is going through this, especially the West Coast.

01:56.860 --> 02:00.300
But I'm here where the show is based in Sacramento, California.

02:00.300 --> 02:03.860
I believe the temperature today was one hundred and nine.

02:03.860 --> 02:05.620
It was more probably more than that.

02:05.620 --> 02:08.060
I was like one hundred and twelve in the shade in my car.

02:08.060 --> 02:09.060
Oh, my God.

02:09.060 --> 02:11.380
Lisa's what said.

02:11.380 --> 02:16.500
And then we had a had a guest appearance apparently in Northern California of a fire tornado.

02:16.500 --> 02:17.500
So that was a thing.

02:17.500 --> 02:18.500
Oh, yeah.

02:18.500 --> 02:19.500
Twenty twenty.

02:19.500 --> 02:20.500
What else is twenty twenty got for us?

02:21.020 --> 02:24.500
We're already having to do this show over discord thanks to that whole pandemic that's

02:24.500 --> 02:26.500
going on that you might have heard of.

02:26.500 --> 02:27.700
And now we have fire tornadoes.

02:27.700 --> 02:28.700
Lovely.

02:28.700 --> 02:29.700
Yeah.

02:29.700 --> 02:31.540
The weather was really crazy today because it was actually raining.

02:31.540 --> 02:36.180
Like we have cloud cover and it was raining, but it is still over one hundred degrees outside.

02:36.180 --> 02:39.780
And I'm like, this is not like usually when the clouds come in and the rain start, that

02:39.780 --> 02:41.260
means you're going to get a lower temperature.

02:41.260 --> 02:43.020
So it's it's weird.

02:43.020 --> 02:46.660
And you know, I'm not I'm not going to say I know everything about meteorology.

02:46.660 --> 02:51.340
Obviously, these types of things happen, but it's just I'm not used to it living here.

02:51.340 --> 02:52.980
So, yeah, we're in a crazy heat wave right now.

02:52.980 --> 02:59.500
I almost chose to do tonight's show with the light off and just sit in the dark and apologize

02:59.500 --> 03:00.500
to the people.

03:00.500 --> 03:03.340
We can do an are you afraid of the dark episode?

03:03.340 --> 03:04.340
Right.

03:04.340 --> 03:06.900
I oh, I could have done the episode by candlelight.

03:06.900 --> 03:11.380
I wish I thought these things beforehand, but the truth is the light is all the way

03:11.380 --> 03:12.380
over there.

03:12.380 --> 03:13.380
It's an LED light.

03:13.380 --> 03:16.340
So it doesn't really do a lot of heat, give off a lot of heat.

03:16.340 --> 03:18.820
Honestly, a candle probably would have given off more heat.

03:18.820 --> 03:21.060
So it's probably OK this way.

03:21.060 --> 03:24.340
It's just, you know, trying to conserve all the electricity because they're really kind

03:24.340 --> 03:26.180
of stressing to us here in California.

03:26.180 --> 03:31.660
You got to conserve electricity because some areas are having rolling blackouts.

03:31.660 --> 03:35.180
We have a government utility that runs things here in Sacramento.

03:35.180 --> 03:37.600
There's a Sacramento municipal utility.

03:37.600 --> 03:44.420
So I'm not as worried about shutoffs and things because they never have problems, but they

03:44.420 --> 03:46.340
have their shit together.

03:46.340 --> 03:51.140
Like you could say what you want about the government, but I've never had problems with

03:51.140 --> 03:52.660
the energy company here.

03:52.660 --> 03:57.500
So I'll actually be sad if I ever move out of city limits and have to go back to a different

03:57.500 --> 03:58.500
company.

03:58.500 --> 04:04.300
So is that we just need a government run Internet company as well so we can get that reliable,

04:04.300 --> 04:08.820
fast Internet for less money than it would cost the third parties.

04:08.820 --> 04:10.580
Some day, some day.

04:10.580 --> 04:15.180
Bobby Blackwell in chat says, fun fact, I recorded my whole show on a camcorder just

04:15.180 --> 04:16.740
off screen for reasons.

04:16.740 --> 04:20.580
I have a feeling I might know what those reasons might be.

04:20.580 --> 04:22.340
And I can't really tell you what they are.

04:22.340 --> 04:25.880
But hey, in a related thing, maybe.

04:25.880 --> 04:29.140
Did you know that Dragon Con is going virtual this year?

04:29.140 --> 04:31.120
There's going to be a virtual Dragon Con event.

04:31.120 --> 04:36.360
So you can actually participate from home and watch different channels that will have

04:36.360 --> 04:37.720
different types of events.

04:37.720 --> 04:41.860
And the good news is, is that the digital media track, which is one of the tracks that

04:41.860 --> 04:47.060
I've worked with in the past, is going to be doing kind of their own like panel schedule

04:47.060 --> 04:50.680
thing like they would do during the convention, except it's going to be all virtual and it's

04:50.680 --> 04:52.300
going to be on Twitch.

04:52.300 --> 04:55.760
And I'm going to be on three of the panels over the weekend.

04:55.760 --> 05:00.000
So there and actually one of them is during OLR.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.400
So in in the gray, that's going to be some multitasking you're doing there.

05:03.400 --> 05:07.740
Well, I figured in the great tradition of the past seven years since we've never done

05:07.740 --> 05:11.300
a show Labor Day weekend anyway, why should this year be any different?

05:11.300 --> 05:13.940
So we'll probably just not do a show that night.

05:13.940 --> 05:14.940
And I don't know.

05:14.940 --> 05:18.720
I don't know if Bobby's doing a show that night after all or what, but I already kind

05:18.720 --> 05:22.620
of told him we probably won't just because I'm doing a panel that starts at six o'clock

05:22.620 --> 05:23.620
Pacific.

05:23.620 --> 05:24.620
So, oops.

05:24.620 --> 05:28.180
Well, hopefully they advertise it more than Comic-Con did, because, you know, that did

05:28.180 --> 05:29.180
the same.

05:29.180 --> 05:30.780
They have the same thing with their tracks and everything.

05:30.780 --> 05:35.160
And I didn't know it was even a thing until, like, I think probably was over.

05:35.160 --> 05:40.680
Well, you better believe I'll be blowing shit up on Twitter, pimping on my schedule.

05:40.680 --> 05:44.480
I was hoping there might be something with the video game track, too, but I wasn't reached

05:44.480 --> 05:46.400
out to, which is OK, because I know everything.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.920
I'm not saying like, oh, they should be calling me.

05:48.920 --> 05:51.960
No, everything is crazy this year because it's virtual and they've probably had to come

05:51.960 --> 05:56.160
up with some plan, you know, and I totally understand and I can't wait to see everybody

05:56.160 --> 06:00.260
in person again in 2021, hopefully.

06:00.260 --> 06:06.180
But, you know, I am going to be doing the stuff with the digital media track and I'm

06:06.180 --> 06:07.400
excited about that.

06:07.400 --> 06:11.920
And I was reached out to by another track, too, that I've never worked with before and

06:11.920 --> 06:13.720
I really wanted to do it.

06:13.720 --> 06:17.160
But I don't want to say what it was because I don't want to I don't want to sound disrespectful

06:17.160 --> 06:20.800
or anything, because the reality was I didn't know anything about the subject they wanted

06:20.800 --> 06:23.320
me to do.

06:23.320 --> 06:27.480
But it doesn't have to do a gaming, it doesn't have to do a broadcasting.

06:27.480 --> 06:31.020
Think really hard for those of you that listen to orange entree over the years.

06:31.020 --> 06:34.420
There's some other things that I do on the weekend and I haven't done them this year

06:34.420 --> 06:35.580
because of covid.

06:35.580 --> 06:36.580
But think really hard.

06:36.580 --> 06:40.820
You might be able to piece it together and but they were really cool about it.

06:40.820 --> 06:44.640
They were like, oh, thank you for being honest, because, you know, I'm sure there's a lot

06:44.640 --> 06:46.780
of people that are like, oh, sure, I'll just fake it.

06:46.780 --> 06:48.220
I'll fake it and do a good job.

06:48.220 --> 06:51.380
And we don't want to watch that panel where the person is faking it.

06:51.380 --> 06:55.740
So out of respect to the panel, I said I wasn't going to do it.

06:55.740 --> 07:00.680
So all right, S.S.U. 100 Matt in chat says the food track.

07:00.680 --> 07:02.160
I knew it.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.960
I wish there was a food track.

07:03.960 --> 07:06.120
That would be awesome.

07:06.120 --> 07:08.280
I don't think there is a food track now.

07:08.280 --> 07:09.720
There should be a food track.

07:09.720 --> 07:14.920
I mean, there are food trucks that are parked near the convention and they certainly have.

07:14.920 --> 07:18.740
Actually, I will say over the over the seven, eight years, I've literally lost count.

07:18.740 --> 07:21.840
I think this would have been year eight had I gone.

07:21.840 --> 07:22.980
I guess I am going.

07:22.980 --> 07:24.440
I'm going digitally, whatever.

07:24.440 --> 07:28.440
So out of the eight years I've been going to Dragon Con, the first couple of years,

07:28.440 --> 07:32.800
I don't remember them having food so accessible in the hotels.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.800
But the hotels really wised up.

07:34.800 --> 07:39.020
They got vendors like Papa John's, which say what you will about their pizza.

07:39.020 --> 07:42.820
But when it's drunk and they're close by, you really don't care.

07:42.820 --> 07:44.620
You know, they're there within the hotels.

07:44.620 --> 07:47.740
My absolute favorite thing in the world, this would be the last Dragon Con thing I say and

07:47.740 --> 07:49.420
then we can get into video game news.

07:49.420 --> 07:54.760
My absolute favorite thing in the world is the alcohol ice cream.

07:54.760 --> 07:57.640
So they actually sell ice cream that has alcohol in it.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.360
And it's it's outstanding.

07:59.360 --> 08:01.660
And I'm sure Bobby will shout the name of the vendor because I can't remember it off

08:01.660 --> 08:02.760
top my head.

08:02.760 --> 08:06.020
But they started showing up two years ago and they've been there.

08:06.020 --> 08:07.740
And I think it's it's brilliant.

08:07.740 --> 08:08.900
And I love their ice cream.

08:08.900 --> 08:11.060
And it's a great thing to kind of just take down with you.

08:11.060 --> 08:12.540
And I'm just eating ice cream.

08:12.540 --> 08:13.540
Everybody teehee.

08:13.540 --> 08:15.540
Oh, Bobby can't remember their name in the moment either.

08:15.540 --> 08:17.540
Well, that's OK.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.300
This Ben to Dragon Con will know what I'm talking about.

08:19.300 --> 08:21.780
But yeah, stay tuned for Dragon Con.

08:21.780 --> 08:24.780
Speaking of events going virtual, I want to make sure a plug goes out for this and then

08:24.780 --> 08:26.380
we'll get into tonight's kickoff topic.

08:26.380 --> 08:30.580
So Loki, I'll have you take care of the kickoff topic here in a moment.

08:30.580 --> 08:34.040
But Summer Games Done Quick just kicked off today.

08:34.040 --> 08:38.040
And I know a lot of you guys watched that event as well as the awesome Games Done Quick

08:38.040 --> 08:40.280
event in January.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.280
Awesome event.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.940
It's not just a clever name for charity.

08:42.940 --> 08:46.220
They raise a lot of money doing a lot of speed runs.

08:46.220 --> 08:49.420
And usually we're kind of sitting here just kind of like going, oh, what a great event.

08:49.420 --> 08:50.420
We watch it.

08:50.420 --> 08:51.420
We're fans.

08:51.420 --> 08:52.420
We partake.

08:52.420 --> 08:53.420
We might donate if we're able to and so forth.

08:53.420 --> 08:58.100
But very little do we actually get involved.

08:58.100 --> 09:00.700
Last year, our voiceover guy, Jason, got involved.

09:00.700 --> 09:01.820
I think it was last year.

09:01.820 --> 09:05.020
Sorry, Jason, if I'm I'm cutting that short, it might have been two years ago.

09:05.020 --> 09:11.080
But last year, Jason got involved being doing things on site with the Games Done Quick event.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.080
And that was really cool to hear about.

09:12.080 --> 09:16.120
And I think he came on the show at one point and was talking to us a little bit about that.

09:16.120 --> 09:21.800
This year, VOG Network's own Bobby Blackwolf on Before Us here at the VoiceGeeks Network

09:21.800 --> 09:27.240
is actually going to be one of the hosts, is what they call them, announcers, voiceover

09:27.240 --> 09:35.080
folks, while the speed run for Devil May Cry 4 is going on on Wednesday night at 11 o'clock

09:35.080 --> 09:37.080
Eastern, 8 Pacific.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.080
I hope I got that right.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.560
Don't be mad if I'm not.

09:40.560 --> 09:45.080
Bobby Blackwolf is actually going to be the guy that reads donations now and again when

09:45.080 --> 09:48.460
the speed runners ask him to do so.

09:48.460 --> 09:51.000
My understanding is this is a pretty tight speed run.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.840
There's probably not going to be a lot, a lot of donations and so forth that are able

09:54.840 --> 09:55.840
to be read.

09:55.840 --> 09:59.240
But I think it's really cool that Bobby's getting that opportunity to like jump in there

09:59.240 --> 10:00.240
and be in there.

10:00.240 --> 10:05.600
So I know I plan to watch just to support Bobby, but also to support the awesome charity

10:05.600 --> 10:10.140
and the speed runners that really make this event possible.

10:10.140 --> 10:16.100
And if you do decide to donate, make sure your donation isn't about VOG Network or Bobby.

10:16.100 --> 10:18.740
We can dish about that over here on Sunday night when it's over.

10:18.740 --> 10:21.760
Make sure your donations about the speed runner or about the charity.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.700
If you want, you can do like host choice.

10:23.700 --> 10:27.980
That's a nice little way to let Bobby have a little bit of power if you want.

10:27.980 --> 10:31.320
But yeah, don't spam chat with VOG Network.

10:31.320 --> 10:32.320
That's silly.

10:32.320 --> 10:33.920
Don't do that stuff, please.

10:33.920 --> 10:38.420
Please make it about the charity, which is Doctors Without Borders if you hadn't heard.

10:38.420 --> 10:43.980
And what a time to do that, because, you know, even though it's looking like we will have

10:43.980 --> 10:49.300
a vaccine of some sort in 2021, fingers crossed, toast crossed, et cetera, the news is looking

10:49.300 --> 10:50.860
very good there, right?

10:50.860 --> 10:56.180
The reality is, even though our country, the U.S., will get the vaccine, Canada will get

10:56.180 --> 10:59.580
the vaccine, UK, I'm sure, will get the vaccine and so on and so on.

10:59.580 --> 11:02.900
Many industrialized nations around the world will get the vaccine.

11:02.900 --> 11:06.580
COVID is still going to be a thing on our planet because there's going to be a lot of

11:06.580 --> 11:13.340
nations that aren't going to be able to get that vaccine for their people as fast.

11:13.340 --> 11:18.120
But an organization like Doctors Without Borders can help treat sick people and so forth in

11:18.120 --> 11:19.120
these countries.

11:19.120 --> 11:22.100
And I mean, they were on the front lines and things like Ebola and SARS and things are

11:22.100 --> 11:23.100
happening too.

11:23.100 --> 11:27.180
So it's a great charity to support because the reality is and all the experts have said

11:27.180 --> 11:30.100
this COVID-19 is not going away.

11:30.100 --> 11:32.500
We're not going to eradicate it from the planet.

11:32.540 --> 11:37.620
Hopefully, fingers, toast crossed, we eradicate it from our nation like Ebola, right?

11:37.620 --> 11:40.260
We don't hear about that anymore, but Ebola is still a thing.

11:40.260 --> 11:43.900
You hear about a breakout now and then in some country and so forth, and that may be

11:43.900 --> 11:45.940
the story for COVID-19.

11:45.940 --> 11:54.620
So anyway, Bobby actually says this is the first year that Doctors Without Borders operated

11:54.620 --> 11:56.100
in the U.S.

11:56.100 --> 11:58.540
They were in New York a few months ago.

11:58.540 --> 12:02.100
So during when New York was the epicenter of the COVID thing.

12:02.260 --> 12:04.700
Bobby also says the time is likely to change.

12:04.700 --> 12:09.260
It was originally 10 p.m. Eastern, but now it's like 1130 Eastern.

12:09.260 --> 12:13.620
And that just happens as you know, I think they had a little tech kick up this morning

12:13.620 --> 12:17.460
and I'm sure some speed runs run longer, shorter, whatever happens there.

12:17.460 --> 12:18.780
So times are fluid.

12:18.780 --> 12:21.500
That's why my brain was going, I'm not sure this is right.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.020
Yeah, because I was hearing a couple of times.

12:23.020 --> 12:24.020
That's why.

12:24.020 --> 12:25.020
All right.

12:25.020 --> 12:26.020
Just check the website.

12:26.020 --> 12:27.020
Look at the schedule there.

12:27.020 --> 12:28.020
Oh, yeah.

12:28.020 --> 12:29.020
Yeah, that's a good way to stay on top of it.

12:29.020 --> 12:32.860
I'm sure Bobby's going to send out a tweet or something.

12:32.860 --> 12:40.660
And also our Discord is a great place to be over at vognetwork.com, vognetwork.com slash

12:40.660 --> 12:41.660
Discord.

12:41.660 --> 12:42.980
We'll get you into our Discord server.

12:42.980 --> 12:44.860
That's a great place to be as well.

12:44.860 --> 12:51.980
And if you want, I'm pretty sure we'll do this as well as while Bobby is actually doing

12:51.980 --> 12:55.340
the games done quick, we'll probably host it.

12:55.340 --> 12:56.580
I haven't talked to him about this.

12:56.580 --> 13:02.960
I don't know if this is a faux pas, but we'll probably host it so that our chat can say

13:02.960 --> 13:07.820
whatever we want about, yay, Bobby and all that stuff in our chat, the VOG network chat.

13:07.820 --> 13:10.820
But I don't know if that might be frowned on because maybe Summer Games wants the viewers.

13:10.820 --> 13:11.820
I don't know.

13:11.820 --> 13:14.860
But as long as they're, as long as y'all are donating that, okay, Bobby says, yes, I was

13:14.860 --> 13:15.860
going to host it.

13:15.860 --> 13:16.860
Phew.

13:16.860 --> 13:17.860
Okay.

13:17.860 --> 13:19.660
So we'll host it on the VOG network channel when he's going.

13:19.660 --> 13:20.660
So that'll be great.

13:20.660 --> 13:21.660
Okay.

13:21.660 --> 13:22.660
Cool.

13:22.660 --> 13:23.660
And they like hosts.

13:23.660 --> 13:24.660
Yay.

13:24.660 --> 13:25.660
Because it is about the charity at the end of the day.

13:25.740 --> 13:27.340
So let's get into some news.

13:27.340 --> 13:30.860
There's some big news that happened this week.

13:30.860 --> 13:31.860
And this is a big one.

13:31.860 --> 13:37.780
A lot of people on social media are watching because I think we on social media are being

13:37.780 --> 13:39.700
recruited for this effort.

13:39.700 --> 13:40.700
Aren't we, Loki?

13:40.700 --> 13:41.700
What's going on?

13:41.700 --> 13:47.980
Well, of course, because they have to get all the kiddies to, you know, blindly advocate

13:47.980 --> 13:48.980
for them.

13:49.300 --> 13:59.420
billionaire company, Epic Games, had made some updates to Fortnite's client in iOS and

13:59.420 --> 14:01.300
Android.

14:01.300 --> 14:06.100
And they added a direct payment option that was cheaper on those devices.

14:06.100 --> 14:13.500
So what they basically did is surpassed the normally required processes through their

14:13.500 --> 14:19.020
respective app stores where both Apple and Google take a cut of that.

14:19.020 --> 14:21.620
That's how they make their money.

14:21.620 --> 14:26.660
And so Epic complained about it before and whined about it.

14:26.660 --> 14:29.500
And I think even if I remember correctly, like at one point, they're like, well, we're

14:29.500 --> 14:34.300
not even going to put it on the Androids or the Google Play Store because we don't like

14:34.300 --> 14:35.300
that.

14:35.300 --> 14:40.380
So they had their own separate launcher and then it was kind of a pain to get it installed

14:40.380 --> 14:44.660
on your device or like paying for your target audience.

14:44.660 --> 14:49.260
I believe throughout all this separate launcher is still there.

14:49.260 --> 14:56.740
Yeah, so now they of course, they were integrated into those stores.

14:56.740 --> 15:02.220
And so now they added this direct pay option, which definitely goes against the, you know,

15:02.220 --> 15:04.380
rules to be on those storefronts.

15:04.380 --> 15:10.460
And so immediately, as they probably expected, because they definitely planned all this,

15:10.460 --> 15:17.180
they were booted off of the Epic Games Store, or I'm sorry, off of the iOS store and also

15:17.180 --> 15:19.100
the Google Play Store.

15:19.100 --> 15:26.900
And then of course, they put out this ridiculous parody video of like one of the old Apple

15:26.900 --> 15:35.780
commercials talk, you know, basically calling, you know, Apple, this very, this controlling

15:35.780 --> 15:40.060
entity for their store, which be honest, it's their storefront, they can do whatever they

15:40.060 --> 15:41.060
want.

15:41.060 --> 15:42.060
They can make the rules.

15:42.060 --> 15:46.260
I don't necessarily like that there's an open option, whereas on Android, if you don't want

15:46.260 --> 15:51.660
to use the Google Play Store, there's other options, but it's not necessarily as preferable.

15:51.660 --> 15:55.020
And there's stuff you have to do to sideload all that.

15:55.020 --> 15:56.020
Two things.

15:56.140 --> 16:02.940
One, the commercial was a direct parody of a 1984 style commercial that Apple did way

16:02.940 --> 16:03.940
back in the day.

16:03.940 --> 16:06.580
I don't know if it was Olympics or Super Bowl or something like that, but it was an ad that

16:06.580 --> 16:11.100
they did to try to kind of announce that, you know, Apple was coming and it was coming

16:11.100 --> 16:14.300
for the dominant IBM machines at the time.

16:14.300 --> 16:18.740
Although I seem to recall Commodore 64 was still a thing in 84 and all this other stuff.

16:18.740 --> 16:24.260
So my history is a little blurry there, but I know it is a direct parody of an Apple Macintosh

16:24.300 --> 16:25.540
commercial, like shot for shot.

16:25.540 --> 16:29.620
Like Bobby had a whole side by side on his show that went, I didn't realize how close

16:29.620 --> 16:32.800
to the original it really was until he played that shot for shot.

16:32.800 --> 16:39.740
But number two, I must admit, I expected you to come out guns a blazing on Epic's side

16:39.740 --> 16:41.040
with this.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.040
But you definitely-

16:42.040 --> 16:45.460
Oh, I'm not going to take the side of a billionaire company, I'm sorry.

16:45.460 --> 16:49.660
I'm just a little, I'm a little surprised, but I'm pleasantly surprised.

16:49.660 --> 16:54.980
Why should they get, why should they get an exception to the rule when all the other

16:54.980 --> 16:57.540
smaller developers have to pay that same fee?

16:57.540 --> 16:58.540
I'm sorry.

16:58.540 --> 17:01.440
No big company don't get special treatment.

17:01.440 --> 17:04.380
So you know, I think it's stupid.

17:04.380 --> 17:09.280
But anyways, they're of course filing a lawsuit against those two companies, which is already

17:09.280 --> 17:10.280
drawn up.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.140
So obviously all this was already planned out.

17:12.140 --> 17:15.140
And of course at the same time, they also have a hashtag that they want you to go on

17:15.140 --> 17:21.260
social media and complain to Apple and Google that, oh, we need to go our launcher away.

17:21.260 --> 17:24.740
I mean, it's absolutely ridiculous.

17:24.740 --> 17:26.860
First off, please don't do that.

17:26.860 --> 17:31.180
I mean, I would respect our listeners enough to know that they're smart enough to know

17:31.180 --> 17:34.380
not to advocate for corporations.

17:34.380 --> 17:40.620
You don't need to advocate for a company that is literally, they're literally fighting over

17:40.620 --> 17:45.180
money when they make billions and billions and billions of dollars, and they will continue

17:45.180 --> 17:48.860
to make billions and billions and billions of dollars after all this is done too.

17:48.860 --> 17:52.180
Please do not feel the need to advocate for them.

17:52.180 --> 17:53.180
They are big boys.

17:53.180 --> 17:54.540
They can handle themselves.

17:54.540 --> 18:01.940
So it's just ridiculous to try to throw some bad press away just to try to get their way.

18:01.940 --> 18:02.940
What's Epic doing?

18:02.940 --> 18:03.940
They're not playing fair either.

18:03.940 --> 18:07.180
I mean, they're the ones they're paying for exclusives and stuff on their platform to

18:07.180 --> 18:09.180
try to get people to go to the Epic game store.

18:09.180 --> 18:12.420
Yeah, they're offering a discount for developers that go on there.

18:12.420 --> 18:13.420
That's great.

18:13.420 --> 18:14.420
If you want to take that, cool.

18:14.420 --> 18:16.380
But they're also not playing fair with other things.

18:16.380 --> 18:23.980
So it's ridiculous to think that they're like some white knight of the gaming industry.

18:23.980 --> 18:24.980
They're not.

18:24.980 --> 18:28.800
And I just think this whole thing is ridiculous.

18:28.800 --> 18:32.140
I'm a little stunned because I find I pretty much agree with Loki and I don't have a lot

18:32.140 --> 18:33.140
to add.

18:33.140 --> 18:36.900
This is a pleasant change.

18:36.900 --> 18:39.700
I mean, I know y'all like the debate and you tune in for that.

18:39.700 --> 18:43.040
But yeah, that I here's the thing.

18:43.040 --> 18:46.820
I don't consider that I'm like completely against Epic in this situation.

18:46.820 --> 18:53.700
I do understand some of the concerns, but don't think for a minute that Epic isn't trying

18:53.700 --> 18:58.700
to weaponize social media for their own purposes.

18:58.700 --> 19:01.220
And I think that is shady shade.

19:01.220 --> 19:07.940
That is, it's really, and it's transparent as fuck because they had that commercial ready

19:07.940 --> 19:09.220
to go.

19:09.220 --> 19:12.340
They strong arm this move ready to go.

19:12.340 --> 19:15.700
They had that legal paperwork ready to go.

19:15.700 --> 19:17.940
This was a calculated plan.

19:17.940 --> 19:18.940
For what?

19:18.940 --> 19:19.940
I'm going to tell you what.

19:19.940 --> 19:21.940
You know what else is ready to go?

19:21.940 --> 19:24.620
The Epic game store on iOS.

19:24.620 --> 19:31.060
Mark my words, timestamp this episode because if Epic wins this legal thing and Apple has

19:31.060 --> 19:36.240
to allow like other competing stores or whatever on because it's part of, it's part of, it's

19:36.240 --> 19:41.300
not as much in the big thing, but they do reference it like the having the game store

19:41.300 --> 19:42.300
or whatever.

19:42.300 --> 19:46.340
If this whole, if the courts end up signing with Epic, Epic will have their own game store

19:46.340 --> 19:49.300
up on iOS the next day.

19:49.300 --> 19:50.300
Why?

19:50.300 --> 19:52.980
Because they want to undercut Apple.

19:52.980 --> 19:56.860
And anything, and also, and even if you, and I understand there's people that are very,

19:56.860 --> 19:57.960
very pro Apple.

19:57.960 --> 20:03.120
There's people that are very, very anti Apple, but anything I'm saying Apple in this case

20:03.120 --> 20:04.940
also applies to Google.

20:04.940 --> 20:08.680
They are one in this, in this case, they are one in the same.

20:08.680 --> 20:11.400
There are other things about those stores that are very much, not the same like the

20:11.400 --> 20:15.520
cloud gaming, but with this, this particular Fortnite case, it's really the same thing

20:15.520 --> 20:17.760
on both sides.

20:17.760 --> 20:24.440
So if, if the courts end up siding with Epic the next day, the Epic game store is going

20:24.440 --> 20:25.760
to be available on iOS.

20:25.760 --> 20:28.200
The Epic game store is going to be available on Google play.

20:28.200 --> 20:31.480
And the Epic game store is going to immediately undercut that 30% fee.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.200
That's going to be the very first thing that they do.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.200
Okay, fine.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.680
I understand competition's good, but you know what Epic's going to do?

20:36.680 --> 20:38.600
They can go ahead and do that already though.

20:38.600 --> 20:42.800
They can literally build their own storefront on Android and just put it out there.

20:42.800 --> 20:46.840
Granted, you have to sideload it into your device, but they could literally do that.

20:46.840 --> 20:51.560
That, I mean, look at the, um, you know, they have the Amazon storefront for awhile, the

20:51.560 --> 20:56.800
Amazon app store and not as popular, but I mean, it's definitely, it's a thing that

20:56.800 --> 20:57.800
they could do.

20:57.800 --> 20:59.800
I, I don't understand.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.160
They could already go ahead and do that.

21:01.160 --> 21:06.840
It's just, they want to have like their launcher available on the Google play store and they

21:06.840 --> 21:08.240
also want to not pay the fee.

21:08.240 --> 21:09.240
I'm sorry.

21:09.240 --> 21:11.200
You can't be on a store.

21:11.200 --> 21:15.000
You have to play by the rules, you know, in order to be on their storefront.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.560
That's just the way it is.

21:16.560 --> 21:20.920
And so if you don't play by the rules and you can't be on there, I'm telling you, this

21:20.920 --> 21:23.560
is what's going to happen next after that.

21:23.560 --> 21:28.120
Because what is the other big thing in Epic's pocket right now is that they, they run a

21:28.120 --> 21:32.640
massively popular engine to write video games in.

21:32.640 --> 21:39.680
So how easy is it going to be for them to, in their own game publishing system, one touch

21:39.680 --> 21:43.060
published to the Epic game store on mobile devices.

21:43.060 --> 21:47.880
And now that game is available in their game store, but there'll be some type of exclusivity

21:47.880 --> 21:51.880
agreement or whatever the financial situation, whatever's going to be better.

21:51.880 --> 21:55.260
Who's who's now, who's got the dominating part of the market.

21:55.260 --> 21:57.280
Now who's trying to control it.

21:57.280 --> 21:59.060
And I'm telling you, this is Epic's big plan.

21:59.060 --> 22:01.640
I am telling you, this is what they want.

22:01.640 --> 22:04.260
And I don't even have to sit in the boardroom to know this.

22:04.260 --> 22:11.400
So I can understand why people want to needle Apple and Google on the way some of their

22:11.400 --> 22:13.240
stores are locked down.

22:13.240 --> 22:18.320
And especially like the cloud gaming thing, which I do think Google and Apple are going

22:18.320 --> 22:22.720
to need to, well, Google already has, I'm sorry, Apple needs to relent on the cloud

22:22.720 --> 22:23.840
gaming thing a little bit.

22:23.840 --> 22:28.680
They're going to need to treat the cloud gaming like Netflix, like Spotify, like Twitch.

22:28.680 --> 22:32.040
They don't, they don't moderate all of the content here.

22:32.040 --> 22:36.600
If you're watching on your iOS device, this stream right now, Apple didn't review it.

22:36.600 --> 22:37.600
You know what I mean?

22:37.600 --> 22:39.520
And I think they're going to have to take that same approach with games.

22:40.120 --> 22:44.100
So I'm not saying like, oh gosh, the stores are perfect in this particular scenario, but

22:44.100 --> 22:51.660
I do not see this as Epic fighting for the consumer, fighting for the little guy, fighting

22:51.660 --> 22:53.880
for a freer store.

22:53.880 --> 23:00.280
Epic wants a freer market that they can take advantage of, period.

23:00.280 --> 23:01.280
That's what they do.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.280
Right, exactly.

23:02.280 --> 23:06.560
Just like, just like all of the stuff that they did in, you know, to make things better

23:06.560 --> 23:10.000
against Steam really hasn't really done anything.

23:10.000 --> 23:15.920
All it's done is some games are now free on Epic store once a month and, and some games

23:15.920 --> 23:18.080
are only exclusively through the Epic store.

23:18.080 --> 23:21.400
And I now have to use two different launchers to play some games.

23:21.400 --> 23:26.760
Like I don't notice like it, they didn't change the industry.

23:26.760 --> 23:27.760
Sorry.

23:27.760 --> 23:30.240
You're not big enough to do that.

23:30.240 --> 23:32.280
You throw your money around and it's your exclusives.

23:32.280 --> 23:35.360
That doesn't, that's not because people wanted to come to your storefront, it's because you

23:35.360 --> 23:36.360
paid for it.

23:36.360 --> 23:41.420
And it's whatever, let, let them fight.

23:41.420 --> 23:47.260
I also feel that if Epic wants to be more competitive, maybe they should like fix their

23:47.260 --> 23:49.120
own damn store first.

23:49.120 --> 23:52.320
Like cause their store is still an inferior product on PC.

23:52.320 --> 23:53.320
Sorry.

23:53.320 --> 23:54.920
I said it, said it.

23:54.920 --> 24:00.160
And that's my opinion, but, and I use the Epic game store, hell yeah, I cash in on those

24:00.160 --> 24:05.400
free games, but the Epic game store is the only place that I've been hacked.

24:05.440 --> 24:07.320
That didn't happen to me on Steam.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.640
The Epic game store still doesn't have achievements.

24:09.640 --> 24:14.440
The Epic game store is still missing the ability to pay with preloaded cards.

24:14.440 --> 24:19.840
You know, there's still a lot of places where the Epic game store is really lagging behind.

24:19.840 --> 24:23.360
So there's a part of me that's like, why don't you use your resources to fix your own damn

24:23.360 --> 24:25.140
house first?

24:25.140 --> 24:27.720
Then you can, you know, kind of take on this other stuff.

24:27.720 --> 24:31.760
I don't know, but, and I want to be clear because I don't want to completely sound like

24:31.760 --> 24:37.080
I'm like a hundred percent pro the Apple and Google side of things.

24:37.080 --> 24:42.800
Because I do think Apple especially is, and I'm an Apple user, look, look, if you're on

24:42.800 --> 24:45.960
the Twitch feed right now, what do I have in my, I have Apple earbuds in my phone right

24:45.960 --> 24:46.960
now.

24:46.960 --> 24:47.960
Okay.

24:47.960 --> 24:48.960
There's a lot of Apple products I love.

24:48.960 --> 24:51.880
But I do think they're going a bit far with like the cloud gaming stuff.

24:51.880 --> 24:56.760
Like I said before, like if all this other stuff exists, why shouldn't video games be

24:56.760 --> 24:58.660
able to be streamed through the cloud and so forth?

24:58.660 --> 25:04.700
And I do think there needs to be a better kind of line drawn with, you know what, if

25:04.700 --> 25:08.620
you sell a product directly on your site, then whatever.

25:08.620 --> 25:11.660
But if you're selling it through the store, then yes, we get to have a cut.

25:11.660 --> 25:17.820
And my examples would be Spotify, Netflix, CBS, all of those things, you can go buy on

25:17.820 --> 25:20.220
the website.

25:20.220 --> 25:23.420
And I think, especially with Twitch, I think is a great example too, you can buy them on

25:23.420 --> 25:27.820
the website or you can buy them through the app, but you know what Twitch doesn't do?

25:28.700 --> 25:31.620
And they're more expensive if you buy them in the app, of course, because you know, they're

25:31.620 --> 25:35.700
having to pay for Apple's cut and they're passing that cost on to you.

25:35.700 --> 25:39.780
But what they don't do is they don't have a big old pop up that comes up and says, you

25:39.780 --> 25:44.620
can get these bits cheaper if you go directly to our website by clicking here and going

25:44.620 --> 25:45.620
to do that.

25:45.620 --> 25:49.480
And I do kind of see where there's probably going to have to be a line drawn there where

25:49.480 --> 25:56.500
there can't be like a click here to be instantly taken out of the store and go around that

25:56.500 --> 25:57.780
30% fee.

25:57.780 --> 26:00.820
I think it's going to have to be one of those things where, OK, if you do it on the website,

26:00.820 --> 26:01.820
then whatever.

26:01.820 --> 26:05.820
But if you do it from within the store, something from the store, then it's got to have that

26:05.820 --> 26:06.980
30% fee.

26:06.980 --> 26:09.700
And I would be OK with that, quite honestly.

26:09.700 --> 26:12.620
Like I think that's what Epic should be happy with as well.

26:12.620 --> 26:17.140
Like if they sell the thing on their own storefront, then whatever.

26:17.140 --> 26:19.380
And that's because you brought the purchase to them.

26:19.380 --> 26:20.500
I don't know.

26:20.500 --> 26:26.440
And I don't see them trying to burn the bridges with Microsoft and Sony as well, or even in

26:26.440 --> 26:29.560
Nintendo with their storefronts, because they all take a cut as well.

26:29.560 --> 26:34.480
I'm sure that's where the majority of their gamers are, that and PC.

26:34.480 --> 26:41.040
So, of course, these being a smaller market share on Android and iOS devices.

26:41.040 --> 26:42.680
That's probably why they're risking it there.

26:42.680 --> 26:46.440
But they sure as heck aren't going to do it at the other places because that would just

26:46.440 --> 26:47.440
destroy them.

26:47.440 --> 26:52.280
SSJ 100 Matt says, it's an ugly pinch fight between billionaires.

26:52.280 --> 26:54.680
We're the losers because we have to watch it.

26:55.200 --> 26:58.960
I don't know what a win looks like in this scenario.

26:58.960 --> 27:03.240
You know, again, if Epic comes out victorious in this whole thing, I'm not sure the confetti

27:03.240 --> 27:07.520
cannons should be readied, because what is that really going to mean?

27:07.520 --> 27:12.920
I just, you know, I'm pretty sure they're not the first company to sue Apple because

27:12.920 --> 27:16.000
they don't have an open storefront to allow other.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.840
I'm almost positive Spotify or Amazon has an Amazon sued them.

27:19.840 --> 27:23.320
I'm pretty sure maybe that was over the term app store.

27:23.320 --> 27:30.920
But I'm pretty sure that there's other companies that have sued them to try to get this opened

27:30.920 --> 27:36.280
up for other companies to have their own individual storefronts, but doesn't seem to have worked

27:36.280 --> 27:37.280
so far.

27:37.280 --> 27:41.720
I mean, I don't know if they think it's sure throw money at the problem, I guess, but Questbuster

27:41.720 --> 27:47.040
in chat says, as a side note, last year, Spotify filed an antitrust complaint against Apple,

27:47.040 --> 27:50.020
which is now part of the EU's ongoing investigation.

27:50.020 --> 27:53.660
They also mentioned the 30% cut, which they call attacks.

27:53.660 --> 27:55.660
There is that.

27:55.660 --> 27:57.720
I want to read a couple other comments here.

27:57.720 --> 27:58.720
This is important too.

27:58.720 --> 28:03.900
VG Realness in chat says, fuck Apple, fuck Google, and fuck Epic.

28:03.900 --> 28:06.440
I'm thinking of that scene.

28:06.440 --> 28:09.760
And sorry, it's going to be a Drag Race reference, Loki, but I'm thinking that scene from Untucked

28:09.760 --> 28:14.300
in season 12, where Heidi Ann Closet gets up and goes, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you,

28:14.300 --> 28:15.300
and fuck you.

28:15.300 --> 28:17.600
That's what VG Realness is doing right now.

28:17.600 --> 28:20.320
Fuck Apple, fuck Google, and fuck Epic.

28:20.320 --> 28:21.320
Rich.

28:21.320 --> 28:22.320
Yeah.

28:22.320 --> 28:26.080
Was that like, I can't remember which movie it was like, fuck you, fuck you.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.800
You're cool.

28:27.800 --> 28:32.120
I think that was, I think that was this movie about waiters waiting or something like that.

28:32.120 --> 28:34.760
Anyway, I need to read the rest of the comment is very important.

28:34.760 --> 28:35.760
I need to read it.

28:35.760 --> 28:38.500
And VG Realness says, fuck Apple, fuck Google, fuck Epic.

28:38.500 --> 28:43.320
Rich companies whining and complaining to be more rich, making us fight their battles.

28:43.320 --> 28:46.800
Meanwhile, the cops who killed Breonna Taylor are still free.

28:46.840 --> 28:49.940
My point, there are bigger issues in life at the moment.

28:49.940 --> 28:52.460
Absolutely a hundred percent true.

28:52.460 --> 28:58.040
It is disgusting that there have been no charges brought up against the cops who murdered Breonna

28:58.040 --> 28:59.600
Taylor.

28:59.600 --> 29:08.360
However, games sometimes, I think we can still separate that games and gaming and video games

29:08.360 --> 29:13.000
also kind of exist to give us an escape of all these shitty things that are going on

29:13.000 --> 29:14.360
in the real world.

29:14.360 --> 29:18.640
That doesn't mean to ignore it, to be ignorant of it or forget it.

29:18.640 --> 29:24.400
But for example, I know with this whole COVID-19 and in quarantine and being isolated, staying

29:24.400 --> 29:29.360
at home and all this stuff, you know, I've been battling quarantine related depression

29:29.360 --> 29:34.060
things and video games are a really good escape from all that.

29:34.060 --> 29:40.680
At the end of the day, I can also see the point where it's like, fuck all of these companies.

29:40.680 --> 29:42.440
They're all in it for themselves.

29:42.440 --> 29:43.440
They win.

29:43.440 --> 29:44.440
News.

29:44.440 --> 29:46.360
What the fuck ever happens, happens.

29:46.360 --> 29:51.040
I totally get that perspective and it's honestly kind of like where my head is at.

29:51.040 --> 29:57.060
However, I think it is kind of worth looking at what is that going to look like if Epic

29:57.060 --> 30:01.440
wins this and now the Epic Game Store is something that's available on iOS.

30:01.440 --> 30:03.300
Is that something that interests you?

30:03.300 --> 30:06.740
And my answer is hell no, because the Epic Game Store doesn't really interest me on the

30:06.740 --> 30:11.320
PC right now outside of the free games and all the fucking exclusives that they get,

30:11.320 --> 30:14.840
which kind of forced me to buy certain things on their store, which I really don't like

30:14.840 --> 30:15.960
doing.

30:15.960 --> 30:19.160
I've bought one game on their store and it's Tetris Effect.

30:19.160 --> 30:23.580
So anyway, let's see.

30:23.580 --> 30:28.080
Run John Stomp, excuse me, in chat says, I don't care what happens to Fortnite.

30:28.080 --> 30:33.000
I just want Epic Games to push Apple to change some rules because that means cloud gaming

30:33.000 --> 30:35.680
has a better chance of happening on my iPad.

30:35.680 --> 30:39.860
And again, I'm with you where I think that's the rule that needs to change.

30:39.860 --> 30:44.220
But my gut kind of tells me it will, because it did for Netflix.

30:44.220 --> 30:45.920
It did for Spotify.

30:45.920 --> 30:49.300
It did for that email app that was recently in the news.

30:49.300 --> 30:50.300
What was it?

30:50.300 --> 30:52.940
Hey, you're someone I'm sorry, I forget the name, but some some email app went to battle

30:52.940 --> 30:54.400
with Apple on that, too.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.600
And I think ultimately, that's where this ends up, too.

30:56.600 --> 31:01.220
I think the cloud gaming apps will happen on iOS.

31:01.220 --> 31:02.700
Am I being stupidly optimistic?

31:02.700 --> 31:03.700
Maybe.

31:03.700 --> 31:06.100
But I just kind of think the track record is there.

31:06.100 --> 31:10.060
But I do think the storefront and who gets the 30% cut and so forth will end up being

31:10.060 --> 31:12.060
a different issue.

31:12.060 --> 31:15.940
Let's see.

31:15.940 --> 31:17.280
Let's see.

31:17.280 --> 31:22.580
Bobby Black Wolf says, I platinumed Persona 5 Royal after 124 hours to battle quarantine

31:22.580 --> 31:23.580
depression.

31:23.580 --> 31:26.640
Note, I do not actually have medical depression, which is a real thing.

31:26.640 --> 31:28.380
I'm just depressed as an emotion.

31:28.380 --> 31:29.420
Yeah, same.

31:29.420 --> 31:31.380
I'm not saying I was diagnosed or anything like that.

31:31.380 --> 31:32.380
I'm not here to belittle.

31:32.380 --> 31:33.700
You all know what I mean.

31:34.420 --> 31:39.420
We've all got the feels during these events and so forth and video games can be a great

31:39.420 --> 31:40.820
escape for that.

31:40.820 --> 31:44.900
But again, don't be ignorant to everything else going on in the world.

31:44.900 --> 31:45.900
Y'all better be.

31:45.900 --> 31:48.540
Y'all better be figuring out how you're going to vote in the US.

31:48.540 --> 31:51.820
Y'all better figure out how you can be voting in November, because it sounds like they're

31:51.820 --> 31:54.060
going to try to make it as difficult as possible.

31:54.060 --> 31:58.460
So I'd care a little bit more if they said, oh, hey, we're just trying to earn some additional

31:58.460 --> 32:03.260
money so we can donate that all to the US Postal Service to keep that thing afloat.

32:03.260 --> 32:06.220
But yeah, it's just going in their pockets.

32:06.220 --> 32:08.340
Well fucking said, to be honest.

32:08.340 --> 32:09.340
All right.

32:09.340 --> 32:10.340
Yes.

32:10.340 --> 32:14.060
If Epic said, you know what, we're doing this because we want to donate the extra money

32:14.060 --> 32:18.380
to the US Postal Service, I think this we would be having a completely different discussion

32:18.380 --> 32:19.380
right now.

32:19.380 --> 32:20.380
But they're not.

32:20.380 --> 32:24.940
They're going to be having discussions like you can't get changed just by, you know, pissing

32:24.940 --> 32:27.360
somebody off and then filing a lawsuit about it.

32:27.360 --> 32:32.020
You need to like just partner with these guys and like have a discussion about what you

32:32.020 --> 32:34.200
want to do.

32:34.200 --> 32:36.060
Maybe they've tried that and it hasn't gone their way.

32:36.060 --> 32:42.780
But like, I don't think at the end of this, I mean, like with on the Google side of things,

32:42.780 --> 32:49.580
because we've been focusing a lot on Apple, but like, I don't know, not that I'm saying

32:49.580 --> 32:57.500
that it would be advantageous for them to, for Epic to try to get say Fortnite on, I

32:57.500 --> 32:59.580
don't know, Stadia.

32:59.580 --> 33:05.340
But like if that was something that they were thinking about doing, I think that kind of

33:05.340 --> 33:07.860
burned their bridge there with that.

33:07.860 --> 33:08.860
I don't know.

33:08.860 --> 33:14.820
It's just, it seems kind of silly that this may not work out for them.

33:14.820 --> 33:16.060
It might not.

33:16.060 --> 33:19.220
And I think one other thing I want to make sure we say before we get into our gaming

33:19.220 --> 33:23.180
weeks on this whole topic, because I can't totally speak for Loki, but I have an idea.

33:23.180 --> 33:28.540
This is where his head is at on this as well, is that if it sounds like we're really irritated

33:28.540 --> 33:34.380
with Epic in this whole situation, like it's not necessarily the fact that they're pushing

33:34.380 --> 33:38.180
back on Apple's rules because people are always doing it.

33:38.180 --> 33:41.820
Like I said, and when it comes to the cloud gaming issues, Spotify has done it, Netflix

33:41.820 --> 33:46.120
has done it, or cloud based services issue, Netflix has done it, et cetera, et cetera.

33:46.120 --> 33:50.360
Like it's not the fact that they're making a legal issue out of it or whatever.

33:50.360 --> 34:04.400
It's the fucking propaganda and how they're trying to weaponize gamers, which are not

34:04.400 --> 34:09.160
usually the most pleasant crowd on social media to begin with.

34:09.160 --> 34:14.280
And I think gamers on social media, and I'm not talking about the vast majority of people

34:14.280 --> 34:18.400
that listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because you guys have been really cool in your comments,

34:18.400 --> 34:26.560
but I think y'all know when you go into very large gaming chat rooms and you watch events

34:26.560 --> 34:32.300
and you see things on social media, you see a lot of negativity, you see a lot of anger,

34:32.300 --> 34:34.360
you see a lot of bullshit.

34:34.360 --> 34:40.700
And I think that's what's really irritating about this is that Epic is trying to weaponize

34:40.700 --> 34:43.760
that bullshit.

34:43.760 --> 34:48.940
And that's the part where I'm just like, this is so transparent.

34:48.940 --> 34:52.940
I'm like, I'm offended almost, almost.

34:52.940 --> 34:59.180
So would be, I mean, not, not the judge people, but I would assume like a lot of the Fortnite

34:59.180 --> 35:02.640
players out there are probably younger.

35:02.640 --> 35:06.200
Do they, do they know what 1984 is?

35:06.200 --> 35:07.920
Do they even know who George Orwell is?

35:07.920 --> 35:09.880
Are they still forced to read that in high school?

35:09.880 --> 35:10.880
I don't know.

35:11.880 --> 35:18.320
Cause I can't imagine like, you know, when you're asking them on retaliation of, you

35:18.320 --> 35:21.640
know, was Epic Games to defy the App Store monopoly.

35:21.640 --> 35:23.880
Okay, dude, come on.

35:23.880 --> 35:29.680
And is this going to fight the top 20, 20 from becoming 1984, dude, if they were talking

35:29.680 --> 35:35.620
about like, you know, Facebook and you know, all these other like social media platforms

35:35.620 --> 35:40.280
tracking your, your movements and stuff like that, I might be more on board.

35:40.280 --> 35:45.760
But like, because you can't get a few extra percentage points out of, you know, your App

35:45.760 --> 35:46.760
Store purchases.

35:46.760 --> 35:47.760
I'm sorry.

35:47.760 --> 35:51.120
That's not quite the same.

35:51.120 --> 35:53.400
Oh, Big Brother.

35:53.400 --> 35:54.520
I love that show.

35:54.520 --> 36:02.960
Stan Janelle, SSJ100 Matt says, ask the people dealing with crunch time working on Fortnite

36:02.960 --> 36:05.080
how much this matters to them.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.080
Yeah.

36:06.080 --> 36:07.080
Yeah.

36:07.080 --> 36:10.280
How many, how many crunch hours did it take to put up that trailer?

36:13.280 --> 36:14.280
That's it.

36:14.280 --> 36:15.280
That's it.

36:15.280 --> 36:16.280
Just, just like that.

36:16.280 --> 36:17.760
Just leave that and leave the room.

36:17.760 --> 36:18.760
That's all you need.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.000
That's, that was fucking great.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
All right.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.920
Uh, let's, let's get into other gaming news and talk.

36:24.920 --> 36:28.880
We'll see where this goes, but since it's legal, it's not going to go anywhere fast.

36:28.880 --> 36:29.880
That's for sure.

36:29.880 --> 36:30.880
So we'll move on.

36:30.880 --> 36:34.360
Let's talk about other things like how was our gaming week and what are the types of

36:34.360 --> 36:36.280
video games that we have been playing this week?

36:36.480 --> 36:38.440
Ricky, how was your gaming week?

36:38.440 --> 36:43.200
So, um, I played a few things this week, so I played a whole ton of Orna because I took

36:43.200 --> 36:48.060
a road trip down to the Bay area this week, um, to go visit my grandparents.

36:48.060 --> 36:53.840
So, uh, I wasn't driving the car this time, so I got to try to capture all of the territories

36:53.840 --> 36:57.840
between here and Santa Clara.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.680
Um, so it was great.

36:59.680 --> 37:05.960
I like a few hundred, uh, probably like 150 to 200 new explored territories, um, because

37:05.960 --> 37:09.880
Orna unlike, you know, like Pokemon Go and Ingress and stuff will let you play quite

37:09.880 --> 37:11.360
a bit when the car is moving.

37:11.360 --> 37:13.360
So it's, it worked out great.

37:13.360 --> 37:20.880
Uh, so I did that and then, um, I played a little bit, uh, my kids actually made me play

37:20.880 --> 37:26.840
a bit of, um, Paper Mario and the Origami King cause I had to do boss fights and stuff.

37:26.840 --> 37:30.760
So I got to play against the second boss, which is great.

37:30.760 --> 37:32.960
And um, what else?

37:32.960 --> 37:35.080
I think I played a little bit of Minecraft this week.

37:35.080 --> 37:40.440
Um, I've been doing like kind of game dev tutorials, um, most of the week.

37:40.440 --> 37:41.440
That's what I've been working on.

37:41.440 --> 37:46.680
Uh, so a little, a little different than the usual stuff I've been messing with.

37:46.680 --> 37:52.160
I, um, took up some new programs and stuff to learn those, but yeah, that's pretty much

37:52.160 --> 37:53.160
it.

37:53.160 --> 37:54.160
All right.

37:54.560 --> 37:55.560
My gaming week.

37:55.560 --> 37:59.160
So I've been playing a lot of the same old stables, um, still playing Final Fantasy

37:59.160 --> 38:02.520
14, a brand new content patch was released this week.

38:02.520 --> 38:08.120
The big, uh, update we've been waiting for 5.3 just came out that actually kind of bookends

38:08.120 --> 38:10.780
the Shadowbringers expansion story.

38:10.780 --> 38:15.120
This patch was delayed a little bit because of COVID, um, I guess Square in Japan had

38:15.120 --> 38:18.040
some difficulty with transitioning to the work at home thing.

38:18.040 --> 38:20.240
Um, it just set them behind schedule a little bit.

38:20.240 --> 38:22.080
So this patch has been a long time coming.

38:22.120 --> 38:24.840
Uh, but it showed up this week and it's, it's really good.

38:24.840 --> 38:29.800
Like from a story perspective, it's really, really good and really cements the Shadowbringers

38:29.800 --> 38:35.440
story and really all of the Final Fantasy 14 expansions as just one of the best JRPG

38:35.440 --> 38:37.000
stories that's out there right now.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.480
Now of course there's that whole problem about the monthly fee and I understand that's what

38:40.480 --> 38:42.080
turns people off to it.

38:42.080 --> 38:47.200
The good news is though, for what it's worth, um, this patch did also make the free to play

38:47.200 --> 38:49.720
experience a lot more robust.

38:49.760 --> 38:54.800
You can now play the first two, and there's four all together Final Fantasy 14 expansions,

38:54.800 --> 38:56.680
you can play the first two for free.

38:56.680 --> 39:00.280
They let you go all the way to level 60 and basically everything with Heaven's Word you

39:00.280 --> 39:01.460
can do for free.

39:01.460 --> 39:05.960
Now you can't really join free companies, you can't do things that they're worried about

39:05.960 --> 39:10.880
guild sellers, explore, um, gold sellers, whatever, exploiting free accounts.

39:10.880 --> 39:14.240
There's still, a lot of that is still shut off and so, you know, obviously the other

39:14.240 --> 39:17.920
day they want to make money, uh, but there's still an awful lot you can do for free.

39:17.960 --> 39:23.840
However, I'm hearing that like, if you played A Realm Were Born and then you stopped, I'm

39:23.840 --> 39:27.800
hearing some of those people are having a real hard time coming back for the free to

39:27.800 --> 39:28.800
play thing.

39:28.800 --> 39:33.480
I don't know all the ins and outs of how that works, or what have you, I'm just hearing

39:33.480 --> 39:35.920
it's a little bit headachy.

39:35.920 --> 39:40.040
But for people that have not played 14 at all, there is that opportunity and Heaven's

39:40.040 --> 39:43.820
Word was a great story, so I think it's pretty cool.

39:43.820 --> 39:48.300
But yeah, I really enjoyed the latest patch, obviously I'm not going to spoil anything,

39:48.300 --> 39:52.700
but I thought it really wrapped everything up very nicely, it was very movie-like and

39:52.700 --> 39:54.020
very well done.

39:54.020 --> 39:59.460
So um, yeah, kudos to the Final Fantasy 14 team, they're continuing to develop a phenomenal

39:59.460 --> 40:01.220
game, that's for sure.

40:01.220 --> 40:06.140
Other games I've been playing this week, still the same old GPS stuff, like Pokemon Go, I

40:06.140 --> 40:12.180
have done so much remote raiding in Pokemon Go, I'm almost embarrassed to say how many

40:12.180 --> 40:17.420
of those stupid coins I've spent on remote raid passes, well, it's not a crazy amount,

40:17.420 --> 40:23.020
but it's a few, trying to get like a shiny Genesect, and I still don't have one.

40:23.020 --> 40:28.500
I did like another five fights today, I get a lot of like random invites, I'm very lucky,

40:28.500 --> 40:32.460
and I've been taking them up on some of them, like if I see them pop up in time, I'll try

40:32.460 --> 40:37.500
to join in, and if I have the pass, I'll join in and do the remote raid, but I love what

40:37.500 --> 40:39.560
remote raiding's done to the game.

40:39.560 --> 40:45.280
This made it a lot easier to get a group together to do a fight, and I hope it stays long past

40:45.280 --> 40:48.400
this COVID thing, and I think it's going to, I think they're going to cap how many people

40:48.400 --> 40:52.000
can do it, but you should still be able to get a minimal group together to take down

40:52.000 --> 40:56.160
any raid boss with those remote raid passes, and I think that's going to be a really good

40:56.160 --> 40:57.160
thing.

40:57.160 --> 40:59.040
So, very cool.

40:59.040 --> 41:04.960
Sorry, I'm backtracking a little bit, but this is very important, Bobby in chat says,

41:04.960 --> 41:18.680
See, that's, that's dumb on Square's part, and World of Warcraft doesn't do that, theirs

41:18.680 --> 41:26.120
is a little bit stronger in that regard, so, I would say the two things holding Final Fantasy

41:26.120 --> 41:32.120
XIV back right now, their archaic storefront, and this is an example of that, and their

41:32.120 --> 41:37.000
archaic server structure, which WoW is ahead of them in that regard.

41:37.000 --> 41:41.040
Those are the two, like, negative things I'll say about Final Fantasy XIV that I really

41:41.040 --> 41:42.800
would like to see them work on.

41:42.800 --> 41:46.880
Love the game, love the product, they really need to work on those two things.

41:46.880 --> 41:52.580
The dumb storefront, and the dumb server structure that doesn't make me, doesn't let me play

41:52.580 --> 41:56.280
with my friends in the US because they picked it at different data center.

41:56.280 --> 41:58.760
Like we're past that, WoW has shown that.

41:58.760 --> 42:04.080
SHG100Matt says, Rob sent me a raid invite last night, it was close to midnight here

42:04.080 --> 42:06.920
on the east coast, so yeah, remote raid is great.

42:06.920 --> 42:10.880
Yeah, you can do the, I got a raid invite in Germany today, that I was doing at like

42:10.880 --> 42:13.040
10am, so that was kind of fun.

42:13.040 --> 42:18.200
And it's neat because if you catch the Pokemon it shows, well actually no, my geotags disappeared

42:18.200 --> 42:23.120
but it used to show, like this Genesect is from Germany or whatever, so it's kind of

42:23.120 --> 42:27.040
fun catching them all from around the world thanks to remote passes.

42:27.040 --> 42:31.320
The other game I've been playing this week, Fall Guys, which you know, it's free on

42:31.320 --> 42:35.600
PlayStation Plus, free with gold, and it's also available on Steam.

42:35.600 --> 42:40.820
Alan has really gotten into Fall Guys on Steam, and I played a little bit on PlayStation 4,

42:40.820 --> 42:44.540
and I think it's great because it's that whole battle royale thing but it's not a

42:44.540 --> 42:45.540
shooty shooty bang bang.

42:45.540 --> 42:49.560
Oh yeah, that was the other thing, I forgot I played Fall Guys this week as well, that

42:49.560 --> 42:51.360
was something I played quite a bit of as well.

42:51.360 --> 42:52.360
Oh yeah?

42:52.360 --> 42:54.020
What do you think of Fall Guys?

42:54.020 --> 42:57.580
It's alright, sometimes it can be a little bit frustrating with the controls, but overall

42:57.580 --> 42:59.620
it's been pretty decent.

42:59.620 --> 43:03.900
I just wish the controls are a little bit tighter so that it's not so much like I'm

43:03.900 --> 43:08.900
falling over, I mean I get it, Fall Guys ha, but like I wish it wasn't that I was falling

43:08.900 --> 43:15.060
over all the time, you know, more skill based, like I can actually be able to run this stuff

43:15.060 --> 43:20.540
a little bit easier, but I mean it is what it is, it's fine.

43:20.540 --> 43:21.540
It's pretty fun.

43:22.060 --> 43:24.780
Anyway, I don't want to duplicate myself too much because I'm pretty sure I talked about

43:24.780 --> 43:28.700
this game last week because I remember saying this game when it comes out on the Switch

43:28.700 --> 43:33.380
is going to be the game, and I think that's just a matter of time when that happens and

43:33.380 --> 43:37.900
I still stand by that, but Fall Guys is fun for sure, so.

43:37.900 --> 43:42.340
No One Special 77 in chat says, seems like every Tom, Dick, and Harry plus their long

43:42.340 --> 43:47.460
dead granny, that's quite a mouthful, is streaming Fall Guys on Twitch, from what I've seen it

43:47.460 --> 43:50.020
looks like Mario-less party.

43:50.020 --> 43:53.780
Well, Fall Guys also, if I'm not mistaken, they did a kind of campaign with some of the

43:53.780 --> 43:59.780
big streamers on Twitch to kind of bump themselves up in the rankings, but a lot of games do

43:59.780 --> 44:03.280
that and not all of them catch on, this one caught on.

44:03.280 --> 44:08.020
And I think it's just part of, I like the fact, you can play it in short, quick little

44:08.020 --> 44:12.760
matches, short little bursts, you can play it with friends, and I think it makes it an

44:12.760 --> 44:17.180
attractive game to stream, probably because it's very easy to understand what's going

44:17.180 --> 44:18.180
on.

44:18.180 --> 44:23.660
I don't always like to watch narrative streams being streamed on Twitch, and I stream a lot

44:23.660 --> 44:28.020
less of them myself, I'm not gonna say I'm never gonna do it, but I would probably always

44:28.020 --> 44:31.180
stream the beginning of it, I probably wouldn't stream midway, because I don't like to jump

44:31.180 --> 44:34.920
into a game like watching somebody do Paper Mario, I have a lot of friends that are streaming

44:34.920 --> 44:38.580
Paper Mario, I don't want to see the game halfway through, because A, it's kind of like

44:38.580 --> 44:42.500
spoiling part of the story, B, all the mechanics have already been explained and sometimes

44:42.500 --> 44:46.620
it's hard to understand what's going on, Fall Guys, it's very easy to understand what's

44:46.620 --> 44:47.940
going on.

44:47.940 --> 44:54.060
And I think that's what makes it really lucrative to stream, for sure.

44:54.060 --> 44:58.220
Pele Hanumea in chat says, I got my pineapple costume in Fall Guys, so I'm good.

44:58.220 --> 45:02.380
Yeah, some of the costumes are really funny, so I need to play more to get costumes.

45:02.380 --> 45:06.180
Alan, have you got any costumes in Fall Guys?

45:06.180 --> 45:10.580
I'm waiting to see what he says from the other room.

45:10.580 --> 45:14.060
He says as you play, you level up, even if you don't win.

45:14.060 --> 45:18.000
As you play, you level up, even if you don't win, and you just unlock stuff.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.260
So have you unlocked anything cool?

45:21.260 --> 45:24.860
He says, he's thinking, I got like a dinosaur.

45:24.860 --> 45:27.780
A dinosaur, okay, that's cool.

45:27.780 --> 45:31.900
Act Def says, there's an Enter the Gungeon costume right now on PlayStation 4.

45:31.900 --> 45:32.900
Nice.

45:32.900 --> 45:40.180
Yeah, and they're also doing a Team Fortress 2 skin as well, so I think the Scout.

45:40.180 --> 45:41.180
I think you're right.

45:41.300 --> 45:45.860
Anyway, that was pretty much it for my gaming week, so had fun there.

45:45.860 --> 45:48.260
I want to go out and do Orna and all that stuff too.

45:48.260 --> 45:49.260
It's too hot.

45:49.260 --> 45:53.440
I haven't played Ingress in the past two days just because of the weather.

45:53.440 --> 45:57.940
It's too much, and I'm at the point where I'm like, if the other team is going to field

45:57.940 --> 46:02.020
right now, I can't be bothered.

46:02.020 --> 46:07.060
They want it more if they're going to play in this heat, because it is insane right now.

46:07.060 --> 46:08.500
And that's kind of where I'm at with Pokemon Go.

46:08.500 --> 46:14.220
They did the Pokemon Go Community Day Makeup, or sorry, Pokemon Go Fest Makeup was today.

46:14.220 --> 46:16.180
I didn't go outside for that, hell no.

46:16.180 --> 46:22.780
But I did Incense on the couch, and I didn't catch anything that spectacular, but I tried.

46:22.780 --> 46:24.780
But I wasn't going to go outside and play.

46:24.780 --> 46:26.260
It's too hot.

46:26.260 --> 46:27.260
It's still hot.

46:27.260 --> 46:32.220
My watch says it is still 105 degrees outside, and it's not even 7 o'clock.

46:32.220 --> 46:34.820
This is Phoenix-style weather going on right here.

46:34.820 --> 46:37.180
All right, anyhow, let's move on.

46:37.180 --> 46:39.960
Let's get into some news, some other things going on in the gaming world.

46:39.960 --> 46:43.020
So Loki, why don't you start us off?

46:43.020 --> 46:47.260
The Xbox Series X is going to be coming out later this year, so we know now which month.

46:47.260 --> 46:50.300
That's going to be November.

46:50.300 --> 46:52.820
Now one thing that is from November.

46:52.820 --> 46:56.020
Did we ever doubt that it wasn't going to be November?

46:56.020 --> 46:58.020
It could have been October.

46:58.020 --> 47:02.640
All right, all right, all right.

47:02.640 --> 47:08.520
So anyways, it's going to be coming out, but Sans Halo Infinite, unfortunately Halo Infinite

47:08.520 --> 47:16.760
has been delayed to 2021, I'm sure partially because of the reactions to the gameplay trailer

47:16.760 --> 47:21.920
that they had that were less than preferred.

47:21.920 --> 47:26.740
But they did say that there's going to be 50 new games that are playing to launch this

47:26.740 --> 47:31.600
year across generations, and they'll be optimized for Xbox Series X.

47:31.600 --> 47:38.300
And also, I think they said a total of 1,000 games across four generations of consoles.

47:38.300 --> 47:41.720
So lots of stuff with Game Pass and all that.

47:41.720 --> 47:44.000
So we'll see.

47:44.000 --> 47:48.320
I'm excited about it, but Halo Infinite not coming out, it's not a deal breaker for me.

47:48.320 --> 47:53.980
I'm not a huge Halo fan, but I would prefer that they polish it so it doesn't look like

47:53.980 --> 47:54.980
it did.

47:54.980 --> 47:55.980
Yeah.

47:55.980 --> 47:58.140
I already kind of made my thoughts on Halo known.

47:58.140 --> 47:59.520
I am a Halo fan.

47:59.520 --> 48:01.280
I've maybe fallen out of favor a little bit.

48:01.280 --> 48:05.180
Like it's kind of lost me a little bit with some of the newer titles, but I was a fan

48:05.180 --> 48:08.460
of the fact that they're going for a more classic looking Halo game.

48:08.460 --> 48:12.520
I'm enticed by the fact it sounds like they might put a battle royale, because I think

48:12.520 --> 48:15.520
the multiplayer in Halo is a lot of fun, even if I suck at it.

48:15.520 --> 48:18.160
I think a battle royale type mode could be a lot of fun.

48:18.160 --> 48:19.160
Note that that was never before.

48:19.160 --> 48:22.000
With the battle royale type mode that's in it, it's like Fall Guys.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
Yeah.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.220
Well, we'll see.

48:24.220 --> 48:27.420
There's some mechanic-y things in Halo too sometimes.

48:27.420 --> 48:28.420
So we'll see.

48:29.300 --> 48:32.060
At the end of the day, if the game's not ready, it's not ready.

48:32.060 --> 48:35.260
And for whatever reason they pushed it back, then yeah, push it back.

48:35.260 --> 48:36.580
Take the time you need.

48:36.580 --> 48:38.820
Still, it's a pretty shocking delay.

48:38.820 --> 48:42.820
I mean, that is like Nintendo pushing back a Mario game for launch or something.

48:42.820 --> 48:46.060
It's a huge title.

48:46.060 --> 48:47.400
Didn't they do that though?

48:47.400 --> 48:51.380
Was Mario Odyssey originally supposed to be a launch title or is that not?

48:51.380 --> 48:52.380
Maybe.

48:52.380 --> 48:53.380
I don't know.

48:53.380 --> 48:54.380
Maybe.

48:54.380 --> 48:55.380
You're probably right.

48:55.380 --> 48:56.380
Maybe.

48:56.380 --> 48:57.380
But they did have the Zelda.

48:57.380 --> 49:02.060
Although the Zelda came out on two systems, they really only advertised it for one.

49:02.060 --> 49:04.060
The Breath of the Wild.

49:04.060 --> 49:07.740
Assuming that Mario Odyssey was delayed, does anyone remember?

49:07.740 --> 49:08.740
No.

49:08.740 --> 49:12.060
Same thing when the Xbox Series X came out.

49:12.060 --> 49:15.780
Once it comes out, no one's going to remember that it was delayed or going to care.

49:15.780 --> 49:21.660
But it was supposed to be like a big thing to get a Series X for, so I do hope Microsoft

49:21.660 --> 49:27.260
has a long game plan or that they are adjusting their expectations for the holiday sales of

49:27.260 --> 49:30.100
the Series X accordingly.

49:30.100 --> 49:33.740
Maybe this is a blessing in disguise if there's going to be hardware manufacturing issues,

49:33.740 --> 49:36.060
although we haven't heard a lot about that or anything.

49:36.060 --> 49:38.300
So I mean, we'll see.

49:38.300 --> 49:44.100
But I'm kind of curious to see what Xbox Series X is going to look like in that launch window.

49:44.100 --> 49:46.820
Although I'm not going to lie, I'm probably still going to get one.

49:46.820 --> 49:47.820
Yeah.

49:47.820 --> 49:50.060
I mean, it's fine there.

49:50.060 --> 49:51.300
Hopefully there'll be other things.

49:51.300 --> 49:53.260
I know Games Pass will help.

49:53.260 --> 49:54.260
This is exactly it.

49:54.460 --> 50:00.580
Removing the cost of, say, Xbox Live Gold might even help more, but all in good time.

50:00.580 --> 50:01.580
All those announcements.

50:01.580 --> 50:02.580
We don't even know what cost yet.

50:02.580 --> 50:05.900
Yeah, because you might ask me, why are you going to get an Xbox Series X?

50:05.900 --> 50:08.700
The answer is Game Pass.

50:08.700 --> 50:10.640
Because there'll already be a ton of games to play.

50:10.640 --> 50:14.060
And then I'm not going to be able to get it through the iOS store because the launcher's

50:14.060 --> 50:18.900
been taken down, and how am I going to buy my console then?

50:18.900 --> 50:21.020
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, Animal Crossing was delayed.

50:21.020 --> 50:22.220
Smash Brothers was delayed.

50:22.220 --> 50:24.420
SJ100Matt says, Metroid Prime 4 was pushed.

50:24.420 --> 50:27.380
Yes, yes, and yes, none of those games launch titles.

50:27.380 --> 50:28.380
So that's the only thing.

50:28.380 --> 50:30.260
And I'm not saying I'm mad or anything.

50:30.260 --> 50:33.420
No, again, if they need to take the time to get it right, take time to get it right.

50:33.420 --> 50:37.700
But it's just interesting what's that going to do when that was the big anchor title I

50:37.700 --> 50:41.340
kind of thought as far as launching the system.

50:41.340 --> 50:46.020
It's just going to be interesting, and I hope Microsoft lowers their expectations accordingly.

50:46.020 --> 50:52.500
I would hate to see Microsoft write the Xbox Series X Office a failure when Halo wasn't

50:52.500 --> 50:55.180
there ready to go day one, and maybe it'll still do very well.

50:55.180 --> 50:56.180
I don't know.

50:56.180 --> 50:57.180
But we'll see.

50:57.180 --> 51:04.220
But I also think, again, if a lot of the strength of Microsoft can be measured in Game Pass,

51:04.220 --> 51:08.480
and how much of that they push on PC, and how much of that they push on console, whatever

51:08.480 --> 51:13.100
it is, I do think Microsoft will still make a lot of wins there.

51:13.100 --> 51:17.180
Microsoft has that flight simulator coming out this week, and that's going to be a big

51:17.180 --> 51:19.420
win for Game Pass, in my opinion, too.

51:19.420 --> 51:23.540
And I think a good reason to get Game Pass, because why pay all that money for a flight

51:23.540 --> 51:28.700
simulator when you, I think, isn't PC Game Pass like five bucks a month?

51:28.700 --> 51:31.180
Like it's pretty cheap.

51:31.180 --> 51:34.700
Don't know, because I think when you buy the one now, you get both.

51:34.700 --> 51:37.380
So I'm not sure if, maybe it's Games Pass Ultimate.

51:37.380 --> 51:38.380
I don't know.

51:38.380 --> 51:43.260
But yeah, I know it's less expensive, because there's less games available.

51:43.260 --> 51:50.500
I kind of wish that if I bought the PC one, I could stream all my Xbox games to the PC,

51:50.500 --> 51:54.020
since there's not all of them.

51:54.020 --> 51:57.860
That would definitely sell me one.

51:57.860 --> 52:02.420
S-H-O 100 Matt says, I would like to think anyone coming out with new tech in 2020 has

52:02.420 --> 52:03.420
expectations tempered.

52:03.420 --> 52:04.420
At least they should.

52:04.420 --> 52:05.420
True.

52:05.460 --> 52:10.020
Hani Hanumea says, total respect to Microsoft for courage to delay Halo.

52:10.020 --> 52:13.340
That's a really well said point, although isn't courage an Apple word?

52:13.340 --> 52:14.340
I'm just kidding.

52:14.340 --> 52:15.340
I had to.

52:15.340 --> 52:16.340
Cheap shot.

52:16.340 --> 52:17.340
I had to take it.

52:17.340 --> 52:21.860
V.G. Realness says, not sure if it was already stated, but what is Sony really launching

52:21.860 --> 52:26.300
with anyways, besides Miles Morales, which is also PlayStation 4?

52:26.300 --> 52:29.700
That is a damn good question, and we don't know.

52:29.700 --> 52:32.240
And that is one that Sony, I think, should answer as well.

52:32.240 --> 52:37.200
So it could be very interesting that on both sides of the house, Microsoft and Sony, we

52:37.200 --> 52:45.640
might see, I don't want to say weak lineups, but maybe lineups different than what we've

52:45.640 --> 52:47.920
seen in the past.

52:47.920 --> 52:53.160
But I think we're also going to see a big lenience, especially on Microsoft's side,

52:53.160 --> 52:58.800
of play the games you already know the best on this new system.

52:58.800 --> 53:02.420
And I think that's going to be a huge part of Microsoft's messaging since PlayStation

53:02.420 --> 53:06.040
still not talking about backwards compatibility, really.

53:06.040 --> 53:07.040
We don't know.

53:07.040 --> 53:08.600
But a lot can change in the next month.

53:08.600 --> 53:13.560
But I think big moves are going to have to start happening this month.

53:13.560 --> 53:14.880
It's mid-August.

53:14.880 --> 53:20.280
So I really I would have thought before Labor Day was kind of like the deadline for Sony

53:20.280 --> 53:24.540
and Microsoft to lay bare what is the launch day going to look like.

53:24.540 --> 53:26.440
But maybe they're going to cut it closer.

53:26.440 --> 53:27.440
I don't know.

53:27.440 --> 53:33.280
And to invoke Apple, Apple can do a huge fucking event and be like, there's a brand new phone

53:33.280 --> 53:37.420
in three days and it'll still sell cuckoo bananas.

53:37.420 --> 53:41.160
So that might not be a good idea in the state of our postal.

53:41.160 --> 53:47.800
Well, not necessarily the post office, but like even UPS and FedEx and all of those companies

53:47.800 --> 53:51.920
are very backlogged as far as what's being delivered.

53:51.920 --> 53:55.640
Perhaps not the best time to hold off your preorders, you know, or like even shipments

53:55.640 --> 53:56.640
for that stuff.

53:56.640 --> 54:02.920
In fact, we had a recent story that one of the UPS facilities in California was putting

54:02.920 --> 54:06.140
things in the pile instead of delivering them.

54:06.140 --> 54:08.920
So I don't know.

54:08.920 --> 54:12.880
I would rather we know the information sooner than later, but I know that they're waiting.

54:12.880 --> 54:14.840
They want to counter Sony on that stuff.

54:14.840 --> 54:21.120
And once again, billion dollar companies fighting over billions of dollars.

54:21.120 --> 54:25.520
VG Realness and chat says it seems like both launches are going to be lackluster.

54:25.520 --> 54:29.880
They should just both delay and call it a day since they can't seem to pick a date and

54:29.880 --> 54:35.320
price playing this bullshit capped cat and mouse game.

54:35.320 --> 54:38.600
And that's shown under Matt piggybacks off that to say something similar to what you

54:38.600 --> 54:39.640
just said.

54:39.640 --> 54:45.060
And again, another situation where two companies are playing chicken about announcing the price.

54:45.060 --> 54:47.880
We consumers are stuck in the middle of it.

54:47.880 --> 54:53.320
So here we just why don't let's let's bring Sony and Microsoft into the room.

54:53.320 --> 54:54.320
Okay, walk in.

54:54.320 --> 54:55.320
Okay.

54:55.320 --> 54:56.320
Fuck you.

54:56.320 --> 54:57.320
Fuck you.

54:57.320 --> 54:58.320
Fuck you.

54:58.320 --> 54:59.320
Fuck you.

54:59.320 --> 55:03.840
Well, also playing cat and mouse with the price of a system during the nation's greatest

55:03.840 --> 55:05.760
recession in history.

55:05.760 --> 55:09.480
I mean, or what's going to be probably the greatest recession.

55:09.480 --> 55:13.920
Yeah, I don't think technically the recession hasn't hit levels of like, let's say the 1930s

55:13.920 --> 55:19.840
or the the last one we had in the aughts, but at the time of this thing, yeah, fair.

55:19.840 --> 55:20.840
All right.

55:20.840 --> 55:22.220
Let's move on, shall we?

55:23.180 --> 55:26.260
Let's talk about a game you're not going to be able to buy on the new console.

55:26.260 --> 55:29.060
And that is Forza Horizon 3.

55:29.060 --> 55:33.740
Forza Horizon 3 is being moved to an end of life status, meaning it will no longer be

55:33.740 --> 55:36.120
on sale after September.

55:36.120 --> 55:38.660
So Forza Horizon 3 came out in 2016.

55:38.660 --> 55:41.660
It's done very well critically.

55:41.660 --> 55:42.860
And it's a good fucking game.

55:42.860 --> 55:43.860
I own it.

55:43.860 --> 55:44.860
I'm a fan.

55:44.860 --> 55:46.860
I love the Forza Horizon series.

55:46.900 --> 55:52.300
I think it's one of Microsoft's strongest titles, especially when it comes to exclusives.

55:52.300 --> 55:57.740
I can't fucking wait until they announce Forza 5 for the Xbox Series X, because it seems

55:57.740 --> 55:59.620
like that will happen eventually.

55:59.620 --> 56:00.620
But of course, you have this whole...

56:00.620 --> 56:01.620
Horizon 5.

56:01.620 --> 56:02.620
What's that?

56:02.620 --> 56:03.620
Did I say...

56:03.620 --> 56:04.620
Forza Horizon 5.

56:04.620 --> 56:05.620
You know what I meant.

56:05.620 --> 56:08.320
Forza Horizon 5 for the Series X.

56:08.320 --> 56:11.980
But of course, we have this whole interesting thing now where that same studio did so fucking

56:11.980 --> 56:15.100
well with Forza Horizon, now they're doing Fable.

56:15.100 --> 56:18.820
So you know, now I might kind of have to wait a little bit.

56:18.820 --> 56:22.340
But anyway, Forza Horizon 3 not going to be available anymore.

56:22.340 --> 56:25.360
And this is likely due to licensing agreements.

56:25.360 --> 56:28.060
They do have music that plays during the game and so forth.

56:28.060 --> 56:33.660
And sometimes, as opposed to patching it out, it's just easier to not sell it anymore.

56:33.660 --> 56:40.240
The same thing happened to Forza Horizon 2, by the way, which was an Xbox One launch title.

56:40.240 --> 56:47.040
If memory serves me right, I believe it was released on the 360 and the Xbox One, that

56:47.040 --> 56:48.040
same holiday.

56:48.040 --> 56:51.000
And that was delisted in 2018.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.520
And that's interesting, because that would be the same timeframe.

56:53.520 --> 56:55.960
That would be, what, about four years since launch.

56:55.960 --> 57:00.640
So whatever licensing agreements or whatever was in place must expire.

57:00.640 --> 57:09.040
So Horizon 3, no longer available in September 27.

57:09.040 --> 57:11.520
That means all of the DLC as well.

57:11.520 --> 57:15.880
So if you want to get things like that hot, was it the Hot Wheels was in three?

57:15.880 --> 57:18.460
Hot Wheels is in three, Lego is in four, right?

57:18.460 --> 57:19.960
So yeah.

57:19.960 --> 57:24.600
So if you want to get that stuff, you got to get it because it's going to be going away.

57:24.600 --> 57:28.400
What I think is interesting about this, now games get delisted all the time.

57:28.400 --> 57:31.280
We don't necessarily see a first party game getting delisted.

57:31.280 --> 57:34.560
Oh, by the way, if you already own the game, you're going to be fine.

57:34.560 --> 57:38.240
If you need to re-download it because you own it, you're fine.

57:38.240 --> 57:42.860
If you have a disc version, you're buying it used to GameStop or whatever, you're fine.

57:42.860 --> 57:47.720
It's just you can no longer buy a new copy on the marketplace.

57:47.720 --> 57:51.680
But I think what's interesting about this is that I would have considered the Horizon

57:51.680 --> 57:55.200
series one of the great things about Game Pass.

57:55.200 --> 57:58.840
And so it is interesting because I've always just assumed, oh, Game Pass is just going

57:58.840 --> 58:01.820
to have all the first person Microsoft titles.

58:01.820 --> 58:04.740
But sometimes those titles are going to get sunsetted.

58:04.740 --> 58:06.860
And not everything first party is available yet.

58:06.860 --> 58:13.220
And maybe some of the tricky licensing agreements are part of the reason why.

58:13.220 --> 58:18.600
Now for what it's worth, Forza Horizon 2, I distinctly remember was a games with gold

58:18.600 --> 58:21.180
game right before it went away.

58:21.180 --> 58:23.340
So a lot of people had a chance to grab it.

58:23.340 --> 58:27.940
And so hopefully they'll do the same thing with Horizon 3 next month.

58:27.940 --> 58:31.820
It's going to have to be next month because it goes away at the end of September.

58:31.820 --> 58:32.820
But we'll see.

58:32.820 --> 58:33.820
They haven't announced that yet.

58:33.900 --> 58:35.100
But it is a sale.

58:35.100 --> 58:39.940
You can get it like 67% off, which I think, what, like $9.99 or something like that is

58:39.940 --> 58:40.940
the price of the game right now.

58:40.940 --> 58:41.940
It's pretty cheap.

58:41.940 --> 58:43.940
It's a damn good racing game again.

58:43.940 --> 58:48.260
If you haven't tried the Horizon series, give it a go.

58:48.260 --> 58:49.420
It's not a simulator.

58:49.420 --> 58:52.680
It's an arcade style racer and it works very well.

58:52.680 --> 58:54.380
So I'm a big fan.

58:54.380 --> 58:57.300
So check that out.

58:57.300 --> 58:58.300
Let's move on with our next story.

58:58.300 --> 58:59.300
Loki.

58:59.780 --> 59:07.180
Alright, so we talked a little bit about Xbox and PlayStation both getting a lot of games

59:07.180 --> 59:10.700
that are being upgraded to next gen for free.

59:10.700 --> 59:16.700
So unfortunately, one of these games that's not going to necessarily be upgraded is Control.

59:16.700 --> 59:21.780
So Control, the original game, came out quite a while ago.

59:21.780 --> 59:27.780
And now what they're doing instead is they're only going to be upgrading the ultimate edition

59:27.780 --> 59:28.780
of Control.

59:29.740 --> 59:32.300
So in order to get that, you have to pay $40.

59:32.300 --> 59:37.140
It's basically kind of the sort of game of the year edition of Control with the DLC thrown

59:37.140 --> 59:38.140
in there.

59:38.140 --> 59:42.380
But it's going to, that version will be upgraded, but not the original version.

59:42.380 --> 59:45.980
So not only people that paid full price for that are getting a little bit penalized, especially

59:45.980 --> 59:50.260
if you bought the DLC for it as well, but in order to get it to play on the PlayStation

59:50.260 --> 59:56.020
5 or Xbox Series X, you have to purchase it again for $40, which is kind of ridiculous.

59:56.020 --> 59:58.020
I'm not sure why they would do that.

59:58.460 --> 59:59.980
That's the choice that they made.

59:59.980 --> 01:00:00.980
Yeah.

01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:05.180
I mean, it really depends how much they're putting into it because, you know, like take

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:07.300
a game like Saints Row the Third, right?

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:11.100
They just recently did that whole new remaster and you didn't get it for free, right?

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:16.260
You had to rebuy the game, but you got a remastered product.

01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:17.460
It looks a lot different.

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:20.060
It looks a lot cleaner and so forth.

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:22.260
So some would argue it's worth it.

01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:27.420
So if they're going to be taking the type of time to make those same type of changes

01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:30.220
to control, then maybe it's a little more justified.

01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:35.220
But if it's just like, oh, it's just a port for PlayStation 5, then blah, you know?

01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:36.220
Yeah.

01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:45.100
But I mean, to argue, basically, if you're making the assets for one version of control,

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:49.940
it's really not going to cost you any more to upgrade both versions.

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:52.900
I mean, that would be the logical sense is, hey, you know what?

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:56.860
We're going to be upgrading this so that you can play it on the next gen consoles.

01:00:56.860 --> 01:01:00.220
And on top of that, if you haven't purchased it yet, you can get it for 40 bucks.

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:01.660
It's at a discount.

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:06.100
That would make them kind of out to be like the good guys here, you know, offering a pretty

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:10.140
decent deal for those who might be excited to get into that now that we've seen, you

01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:12.740
know, some next gen footage of it or something.

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:16.700
But instead, they're paywalling it to try to I don't see how that's going to really

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:21.060
get people that own the original version of control to like, oh, well, I better jump on

01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:22.060
that.

01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:25.260
I mean, that's kind of ridiculous.

01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:26.700
They can definitely do that.

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:31.140
I don't think it's a good decision, but I think really they should do both versions

01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:32.900
that they're going to make the assets for it.

01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:37.180
They're not changing the engine it's running in and it's the same game just with the DLC

01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:38.180
thrown in.

01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:41.580
So you're making the assets for this version to be upgraded anyways.

01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:43.180
Why can't you do both?

01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:47.620
I honestly feel like control will be one of those things and this not to shade a game

01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:51.480
that honestly I haven't played and I need to because the studio always does make really

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:54.540
good games and control obviously got some very good reviews.

01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:55.920
It's like on my list.

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:57.820
You know what this news tells me?

01:01:57.820 --> 01:01:59.380
This news says up, stop.

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:00.420
Don't bother with it now.

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:04.080
Wait for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X at this point because you're wasting your time

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:05.080
doing it now.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:06.240
Or how about this?

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.240
You know what?

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:10.920
Oh, you want to you want me to pay another $40 for the ultimate edition?

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:11.920
No, thank you.

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.660
I'll just wait for it to go down to $5 or $19.99.

01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:19.180
That was exactly what I was going to say is that I feel like control on PS5 and Xbox Series

01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:25.000
X is going to be one of those things 90 days and it'll be half off if that 90 days out

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.640
and it'll be half off.

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:27.640
Just wait for sale.

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:30.200
I mean, I'm sorry.

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:31.920
It seems like double dipping.

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.140
I just don't get it.

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:38.080
It would be different if this was to your example of Saints Row.

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:40.480
Saints Row was a game that came out on PlayStation 3.

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:45.360
They remastered everything for the PlayStation 4 version and they put it on other systems

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.360
as well.

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:50.400
So they went in, they had to redo the whole engine, they had to upgrade all the visuals.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.480
That's different than say we're adding some additional features to make it look nicer

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:57.640
on the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5.

01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:00.840
They're not rebuilding the whole game from the ground up, I think.

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:06.460
But at the same time, there have been other things like Bioshock, that series.

01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:12.000
I want to say that they did free updates, remastered editions, if you will, for those

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.640
who already bought the original ones.

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:16.960
They didn't want to punish those people, but at the same time, they were also selling that

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.860
on its own.

01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:20.600
You know what y'all better be ready for?

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:22.240
You know what y'all better be ready for?

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:25.000
The same thing's going to happen with Final Fantasy 7 Remake.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Mark my words.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.160
It's going to happen with Final Fantasy 7 Remake.

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:30.400
It's not going to be a free upgrade, they're going to do a new.

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:35.280
And it'll all be timed with the exclusive window lapsing for PlayStation.

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:39.200
So there will be an Xbox Series X release, a PlayStation 5 release.

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.720
I almost said Nintendo Switch, but no.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.720
So there'll be a PlayStation 5 and maybe a PC, I don't know.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:50.320
But there'll be a release on all those platforms and it'll be some type of Uber edition that

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.720
has like an extra.

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:54.800
Maybe Red 13 will be playable.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:55.800
I don't know.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.500
But they're going to do like an extra something something to be like, oh, it's got something

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:05.480
new and make people buy it again in anticipation for when the second part of the remake story

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:08.240
comes out whenever that ends up being.

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:11.240
But I'm telling you, it's going to happen.

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:12.240
And that's fine.

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.240
I don't know.

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:14.240
I just.

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.240
It's whatever.

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:18.320
I mean, you know, vote with your wallet.

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:22.960
So if you think it's reasonable to purchase the original game and you really, really,

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:27.240
really want to get it, you know, for the next gen system, maybe you didn't buy the DLC for

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.240
it.

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:29.240
I mean, then fine.

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:30.240
Repurchase the game.

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:33.480
But like, if I wouldn't, I would just wait.

01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:38.360
I would seriously, especially if you if you have already purchased the game, then you

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:42.400
don't need to run out and purchase the game right away just to play it on another console.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:46.120
I'm assuming you probably have already played through the game as it is.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:50.420
And at that point, just wait, just go back and play the original version again.

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:55.880
Then again, you're talking to somebody who bought Mass Effect three, four times and is

01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:58.800
about ready to do a fifth time as soon as they announce that.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:01.000
But it wasn't on the same console, though.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
That wasn't the same.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
It wasn't the same console.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.960
I mean, I don't know.

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:07.480
It's just silly.

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:08.480
It is silly.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:14.720
But once again, it is we're in a capitalist society, so we can go ahead and they can do

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.120
whatever decisions they want.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:19.040
And if we support it with our wallets and they'll continue to do that, if you don't

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:20.280
like it, then don't buy it.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.520
I only paid full price for it once.

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:23.520
Let's be clear.

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.520
All right.

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.120
Anyway, let's move on.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.900
Let's talk about someone that's not going to be getting full price.

01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:32.000
That is going to be the executives at EA.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:39.200
So what happened is that investors actually voted down a proposal for EA to pay their

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:40.200
executives.

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:44.240
It's interesting because EA is not having a bad year, notably.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.480
Video games are performing relatively strongly, and that includes EA.

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:51.980
I mean, it might not be like Nintendo level strong, but EA is performing strongly due

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:54.340
to the coronavirus and everything that's going on.

01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:56.520
More people are staying home and playing video games.

01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:00.360
Apex Legends is doing very well and so on and so on.

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:06.720
However, investors cast one hundred and seventy one million votes against an EA executive

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:07.880
pay package.

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:11.560
Apparently sixty million votes were in favor.

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:12.560
That's kind of interesting.

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:16.760
I guess some of the issue that happened was that EA was rewarding executives with secondary

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:21.000
stock awards before the first ones had been vested.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.680
So that wasn't a whole issue as well.

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:30.960
EA apparently went to per CTW Investment Group said EA went, quote, too far in terms of executive

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:37.760
pay, piling on exorbitant equity awards while paying multimillion dollar bonuses following

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.320
worker layoffs.

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:43.400
And that's talking about what happened with EA Melbourne fire monkeys.

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:47.320
So very interesting.

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:52.840
To put some of this like to put some money numbers on this, the chief technology officer

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:59.460
Kenneth Moss and chief financial officer Blake Jorgensen get six hundred and ninety

01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:05.120
one thousand dollars in change and eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year each.

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:12.240
But they also get these equity grants worth seven point five million and five point five

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:13.240
million.

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:16.240
That's a lot of money.

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:19.200
How are they going to live without all that extra money?

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:22.800
I mean, like, oh, they're going to what are we going to fill the money pit with?

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:24.920
That's potentially homeless at that point.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:25.920
So anyway.

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:26.920
Yeah.

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:33.560
So EA responded to Bloomberg Financial magazine saying the board and compensation committee

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:38.560
will take their feedback into account as part of our ongoing evaluation of our compensation

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:39.560
programs.

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:44.220
So finally, people are stepping up and saying maybe you're making too much fucking money.

01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:50.200
So that's kind of interesting, especially I do like that it's called out that like,

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:54.080
you can't fucking lay off all these people in Melbourne and then take these gigantic

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:55.080
packages.

01:07:55.080 --> 01:08:01.080
That's Activision's job.

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:05.600
And what's interesting is that that's coming from the investors of EA, not within EA.

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:11.440
So SSJ 100 Matt says they will have to settle for a twenty twenty Ferrari instead of a twenty

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:14.520
twenty one.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:18.920
Phoenix seventy seven twenty six says they can't get their third boat.

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:21.520
Four babies.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:24.960
All right.

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:28.160
Phoenix seventy seven twenty six says I'm already eating the rich.

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:29.880
I can't handle any more.

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:30.880
All right.

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:31.880
Let's move on.

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:35.840
Loki, speaking of some executive shuffling, right?

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:36.840
Yes.

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:45.560
So we first have Assassin's Creed creative director who has been let go of the company.

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:53.440
Basraf Ismail, he stepped down from his role in June after being accused of pursuing extramarital

01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:57.500
relationships with women under false pretense because, you know, Ubisoft was having a lot

01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:00.580
of these issues come up recently.

01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:07.400
So of course, he has left the company because of the investigation to his misconduct, which

01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:12.560
apparently they've found out that they're somebody that was warranted, I guess.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:15.200
They said following investigation by an external firm.

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:19.680
It was determined that Ashraf's employment with Ubisoft had to be terminated.

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:20.680
So basically.

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:21.680
Yeah.

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.840
You know, all those things that people were saying that was happening at Ubisoft.

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:24.840
Yeah.

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:26.240
They were happening in Ubisoft.

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:33.680
So I expect that this won't be the last that we'll hear of people leaving that company

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:41.840
and completely other news, though, and not related to sexual misconduct allegations.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:49.040
Laslo Jones, who is one of the developers or the minds behind, is to say the Grand Theft

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:51.160
Auto series since Grand Theft Auto three.

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:55.520
He also plays a fictional version of himself, kind of like almost like a Howard Stern type

01:09:55.520 --> 01:10:02.160
character on the in-game radios within the series as well.

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:08.480
He's actually left the company as of back in April, and he's actually left to go work

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:10.440
on some different projects as well.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:17.520
So he's, I believe, gone to Netflix and are developing shows for both Netflix and Disney,

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:21.400
as well as doing consulting work for video game companies.

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:23.760
So that's more of a positive note.

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:31.840
But yeah, it's nice to hear people actually going leaving because of opportunity growth

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:32.840
opportunities.

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:33.840
Yes.

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:36.240
Instead of being shown the door.

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.680
Yes, exactly.

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:38.680
Yes.

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:41.080
That individual needed to be shown the door.

01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:46.200
So I'm glad to hear Ubisoft is taking the steps they need to take that we all kind of

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.200
saw coming.

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:48.200
So that's good.

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:51.600
But yeah, these are kind of this is a weird pairing to put together.

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:55.440
Sorry, but it's, you know, it's executive changes at companies, I suppose.

01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:58.520
But yeah, it'll be interesting to see what Laslo is going to be working on, especially

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:01.600
with that, you know, kind of resume Grand Theft Auto four or five.

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:04.320
These are huge games that made buku bucks.

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:07.260
Could it be a Grand Theft Auto game for Netflix?

01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:08.260
Probably not.

01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:10.980
Maybe something that that feels like it.

01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:14.380
He's just probably I mean, because it's a really huge game series.

01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:19.140
I mean, so I can imagine that, you know, he has a lot of industry knowledge as well.

01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:24.300
And maybe if they whenever at this point, like I'm not holding my breath or anything,

01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:28.440
they do a Grand Theft Auto six at some point when you when they're tired of rereleasing

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:33.740
Grand Theft Auto five for the millionth time, then maybe they'll have him back as a guest

01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:36.640
DJ again to, you know, reprise his role.

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:39.360
But we'll see.

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:43.720
Or or his cousin, Laszlo will take over.

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:44.720
Who knows?

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:45.720
All right.

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:46.720
Yeah.

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:47.720
Anyway.

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:48.720
All right.

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:49.720
Let's move on.

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:53.000
We're going to go to the classic game of the week.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.920
So every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and

01:11:56.920 --> 01:12:01.100
finds a game that she thinks, hey, you brats out there on the Internet, you should be playing

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:02.100
this game.

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:03.940
Dark Sakura sadly is not here tonight.

01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:06.080
She will be back with us next week.

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.940
So tonight I have picked a game for us.

01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:12.280
But, Loki, I would say, pay attention, because I really tried to pick a game tonight.

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:15.360
And I think you will very much approve of my selection tonight.

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:19.200
And you don't even know what it is yet, because I made a boo boo on the show role.

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:20.800
So I'll give you a hint, Loki.

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:25.440
This is a game we have talked about like a million times on this show.

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:30.160
And somehow it has never been a classic game of the week, like a lot of things can be a

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:31.160
lot of games.

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:34.000
This game inspired other games.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.920
And I think one of them was a classic game of the week not that long ago.

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:40.440
And that was probably the last time this game came up.

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:47.200
This is a game that I used to play in my junior high school PC lab on lunch, where my friends

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.200
and I were trying to kill each other with nukes.

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:56.600
Oh, I have a feeling I know what it is.

01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:57.600
All right.

01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:00.360
Well, if you guessed scorched earth, you're oops, that's the wrong.

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:01.360
Sorry.

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:02.360
Oh, darn it.

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:03.360
Sorry.

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:04.720
That was the wrong footage.

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:05.720
My bad.

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:06.720
That does not look like scorched earth.

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:07.720
That was not scorched earth.

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:08.720
That is something else.

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:09.720
Yep.

01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:10.720
Yep.

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:11.720
Yep.

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:12.720
We'll talk about that.

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:13.840
I just spoiled something big.

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:14.840
That's coming up later.

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:16.120
We'll talk about that later.

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:18.360
I fucking love live, don't you?

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.360
Let's try this instead.

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:20.360
There we go.

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:21.360
There's scorched earth.

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:23.160
I hit the wrong goddamn thing.

01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:24.160
All right.

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.160
All right.

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:26.160
There you go.

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:27.600
Scorched earth is the classic game of the week.

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:35.160
So scorched earth is a game that came out for good old MS-DOS in 1991.

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:40.420
So the developer of this game was a guy named Wendell Hicken, and that's it.

01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:46.220
It was him because, you know, back in the old days of gaming, games were created by

01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:48.100
one person.

01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:49.420
And this is an example of that.

01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:54.820
So this game was released shareware, meaning that you basically got the entire fucking

01:13:54.820 --> 01:14:00.420
game for free, but it just asked you to kindly pay him money, which I bet very few people

01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:01.420
did.

01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:02.420
But actually, Logie, didn't you pay for this?

01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:04.940
I thought this was one of the ones you said you did.

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.500
I think I don't remember.

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:07.500
It was so long ago.

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:10.060
I most likely did.

01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:13.780
I thought that it wasn't the shareware version, then they have some weapons locked or something

01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:14.780
like that.

01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:15.780
That might have been the case.

01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:20.140
I think some weapons, I think some of the field generation and things like that looked

01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:21.660
a little different and so forth.

01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:26.860
So there is all of that too.

01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:31.260
So anyhow, Scorched Earth is a turn-based artillery game.

01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:34.260
So again, it's very similar to like Worms.

01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:38.940
Worms came after this, and Worms was very inspired by a game like this.

01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:41.420
Tank Wars would be another example of an early game.

01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:45.580
I almost went with that, but Tank Wars and Scorched Earth are really cut from the same

01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:49.420
cloth and they're almost interchangeable, almost.

01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:52.860
It's all about the angle and the power.

01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:57.120
And you use that to shoot your weapon and see what happens.

01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:00.900
And you can notice if you're watching on Twitch, you can see that these tanks, I think there's

01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:05.300
one human player and there's like nine fake computer players.

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:08.100
And you'll notice they're all trying to kill each other by lobbing these weapons at each

01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:09.100
other.

01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:11.420
But the human player can actually change their weapons.

01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:16.020
So I think they're firing now like a slightly bigger missile than the baby missiles the

01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:17.860
others are firing off.

01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:20.460
So obviously the goal is to kill the other tanks.

01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:26.060
But as you fire your weapon, you're also changing the environment, which is a good lesson about

01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:30.460
war is that the more you fire off nukes, the more mountains you're going to destroy.

01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:33.940
So there is certainly that as well.

01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:38.280
Scorched Earth referred to itself as the mother of all games.

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:39.780
Do you know where this comes from?

01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:42.740
It's because this game was released in 1991.

01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:45.140
That's when the Gulf War was going on.

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:49.620
That was after Saddam Hussein said to the U.S. if they walked on Iraqi soil, it would

01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:52.540
be the mother of all battles.

01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:55.540
So that's where the name the mother of all games came from.

01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:58.340
I never knew that until I logged onto Wikipedia.

01:15:58.340 --> 01:15:59.900
How about that?

01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:02.740
Anyway, there's also environmental issues.

01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:06.420
For example, the stage they're playing on now, I believe meteors will randomly fall

01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:07.540
or it's the lightning bolts.

01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:11.560
One of the two will randomly fall and could affect tanks destroying.

01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:14.460
Tanks blowing up could do different things.

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:18.940
Some of them do like elaborate firework shows that will kill everything.

01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:22.100
Some of them just do a little like poop and it's gone.

01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:26.100
Or I think the beam up happens like when I was looking at this before the show.

01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:28.580
Like there's two or three different ones that just beam up.

01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:32.020
So they kind of like dig into the soil and then they just beam up out of the stress.

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:34.300
It doesn't really hurt other people.

01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:39.740
But yeah, and sometimes seeing the elaborate ways that tanks would die is what made this

01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:40.740
game worth playing.

01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:41.740
Right, Loki?

01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:46.460
Yeah, I like also being able to earn money between rounds and you get to purchase weapons

01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:47.460
with that.

01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:48.460
Yes.

01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:54.460
And apparently you can edit the configuration files, TOC 1 CFG and TOC 2 CFG.

01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:58.340
You can edit those configuration files so that the tanks say whatever you want them

01:16:58.340 --> 01:16:59.340
to say.

01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:01.980
Yes, you can.

01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:04.020
Loki is very aware with this.

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:09.140
Anyways, there's all sorts of weapons and there's shields and things get crazy.

01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:13.940
And again, if you've seen Worms, Worms was very inspired by a game like this, so you

01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:15.740
kind of know where it's going.

01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:19.300
But we need to pay respect to the games that came before it, which Squirt's Earth is a

01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:20.860
great example of.

01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:24.820
You can play this with up to 10 players, so that could either be live people or computer

01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:25.860
controlled people.

01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:29.480
So like I said, sometimes we would eat lunch in the science classroom where there were

01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:33.020
some PCs and there would be like five of us and the teacher didn't care.

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:36.920
He thought it was great that we he looked at it as we were learning and we weren't getting

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:37.920
into trouble.

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:41.320
He loved it that we would come in his class and play these games, you know, because it's

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:42.700
not like they're that violent.

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:45.920
I mean, sure, the tanks explode, but it's not like you see burning bodies and things

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:46.920
like that.

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:48.940
It's pretty tame, all things considered.

01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:54.320
The last version of the game, 1.5, was released in 1995.

01:17:54.320 --> 01:18:00.420
You can actually download this game right now on the official site Wiccan.com.

01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:03.840
That's W-H-I-C-K-E-N dot com.

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:07.500
And if you're willing to kick back a donation, he kind of has to pay what you want for like

01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:11.780
an all encompassing package that allows you to modify the game to your heart's content

01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:13.100
and all of that as well.

01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:14.920
So I think that's pretty cool.

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:17.540
So yeah, there it is.

01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:21.380
Your classic game of the week is scorched earth.

01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:27.080
Other games inspired by this, not just worms, but things like atomic tanks, nasty armored

01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:33.820
tanks of war, X scorch, scorch tanks, scorch 3D, whole lot of games that were inspired

01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:35.760
by scorched earth and again, worms.

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:38.420
I think that's the one that everybody kind of knows is worms.

01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:44.120
So I'm telling you, Tommy Tallarico, they need to get this on the Amico.

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:48.360
I mean, that's a, that's a game seller or console seller right there.

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:50.980
Do you think, I mean, this seems like the type of thing that could be pretty easily

01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:52.820
adaptable for the Amico.

01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:58.440
I mean, if you, if you say in television Amico three times into the mirror, Tommy Tallarico

01:18:58.440 --> 01:18:59.900
will show up and send you a tweet.

01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:02.120
So please elaborate.

01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:03.120
Yeah.

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:07.120
All right.

01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:10.140
That's going to do it for your classic game of the week.

01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:11.140
So let's go back.

01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:14.920
And of course my chat room just froze up anyway.

01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:15.920
That's all right.

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:16.920
We'll get back into some other news.

01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:19.560
So why don't we get into some rapid fire news, Loki?

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:20.560
Yeah.

01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:25.640
So there's a whole bunch of interesting mods that are on some of these games that were

01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:31.040
on the switch or in this case, the Wii U so breath of the wild, of course, lots of mods

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:37.520
for that because the emulation on PC is so good right now.

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:41.360
And one of the mods that's actually been made is incredibly elaborate.

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:51.120
So there's a mod developer Wai Kuteru who put out a mod that adds an entire race track

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:55.380
from Mario Kart 8.

01:19:55.380 --> 01:20:01.980
So Luigi's, it looks like Luigi's race track and you can actually race if they made a mini

01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:02.980
game out of it.

01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:08.740
So you race the entire track on the master cycle while these obstacles kind of prevent

01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:10.880
you from finishing the race.

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:16.020
So there's like a giant boulders, flame spouts, all sorts of things.

01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:20.820
And you're supposed to race around the track to get a good time.

01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:25.780
This is insane, the amount of effort that would have taken to put Luigi circuit in there.

01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:33.660
But yeah, that's apparently a thing that people can do on these emulation devices to be able

01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:36.020
to mod games in such crazy ways like this.

01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:39.660
So I'm not sure where you can check this out.

01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:46.660
I just know that they showed it on his YouTube channel, but apparently you can, I'm sure

01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:50.620
you can get, oh, he has it through his Patreon so you can acquire it through there.

01:20:50.620 --> 01:20:53.460
I'm assuming if you're a backer.

01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:57.060
And then this is a game I would love to see come back.

01:20:57.060 --> 01:21:03.180
So apparently Scott Pilgrim vs. the World of course was delisted a long time ago back in

01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:11.420
2014, but apparently there's talks now that the creator Brian Lee O'Malley has been in

01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:17.620
contact with Ubisoft and apparently they're going to try to work out some deal with Universal

01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:21.460
Pictures to maybe bring the game back to modern consoles.

01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:22.460
Yeah, he put out a tweet.

01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:24.020
He put out a tweet about that.

01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:28.180
Like it, like it was for, for a while it was like Ubisoft isn't calling, Ubisoft isn't

01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:29.180
calling.

01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:31.180
And then he put out a tweet this week that was like, they called.

01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:36.500
Yeah, it was PS Ubisoft has reached out to me.

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:38.900
I mean, I would love for that to come back.

01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:41.980
It was such a great game.

01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:44.260
Such great artwork in there as well.

01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:47.260
I would, I would love to see that.

01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:50.340
Yeah, I'd be really excited to see that too.

01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:53.460
And you know, the movie is having all this anniversary stuff going on because it's been,

01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:57.020
I can't believe it's been 10 years since that movie came out, but it has, I know, right.

01:21:57.020 --> 01:21:59.460
We all just felt our age right there.

01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:03.380
But you know, there's like new soundtrack coming out because like the actual film version

01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:06.580
of that song that Brie Larson sings is finally going to be out.

01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:09.940
And I know a lot of people are very excited about that.

01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:13.340
And then they had like a big zoom thing or something.

01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:14.340
I don't know.

01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:17.220
But like a lot of the cast did like stuff recently.

01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:20.580
And you know, if we were able to do movies and events like that right now, we'd probably

01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:22.660
be seeing a lot of cult screenings of it.

01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:26.980
I actually hosted a screening of Scott Pilgrim.

01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:28.580
It was about two years ago.

01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:31.140
We did a, it was a double feature here.

01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:33.900
They did Kung Fury and they did Scott Pilgrim.

01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:36.260
It was like a gamer movie night.

01:22:36.260 --> 01:22:40.940
And they actually had one of the actors from Kung Fury there, which was pretty cool.

01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:44.340
Sadly, they were trying, I can't say who, but they were trying to get one of the people

01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:49.140
from Scott Pilgrim, but it didn't end up working out with their schedule or what have you.

01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:53.040
So I would have loved that, but they still showed the movie and it got a great response

01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:54.040
from the crowd.

01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:58.660
Like it's one of those movies that maybe, cause I don't think it did great at the box

01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:00.440
office when it first came out.

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:03.980
But like, it's one of those movies that like, I think people of a certain age or just people

01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:09.880
that love games, they really enjoy it so much that like when you get a theater full of people

01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:13.880
that like Scott Pilgrim and like video games, it's a very different experience from when

01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:15.940
I saw it in the theater the first time.

01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:17.840
So I, that was fun.

01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:22.400
And I wish, you know, if COVID wasn't a thing, you'd probably see a lot of anniversary screenings

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:25.520
going on right now, but yeah, bummer.

01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:27.320
So all right.

01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:31.720
Phoenix 7726 in chat says the comics got color versions too.

01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:32.720
Really slick.

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:37.400
SSJ100 Matt says they were going to re-release the movie for Dolby Atmos theaters for the

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:38.800
10 year anniversary.

01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:43.400
But COVID, oh, that sucks because obviously with the chiptune sound effects and everything

01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:46.160
really cool that that movie brought, that's a bummer.

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:47.160
All right.

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:53.000
Moving on some other rapid fire stories here, Commander Keen, Keen Dreams is coming to Nintendo

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.400
Switch on August 27th, 2020.

01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:59.920
Of course, this is an old throwback.

01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:01.720
This is not a new Commander Keen game.

01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:07.680
This is like a throwback title to like episode, I think this is the four or five and six episode.

01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:11.920
I might be wrong because I think there is a Commander Keen series already on Switch.

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:14.720
And this one is like the next one coming out.

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:20.540
It is coming out, yeah, you can get the original Commander Keen and Keen Dreams for six bucks.

01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:28.400
And then the Definitive Edition is 15 bucks for full widescreen support, 12 all new levels,

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:31.400
and it doubles the length of the original game and a full music score.

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:33.280
Well, that's pretty cool.

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:34.840
That must means Commander Keen did well enough.

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:39.640
You know, I almost made that the classic game of the week this week, but then it made me

01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:43.400
think of MS-DOS games from the 90s and I thought of Scorched Earth and I was like,

01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:44.880
oh, we need to do that one.

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:46.920
So all right.

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:53.240
Also in the rumor department, although it's a pretty substantial rumor because it's it's

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:57.460
from a picture, so it's probably happening.

01:24:57.460 --> 01:24:59.440
It's unfortunately not.

01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:00.440
Oh, really?

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:01.440
It was fate?

01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:02.440
Yeah, it was.

01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:03.440
Oh, bummer.

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:04.440
All right.

01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:05.440
Well, apparently it was.

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:06.440
I just read about it.

01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:07.440
Yeah.

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:08.440
All right.

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:09.440
It was supposed to be a Virtua Fighter cabinet.

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:11.680
Well, whoever photoshopped it did a really good job.

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:12.680
Kudos to them.

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:13.680
Who shot it down?

01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:16.040
Did Sega say something or Arcade 1up said something about it?

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:17.040
Arcade 1up did.

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:18.040
Yeah.

01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:19.040
Ah, bummer.

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:20.040
All right.

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:21.040
Well, then I won't say any more because it's already been debunked.

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:22.040
All right.

01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:26.280
Instead, why don't I mention, um, damn, there was late breaking news before the show.

01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:27.840
And of course, in the moment, I can't remember.

01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:32.280
Oh, I was going to say they posted a picture though of their, um, it was, I forget it was

01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:33.760
one of the people that are working on Arcade 1up.

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:38.520
They did post a actual like photo of what the pinball cabinets looked like.

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:39.600
Oh, right.

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:40.600
They look pretty awesome.

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:41.600
Oh, that's awesome.

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:42.720
Uh, I remember what it was.

01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:46.560
I saw floating around Twitter because it was trending on Twitter, apparently a, uh, listing

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:52.680
for Zelda Skyward Sword, which was the Nintendo Wii title, not the, like the first one was

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:53.680
Twilight Princess.

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:57.680
Then Skyward Sword was kind of towards the end of the Wii's life cycle, a listing for

01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:00.400
that has been spotted for the Switch.

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:06.240
So did Nintendo throw together a remaster to carry us through this holiday season, perhaps

01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:08.160
while some other games are waiting?

01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:11.120
It remains to be seen, but that is a very interesting development.

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:16.040
Uh, if Skyward Sword is going to get a second chance, um, on, well, I don't think it necessarily

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:19.160
did bad on the Wii cause the Wii was a huge selling console, but it came out towards the

01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:24.320
end of the Wii's life when the Wii U started kind of for better for worse showed up.

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:28.480
So I think there may be a lot of people that didn't really get to experience Skyward Sword,

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:32.760
even though I think that game is only about 10 years old, um, who may, uh, get to experience

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:34.440
all over again on Switch.

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:36.600
So we'll see what happens with that.

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:37.600
Hmm.

01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:42.000
Um, now, uh, some folks in chat are talking about movie theaters reopening since I was

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.320
talking about Scott Pilgrim, uh, and so forth.

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:47.240
Uh, Phoenix 77 says, uh, theaters reopening.

01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:48.240
Anyone want to take bets?

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:53.920
I'm thinking late 2021 to which Bobby like later this month to which Bobby Blackwell

01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:59.000
said AMC theaters are opening on August 20th movie tickets are 15 cents.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:04.240
But the question is, yeah, who's willing to go, uh, we'll say, I mean, I guess it depends

01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:05.240
on where you are.

01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:08.200
Here's, here's a, what was it?

01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:11.840
I was watching, um, Phil DeFranco on YouTube.

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:15.160
And one of the things that he mentioned was, so for 15 cents a ticket, you can just buy

01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:19.800
out the whole theater and go buy yourself because there's only 30% capacity.

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:21.440
I mean, like how much would that really cost?

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:22.440
That's true.

01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:23.440
That's a good point.

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:24.440
Pretty cheap.

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:25.440
So just buy all the seats.

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:29.960
Well, a lot of times the fine print for those deals say limit two per customer or something

01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:30.960
like that.

01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:33.160
So there's usually how they're going to get around it.

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:34.160
Yep.

01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:35.160
Yeah.

01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:37.000
Drive in chat says drive in movies made a comeback around here.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Yeah.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Same.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000
And now it's driving events too.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.280
I'm hearing about like drive in drag queen shows and things like that.

01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:43.680
It's very interesting.

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:50.400
Just I just crossed my fingers and my toes, the vaccine is out for the holidays and it

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:51.400
works.

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:57.400
Um, cause I know there was the, the talk about the Russian vaccine, but they haven't really

01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:58.400
tested it.

01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:04.120
It sounds like so, but anyway, hopefully they will have a tested vetted, good, solid vaccine.

01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:09.520
That science says, yes, this will help stop the spread of COVID if people get this, then

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:11.160
I will go to the damn movies.

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:12.160
Yes.

01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:15.440
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, until then wear a fucking mask.

01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:16.440
Yes.

01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:17.440
Yes.

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:18.440
All right.

01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:19.440
Let's move on.

01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:20.480
Uh, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:23.160
Some more things you can play at home while you wait for the movie theaters to open back

01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:24.160
up.

01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:25.160
Yes.

01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:26.800
So this week we got quite a few good things.

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:30.260
So Microsoft flight simulator coming out on PC.

01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:38.260
We have mortal shell on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one battle toads on PC and Xbox one

01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:45.900
cupid parasites on Nintendo switch, uh, danganronpa to goodbye despair anniversary edition on

01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:54.140
iOS and Android, uh, Oh, Kana for rhythm across the blue on Nintendo switch and PlayStation

01:28:54.140 --> 01:29:02.460
four new super Lucky's tale on PlayStation four and Xbox one, uh, PGA tour, two K 21

01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:09.260
on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four, Xbox one and stadia, uh, samurai Jack battle

01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:15.100
through time on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:18.100
And I believe that's it.

01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:19.100
All right.

01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:21.940
Then let's take a look at Japan and we'll look at the releases there.

01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:24.820
And uh, since Jamie's not here tonight, I'll ask you to do Europe as well.

01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:27.940
Uh, going over Japan and looking at the releases there.

01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:33.220
Cupid parasite comes out on the Nintendo switch and a regular and limited edition on the 20th

01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:34.220
of this month.

01:29:34.220 --> 01:29:35.980
I'm trying to figure out what cupid parasite is.

01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:40.940
Uh, it looks like it's another, uh, manga or anime, um, related title, a story about

01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:45.600
a cupid who ran away from her family after a fight to become the most successful bridal

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:48.580
advisor in the human world.

01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:53.940
One day the heroin's boss calls her up for a job to find five hopeless guys or parasites

01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:59.700
in desperate need of fixing their love life and probably their personalities in some cases.

01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:01.340
Huh?

01:30:01.340 --> 01:30:04.100
That sounds like a disaster, but all right.

01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:10.380
Uh, anyway, on the PlayStation four this week in Japan, zombie survival colony builder,

01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:11.380
there are billions.

01:30:11.380 --> 01:30:13.720
That is the name of the game.

01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:17.700
Also rock of ages gets a localized release in Japan.

01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:22.660
Greed fall also gets a release in Japan this week on the PlayStation four.

01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:25.940
So let's go to the UK and the UK.

01:30:25.940 --> 01:30:31.860
We also have Microsoft flight simulator on PC, uh, pathfinder Kingmaker deluxe edition

01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:39.940
on places for an Xbox one, uh, Willie jet man, Astro monkeys, revenge, sweeper edition.

01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:47.500
That's on PlayStation four and quite the name, uh, mr driller drill land on Nintendo switch

01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:54.580
PGA tour, two K 21 on PlayStation four and Xbox one house flipper on PlayStation four

01:30:54.580 --> 01:31:01.700
Xbox one and Nintendo switch, um, made of sker on Xbox one.

01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:05.160
Now that's going to be hilarious if that's a survivor horror game, cause it kind of looks

01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:14.620
like that based on a screenshot made of sker, uh, pinstripe on Nintendo switch, a Kana four

01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:18.140
rhythms across the blue on Nintendo switch.

01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:19.140
And that's it.

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:22.340
All right, let's get to the mailbag every week.

01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:27.780
You guys send us emails, participate at orange lounge, radio.com and we read all the emails

01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:29.780
that aren't spam on the air.

01:31:29.780 --> 01:31:33.980
So our first email this night comes to us from red entertainment who starts off saying

01:31:33.980 --> 01:31:38.580
hello peoples and sends us a link to a story we talked about earlier in the show.

01:31:38.580 --> 01:31:42.340
There's something about Apple's move to pull fortnight from the app store that doesn't

01:31:42.340 --> 01:31:43.340
make sense to me.

01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:46.700
And when I dig around a bit, it still doesn't make sense to me.

01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:50.260
Apple released a statement about you, about their move that I'm not going to repeat here

01:31:50.260 --> 01:31:55.620
because it's a peak example of utilizing incomprehensible legalese in order to befuddle the masses.

01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:59.900
If you stare at Apple statement long enough and reread it enough times, you get the vague

01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:03.660
impression that Epic violates Apple's rules as it related to payment.

01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:05.900
Okay, what are those rules?

01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:09.820
And I'm going to assume before this email or this email may have come in before Google

01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:13.820
was involved in this too, because there was about a 12 hour period where Apple pulled

01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:16.220
them and then Google pulled them, right?

01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:17.220
I'm not sure.

01:32:17.220 --> 01:32:20.220
Yeah, it was pretty, pretty short but it was a few hours.

01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:23.900
This email seems to be focusing on the Apple side of things, but I do want to clarify that.

01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:30.380
Anyway, red entertainment continues and actually links to the Apple guidelines and continues.

01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:34.220
If you read Apple's rules as it's related to payment in section 311, you come across

01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:35.220
this line.

01:32:35.220 --> 01:32:40.980
Apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that

01:32:40.980 --> 01:32:44.660
direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.

01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:47.740
There, that's the rule Epic appears to have violated.

01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:51.980
When Epic told users how to purchase in-game currency outside of the Fortnite iOS app and

01:32:51.980 --> 01:32:54.900
enabled users to do exactly that, they violated Apple's rules.

01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:56.180
Okay, that's simple.

01:32:56.180 --> 01:32:57.600
Why didn't Apple just say that?

01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:01.360
Why did Apple put out a statement that's filled with incomprehensible legal jargon?

01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:04.800
Why couldn't Apple explain their actions in a way that is easily understandable by

01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:05.800
humans?

01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:07.320
Now, I know what you're thinking.

01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:12.000
I don't have to pay for, insert app here, through Apple in order to use, insert Apple

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.680
here, on my Apple device.

01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:14.680
That's right, you don't.

01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:17.320
A notable example of this is Spotify.

01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:19.620
Spotify has subscription plans for its users.

01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:23.720
You cannot sign up for any of those subscription plans inside the Spotify iOS app.

01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:27.600
Is there a button inside the Spotify that takes you to where you can sign up for a subscription?

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:28.600
No.

01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:29.600
Is there a link that can do the same?

01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:30.600
No.

01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:34.480
Does the Spotify tell you what you have to go outside the app to sign up for a subscription?

01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:35.480
No.

01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:38.160
What does the Spotify app say about how to sign up for a subscription?

01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:40.280
You can't upgrade to premium in the app.

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:41.280
We know.

01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:42.280
It's not ideal.

01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:43.280
And that's it.

01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:47.920
That's why the Spotify iOS app is currently available in the app store and Fortnite isn't.

01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:51.040
Spotify doesn't tell you that you have to go outside the app to give it money.

01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:52.200
Fortnite did.

01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:59.000
Stay care, stay care, entertainment sent from my iPhone.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.560
I thought I'd throw that in there.

01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:04.880
Anyway, no, I mean, and honestly, yes, you're right.

01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:09.560
And that is exactly like, and I think I kind of mentioned this before, when we have the

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:13.000
example of Twitch, Twitch will sell the bits in the app.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:16.600
They will also sell those same bits on their website, but they don't advertise it in the

01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:17.600
app.

01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:19.520
That's what Epic's trying to do.

01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:21.520
And Epic broke the rules.

01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:27.120
Now you do make a good point about, or a good, you raise a good question, we'll say, about

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:33.920
why doesn't Apple just respond in plain language instead of all this legalese?

01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:39.920
I don't disagree, but my thought is, well, Epic's now made it a legal issue.

01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:44.700
So it's being responded to in legalese because anything Apple says at this point can and

01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:46.960
will be used against them in a court.

01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:53.760
So I think, that's my thought, why they're responding with legalese.

01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:56.320
But otherwise, I think you're right.

01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:02.360
If Epic wasn't trying to do this whole click here for a 20% off sale, it probably wouldn't

01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:03.800
be an issue.

01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:06.680
But they did it on purpose because they wanted to make it an issue.

01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:08.120
They knew what they were doing.

01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:12.800
Because they want to put their own store on Apple's front.

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:18.720
And that's gonna probably be exhibit A, is that, well, they knew what they were doing

01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:25.960
because look at this prepared video that they made because they wanted to be fancy like

01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:28.960
I don't know.

01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:35.480
Epic is not a saint in this whole thing and that is very, very important to note.

01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:39.960
Anyway, but otherwise, honestly, your email is a lot of the same stuff I've been thinking

01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:44.080
and I like that you actually, you brought the receipt when it came to what the rule

01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:45.080
is that they violated.

01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:46.480
All right, moving on.

01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:50.640
We have one more email tonight and this one is from Elliot B. who says in this email,

01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:55.560
hey, OLR, I made another game and I want to share it with you all.

01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:02.560
It's a music game heavily inspired by Guitaro Man called Chiptari Woman.

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:07.040
Since it doesn't seem like there will be an official sequel anytime soon, I decided to

01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:08.640
make my own.

01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:16.240
It was for low res jam where the maximum resolution for submissions is 64 by 64.

01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:21.000
At least they gave participants a leisurely two and a half weeks to finish it.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:27.600
Here's the link, pawprints.itch.io slash Chiptari Woman.

01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:32.160
I'm actually going to copy paste that into the chat since that's a lot and for the folks

01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:38.680
that are listening on the podcast, I imagine if you go to that itch.io store, pawprints.itch.io,

01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:40.640
you'll find it there pretty easy.

01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:46.040
I've attached a video of the first minute of gameplay too and finally for a change,

01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:52.000
I was able to grab the video in time and get it loaded here so you can actually see it.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:37:00.440
So this is Chiptari Woman created by one of our listeners, Elliot B. for the low res jam

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:03.920
and I've got to say, this looks awesome.

01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:05.600
You've done a very good job.

01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:07.080
I would play this.

01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:09.320
I would likely pay money for this.

01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:14.040
I also want to know, did you do the music because that's really good if you did or did

01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:24.080
you get a friend or did you get a free domain type stuff or I'm curious where the music

01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:28.840
came from because it's really good and one of the important things that makes a music

01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:33.000
game is, is the music good?

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.480
And some comments that are coming in from chat, Elliot, because I don't know if you're

01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:37.560
here live.

01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:38.680
This looks cool.

01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:40.640
Wow, this looks great.

01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:42.040
This is so cool.

01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:45.400
I want to fly through a wall and start jamming too because that's what happened with the

01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:47.840
little guy in the minute long teaser here.

01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:50.920
So yeah, and that's a 64 by 64 resolution.

01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:54.360
So kudos to you, Elliot B. like this looks awesome.

01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:59.120
So I will check this out and all those questions I just asked are probably answered on that

01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:01.520
store page and I probably just need to go take a look at it.

01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:02.520
In fact, I'm going to do that now.

01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:04.000
Can you see the video, Loki?

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.200
Yeah, it looks pretty cool.

01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:09.280
Yeah, and this looks cool.

01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:14.160
So the music is done by, it's by Merkle, M R K L is the artist's name.

01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:15.160
Thank you.

01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:16.160
Okay.

01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:17.200
But yeah, that's awesome.

01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:19.720
So it is original music though by Merkle.

01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:27.040
So yeah, it says adorable pixel art and other worldly opponent and it works with game pads

01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:28.600
if your browser supports it.

01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:29.920
Oh, look who just popped up in chat.

01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:30.920
Elliot B's in chat.

01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:32.440
Kudos to you, my friend.

01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:34.360
This looks really good.

01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:37.360
You should like sell this.

01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:38.360
I don't know.

01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:39.360
I mean, I don't know.

01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:43.240
I, you know, maybe you'll want to have it at a resolution that still looks retro, but

01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:44.840
like plays on phones or something.

01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:46.840
I don't know.

01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:48.920
But you're onto something here.

01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:50.440
That's for sure.

01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:56.160
So Phoenix 7726 says Merkle like Angela Merkle.

01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:05.240
No it's M R K L and it's in, they have their own itch.io storefront and mrkl.itch.io.

01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:08.880
So there you go.

01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:11.080
Kudos to you, Elliot.

01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:13.760
You know, we're in the wrong business, Loki.

01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:19.560
We need to start like a indie promotion business because we've got some great game makers we've

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:24.720
come across over the years here at OLR, including YYR, right?

01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:27.020
And all the wonderful games he's done.

01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:33.640
And now we have Elliot B. So I want, what other indie developers are lurking out there?

01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:34.640
Fix your games.

01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:35.880
Send us emails.

01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:36.880
Why not?

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:38.040
We love indie titles.

01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:39.600
So that's great.

01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:40.920
And Elliot B says, thanks guys.

01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:42.520
The nice comments mean a lot to me.

01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:44.600
Well, it's, it's, it's well fucking done.

01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:45.600
Good for you.

01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:47.960
Uh, I, I, I'm going to play this after the show.

01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:48.960
I really am.

01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:49.960
So cool.

01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:51.120
All right.

01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:56.560
Chiptari Woman, SSJ 100 Matt says I'm dropping the game link in the discord for the podcast

01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:57.560
listeners.

01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:58.760
Ah, very good.

01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:00.040
A call for play.

01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:03.680
Elliot B says, how much will the next plug cost?

01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:06.680
Honestly, all the plugs here are free.

01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:13.600
Like we don't really make money off OLR, so I'm not gonna, um, you know, I mean, we're

01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:18.880
not going to plug the same game every single week, but you know, I want to support, Hey,

01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:19.880
you guys support us.

01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:20.880
We'll support you.

01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:23.160
Especially when the games look that good.

01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:25.720
All right.

01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:26.720
Let's move on.

01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:28.840
Uh, that's it for emails tonight.

01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:31.320
Let's move on to some more stories.

01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:33.080
Loki, you are up.

01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:34.080
Yes.

01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:41.720
Um, so this is once again, a, an example of what not to do if you're making a fan game.

01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:49.160
So there has been this project, uh, this golden eye double seven remake project that's been

01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:54.160
several years into development, golden nine 25.

01:40:54.160 --> 01:41:01.160
And apparently over the last few years, they've posted several, uh, screenshots videos to

01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:03.600
social media.

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:04.880
And what do you think happened?

01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:06.120
Oh, that's right.

01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:07.120
Yes.

01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:11.480
They got a cease and desist from MGM because they didn't have permission to make a fan

01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:14.880
game for, uh, golden eye double seven.

01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:17.080
So yep.

01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:21.520
So unfortunately they can't do a bond game, but they can still do a great game with all

01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:24.600
of the, um, nineties action shooter aspects.

01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:29.640
So basically what they're going to do is take what they did with golden eye and change it

01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:31.680
enough to be not golden.

01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:36.960
Change all the characters, make tweaks to the artwork and release it as an original

01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:37.960
title.

01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:38.960
Ka-blam.

01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:39.960
Yep.

01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:40.960
Done.

01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:41.960
There you go.

01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:42.960
Yep.

01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:43.960
Yeah.

01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:44.960
All right.

01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:48.640
So, and also lesson learned, don't post about your, um, potentially illegal and, uh, IP

01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:53.600
infringing title on social media, because sometimes, uh, there's some social media folks,

01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:57.480
like they scan social media for certain things all the time and double Oh seven might be

01:41:57.480 --> 01:42:01.520
one of them that they're looking for, especially because there was a new movie we were supposed

01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:06.160
to have back in April, but you know, it didn't happen.

01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:10.280
Um, and I don't, they didn't release that double Oh seven movie and I can't even remember

01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:15.540
the name in the moment, but they didn't release that to, uh, the home services there.

01:42:15.540 --> 01:42:18.420
Still hoping they can do a theatrical release maybe next year.

01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:19.420
Huh?

01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:20.420
At least not yet.

01:42:20.420 --> 01:42:21.420
Yeah.

01:42:21.420 --> 01:42:22.420
Let me change your mind.

01:42:22.420 --> 01:42:23.420
Who knows?

01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:30.100
Well, if I feel like Disney was almost bullied into it with Mulan, like, and what they did,

01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:36.700
which I, I still don't love the whole subscribe to Disney plus and pay a premium for Mulan.

01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:40.180
But I also understand it's probably cheaper than going to the movies and some people will

01:42:40.180 --> 01:42:41.980
still pay it, especially those with kids.

01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:43.320
I don't have kids.

01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:48.460
So my perspective on this is maybe different, um, but, and it'll probably be free on Disney

01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:49.460
plus eventually.

01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:52.340
It's just, if I want to see it now, I'm gonna have to pay more money.

01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:58.940
So anyway, all right, well, let's move on and let's talk about, so this one has to do

01:42:58.940 --> 01:43:03.300
with hackers and you know, we say around here, hackers going to hack, they're going to find

01:43:03.300 --> 01:43:04.300
things.

01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:10.340
Uh, and in this case, hackers have found an official of sorts PlayStation one emulator

01:43:10.340 --> 01:43:13.260
for the PlayStation four.

01:43:13.260 --> 01:43:18.180
So in other words, they're trying to pretty much say Sony could offer a PlayStation one

01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:24.740
emulator if they wanted to, because it was embedded in the medieval remaster that came

01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:31.240
out in 2019 the remaster of medieval had the original game in it.

01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:35.940
And so hackers went in, got that emulator and basically, you know, made it so that you

01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:40.760
can run it on a modified PlayStation four and you can play original PlayStation games

01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:43.020
at up to a 4k resolution.

01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:44.840
But of course there's a catch.

01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:46.780
It doesn't play everything cleanly.

01:43:46.780 --> 01:43:52.020
Uh, for example, there's some video out there of Konami's original silent Hill game running

01:43:52.020 --> 01:43:53.020
on it.

01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:57.660
And some of the, like the sprites have really light boxes around them and some things don't

01:43:57.660 --> 01:43:58.660
work right.

01:43:58.660 --> 01:44:01.620
Um, yeah, it's the fog of the end of the Emmy.

01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:06.180
A lot of the emulators have trouble with Fox, even the official ones from Konami, that's

01:44:06.180 --> 01:44:07.180
very true.

01:44:07.180 --> 01:44:08.180
They're parked correctly.

01:44:08.180 --> 01:44:09.500
That is very true.

01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:15.800
So, uh, yeah, so anyway, uh, it's also possible that this is used to run, uh, actual classic

01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:17.780
games available on PlayStation store.

01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:22.560
I don't remember what PS one games are on the PlayStation store is VIP ribbon PlayStation

01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:24.880
four or is that, was that on the three?

01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:25.880
I can't even remember.

01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:29.860
So long ago now that they finally re-released VIP ribbon in English, but I think that was

01:44:29.860 --> 01:44:30.860
on the three.

01:44:30.860 --> 01:44:31.860
Yeah.

01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:34.580
Uh, Oh, and the Vita, that's why it felt a little newer.

01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:40.220
Uh, and then of course we all know the PlayStation classic came out in 2018.

01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:41.380
That was a thing that happened.

01:44:41.380 --> 01:44:45.120
And of course hackers were on that like that and got all the PlayStation ones and they

01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:46.820
worked a little better on that one.

01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:50.620
So, but it's interesting to see that the PlayStation four, you know, obviously they would have

01:44:50.620 --> 01:44:56.420
to make some tweaks to get the other games to run right, but they could, I don't think

01:44:56.420 --> 01:45:00.780
many of us are surprised to hear that, especially when PlayStation two games were running very

01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:04.440
well on the PlayStation four, uh, especially, you know, like when they were selling things

01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:09.140
like Prapa the Rapa two and things like that, they, they play fine on the PlayStation four,

01:45:09.140 --> 01:45:12.980
although I'm sure each and every one of those titles, probably they had to test it and make

01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:16.300
sure it didn't have fog and those types of issues.

01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:21.380
So, um, but it's, it's still interesting to see how hackers went in and grabbed that emulator.

01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:26.180
And now, you know, it's like an official emulator of sorts, uh, even though it doesn't emulate

01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:27.180
everything yet.

01:45:27.180 --> 01:45:28.180
Perfectly.

01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:29.180
All right.

01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:30.180
Let's move on.

01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:31.180
Loki.

01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:32.180
All right.

01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:36.040
Let's talk a little bit about, um, bugs.

01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:41.420
So Red Dead Online, they, you may remember that there was protests and stuff to try to

01:45:41.420 --> 01:45:47.060
get updates to grant or wants to grant the Red Dead Online.

01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:54.940
However, uh, when they implemented the new updates into the game, it broke a lot of stuff.

01:45:54.940 --> 01:46:01.960
So you had all sorts of crazy stuff like flying horses, raining alligators, um, stuff that

01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:06.260
you're not normally supposed to see in Red Dead Redemption.

01:46:06.260 --> 01:46:12.980
Um, I think that's hilarious, but probably doesn't make for a great online experience.

01:46:12.980 --> 01:46:22.900
Um, so because of that, they ended up walking back that patch 1.21 and yeah, no word on

01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:29.500
when it's going to be fixed yet, but that's kind of unfortunate that this had to happen.

01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:35.820
You'd think that they would have, uh, tested some more stuff, but I guess, I guess not.

01:46:35.820 --> 01:46:36.820
Yeah.

01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:41.340
Uh, sounds like Red Dead Online keeps having these issues and it's probably, I know it's

01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:44.980
been irritating you and, and a lot of people out there on the internet, cause it's kind

01:46:44.980 --> 01:46:50.160
of like, it's just making the game seem cheaper and like this was supposed to be a much bigger

01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:54.360
and badder game than what it, the online components turned into, right?

01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:56.160
They better, they better watch out.

01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:00.160
Any bug here and Todd Howard's going to try to re-release it for the fifth time.

01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:02.840
So I don't know.

01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:05.000
Watch out.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:10.080
Speaking of which, uh, bugs and such Bethesda, a quick follow up to something we talked about

01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:13.640
on last week's show, Quake 2 was free on the launcher this week.

01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:19.480
And I think it might still be if, uh, uh, Ragenator is still out there listening somewhere.

01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:24.720
I think Quake 2 is still free on the Bethesda launcher because I know Quake 3, which is

01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:29.560
like the superior Quake, it takes over, I think tomorrow, uh, and will be free on the

01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:31.080
Bethesda launcher for a week.

01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:35.320
So that's exciting, which is, I mean, I already own Quake 3 on Steam cause I think I bought

01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:38.520
it for like five bucks, probably like 10 years ago on Steam.

01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:41.600
Uh, but Quake 3 really is like the best Quake.

01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:43.560
It's a lot, that's a really fun PVP as well.

01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:47.240
So just a quick follow up tips since we were talking about buggy games that made me remember,

01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:48.740
Oh yeah, Bethesda.

01:47:48.740 --> 01:47:51.340
So all right.

01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:55.900
As as does have, did you know though, I didn't know this, um, the Bethesda launcher since

01:47:55.900 --> 01:48:00.660
I've never really used it before and this was, ain't nothing for free, right?

01:48:00.660 --> 01:48:02.440
This is exactly what Bethesda wanted.

01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:05.780
I'm going to go in and look around the launcher and see what else is there.

01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:13.020
I didn't realize they put out like official Skyrim mod making tools, uh, as well as Fallout

01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:15.700
4 that like you can design your own quests and stuff.

01:48:15.700 --> 01:48:18.380
Yeah, that was a long time ago.

01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:24.220
So they, I never realized it was the same tool that they use to make quests that they

01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:26.920
put out, which I thought was interesting.

01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:31.420
So they, they did that in the sense that that was back when they had those enhancements

01:48:31.420 --> 01:48:34.980
that they were adding to the game, the paid mods basically.

01:48:34.980 --> 01:48:40.980
So the thing was, Oh yeah, you can release your mods through the, um, Bethesda storefront

01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:42.100
or whatever.

01:48:42.100 --> 01:48:44.640
And then also you could, um, sell them.

01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:48.280
I think you could sell them as well through there as well.

01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:54.800
Um, but I know then they turn to sell a lot of those mods as well through the storefront.

01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:59.600
And that's how you get like, you know, where skin in the game costs like 20 bucks.

01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:00.600
It's ridiculous.

01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:05.680
Um, but yeah, I know that stuff's available, but I, I'm sure that there's other tool sets

01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:10.560
out there that aren't official that worked just as well because there was lots of bots

01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:12.320
before that whole thing came out.

01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:14.320
So they had to do it somehow.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:21.000
All right, well moving on, uh, Twitch Prime is no more and that's because it's been rebranded.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.860
So Twitch Prime is now Prime Gaming.

01:49:23.860 --> 01:49:28.600
And that happened earlier this week where, uh, Amazon who of course is over Twitch, uh,

01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:34.100
rebranded all of the perks that you're used to getting with Twitch Prime under Prime Gaming.

01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:39.520
This is probably to come in line with services like Prime Video, Prime Reading and Prime

01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:40.520
Gaming.

01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:42.320
Otherwise they haven't really made a lot of changes to it.

01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:48.320
You still get your free subscription to a channel, which I would be a bad broadcaster

01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:52.560
if I didn't try to encourage you to use that free one right here at VOG Network where you

01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:56.760
get access to our video archives to watch on demand whenever you want.

01:49:56.760 --> 01:50:01.320
If you can't be here on Sunday night, our subscribers, whether it's through the free

01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:04.160
Prime Gaming subscription or through a $5 sub.

01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:08.640
And I think the subs might actually be, I saw that subs were discounted for first timers.

01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:12.440
They might be running a free promotion right now, or not free, but like a promotion of

01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:13.440
sorts right now.

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:16.080
So I look into that cause I was checking that out for the show.

01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:18.680
But anyway, uh, you get access to the full video archives.

01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:24.360
Of course the podcast, the audio still free as it's been for 18 years.

01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:30.000
We did not charge for anything that we, um, we're always giving away for free that is

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.600
staying free.

01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:36.820
So um, anyway, yeah, so Prime Gaming is, is it now, um, that's the one that gets you some

01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:40.340
game perks as well and some, uh, stuff in games.

01:50:40.340 --> 01:50:45.980
Um, I can't say we're all going to be quick to remember this rebranding and I'm probably

01:50:45.980 --> 01:50:50.620
still going to say Twitch Prime, your Twitch Prime account and all that, uh, because I've

01:50:50.620 --> 01:50:54.900
just, you say one thing for so many years, it takes a little while to get used to it.

01:50:54.900 --> 01:50:57.860
I'm sure there'll be a lot of broadcasters in the same boat.

01:50:57.860 --> 01:51:01.400
Um, but that's, uh, that's just part of the switch there.

01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:02.400
You know what we mean?

01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:03.400
You know?

01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:04.400
Exactly.

01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:05.400
You know what we mean?

01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:09.080
Jeff says, yeah, there's a promotion, I think, and streamers get more for Prime subs.

01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:10.680
Oh, is that true?

01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:14.640
Well then you should really consider using that one.

01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:15.640
I have to try.

01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:20.220
I'm a bad broadcaster if I know, but you know what, Hey, if you don't even give us a dime,

01:51:20.220 --> 01:51:21.220
that is okay too.

01:51:21.220 --> 01:51:22.220
I understand.

01:51:22.220 --> 01:51:27.140
Uh, especially in these times, money is hard to come by, but, uh, we do use money to make

01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:30.420
improvements to the show and there'll be more coming later on.

01:51:30.420 --> 01:51:31.420
So all right.

01:51:31.420 --> 01:51:32.420
Yeah.

01:51:33.420 --> 01:51:37.780
How many times did we say all games radio by accident after moving to vog or how many

01:51:37.780 --> 01:51:43.960
times did I say, and you can join our chat at a game surge or whatever, or a live dot

01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:44.960
vog network.com.

01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:52.080
I still say that just out of habit, mail bag at orange, which is the old email.

01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:53.080
Don't use it.

01:51:53.080 --> 01:51:54.720
It'll bounce participate at orange laundry.

01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:57.640
Do.com is the place to send those emails.

01:51:57.640 --> 01:51:58.640
All right.

01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:02.180
Let's move on some more things before we get to our listener round table.

01:52:02.180 --> 01:52:03.180
Loki.

01:52:03.180 --> 01:52:04.180
Yes.

01:52:04.180 --> 01:52:09.420
So, you know, it seems like there's so many art, little mini arcade cabinets coming out.

01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:11.200
I can't keep track of all of them.

01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:15.160
Well now there's another, uh, Neo Geo arcade home machine.

01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:20.500
So this is not quite the super mini one that they had, but this is more of like your arcade

01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:22.380
one up bar top type cabinets.

01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:25.200
So it's going to run $500.

01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:30.080
However, unlike you would get with say an arcade one up cabinet, there's going to be

01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:33.740
a few more games in there, 50 games total.

01:52:33.740 --> 01:52:41.480
So all your favorites from the SNK and the Neo Geo.

01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:45.360
And they also have a stand you can get as well.

01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:49.660
That kind of turns into an upright cabinet, although it looks kind of strange, but still

01:52:49.660 --> 01:52:56.480
pretty slick looking, um, and the stand itself as an extra 50 bucks, that's not bad.

01:52:56.480 --> 01:52:57.480
Yeah.

01:52:57.480 --> 01:52:59.340
I have to say I'm kind of interested.

01:52:59.340 --> 01:53:03.660
One person that's not interested in our chat room, Bobby Black Wolf, who says I was excited

01:53:03.660 --> 01:53:07.240
about this until I saw it did not have bust to move.

01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:09.360
That was literally the only game I was interested in.

01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:15.060
Um, yeah, I love that game, but there's other games, uh, that, that SNK did that I'd be

01:53:15.060 --> 01:53:16.060
okay with.

01:53:16.060 --> 01:53:21.400
So, um, it does sound very interesting to me, uh, as Joe and her mat says, I like this

01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:26.720
Neo Geo cab act F says, I really love the Neo Geo cab, uh, and SJ one on a mat says

01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:29.460
it's an SNK fighting game gamer's dream.

01:53:29.460 --> 01:53:33.620
You know, they had that other little Neo Geo cab not that long ago.

01:53:33.620 --> 01:53:37.800
Um, and so it's interesting that they're kind of doing another one that's just bigger and

01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:40.500
a little more inspired by the arcade one up stuff.

01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:45.780
As long as I could put it into like a four game mode or whatever that has it cycle through

01:53:45.780 --> 01:53:53.280
those like it used to with the arcade cabinet that used to be in the, uh, like, uh, grocery

01:53:53.280 --> 01:54:00.660
store I used to go to needs to have like baseball stars, magician, Lord, and I want to say metal

01:54:00.660 --> 01:54:02.140
slug in there.

01:54:02.140 --> 01:54:03.820
Probably metal slug.

01:54:03.820 --> 01:54:06.860
I think it was also like art of fatal fury or something in there.

01:54:06.860 --> 01:54:08.920
I also, I can't think of the game in the moment.

01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:10.020
There was another puzzle game.

01:54:10.020 --> 01:54:12.740
So you may be angry about bust to move, not being there.

01:54:12.740 --> 01:54:13.740
Puzzle de Pawn.

01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:14.740
I love that.

01:54:14.780 --> 01:54:17.980
Is that a puzzle de Pawn where you pull the balls down and you throw the balls back up

01:54:17.980 --> 01:54:22.820
in the matching colors that's puzzled upon, uh, puzzle de Pawn is kind of like a bust

01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:26.180
to move sort of thing, but that was the one that I used to play all the time.

01:54:26.180 --> 01:54:29.700
There's one where you, I can't remember the name in the moment you pull the balls down

01:54:29.700 --> 01:54:33.020
and then you go run over to the column with the matching ones and throw them back up.

01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:35.220
And I can't remember the name of it, but that was an SNK one too.

01:54:35.220 --> 01:54:36.220
I don't know.

01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:39.100
I don't know what that one was, but yeah, the one I used to play that was like a bust

01:54:39.100 --> 01:54:41.500
to move with puzzle de Pawn.

01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:42.500
Okay.

01:54:42.740 --> 01:54:44.540
And is that on the cab?

01:54:44.540 --> 01:54:46.740
No, there's not very many.

01:54:46.740 --> 01:54:47.740
Thank you.

01:54:47.740 --> 01:54:49.140
Dark to see a magical drop.

01:54:49.140 --> 01:54:50.140
That's it.

01:54:50.140 --> 01:54:51.140
Thank you.

01:54:51.140 --> 01:54:52.140
Yeah.

01:54:52.140 --> 01:54:53.140
Yeah.

01:54:53.140 --> 01:54:55.700
It's mostly, it looks like it's mostly fighting games, metal slug, and they have a couple

01:54:55.700 --> 01:54:57.020
of like sports games on there.

01:54:57.020 --> 01:55:02.940
So baseball stars, football frenzy, top player or top players, golf and super sidekicks.

01:55:02.940 --> 01:55:07.900
Um, but the most, most of it is looks like just fighting.

01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:11.300
In fact, I'd say 90% of it is fighting games.

01:55:11.300 --> 01:55:12.300
Kind of disappointing.

01:55:12.300 --> 01:55:16.340
I mean, I get it, but like, I would hope that there's more of a variety of stuff.

01:55:16.340 --> 01:55:19.540
Maybe because maybe a lot of that's third party.

01:55:19.540 --> 01:55:20.660
I don't know.

01:55:20.660 --> 01:55:27.100
I'm just used to my, my, was it not Pandora's box, but I have a not quite legit multi-cart

01:55:27.100 --> 01:55:28.460
that now Bobby owns.

01:55:28.460 --> 01:55:32.900
Uh, they had like a ton of like games on the puzzle de Pawn was one I did play on there.

01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:35.260
One of the first games I played on my arcade cabinet.

01:55:35.260 --> 01:55:36.260
Nice.

01:55:36.260 --> 01:55:37.260
All right.

01:55:37.260 --> 01:55:38.260
One more story for you guys.

01:55:38.260 --> 01:55:44.180
And it's about, uh, an event for next year already making changes, uh, because of, you

01:55:44.180 --> 01:55:46.740
know, potentially COVID and related things.

01:55:46.740 --> 01:55:51.860
And it's the game developers conference or GDC number one, they've pushed it way back.

01:55:51.860 --> 01:55:57.060
So GDC next year is going to be in July, July 19th through 23rd.

01:55:57.060 --> 01:55:58.660
That's after E3.

01:55:58.660 --> 01:56:00.260
That's not where they're usually at.

01:56:00.260 --> 01:56:03.360
GDC was usually a March thing, if I remember right.

01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:05.620
So they're pushing it way back for next year.

01:56:05.620 --> 01:56:10.640
So they must really be banking on, you know, there's going to be a vaccine or something,

01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:14.900
but even with all that, they're saying it's going to be a scaled down edition of the live

01:56:14.900 --> 01:56:15.900
show.

01:56:15.900 --> 01:56:18.900
They will have it at the Moscone center in San Francisco where they usually have it,

01:56:18.900 --> 01:56:21.780
but there will also be an online showcase.

01:56:21.780 --> 01:56:23.380
So it's going to be a little bit of a hybrid event.

01:56:23.380 --> 01:56:28.740
Uh, there's going to be publishers and developers showing things online as well as face to face.

01:56:28.740 --> 01:56:33.140
Um, there's no official comment that this is because of COVID.

01:56:33.140 --> 01:56:36.020
Um, that's kind of what's being inferred.

01:56:36.020 --> 01:56:39.460
People are assuming that, you know, there might still be issues related to COVID, or

01:56:39.460 --> 01:56:43.100
maybe we just won't be ready for the gigantic crowds at that point, you know, because it's

01:56:43.100 --> 01:56:46.220
going to take time to get a lot of people vaccinated and then there's going to be people

01:56:46.220 --> 01:56:49.980
that aren't going to get vaccinated because they're going to be like, oh, it's inserting

01:56:49.980 --> 01:56:53.940
a microchip in my brain and all this stuff, whatever, whatever.

01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:54.940
Anyway.

01:56:54.940 --> 01:57:00.060
So, um, you know, there's, it's going to take a little time probably, you know, these huge

01:57:00.060 --> 01:57:02.540
events are going to be the last thing to come back.

01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:07.180
So I can see why they're kind of, you know, doing a little bit of both.

01:57:07.180 --> 01:57:11.980
Um, so, and, and also, it also makes sense that if things were to happen and things were

01:57:11.980 --> 01:57:15.940
still in a bad place, I mean, heaven forbid, but if things were still in a bad place in

01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:20.860
July of next year, they would have the digital thing to fall back on.

01:57:20.860 --> 01:57:22.340
So there's that too.

01:57:22.340 --> 01:57:27.980
Uh, Pixel Pacas points out this year's GDC was a few weeks ago fully online.

01:57:27.980 --> 01:57:32.180
The system worked pretty well, but wasn't great for networking in my opinion, that comment

01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:34.700
from our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:57:34.700 --> 01:57:36.980
I didn't realize they even finally had it online.

01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:40.520
A lot of these digital events aren't promoting very well, but then again, I'm also not the

01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:42.020
audience for GDC.

01:57:42.020 --> 01:57:43.780
Pixel Pacas is the audience for GDC.

01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:44.780
I'm not.

01:57:44.780 --> 01:57:49.940
So, uh, that might be why so, um, but, uh, it's interesting a few weeks ago would be

01:57:49.940 --> 01:57:52.100
around the same timeframe end of July.

01:57:52.100 --> 01:58:00.980
So there is that, um, let's see, um, there will still be master classes that GDC is going

01:58:00.980 --> 01:58:05.780
to do virtually for the rest of 2020, uh, they are courses that are intended to tutor

01:58:05.780 --> 01:58:10.660
devs on various aspects of game design, and there'll be more info on that, uh, over the

01:58:10.660 --> 01:58:11.660
coming weeks.

01:58:11.660 --> 01:58:19.780
So again, GDC next year, July 19th through the 23rd, hopefully in person and online,

01:58:19.780 --> 01:58:21.980
we're going to cross our fingers and our toes.

01:58:21.980 --> 01:58:23.800
I can't imagine another year of this.

01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:28.900
I think that people are, I mean, it's already happening where people are like, I can't do

01:58:28.900 --> 01:58:30.260
this quarantine thing anymore.

01:58:30.260 --> 01:58:35.620
I'm just going to let go and let God and, uh, who cares who I put at risk and I that's

01:58:35.620 --> 01:58:37.580
only going to get worse the longer this goes on.

01:58:37.580 --> 01:58:42.420
So fingers and toes crossed that they, they have a miracle on the vaccine front.

01:58:42.420 --> 01:58:43.420
That's for sure.

01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:44.420
All right.

01:58:44.420 --> 01:58:48.300
Well, at this point, we're going to open up the chat for any topics that we might've missed

01:58:48.300 --> 01:58:49.300
throughout the show.

01:58:49.300 --> 01:58:53.620
I know we're a little, uh, early tonight, but that also happens, uh, when we're down

01:58:53.620 --> 01:58:55.500
a host and dark soccer is not here tonight.

01:58:55.500 --> 01:58:59.420
Um, I will in the meantime, look to Loki to see if we have any last minute stories tonight,

01:58:59.420 --> 01:59:02.780
but if you have something you want to ask or have us talk about, please go to our chat

01:59:02.780 --> 01:59:05.660
over twitch.tv slash a VOG network.

01:59:05.660 --> 01:59:08.060
Um, okay.

01:59:08.060 --> 01:59:09.060
So let's see.

01:59:09.060 --> 01:59:10.060
Yeah.

01:59:10.060 --> 01:59:15.500
We've got, there's a techno attached in a drum and fun, apparently e-sports turn mode,

01:59:15.500 --> 01:59:20.060
uh, which is going to be launching on August 19th.

01:59:20.060 --> 01:59:21.060
So that's cool.

01:59:21.060 --> 01:59:23.740
Is that the PS or PS four version?

01:59:23.740 --> 01:59:29.340
Uh, I don't know if that is, or it sounds like it's for the switch.

01:59:29.340 --> 01:59:31.380
Oh, okay.

01:59:31.380 --> 01:59:34.940
So I'm assuming in Japan, but yeah, that's pretty cool that they have like an e-sports

01:59:34.940 --> 01:59:36.940
mode to that.

01:59:36.940 --> 01:59:43.580
Um, let's see what else we got.

01:59:43.580 --> 01:59:46.020
There is a, they're making a new GI Joe game.

01:59:46.020 --> 01:59:52.460
So GI Joe operation blackout it's coming out on the PlayStation four X-Box one and switch

01:59:52.460 --> 01:59:53.460
that's out of nowhere.

01:59:53.460 --> 01:59:57.880
Is that going to be based off of the, the game or hopefully God, I hope they're not

01:59:57.880 --> 02:00:02.320
making another movie that looks not great.

02:00:02.320 --> 02:00:08.840
Can I get a remake of like an NES or super NES game or arcade game?

02:00:08.840 --> 02:00:10.320
I think that'd be better.

02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:11.320
Wow.

02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:15.600
This looks generic is hell actually, you know what it reminds me of?

02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:18.360
It reminds me of a flood, a far cry blood dragon.

02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:21.320
Cause it's all neon the hell out.

02:00:21.320 --> 02:00:23.520
Uh, that's what it really looks like.

02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:27.840
That's a game we need a sequel to, uh, dark to see you in our chat over twitch.tv.

02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:32.960
Slash vog network says I picked up cosmic star heroin on the switch.

02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:34.880
It was on sale for super cheap.

02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:38.840
It feels heavily inspired by the square Enix classic chrono trigger.

02:00:38.840 --> 02:00:40.400
I highly recommend it.

02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:42.360
Uh, quest buster says, LOL.

02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:44.680
I saw the trailer for the GI Joe game.

02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:50.400
It just came out of nowhere and isn't based on anything upcoming as far as I know.

02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:53.240
They just want to sell more toys.

02:00:53.240 --> 02:01:00.560
So I, I, uh, forwarded my wife some videos of, um, there's a, one of the, a couple like

02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:08.760
a YouTuber that does fake animal crossing quality of life update announcement videos.

02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:09.760
Oh yeah.

02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:10.760
I saw it.

02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:11.760
Yeah.

02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:12.760
Anger is the hell out of me.

02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:14.160
Cause I'm like, why don't they have that?

02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:15.160
Oh yeah.

02:01:15.160 --> 02:01:20.800
Um, there's so much like just watching her play it like, I don't know what the hell they're

02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:23.200
thinking sometimes with just the way to design it.

02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:27.080
So it's like some of the issues, like, especially like with, you know, digging a hole or something

02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:31.000
like that and, you know, trying to line up the right spot in it, that's been a problem

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.040
for like since the beginning.

02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:34.920
And why hasn't that been fixed?

02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:38.760
Like some of the stuff you don't really think about because like, Oh, animal, look at all

02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:42.080
the stuff that they added, but it's like, Oh my God, there's so much that could be improved

02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:43.080
with that.

02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:45.960
There's a great, I think it's a tick talk or something like that, that Alan showed me.

02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:48.360
And I think he posted it on your wife's page this way too.

02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:49.360
I don't have Facebook anymore.

02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:52.240
So no, but I think he posted it on your wife's page.

02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:56.480
It was this guy and he like is like trying to aim the shovel and then he goes and knocks

02:01:56.480 --> 02:01:57.480
over the table.

02:01:57.480 --> 02:01:58.480
I did that.

02:01:58.480 --> 02:01:59.480
Yeah.

02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:00.480
That's Gus Johnson.

02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:01.480
So yeah.

02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:02.480
Okay.

02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:03.480
Really funny.

02:02:03.480 --> 02:02:04.480
A YouTuber.

02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:05.480
But yeah, he did.

02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:07.280
He does these little short videos, but that was one day I posted on her wall.

02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:08.280
Um, okay.

02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:09.280
Okay.

02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:10.280
But yeah, that's hilarious.

02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:15.040
And it perfectly illustrates animal crossing sometimes just because some of the things

02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:19.880
we're trying to do, like she's trying to build a staircase between, um, the two of

02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:21.420
the buildings in the game.

02:02:21.420 --> 02:02:24.120
And for whatever reason, it just would not let her do it.

02:02:24.120 --> 02:02:28.300
It's like, sorry, there's not enough space to, you know, I don't know, this, this cliff

02:02:28.300 --> 02:02:31.160
doesn't look even enough where we're going to put stairs here.

02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:33.040
And it's like, right there, right there.

02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:35.480
It's like, why won't you work?

02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:40.960
Uh, um, Bobby in chat says they don't, Bobby and chat says they don't consider it broken.

02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:42.000
That's why they haven't fixed it.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:47.320
Animal crossing has sold almost more than any other switch game at this point.

02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:49.680
So what, what's their motivation to fix it.

02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:53.400
Although we do know there is a, there's a fall update coming.

02:02:53.400 --> 02:02:56.200
Maybe some things will be addressed, but I'm not going to hold my breath.

02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:59.280
But just some quality of life stuff like in the stuff that was in those views wasn't like

02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:00.600
ridiculous things.

02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:04.580
It was like, Hey, you know why say you want to craft two of something.

02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:10.880
You can select the quantity or like, how about, you know, um, the ability to see your storage

02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:17.760
where you're aiming, you know, just a crafting from your storage, like not ridiculous things,

02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:22.180
like things that I would see without having any knowledge of how they construct that game

02:03:22.180 --> 02:03:24.160
that shouldn't be too hard to implement.

02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:27.320
Like I get it that you're not going to be able to do everything that everybody wants,

02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:31.840
but like some of this stuff is an unreasonable and when make things a little bit better.

02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:34.100
Let me, let me ask this related question.

02:03:34.100 --> 02:03:36.320
So obviously your wife is still playing animal crossing.

02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:38.200
Are you.

02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:44.320
I did the other day just to, um, cause I have, you know, the online access.

02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:46.480
So I did the download some designs.

02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:49.920
Unfortunately, my youngest son was the one that played the game first.

02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:54.960
So he is running the town and also I had to play the other day because he made my birthday

02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:57.320
August 9th for some reason.

02:03:57.320 --> 02:04:03.040
So, um, so I had to do my birthday stuff.

02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:04.600
He got the nine, right?

02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:05.600
Kinda.

02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:09.560
It's just the month, sorta, sorta close.

02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:14.320
So I had to, I had to do the, um, birthday stuff, you know, for that.

02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:17.880
Um, but yeah, no, it isn't night.

02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:18.880
I don't know.

02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:19.880
I did it, uh, today.

02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:23.780
Maybe when she just time traveling, I don't remember, but yeah, so I had to do the birthday

02:04:23.780 --> 02:04:27.120
stuff early and, um, yeah.

02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:30.060
And then the download, the patterns off the internet.

02:04:30.060 --> 02:04:34.080
So we were downloading some patterns so she can trick it out and stuff.

02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:38.080
But yeah, it's, I don't really play it.

02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:43.640
Um, Bobby is, is putting several comments in chat, essentially, uh, summarizing, uh,

02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:49.200
if you haven't seen the code is coded, then you don't know if it's easy or not to fix.

02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:55.440
Um, and you know, maybe, maybe Nintendo, I think the thing is people are spoiled, you

02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:57.800
know, and we say this a lot.

02:04:57.800 --> 02:04:59.840
Perception is everything, right?

02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:02.840
So what you're saying, those are probably the facts.

02:05:02.840 --> 02:05:08.740
You know, I, the fact they likely are the facts, but perception is everything.

02:05:08.740 --> 02:05:13.440
And when other games do these quality of life things they do online in a different way or

02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:16.880
they do the regular updates, they do such and such thing.

02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:20.520
It kind of, that's why people go, well, why can't Nintendo just do it this way?

02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:21.920
Because other companies are doing it.

02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:25.760
And I'm not saying, I'm not saying I disagree with what you're saying, but it's just like

02:05:25.760 --> 02:05:30.040
that perception is very, very big is that other game companies do make it look easy

02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:35.380
sometimes and probably because they do see the benefit in putting the resources into

02:05:35.380 --> 02:05:36.380
it.

02:05:36.380 --> 02:05:40.660
I, but again, I don't think everything on the wishlist, you know, there are some things

02:05:40.660 --> 02:05:44.100
in there where even I'm like, well, that's going to be really hard for them to go back

02:05:44.100 --> 02:05:50.040
and do, but I think there's a, there's a few things in there that again, other games made

02:05:50.040 --> 02:05:53.520
it look easy, but I guess we don't really know cause we can't see Nintendo's code.

02:05:53.520 --> 02:05:58.160
Um, just like seeing, yeah, just seeing where you're aiming, obviously the game is doing

02:05:58.160 --> 02:06:03.840
some sort of rate cast calculation for where you're aiming your shovel or whatever it is,

02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:06.520
item trying to put it down and stuff like that.

02:06:06.520 --> 02:06:11.360
And I mean, obviously it's figuring out which space it's going in because it already knows

02:06:11.360 --> 02:06:15.920
when you put it down or do it, you know, dig or whatever, just show that display it.

02:06:15.920 --> 02:06:20.080
I mean, I don't see why that would be a problem, but I get it.

02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:21.080
I mean, that's fine.

02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:22.080
Whatever they're going to do.

02:06:22.080 --> 02:06:27.680
They're the aim selling well, so I guess maybe they're not motivated to improve it more like

02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:28.680
that.

02:06:28.680 --> 02:06:29.680
We'll see what they come up with.

02:06:29.680 --> 02:06:34.160
Or we'll see what the fall update has because they, you know, there are still changes coming

02:06:34.160 --> 02:06:38.320
and everything that we've gotten so far has been more of like a small event.

02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:41.320
Like they've been like, they've been patching in a holiday or patching this thing, but this

02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:43.480
fall event, they're kind of teasing us a bigger thing.

02:06:43.480 --> 02:06:46.520
So we might, I mean, I don't want to set false expectation, I'm not going to put the bar

02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:51.960
too high, but we might get some of it in the fall update, maybe the low hanging fruit,

02:06:51.960 --> 02:06:54.680
so to speak of this code that we can't see.

02:06:54.680 --> 02:06:55.680
All right.

02:06:56.680 --> 02:07:01.440
SG100Matt says Def Jam has been teasing a new or remake of Def Jam Vendetta or Fight

02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:02.440
for New York.

02:07:02.440 --> 02:07:05.460
They tweeted out the other day that if they hit 1 million on their Twitter, they will

02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:08.920
have a special announcement with a picture of Vendetta.

02:07:08.920 --> 02:07:09.920
Hmm.

02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:10.920
Interesting.

02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:14.560
Pissalpaca says, did they ever post the follow up because they've had a million followers

02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:15.560
for days.

02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:19.320
Well, we're we're waiting.

02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:20.640
Probably check back Monday.

02:07:20.640 --> 02:07:22.200
It is the weekend after all.

02:07:22.720 --> 02:07:23.720
All right.

02:07:23.720 --> 02:07:25.160
Any other last minute stories, Logie?

02:07:25.160 --> 02:07:26.800
No, that's all I had.

02:07:26.800 --> 02:07:27.800
All right.

02:07:27.800 --> 02:07:29.720
Then I think we'll go ahead and wrap things up for the night.

02:07:29.720 --> 02:07:33.960
Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show, whether you were here live or you were

02:07:33.960 --> 02:07:35.240
on our podcast.

02:07:35.240 --> 02:07:38.160
We really appreciate you participating with our show.

02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:40.640
Send us an email, say hello to us that way.

02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:42.680
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:07:42.680 --> 02:07:47.400
We're also on social media, on Twitter over at OLR.

02:07:47.400 --> 02:07:50.560
And yeah, we'll be back in seven days to do this all over again.

02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:53.360
If you wouldn't mind helping us spread the word, we are the show where every gamer has

02:07:53.360 --> 02:07:54.360
a voice.

02:07:54.360 --> 02:07:57.200
But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, we're missing that.

02:07:57.200 --> 02:07:59.960
So tell a friend or two about the show, help us spread the word.

02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:03.760
An auto host on Twitch goes a real long way.

02:08:03.760 --> 02:08:08.460
A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this podcast.

02:08:08.460 --> 02:08:09.660
Those go a long way as well.

02:08:09.660 --> 02:08:12.960
We really appreciate those word of mouth things.

02:08:12.960 --> 02:08:15.920
That all being said, let's wrap up and get final thoughts.

02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:19.040
Dark Sakura will be here next week.

02:08:19.040 --> 02:08:25.320
We'll see you guys then with Jamie and whatever should happen in the industry this week.

02:08:25.320 --> 02:08:28.260
Maybe we'll get some big announcements about these consoles, who knows?

02:08:28.260 --> 02:08:31.480
Or maybe we'll have more reasons to come back and say, you know what, fuck you and fuck

02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:32.480
you and fuck you.

02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:33.760
We'll see what happens.

02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:36.440
Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:43.160
I'm going to keep working on making something or learning more stuff.

02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:44.160
I don't know.

02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:46.200
But yeah, I'm going to keep working on stuff.

02:08:46.200 --> 02:08:51.440
Hopefully I made something that technically is a game, but technically it's such a short

02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:55.640
following a tutorial that I don't really count that.

02:08:55.640 --> 02:08:59.480
Well it's something, you got to start somewhere.

02:08:59.480 --> 02:09:01.000
It's one little step.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:02.000
Yay.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:03.000
All right.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:04.000
Cool.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:05.240
All right.

02:09:05.240 --> 02:09:06.240
My final thought.

02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:07.240
I don't have a lot.

02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:11.400
You know, good luck to Bobby with Summer Games done quick and looking forward to Virtual

02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:13.760
Dragon Con as well.

02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:18.900
And yeah, let's just keep wearing our masks and social distance and do everything we can

02:09:18.900 --> 02:09:24.680
to try to lessen the spread of COVID so we can get back to real life and events like

02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:31.200
GDC and all the other things we miss where 2020 has just kind of ruined all of that.

02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:36.680
And also stay cool and stay hydrated, especially those of you in California.

02:09:36.680 --> 02:09:38.480
This heat wave is going to get worse.

02:09:38.480 --> 02:09:40.120
Tuesday is going to be real bad.

02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:41.720
The number keeps going up and down.

02:09:41.720 --> 02:09:46.000
It was at 114 at one point and I was like, what the fuck?

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:47.200
But I think it's down to like one or nine.

02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:50.920
I think this cloud and the rains and all this stuff that's happened, maybe put it down.

02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:53.160
But yeah, that's yikes.

02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:55.520
So anyway, stay hydrated.

02:09:55.520 --> 02:09:58.480
Because seriously, I was out at like eight in the morning.

02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:00.200
I was doing my cemetery portal scanning.

02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:05.960
I talked about a couple of weeks ago on the show and by like 930 I was done and I was

02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:09.840
already feeling a little bit like, why am I just so exhausted?

02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:11.640
I had to drink a lot of water.

02:10:11.640 --> 02:10:15.880
So yeah, I've been trying to be real good about my walking, but I'm going to take a

02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:16.880
break for a few days.

02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:17.880
I have to.

02:10:17.880 --> 02:10:19.120
It's just too damn hot.

02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:21.520
So stay inside, play some video games.

02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:22.800
That'll be fun too.

02:10:22.800 --> 02:10:24.440
So we will see you next week, everybody.

02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:25.440
Good night.

02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:26.440
Thanks for listening.
