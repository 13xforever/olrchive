00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,520
While reading the news on big gaming websites, I had the all too often, please accept our

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,880
marketing cookies spiel.

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,520
The text says we use these cookies for advertising and may be shared, but then the media on the

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,680
page require tracking cookies be enabled.

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,060
This is deliberate misdirection from a deliberate choice, and it's a bad one.

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,220
Privacy principles exist for a reason, and sites that hide significant detail behind

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,460
some obnoxious agreement will fail faster.

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,060
This is my 20 seconds of activism.

9
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,600
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to carry on with the

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,220
actual news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:47,340
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,300
every gamer has a voice.

13
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:57,100
It is Orange Lounge Radio Live once again tonight with episode number 834 for this August

14
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,020
the 30th of 2020.

15
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:05,000
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm joined here as I usually am via the magic of Discord by

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,980
DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

17
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:07,980
Hello.

18
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,980
Hi.

19
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:09,980
How are you doing?

20
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:10,980
I'm alright.

21
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:11,980
Yeah.

22
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,980
It's been quite a week.

23
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,980
Yeah.

24
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,980
It's been emotional and difficult.

25
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:18,980
Absolutely.

26
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:19,980
Absolutely.

27
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,080
You know, and I think, you know, again, I know we talk about video games, but there's

28
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,980
a lot of other stuff that happens in the world too, and right at the top of last week's show,

29
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,700
we were kind of talking about the great loss that, you know, we were, you and I were feeling

30
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,320
with the drag community and the loss of Chi Chi Devane, right?

31
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,780
And now just, you know, days ago, we're getting this news about, you know, we lost Chadwick

32
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:46,620
Boseman, which was a shock to obviously a lot of people because, you know, he had kept

33
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,660
his illness and what he was battling for four years, a secret, which he had every right

34
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,200
to do, obviously, and, you know, obviously, but now it's like you go back and you look

35
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,740
at everything that he was doing with those movies and, you know, visiting the kids and

36
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,840
the hospitals and everything, and just the stuff he was doing for, you know, the black

37
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,460
community and, you know, the things he contributed to the Marvel universe and just everything

38
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,860
he was doing.

39
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,860
And he was battling that.

40
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,860
He was the embodiment of representation.

41
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,860
Mm-hmm.

42
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:21,660
I mean, and he was the embodiment of like a good person and just to lose that is horrible.

43
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:29,040
Not just as a black man, but also for invisible illnesses, because he did hide it very well.

44
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,040
Yeah.

45
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,040
There's a lot of us who are suffering.

46
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,240
I mean, the same thing actually a few years ago happened with Liz Slaton of Doctor Who.

47
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,020
She was Sarah Jane Smith.

48
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:44,520
But I mean, of course, you know, the representation issue is not the same, but I'm saying that

49
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,100
you shouldn't assume something about somebody because they appear to be able-bodied.

50
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:56,440
You know, if someone says, I have this issue, just believe them and act accordingly.

51
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,000
And he didn't even say anything.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,160
So that was, I don't know.

53
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,800
Kelly Preston was another example of that as well.

54
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,800
Yeah.

55
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
Yeah.

56
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
Yeah.

57
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,080
Had passed away with battling cancer.

58
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,780
So just a big, hearty fuck cancer here at the top of the show.

59
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,240
And that's just such a tremendous loss.

60
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,140
I mean, I can't claim to be the person that's there every weekend when a new Marvel movie

61
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,540
opens.

62
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:29,920
But at the same time, I do see like how Chadwick Boseman was so important to so many people.

63
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,020
And it's just, this is a year.

64
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,020
This is a year.

65
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,060
I just, I don't know what else to say.

66
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,380
All right.

67
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,380
So the difficult transition to also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

68
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,380
How are you?

69
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,380
Hello.

70
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,380
I'm fine.

71
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,520
Say something funny.

72
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,840
We've got to try to change the tone a little bit before we get into games.

73
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,840
I know.

74
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,480
How about that animal crossing stream we did earlier this week?

75
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,480
That was a lot of fun.

76
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
Right?

77
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
Yeah.

78
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,480
Yeah.

79
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,480
I wasn't, you know, I had built that whole thing.

80
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,560
It's like a Jamie and Rob show.

81
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,480
I didn't know you would be as into it as you were.

82
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,880
I didn't, uh, but it wasn't just you really.

83
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,640
It was, you know, Nelly was in the background.

84
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,480
You could hear her and your kid, one of your kids was there too.

85
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,480
Yes.

86
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,480
Yes.

87
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,920
The two that actually play the game.

88
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,360
We're kind of leading the tour.

89
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,340
That stream was a lot of fun though.

90
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,340
I'm glad we did it.

91
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,580
Um, if you don't know what we're talking about, uh, of course, uh, we do, well, we taped this

92
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:26,460
show orange launch radio live every week at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash

93
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:31,100
a VOG network or VOG network Sunday nights at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern,

94
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,500
right after the Bobby black Wolf show.

95
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:38,260
But sometimes we do some other things on the network and this was one of those experimental

96
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,260
things.

97
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,380
So Thursday night we did like a special live show.

98
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,860
Uh, and we, it was actually like two hours.

99
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,840
We spent playing animal crossing and just looking at all the creativity on your guys's

100
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,480
islands, uh, was, was really amazing.

101
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,760
Uh, dark soccer, your Island is, is so cool.

102
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,320
And um, thank you.

103
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,080
And Loki yours is too, especially when you consider how much your kid contributed to

104
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,680
that is, uh, you know, I kept joking like it's mostly Nelly.

105
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,680
All right.

106
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,400
Well, they said, don't, don't, don't sell the kids by the way.

107
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Oh, you're welcome.

108
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Yeah, no problem.

109
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,580
And thank you for the stuff.

110
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,500
Cause I got the posters and stuff afterwards.

111
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,020
Anyway, I forgot what I was supposed to some Loki though, or what Nelly wanted.

112
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,020
She wanted the fruit.

113
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:24,860
We got her all up on the fruit and then, um, I don't remember.

114
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,980
I know my son wanted like one of those like 3d wallpapers, either the space one or the

115
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,220
spaceship one.

116
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,660
I don't know how easy those are.

117
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,020
Um, those are actually know that some of them I can make, I can make some of them.

118
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,500
I think the star one is a Celeste pattern.

119
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,680
I think it is.

120
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,640
I have all of the Celeste patterns, so cool.

121
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:50,600
So anyway, my wife's yelling to me, Oh, it's the wife placed in an order.

122
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Sorry.

123
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
It's so funny.

124
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,040
She wanted an omelet in the skillet.

125
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,280
Oh, all you need to do is make the skillet and customize it.

126
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,280
Oh yeah.

127
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
The mega skill and customize it.

128
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
Okay.

129
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,280
Yeah.

130
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,080
I have pizza in mine cause I have my pizza oven area.

131
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,860
Anyway, if you want to hear two hours of this, if you're an animal crossing fan, it

132
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,860
is in the archives.

133
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,860
Oh yeah.

134
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,860
We'll do it again.

135
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,860
It's in the archive.

136
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,620
And because this now we've shown all our islands.

137
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,080
Now we get to show other people's islands and that, so that'll be fun.

138
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:27,220
So anyway, to clarify act up, that's not my house that we showed off.

139
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,220
That was my wife's house.

140
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,620
My house is one single room and it has just a bunch of random garbage in there.

141
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,540
Cause I don't really play the game.

142
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:39,320
That was my wife's house with the interesting basement, which, which I don't think the kids

143
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,120
were supposed to see.

144
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,120
Anyway.

145
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,120
All right.

146
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,920
Uh, if you want to see that it is in the archives over at VOG network, uh, we're not going to

147
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,280
be putting it out as a podcast cause it just relies so heavily on video.

148
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,080
Um, so that is one of the getting, you could either watch it live when we did it, or if

149
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,080
you want to go back in the video archives, um, subscribers, uh, at VOG network over on

150
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,380
Twitch, get access to the complete video archive, which will, would include, um, the animal

151
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,260
crossing special and any future specials, uh, that we do as well.

152
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:12,900
And you can, uh, subscribe to VOG network using your free subscription that you get

153
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,100
with prime gaming, formerly known as Twitch prime.

154
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:21,180
You can use your free sub to subscribe right here at VOG network or, um, sub tempers coming

155
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,180
up.

156
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,580
And I think we have a story on it later in the show and it's going to make subscribing,

157
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,140
um, even, even cheaper if you want to do it that way.

158
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,140
We appreciate it.

159
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:32,200
You don't have to, uh, but that is how you can access the video archive, um, on Twitch

160
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,760
if you want to check that out.

161
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,760
All right.

162
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,460
So anyhow, let's get into some gaming news and, uh, kick off our show tonight with some

163
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,280
talk about gamescom because, uh, uh, that was a big event that happened this week, even

164
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,280
if it didn't happen in person.

165
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,280
Right.

166
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,280
Logie.

167
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,280
Yes.

168
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,820
So that was a pretty neat event.

169
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:54,840
They had like kind of their kickoff live stream with Jeff Keeley showing off a bunch of trailers

170
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,420
and talking about announcements and things.

171
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:01,700
So some of the stuff they showed off this year, a new trailer for the Jurassic world

172
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,700
evolution.

173
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:09,760
Now coming to the switch, um, there was a, I don't remember if there's much gameplay,

174
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,620
but there was a new trailer for call of duty, uh, black ops, cold war.

175
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,480
And that's going to be coming out in November 13th.

176
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,800
They showed the first game play of the upcoming expansion for doom eternal called the ancient

177
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,200
gods part one.

178
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:32,460
Um, they did a little tease for surgeon simulator two, which is out now, um, with, uh, doc Brown

179
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,420
in there for some reason, I'm not really sure.

180
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,540
Wait, wait, from like back to the future, doc Brown or back to the future.

181
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,540
Yes.

182
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:43,540
So I'm not really sure how that tied into it, but why not?

183
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,540
Why not?

184
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,260
But search and simulator is like a wacky game.

185
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,100
Like the title makes it sounds, Oh, flight simulator.

186
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,100
That's some serious business.

187
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,800
The search and simulator is wacky, even worse.

188
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Yeah.

189
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Going back to call of duty, is it just me or does it look like Robert Redford?

190
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
It does.

191
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,360
And I was looking, I seriously, I was like, is that Robert Redford?

192
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,080
Cause it it's down to the hair.

193
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
It's absolutely Robert Redford.

194
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,080
And I wouldn't be surprised if that's Robert Redford playing that part, but that's why

195
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,080
I kept seeing the trailer.

196
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,600
I was like, that is that Robert Redford?

197
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,080
I even like, I actually pulled up a picture of him to, to make sure I'm like, Oh, maybe

198
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,580
they use like hyper realistic license likenesses in those games.

199
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,020
That's the same game that all the Ronald Reagan stuff that's showing up on Twitter is from,

200
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,020
right?

201
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,020
Yeah.

202
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,020
Yeah.

203
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,020
And yeah.

204
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,960
And other celebrities in the past that may not have Greece, um, history also in those

205
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,960
games.

206
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,140
Um, but yeah, it definitely looks like Robert Redford.

207
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,020
I would not be surprised if it's Robert Redford, they didn't.

208
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,740
I would think that that was something that, um, if that was him, that they would kind

209
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,640
of call that out being like, you know, Hey, we've got Robert Redford in this.

210
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,400
Um, but cause, you know, gamers love Robert Redford.

211
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,960
I know if we, if we were to pull our chat and ask like top three celebrities, go heaven

212
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,480
spacey because that was a thing.

213
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,880
So yeah, but look at, look at what we had for death stranding, you know, going back

214
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:17,160
to our, our, uh, you know, seventies and eighties famous actors, you know, true.

215
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,180
And contemporary cause you know, obviously walking dead is huge.

216
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,180
Yeah.

217
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,180
But yeah.

218
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,180
Uh, search and see me later too, though.

219
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,180
It looks like a lot of fun.

220
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,260
It's co-op this time and there's a lot of like running around and doing things and severing

221
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,500
arms and stuff to like get to other rooms and things.

222
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,580
It looks really crazy.

223
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,140
So it, that'll be fun too.

224
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,680
That's not VR, but, um, soon probably at some point, uh, they showed some behind the scenes

225
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,140
of the new dragon age game, uh, is really just a bunch of like concept art.

226
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,780
So I have no idea what the heck this game is going to look like, but it's already out

227
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,760
Why don't you defer to Jamie?

228
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:57,080
There's a new salmon max VR game that they've, uh, were teasing.

229
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,480
So I'm all about that.

230
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,800
Um, as you can see by my background, um, they did a trailer for the new world of Warcraft

231
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,640
expansion shadow lands, which looks like world of Warcraft.

232
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,640
Yeah.

233
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,540
Not, uh, not really a fan of that series, so I'm sure it's important to somebody, um,

234
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,200
they talked a little bit about crash four with some of the gameplay elements for that.

235
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,600
They shut off a trailer for little nightmares two, which looks pretty darn creepy.

236
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,080
Um, showed a little bit more of the VR gameplay from star Wars squadrons.

237
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,020
Uh, they have a star Wars themed expansion for the Sims four.

238
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,020
That looks pretty cool.

239
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,080
Did you watch the trailer?

240
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,200
I missed the trailer for that one.

241
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,360
Unfortunately, it might be enough to get me back into Sims four.

242
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
It looked pretty cool.

243
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,500
Uh, they showed off a new trailer for mafia, the definitive edition, which looks pretty

244
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
cool.

245
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,460
I'd never played the original games, but I heard they're pretty good.

246
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:55,580
Um, Lego star Wars, the Skywalker saga, um, which looks pretty nice.

247
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,340
I have never really played the Lego star Wars games, but I played all the other ones, so

248
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,340
why not?

249
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:05,660
Uh, they show fall guy season two, kind of a sneak peek of what the new courses are.

250
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:11,140
Um, they have a little bit of a, a little bit of a, a little bit of a, a, a, a, a, a

251
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,840
season two kind of a sneak peek of what the new courses and, uh, themes are going to be.

252
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,120
It's all medieval themes.

253
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,480
So they have new costumes and courses based around that, uh, new VR medal of honor game

254
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,520
from respawn, a medal of honor above and beyond, which looks pretty cool.

255
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:31,720
Uh, um, destiny beyond light.

256
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,600
I mean, I'm surprised that does seem to still going, uh, well, it's, it's making that huge

257
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,020
shift to free to play.

258
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,100
Um, and there's other big shifts that are coming with the game.

259
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,940
I, well, I already own it.

260
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,700
I mean, so like the free to play doesn't really change things, but I am kind of curious to

261
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,740
check it out again.

262
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:52,080
I know the free to play transitions have been somewhat controversial, like the archiving

263
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,840
of the old contents, a little weird.

264
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,420
I am curious to check out the game again in its current state.

265
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,420
I do.

266
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:03,740
There's, you know, I don't play a lot of shooters, but I did enjoy destiny, you know, and what's,

267
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,980
what's interesting.

268
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,640
Do you guys remember, um, pre pandemic and it was probably January of 2019, um, here

269
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,560
at OLR studios, we had all the, um, the women of ingress, the mobile phone game I played,

270
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,560
maybe it was 2018.

271
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,560
It was a while ago.

272
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
We had, we had all those gals here in studio, right.

273
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,400
That I'll play ingress mobile.

274
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,400
Okay.

275
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,160
Like a ton of them now play destiny.

276
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,840
Well, they still play ingress, but they play destiny too.

277
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,560
And they've been trying to get me to play with them except they play destiny too on

278
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,960
X-Box and I'll have it on X-Box.

279
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,900
Well, can't you play cross-play though with like other systems, like the very least the

280
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,020
PC version?

281
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:43,920
I think there is that, but we have the game pass version coming out soon anyway.

282
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,660
So that's what I'm going to just wait for is when destiny two's on game pass and then

283
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,540
I can play with them and they can carry me cause they're probably all super high levels

284
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,560
and stuff.

285
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,820
So I just thought it was interesting that destiny two was the game they all got sucked

286
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,580
into in their spare time.

287
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,580
Yeah.

288
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,880
Some other neat trailers that they had, they showed off a new trailer for 12 minutes, which

289
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,160
was that kind of I don't even know how to describe it.

290
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:14,680
It's like a weird, like a drama type game where you're going to be attacked or something

291
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,400
by some intruders, but they've got a lot of, it's like a time loop game, but they've got

292
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,380
a really cool cast in it.

293
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:25,000
So Daisy Ridley, James McAvoy and William Defoe.

294
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,760
So awesome.

295
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,960
That looks cool.

296
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:36,100
And then they showed off some new trailers for Outriders, which looks interesting Spellbreak,

297
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:42,980
Age of Empires three, definitive edition, Godfall, which the more they show that I just

298
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:48,300
really don't care WWE battlegrounds.

299
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,980
Why would the big head mode, like, like you can do an arcade game, like NBA Jam or something

300
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,300
like that without everybody having giant heads.

301
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,300
It looks weird.

302
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:01,720
Um, so yeah, that was pretty much it.

303
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,680
So what did you think overall of it?

304
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,080
I don't know, it was nothing like huge and exciting.

305
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,120
There's like, I mean, there was some like interesting announcements, but it wasn't like

306
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,000
blowing my, you know, blowing me away.

307
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,160
It was just kind of like, oh yeah, you know, cool VR, Sam, Max, and the rest I could just

308
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,200
kind of do without, I mean, I don't know.

309
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,720
Um, I'm just like, whatever for VR.

310
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,340
I was a little excited to see some of the prelims for Dragon Age four, but that's really

311
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,780
about it for me.

312
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,780
It's very good.

313
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,780
Like underwhelming.

314
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,580
I think they didn't really have like some really huge announcements.

315
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:38,660
I'm assuming that a lot of the, um, whereas we would have gotten probably a lot more announcements

316
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:44,220
from the big three, um, during one of these types of events, but being that we're in like

317
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:49,920
pandemic mode here, that everybody who's been doing their own like digital events and they've

318
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,340
been announcing everything there.

319
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:56,040
So I think this is kind of like the leftover scraps, which is fine because there's a lot

320
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,120
of like other companies that can, you know, show off their games that might not necessarily,

321
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:08,600
you know, be highlighted in one of those, um, it was okay.

322
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,280
I guess I, they, I know they were streaming like for three days, like showing different

323
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,680
things, but I didn't catch any of the other footage.

324
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,980
So like, I couldn't tell you if there's any, I don't think there was any other announcements,

325
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,500
but I don't know.

326
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,500
It is what it is.

327
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,500
Um, yeah.

328
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,160
I mean, it was, it was a little, I, it was both kind of like a bad thing and a good thing

329
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,880
that like there was nothing like Sony or Microsoft, like kind of first party in those because

330
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,560
obviously they want to do their own things.

331
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,440
And both those companies are probably feeling the pressure of, they're going to have to

332
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,680
announce that date and price pretty darn soon here.

333
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,520
Or I don't already do them pre-orders I mean, or they're starting pre-orders in these systems

334
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,520
already.

335
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,260
So it's like, well, well, if you're talking about the Sony thing, cause that's like a,

336
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:58,460
it's a pre pre-order cause cause pre-orders aren't enough anymore.

337
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,460
Low key.

338
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,460
No, no, no, no, no.

339
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:05,700
In the year 2020 we have pre pre-orders, which you, which literally is you're entering a

340
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:10,580
raffle to get the opportunity to pre-order a PlayStation five.

341
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:15,080
You know, as, as much as I'm being a SAS master on this whole thing, I actually kind of get

342
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,340
it because I think what they're doing is really trying to go the extra mile to prevent scalper

343
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,340
burrs.

344
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,760
And from that viewpoint, I'm actually very appreciative.

345
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,960
So hype is what I'm thinking they're trying to do.

346
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,280
Like, I don't think it's scalpers necessarily.

347
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,360
It could be part that, but it, what, what it is having that effect that it's going to

348
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,280
be a lot harder for scalpers to get them.

349
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,520
And for that I'm thankful, um, bar none, but yeah, it's kind of like, where is the fricking

350
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,560
price and date?

351
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,640
Now we're starting to get into that whole, okay, we we've been giving them plenty of

352
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,200
time, but times like if these things are releasing in November.

353
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:56,140
Well, we got a bunch of people, the, so the rumor is, um, just making sure we don't have

354
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,740
said rumor in our story.

355
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,460
Uh, so the rumor is that they're going to start pre-orders on the PlayStation, uh, five

356
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:08,780
on September 9th, because it's the anniversary of the original PlayStation is the rumor.

357
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:14,820
So I guess we only have a, you know, a couple more weeks to see if that's true or not.

358
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,820
Yeah.

359
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,280
By the time OLR is back, uh, because we will be, we won't be here next week.

360
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,920
We'll talk a little more about that in a minute.

361
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,400
Um, but it'll be after September 9th.

362
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,120
So I got to see the price too, like, cause, cause you know, there's people, I mean, obviously

363
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,780
there's nothing really substantiated yet, but like, there's like talk that some of these

364
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:38,860
systems are going to be over a thousand dollars, like, nope, um, not happening.

365
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:43,600
She-Hulk 10 in chat, uh, says delayed 2021 COVID.

366
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,220
You know, you're certainly not the first to say that.

367
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,820
And I think there was a big Kotaku article that was written up on the subject about,

368
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,980
you know, what should, should they just wait till next year at this point?

369
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,060
And I know, and I should have just invited him back to sit with us again, uh, on the

370
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,060
show.

371
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:01,060
But, uh, my buddy Delvin, VGRealness had brought this up in one of our chats is that I just

372
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:04,060
like just fucking delay them to next year already.

373
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,340
Like this, this year is, is shit.

374
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:12,220
Just let it go down the drain and let's just try to focus on making next year bigger.

375
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,880
And that would include the consoles, just put them out next year at this point.

376
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,200
Um, and I, I have to kind of admit points were made.

377
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:28,640
Like, I, I don't know if I'm super into, like, I need to have these consoles this year.

378
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,040
When this year started, I definitely thought that, but just with everything that we've

379
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,760
all been through this year, I'm kind of at the point where I'm like, I kind of think

380
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,480
I'm only going to end up getting one or the other this year and I'm going to wait till

381
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,480
next year.

382
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,580
Which is fine too.

383
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:48,020
Who has the best launch games because, you know, that's really what it comes down to.

384
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:53,420
And now, you know, other rumors out there about other enhancements coming, um, you know,

385
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:57,060
maybe I get one of those so I can actually have a console to play on.

386
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,060
Yeah.

387
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,540
My family isn't monopolizing, but, um, yeah, I don't know.

388
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:08,740
I was, uh, both are kind of expensive like right now I think, but because I'm not taking

389
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,720
my family out every weekend, I can kind of afford to announce, I guess it'd be fine.

390
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,640
Let me, let me, let me ask an impromptu question of our chat room because we are the show where

391
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,680
every gamer has a voice.

392
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,620
I want to hear specifically your guys' voices on this.

393
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:27,880
What would be your reaction if next week it hits the media, Sony and Microsoft, both just

394
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:33,460
coincidentally back to back, same day, whatever they both announce, um, due to the pandemic,

395
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:38,320
due to, you know, whatever they say, we're going to push back these releases 2021.

396
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,280
We're going to push back the release of both these systems to let's say March, 2021.

397
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,920
They're going to try to still squeeze in the same fiscal year.

398
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,960
How would you feel?

399
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,360
Just kind of throwing that out there.

400
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,600
I'm really curious to hear how the chatters might feel.

401
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,700
Would you be relieved?

402
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,040
Cause it's like, Oh, I've got more time to, would you feel, would you feel a little sad

403
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,580
because you were really hoping like, Oh, I kind of need, I needed something to look forward

404
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,720
to during all this and now it's being delayed.

405
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,080
Like I'm really curious.

406
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,080
Um, okay.

407
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,440
So looking in chat, you guys are quick, uh, she Hulk says sad, but better to do it right

408
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,480
than fast and broken.

409
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,320
Insert that famous line about a good game is, or a bad game is bad forever and that

410
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,320
whole thing.

411
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,320
Right?

412
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,320
Uh, Bobby Blackwell says, I'd be fine.

413
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,320
As join her.

414
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,320
Matt says, I'd be fine.

415
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,760
Pixel pocket says, I wouldn't mind.

416
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,140
Did your MS says, doesn't bother me.

417
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,120
So I'm here, you know, that's only five people in chat, but still I'm hearing a resounding

418
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:38,080
kind of seems to be the verdict, you know, that's all I need is cyberpunk.

419
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,160
So it's all good.

420
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,600
But cyberpunk is going to be on the current Jen.

421
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,560
So it doesn't like that's also going to be on the other one and I'm getting on PC.

422
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,560
So, you know, it's fine.

423
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,560
I have that.

424
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,360
I have that regardless of, um, whatever they put out.

425
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,200
So the rest is gravy, I guess Bobby Blackwell says, don't you dare delay

426
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,520
a Nintendo direct one minute longer.

427
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:07,640
I'm glad someone went against the grain here fifth dream says, I'd be mad.

428
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,520
My job is tenuous right now.

429
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,720
Ironically, I will have it probably until COVID is over.

430
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,720
So I need them now.

431
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,960
So I can buy PlayStation five before my job poofs, LOL.

432
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:23,460
So maybe one of those, like it actually works out in my budget and everybody's financial

433
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,360
situation is different, but it works better for me to budget the money to get it now,

434
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,600
as opposed to budgeting the money to get it later, which isn't one you hear often.

435
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,400
But again, your financial situation, not mine, everybody's is different.

436
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,680
So anyway, thank you for indulging me there with the question there, because I'm just

437
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,320
kind of curious, I'm kind of curious if that would be, you know, our listener is one subset

438
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,320
of gamers.

439
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,420
I'm kind of curious what the general reaction on Twitter would be if that that and social

440
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,320
media, I mean, Twitter to represent all social media with the representation would be if

441
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,520
they announced that because I feel like there are a lot of people that would be like, oh,

442
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,520
this sucks.

443
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,440
But at the same time, I also kind of feel like that might be the easy comment to make.

444
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,440
But there would be a lot of people that would just be like, yeah, tell me something else.

445
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,440
Right.

446
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,760
Hell, we already if I did slip my mind while I was going over this, but we've already had

447
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,520
one console slip their launch into 2021 and television amico.

448
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:28,740
I realize that probably isn't on people's radar in the same way that PS5 and Xbox Series

449
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,640
X are, but some people are looking forward to that.

450
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,560
It's a different audience.

451
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,920
And that slipped to next year.

452
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,840
And I think, you know, I'm somebody that preordered an Intellivision and I was also one of the

453
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,860
people that went, eh, am I surprised?

454
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,860
Not really.

455
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,400
Sad, but understandable.

456
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,400
And that's that.

457
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
So.

458
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,400
All right.

459
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
Anyhow.

460
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,400
Um.

461
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,400
Let's see.

462
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,840
DJ Rama says not to sound like a downer, but let me be real with you, 2020 kind of broke

463
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,840
me mentally.

464
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,400
So if the next gen consoles were canceled, I'd be a bit upset about it only because I

465
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,320
understand why that bit would have been me really wanting it.

466
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,720
No, I totally get it.

467
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,280
I totally get it.

468
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:15,720
And I'm sorry to hear about that, but I mean, like the good news for this earth and I hope

469
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,400
this doesn't sound like I'm trying to lessen what you said because I'm absolutely not doing

470
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,400
that.

471
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:27,080
But a lot of us are feeling like what else is going to happen in 2020.

472
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,120
So vent, my friend, because you are in good company.

473
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,920
I guess that's kind of my point.

474
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,920
Anyhow.

475
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,680
Bobby Blackwell says the Commodore 64 releases in November.

476
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,920
The full sized version of that releases in November.

477
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,280
That's your new console for 2020.

478
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,360
And Pod Culture says, I wish Amazon would restock the TurboGrafx-16 mini.

479
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,960
I didn't realize that was running low.

480
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,600
I mean, that's just because I got one early, but.

481
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:59,120
So one funny thing, though, like I recently picked up a Nest Mini because Nintendo selling

482
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,320
the refurbished ones for less than what they were retailing for before.

483
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,240
So you don't have to buy them at scalper prices and they're in stock.

484
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,240
Hmm.

485
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,320
OK, that's good.

486
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,320
We don't like scalpers.

487
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,320
$49.99.

488
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,320
All right.

489
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,360
All right.

490
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,480
Well, I think that's all I'll say about Gamescom for now.

491
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,120
It was, you know, it's nice to get some updates and especially, you know, even if the big

492
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,420
players weren't there, there's a lot of other companies that make games work.

493
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,400
So it was cool to get some updates from them.

494
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,400
So.

495
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
All right.

496
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,720
Let's move on to our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing

497
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,720
this week.

498
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,640
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

499
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,000
A little bit uneventful.

500
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,360
I was playing Animal Crossing and wordscapes.

501
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,840
Wordscapes is I actually because I believe it or not, I beat the other word game that

502
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,840
I was playing.

503
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,240
All fifteen hundred levels of it.

504
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,920
So wordscapes is a little bit harder.

505
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,720
It's got a bigger dictionary to it, so I'm enjoying it a bit more.

506
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,240
I'm also playing words with friends.

507
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,560
I really have just been I have so much going on because I had a doctor's visit and I had

508
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,480
to get my eyes checked and I had so much going on this last week.

509
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,880
Also next week is my anniversary.

510
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,720
So Dan and I have been married for 15 years.

511
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:24,240
So we're probably going to, you know, just stay and play classic games all day and eat

512
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,240
sushi.

513
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,240
We'll see.

514
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,240
Well, congratulations on that landmark.

515
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,240
It's a big number.

516
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,240
Thank you.

517
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,240
We were supposed to be in New Orleans.

518
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,240
I know.

519
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,240
Oops.

520
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,240
But 2020.

521
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,240
Yeah.

522
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,240
Yeah, whatever.

523
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,240
Whoopty shit.

524
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,240
2020.

525
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,240
All right.

526
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,520
Well, that's it for your gaming week.

527
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,520
Let's talk to Loki.

528
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,520
How was your gaming week?

529
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,680
So my gaming week was pretty uneventful.

530
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:51,520
I played a few things, a little bit of Animal Crossing because of the live stream.

531
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:59,920
I played a little bit of Zelda Breath of the Wild because my son kept wanting me to help

532
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:04,200
him with different things.

533
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,800
And the rest was just kind of messing around with game dev stuff, not really getting very

534
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
far.

535
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
Yeah.

536
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,800
I saw that little screenshot on your Twitter.

537
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,800
What was that all about?

538
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,800
Yeah.

539
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,800
That was just without context.

540
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,800
Sorry.

541
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,800
Okay.

542
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,800
All right.

543
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
It's going to be like that.

544
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800
All right.

545
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
All right.

546
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,800
Let me talk about my gaming week.

547
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,800
So I've been playing a lot of the same old stuff.

548
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
Final Fantasy 14.

549
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,720
Y'all saw the Animal Crossing thing earlier this week.

550
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,960
I've also been playing Pokemon Go, but I'll talk a little more about that with one of

551
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,640
our news items coming up later.

552
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,360
And I played some other stuff too.

553
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:41,720
So speaking of Pokemon, I actually, since I still use the Poke Ball Plus and with Pokemon

554
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,360
Shield, Sword and Shield of course, but I have Shield.

555
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,160
So with Pokemon Shield, you can transfer a Pokemon into the ball, although you're not

556
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,240
really like, you're not losing it from your party or anything.

557
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,680
You put a Pokemon in your Poke Ball Plus and then you can go out and catch Pokemon with

558
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,560
it and you get rewards in the main game.

559
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,720
Well, I had put some Pokemon in there like a month ago and I'd been playing Pokemon Go

560
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,760
like Go Fest, Community Day, all this stuff.

561
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,880
And I finally synced my Pokemon back over to Pokemon Shield.

562
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,360
Apparently I had collected about 10,000 Pokemon in the time.

563
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:23,600
That's how long it had been since I had loaded the, whoops, loaded the file back over.

564
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,120
So when it gave me rewards, it gave me 97 rare candy.

565
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,560
If you don't know what a rare candy does, you instantly gain one level on your Pokemon.

566
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:39,660
So if you're catching Pokemon at level 60, you give it 39 candy and it's level 99.

567
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,200
You know, so it's like, that was a lot of rare candy.

568
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,080
I got 97 rare candies.

569
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,760
So anyway, long story short, I decided maybe I need to like pick up Pokemon Shield again

570
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,520
because I beat the game.

571
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,680
I beat it when it came out, which, you know, again, I'd never beaten a mainline Pokemon

572
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,680
game before.

573
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,760
But I didn't get through the post game because every Pokemon game has the, after you become

574
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,760
the champion and beat the Elite Four or whatever the game's equivalent is, now you have to

575
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,140
go catch the legendary from the box art.

576
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,400
And so that's what I did.

577
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:14,720
And earlier today, or maybe it was yet, no, it was earlier today, I beat the end game

578
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,600
component of Pokemon Shield and caught my Zamzata.

579
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,200
So hooray.

580
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,200
So I did that.

581
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,880
So now I'm ready maybe for the DLC, but I kind of need to flesh out my Pokedex still,

582
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
I think.

583
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,760
But that was fun to revisit Pokemon Shield because I hadn't played it in literally months.

584
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,720
It's still a great Pokemon game.

585
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,440
And then another new game, let's shift gears a little bit here because this is a big change.

586
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:42,080
So I picked this one up on a PlayStation sale and it was one of those games that I've heard

587
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,080
a lot about.

588
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,080
And I think from some of you guys in chat have actually been kind of nudging me towards

589
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,080
this game.

590
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,840
So I picked up a game on the recent PlayStation sale called Telling Lies is the name of the

591
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,840
game.

592
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:02,560
So Telling Lies is from the same creators and like creative minds behind Her Story,

593
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,280
which was out like three or four years ago.

594
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,040
And a lot of the game is based in full motion video.

595
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:17,400
In fact, I almost feel a little weird calling this a game at the end of the day.

596
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,400
It's a game.

597
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Don't get me wrong.

598
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:26,000
You know, because some people try to dismiss walking simulators, something like Dearest.

599
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Was that like a Dearest?

600
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,560
Was that the game that yeah.

601
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,160
Some people try to write that off.

602
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,440
What was it?

603
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,440
Something about the rapture.

604
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,440
Yeah.

605
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,440
Oh, everybody's gone to the rapture.

606
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,440
Yeah.

607
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,440
Yeah.

608
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,960
Some people try to write off those walking simulators as not games.

609
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,960
They're games.

610
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,480
Those are beautiful.

611
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:49,880
But I would say that Telling Lies was a little more adjacent to like the Bandersnatch episode

612
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:58,000
of Black Mirror on Netflix and that kind of game where it's not so much like push X as

613
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,840
fast as you can or solve this puzzle, but it's kind of like a different way of exploring

614
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,640
a story.

615
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,880
And I really enjoyed it.

616
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,240
I really enjoyed it.

617
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,920
But the biggest like.

618
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,360
So let me talk about the strings, because there's a lot of strings.

619
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,200
I want to if I want to get in the negative, I'm going to make it sound like, oh, my God,

620
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,200
I'm slamming on this game.

621
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,200
I'm really not.

622
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,280
The positives are the acting performances in this game are really good.

623
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:30,300
There's four main characters in the game.

624
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,760
There's one man and three women.

625
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,240
And one of the women looked really familiar to me.

626
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,240
I think she's Storm now in the X-Men series.

627
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:46,520
He's in this and the guy didn't look familiar to me at all, but he is really good in this

628
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,520
game.

629
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,860
And in fact, all the all the acting is is really top notch, because what's interesting,

630
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:55,760
this game probably could have been made in the 90s when full motion video games like

631
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,000
Night Trap were getting started.

632
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:05,200
But like the production value and the acting and a lot of those early games were not great.

633
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,440
Right.

634
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:13,320
But now in this like this is like you're watching a Netflix show, but you're also like participating

635
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,320
in.

636
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,320
So here's the mechanic.

637
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:20,720
Basically, you're playing like a character that is watching surveillance footage and

638
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,680
you're going through surveillance footage and the game starts so that the very first

639
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,360
thing you search for is the word love.

640
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,720
So you will get the first five video clips because search limits are maxed at five that

641
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:40,480
have the word love in them and you watch the clip and then maybe the character will

642
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,560
say something and you're like, I want to know more about that.

643
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,560
Maybe.

644
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,900
OK, so this character just mentioned somebody named Ava.

645
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,900
Who's Ava?

646
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,120
I'm going to search for Ava.

647
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:55,080
Now I'll get five conversations where Ava is mentioned first word chronologically.

648
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,080
And that is basically the game.

649
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:02,300
You're choosing a path based on what you want to hear more about.

650
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:08,040
And it gets very clever because there are lots of different things you could be exploring.

651
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,140
There are several storylines embedded in the game.

652
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:18,540
And it's actually just what it must have taken to write a game like this is really brilliant.

653
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:22,300
And so I absolutely think it's something worth your time.

654
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,600
Jamie, I think you'd like this.

655
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,460
I don't know why, but I just think like this is the type of thing I think maybe because

656
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:35,540
it is just so much like a narrative and so like story driven where you're not like, there's

657
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,820
not like a lot of pressure on you to do like, I just feel like it's something you might

658
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,820
really enjoy to.

659
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:44,420
So I'll be sure to check it out, just link me so I don't forget.

660
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,420
Yeah, no worries.

661
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:49,860
So I'm curious if any of you in chat have played it telling lies.

662
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:55,980
OK, so let me tell you the one negative I have, because it is something that is presented

663
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,540
on the PlayStation four.

664
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,360
This game is also out on PC.

665
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,820
It was out there first.

666
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:05,500
And those computing platforms, I believe it's on mobile phone, iOS, Android.

667
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,320
It was there last year as well.

668
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:12,460
It just came out for PS4, Switch, maybe Xbox, probably Xbox.

669
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,460
It just came out.

670
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,460
I think I'm going to be getting it on Steam.

671
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:19,040
Yeah, it just came out on all of that a couple like weeks ago.

672
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,460
So or no, it's actually a couple of months ago.

673
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:28,220
Anyway, my biggest problem was my game brain took over.

674
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:34,660
And my game brain said, there's a clock up here and this clock is advancing.

675
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,660
It's getting later.

676
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:39,900
I only have so much time to get through all this stuff.

677
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:46,780
So I was too tempted to fast forward clips and not really watch them and just scan for

678
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,120
the language in the clips.

679
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:54,660
And I think I robbed myself of an experience by doing that.

680
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:59,400
So I want to make, I'm going to tell you one kind of spoilery thing, but I'm telling you

681
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,400
this.

682
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,080
I'm going to intentionally say this because trust me, this is something you're going to

683
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,880
want to know.

684
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,720
You can't lose the game.

685
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,720
That's the spoiler.

686
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,380
You can't lose.

687
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:16,040
Now that you know that, you cannot make the same mistake I did and turn your game brain

688
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,980
off and enjoy the story for what it is.

689
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:22,420
And I think you'll have a better experience.

690
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:28,420
So that's my one criticism with as brilliant as this game is, I wish it almost hadn't been

691
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:33,820
presented like the game it was because it made me think I got to get through this faster.

692
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,780
It's going to be game over.

693
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,220
And that's totally not the case with this at all.

694
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,100
So, all right.

695
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:47,900
Let's see comments and chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

696
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:53,940
Hi, Stella, Chad starts in chat talking about walking Sims.

697
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,340
I don't think I've played a walking Sim that hasn't been fantastic.

698
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,340
No, true.

699
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,900
Like they're all really good.

700
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:05,460
Fifth dream says, is this the game with Angeles seraphian and I hope I said the right in it.

701
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,820
I admit I bought the game just for her.

702
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,820
I'm sorry.

703
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,120
I don't know who their names.

704
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,900
I don't know the actors and actresses names, but they are really good.

705
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,900
Chad is confirming.

706
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,900
Yes.

707
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,900
Fifth dream says yes.

708
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,660
It's a bit crazy, but it's a cool concept.

709
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,660
She hope says yes.

710
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,420
And I like it so far.

711
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,420
And Bobby black of confirming.

712
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,420
Yes.

713
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,420
It's on Xbox one.

714
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,940
So anyway, that was my experience with telling lies.

715
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,740
I really liked it.

716
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:37,500
I just, I think the story is so smart in this context that they had to think of all these

717
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,900
different ways that you could navigate it.

718
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,340
I just it's, it's really impressive anyway.

719
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,900
So I give a big thumbs up to telling lies.

720
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:49,300
I'm curious to see what else we get that might be like this.

721
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:54,900
Not that I want every game to copy this format, but I love the idea of, so, so I mentioned

722
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,320
like, okay, it's not like a game.

723
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,900
Like you might think most games are with like action elements and push X to not die and

724
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,900
things like that.

725
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:07,280
Like it isn't a game like that, but we've had these things lately, like the band or

726
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,000
snatch episode of, uh, uh, black mirror.

727
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
We've had this now.

728
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,940
And of course her story before that.

729
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:19,860
And we've had other things that are more like, it's almost like it's less of a game and more

730
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:28,460
of a interactive storytelling, a new medium to tell using gamification to tell store,

731
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,460
tell your story.

732
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,100
I'd say that's what it really is.

733
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,340
It's gamification to tell a story.

734
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,900
And I think it's really neat.

735
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:41,460
And I'm, I'm so curious to see what else comes of it because yeah, I loved telling lies.

736
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,940
So there you go.

737
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:47,340
Buzz Buster says technology is finally caught up with what CD-ROMs attempted to do in the

738
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,340
nineties.

739
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,340
Right?

740
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:52,740
Honestly, there's no reason this game could not have existed in the late nineties except

741
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:59,700
for, I think they say there's like, they shot hundreds of hours of footage for the game

742
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,680
and there's, I think at least 10 hours in it.

743
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,620
And that would be the one thing that would prevent it from existing in 1990 is storage

744
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,700
mediums.

745
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,520
You wouldn't let CD-ROMs could hold how much, how much video could a CD-ROM hold?

746
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,640
Like 34 minutes, something like that.

747
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,040
It wasn't a lot.

748
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,000
So that's, that's the one thing.

749
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,400
So, all right.

750
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,600
Anyhow, that's my gaming week.

751
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,600
Sorry.

752
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,400
I talked a lot about that game, but that happens sometimes.

753
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,600
All right.

754
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,920
Let's get into some other news.

755
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,780
Oh wait, before we do that, let me do some quick housekeeping actually.

756
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,320
So we will not be here live next week.

757
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,800
We will not be here live with Orange El Dorado next week because it is Labor Day.

758
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,660
Well, it's also, it's also Labor Day weekend.

759
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,620
We haven't done a show over Labor Day weekend for the past eight years.

760
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,620
Normally that's because I'm not here.

761
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,580
I'm at Dragon Con.

762
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,980
And that's only partially true this year.

763
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:52,580
Obviously with the pandemic, I'm not flying out to Atlanta to go to Dragon Con in person

764
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,820
because they're not having Dragon Con in person this year.

765
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,340
They're having it virtually.

766
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:59,300
So I'm going to be participating with the virtual Dragon Con event.

767
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:03,300
And I want to invite you guys to participate along because you can actually, you don't

768
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:07,260
have to have a ticket to do a lot of the Dragon Con stuff this year.

769
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:12,740
They actually are running three different feeds on, the official con is hosting feeds

770
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:18,280
on Vimeo or I think there's an app available on Roku if you use that.

771
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,900
And you can watch several different Dragon Con dedicated channels all weekend.

772
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,840
And that's pretty cool.

773
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,700
But also some of the different fan tracks.

774
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:31,300
So what makes Dragon Con unique is that it's like, it's almost like 20 different fan conventions

775
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,220
happening all at once.

776
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,440
And that's what makes it really cool.

777
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,620
So one of the tracks that I've participated with for years and years, back since it was

778
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:45,080
called the podcasting track, is the digital media track because now it's not just podcasting

779
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:49,680
but Twitch, YouTube, and all the other ways that people create content.

780
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,920
They're going to be streaming their panels all weekend long on Twitch.

781
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,040
It's going to be virtual panels.

782
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,500
So you'll want to check out DC Digital Media on Twitch.

783
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,940
Or we'll be hosting it here at VOG Network, of course.

784
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,340
So you can just come to the usual place and you'll see it there too.

785
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:10,860
I'm going to be participating in three different panels over the weekend.

786
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:15,960
Friday at 7 Pacific, 10 Eastern, I'm going to be on a panel about networking and building

787
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,040
a podcast network and why should you join a podcast network?

788
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,460
Or why might you not want to join a podcast network?

789
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,460
Because there's some cons as well.

790
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,080
So we're going to talk a little bit about that and some things I've learned from my

791
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,000
different experience of the three different networks I've been with over the years.

792
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,860
So we'll talk about that at 7 Pacific, 10 Eastern on Friday.

793
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,700
On September 5th, video didn't kill the radio star.

794
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:45,820
Bobby Black Wolf, myself, I believe we got Rochelle from formerly of Electric Sisterhood,

795
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,900
but now the show Black Compat is going to be joining us.

796
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:53,520
This is great because usually we don't get her at Dragon Con, but thanks to everything

797
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,260
being virtual, she's going to join us for this.

798
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,800
I'm really excited about that.

799
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,400
And I believe Bill Run, Jump, Stomp is going to be joining us for that panel as well.

800
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,060
And I hope I'm not forgetting anyone, Bobby, I think it's just the four of us, but I might

801
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,580
be leaving somebody out unintentionally.

802
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:12,860
But we are going to be talking about taking your podcast in an audio format and taking

803
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,860
it to video, which is something we all have experience doing.

804
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,460
So we're going to talk a little bit about that and very excited for that panel.

805
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:23,920
We did it last year and it was, we were kind of surprised at how many people showed up.

806
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,140
So it was really cool.

807
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:28,600
So we're going to do it again this year in a virtual format, so that's really exciting.

808
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,420
So stay tuned for that on September 5th.

809
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:38,760
And then September 6th at Sunday at 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern, I'm going to be

810
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,160
doing a panel called Educating and Entertaining Online.

811
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:50,280
And it's basically a panel of educators and talking about making that conversion to online

812
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,620
in this whole pandemic.

813
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:55,640
Teachers really went through it.

814
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:00,160
And a lot of us though, were able to use some of our knowledge we've gotten from broadcasting

815
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,160
to be able to kind of help that.

816
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,480
So we're going to talk a little bit about that.

817
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,440
It might be like, Rob, why are you on that panel?

818
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,420
Believe it or not, my day job, I'm not a high school teacher or an elementary school teacher.

819
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,720
Other people on the panel are.

820
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:16,200
I create training in a corporate environment is the short story of what I do that actually

821
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,380
pays my bills.

822
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:21,840
So I do have experience in teaching of a different sort in a corporate environment.

823
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,020
So I'll be lending that perspective to the panel.

824
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:27,420
So that is all on Sunday, 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern.

825
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,860
And that is all, of course, on Twitch.

826
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:32,800
So we will not be here with Orange Lounge Radio while Virtual Dragon Con is going on.

827
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,800
And it's just a long weekend.

828
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:39,440
And we imagine many of you are going to be doing things, although of course, don't forget,

829
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,560
there's a pandemic going on.

830
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,800
So if you are out doing things, wear the mask, social distance, y'all know the drill.

831
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,940
But I imagine there's still a lot of people that are going to go to a beach or go camping

832
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:53,780
or do some of the outdoorsy things that have become very popular this year in light of

833
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,780
the pandemic.

834
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,980
So have fun, but be safe, of course.

835
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,200
So all right.

836
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,700
That's it for my gaming week.

837
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:05,200
So let's move on and get into some gaming news for tonight.

838
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,940
So Loki, why don't you start us off?

839
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:08,940
All right.

840
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:15,180
So let's talk about more, more wrap ups of different digital events.

841
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:21,740
So Nintendo did another one of their directs with our direct mini, I should say, that was

842
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,920
covering our partners or their partner showcase.

843
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,880
So it's all the third party games.

844
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,900
So some of the stuff they showed off their Kingdom Hearts, Melody of Memory, which is

845
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:38,380
coming November 13th, they're going to have an eight player free for all local co-op mode,

846
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,320
which is kind of cool.

847
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:45,420
They showed off some new tracks and artists for Fuser, which is pretty exciting.

848
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,420
I can't wait to play that.

849
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:54,360
Taeko no Tatujin, Rhythmic Adventure 1 and Rhythmic Adventure 2 coming this winter as

850
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,280
a combo pack.

851
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:01,860
Apparently World of Tanks Blitz is coming to the Switch as well, or is on the Switch

852
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:04,040
now.

853
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:08,620
They have a collection of the saga, Final Fantasy Legend.

854
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:13,540
It's going to be bringing Game Boy classic versions of those.

855
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:17,260
I guess it's December, Just Dance 2021.

856
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:21,500
And this is the first version that is not going to be on the Wii.

857
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:26,920
So that was a long run, but that trend is over, unfortunately.

858
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,680
So now it's on the Switch.

859
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:35,660
That's coming out November 12th, Puyo Tetris II is going to be expanding with some new

860
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,380
modes in December 8th.

861
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:42,860
That's kind of a surprise.

862
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:48,260
I'm kind of surprised Puyo Tetris is, I'll go back through some of these when you finish

863
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,260
the recap.

864
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,260
Sorry.

865
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:55,300
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Editions coming, or already came out, I guess.

866
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,300
So that was earlier this week.

867
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:02,660
And then they talked a little bit about the Minecraft Dungeons Winter DLC, which is coming

868
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:03,660
next month.

869
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:11,700
Yeah, and it's more expansions for other games like Captain Tsubasa and Jump Force Luxe Edition.

870
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,700
Gotcha.

871
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:17,660
So focusing on a couple of those announcements, well, there was a lot of music game announcements.

872
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,660
Did you notice that?

873
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:23,860
Obviously as a longtime music game fan, I was like, wow, there's like all these music

874
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,380
games showing up.

875
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:31,220
The Kingdom Hearts, Melody of Memory, which essentially is Kingdom Hearts' theater rhythm.

876
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:34,220
I'm not sure how I feel about that game.

877
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:39,580
I want to get it because I love theater rhythm, but I'm worried it's going to be like, did

878
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:40,580
they tell us the price?

879
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,580
They didn't tell us the price, did they?

880
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:47,180
I'm worried it's going to be too much money and the music isn't going to be worth it.

881
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:50,700
I'm not sure the Kingdom Hearts franchise has music.

882
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:55,980
Yes, there are some songs, I know everybody's going to say, but what about Utada and that

883
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,980
stuff?

884
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:00,380
Yeah, there's some great songs, but I just don't know if there's a whole game's worth.

885
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:07,220
There were all the songs from the Under the Sea level from the Little Mermaid stuff.

886
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,620
We had to sing all the songs with it.

887
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:14,020
There were all, I mean, the soundtracks for them actually were really amazing.

888
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:18,020
I would anticipate that just about any of those levels that had special music for them

889
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:21,620
would have been incorporated quite a bit.

890
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:26,620
And Let It Go was in the trailer, so I'm sure there's a strong Disney present.

891
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:30,860
Yes, I wince too, but that indicates there is a strong Disney presence.

892
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,860
That's not necessarily what I'm referring to as well.

893
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:38,860
I mean, the music in the game itself is fairly memorable.

894
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:42,860
If Amazon is to be believed, it's $60.

895
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,860
See, that might be a bit high for me.

896
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:45,860
I might wait for a sale.

897
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:46,860
We'll see.

898
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:50,860
I'll wait and see what the reaction is when the game comes out.

899
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:53,860
But I am a little more excited about Fusor.

900
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,100
I did like Drop Mix, so that was cool to see.

901
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:00,100
And I thought the Taiko game looked really cute too.

902
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:03,100
And I think that game already exists in Japan, if I'm not mistaken.

903
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:08,100
So it's kind of cool that we're getting it packaged as a combo here, getting to check that out.

904
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,100
So that's cool.

905
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:13,100
And then of course Just Dance, you know, it's kind of a standard at this point.

906
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:18,100
But that was four music game updates in a Nintendo Direct, so that was pretty cool.

907
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:22,100
Then I was talking about Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 coming out of nowhere.

908
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:29,340
That really surprised me because I kind of thought that conversation with Tetris had shifted to Tetris Effect, obviously.

909
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:32,340
And then on the Nintendo side, Tetris 99.

910
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:37,340
And I kind of thought Puyo Puyo Tetris would be a one-off.

911
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,340
And that's not me saying anything negative.

912
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:40,340
I enjoyed it.

913
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:41,340
I thought it was fun.

914
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:44,340
I'm just surprised that they felt the need to do a sequel.

915
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:48,340
But maybe the first one sold much better than expected.

916
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,340
How many different systems was it on?

917
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,340
It was on quite a few.

918
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:52,580
It was.

919
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:53,580
It wasn't quite a few.

920
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:58,580
Now, of course, I kind of giggle when they talk about, oh, the story.

921
00:47:58,580 --> 00:47:59,580
There's an all-new story.

922
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,580
I'm like, what story?

923
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,580
They don't play those games for the story.

924
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,580
But okay.

925
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,580
But I think it's cool.

926
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,580
And Dark Soccer, you're a fan of that game, too.

927
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:11,580
So is the news of a sequel kind of surprised you, or are you pumped for that?

928
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:16,580
I'm vaguely indifferent about it right now.

929
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:20,820
Just because I'm actually kind of going back to playing a few different puzzle games as

930
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:24,820
much as I love Puyo Puyo, I did not really enjoy it combined with Tetris.

931
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:25,820
Fair enough.

932
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:29,820
If I'm going to play Puyo Puyo, it's going to be Puyo Puyo.

933
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:33,820
Bobby Blackwolf is confirming that this new game will be multi-platform as well.

934
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:34,820
So cool.

935
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:35,820
All right.

936
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:39,820
Well, let's move on and talk a little bit about some changes to Pokemon Go.

937
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:44,820
Pokemon Go, of course, is a game that I spent a little bit of my spare time playing.

938
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:45,820
And I know a lot of you do as well.

939
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:50,060
And Pokemon Go finally brought Mega Evolutions to the game this week.

940
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:54,060
I say finally, but I mean, when the game first launched, I would have never expected that

941
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,060
these would make their way into the game.

942
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,060
But they are here now.

943
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:02,060
They've launched Mega Evolutions of Venusaur, Charizard, there's two, X and Y, Blastoise,

944
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:03,060
and Beedrill.

945
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:06,060
There's a quest line in the game that will get you the energy to do Beedrill.

946
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:11,060
And then you can Mega Evolve the others by doing a lot of raids.

947
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:14,060
They introduced this currency called Mega Energy into the game.

948
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,300
And you get Mega Energy when you do raids.

949
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:22,300
But long story short, I don't think the raids are worth the bang for the buck.

950
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:27,300
You have to do like at least, like you have to be good and do four of these raids.

951
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:32,300
You're probably going to have to do more of like five or six Venusaur raids, just that,

952
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:38,300
to get enough energy to Mega Evolve Venusaur one time for four hours.

953
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:42,300
After that, the cost of it will go down to Mega Evolve it.

954
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:46,540
It's still kind of like one of those, what's the reason to do it besides a short little

955
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:50,540
boost in gym battles and to be a completionist in the Pokédex?

956
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:56,540
And I think the prospect four years into the game to catch a Venusaur, which is an evolution

957
00:49:56,540 --> 00:50:01,540
of one of the first Pokémon that was in the game, like six times from a raid.

958
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,540
I just don't see the incentive there.

959
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:07,540
So Niantic needs to rework this system.

960
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:13,780
Now the good news is a lot of people have expressed their concerns, to put it that way.

961
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,780
And Niantic has responded.

962
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:19,780
They responded on Reddit and they wrote a tweet that's basically like, we hear your

963
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:23,780
concerns about Mega Evolutions and we're looking into what we can do.

964
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:25,780
So that doesn't mean it's going to change tomorrow.

965
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:29,780
But it's nice to hear that they recognize there's an issue and they need to look at

966
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:30,780
it.

967
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:39,020
Me personally, I would fix it by not having Mega Energy be per species.

968
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,020
That is silly.

969
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:43,020
Just have it be out of one bank, Mega Energy.

970
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:46,020
And you should be able to get Mega Energy from other things as well.

971
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:51,020
You should be able to get Mega Energy from doing quests, Mega Energy from hatching eggs,

972
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:55,020
and doing other things besides just the raiding.

973
00:50:55,020 --> 00:51:00,020
I think even if it's just a little bit, I think it would make it a little more exciting.

974
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:03,260
And so that's, yeah, that's my concern with the Mega Raid.

975
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:08,260
ActDeftInChat says, Megas are here and most people are not liking it with good reason.

976
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:11,260
Yeah, four at the minimum, but most likely it'll be at least five.

977
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:14,260
My gripe with this is, what are Megas good for right now?

978
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:15,260
They're almost useless.

979
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:17,260
That's another good point.

980
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:20,260
You transform them for four hours.

981
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:25,260
I did do a Mega Raid where somebody brought, we were fighting a Venusaur, so somebody brought

982
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:28,260
a boosted or Mega Charizard into the fight.

983
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:34,500
And what happens is that the Charizard, just being there, boosts everybody's fire attacks.

984
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:39,500
So it makes it that you need less people to get it down or you get it down faster.

985
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,500
So that is the perk at the end of the day.

986
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:46,500
And I imagine for those that really like to solo raids, it'll probably make getting some

987
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:51,500
of those three stars a lot more solo-able if you use them.

988
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:57,740
Shane in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says, I cannot get into the way they've done

989
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:58,740
mega evolution.

990
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:03,740
I've kind of stopped playing the game because it just sits so wrong with me.

991
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:07,740
I don't know if I would write off the whole game because of it, because like, for example,

992
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:09,740
I don't care for the battle league.

993
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:11,740
I want nothing to do with it.

994
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:16,740
I don't like that there's rewards tied to it, but I just don't play it.

995
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,740
The one nice thing about Go is that there's a lot of other things you can do.

996
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,740
You can still go out and catch Pokemon.

997
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:23,740
You can look for shinies.

998
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:24,740
You can hatch eggs.

999
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,740
You can try to take gyms.

1000
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:27,740
You can explore new gyms.

1001
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:32,740
I still feel like there's a lot of other stuff to do in the game, but I think the weekly events

1002
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:36,740
that they were doing, like the Enigma week and the Unova week and some of that stuff,

1003
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:39,740
that stuff was way more exciting than mega evolutions have been.

1004
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:45,740
So hopefully Niantic takes a chance to re-examine this whole thing because I'm not super into it.

1005
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:48,740
But at least there's other stuff that makes it interesting.

1006
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,740
There is that.

1007
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,740
All right.

1008
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:52,740
Well, let's move on.

1009
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:56,740
We're going to go to our next story from DarkSakura, and you guys will have to excuse me.

1010
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,740
I'm going to step away for just a moment.

1011
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:01,740
So other stuff then.

1012
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:09,740
Well, this one, I'll admit, I've got some cautious hopefulness about this one.

1013
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:13,740
And honestly, I wouldn't have really given this a lot of attention if it wasn't for Shane,

1014
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:16,740
who is in our chat right now.

1015
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:22,740
And that's about another Kickstarter for and I'm going to mispronounce this IUDIN Chronicles.

1016
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:26,740
And actually, after watching the trailer, it actually sounds.

1017
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:27,740
Yeah, you didn't.

1018
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:28,740
Thank you.

1019
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:32,740
It actually sounds like it's going to be a pretty neat game here.

1020
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:38,740
I mean, to the point that I'm actually considering putting some money down on it myself.

1021
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:41,740
It's a JRPG.

1022
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:49,740
It's it actually hit its initial funding of fifty thousand dollars by for Rabbit and Bear Studios.

1023
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,740
They've added a bunch of stretch goals on it.

1024
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:59,740
And it's going to have basically a lot of characters, very like Suikoden.

1025
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:07,740
And it looks like the they've got involved in this is Murayama Yoshitaka.

1026
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:13,740
There are 2D characters combined with 3D environments, very similar to Octopath Traveler,

1027
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:23,740
but it is now number three in the biggest video game kickstarters in history.

1028
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:29,740
So the only two that have topped it by number two is Shenmue three.

1029
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:32,740
Number three was Bloodstained Ritual of the Night.

1030
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:41,740
And I have to say, I'm looking at it with with some hope, so I'm considering putting some down on it as well.

1031
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:46,740
Maybe I'm not going to go for all the crazy stretch goals, but who knows?

1032
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,740
I think that. Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1033
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:56,740
I just had an FYI in the chat by by Shane here saying, yeah, the closing stream was great and the guests were awesome.

1034
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:01,740
Plus Akira Yamaoka was there and you could never go wrong with him.

1035
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:08,740
Agreed, agreed. And who knows? I mean, maybe we'll we'll have some of his music in there, which definitely mean I would have to have this.

1036
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:15,740
So, yeah, I mean, four point five million over that amount in crowdfunding.

1037
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:20,740
That's pretty, pretty amazing. A lot of people are excited about it.

1038
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:26,740
So we'll see how it how it comes. I'm actually fairly, fairly hopeful.

1039
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,740
Yeah, it looks pretty good. I guess it ended yesterday.

1040
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:37,740
So did it. Well, but it looks it looks pretty cool, like definitely getting the.

1041
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:45,740
Yeah, I mean, the art style is pretty awesome, so I do see the comparison between this and Octopath Traveler,

1042
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:50,740
especially just like the traversal of like the town stuff looks very much like Octopath,

1043
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:55,740
although the battle system is completely different and a lot more cinematic.

1044
00:55:55,740 --> 00:56:02,740
I do like I do like the character designs. I mean, there's definitely some cosplay able people in there.

1045
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:11,740
So, yeah, I'm very interested to see what this looks like once it comes out, but I'm not going to be for a while.

1046
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:15,740
It's not supposed to go out until October twenty twenty two.

1047
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:22,740
So it is what it is. I will probably have forgotten about this game by the time it actually makes its way out.

1048
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:26,740
Don't worry. Shane will remind you. I'm sure he will.

1049
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:32,740
I'm back and I will be reminding you because I actually backed the project.

1050
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:38,740
So I just I did it at a very small level where I'm just getting the digital game, but I'm into it enough to want to play it.

1051
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:44,740
So there's a little bit more to they because of the funding,

1052
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:52,740
they will have localization for Korean, Brazilian, Portuguese and Russian languages.

1053
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:59,740
So nice. Hey, more people that get to play it then. Did you guys read any of the chat comments I was out?

1054
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:02,740
Well, yeah, most of them were Shane. OK, yeah.

1055
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:05,740
That's why I just want to make sure because, you know, he has something to say about it.

1056
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:12,740
So I just want to make sure they are read. But yeah, he follows it so closely that I know there's a lot of good updates to pretty much.

1057
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:17,740
It was because of him that I had this update. Yeah, I don't even read the emails that the campaign sends.

1058
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:22,740
I'm just like, oh, Shane will tell me about it when we play 14 tonight.

1059
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:26,740
So, yeah, he mentions in chat, though, he just posted this.

1060
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:30,740
So I know you didn't get to this one yet. The vampire vote didn't go his way.

1061
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:35,740
I wanted the David Bowie one and he lost by just a handful of votes. I kind of wanted the David Bowie one, too.

1062
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:40,740
So and I didn't vote. So I'm part of the problem. When you don't vote, you don't get what you want.

1063
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:45,740
Remember that? Yeah. So this is why we get vampires that don't look like David Bowie.

1064
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:50,740
Well, this is why we get a lot of problems. But anyway, yes, this this this being a non serious one.

1065
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:55,740
Yes. Shane is also pointing out there's a also a side game coming out for it.

1066
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:59,740
It's a farming style game that will come out before the main game comes out.

1067
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:03,740
That's kind of funny, too. I just thought it was something they were building into the main game.

1068
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:09,740
But it's kind of like how bloodstained Curse of the Moon had that whole like eight bit game that preceded it.

1069
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:16,740
They ended up getting the sequel. And then now we've got like a farming game instead of like an eight bit RPG or something.

1070
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:23,740
I thought that's kind of cool. It's pretty neat. Yeah. Anyway, I'm looking forward to playing the finished game in what, like three years?

1071
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:30,740
No, I think they're saying twenty twenty two. So it'll be a little while. All right. Meanwhile, Loki, what do you got for us?

1072
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:36,740
All right. So let's see. Let's talk a little bit about Halo.

1073
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:42,740
And so. As you may remember, the last time they showed off Halo Infinite,

1074
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:58,740
there was some people that didn't necessarily like the way it looked and thought that it might be not really fulfilling the promises that Microsoft had made about like a next gen Halo game.

1075
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:03,740
And so because of that, of course, Halo Infinite's been pushed back to twenty twenty one.

1076
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:15,740
And to help hopefully get Halo back on track, they've added some Halo veterans to the development of the game to be able to get that where it needs to be.

1077
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:27,740
So apparently one of the main writers of the early Halo games at Bungie was working on a different project that now has been brought to be a leader of the game as well.

1078
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:34,740
And that's Joseph Stanton. So hopefully with good writing, you know, that will help.

1079
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:44,740
But more of the visuals, I think, that we noticed. I mean, I don't know what the quality of the writing was in Halo Infinite, but I know the visuals are a little bit rough.

1080
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:50,740
We would know like we've only seen like a little bit of it. So that's another concern about the game.

1081
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:57,740
I again, I kind of think the conversation on visuals was overblown. I understand some of the concerns people have and so forth.

1082
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:04,740
I still thought it looked fine, but I get that there was pop in and, you know, the other things that other people have already pointed out.

1083
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:09,740
Not necessarily that it was just like it wasn't very detailed, but like I get it. Art styles are one thing and stuff.

1084
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:13,740
But as long as the game plays well, I guess it doesn't really matter.

1085
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:22,740
But right. I mean, I don't know, like sometimes especially like if they're planning to do like a battle royale type mode with this,

1086
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:29,740
they may have simplified the graphics a bit because you're going to have, you know, maybe 100 or so players on the field at one time.

1087
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:36,740
And so maybe that was the reasoning behind it. But sometimes you would think with campaign you would maybe up that a little bit.

1088
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:39,740
I don't know. That could be a possibility.

1089
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:47,740
They're only pushing it back to early 2021, right? They didn't push it all the way back to holiday 2021, right?

1090
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:52,740
So my mind is kind of like, what all can they really fix with only that much time?

1091
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:58,740
Yes, maybe some graphical fidelity and things like that. Trying to get a little more oomph out of it. Fine. Turning up the graphics on level three.

1092
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:10,740
Yeah. But the writing, if that that means the voiceovers, that means the animations that go with that. That's that's a concern.

1093
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:22,740
Well, here's the thing, too, like here. So like I know like Bungie or it's not even Bungie anymore, but like, you know, the folks behind the Halo series have made some pretty great games.

1094
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:33,740
But that being said, the folks behind Mass Effect made some pretty great games. And then Anthem comes out and it was kind of like, not great.

1095
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:40,740
And Andromeda had some serious issues, too. Yes. Yeah. So like all great companies can fall.

1096
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:51,740
And so I kind of am a little worried. And that's why we just this day and age, even like, you know, Square Enix and Eidos or whatever, putting out different games like, you know, the upcoming Avengers game.

1097
01:01:51,740 --> 01:02:00,740
Originally on paper, it sounds great. But then you see like the end product and it's like it just gets marred by like executive decisions and stuff.

1098
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:09,740
And so we just have to wait and see. We had to play it cautiously, especially if we're dropping, you know, allegedly almost a thousand dollars on these systems.

1099
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:14,740
We just have to play it cautiously of these games coming out. So I'm going to wait and see.

1100
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:22,740
Well, it's funny you should bring all that up. So on a similar note, moving to our next story, you brought up Square Enix in that.

1101
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:30,740
And of course, Square Enix just released this week a pretty highly anticipated remaster of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

1102
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:40,740
Well, it's not being very well received by critics. And if social media is any indication, fans are feeling some sort of way about it as well.

1103
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:46,740
And a lot of the problems just have to do with it sounds like some of the choices they made for online play.

1104
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:56,740
This game really kind of shits the bed when it comes to online play. Basically, that that you're unlocking things in other people's dungeon.

1105
01:02:56,740 --> 01:03:08,740
So whoever's dungeon you're doing, you're unlocking stuff in their dungeon. But yet, as I understand it, certain story flags may still get set off in your own story.

1106
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:18,740
So if you do a certain dungeon with a friend, you might set off something in your own story that basically ruins a major plot point in the game for you before you've even begun to really play the game.

1107
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:25,740
So it sounds like just the whole online situation is not good. And you have to use friend codes and all this stuff.

1108
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:37,740
Which is interesting because I was like, why are they still hooked on friend codes? And then I remembered, didn't they first try to reboot Crystal Chronicles on the Wii and it never happened?

1109
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:42,740
And now all this time later, we're getting it finally on the Switch.

1110
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:47,740
I thought they did like a Wii and DS version of Crystal Chronicles or was that the original Crystal Chronicles?

1111
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:50,740
The original was Game Boy Advance and GameCube.

1112
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:57,740
So no, they did. They did a maybe I'm thinking of Chocobo Mystery Dungeon or something like that.

1113
01:03:57,740 --> 01:04:02,740
They were supposed to do Crystal Chronicles on Wii and they never did.

1114
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:07,740
And so this thing has kind of been worked on ever since then. It sounds like it's not.

1115
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:13,740
It just sounds like for the amount of time we've been waiting for this, it didn't deliver.

1116
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:17,740
And that's very disappointing, to put it lightly. Now, again, I'm going off hearsay.

1117
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:28,740
So if you've been playing the game and you've been loving it and you want to say something nice about it, by all means, please speak up in our chat room or send us an email over at participate at orange lounge radio dot com.

1118
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:34,740
It's just all the reaction I've been seeing is that it's it's not doing very well.

1119
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:38,740
Or well, I don't know. I don't know about sales, but I mean, it's just not being received very well.

1120
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:42,740
The critic scores certainly are indicating that. That's for sure.

1121
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:49,740
Now, it should be said, though, on the plus side, it does have a pretty robust light edition demo.

1122
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:53,740
And that's pretty cool and something we didn't have really before. So there is that.

1123
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:57,740
So you want to you want to say yay to some things that worked right.

1124
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:03,740
So Shane in chat says, if you're going to give it a shot, do not play it on mobile.

1125
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:09,740
I tried that last night. Yeah, I remember hearing the controls were really difficult on mobile,

1126
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:17,740
which is almost always the case when a game that was built with a game pad in mind transitions to mobile.

1127
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:25,740
That transition is very often not great. Games that are designed for mobile do very well on mobile,

1128
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:30,740
but games that are not that are kind of shoehorned into mobile don't always go so smoothly.

1129
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:34,740
So anyway, maybe this one of those things I'll pick up when there's a sale.

1130
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:39,740
But I was I was I was really bummed out to hear, like, a lot of the crap this game's getting.

1131
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:48,740
It's that's a bummer. Anyway, Act Deft in chat says, confirms there wasn't a Crystal Chronicles for Wii nor later.

1132
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:52,740
Chocobo Mystery Dungeon was what you might have been thinking about on the Wii.

1133
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:58,740
I swear I could probably find it, too, because I have crap that goes all the way back to E3 2006.

1134
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:03,740
I almost feel like it was in one of the early teasers for the Wii in 2006 was Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

1135
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:09,740
And they just they didn't get around to it. So, you know, they did have a game, though.

1136
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:15,740
It was Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, the Crystal Bears. Mm hmm.

1137
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:20,740
I think you're right with that spin off game. Yeah.

1138
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:24,740
And Shane says there was one about a king on the Wii. Right. Yeah.

1139
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:29,740
I think it was that whole thing. So. All right. Anyway, let's move on.

1140
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:32,740
We have more stories to get to in our classic game of the week is just ahead.

1141
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:40,740
But first, Dark Sakura. Well, there has been, of course, a very.

1142
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:50,740
So what I'm thinking of charged air in regards to anything having to do with civil unrest.

1143
01:06:50,740 --> 01:07:00,740
And Ubisoft has actually promised to pull an image that was used in one of their Tom Clancy games that was accused of promoting.

1144
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:06,740
All right. Black Lives Matter conspiracy theories. They used the raised fist image.

1145
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:16,740
You know, the. Image in, I guess, people on the podcast and see it, but the raised fist image in their intro video for elite squad,

1146
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:23,740
which is sort of an all star action RPG on their mobile devices, kind of Fortnite style.

1147
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:29,740
It was developed by Alliant, which is a Paris based studio. They normally do horse breeding games.

1148
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:35,740
But the intro shows a civil unrest with a group called Umbra, quote,

1149
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:41,740
a faceless organization that wants to build a new world order that is a terrorist organization.

1150
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:47,740
And they were using that symbol as.

1151
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:54,740
As I guess their their symbol, which, of course, is completely tone deaf.

1152
01:07:54,740 --> 01:08:03,740
Number one and really is sending the wrong message for the use of that symbol for for gamers everywhere.

1153
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:08,740
It really is insensitive and it's very good that they took it down.

1154
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:17,740
And for the for those who are in chat, I will gladly post the image so that people can see what the one in question is.

1155
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:21,740
But yeah, it's it's it's ridiculously insensitive.

1156
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:26,740
And they need they need to if they haven't pulled it down already, it needs to be down now.

1157
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:36,740
So there was actually a comment and actually I think some of this is already linked on our discord over at Vogue Network dot com slash discord.

1158
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:39,740
You can join our discord server and chat with us throughout the week.

1159
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:46,740
And Dungeon Buster in Discord actually linked to a tweet that was written by Brendan Gibbons.

1160
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:50,740
And Brendan Gibbons is a game and narrative designer for hire.

1161
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:57,740
So I believe Brendan worked on this title and wrote this tweet that said, angry about the use of the black power fist here.

1162
01:08:57,740 --> 01:09:07,740
I worked on the character bios and was informed that Umbra is supposed to be a James Bond villain organization, not something that looks like.

1163
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:14,740
Yeah, not something that looks like what the Q conspiracy people think is happening. Irresponsibly bad optics.

1164
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:19,740
That tweet is very thank you for sharing that on our discord, Dungeon Buster, because that tweet is very interesting.

1165
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:26,740
When you hear one of the assumed writers again, I'm sorry, I don't have all the details on what this gentleman did for the game, what they contributed.

1166
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:35,740
But to hear that, like they thought they were doing one thing and what translated into the visuals wasn't a match.

1167
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:41,740
Like that's that's really crazy to hear, because when I looked at the video and I'm trying to look at the video,

1168
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:43,740
like that's kind of the first time I saw it was that tweet and everything.

1169
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:48,740
And I'm looking at the video and I'm going, this doesn't look like a James Bond organization at all.

1170
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:52,740
And when I looked at the video, I'm like, yeah, it this is bad optics.

1171
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:58,740
This does look a little too close to stuff that's going on in the real world.

1172
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:04,740
So it's yeah, it was yikes anyway.

1173
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:14,740
Let's see, Act F says a co-host and I were talking about this on GFM cast and he explained to me that the rioters shown in the game are controlled by a terrorist group.

1174
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:16,740
But yeah, it doesn't excuse them from doing that.

1175
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:22,740
You know, still, this is a trailer that promotes your game and think about what you know, what what are you really promoting in that?

1176
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:30,740
So, yikes. Anyway, I'm glad they're at least going to fix it, for what it's worth.

1177
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:33,740
All right, moving on, Loki.

1178
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:38,740
Yes. So let's talk a little bit about mods and console mods.

1179
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:42,740
So there are some pretty cool portable Wii mods this week.

1180
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:53,740
So one of those being from Jinger of Mods, who basically fit a Wii system into the size of like almost like our original Game Boy Color.

1181
01:10:54,740 --> 01:11:06,740
And so, yeah, it's pretty cool using basically they have to hack up the original Wii motherboard and cut off a bunch of the circuits from that.

1182
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:19,740
And then it's also using a 240P display and parts from the DS and also from a Switch controller and even a GameCube controller.

1183
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:24,740
So very convoluted, but it is pretty cool the results from that.

1184
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:30,740
However, though, if you're looking for to do this yourself and you want to spend the money to do that, you have a spare Wii and all the other stuff.

1185
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:39,740
You can actually go to there's a website store that bitbuilt.net and they have something called the G-Boy.

1186
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:48,740
G-Boy and it's a DIY portable kit, so it'll save you the time of having developed your own shell and everything for that.

1187
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:54,740
So it comes with the case, the display and some of the other charging circuitry as well.

1188
01:11:54,740 --> 01:12:02,740
You'll just need to supply the battery, micro SD card, D-pads and ABXY buttons, which are found on a DS.

1189
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:06,740
And of course, you know, the Wii console itself.

1190
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:08,740
But then they have the instructions on how to build it.

1191
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:12,740
And I actually watched one of the YouTubers, I watched my tech tips.

1192
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:16,740
They actually built one and it looks definitely advanced.

1193
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:23,740
There's lots of soldering, obviously, and you have to also be very careful with cutting that circuit board, the main motherboard of the Wii.

1194
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:30,740
But the results look pretty cool. Like if I had the time and skills, I would love to build one.

1195
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:38,740
Yeah, it looks pretty neat from what I was seeing, too, is that, yeah, it's a pretty slick looking thing, but definitely not something I would want to attempt on my own.

1196
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:43,740
Yeah, so but yeah, if you're interested, like I said, check out that Bitbuilt website.

1197
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:50,740
They've got a lot of stuff that you can, I think we even have other portable kits as well. So check it out.

1198
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:59,740
All right. Well, let's move on to talk about this old rumor is back, upgrades for the Nintendo Switch in 2021.

1199
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:07,740
So we've had this rumor circulating a couple of times now that Nintendo plans to do like a Switch Pro or some type of upgraded Switch model.

1200
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:10,740
So, you know, why are we talking about it again?

1201
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:22,740
Well, this time the rumor is coming from Bloomberg, which is more of an investor type of publication and not somebody's like game blog or social media or what have you.

1202
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:29,740
So that's why this one is gaining a little more traction around the Internet than the others, because it's coming from more the investor side of things.

1203
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:40,740
So Bloomberg did say in a recent report that the successor basically to the Nintendo Switch, the next Switch, we obviously don't have a name for it, is due in 2021.

1204
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:47,740
It is called a upgraded model of its Switch console. So it's not supposed to be something where like it'll be a whole new system.

1205
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:58,740
It's just some type of like Switch upgrade. Also saying that Nintendo has looked into including more computing power and 4K high definition graphics.

1206
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:11,740
That takes a lot of people by surprise to hear 4K graphics because Nintendo, Nintendo kind of tends to show up later to the graphics and all that stuff party.

1207
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:17,740
So to hear that Nintendo's thinking about 4K already seems to be a little bit surprising.

1208
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:24,740
Of course, we have no idea if this means, does that mean 4K portable or just 4K when it's docked?

1209
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:28,740
I would imagine docked.

1210
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:37,740
Yeah, I would imagine docked only as well, but we don't know. Like that's just, you know, our logical brains trying to tell us what we think is going to happen.

1211
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:41,740
But we don't know until Nintendo actually announces.

1212
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:48,740
There was a similar story as well in a Taiwan economic magazine, Taiwan Economic Daily News.

1213
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:51,740
So yeah, that's that's where they're at.

1214
01:14:51,740 --> 01:15:00,740
It was pointed out that the time between the 3DS and the 3DS or the new 3DS was a similar timeframe.

1215
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:04,740
So this getting an upgrade would not be completely surprising.

1216
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:07,740
And I think some of us are kind of expecting it anyway.

1217
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:11,740
I just hope it doesn't kind of like splinter the Switch's base too much.

1218
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:17,740
I think the biggest problem with the new 3DS is that I was never really convinced I needed one.

1219
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:22,740
Yeah, there wasn't really a good reason for it. There's a handful of games that needed it.

1220
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:24,740
Two or three games that needed it.

1221
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:31,740
And the Super Nintendo, which I remember I threw a fit about because I'm like, why can't the frickin...

1222
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:35,740
But anyway, that's old frickin' news at this point.

1223
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:41,740
But I'm very curious, like what is really going to justify this new Switch?

1224
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:44,740
And I hope it doesn't splinter things up too much.

1225
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:49,740
But if it's one of those things where it's like, OK, docked, it will do 4K on Mario.

1226
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:56,740
But if you have an old Switch, then it just kind of plays in 1080 instead or whatever, 720 even.

1227
01:15:56,740 --> 01:16:00,740
Like an old Switch, then I don't think that might be too big a deal, but we'll see.

1228
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:04,740
I mean, I have no idea what Nintendo has in store because, again, this is all a rumor.

1229
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:06,740
It's a little bit of a surprise there.

1230
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:12,740
Sjo and Hunter Matt says Bloomberg cited sources from within Nintendo that gave this info.

1231
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:18,740
I would imagine if Bloomberg is citing sources, they must be more reliable than your standard Reddit user post.

1232
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:19,740
Very good.

1233
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:22,740
ActDef says, I need a performance mode for the Switch.

1234
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:25,740
I want my Overwatch at 60 frames a second.

1235
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:29,740
That's a good call. That's something that perhaps a pro Switch could do.

1236
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:33,740
And of course, Overwatch 2 is something that's on the horizon eventually, right?

1237
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:35,740
Maybe in a similar timeframe. Who knows?

1238
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:45,740
Shane points out in chat or Chad Starzik says, the best things about the new 3DS were the nub stick and the head tracking for 3D.

1239
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:47,740
Yes, those were very impressive features.

1240
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:53,740
And when I finally did get around to buying one, when they put out that Metroid one that I really wanted, I liked those features too.

1241
01:16:53,740 --> 01:17:00,740
But I'm not even sure it was worth it if you already owned a 3DS to get just that.

1242
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:03,740
But they were, I mean, it was a nice upgrade. I'm not going to lie either.

1243
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:06,740
Tigerclaw in chat says, here's the thing.

1244
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:12,740
If you get this new Switch, you're going to have to re-buy all the games you purchased digitally.

1245
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:14,740
Really good call out from Tigerclaw.

1246
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:21,740
If there is not an easy way to transfer digital licenses, I might be very hesitant to buy one.

1247
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:23,740
Don't they have that already?

1248
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:35,740
I thought they had that already. I thought they brought that into play when they had, they just put out the Switch Lite or whatever, the Switch.

1249
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:39,740
Yes, you're right. The Switch Lite. Jamie?

1250
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:40,740
Switch Lite.

1251
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:43,740
Well, aren't your purchases also tied to your Nintendo account?

1252
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:53,740
They are. And I was going to point out that we need to remember with the 3DS, since we brought that up, the 3DS, the new 3DS.

1253
01:17:53,740 --> 01:18:01,740
I remember transferring my ambassador license. You remember that? For the really early 3DS adopters?

1254
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:10,740
I transferred that twice because I moved it from my original 3DS to my Zelda 3DS. I moved it from my Zelda 3DS to my Microsoft one.

1255
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:12,740
So you were able to move digital things.

1256
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:13,740
I had a Microsoft one.

1257
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:16,740
I'm sorry, Metroid one. What is wrong with my brain today?

1258
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:24,740
So, I actually know I had a migraine most of the day, but anyway. So, moving it to the Metroid one.

1259
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:30,740
So, you were able to move those digital licenses. You could do it between Wii and Wii U as well.

1260
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:36,740
Yeah, but your licenses should follow your, my Nintendo account.

1261
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:38,740
No, they absolutely should.

1262
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:41,740
And I think that's what they do for the Switch.

1263
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:51,740
Yeah. And DJ Roma S says, ambassadors account. Yeah, that's because, do you remember when the 3DS first came out?

1264
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:57,740
I don't remember what the problem was. If it wasn't selling well, I don't think they had a lot of great software.

1265
01:18:57,740 --> 01:19:03,740
But anyway, they ended up doing this thing where they were like, if you buy a 3DS, you're going to be an ambassador.

1266
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:11,740
And you get like, it was like 10 Game Boy Advance games for Virtual Console and like 10 Game Boys.

1267
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:17,740
So, you got all these like classic from the Nintendo library games that only the ambassadors ever got.

1268
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:20,740
Like, there was a WarioWare in there, I think.

1269
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:30,740
Well, here's what's confusing me about what you're saying is that you're having a new system shouldn't matter about your, the games that you own.

1270
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:39,740
The system, the licenses shouldn't be tied to the system, they're tied to your ID so you can have another ID with the game, another system with your ID on it.

1271
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:48,740
You're right, it shouldn't. But I do know when I did those other processes, it wasn't as simple as connecting to the store and redownloading everything with my login.

1272
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:53,740
It didn't work that way. You actually had to copy everything from the old system.

1273
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:57,740
And it would move everything off of the old system completely and on the new system.

1274
01:19:57,740 --> 01:20:07,740
And I think it's one of those things about Nintendo that really ticks people off about the way they do some of the online stuff is that like the license is kind of like your ID, and your console.

1275
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:17,740
So, I got very silly. Yeah, so I agree and I think it's one of the things that Nintendo ought to address if they are going to convince people to upgrade to a Switch Pro.

1276
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:20,740
So, yeah.

1277
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:27,740
I mean, at least they have certain things like cloud saving for Animal Crossing and whatnot that you can at least keep your games going over.

1278
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:31,740
Now, they do, but that wasn't even there when it was first.

1279
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:35,740
So they already said that was going to be available, they just had to incorporate it into the game.

1280
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:38,740
Yeah. No, true, true.

1281
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:50,740
All right. Well, let's travel back to a more classic time. Let's go back to an era before there was cloud saves and before we had all these different pro consoles and so forth.

1282
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:53,740
It's the classic game of the week.

1283
01:20:53,740 --> 01:21:01,740
And every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault to find a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be checking this game out.

1284
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:09,740
And wow, Jamie, yet again, we have a pick here where I'm like, we're on episode 834 of this program.

1285
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:15,740
You've been doing this segment since episode 250 because there were some prior things.

1286
01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:20,740
There used to be like website of the week where there's some other things before we kind of landed on this, which is a great fit.

1287
01:21:20,740 --> 01:21:31,740
And I'm stunned sometimes at some of the games that I see, like you'll send me your pick and I'm like, how have we not done that in like 600 episodes?

1288
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:32,740
How?

1289
01:21:32,740 --> 01:21:34,740
I have that thought myself.

1290
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:35,740
I know, I know. It's crazy.

1291
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:40,740
And tonight is definitely one of those nights where I'm like, how has this never been a classic game?

1292
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:45,740
But that's not a negative. It just means we cover so much good stuff here, right?

1293
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:46,740
Right.

1294
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:55,740
We have a ton that we've done, and I'm a little bit disappointed in myself for not having done this earlier, but better late than never.

1295
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:57,740
You've done some other games.

1296
01:21:57,740 --> 01:21:58,740
I've done others in the series.

1297
01:21:58,740 --> 01:22:01,740
Yes, you definitely have, but just never this one.

1298
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:02,740
And that just surprised me.

1299
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:04,740
But that's OK. We're going to fix that tonight, right?

1300
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:05,740
C'est la vie.

1301
01:22:05,740 --> 01:22:07,740
What is it?

1302
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:11,740
The game of the week is Street Fighter II The World Warrior.

1303
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:15,740
Of course, many of us have just known it as Street Fighter II.

1304
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:18,740
It is a fighting game developed by Capcom.

1305
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:23,740
It was originally released in arcades in 1991, and it is the second in the series.

1306
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:30,740
The very first being Street Fighter that came out in 1987 that was not as happy about it.

1307
01:22:30,740 --> 01:22:38,740
It was the 14th title to use the CP system arcade board, and it improved so much over the first game,

1308
01:22:38,740 --> 01:22:48,740
including the special command moves, six button configuration and adding better, more interesting characters with their own fighting style and a combo system.

1309
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:53,740
So this actually became the best selling title of it.

1310
01:22:53,740 --> 01:23:07,740
I mean, probably since the golden age, 1994, the game had been played by over 25 million people in the US alone at home and in arcades.

1311
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:11,740
There have been updated versions since then, different variants on it.

1312
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:20,740
Because remember, before we had that Valve couldn't count to three, before it was Capcom couldn't count to three.

1313
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:28,740
So going into the game, basically you have your different fighters.

1314
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:35,740
We had, you know, just a few coming over from the original Street Fighter.

1315
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:48,740
And so your goal is to deplete the vitality bar of the other player by getting hits on them until they have no vitality left.

1316
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:59,740
If you do it at the same time, or you have an equal amount of life at the end of the match, then you get a double KO or a draw.

1317
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:03,740
You can get, you know, additional rounds if you have tied too many times.

1318
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:16,740
So, you know, so at any rate, if you could actually make a match last up to 10 rounds, if there was no clear winner, but when Champion Edition came out, it was reduced to four.

1319
01:24:16,740 --> 01:24:29,740
And if there's no clear winner by the end of the final round, then the computer opponent, if you're playing versus the computer, will win by default, or both will lose in the two-player match.

1320
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:35,740
So after every third match in single-player mode, you will have a bonus stage.

1321
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:37,740
Oh my car!

1322
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:41,740
Which was originally, oh my god, but they changed it, of course, in the US.

1323
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:56,740
The bonus round will have, in order, a car-breaking event that's very similar to the bonus rounds in Final Fight, the barrel-breaking bonus game, which I kind of hated, and then the drum-breaking bonus game, which I hated even more.

1324
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:58,740
I like beating up the car.

1325
01:24:58,740 --> 01:25:08,740
Between the matches, you have a Pacific-centered world map that shows you where each of the home stages are, so you are traveling the world.

1326
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:14,740
You have an eight-directional joystick and six attack buttons.

1327
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:36,740
I don't really need to go into explanation on actually how it plays, but to go through the original characters, you had Mew, you had Ken, you had Edmund Honda, you had Guile, or people who couldn't pronounce Guile called him Wheely, which was stupid, and those people made me cry.

1328
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:40,740
Yeah, I hate, I'm like, can you not read?

1329
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:48,740
Anyway, there was Chun-Li, there was Blanca, Zangief, and Dalsim.

1330
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:55,740
And you had your CPU-exclusive characters, and I will be going by the Japanese names.

1331
01:25:55,740 --> 01:26:02,740
You had Balrog, who in the US was Vega, a Spanish bullfighter.

1332
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:09,740
You had M. Bison after Mike Tyson, who was called, they switched him to Balrog in the US.

1333
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:20,740
You had Sagat, who is the Muay Thai fighter, and then Vega in Japan was called M. Bison here, which, meh.

1334
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:33,740
And so, of course, there was all kinds of just craziness that came out of this, different rumors and things, things that even made it into magazines as April Fool's jokes.

1335
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:35,740
I actually still have an issue with EGM somewhere.

1336
01:26:35,740 --> 01:26:45,740
One of Ryu's quotes was, you must defeat Shenlong to stand a chance, which was supposed to be translated, you can't win if you can't beat my Dragon Punch.

1337
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:58,740
But they thought there was a character named Shenlong in the game, and this led to a big hoax, and EGM played on it, and then there are two characters at the intro who were named Scott Max.

1338
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:07,740
So, at any rate, you know, they've gone and the game really spawned stories and all kinds of crazy stuff.

1339
01:27:07,740 --> 01:27:17,740
But the fun thing about this combo system, because this was one of the earliest games to actually have a combo system, and so many people worked on it,

1340
01:27:17,740 --> 01:27:28,740
and the original developers didn't really prioritize the balance of the game, and they really put more of its properties and how animated it was,

1341
01:27:28,740 --> 01:27:42,740
and how they could make it look, and how the characters would be able to, the characters actually took up different size, like Ryu was an 8 megabit and Zangief was 12 megabit, and the game took two years to develop.

1342
01:27:42,740 --> 01:27:54,740
But about the car stage, and this is a quote from Hunamizu Noritaka, who said that they saw the punch timing and it was possible to add a second hit and so on,

1343
01:27:54,740 --> 01:27:59,740
so they made, from a little bug maybe, they added in that combo system.

1344
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:10,740
And of course, most of the music was composed by Shinomura Yoko, and she actually left Capcom for Square two years later.

1345
01:28:10,740 --> 01:28:19,740
But I mean, of course, we know she's done a lot of great work for Capcom in the past.

1346
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:32,740
I mean, just different things that she's worked on, you know, Final Fight, Gargoyle's Quest, you know, she's worked on popin' music, probably.

1347
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:33,740
Oh wow.

1348
01:28:33,740 --> 01:28:40,740
Yeah, you know, but we've also had her for Nemo, just all kinds of games, she's done some really great stuff.

1349
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:48,740
And as I recall, she did, I think, my favorite music in Kingdom Hearts.

1350
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:52,740
I believe that she did the Tron music.

1351
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:54,740
She actually did a lot of music in Kingdom Hearts.

1352
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:55,740
Oh wow.

1353
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:56,740
Kingdom Hearts 2, sorry.

1354
01:28:56,740 --> 01:29:07,740
So as far as different ports out of this game, and I'm not talking about, like, the various special editions and whatnot, championship edition, you name it.

1355
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:18,740
There was the Super Famicom version that was re-released for Wii and Wii U Virtual Console, that was in 1992.

1356
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:32,740
Also in 1992, we had Amiga, Atari ST, those came on floppy disk, Commodore 64 Rob on cassette or floppy disk, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, PC-DOS on three disks, ooh.

1357
01:29:33,740 --> 01:29:46,740
In 1994, there was the CPS Changer, there was 1995 on Game Boy, 1997 Sega Master System, 98 Sega Saturn and PlayStation, with the Saturn version being greater, because it had 2D better.

1358
01:29:46,740 --> 01:30:01,740
2004, it came out on mobile, 2005, PlayStation 2, Xbox, PSP, 28, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Windows, as part of the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection.

1359
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:06,740
The Super Nintendo One had some big changes made to it with its release.

1360
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:23,740
They removed the attract sequence, some of the voice samples had to be reduced, you could not necessarily get a lot out of the character vocalizations, but depending on their strength level, they went higher in pitch.

1361
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:25,740
I don't know if you ever knew that.

1362
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:41,740
The tunes in the soundtrack were also rearranged, and there were just some different attacks that were removed, like Chun-Li's standing medium punch.

1363
01:30:42,740 --> 01:30:48,740
Two of the elephants from the Balsim stage, so yeah, it was really downscaled quite a bit, but it was still a really good game.

1364
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:55,740
And this, you know, the arcade version of this game got some amazing ratings from it.

1365
01:30:55,740 --> 01:31:04,740
It was, you know, it was probably one of the higher ranked games that released at this time.

1366
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:09,740
Of course, we're popular worldwide, and now we're up to like freaking Street Fighter V.

1367
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:31,740
But for our different versions of Street Fighter II that were released, we had Street Fighter II The World Warrior, we had Special Champion Edition, Street Fighter II Turbo, Street Fighter II The New Challengers, and then there was Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix, Ultra Street Fighter II, we've just had so many.

1368
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:36,740
And like I said, the joke was, can a Capcom count to three? Oh, no.

1369
01:31:36,740 --> 01:31:41,740
But I mean, it also has had such a big impact on just pop culture in general.

1370
01:31:41,740 --> 01:31:53,740
The game has been sampled so many times for its music, even Nicki Minaj sampled, or actually referenced the game, will be a bunch of different folks.

1371
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:58,740
Yeah, Nicki Minaj's single was called Chun-Li, so that was a good song.

1372
01:31:58,740 --> 01:32:11,740
You know, but who sampled list 80 songs that have sampled Street Fighter II, including Kanye, Jay-Z, Drake, all kinds of folks.

1373
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:17,740
And then there's also a British Grindel band called Hadoken.

1374
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:26,740
And I mean, it's just like I'm even just looking at the references page for all this, and it's almost as long as the article itself.

1375
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:39,740
It was such a huge piece of pop culture. Like, you know, you and I are a similar age, and I just remember how much this game dominated, you know, the early high school slash like late junior high kind of years.

1376
01:32:39,740 --> 01:32:45,740
Like this was in every arcade. It was, you know, it was just like the game.

1377
01:32:45,740 --> 01:32:53,740
And, you know, when it came out for Super Nintendo, because it came out there first before Genesis, it was a huge deal.

1378
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:59,740
Like it was a huge deal when this came out on Super Nintendo. Everybody was looking forward to it.

1379
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:08,740
It sold, I'm sure, Cuckoo Bananas crazy. They ended up doing Super Street Fighter, Turbo Street Fighter, all in the Super Nintendo as well.

1380
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:11,740
So, so well done.

1381
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:24,740
Well, and the other the other things about it apart from other things that it spawned is there have been different, I would probably say different other expansions to it.

1382
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:33,740
And in fact, the Street Fighter 2 characters became part of the G.I. Joe A Real American Hero line in 1993 because Hasbro bought the rights to the characters.

1383
01:33:33,740 --> 01:33:43,740
There was an unofficial South Korean animation called Street Fighter that had the Street Fighter 2 and then there was a movie in Hong Kong called Future Cops.

1384
01:33:43,740 --> 01:33:51,740
That was another, you know, rename of that. There were other adaptions for film, there was Street Fighter 2 the animated movie.

1385
01:33:51,740 --> 01:34:01,740
There was the live action one with Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue and Raul Julia, which I happen to have seen four times in the theater because of reasons.

1386
01:34:01,740 --> 01:34:15,740
And then there was also the US Street Fighter cartoon, which was terrible. Street Fighter 2V, the prequel series that was sort of, I guess, not quite Street Fighter Alpha.

1387
01:34:15,740 --> 01:34:26,740
There was actually there was for for Street Fighter 4, there was even an animation that came out with that game.

1388
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:33,740
And then, of course, who can forget the Street Fighter sequence in City Cop? Was it City Cop? Yeah.

1389
01:34:33,740 --> 01:34:37,740
Am I right? The Jackie Chan movie?

1390
01:34:37,740 --> 01:34:38,740
City Hunter.

1391
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:44,740
City Hunter, because I was thinking of the anime and for the life of me, I could not remember the name of it because I've watched a bunch of City Hunter.

1392
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:52,740
Yes, the anime was awesome. And then, of course, the live action movie is also awesome. And that Street Fighter sequence is really great.

1393
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:59,740
That sequence is like the memorable thing. And seeing, you know, Jackie Chan as Chun-Li was absolutely hilarious.

1394
01:34:59,740 --> 01:35:09,740
But yeah, you know, this this game has been embedded into our pop culture. Even if you're not a gamer, you know what the hell Street Fighter 2 is.

1395
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:23,740
So, I mean, and thankfully it's not the old whack-a-mole, they opted not to use the whack-a-mole style, you know, game that the original Street Fighter was for a bit. So there you go.

1396
01:35:25,740 --> 01:35:32,740
Let me ask you this crazy question. You know, this obviously was a game that came after, you know, it's Street Fighter 2 for a reason.

1397
01:35:32,740 --> 01:35:37,740
There was a Street Fighter 1 that I don't think was quite ingrained into popular culture.

1398
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:44,740
And what's interesting is that Street Fighter 2 barely references the original Street Fighter. Like you said early on, most of the characters aren't here.

1399
01:35:44,740 --> 01:35:47,740
You know, characters like Birdie and stuff, they're never...

1400
01:35:47,740 --> 01:35:49,740
But they came back for Street Fighter Alpha.

1401
01:35:49,740 --> 01:35:51,740
What's that? Oh yeah, they came later.

1402
01:35:51,740 --> 01:36:04,740
Yeah, like Gen and all of those. But they were really expanded upon. You know, I think that they had to step away from how the initial game went.

1403
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:12,740
And like I said, that whack-a-mole thing was stupid, okay? I mean, I get the concept behind it, it's novel, but that's no way to play a game.

1404
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:20,740
And it's gonna, you know, basically mean that arcade owners are gonna have to replace their machines or their buttons and keep doing all kinds of other maintenance on it.

1405
01:36:20,740 --> 01:36:30,740
But in the long run though, when going to a full joystick and button style, that's better for arcade operators, especially since it's using a particular system.

1406
01:36:30,740 --> 01:36:39,740
You know, and then even with the later ones going into the CPS2 system, you have your ROM cartridges that you can replace and keep using that same system for multiple games.

1407
01:36:39,740 --> 01:36:43,740
So it really was an innovation just in terms of gaming itself.

1408
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:53,740
Yeah, and I think also just like, I think what it brought to the arcades, the player versus player element, that I think a lot of games...

1409
01:36:53,740 --> 01:36:59,740
I mean, certainly that existed in other games, but like that was the core of this game.

1410
01:36:59,740 --> 01:37:11,740
And I think there was something about that that really lended itself to the popularity of this game and really paved the way for so many games that either tried to copy it or just were inspired by it.

1411
01:37:11,740 --> 01:37:15,740
I would say Mortal Kombat being the most obvious example. Obviously, Mortal Kombat is its own thing.

1412
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:19,740
I'm not saying that it's trying to bite off of Street Fighter, but it wouldn't exist if it weren't for Street Fighter.

1413
01:37:21,740 --> 01:37:22,740
Exactly.

1414
01:37:22,740 --> 01:37:28,740
Yeah, so, all right. Well, there it is, your classic game of the week. It's one of those, it's about time type of selections.

1415
01:37:28,740 --> 01:37:34,740
But you know what? No, I mean, like I said earlier, we just sometimes we're highlighting so many other games.

1416
01:37:34,740 --> 01:37:41,740
So many games have been made over the years. We finally got around to Street Fighter 2 tonight. Great pick. Appreciate that.

1417
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:45,740
All right, let's move on. We've got some more news to get into.

1418
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:51,740
And then we're going to take some comments from our chat room as we get to the listener roundtable a little later in the show.

1419
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:56,740
But let's get to some rapid fire news and talk about some other things that are going on in the industry right now.

1420
01:37:57,740 --> 01:38:04,740
Yeah, so let's talk about some of the games that are going to be coming to PlayStation Plus next month, or I should even say in a couple days.

1421
01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:12,740
So, speaking of Street Fighter, we're going to be getting Street Fighter 5, which is going to be arriving tomorrow on September 1st.

1422
01:38:12,740 --> 01:38:19,740
And also PUBG is going to be the other free game as well. So, pretty cool.

1423
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:28,740
And then also there is some updates regarding Marvel Avengers, and I can't say that they're good updates.

1424
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:33,740
It's talking about their battle pass system and cosmetics and all that stuff.

1425
01:38:33,740 --> 01:38:44,740
So, like a lot of the popular games nowadays, they're doing this kind of like season pass type of, well, not necessarily season pass.

1426
01:38:44,740 --> 01:38:58,740
I guess sort of like the skill tree that you would see in like Fortnite or in Fall Guys, for example, where you have to unlock things in order to unlock each of the cosmetics in there.

1427
01:38:58,740 --> 01:39:07,740
Well, to be able to do that, you have to purchase a challenge, a hero challenge card, which is going to be 1000 credits or $10.

1428
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:11,740
And that's per hero that you want to unlock that stuff.

1429
01:39:11,740 --> 01:39:24,740
Now, they say that at the end of it, though, you do earn your 1000 credits back, but that's after you grind through everything in order to unlock all of that, which I'm guessing is probably going to be quite a slog.

1430
01:39:24,740 --> 01:39:36,740
Aside from that, they're going to also have, of course, the credit packs that they're selling, that they're going to be selling different items that are going to rotate on a weekly basis.

1431
01:39:36,740 --> 01:39:48,740
I don't know. I don't need when you have like a huge article in this, this is even coming from Square Enix discussing how the monetization is going to work.

1432
01:39:48,740 --> 01:39:53,740
We'll take your money here. We'll take your money there. We'll take your money anywhere we can get it.

1433
01:39:53,740 --> 01:39:59,740
We don't even know like how good this game is going to be. And it doesn't seem like a lot of people are very impressed with it so far.

1434
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:02,740
So why are we getting into the monetization?

1435
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:13,740
I mean, they did keep saying that it's optional and it's just cosmetic, but no, I'm not. This just turns me off of this game even more.

1436
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:21,740
But it's a concern. We should be getting more, you know, on the great features in the game and reasons why we're going to enjoy it.

1437
01:40:21,740 --> 01:40:25,740
I just it seems a little tacky to be talking about. Here's how we're going to take all your money.

1438
01:40:25,740 --> 01:40:30,740
Like, I understand, like, and I will say I'm glad they are talking about it up front.

1439
01:40:30,740 --> 01:40:36,740
I'm glad they're getting ahead of because, you know, if this was all kind of exposed when the game was released.

1440
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:39,740
For our benefit, they're doing it to try to save face.

1441
01:40:39,740 --> 01:40:45,740
Yes. Yes, exactly. Exactly. But I'm glad we're getting it now and not later, I guess, as a result.

1442
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:53,740
So, all right. Other rapid fire things. Spotify is trying to amp up their e-sports offerings.

1443
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:56,740
They're doing a partnership with Riot Games.

1444
01:40:56,740 --> 01:41:06,740
And so now Riot will be working with Spotify, I guess, exclusively when it comes to League of Legends, including a new League of Legends related podcast and e-sports.

1445
01:41:06,740 --> 01:41:10,740
So there's no launch date for when the podcast will kick off yet.

1446
01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:13,740
But it is something that they are working on for this year.

1447
01:41:13,740 --> 01:41:21,740
There's also going to be some type of official hub in Spotify that will have gaming music, podcasts and playlists, including the official League of Legends.

1448
01:41:21,740 --> 01:41:24,740
And this is League of Legends playlists. And, you know, I have to say that.

1449
01:41:24,740 --> 01:41:30,740
And by the way, this is nothing new for Spotify. They've been really trying to amp up the representation of podcasts on there.

1450
01:41:30,740 --> 01:41:34,740
You can subscribe to OLR there if you want, as well as many other great podcasts.

1451
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:42,740
But they are, you know, one of the big, big shows they just got recently. Michelle Obama just launched a podcast on Spotify.

1452
01:41:42,740 --> 01:41:46,740
And I don't endorse celebrity podcasts very often because I'm very much.

1453
01:41:46,740 --> 01:41:52,740
And even when I'm reading this, I'm like, I bet there's a lot of fan run League of Legends podcasts that are worth your time.

1454
01:41:52,740 --> 01:41:59,740
You don't have to do the official one. But I will say, if there's any celebrity podcast I'm going to endorse, the Michelle Obama one is really good.

1455
01:41:59,740 --> 01:42:05,740
I mean, she's just such a good speaker anyway. Everybody was talking about her speech, you know, at the DNC and so forth.

1456
01:42:05,740 --> 01:42:10,740
And she's just so, so well spoken that it lends itself. It's kind of like when she had a podcast.

1457
01:42:10,740 --> 01:42:14,740
It's one of those things where it's like, I'm surprised it took this long.

1458
01:42:14,740 --> 01:42:20,740
I mean, I'm surprised we had to wait this long for this. So that was that was a great land in Spotify's world.

1459
01:42:20,740 --> 01:42:26,740
The one other thing I will say, though, with this whole League of Legends talk and Spotify, though, I can't believe we had that whole article.

1460
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:35,740
And whole discussion and not a word about KDA, because I don't know if you all have heard that new KDA song, but it's fire.

1461
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:39,740
It's fire. It's so good. There's a new one. Yeah, the baddest. Check it out.

1462
01:42:39,740 --> 01:42:47,740
It's it's really good. And it's that same kind of like K-pop and American pop fusion that pop stars was.

1463
01:42:47,740 --> 01:42:52,740
And they are going to be doing an EP at some point this year. I think they've changed some of the singers.

1464
01:42:52,740 --> 01:42:57,740
I think some folks were maybe brought into pop stars thinking it was just going to be a one song thing.

1465
01:42:57,740 --> 01:43:03,740
So they've changed the lineup a little bit. But, you know, it's like the Pussycat Dolls, right?

1466
01:43:03,740 --> 01:43:07,740
Yeah. At the end of the day, it was Nicole Scherringer and whoever else was there.

1467
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:13,740
Right. Destiny's Child. It was. Does anyone remember when Destiny's Child was four people?

1468
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:16,740
Anyway, it was Beyonce and her friends. All right.

1469
01:43:16,740 --> 01:43:21,740
Moving on. Let's talk about everybody. All right.

1470
01:43:21,740 --> 01:43:24,740
One other rapid fire thing I want to talk about. Twitch.

1471
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:29,740
September is coming back. No talk about any restaurant chain partnering with this.

1472
01:43:29,740 --> 01:43:34,740
However, September is coming back. September 1st at 10 a.m. Eastern.

1473
01:43:34,740 --> 01:43:37,740
You're going to be able to get some savings on channel subscriptions.

1474
01:43:37,740 --> 01:43:40,740
Twenty percent off the first month of the new subscription.

1475
01:43:40,740 --> 01:43:43,740
Twenty five percent off a three month subscription.

1476
01:43:43,740 --> 01:43:51,740
Thirty percent off a six month subscription. So, you know, if you have some channels that you're wanting to support.

1477
01:43:51,740 --> 01:43:54,740
And you know, there's so many great content creators out there.

1478
01:43:54,740 --> 01:44:01,740
Like, I'd be dumb not to try to put a cheap plug for ourselves, but I'm sure there are many great content creators on Twitch that you're watching.

1479
01:44:01,740 --> 01:44:04,740
And September is going to be a great time to stock up on that.

1480
01:44:04,740 --> 01:44:10,740
If you want to do that, even though there will be a discount for you to sign up for these subs.

1481
01:44:10,740 --> 01:44:13,740
The streamer themselves will still get the same share of the pie.

1482
01:44:13,740 --> 01:44:16,740
So Twitch is absorbing that discount, which is a great thing.

1483
01:44:16,740 --> 01:44:21,740
They aren't trying to force their discount on the streamer like their Grubhub.

1484
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:24,740
OK. Or one of those services. Anyway.

1485
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:32,740
So, yes, that's pretty cool. So you can bet we're going to try to push subs come September because it'll be a little cheaper.

1486
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:36,740
But please support all your favorite content creators. There's many great ones out there.

1487
01:44:36,740 --> 01:44:39,740
Including one that just showed up in our chat room, Black Compat.

1488
01:44:39,740 --> 01:44:46,740
I urge you to follow our pals formerly of Electric Sistahood on their new venture over there.

1489
01:44:46,740 --> 01:44:50,740
And I know there are many other folks as well that are streaming in this day and age.

1490
01:44:50,740 --> 01:44:55,740
DJ Rama S, I'm sure would love it if you would follow Anime Jam Session.

1491
01:44:55,740 --> 01:44:59,740
And we would love that, too, because they are our friends here at the Voice of the Youth Network.

1492
01:44:59,740 --> 01:45:02,740
So anyway, let's move on.

1493
01:45:02,740 --> 01:45:05,740
Other rapid fire news from Dark Sakura.

1494
01:45:05,740 --> 01:45:09,740
Yeah, it is very sad, but Sega has confirmed the end of Sega ages.

1495
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:14,740
However, they're going to be doing more stuff for Switch and revisiting past titles.

1496
01:45:14,740 --> 01:45:22,740
But it was confirmed in Game Watch from Okunari Yosuke basically said that there's no future plan for.

1497
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:31,740
Oh, hot dog for. Sorry, my husband brought me food for any other any other games in the future.

1498
01:45:31,740 --> 01:45:35,740
The last one they did was here's a spy.

1499
01:45:35,740 --> 01:45:41,740
But, you know, they said there's more stuff from M2 that might be out.

1500
01:45:41,740 --> 01:45:46,740
And then also Streets of Rage 4 is getting some new content.

1501
01:45:46,740 --> 01:45:48,740
But we don't know when.

1502
01:45:48,740 --> 01:45:52,740
The Streets of Rage 4 is getting some new content, but we don't know when.

1503
01:45:52,740 --> 01:45:58,740
They're not telling us. They just said, yeah, it's happening. You'll find out eventually.

1504
01:45:58,740 --> 01:46:02,740
Suck on it. Not really.

1505
01:46:02,740 --> 01:46:04,740
Look forward to it. Please look forward to it.

1506
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:10,740
That marinates in Streets of Rage 4 as it is, which is like as far as like throwback titles go,

1507
01:46:10,740 --> 01:46:15,740
for better or for worse, Streets of Rage is a throwback title.

1508
01:46:15,740 --> 01:46:22,740
It's all the great things about 90s arcade beat em ups and all the things that feel a little stale about them in the year 2020 as well.

1509
01:46:22,740 --> 01:46:24,740
But you know what? I think it's a great throwback.

1510
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:26,740
Streets of Rage was Yuzo Koshiro.

1511
01:46:26,740 --> 01:46:31,740
No, of course, I know. Oh, yeah. And the music's fire, of course, is one of the best reasons to check it out.

1512
01:46:31,740 --> 01:46:34,740
All right. Let's travel. Oh, I'm sorry.

1513
01:46:34,740 --> 01:46:37,740
Let's travel around the world and check out some releases coming out this week.

1514
01:46:37,740 --> 01:46:40,740
So we'll start in the US with Loki.

1515
01:46:40,740 --> 01:46:43,740
All right. So this week we've got a few things.

1516
01:46:43,740 --> 01:46:52,740
So starting off with R.A. and the Secret of Seasons on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1517
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:56,740
Not to be confused with Ori and the whatever, whatever.

1518
01:46:56,740 --> 01:47:01,740
Yes. No, not to be confused with that. Crusader Kings 3 on PC, Mac and Linux.

1519
01:47:01,740 --> 01:47:06,740
Iron Harvest on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1520
01:47:06,740 --> 01:47:15,740
MX versus ATV All Out on Nintendo Switch. Spellbreak on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1521
01:47:15,740 --> 01:47:20,740
Tell me why. Chapter two on PC and Xbox One.

1522
01:47:20,740 --> 01:47:25,740
WRC9 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

Marvel's Avengers on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Stadia.

1525
01:47:34,740 --> 01:47:41,740

1526
01:47:41,740 --> 01:47:49,740
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1527
01:47:49,740 --> 01:47:53,740
World's End Club on iOS. That's it.

1528
01:47:53,740 --> 01:47:57,740
All right. Let's talk about Japan. So some of the releases in Japan this week.

1529
01:47:57,740 --> 01:48:03,740
Slay the Spire gets a localized release in Japan this week on September 3rd for Nintendo Switch.

1530
01:48:03,740 --> 01:48:08,740
And then also coming out in Japan, NBA 2K21. It's coming out there as well.

1531
01:48:08,740 --> 01:48:13,740
I guess it gets a world release of sorts. And Minecraft Dungeons gets a release on the Switch in Japan this week.

1532
01:48:13,740 --> 01:48:19,740
So they're catching up a little bit on some of the things that we've had here for a bit. So check that out.

1533
01:48:19,740 --> 01:48:22,740
On the PlayStation 4, we also have some releases.

1534
01:48:22,740 --> 01:48:27,740
We have Marvel's Avengers gets its Japanese release this week.

1535
01:48:28,740 --> 01:48:33,740
As well as I think that might be it actually in Japan this week.

1536
01:48:33,740 --> 01:48:37,740
I would have thought some of those. Oh, there it is. NBA 2K20. I was like, surely that's there.

1537
01:48:37,740 --> 01:48:39,740
NBA 2K21 is out in Japan this week as well.

1538
01:48:39,740 --> 01:48:45,740
And Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 also gets a combined release there in Japan this week.

1539
01:48:45,740 --> 01:48:49,740
Pretty cool. Dark Sakura, how about the UK?

1540
01:48:52,740 --> 01:48:54,740
Are you muted, Dark Sakura? Or am I just not here?

1541
01:48:54,740 --> 01:48:59,740
I am now. OK, I was. I was eating a hot dog because my husband loves me.

1542
01:48:59,740 --> 01:49:03,740
I understand. Yes, he feeds his wife.

1543
01:49:03,740 --> 01:49:13,740
So anyway, on the 31st, there's a bunch of stuff, by the way. On the 31st, we have MX vs ATV All Out.

1544
01:49:13,740 --> 01:49:22,740
On Switch, we have Crusader Kings 3 for PC, Marvel's Avengers Deluxe Edition, Marvel's Avengers Earth's Mightiest Edition.

1545
01:49:22,740 --> 01:49:28,740
And on September 2nd, we have WRC 9 on the third.

1546
01:49:28,740 --> 01:49:33,740
This is pretty much everything else is coming out on the third road to Guangdong.

1547
01:49:33,740 --> 01:49:44,740
Wiley Jetman, Astro Monkey's Revenge Sweeper Edition, NBA 2K21, The Sojourn, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2, The Persistence Hode, Ministry of Broadcast.

1548
01:49:44,740 --> 01:49:46,740
That just sounds like a cool name.

1549
01:49:46,740 --> 01:49:52,740
Marvel's Avengers, Minecraft Dungeons, Kingdoms of Amalur Re-Reckoning.

1550
01:49:52,740 --> 01:49:57,740
Oh, actually, I'm getting way past that. Those last two were from the seventh. OK, I'm done.

1551
01:49:57,740 --> 01:50:03,740
You know what? We're not here next week, so it's OK. You give them a sneak peek of what to look forward to in a couple of weeks.

1552
01:50:03,740 --> 01:50:09,740
Alright, well then also, Ninja Legends on the 10th, Initial Drift, Holy Potatoes Compendium.

1553
01:50:09,740 --> 01:50:11,740
And that's all I'm going to do.

1554
01:50:11,740 --> 01:50:17,740
Every potato is holy, in my opinion. Alright, except I'm not as big on sweet potatoes.

1555
01:50:17,740 --> 01:50:20,740
I'm going to be honest. I know it's a big thing for some people, not really.

1556
01:50:20,740 --> 01:50:23,740
I'm a big fan of purple mountain yams.

1557
01:50:23,740 --> 01:50:30,740
Alright, let's move on with some more stories and then we'll get to the listener roundtable. First off, Loki.

1558
01:50:30,740 --> 01:50:37,740
Alright, so there's a new mobile AR game coming because there's not enough of those.

1559
01:50:37,740 --> 01:50:45,740
This time it is in the Witcher universe, so it's the Witcher Monster Slayer.

1560
01:50:45,740 --> 01:50:52,740
And it's your typical AR game where you're going to be fighting monsters and in the first person.

1561
01:50:52,740 --> 01:50:58,740
Kind of reminds me a little bit of that Walking Dead AR game that they had.

1562
01:50:58,740 --> 01:51:04,740
I don't know if it's the same company that puts it out, but yeah, it looks OK.

1563
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:14,740
I mean, obviously the trailer they show of it doesn't really show you anything in like literally less than a second of the gameplay there, but I don't know.

1564
01:51:14,740 --> 01:51:20,740
Yeah, so it's being developed by Spocco, who I have never heard of.

1565
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:29,740
But yeah, apparently that is the new hotness in the location gaming space.

1566
01:51:29,740 --> 01:51:39,740
We'll see. I mean, some of those games come out like garbage, like Garfield Go. Remember that one? That was a real piece of work.

1567
01:51:39,740 --> 01:51:45,740
Some people were, and there was a Ghostbusters game that I think kind of came and went pretty quick.

1568
01:51:45,740 --> 01:51:49,740
There's a Walking Dead game that kind of came and went real quick.

1569
01:51:49,740 --> 01:51:55,740
The Jurassic Park one, I played that for a little bit. It was OK. I didn't get super into it, but I know other people did.

1570
01:51:55,740 --> 01:52:02,740
Like, I know people that will play Pokemon Go and that. See, I kind of found that my limit is three, and three is a lot.

1571
01:52:02,740 --> 01:52:09,740
And if Pokemon didn't have the Bluetooth, I probably couldn't do three. But I play Ingress, I play Pokemon Go, and I play Orna.

1572
01:52:09,740 --> 01:52:13,740
And those are the three I can do. I gave up Harry Potter. Harry Potter's gone.

1573
01:52:13,740 --> 01:52:22,740
But that, you know, I know that's another popular AR game. That's also a Niantic-based one, so they've got a really great database of stuff in there.

1574
01:52:22,740 --> 01:52:25,740
All right. We'll see how The Witcher turns out.

1575
01:52:25,740 --> 01:52:37,740
I think the thing that makes the Niantic games really, really work is that the populated system of interesting places that, granted, is all user-made.

1576
01:52:37,740 --> 01:52:41,740
And I know it has its problems in rural areas, but it's getting better.

1577
01:52:41,740 --> 01:52:48,740
I think that population or that database of all those cool locations is what really boosts those games.

1578
01:52:48,740 --> 01:52:56,740
Because then when you look at a game like Jurassic World or whatever, they're in random places. Everything's in random places.

1579
01:52:56,740 --> 01:53:03,740
And the one thing I liked about Orna, or still like about Orna, is that you can build your own stuff in the world.

1580
01:53:03,740 --> 01:53:11,740
And I would like to see more games like that, where you're literally building your own stuff that affects other players as well, if you wanted to.

1581
01:53:11,740 --> 01:53:15,740
You can also keep it private, so that you're not giving away where your house is, which is a smart thing to do.

1582
01:53:15,740 --> 01:53:22,740
But I like that, though. If you're limited on where, especially in a pandemic when you're supposed to be staying at home,

1583
01:53:22,740 --> 01:53:28,740
I do like that you can build things nearby so that you have those resources.

1584
01:53:28,740 --> 01:53:32,740
But at the same time, there's still things that you have to go out and find.

1585
01:53:32,740 --> 01:53:36,740
So I like that quite a bit that they make it simple like that.

1586
01:53:37,740 --> 01:53:47,740
So we'll see if The Witcher ends up being on the Harry Potter, pretty decent AR game side of things, Jurassic World, or on the Garfield side of things.

1587
01:53:47,740 --> 01:53:58,740
Well, CD Projekt now, they own the majority stake in this company, so they probably will have quite a bit of influence on it. So hopefully that's a good thing.

1588
01:53:58,740 --> 01:54:07,740
They must believe in it. Well, let's talk about the Game Awards for the year 2020, because the Game Awards take place every December.

1589
01:54:07,740 --> 01:54:11,740
And Dark Soccer, are you okay?

1590
01:54:11,740 --> 01:54:19,740
Your mute is in the wrong place, because I think we just heard what you didn't want us to hear, and now we don't hear you.

1591
01:54:22,740 --> 01:54:24,740
You're still muted, my friend.

1592
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:27,740
Sorry, I bumped my mute button as I was burping.

1593
01:54:27,740 --> 01:54:34,740
And I did it by complete accident, so now I'm a fucking lady, okay.

1594
01:54:34,740 --> 01:54:37,740
Guess what, everybody, women burp.

1595
01:54:37,740 --> 01:54:43,740
We fart, we take big huge dumps when we have to, we are human.

1596
01:54:43,740 --> 01:54:44,740
Get over it.

1597
01:54:47,740 --> 01:54:48,740
Alright.

1598
01:54:50,740 --> 01:54:53,740
This lesson brought to you by Dark Sagra. Alright.

1599
01:54:55,740 --> 01:54:56,740
Moving on.

1600
01:54:57,740 --> 01:55:01,740
See, there is my mute button, and it is obnoxiously easy to hit.

1601
01:55:01,740 --> 01:55:08,740
You know, this show has never been nominated for a Game Award, and I can't possibly imagine why.

1602
01:55:08,740 --> 01:55:12,740
Because people often know who you are in order to be like an influencer.

1603
01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:13,740
We got an award.

1604
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:20,740
We did, not a Game Award, we got a podcast award in like, what, 2004, but we...

1605
01:55:21,740 --> 01:55:22,740
Alright.

1606
01:55:22,740 --> 01:55:26,740
No, we love the awards that we've won and have been nominated for.

1607
01:55:26,740 --> 01:55:32,740
I'll never forget that live 365 award ceremony where they forgot our name.

1608
01:55:32,740 --> 01:55:37,740
And you can hear it in the recording when they're saying like, and nominated for Station of the Year.

1609
01:55:37,740 --> 01:55:38,740
We have dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

1610
01:55:38,740 --> 01:55:44,740
And then like she starts to open the envelope and you hear Loki on the official recording in the back of the room.

1611
01:55:44,740 --> 01:55:45,740
Hey!

1612
01:55:45,740 --> 01:55:46,740
Hey!

1613
01:55:49,740 --> 01:55:51,740
And she goes, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, and Orange Sounds Radio.

1614
01:55:51,740 --> 01:55:53,740
And it was like, and that was the moment.

1615
01:55:53,740 --> 01:55:56,740
I know, we were like, well, we didn't win, obviously.

1616
01:55:57,740 --> 01:55:59,740
Guess we'll get another drink.

1617
01:55:59,740 --> 01:56:00,740
I want something.

1618
01:56:00,740 --> 01:56:01,740
I want the speakers.

1619
01:56:01,740 --> 01:56:03,740
You want a, yeah, that's right.

1620
01:56:03,740 --> 01:56:06,740
I'm glad we didn't all go home empty handed that night.

1621
01:56:06,740 --> 01:56:14,740
Oh, yeah, I also got, what was it, like an IR remote, like a TV remote for my computer for some reason.

1622
01:56:15,740 --> 01:56:17,740
I didn't get shit.

1623
01:56:17,740 --> 01:56:26,740
I didn't get, the one thing I remember from that night as well, because we all, it's, you know, now that we all kind of have our, we all have our own things.

1624
01:56:26,740 --> 01:56:29,740
So it's very rare and especially obviously we're in a pandemic.

1625
01:56:29,740 --> 01:56:34,740
We don't get to do anything together now, but it's rarely that the three of us get to go on a complete adventure together.

1626
01:56:34,740 --> 01:56:36,740
Like we went to PAX together that one year.

1627
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:37,740
That was a lot of fun.

1628
01:56:37,740 --> 01:56:40,740
But we all went to the live 365 awards in the Bay Area together.

1629
01:56:40,740 --> 01:56:54,740
And I remember when the car, we parked the car and the first space I wanted, I couldn't take because some fucking limo or something, or no, it wasn't even a limo, but just like a large car had took up like three parking spaces.

1630
01:56:54,740 --> 01:56:57,740
And Dark Sakura goes, give me a, give me a post-it.

1631
01:56:57,740 --> 01:56:58,740
You have post-its in here, right?

1632
01:56:58,740 --> 01:57:03,740
And I'm like, I have Hello Kitty, Hello Kitty post-its and Dark Sakura was like, perfect.

1633
01:57:03,740 --> 01:57:12,740
And she takes a piece of Hello Kitty stationary post-it and puts, you park like an asshole and puts it on the car.

1634
01:57:12,740 --> 01:57:14,740
I still do that.

1635
01:57:14,740 --> 01:57:25,740
But it's just, it wasn't just that you left a note that said you park like an asshole, but you put it on Hello Kitty stationary is what literally drives that home.

1636
01:57:25,740 --> 01:57:27,740
Anyway, where were we?

1637
01:57:27,740 --> 01:57:31,740
I need to, I actually do have a Hello Kitty stationary that I keep at my desk.

1638
01:57:31,740 --> 01:57:34,740
I should just start carrying it with me and do that some more.

1639
01:57:34,740 --> 01:57:35,740
All right.

1640
01:57:35,740 --> 01:57:38,740
Anyhow, excuse me, back to the Game Awards.

1641
01:57:38,740 --> 01:57:42,740
So a ceremony nobody will be parking at this year because it's going to be all virtual.

1642
01:57:42,740 --> 01:57:43,740
It's the Game Awards.

1643
01:57:43,740 --> 01:57:47,740
So 2020 Game Awards is going to be going virtual.

1644
01:57:47,740 --> 01:57:54,740
Jeff Keeley confirmed this in a recent interview with IGN saying, quote, what I will say about is this.

1645
01:57:54,740 --> 01:57:56,740
We have a very interesting plan for the show this year.

1646
01:57:56,740 --> 01:57:57,740
We're definitely doing it.

1647
01:57:57,740 --> 01:57:59,740
A lot of people are asking, are you delaying it?

1648
01:57:59,740 --> 01:58:01,740
The Oscars are being postponed.

1649
01:58:01,740 --> 01:58:02,740
Are you postponing the Game Awards?

1650
01:58:02,740 --> 01:58:03,740
We are not.

1651
01:58:03,740 --> 01:58:07,740
We'll share more in the coming weeks, but it's actually probably going to be our biggest show yet.

1652
01:58:07,740 --> 01:58:12,740
We're not going to have 10,000 people in a room together, but I think you'll see a little bit of this with how we do Gamescom.

1653
01:58:12,740 --> 01:58:15,740
We're definitely doing more than just me in a room announcing winners.

1654
01:58:15,740 --> 01:58:19,740
I'm really passionate about still doing the show live versus something prerecorded.

1655
01:58:19,740 --> 01:58:27,740
So, yeah, we're working on some scenarios for ways we can present the show live with a bit of a spectacle to people without the public being able to buy tickets to come to the show and things like that this year.

1656
01:58:27,740 --> 01:58:36,740
You know, and I have to admit, like I, I don't think the show is going to lose that much without having the audience there live.

1657
01:58:36,740 --> 01:58:41,740
In fact, in some ways, I kind of think that might be a detract from the show right now.

1658
01:58:41,740 --> 01:58:53,740
So, I kind of think when they have to just focus on the nominees, the game announcements, the creators that will undoubtedly be there on Zoom and so forth, I think it could be a very interesting show this year.

1659
01:58:53,740 --> 01:58:55,740
So, we'll see.

1660
01:58:55,740 --> 01:58:59,740
Some comments from our Twitch chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

1661
01:58:59,740 --> 01:59:05,740
Black Compat says, I'm interested to see what will be in the categories this year for the Game Awards.

1662
01:59:05,740 --> 01:59:08,740
That's true because they do tend to mix up the categories.

1663
01:59:08,740 --> 01:59:27,740
Are they going to maybe do something that relates to this whole maybe pandemic situation that we're in like best game to play in 2020 in the state of the world and it's Jackbox Party Pack Part Six, Jackbox Party Pack Part Five, Jackbox Party Pack Part Four, and so on.

1664
01:59:27,740 --> 01:59:41,740
Bobby says, it's really just about the game announcements. Now the good thing is if they need less money they can spend more time on the awards. There is that too. So, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm curious to see what this looks like in virtual form.

1665
01:59:41,740 --> 01:59:53,740
You know, and this kind of came up when we were talking about conventions and it was really on Bobby's show, because he was kind of talking about missing the in person conventions and there was a, there was a discussion that was happening in chat about how, you know,

1666
01:59:53,740 --> 02:00:00,740
some people hoped that maybe the virtual convention idea stays around forever.

1667
02:00:00,740 --> 02:00:15,740
And I think ultimately we all know you know we talked about what is the new normal. What is this world going to look like when we finally get to the other side of COVID and you know some some people say and reasonably so COVID will probably never go away.

1668
02:00:15,740 --> 02:00:28,740
But we'll just get it under control like measles is a good example measles is not eradicated measles is still on this planet, but generally you don't have a problem with measles in the US because most people get vaccinated for it, and we reasonably have that disease

1669
02:00:28,740 --> 02:00:42,740
under control. Hopefully that's where we get COVID to. But what does our new normal look like as a result of that and I know I've said on this show before, I think masks and wearing masks when you're sick and that I think we're going to see.

1670
02:00:42,740 --> 02:00:55,740
I think we're going to see this country at least certain parts of this country big cities, because we all know there's people that are pushing back on masks. I'm not going to go there, but I think I think generally in the big cities, you're going to see us

1671
02:00:55,740 --> 02:01:06,740
kind of picking up some cultural norms that have been done in Asia for a long time is that when people are sick and they're on the subway they're wearing a fucking mask, because people are going to own all these masks now.

1672
02:01:06,740 --> 02:01:12,740
So, you know, I kind of think that will be around. But also, when to get to the point.

1673
02:01:12,740 --> 02:01:22,740
I think some of the ways that we've adopted the virtual world, just like it's going to change our corporate jobs I think many more people are going to work from home now that they've proven they can do it.

1674
02:01:22,740 --> 02:01:30,740
I think that's going to change the culture significantly not everybody's I can affect everybody at every job, but I think there are many organizations that are going to adopt more work at home.

1675
02:01:30,740 --> 02:01:48,740
But I also think this idea of how do we blend the virtual with the in person. I think we're going to see a lot of that. After this, you know, most people know how to use zoom in this country after this point, which is a weird thing to think about but they

1676
02:01:48,740 --> 02:02:00,740
they use zoom with schools they use zooms with work they use zoom with meetings, most, and whatever, insert Microsoft Teams Discord whatever you're using to video chat with people.

1677
02:02:00,740 --> 02:02:12,740
That's going to be embedded in our culture so I just I kind of feel like whatever virtual form the game awards ends up taking this year. There may be a taste of that in future game awards.

1678
02:02:12,740 --> 02:02:14,740
If that makes sense.

1679
02:02:14,740 --> 02:02:20,740
Michael I've talked for a lot on that do I co host have any thoughts on that.

1680
02:02:20,740 --> 02:02:22,740
I've seen already happening.

1681
02:02:22,740 --> 02:02:24,740
How so.

1682
02:02:24,740 --> 02:02:40,740
Well, just that because we are looking at, you know, you get more people saying, Oh, when do I tune into this online, you know, for example, we have a lot of that, or, you know, people just assuming already that it's not going to be an in person event.

1683
02:02:40,740 --> 02:02:43,740
But mines are already leaning in that direction.

1684
02:02:43,740 --> 02:02:52,740
And, you know, and I'm even, you know, just in talking to other people's like, Oh, I think I have a cold let me grab my mask.

1685
02:02:52,740 --> 02:02:56,740
You know, I am seeing that a lot more often so it's happening. Yeah.

1686
02:02:56,740 --> 02:03:08,740
And then some comments from our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network as she says, I can foresee cons and fests offering a digital only pass where you can see streamed panels from the show archive things and some interactive stuff.

1687
02:03:08,740 --> 02:03:17,740
I can totally see that happening from this point on. It's just a revenue stream that can't be ignored. The only problem is infrastructure due to stream stuff from these events.

1688
02:03:17,740 --> 02:03:28,740
Yeah, and you know even dragon con had the dragon con TV pass you could buy I think you had to still like they only sold it to people that actually attended dragon con Bobby correct me if I'm wrong but I feel like that was the thing.

1689
02:03:28,740 --> 02:03:43,740
But I feel like maybe after this year. They, they may kind of have something a little more open with the I mean, obviously, nothing is going to be able to totally replace that being in the same room being there and all that.

1690
02:03:43,740 --> 02:03:51,740
But I think this is really going to make us think about what can we also offer for the people who don't want to, or can't.

1691
02:03:51,740 --> 02:03:57,740
And I kind of feel like that might get enhanced a little bit moving forward, we'll see. We'll see.

1692
02:03:57,740 --> 02:03:58,740
All right.

1693
02:03:58,740 --> 02:04:12,740
Let's move on. Anyway, I spent a lot of time on this topic. Let's move on. And Bobby Blackfield says dragon con TV never broadcast live on the internet. The on demand stuff was just repeats, and that's why they only sold it to the people that went anyway that's or I'm adding that part.

1694
02:04:12,740 --> 02:04:22,740
And that makes sense. So, and DJ rama SS current infrastructure and most hotels and convention centers cannot handle high bandwidths of streaming content.

1695
02:04:22,740 --> 02:04:29,740
I don't disagree with that. But I think due to all this.

1696
02:04:29,740 --> 02:04:41,740
I don't think that is going to be an excuse that these convention centers can have much longer. They're going to have to get with the times and get that type of bandwidth, and I understand easier said than done.

1697
02:04:41,740 --> 02:04:51,740
You can never totally foresee the amount and so on and so on but I do feel like this is something that that industry is going to struggle with and have to work with as we move back.

1698
02:04:51,740 --> 02:04:58,740
Anyway, I do want to move on for time sake but some great great comments, a dark soccer What do we have next.

1699
02:04:58,740 --> 02:05:08,740
Well, um, there is going to be another adaption for Resident Evil, but it's another live action series and it's going to be on Netflix.

1700
02:05:08,740 --> 02:05:18,740
It was announced that it will be focused on the Wesker kids so I guess referring to Albert Wesker who's like, you know, one of the main bad guys.

1701
02:05:18,740 --> 02:05:36,740
I understand that the first season will have eight one hour episodes it's actually written by one of the writers for Supernatural, Andrew Dabin, and the first two episodes will be directed by Bronwyn Hughes who did some walking dead and Breaking Bad.

1702
02:05:36,740 --> 02:05:45,740
I don't know how I feel about it, just because I wish that they would go back and do something, you know, more based directly off of the games and not just like these little side stories.

1703
02:05:45,740 --> 02:05:49,740
I mean, but they have to do they have to do to make money off of it I guess.

1704
02:05:49,740 --> 02:05:59,740
But Resident Evil really is seeing this resurgence with all the game remake so it only, you know, stands to reason they try to you know milk that cow a little bit more.

1705
02:05:59,740 --> 02:06:13,740
Yeah, and maybe, maybe doing the story like this kind of helps the series not get compared to the games, you know what I mean, like it's like, oh, they didn't do it that way because they did it in the games they got it wrong, like it's going to kind of avoid that

1706
02:06:13,740 --> 02:06:23,740
by doing a separate story so that may be part of it right yeah but but at the same time I mean, we've got like two different continuity is now.

1707
02:06:23,740 --> 02:06:33,740
Well, I'll be perfectly honest the things that I always enjoyed outside of the games were those CG movies that they did like degeneration.

1708
02:06:33,740 --> 02:06:36,740
Those were fun. I love those.

1709
02:06:36,740 --> 02:06:46,740
I actually I think I'm funny the first one of those that I watched was simply because it had on it's doing the soundtrack in it and I ended up loving the movie.

1710
02:06:46,740 --> 02:06:48,740
So,

1711
02:06:48,740 --> 02:06:56,740
I don't know, I mean, I don't really have a lot of hopes I didn't, you know, watch many of the movies past like a couple of them.

1712
02:06:56,740 --> 02:07:16,740
So I don't really have a lot of notion preconceived notion for this one, although you know I love Supernatural so I like most of the writing for Supernatural so I am really looking forward to seeing if that same writing prowess, you know translates

1713
02:07:16,740 --> 02:07:24,740
over to Resident Evil fairly well. I'm also very sad about this being the last season of Supernatural, I'm a little bitter, a little.

1714
02:07:24,740 --> 02:07:28,740
It's been it's had a hell of a run they've been doing it 15 years they're allowed to retire.

1715
02:07:28,740 --> 02:07:44,740
So, with Resident Evil though the Netflix, you know, video game stuffs really been hitting it out of the park recently between The Witcher and Castlevania, so I can see, you know, and we this subject has come up on the show before how it seems like there's

1716
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:57,740
just like this avalanche of gaming content about to be released because of the success of those things, such as we know there's a Final Fantasy 14 series in the works there's, there's plenty of other stuff to that it's just escaping me in the moment.

1717
02:07:57,740 --> 02:08:11,740
There's lots of stuff that's in the works and I think Resident Evil is just the first one where it's like, oh, now we're seeing a picture of a script we're seeing some other details like the it's happening like that, you know, this is this is for real real now not just talk.

1718
02:08:11,740 --> 02:08:22,740
Yeah, I don't know I, I'm gonna, I'd like to just with just about anything these days I, I would rather reserve my judgment that be super disappointed. Yeah, fair enough.

1719
02:08:22,740 --> 02:08:26,740
All right, let's move on to our next story Loki.

1720
02:08:26,740 --> 02:08:29,740
All right.

1721
02:08:29,740 --> 02:08:38,740
So let's talk a little bit about Fall Guys, because that is a very popular game nowadays in fact it's so popular it's the most downloaded PlayStation Plus game ever.

1722
02:08:38,740 --> 02:08:43,740
I played a little today, and lost on the second level, but I played a little.

1723
02:08:43,740 --> 02:08:50,740
Yeah, I mean I'm sure a lot of that was because it was, you know, free obviously PlayStation Plus and everything but it's very popular.

1724
02:08:50,740 --> 02:08:56,740
And then, of course, you know with season two right around the corner I'm sure it's just gonna become more popular.

1725
02:08:56,740 --> 02:08:59,740
Of course, as most popular things are.

1726
02:08:59,740 --> 02:09:17,740
They are modded into other games and so because of that, you know, the common games you would see mods for like Skyrim for example has a fallout or fall fall guys followers mod that you can get which is looks hilarious.

1727
02:09:17,740 --> 02:09:23,740
And then of course there's also some Resident Evil three mods that allow you.

1728
02:09:23,740 --> 02:09:29,740
It's called a jelly bean turns Jill Carlos and nemesis into beans.

1729
02:09:29,740 --> 02:09:36,740
It looks pretty silly. So, I'm gonna have to definitely check out the one for Skyrim. Yeah, sounds funny.

1730
02:09:36,740 --> 02:09:45,740
I would like to see you remember that mod that allows you to like roll 10,000 cabbages down a hill. How about 10,000 fall guys.

1731
02:09:45,740 --> 02:09:52,740
10,000 cabbages that's not even a mod that's just just a game you can just spawn that stuff in.

1732
02:09:52,740 --> 02:09:57,740
I'd like to see 10,000 fall guys falling down the hill will be fun. Sounds good. All right.

1733
02:09:57,740 --> 02:10:10,740
Lastly, before we get to wrapping things up tonight. Bobby Black Wolf, are you out there you paying attention because I've got a story for you. And this is going to definitely be a game of the year contender for you.

1734
02:10:10,740 --> 02:10:24,740
Okay, there's a little bit of an inside joke here that is really been beaten into the ground over the past few years. But how about one more inside joke for Nino Cooney because Nino Cooney, they just announced this week is going to be getting an MMO.

1735
02:10:24,740 --> 02:10:38,740
It's called Nino Cooney cross worlds, and I do I feel like the story, maybe Bobby Black Wolf inspired because wait till you hear this in the game now, Nino Cooney explores like the link between worlds that's what this is about.

1736
02:10:38,740 --> 02:10:44,740
But in this game you are going to be a VR game beta tester.

1737
02:10:44,740 --> 02:10:48,740
That's right, VR is part of the plot you pay attention Bobby.

1738
02:10:48,740 --> 02:11:03,740
I've already lost interest, but this game, you just well the game itself isn't VR but it's part of the story. So you are playing the role of a VR game beta tester and you discover the world of the VR game is real.

1739
02:11:03,740 --> 02:11:26,740
Right, it's kinda, it's kinda dot hack like that. I was just about to say that. So anyway, it's only been confirmed for Japanese iOS and Android phones, but I'm sure our pal Bobby would appreciate it if you would start your hashtag campaigns to ensure that we get an English and localized release for this game as well.

1740
02:11:26,740 --> 02:11:33,740
There's no exact date or anything like that. But, I mean, it does look, it looks not it looks pretty.

1741
02:11:33,740 --> 02:11:45,740
I only think it's kind of disappointing because I'm like wow, this is so pretty I'd want to play it on a console, but okay the mobile phones get to have good things once in a while, and again if it's designed for mobile phones, it might not be such a bad mobile

1742
02:11:45,740 --> 02:12:00,740
phone game. Games that are designed with the phone in mind tend to do all right so I'm curious. We will see. Anyway, what's that, Rob. There are really beautiful people who are garbage inside their hearts.

1743
02:12:00,740 --> 02:12:11,740
It looks pretty is not an indication of how good that game is going to be. That, that is, that is very true. Yeah, yeah, just saying research your judgment don't get too excited.

1744
02:12:11,740 --> 02:12:23,740
Yeah, that's true. There's a very, especially this year. I don't know, it's like everyone 2020 all I was like, shut up about politics Rob shut up about politics Rob show up about okay I can't help myself.

1745
02:12:23,740 --> 02:12:36,740
Okay, so like, what's her name, the ex wife of Gavin Newsom that gave that speech, where she looked like she was Madonna and Evita going.

1746
02:12:37,740 --> 02:12:41,740
Like if I was actually more thinking of Ivanka.

1747
02:12:41,740 --> 02:12:52,740
If she's a very, she's a very pretty, pretty smart person if I pass garbage, if I pass them on the street, I would be like she's really pretty. I bet that's a great wig.

1748
02:12:52,740 --> 02:12:54,740
Your makeup is beautiful.

1749
02:12:54,740 --> 02:13:01,740
But, you know. All right, anyway. Oh, let's get some comments from Bobby Blackwell.

1750
02:13:01,740 --> 02:13:06,740
Bobby Blackwell for saying I Nino Cooney trying too hard. Stay in Japan.

1751
02:13:06,740 --> 02:13:15,740
Hashtag say Nino to Nino Cooney MMO in America.

1752
02:13:15,740 --> 02:13:19,740
Say Nino nice to Nino Cooney that's a good one Bobby.

1753
02:13:19,740 --> 02:13:26,740
You had to know that was coming for 12345 stories, so you marinating on that one.

1754
02:13:26,740 --> 02:13:42,740
I love it. All right. Anyhow, let's move on. It's time for the listener roundtable if you guys have any questions, ask away in our chat anything that we have or maybe haven't talked about yet tonight on the show, please feel free to pop that in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network.

1755
02:13:42,740 --> 02:14:01,740
We would also take this opportunity to check our mailbag every week you guys can email us participate at orange lounge radio.com, but I believe in checking with postmaster dark Sakura, who's a better postmaster than the one that's running the you anyway, the mailbag is empty right.

1756
02:14:01,740 --> 02:14:13,740
Yeah. All right, bummer. Well maybe next week participate at orange lounge radio.com. However, I will take this opportunity to mention we had a comment over at vog network.com on last week's show.

1757
02:14:13,740 --> 02:14:18,740
But before I get to that comment I think Loki you have an obligation to have to step away right.

1758
02:14:18,740 --> 02:14:28,740
Yes I do refrigerator drama. All right. Oh boy, well the garage that needs to be in the kitchen. All right, we have to replace our refrigerator soon so it'll be my turn next probably.

1759
02:14:28,740 --> 02:14:34,740
All right, well I hope everything's okay. Did you have any last minute, or I'm sorry not last sorry. Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight.

1760
02:14:34,740 --> 02:14:42,740
No, just have a good week. I'll see you in a few weeks. Oh yeah, we'll see you in two weeks Loki, thank you and good luck with refrigerator drama.

1761
02:14:42,740 --> 02:14:43,740
Right.

1762
02:14:43,740 --> 02:14:57,740
All right. And then it was just me and dark soccer here on discord the discord image will fix itself in a moment here, but I do want to read this comment here from e three v l because you can leave comments over at vog network.com on episodes, and I haven't

1763
02:14:57,740 --> 02:15:12,740
always been great about reading those on air, but since we've tried to consolidate the roundtable a little bit it reminds me to check on that. So I will point out e three v l commented on the last episode fall guys is free on PS plus, as long as you have a subscription,

1764
02:15:12,740 --> 02:15:26,740
you must claim it by the end of the month so yeah time is running out on that by the way and I think I saw in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network black compat said, haven't downloaded it yet but plan to and yeah I would get on that my friend, because he

1765
02:15:26,740 --> 02:15:38,740
had tomorrow I think is the last day you're gonna be able to grab that. So, get out because, yeah, I don't know if they expected fall guys to do as well as it has. So it's only going to be a matter of time before they want to start charging money for that again

1766
02:15:38,740 --> 02:15:55,740
so, but thank you for that e three v l and also of importance, e three v l gives their Animal Crossing new horizons island dream code for us to visit, potentially on the next episode of Animal Crossing lounge radio, which I need to check and make sure nobody else

1767
02:15:55,740 --> 02:16:05,740
is using that title I just figured why would anyone use Animal Crossing lounge radio, you would do you do you remember my spin off show courthouse.

1768
02:16:05,740 --> 02:16:11,740
Yeah. Did you know that at one point I considered calling that show Warcraft lounge radio.

1769
02:16:11,740 --> 02:16:25,740
And you know what, what another another show started the week before courthouse did called Warcraft lounge radio. I don't know if there's, I don't know if they're still going on what we don't we don't own the patent on lounge radio.

1770
02:16:25,740 --> 02:16:39,740
They can do it was a fine. It was a fine show I have nothing negative to say about it is one of those I hope nobody beat us to it. Yeah. Anyway, maybe some, maybe somebody, maybe Tiger claws looking right now maybe.

1771
02:16:39,740 --> 02:16:53,740
I don't know who knows. Anyway, act deft in talking about the refrigerator issues that Loki is having says if only it were easy to move stuff like an Animal Crossing, everything turns into a leaf.

1772
02:16:53,740 --> 02:17:05,740
That's right, except with my luck I'd keep picking the wrong thing. Like I would be trying to pick up this desk and I tried to pick it up and then all of a sudden I just pulled the posters down from the wall.

1773
02:17:05,740 --> 02:17:07,740
So, anyway.

1774
02:17:07,740 --> 02:17:19,740
Bobby Blackwell says Google has no results for Warcraft lounge radio. Well, they might have pod faded they, this was, you know, courthouse was 2012, so it'd be pretty impressive if they were still going but I really don't know what about Animal Crossing

1775
02:17:19,740 --> 02:17:22,740
lounge radio. That's the one I, by the way.

1776
02:17:22,740 --> 02:17:31,740
You might be interested to know that I finally on Facebook retired the game archive to the danger squad group.

1777
02:17:31,740 --> 02:17:35,740
Oh, that's kind of sad that was our old Warcraft Guild.

1778
02:17:36,740 --> 02:17:52,740
I understand, I understand why you archive did I was like 10 years ago we were all rating there but it's always, it's always a moment of, oh, you know, you know what else I found, what's that I found the the thing that that.

1779
02:17:52,740 --> 02:17:57,740
Why can I not remember his nickname. Now, well quickly.

1780
02:17:57,740 --> 02:18:06,740
Bobby with a follow up saying the only results for Animal Crossing lounge radio is what came up on vog is vog stuff from our one episode we did so yay.

1781
02:18:06,740 --> 02:18:18,740
Slidekick. I do not know why I cannot remember his nickname because I was thinking of the drag name. He's also first mate slide kick on game buoy although their episodes have been unfortunately very sporadic in the pandemic but we understand.

1782
02:18:18,740 --> 02:18:27,740
Well, we had an idea for doing a comic. And I think you might remember this called Hills Brad blues.

1783
02:18:27,740 --> 02:18:33,740
And I just found all the, all the renders I pulled like you know five year old renders.

1784
02:18:33,740 --> 02:18:37,740
And the first panel of the comic we did.

1785
02:18:38,740 --> 02:18:53,740
We kind of flew by it at the top of the show but one of the things that was announced at that Gamescom event was that the official date for shadow lands the next Warcraft expansion is out which is October 27 I believe these are 27th in Europe, but I think

1786
02:18:53,740 --> 02:19:01,740
because of time zones it's actually like the, the 26th in the evening here, but we we have a general date for when that's coming out.

1787
02:19:01,740 --> 02:19:14,740
I, I don't know if it's gonna get me to play though, yeah, and that's where my head's at is that like I, I think I'm kind of done with wow but I don't know then if I, then I'm going to hear everybody, because I had that show Horde house.

1788
02:19:14,740 --> 02:19:26,740
I made a lot of Warcraft community friends. I went to BlizzCon and and did one of the pre events, years ago and I had a great time and I still have many friends I made in that community are just good people.

1789
02:19:26,740 --> 02:19:34,740
And I feel like when they all start lying about it on Twitter. It's gonna make me want to go.

1790
02:19:34,740 --> 02:19:38,740
Yes, it's FOMO right.

1791
02:19:38,740 --> 02:19:50,740
And I'll be honest, the biggest thing that really pushed me away from playing well from really enjoying it was the shit they pulled with Sylvanas, and I'm like, I'm done. Yeah, done. Yeah.

1792
02:19:50,740 --> 02:20:00,740
No more. I cannot stand it. As much as I freaking love that, you know, I had all this fun Illidan stuff and I was really getting into it I was so happy. And then they fucked over Sylvanas.

1793
02:20:00,740 --> 02:20:14,740
Yeah, and took away my demon elf husband. It was, it was really weird how they handled her story so I don't know I guess I'm gonna wait and see but I also feel like one MMO is really truly enough and you know FOMO SC 14 is just kind of where I'm at.

1794
02:20:14,740 --> 02:20:18,740
Do you know how many I might be. I'm still considering Star Trek online.

1795
02:20:18,740 --> 02:20:28,740
That's fun. Yeah, I, um, the folks that were with a starboard power coupling I know that show hasn't been out in a while but it was, it was a show here at vogue for a while.

1796
02:20:28,740 --> 02:20:41,740
Can Dr. Ken plays that game still pretty regularly I think and enjoys it so I made some really good friends, because when I was playing it I was super unemployed are fun employed.

1797
02:20:41,740 --> 02:20:56,740
And so I was playing late night and so most people I played with were in the UK and I'm still really good friends with a couple of people that that I played with a good architect friend lives in Edinburgh, so it's pretty fun.

1798
02:20:57,740 --> 02:20:59,740
Um, question in our chat.

1799
02:20:59,740 --> 02:21:13,740
Fat Ninja DM in chat asks, will you guys and gals be playing New World when it releases next year that is the Amazon MMO that they've been working on for forever. So I'm gonna, I'm gonna admit that game was not on my radar.

1800
02:21:13,740 --> 02:21:24,740
But I don't know, are they having an open beta or a closed beta something's going on with that game right now because I see people on Twitch streaming it, and one of my friends was streaming it the other night, and I have to say, it wasn't on my radar

1801
02:21:24,740 --> 02:21:41,740
but when I watched my friend stream I was like, okay, this looks interesting. I kind of like the way the magic was was kind of neat, like he was his character was up on a hill, and he was launching fireballs like they were bow and arrow down on this other group

1802
02:21:41,740 --> 02:21:55,740
of people like literally raining fire on them. And I was like, okay, that's like you know yes in Warcraft you also rain fire on people but it doesn't, it doesn't have that same feel that like of like oh there's like physics involved in this, this whole thing.

1803
02:21:55,740 --> 02:22:07,740
So, it kind of looked neat, I have to admit, my, my curiosity was not piqued until I saw it being played on Twitch, which happens right Twitch has been a great way to sample games right.

1804
02:22:08,740 --> 02:22:11,740
I really don't care about it.

1805
02:22:11,740 --> 02:22:16,740
And the big reason I don't care about it is because I don't want to care about it.

1806
02:22:16,740 --> 02:22:32,740
Right now, I have so much on my plate and such a backlog and I really want to get into more familiar territory with some of the games that I'm playing just things that are fun to me, and I don't really want to try anything super new in that respect that makes sense.

1807
02:22:32,740 --> 02:22:48,740
It does. It's like when you eat the same thing for lunch every day because it's really good and it makes you happy. Yeah, I'm doing I'm in the same game. I get that but, and, and probably you know it's not just because it's not Animal Crossing because I've got other games that I'm playing I have other things I'm looking forward to.

1808
02:22:48,740 --> 02:22:57,740
But I don't want to dip my toes into another MMO universe when I'm not doing any MMOs right now.

1809
02:22:57,740 --> 02:23:08,740
There's also and there's a big difference between the commitment for like an MMO, and the commitment for a game that like I recommended to you earlier in the show I think telling lies would be something up your alley.

1810
02:23:08,740 --> 02:23:21,740
Well, you can you can experience telling lies in like two three hours. You know, I'm not saying you're gonna get, but I think there's a bit there's that level of commitment, and I get that is that like you know I don't I don't have time to get sucked into another

1811
02:23:21,740 --> 02:23:32,740
MMO, but you know I do have time for this, this other little this puzzle game I can play in a short burst fall guys I can play for five minutes and be done with it, you know, or whatever it is.

1812
02:23:32,740 --> 02:23:44,740
And I can actually do some well on my own, how I got to level at in well by myself remember with anybody without doing a single dungeon.

1813
02:23:44,740 --> 02:23:48,740
You know I just did them all by myself, I like.

1814
02:23:48,740 --> 02:23:58,740
It's just the thing is that I don't, you know, it was kind of probably have a Final Fantasy 14 at first was that I couldn't just be through the, you know, do stuff in the game by myself and level that way effectively.

1815
02:23:58,740 --> 02:24:02,740
It kind of made me do that for the quest lines.

1816
02:24:02,740 --> 02:24:15,740
But you know Star Trek online, I could go in and just, you know, if I wanted to just futz around I could just you know take myself over to most of my characters probably still at quarks on Deep Space Nine.

1817
02:24:15,740 --> 02:24:27,740
But you know I could was some with something like that I could just sort of, you know, play around in it, you know, have like a good 10 minutes of just exploring doing a couple battles, going to plan it, boom I'm done.

1818
02:24:27,740 --> 02:24:39,740
And that was it. I don't really want to involve myself in a new MMO, and have to commit myself to learning its environment learning, it's.

1819
02:24:39,740 --> 02:24:56,740
It's a culture, because you know you're in a memo it's gonna have its own culture built into the game if it's any fucking good. So I really don't want to have to expose myself to that quite yet when there are other MMOs that I have enjoyed in the past

1820
02:24:56,740 --> 02:25:00,740
that I could be revisiting if I wanted to, which I do not.

1821
02:25:00,740 --> 02:25:10,740
And SJ100Matt has a good comparison here in chat saying it's like starting a new TV series with five plus seasons that you haven't seen, but everyone has seen it's a large commitment.

1822
02:25:10,740 --> 02:25:15,740
There are some shows you can't just have in the background that you have to focus on like Game of Thrones.

1823
02:25:15,740 --> 02:25:29,740
And yeah, like that's that's a great like it's very, it's very easy for me to say okay you know what, I can binge the Castlevania anime because there's only well now there's three seasons but there's one season and like six episodes.

1824
02:25:29,740 --> 02:25:42,740
I can do that. But yeah, when you start to get and this happens to me all the time is that like, even a show that I really enjoy like The Good Place and Shane is always saying when are you gonna finish that when are you gonna finish that it's like my backlog

1825
02:25:42,740 --> 02:25:50,740
keeps getting bigger and bigger I just don't know when I'm going to be able to do it but then some other smaller show will sneak in it's like oh yeah I binge it because it was only a couple hours.

1826
02:25:50,740 --> 02:25:54,740
So, it just just kind of depends on what you have room for at the time.

1827
02:25:54,740 --> 02:26:08,740
So, all right, well on that note I think we're going to wrap things up for the night and I will say, thank you for taking the time to work Orange Launch Radio into your week, whether you joined us here live on Sunday night, or you're listening to our podcast at some point

1828
02:26:08,740 --> 02:26:26,740
throughout the week on a platform like iTunes, Spotify, Google Podcasts, wherever it is that you listen to podcasts. Thank you so much for choosing Orange Launch Radio to fill quite a bit of your time, more than the normal podcast this week, but we make no apologies for the length of our show it's the way it's always been.

1829
02:26:26,740 --> 02:26:41,740
So thank you so much for checking us out. If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice but we need the voices to be here to help put them out on air.

1830
02:26:41,740 --> 02:26:50,740
A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this show goes a long way. Auto hosts for VOG Network on Twitch really go a long way.

1831
02:26:50,740 --> 02:27:01,740
Thank you to those you I wish I had a list that still showed me who did that Twitch took that away a while ago so I don't know who's hosting, but I will just say thank you if you are one of the people that does that we really really appreciate it.

1832
02:27:01,740 --> 02:27:13,740
On that note, I think we'll wrap things up, remember programming note we will not be here next week, due to virtual dragon con and the Labor Day holiday. I hope all of you out there in the states have a wonderful Labor Day holiday.

1833
02:27:14,740 --> 02:27:24,740
If you're somewhere else I hope you have a wonderful weekend whatever it is you're doing this weekend. Please be safe. Remember just because you're done with COVID doesn't mean COVID is done with you.

1834
02:27:24,740 --> 02:27:36,740
Please continue to wear your masks, social distance. Let's get through this we have some hopefully promising things that are going to help, such as this rapid test that's all up in the news these past couple days.

1835
02:27:36,740 --> 02:27:45,740
It's not going to fix it but it's going to help and hopefully we'll continue to make progress over the next few months but we've got to wear our masks. We've got a social distance and keep following the rules, so please keep that in mind.

1836
02:27:45,740 --> 02:27:50,740
Speaking of masks. Yeah. Did you see Lady Gaga's horn mask.

1837
02:27:50,740 --> 02:27:57,740
It's beautiful and I want one everyone I didn't have to show me that if you want to make wearing a mask interesting.

1838
02:27:57,740 --> 02:28:00,740
Do stuff to it. Keep it effective.

1839
02:28:00,740 --> 02:28:15,740
But go to town, make everybody think, Oh, gosh, this person is fashionable I want to be like them. I hated the idea of masks at first because I didn't like the idea of Heidi I mean I wore them for scientific reasons only, but I've warmed up to them a lot

1840
02:28:15,740 --> 02:28:23,740
because now I'm like, Oh, you can get masks that are fun and festive. It's kind of like underwear but it's like everybody can see it.

1841
02:28:23,740 --> 02:28:28,740
Underwear that's fun to wear. Yeah, exactly. Except it's like, over where I was.

1842
02:28:28,740 --> 02:28:34,740
I was having a chat with somebody at Oto's the other day is the local Japanese market.

1843
02:28:34,740 --> 02:28:48,740
And we were just talking about how they become like our fashion accessories here. I was like, Well, I mean, and and you know I'd already adapted, not, not like doing this like as a bow I did this earlier before everybody, but I had adopted wearing masks at work

1844
02:28:48,740 --> 02:28:57,740
if I had a cold or I was sick because I get sinus infection so often, but I wouldn't know if it was a sinus infection or if I had a cold or if I had the flu or something.

1845
02:28:57,740 --> 02:29:07,740
So for me, I always had these charcoal masks at my desk that I pick up a die so in a box, so that I was sick, I didn't get somebody else.

1846
02:29:07,740 --> 02:29:19,740
And right when everything started going on right before I got pneumonia. People were like, I heard you have masks, I heard you have masks, I'm like,

1847
02:29:19,740 --> 02:29:23,740
Bobby black, I hate wearing a bra.

1848
02:29:23,740 --> 02:29:32,740
Bobby black open chat says, I look at it kind of like ties, you can have fun ties if you have to wear a suit, I hate wearing a suit so wearing a fun tie makes it tolerable.

1849
02:29:32,740 --> 02:29:40,740
Same way with masks. Yes, I wear my mask I promise. So yeah, it's a little fun little fun to be had. All right, anyway, let's get our final thoughts.

1850
02:29:40,740 --> 02:29:47,740
I just say don't be a mass commando. Yeah, I'm dark soccer final thought tonight.

1851
02:29:47,740 --> 02:29:49,740
Party words for our listeners this week.

1852
02:29:49,740 --> 02:29:55,740
Two weeks old hot dog and it was amazing and also, I ordered you a thing.

1853
02:29:56,740 --> 02:30:07,740
I ordered you a thing yes I did. It's going to take a while to arrive. That's because of where I ordered it from, but I will give you a clue if you want to try to guess what it is.

1854
02:30:07,740 --> 02:30:10,740
Okay.

1855
02:30:10,740 --> 02:30:18,740
Um, I could go for the obvious and tell you that it is okay.

1856
02:30:18,740 --> 02:30:20,740
She's your favorite.

1857
02:30:20,740 --> 02:30:22,740
Atlantis.

1858
02:30:22,740 --> 02:30:24,740
No.

1859
02:30:24,740 --> 02:30:31,740
One of my favorites, one of my favorites, maybe it's just you brought up Gaga earlier maybe it's Gaga.

1860
02:30:31,740 --> 02:30:34,740
All right, not a living person.

1861
02:30:34,740 --> 02:30:36,740
Okay, interesting.

1862
02:30:36,740 --> 02:30:40,740
Okay. All right. All right. We'll see. We'll see. All right.

1863
02:30:40,740 --> 02:30:53,740
All right. Okay. Um, so that's, that's that we're all wrapped up for the night. My final thought would be, I kind of I guess I already kind of said it the whole thing I just said a minute ago is stay safe with with COVID and all that I don't need to

1864
02:30:53,740 --> 02:31:09,740
repeat myself. So, yeah, we'll see you in two weeks, I hope to see many of you at virtual dragon con. Please do consider participating will be hosting that here at vog network all weekend but of course, you can find all the programming for the track
