1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,640
I have fond memories of seeing SNK MVS cabinets in arcades, reading the cards for the list

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,360
of games and then jamming the switch game button to see if it's accurate.

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,520
Unico's MVSX classic system tickles my fancy in a way that modded cabinets never did, with

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,760
all the benefits of an LCD instead of a CRT and the optional stand speaks to its dramatically

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,900
increased portability due to weight alone.

6
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,380
This is just my opinion, but I know that your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki

7
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,260
also lived in the era of SNK proliferation, and they'll opine about this too, starting

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,740
right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:45,140
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

10
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,260
where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:53,980
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back again live tonight with episode number 832

12
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,140
of our show for this August the 16th of 2020.

13
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,260
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me tonight is Techmaster Loki.

14
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,260
Hello.

15
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,480
Hi Loki, how are you doing?

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,480
I'm doing good.

17
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,480
Awesome.

18
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,700
Not joining us tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers, she has the night off, but her presence

19
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,940
in the show lives on through that awesome new theme song.

20
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,900
If you haven't heard OLR in a while, we changed some things up a few months ago.

21
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,700
So that great new theme song by DarkSakura.

22
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,740
She'll be back next week with us live.

23
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:30,660
But I am joined by Techmaster Loki and all those of you in our chat over at twitch.tv

24
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:35,860
slash vog network or the voice geeks network, VOG network, because we do tape live every

25
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,700
Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf

26
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,520
show at twitch.tv slash vog network.

27
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,520
I just said it.

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,540
Anyhow, how are you doing, Loki?

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,100
You had a good week?

30
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,980
Yeah, it's been all right.

31
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,480
It is extremely hot this weekend.

32
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,860
I think a lot of the country is going through this, especially the West Coast.

33
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,300
But I'm here where the show is based in Sacramento, California.

34
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,860
I believe the temperature today was one hundred and nine.

35
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,620
It was more probably more than that.

36
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,060
I was like one hundred and twelve in the shade in my car.

37
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,060
Oh, my God.

38
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,380
Lisa's what said.

39
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:16,500
And then we had a had a guest appearance apparently in Northern California of a fire tornado.

40
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,500
So that was a thing.

41
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,500
Oh, yeah.

42
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,500
Twenty twenty.

43
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,500
What else is twenty twenty got for us?

44
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,500
We're already having to do this show over discord thanks to that whole pandemic that's

45
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,500
going on that you might have heard of.

46
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,700
And now we have fire tornadoes.

47
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,700
Lovely.

48
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,700
Yeah.

49
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,540
The weather was really crazy today because it was actually raining.

50
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:36,180
Like we have cloud cover and it was raining, but it is still over one hundred degrees outside.

51
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,780
And I'm like, this is not like usually when the clouds come in and the rain start, that

52
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,260
means you're going to get a lower temperature.

53
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,020
So it's it's weird.

54
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,660
And you know, I'm not I'm not going to say I know everything about meteorology.

55
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,340
Obviously, these types of things happen, but it's just I'm not used to it living here.

56
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,980
So, yeah, we're in a crazy heat wave right now.

57
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:59,500
I almost chose to do tonight's show with the light off and just sit in the dark and apologize

58
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,500
to the people.

59
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,340
We can do an are you afraid of the dark episode?

60
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,340
Right.

61
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,900
I oh, I could have done the episode by candlelight.

62
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,380
I wish I thought these things beforehand, but the truth is the light is all the way

63
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,380
over there.

64
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,380
It's an LED light.

65
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,340
So it doesn't really do a lot of heat, give off a lot of heat.

66
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,820
Honestly, a candle probably would have given off more heat.

67
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,060
So it's probably OK this way.

68
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,340
It's just, you know, trying to conserve all the electricity because they're really kind

69
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,180
of stressing to us here in California.

70
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,660
You got to conserve electricity because some areas are having rolling blackouts.

71
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,180
We have a government utility that runs things here in Sacramento.

72
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,600
There's a Sacramento municipal utility.

73
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:44,420
So I'm not as worried about shutoffs and things because they never have problems, but they

74
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,340
have their shit together.

75
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,140
Like you could say what you want about the government, but I've never had problems with

76
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,660
the energy company here.

77
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,500
So I'll actually be sad if I ever move out of city limits and have to go back to a different

78
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,500
company.

79
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,300
So is that we just need a government run Internet company as well so we can get that reliable,

80
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,820
fast Internet for less money than it would cost the third parties.

81
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,580
Some day, some day.

82
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:15,180
Bobby Blackwell in chat says, fun fact, I recorded my whole show on a camcorder just

83
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,740
off screen for reasons.

84
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,580
I have a feeling I might know what those reasons might be.

85
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,340
And I can't really tell you what they are.

86
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,880
But hey, in a related thing, maybe.

87
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,140
Did you know that Dragon Con is going virtual this year?

88
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,120
There's going to be a virtual Dragon Con event.

89
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,360
So you can actually participate from home and watch different channels that will have

90
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,720
different types of events.

91
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,860
And the good news is, is that the digital media track, which is one of the tracks that

92
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:47,060
I've worked with in the past, is going to be doing kind of their own like panel schedule

93
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,680
thing like they would do during the convention, except it's going to be all virtual and it's

94
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,300
going to be on Twitch.

95
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,760
And I'm going to be on three of the panels over the weekend.

96
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,000
So there and actually one of them is during OLR.

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,400
So in in the gray, that's going to be some multitasking you're doing there.

98
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,740
Well, I figured in the great tradition of the past seven years since we've never done

99
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,300
a show Labor Day weekend anyway, why should this year be any different?

100
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,940
So we'll probably just not do a show that night.

101
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,940
And I don't know.

102
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,720
I don't know if Bobby's doing a show that night after all or what, but I already kind

103
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,620
of told him we probably won't just because I'm doing a panel that starts at six o'clock

104
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,620
Pacific.

105
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,620
So, oops.

106
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,180
Well, hopefully they advertise it more than Comic-Con did, because, you know, that did

107
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,180
the same.

108
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,780
They have the same thing with their tracks and everything.

109
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,160
And I didn't know it was even a thing until, like, I think probably was over.

110
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,680
Well, you better believe I'll be blowing shit up on Twitter, pimping on my schedule.

111
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,480
I was hoping there might be something with the video game track, too, but I wasn't reached

112
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,400
out to, which is OK, because I know everything.

113
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,920
I'm not saying like, oh, they should be calling me.

114
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,960
No, everything is crazy this year because it's virtual and they've probably had to come

115
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,160
up with some plan, you know, and I totally understand and I can't wait to see everybody

116
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,260
in person again in 2021, hopefully.

117
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:06,180
But, you know, I am going to be doing the stuff with the digital media track and I'm

118
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,400
excited about that.

119
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,920
And I was reached out to by another track, too, that I've never worked with before and

120
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,720
I really wanted to do it.

121
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,160
But I don't want to say what it was because I don't want to I don't want to sound disrespectful

122
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,800
or anything, because the reality was I didn't know anything about the subject they wanted

123
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,320
me to do.

124
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,480
But it doesn't have to do a gaming, it doesn't have to do a broadcasting.

125
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,020
Think really hard for those of you that listen to orange entree over the years.

126
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,420
There's some other things that I do on the weekend and I haven't done them this year

127
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,580
because of covid.

128
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,580
But think really hard.

129
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,820
You might be able to piece it together and but they were really cool about it.

130
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,640
They were like, oh, thank you for being honest, because, you know, I'm sure there's a lot

131
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,780
of people that are like, oh, sure, I'll just fake it.

132
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,220
I'll fake it and do a good job.

133
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,380
And we don't want to watch that panel where the person is faking it.

134
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,740
So out of respect to the panel, I said I wasn't going to do it.

135
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,680
So all right, S.S.U. 100 Matt in chat says the food track.

136
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,160
I knew it.

137
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,960
I wish there was a food track.

138
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,120
That would be awesome.

139
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,280
I don't think there is a food track now.

140
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,720
There should be a food track.

141
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,920
I mean, there are food trucks that are parked near the convention and they certainly have.

142
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,740
Actually, I will say over the over the seven, eight years, I've literally lost count.

143
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,840
I think this would have been year eight had I gone.

144
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,980
I guess I am going.

145
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,440
I'm going digitally, whatever.

146
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,440
So out of the eight years I've been going to Dragon Con, the first couple of years,

147
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,800
I don't remember them having food so accessible in the hotels.

148
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
But the hotels really wised up.

149
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,020
They got vendors like Papa John's, which say what you will about their pizza.

150
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,820
But when it's drunk and they're close by, you really don't care.

151
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,620
You know, they're there within the hotels.

152
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,740
My absolute favorite thing in the world, this would be the last Dragon Con thing I say and

153
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,420
then we can get into video game news.

154
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:54,760
My absolute favorite thing in the world is the alcohol ice cream.

155
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,640
So they actually sell ice cream that has alcohol in it.

156
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,360
And it's it's outstanding.

157
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,660
And I'm sure Bobby will shout the name of the vendor because I can't remember it off

158
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,760
top my head.

159
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,020
But they started showing up two years ago and they've been there.

160
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,740
And I think it's it's brilliant.

161
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,900
And I love their ice cream.

162
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,060
And it's a great thing to kind of just take down with you.

163
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,540
And I'm just eating ice cream.

164
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,540
Everybody teehee.

165
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,540
Oh, Bobby can't remember their name in the moment either.

166
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,540
Well, that's OK.

167
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,300
This Ben to Dragon Con will know what I'm talking about.

168
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,780
But yeah, stay tuned for Dragon Con.

169
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,780
Speaking of events going virtual, I want to make sure a plug goes out for this and then

170
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,380
we'll get into tonight's kickoff topic.

171
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,580
So Loki, I'll have you take care of the kickoff topic here in a moment.

172
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,040
But Summer Games Done Quick just kicked off today.

173
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:38,040
And I know a lot of you guys watched that event as well as the awesome Games Done Quick

174
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,280
event in January.

175
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
Awesome event.

176
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,940
It's not just a clever name for charity.

177
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,220
They raise a lot of money doing a lot of speed runs.

178
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,420
And usually we're kind of sitting here just kind of like going, oh, what a great event.

179
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,420
We watch it.

180
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,420
We're fans.

181
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,420
We partake.

182
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,420
We might donate if we're able to and so forth.

183
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:58,100
But very little do we actually get involved.

184
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,700
Last year, our voiceover guy, Jason, got involved.

185
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,820
I think it was last year.

186
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,020
Sorry, Jason, if I'm I'm cutting that short, it might have been two years ago.

187
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:11,080
But last year, Jason got involved being doing things on site with the Games Done Quick event.

188
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,080
And that was really cool to hear about.

189
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,120
And I think he came on the show at one point and was talking to us a little bit about that.

190
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,800
This year, VOG Network's own Bobby Blackwolf on Before Us here at the VoiceGeeks Network

191
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,240
is actually going to be one of the hosts, is what they call them, announcers, voiceover

192
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:35,080
folks, while the speed run for Devil May Cry 4 is going on on Wednesday night at 11 o'clock

193
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,080
Eastern, 8 Pacific.

194
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,080
I hope I got that right.

195
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,560
Don't be mad if I'm not.

196
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,080
Bobby Blackwolf is actually going to be the guy that reads donations now and again when

197
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,460
the speed runners ask him to do so.

198
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,000
My understanding is this is a pretty tight speed run.

199
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,840
There's probably not going to be a lot, a lot of donations and so forth that are able

200
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,840
to be read.

201
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,240
But I think it's really cool that Bobby's getting that opportunity to like jump in there

202
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,240
and be in there.

203
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,600
So I know I plan to watch just to support Bobby, but also to support the awesome charity

204
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,140
and the speed runners that really make this event possible.

205
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:16,100
And if you do decide to donate, make sure your donation isn't about VOG Network or Bobby.

206
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,740
We can dish about that over here on Sunday night when it's over.

207
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,760
Make sure your donations about the speed runner or about the charity.

208
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,700
If you want, you can do like host choice.

209
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,980
That's a nice little way to let Bobby have a little bit of power if you want.

210
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,320
But yeah, don't spam chat with VOG Network.

211
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
That's silly.

212
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,920
Don't do that stuff, please.

213
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,420
Please make it about the charity, which is Doctors Without Borders if you hadn't heard.

214
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:43,980
And what a time to do that, because, you know, even though it's looking like we will have

215
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:49,300
a vaccine of some sort in 2021, fingers crossed, toast crossed, et cetera, the news is looking

216
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,860
very good there, right?

217
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:56,180
The reality is, even though our country, the U.S., will get the vaccine, Canada will get

218
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,580
the vaccine, UK, I'm sure, will get the vaccine and so on and so on.

219
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,900
Many industrialized nations around the world will get the vaccine.

220
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,580
COVID is still going to be a thing on our planet because there's going to be a lot of

221
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:13,340
nations that aren't going to be able to get that vaccine for their people as fast.

222
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:18,120
But an organization like Doctors Without Borders can help treat sick people and so forth in

223
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
these countries.

224
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,100
And I mean, they were on the front lines and things like Ebola and SARS and things are

225
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,100
happening too.

226
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,180
So it's a great charity to support because the reality is and all the experts have said

227
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,100
this COVID-19 is not going away.

228
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,500
We're not going to eradicate it from the planet.

229
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,620
Hopefully, fingers, toast crossed, we eradicate it from our nation like Ebola, right?

230
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,260
We don't hear about that anymore, but Ebola is still a thing.

231
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,900
You hear about a breakout now and then in some country and so forth, and that may be

232
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,940
the story for COVID-19.

233
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:54,620
So anyway, Bobby actually says this is the first year that Doctors Without Borders operated

234
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,100
in the U.S.

235
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,540
They were in New York a few months ago.

236
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,100
So during when New York was the epicenter of the COVID thing.

237
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,700
Bobby also says the time is likely to change.

238
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:09,260
It was originally 10 p.m. Eastern, but now it's like 1130 Eastern.

239
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:13,620
And that just happens as you know, I think they had a little tech kick up this morning

240
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,460
and I'm sure some speed runs run longer, shorter, whatever happens there.

241
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,780
So times are fluid.

242
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,500
That's why my brain was going, I'm not sure this is right.

243
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,020
Yeah, because I was hearing a couple of times.

244
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,020
That's why.

245
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,020
All right.

246
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,020
Just check the website.

247
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,020
Look at the schedule there.

248
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,020
Oh, yeah.

249
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,020
Yeah, that's a good way to stay on top of it.

250
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,860
I'm sure Bobby's going to send out a tweet or something.

251
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:40,660
And also our Discord is a great place to be over at vognetwork.com, vognetwork.com slash

252
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,660
Discord.

253
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,980
We'll get you into our Discord server.

254
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,860
That's a great place to be as well.

255
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:51,980
And if you want, I'm pretty sure we'll do this as well as while Bobby is actually doing

256
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,340
the games done quick, we'll probably host it.

257
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,580
I haven't talked to him about this.

258
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:02,960
I don't know if this is a faux pas, but we'll probably host it so that our chat can say

259
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,820
whatever we want about, yay, Bobby and all that stuff in our chat, the VOG network chat.

260
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,820
But I don't know if that might be frowned on because maybe Summer Games wants the viewers.

261
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,820
I don't know.

262
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,860
But as long as they're, as long as y'all are donating that, okay, Bobby says, yes, I was

263
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,860
going to host it.

264
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,860
Phew.

265
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,860
Okay.

266
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,660
So we'll host it on the VOG network channel when he's going.

267
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,660
So that'll be great.

268
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,660
Okay.

269
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,660
Cool.

270
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,660
And they like hosts.

271
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,660
Yay.

272
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,660
Because it is about the charity at the end of the day.

273
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,340
So let's get into some news.

274
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,860
There's some big news that happened this week.

275
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,860
And this is a big one.

276
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:37,780
A lot of people on social media are watching because I think we on social media are being

277
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,700
recruited for this effort.

278
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,700
Aren't we, Loki?

279
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,700
What's going on?

280
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:47,980
Well, of course, because they have to get all the kiddies to, you know, blindly advocate

281
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,980
for them.

282
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:59,420
billionaire company, Epic Games, had made some updates to Fortnite's client in iOS and

283
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,300
Android.

284
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:06,100
And they added a direct payment option that was cheaper on those devices.

285
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:13,500
So what they basically did is surpassed the normally required processes through their

286
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:19,020
respective app stores where both Apple and Google take a cut of that.

287
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,620
That's how they make their money.

288
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:26,660
And so Epic complained about it before and whined about it.

289
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,500
And I think even if I remember correctly, like at one point, they're like, well, we're

290
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:34,300
not even going to put it on the Androids or the Google Play Store because we don't like

291
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,300
that.

292
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,380
So they had their own separate launcher and then it was kind of a pain to get it installed

293
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,660
on your device or like paying for your target audience.

294
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:49,260
I believe throughout all this separate launcher is still there.

295
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:56,740
Yeah, so now they of course, they were integrated into those stores.

296
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:02,220
And so now they added this direct pay option, which definitely goes against the, you know,

297
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,380
rules to be on those storefronts.

298
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:10,460
And so immediately, as they probably expected, because they definitely planned all this,

299
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:17,180
they were booted off of the Epic Games Store, or I'm sorry, off of the iOS store and also

300
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,100
the Google Play Store.

301
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:26,900
And then of course, they put out this ridiculous parody video of like one of the old Apple

302
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:35,780
commercials talk, you know, basically calling, you know, Apple, this very, this controlling

303
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:40,060
entity for their store, which be honest, it's their storefront, they can do whatever they

304
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,060
want.

305
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,060
They can make the rules.

306
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,260
I don't necessarily like that there's an open option, whereas on Android, if you don't want

307
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:51,660
to use the Google Play Store, there's other options, but it's not necessarily as preferable.

308
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,020
And there's stuff you have to do to sideload all that.

309
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,020
Two things.

310
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:02,940
One, the commercial was a direct parody of a 1984 style commercial that Apple did way

311
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,940
back in the day.

312
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,580
I don't know if it was Olympics or Super Bowl or something like that, but it was an ad that

313
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:11,100
they did to try to kind of announce that, you know, Apple was coming and it was coming

314
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,300
for the dominant IBM machines at the time.

315
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,740
Although I seem to recall Commodore 64 was still a thing in 84 and all this other stuff.

316
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:24,260
So my history is a little blurry there, but I know it is a direct parody of an Apple Macintosh

317
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,540
commercial, like shot for shot.

318
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,620
Like Bobby had a whole side by side on his show that went, I didn't realize how close

319
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,800
to the original it really was until he played that shot for shot.

320
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:39,740
But number two, I must admit, I expected you to come out guns a blazing on Epic's side

321
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,040
with this.

322
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
But you definitely-

323
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,460
Oh, I'm not going to take the side of a billionaire company, I'm sorry.

324
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,660
I'm just a little, I'm a little surprised, but I'm pleasantly surprised.

325
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:54,980
Why should they get, why should they get an exception to the rule when all the other

326
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,540
smaller developers have to pay that same fee?

327
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,540
I'm sorry.

328
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,440
No big company don't get special treatment.

329
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,380
So you know, I think it's stupid.

330
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,280
But anyways, they're of course filing a lawsuit against those two companies, which is already

331
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,280
drawn up.

332
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,140
So obviously all this was already planned out.

333
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,140
And of course at the same time, they also have a hashtag that they want you to go on

334
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:21,260
social media and complain to Apple and Google that, oh, we need to go our launcher away.

335
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,740
I mean, it's absolutely ridiculous.

336
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,860
First off, please don't do that.

337
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:31,180
I mean, I would respect our listeners enough to know that they're smart enough to know

338
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,380
not to advocate for corporations.

339
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:40,620
You don't need to advocate for a company that is literally, they're literally fighting over

340
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,180
money when they make billions and billions and billions of dollars, and they will continue

341
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,860
to make billions and billions and billions of dollars after all this is done too.

342
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,180
Please do not feel the need to advocate for them.

343
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,180
They are big boys.

344
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,540
They can handle themselves.

345
00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:01,940
So it's just ridiculous to try to throw some bad press away just to try to get their way.

346
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,940
What's Epic doing?

347
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,940
They're not playing fair either.

348
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,180
I mean, they're the ones they're paying for exclusives and stuff on their platform to

349
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,180
try to get people to go to the Epic game store.

350
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,420
Yeah, they're offering a discount for developers that go on there.

351
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,420
That's great.

352
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,420
If you want to take that, cool.

353
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,380
But they're also not playing fair with other things.

354
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:23,980
So it's ridiculous to think that they're like some white knight of the gaming industry.

355
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,980
They're not.

356
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,800
And I just think this whole thing is ridiculous.

357
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,140
I'm a little stunned because I find I pretty much agree with Loki and I don't have a lot

358
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,140
to add.

359
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,900
This is a pleasant change.

360
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,700
I mean, I know y'all like the debate and you tune in for that.

361
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,040
But yeah, that I here's the thing.

362
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,820
I don't consider that I'm like completely against Epic in this situation.

363
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:53,700
I do understand some of the concerns, but don't think for a minute that Epic isn't trying

364
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,700
to weaponize social media for their own purposes.

365
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,220
And I think that is shady shade.

366
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:07,940
That is, it's really, and it's transparent as fuck because they had that commercial ready

367
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,220
to go.

368
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,340
They strong arm this move ready to go.

369
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,700
They had that legal paperwork ready to go.

370
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,940
This was a calculated plan.

371
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,940
For what?

372
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,940
I'm going to tell you what.

373
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,940
You know what else is ready to go?

374
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,620
The Epic game store on iOS.

375
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:31,060
Mark my words, timestamp this episode because if Epic wins this legal thing and Apple has

376
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:36,240
to allow like other competing stores or whatever on because it's part of, it's part of, it's

377
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,300
not as much in the big thing, but they do reference it like the having the game store

378
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,300
or whatever.

379
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:46,340
If this whole, if the courts end up signing with Epic, Epic will have their own game store

380
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,300
up on iOS the next day.

381
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,300
Why?

382
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,980
Because they want to undercut Apple.

383
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,860
And anything, and also, and even if you, and I understand there's people that are very,

384
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,960
very pro Apple.

385
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,120
There's people that are very, very anti Apple, but anything I'm saying Apple in this case

386
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,940
also applies to Google.

387
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,680
They are one in this, in this case, they are one in the same.

388
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,400
There are other things about those stores that are very much, not the same like the

389
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,520
cloud gaming, but with this, this particular Fortnite case, it's really the same thing

390
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,760
on both sides.

391
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:24,440
So if, if the courts end up siding with Epic the next day, the Epic game store is going

392
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,760
to be available on iOS.

393
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,200
The Epic game store is going to be available on Google play.

394
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,480
And the Epic game store is going to immediately undercut that 30% fee.

395
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,200
That's going to be the very first thing that they do.

396
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
Okay, fine.

397
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,680
I understand competition's good, but you know what Epic's going to do?

398
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,600
They can go ahead and do that already though.

399
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,800
They can literally build their own storefront on Android and just put it out there.

400
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,840
Granted, you have to sideload it into your device, but they could literally do that.

401
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,560
That, I mean, look at the, um, you know, they have the Amazon storefront for awhile, the

402
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:56,800
Amazon app store and not as popular, but I mean, it's definitely, it's a thing that

403
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
they could do.

404
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
I, I don't understand.

405
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,160
They could already go ahead and do that.

406
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:06,840
It's just, they want to have like their launcher available on the Google play store and they

407
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,240
also want to not pay the fee.

408
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,240
I'm sorry.

409
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,200
You can't be on a store.

410
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,000
You have to play by the rules, you know, in order to be on their storefront.

411
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,560
That's just the way it is.

412
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,920
And so if you don't play by the rules and you can't be on there, I'm telling you, this

413
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,560
is what's going to happen next after that.

414
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:28,120
Because what is the other big thing in Epic's pocket right now is that they, they run a

415
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,640
massively popular engine to write video games in.

416
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:39,680
So how easy is it going to be for them to, in their own game publishing system, one touch

417
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,060
published to the Epic game store on mobile devices.

418
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:47,880
And now that game is available in their game store, but there'll be some type of exclusivity

419
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,880
agreement or whatever the financial situation, whatever's going to be better.

420
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,260
Who's who's now, who's got the dominating part of the market.

421
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,280
Now who's trying to control it.

422
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,060
And I'm telling you, this is Epic's big plan.

423
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,640
I am telling you, this is what they want.

424
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,260
And I don't even have to sit in the boardroom to know this.

425
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:11,400
So I can understand why people want to needle Apple and Google on the way some of their

426
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,240
stores are locked down.

427
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,320
And especially like the cloud gaming thing, which I do think Google and Apple are going

428
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,720
to need to, well, Google already has, I'm sorry, Apple needs to relent on the cloud

429
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,840
gaming thing a little bit.

430
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,680
They're going to need to treat the cloud gaming like Netflix, like Spotify, like Twitch.

431
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,040
They don't, they don't moderate all of the content here.

432
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,600
If you're watching on your iOS device, this stream right now, Apple didn't review it.

433
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
You know what I mean?

434
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,520
And I think they're going to have to take that same approach with games.

435
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,100
So I'm not saying like, oh gosh, the stores are perfect in this particular scenario, but

436
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:51,660
I do not see this as Epic fighting for the consumer, fighting for the little guy, fighting

437
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,880
for a freer store.

438
00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:00,280
Epic wants a freer market that they can take advantage of, period.

439
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,280
That's what they do.

440
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,280
Right, exactly.

441
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,560
Just like, just like all of the stuff that they did in, you know, to make things better

442
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,000
against Steam really hasn't really done anything.

443
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,920
All it's done is some games are now free on Epic store once a month and, and some games

444
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,080
are only exclusively through the Epic store.

445
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,400
And I now have to use two different launchers to play some games.

446
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,760
Like I don't notice like it, they didn't change the industry.

447
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,760
Sorry.

448
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,240
You're not big enough to do that.

449
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,280
You throw your money around and it's your exclusives.

450
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,360
That doesn't, that's not because people wanted to come to your storefront, it's because you

451
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,360
paid for it.

452
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,420
And it's whatever, let, let them fight.

453
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:47,260
I also feel that if Epic wants to be more competitive, maybe they should like fix their

454
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,120
own damn store first.

455
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,320
Like cause their store is still an inferior product on PC.

456
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,320
Sorry.

457
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,920
I said it, said it.

458
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:00,160
And that's my opinion, but, and I use the Epic game store, hell yeah, I cash in on those

459
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:05,400
free games, but the Epic game store is the only place that I've been hacked.

460
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,320
That didn't happen to me on Steam.

461
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,640
The Epic game store still doesn't have achievements.

462
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,440
The Epic game store is still missing the ability to pay with preloaded cards.

463
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,840
You know, there's still a lot of places where the Epic game store is really lagging behind.

464
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,360
So there's a part of me that's like, why don't you use your resources to fix your own damn

465
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,140
house first?

466
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,720
Then you can, you know, kind of take on this other stuff.

467
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,760
I don't know, but, and I want to be clear because I don't want to completely sound like

468
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,080
I'm like a hundred percent pro the Apple and Google side of things.

469
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:42,800
Because I do think Apple especially is, and I'm an Apple user, look, look, if you're on

470
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,960
the Twitch feed right now, what do I have in my, I have Apple earbuds in my phone right

471
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,960
now.

472
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,960
Okay.

473
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,960
There's a lot of Apple products I love.

474
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,880
But I do think they're going a bit far with like the cloud gaming stuff.

475
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,760
Like I said before, like if all this other stuff exists, why shouldn't video games be

476
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,660
able to be streamed through the cloud and so forth?

477
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:04,700
And I do think there needs to be a better kind of line drawn with, you know what, if

478
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,620
you sell a product directly on your site, then whatever.

479
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,660
But if you're selling it through the store, then yes, we get to have a cut.

480
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:17,820
And my examples would be Spotify, Netflix, CBS, all of those things, you can go buy on

481
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,220
the website.

482
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,420
And I think, especially with Twitch, I think is a great example too, you can buy them on

483
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:27,820
the website or you can buy them through the app, but you know what Twitch doesn't do?

484
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,620
And they're more expensive if you buy them in the app, of course, because you know, they're

485
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:35,700
having to pay for Apple's cut and they're passing that cost on to you.

486
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,780
But what they don't do is they don't have a big old pop up that comes up and says, you

487
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:44,620
can get these bits cheaper if you go directly to our website by clicking here and going

488
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,620
to do that.

489
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,480
And I do kind of see where there's probably going to have to be a line drawn there where

490
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:56,500
there can't be like a click here to be instantly taken out of the store and go around that

491
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,780
30% fee.

492
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,820
I think it's going to have to be one of those things where, OK, if you do it on the website,

493
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,820
then whatever.

494
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:05,820
But if you do it from within the store, something from the store, then it's got to have that

495
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,980
30% fee.

496
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,700
And I would be OK with that, quite honestly.

497
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,620
Like I think that's what Epic should be happy with as well.

498
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:17,140
Like if they sell the thing on their own storefront, then whatever.

499
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,380
And that's because you brought the purchase to them.

500
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,500
I don't know.

501
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:26,440
And I don't see them trying to burn the bridges with Microsoft and Sony as well, or even in

502
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,560
Nintendo with their storefronts, because they all take a cut as well.

503
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:34,480
I'm sure that's where the majority of their gamers are, that and PC.

504
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:41,040
So, of course, these being a smaller market share on Android and iOS devices.

505
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,680
That's probably why they're risking it there.

506
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,440
But they sure as heck aren't going to do it at the other places because that would just

507
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,440
destroy them.

508
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,280
SSJ 100 Matt says, it's an ugly pinch fight between billionaires.

509
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,680
We're the losers because we have to watch it.

510
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,960
I don't know what a win looks like in this scenario.

511
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,240
You know, again, if Epic comes out victorious in this whole thing, I'm not sure the confetti

512
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,520
cannons should be readied, because what is that really going to mean?

513
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,920
I just, you know, I'm pretty sure they're not the first company to sue Apple because

514
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,000
they don't have an open storefront to allow other.

515
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,840
I'm almost positive Spotify or Amazon has an Amazon sued them.

516
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,320
I'm pretty sure maybe that was over the term app store.

517
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:30,920
But I'm pretty sure that there's other companies that have sued them to try to get this opened

518
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:36,280
up for other companies to have their own individual storefronts, but doesn't seem to have worked

519
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,280
so far.

520
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,720
I mean, I don't know if they think it's sure throw money at the problem, I guess, but Questbuster

521
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:47,040
in chat says, as a side note, last year, Spotify filed an antitrust complaint against Apple,

522
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,020
which is now part of the EU's ongoing investigation.

523
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,660
They also mentioned the 30% cut, which they call attacks.

524
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,660
There is that.

525
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,720
I want to read a couple other comments here.

526
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
This is important too.

527
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,900
VG Realness in chat says, fuck Apple, fuck Google, and fuck Epic.

528
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,440
I'm thinking of that scene.

529
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,760
And sorry, it's going to be a Drag Race reference, Loki, but I'm thinking that scene from Untucked

530
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,300
in season 12, where Heidi Ann Closet gets up and goes, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you,

531
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,300
and fuck you.

532
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,600
That's what VG Realness is doing right now.

533
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,320
Fuck Apple, fuck Google, and fuck Epic.

534
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,320
Rich.

535
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,320
Yeah.

536
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,080
Was that like, I can't remember which movie it was like, fuck you, fuck you.

537
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,800
You're cool.

538
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,120
I think that was, I think that was this movie about waiters waiting or something like that.

539
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,760
Anyway, I need to read the rest of the comment is very important.

540
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,760
I need to read it.

541
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,500
And VG Realness says, fuck Apple, fuck Google, fuck Epic.

542
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,320
Rich companies whining and complaining to be more rich, making us fight their battles.

543
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,800
Meanwhile, the cops who killed Breonna Taylor are still free.

544
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,940
My point, there are bigger issues in life at the moment.

545
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,460
Absolutely a hundred percent true.

546
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:58,040
It is disgusting that there have been no charges brought up against the cops who murdered Breonna

547
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,600
Taylor.

548
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:08,360
However, games sometimes, I think we can still separate that games and gaming and video games

549
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:13,000
also kind of exist to give us an escape of all these shitty things that are going on

550
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,360
in the real world.

551
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:18,640
That doesn't mean to ignore it, to be ignorant of it or forget it.

552
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,400
But for example, I know with this whole COVID-19 and in quarantine and being isolated, staying

553
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,360
at home and all this stuff, you know, I've been battling quarantine related depression

554
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,060
things and video games are a really good escape from all that.

555
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:40,680
At the end of the day, I can also see the point where it's like, fuck all of these companies.

556
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,440
They're all in it for themselves.

557
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,440
They win.

558
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,440
News.

559
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,360
What the fuck ever happens, happens.

560
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,040
I totally get that perspective and it's honestly kind of like where my head is at.

561
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:57,060
However, I think it is kind of worth looking at what is that going to look like if Epic

562
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:01,440
wins this and now the Epic Game Store is something that's available on iOS.

563
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,300
Is that something that interests you?

564
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,740
And my answer is hell no, because the Epic Game Store doesn't really interest me on the

565
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:11,320
PC right now outside of the free games and all the fucking exclusives that they get,

566
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,840
which kind of forced me to buy certain things on their store, which I really don't like

567
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,960
doing.

568
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,160
I've bought one game on their store and it's Tetris Effect.

569
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:23,580
So anyway, let's see.

570
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:28,080
Run John Stomp, excuse me, in chat says, I don't care what happens to Fortnite.

571
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,000
I just want Epic Games to push Apple to change some rules because that means cloud gaming

572
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,680
has a better chance of happening on my iPad.

573
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,860
And again, I'm with you where I think that's the rule that needs to change.

574
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:44,220
But my gut kind of tells me it will, because it did for Netflix.

575
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,920
It did for Spotify.

576
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,300
It did for that email app that was recently in the news.

577
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,300
What was it?

578
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,940
Hey, you're someone I'm sorry, I forget the name, but some some email app went to battle

579
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,400
with Apple on that, too.

580
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,600
And I think ultimately, that's where this ends up, too.

581
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:01,220
I think the cloud gaming apps will happen on iOS.

582
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,700
Am I being stupidly optimistic?

583
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,700
Maybe.

584
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,100
But I just kind of think the track record is there.

585
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:10,060
But I do think the storefront and who gets the 30% cut and so forth will end up being

586
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,060
a different issue.

587
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:15,940
Let's see.

588
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,280
Let's see.

589
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:22,580
Bobby Black Wolf says, I platinumed Persona 5 Royal after 124 hours to battle quarantine

590
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,580
depression.

591
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,640
Note, I do not actually have medical depression, which is a real thing.

592
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,380
I'm just depressed as an emotion.

593
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,420
Yeah, same.

594
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,380
I'm not saying I was diagnosed or anything like that.

595
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,380
I'm not here to belittle.

596
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,700
You all know what I mean.

597
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:39,420
We've all got the feels during these events and so forth and video games can be a great

598
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,820
escape for that.

599
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:44,900
But again, don't be ignorant to everything else going on in the world.

600
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,900
Y'all better be.

601
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,540
Y'all better be figuring out how you're going to vote in the US.

602
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,820
Y'all better figure out how you can be voting in November, because it sounds like they're

603
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,060
going to try to make it as difficult as possible.

604
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:58,460
So I'd care a little bit more if they said, oh, hey, we're just trying to earn some additional

605
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:03,260
money so we can donate that all to the US Postal Service to keep that thing afloat.

606
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:06,220
But yeah, it's just going in their pockets.

607
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,340
Well fucking said, to be honest.

608
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,340
All right.

609
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,340
Yes.

610
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:14,060
If Epic said, you know what, we're doing this because we want to donate the extra money

611
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:18,380
to the US Postal Service, I think this we would be having a completely different discussion

612
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,380
right now.

613
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,380
But they're not.

614
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,940
They're going to be having discussions like you can't get changed just by, you know, pissing

615
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,360
somebody off and then filing a lawsuit about it.

616
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,020
You need to like just partner with these guys and like have a discussion about what you

617
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,200
want to do.

618
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,060
Maybe they've tried that and it hasn't gone their way.

619
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:42,780
But like, I don't think at the end of this, I mean, like with on the Google side of things,

620
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:49,580
because we've been focusing a lot on Apple, but like, I don't know, not that I'm saying

621
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:57,500
that it would be advantageous for them to, for Epic to try to get say Fortnite on, I

622
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,580
don't know, Stadia.

623
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:05,340
But like if that was something that they were thinking about doing, I think that kind of

624
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,860
burned their bridge there with that.

625
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,860
I don't know.

626
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:14,820
It's just, it seems kind of silly that this may not work out for them.

627
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,060
It might not.

628
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,220
And I think one other thing I want to make sure we say before we get into our gaming

629
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,180
weeks on this whole topic, because I can't totally speak for Loki, but I have an idea.

630
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:28,540
This is where his head is at on this as well, is that if it sounds like we're really irritated

631
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:34,380
with Epic in this whole situation, like it's not necessarily the fact that they're pushing

632
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,180
back on Apple's rules because people are always doing it.

633
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:41,820
Like I said, and when it comes to the cloud gaming issues, Spotify has done it, Netflix

634
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:46,120
has done it, or cloud based services issue, Netflix has done it, et cetera, et cetera.

635
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,360
Like it's not the fact that they're making a legal issue out of it or whatever.

636
00:33:50,360 --> 00:34:04,400
It's the fucking propaganda and how they're trying to weaponize gamers, which are not

637
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:09,160
usually the most pleasant crowd on social media to begin with.

638
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:14,280
And I think gamers on social media, and I'm not talking about the vast majority of people

639
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,400
that listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because you guys have been really cool in your comments,

640
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:26,560
but I think y'all know when you go into very large gaming chat rooms and you watch events

641
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:32,300
and you see things on social media, you see a lot of negativity, you see a lot of anger,

642
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,360
you see a lot of bullshit.

643
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:40,700
And I think that's what's really irritating about this is that Epic is trying to weaponize

644
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,760
that bullshit.

645
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,940
And that's the part where I'm just like, this is so transparent.

646
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:52,940
I'm like, I'm offended almost, almost.

647
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:59,180
So would be, I mean, not, not the judge people, but I would assume like a lot of the Fortnite

648
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,640
players out there are probably younger.

649
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,200
Do they, do they know what 1984 is?

650
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,920
Do they even know who George Orwell is?

651
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,880
Are they still forced to read that in high school?

652
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,880
I don't know.

653
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:18,320
Cause I can't imagine like, you know, when you're asking them on retaliation of, you

654
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,640
know, was Epic Games to defy the App Store monopoly.

655
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,880
Okay, dude, come on.

656
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:29,680
And is this going to fight the top 20, 20 from becoming 1984, dude, if they were talking

657
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:35,620
about like, you know, Facebook and you know, all these other like social media platforms

658
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:40,280
tracking your, your movements and stuff like that, I might be more on board.

659
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:45,760
But like, because you can't get a few extra percentage points out of, you know, your App

660
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,760
Store purchases.

661
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,760
I'm sorry.

662
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,120
That's not quite the same.

663
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,400
Oh, Big Brother.

664
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,520
I love that show.

665
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:02,960
Stan Janelle, SSJ100 Matt says, ask the people dealing with crunch time working on Fortnite

666
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,080
how much this matters to them.

667
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,080
Yeah.

668
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,080
Yeah.

669
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,280
How many, how many crunch hours did it take to put up that trailer?

670
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,280
That's it.

671
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,280
That's it.

672
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,280
Just, just like that.

673
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,760
Just leave that and leave the room.

674
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,760
That's all you need.

675
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,000
That's, that was fucking great.

676
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
All right.

677
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,920
Uh, let's, let's get into other gaming news and talk.

678
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,880
We'll see where this goes, but since it's legal, it's not going to go anywhere fast.

679
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,880
That's for sure.

680
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,880
So we'll move on.

681
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,360
Let's talk about other things like how was our gaming week and what are the types of

682
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,280
video games that we have been playing this week?

683
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,440
Ricky, how was your gaming week?

684
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,200
So, um, I played a few things this week, so I played a whole ton of Orna because I took

685
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,060
a road trip down to the Bay area this week, um, to go visit my grandparents.

686
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:53,840
So, uh, I wasn't driving the car this time, so I got to try to capture all of the territories

687
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,840
between here and Santa Clara.

688
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,680
Um, so it was great.

689
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:05,960
I like a few hundred, uh, probably like 150 to 200 new explored territories, um, because

690
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,880
Orna unlike, you know, like Pokemon Go and Ingress and stuff will let you play quite

691
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,360
a bit when the car is moving.

692
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,360
So it's, it worked out great.

693
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:20,880
Uh, so I did that and then, um, I played a little bit, uh, my kids actually made me play

694
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:26,840
a bit of, um, Paper Mario and the Origami King cause I had to do boss fights and stuff.

695
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,760
So I got to play against the second boss, which is great.

696
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,960
And um, what else?

697
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,080
I think I played a little bit of Minecraft this week.

698
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:40,440
Um, I've been doing like kind of game dev tutorials, um, most of the week.

699
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,440
That's what I've been working on.

700
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,680
Uh, so a little, a little different than the usual stuff I've been messing with.

701
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:52,160
I, um, took up some new programs and stuff to learn those, but yeah, that's pretty much

702
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,160
it.

703
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,160
All right.

704
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,560
My gaming week.

705
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,160
So I've been playing a lot of the same old stables, um, still playing Final Fantasy

706
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,520
14, a brand new content patch was released this week.

707
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:08,120
The big, uh, update we've been waiting for 5.3 just came out that actually kind of bookends

708
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,780
the Shadowbringers expansion story.

709
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:15,120
This patch was delayed a little bit because of COVID, um, I guess Square in Japan had

710
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,040
some difficulty with transitioning to the work at home thing.

711
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,240
Um, it just set them behind schedule a little bit.

712
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,080
So this patch has been a long time coming.

713
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,840
Uh, but it showed up this week and it's, it's really good.

714
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:29,800
Like from a story perspective, it's really, really good and really cements the Shadowbringers

715
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:35,440
story and really all of the Final Fantasy 14 expansions as just one of the best JRPG

716
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,000
stories that's out there right now.

717
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,480
Now of course there's that whole problem about the monthly fee and I understand that's what

718
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,080
turns people off to it.

719
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:47,200
The good news is though, for what it's worth, um, this patch did also make the free to play

720
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,720
experience a lot more robust.

721
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,800
You can now play the first two, and there's four all together Final Fantasy 14 expansions,

722
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,680
you can play the first two for free.

723
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,280
They let you go all the way to level 60 and basically everything with Heaven's Word you

724
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,460
can do for free.

725
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:05,960
Now you can't really join free companies, you can't do things that they're worried about

726
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,880
guild sellers, explore, um, gold sellers, whatever, exploiting free accounts.

727
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,240
There's still, a lot of that is still shut off and so, you know, obviously the other

728
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,920
day they want to make money, uh, but there's still an awful lot you can do for free.

729
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:23,840
However, I'm hearing that like, if you played A Realm Were Born and then you stopped, I'm

730
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:27,800
hearing some of those people are having a real hard time coming back for the free to

731
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,800
play thing.

732
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,480
I don't know all the ins and outs of how that works, or what have you, I'm just hearing

733
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,920
it's a little bit headachy.

734
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,040
But for people that have not played 14 at all, there is that opportunity and Heaven's

735
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,820
Word was a great story, so I think it's pretty cool.

736
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:48,300
But yeah, I really enjoyed the latest patch, obviously I'm not going to spoil anything,

737
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,700
but I thought it really wrapped everything up very nicely, it was very movie-like and

738
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,020
very well done.

739
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:59,460
So um, yeah, kudos to the Final Fantasy 14 team, they're continuing to develop a phenomenal

740
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,220
game, that's for sure.

741
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:06,140
Other games I've been playing this week, still the same old GPS stuff, like Pokemon Go, I

742
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:12,180
have done so much remote raiding in Pokemon Go, I'm almost embarrassed to say how many

743
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:17,420
of those stupid coins I've spent on remote raid passes, well, it's not a crazy amount,

744
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:23,020
but it's a few, trying to get like a shiny Genesect, and I still don't have one.

745
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:28,500
I did like another five fights today, I get a lot of like random invites, I'm very lucky,

746
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,460
and I've been taking them up on some of them, like if I see them pop up in time, I'll try

747
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:37,500
to join in, and if I have the pass, I'll join in and do the remote raid, but I love what

748
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,560
remote raiding's done to the game.

749
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:45,280
This made it a lot easier to get a group together to do a fight, and I hope it stays long past

750
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,400
this COVID thing, and I think it's going to, I think they're going to cap how many people

751
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,000
can do it, but you should still be able to get a minimal group together to take down

752
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,160
any raid boss with those remote raid passes, and I think that's going to be a really good

753
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,160
thing.

754
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,040
So, very cool.

755
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:04,960
Sorry, I'm backtracking a little bit, but this is very important, Bobby in chat says,

756
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:18,680
See, that's, that's dumb on Square's part, and World of Warcraft doesn't do that, theirs

757
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:26,120
is a little bit stronger in that regard, so, I would say the two things holding Final Fantasy

758
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:32,120
XIV back right now, their archaic storefront, and this is an example of that, and their

759
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:37,000
archaic server structure, which WoW is ahead of them in that regard.

760
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,040
Those are the two, like, negative things I'll say about Final Fantasy XIV that I really

761
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,800
would like to see them work on.

762
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,880
Love the game, love the product, they really need to work on those two things.

763
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,580
The dumb storefront, and the dumb server structure that doesn't make me, doesn't let me play

764
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:56,280
with my friends in the US because they picked it at different data center.

765
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,760
Like we're past that, WoW has shown that.

766
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:04,080
SHG100Matt says, Rob sent me a raid invite last night, it was close to midnight here

767
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,920
on the east coast, so yeah, remote raid is great.

768
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,880
Yeah, you can do the, I got a raid invite in Germany today, that I was doing at like

769
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,040
10am, so that was kind of fun.

770
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:18,200
And it's neat because if you catch the Pokemon it shows, well actually no, my geotags disappeared

771
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:23,120
but it used to show, like this Genesect is from Germany or whatever, so it's kind of

772
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:27,040
fun catching them all from around the world thanks to remote passes.

773
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,320
The other game I've been playing this week, Fall Guys, which you know, it's free on

774
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,600
PlayStation Plus, free with gold, and it's also available on Steam.

775
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:40,820
Alan has really gotten into Fall Guys on Steam, and I played a little bit on PlayStation 4,

776
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:44,540
and I think it's great because it's that whole battle royale thing but it's not a

777
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,540
shooty shooty bang bang.

778
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:49,560
Oh yeah, that was the other thing, I forgot I played Fall Guys this week as well, that

779
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,360
was something I played quite a bit of as well.

780
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,360
Oh yeah?

781
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,020
What do you think of Fall Guys?

782
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:57,580
It's alright, sometimes it can be a little bit frustrating with the controls, but overall

783
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,620
it's been pretty decent.

784
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:03,900
I just wish the controls are a little bit tighter so that it's not so much like I'm

785
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:08,900
falling over, I mean I get it, Fall Guys ha, but like I wish it wasn't that I was falling

786
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:15,060
over all the time, you know, more skill based, like I can actually be able to run this stuff

787
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:20,540
a little bit easier, but I mean it is what it is, it's fine.

788
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,540
It's pretty fun.

789
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,780
Anyway, I don't want to duplicate myself too much because I'm pretty sure I talked about

790
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:28,700
this game last week because I remember saying this game when it comes out on the Switch

791
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:33,380
is going to be the game, and I think that's just a matter of time when that happens and

792
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:37,900
I still stand by that, but Fall Guys is fun for sure, so.

793
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:42,340
No One Special 77 in chat says, seems like every Tom, Dick, and Harry plus their long

794
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:47,460
dead granny, that's quite a mouthful, is streaming Fall Guys on Twitch, from what I've seen it

795
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:50,020
looks like Mario-less party.

796
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:53,780
Well, Fall Guys also, if I'm not mistaken, they did a kind of campaign with some of the

797
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:59,780
big streamers on Twitch to kind of bump themselves up in the rankings, but a lot of games do

798
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:03,280
that and not all of them catch on, this one caught on.

799
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,020
And I think it's just part of, I like the fact, you can play it in short, quick little

800
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:12,760
matches, short little bursts, you can play it with friends, and I think it makes it an

801
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:17,180
attractive game to stream, probably because it's very easy to understand what's going

802
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,180
on.

803
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:23,660
I don't always like to watch narrative streams being streamed on Twitch, and I stream a lot

804
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:28,020
less of them myself, I'm not gonna say I'm never gonna do it, but I would probably always

805
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,180
stream the beginning of it, I probably wouldn't stream midway, because I don't like to jump

806
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:34,920
into a game like watching somebody do Paper Mario, I have a lot of friends that are streaming

807
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,580
Paper Mario, I don't want to see the game halfway through, because A, it's kind of like

808
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:42,500
spoiling part of the story, B, all the mechanics have already been explained and sometimes

809
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:46,620
it's hard to understand what's going on, Fall Guys, it's very easy to understand what's

810
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:47,940
going on.

811
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:54,060
And I think that's what makes it really lucrative to stream, for sure.

812
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:58,220
Pele Hanumea in chat says, I got my pineapple costume in Fall Guys, so I'm good.

813
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:02,380
Yeah, some of the costumes are really funny, so I need to play more to get costumes.

814
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:06,180
Alan, have you got any costumes in Fall Guys?

815
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:10,580
I'm waiting to see what he says from the other room.

816
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:14,060
He says as you play, you level up, even if you don't win.

817
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:18,000
As you play, you level up, even if you don't win, and you just unlock stuff.

818
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,260
So have you unlocked anything cool?

819
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,860
He says, he's thinking, I got like a dinosaur.

820
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:27,780
A dinosaur, okay, that's cool.

821
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:31,900
Act Def says, there's an Enter the Gungeon costume right now on PlayStation 4.

822
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,900
Nice.

823
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:40,180
Yeah, and they're also doing a Team Fortress 2 skin as well, so I think the Scout.

824
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,180
I think you're right.

825
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:45,860
Anyway, that was pretty much it for my gaming week, so had fun there.

826
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:48,260
I want to go out and do Orna and all that stuff too.

827
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,260
It's too hot.

828
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,440
I haven't played Ingress in the past two days just because of the weather.

829
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,940
It's too much, and I'm at the point where I'm like, if the other team is going to field

830
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:02,020
right now, I can't be bothered.

831
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:07,060
They want it more if they're going to play in this heat, because it is insane right now.

832
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:08,500
And that's kind of where I'm at with Pokemon Go.

833
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:14,220
They did the Pokemon Go Community Day Makeup, or sorry, Pokemon Go Fest Makeup was today.

834
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,180
I didn't go outside for that, hell no.

835
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:22,780
But I did Incense on the couch, and I didn't catch anything that spectacular, but I tried.

836
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,780
But I wasn't going to go outside and play.

837
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,260
It's too hot.

838
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,260
It's still hot.

839
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:32,220
My watch says it is still 105 degrees outside, and it's not even 7 o'clock.

840
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,820
This is Phoenix-style weather going on right here.

841
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,180
All right, anyhow, let's move on.

842
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:39,960
Let's get into some news, some other things going on in the gaming world.

843
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,020
So Loki, why don't you start us off?

844
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:47,260
The Xbox Series X is going to be coming out later this year, so we know now which month.

845
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:50,300
That's going to be November.

846
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,820
Now one thing that is from November.

847
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:56,020
Did we ever doubt that it wasn't going to be November?

848
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:58,020
It could have been October.

849
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:02,640
All right, all right, all right.

850
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:08,520
So anyways, it's going to be coming out, but Sans Halo Infinite, unfortunately Halo Infinite

851
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:16,760
has been delayed to 2021, I'm sure partially because of the reactions to the gameplay trailer

852
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:21,920
that they had that were less than preferred.

853
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,740
But they did say that there's going to be 50 new games that are playing to launch this

854
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:31,600
year across generations, and they'll be optimized for Xbox Series X.

855
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:38,300
And also, I think they said a total of 1,000 games across four generations of consoles.

856
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:41,720
So lots of stuff with Game Pass and all that.

857
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,000
So we'll see.

858
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,320
I'm excited about it, but Halo Infinite not coming out, it's not a deal breaker for me.

859
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:53,980
I'm not a huge Halo fan, but I would prefer that they polish it so it doesn't look like

860
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:54,980
it did.

861
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:55,980
Yeah.

862
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:58,140
I already kind of made my thoughts on Halo known.

863
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:59,520
I am a Halo fan.

864
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,280
I've maybe fallen out of favor a little bit.

865
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,180
Like it's kind of lost me a little bit with some of the newer titles, but I was a fan

866
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:08,460
of the fact that they're going for a more classic looking Halo game.

867
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:12,520
I'm enticed by the fact it sounds like they might put a battle royale, because I think

868
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,520
the multiplayer in Halo is a lot of fun, even if I suck at it.

869
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,160
I think a battle royale type mode could be a lot of fun.

870
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,160
Note that that was never before.

871
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,000
With the battle royale type mode that's in it, it's like Fall Guys.

872
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Yeah.

873
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,220
Well, we'll see.

874
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:27,420
There's some mechanic-y things in Halo too sometimes.

875
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,420
So we'll see.

876
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,060
At the end of the day, if the game's not ready, it's not ready.

877
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:35,260
And for whatever reason they pushed it back, then yeah, push it back.

878
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,580
Take the time you need.

879
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,820
Still, it's a pretty shocking delay.

880
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:42,820
I mean, that is like Nintendo pushing back a Mario game for launch or something.

881
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:46,060
It's a huge title.

882
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,400
Didn't they do that though?

883
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,380
Was Mario Odyssey originally supposed to be a launch title or is that not?

884
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,380
Maybe.

885
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:53,380
I don't know.

886
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,380
Maybe.

887
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:55,380
You're probably right.

888
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,380
Maybe.

889
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,380
But they did have the Zelda.

890
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:02,060
Although the Zelda came out on two systems, they really only advertised it for one.

891
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:04,060
The Breath of the Wild.

892
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:07,740
Assuming that Mario Odyssey was delayed, does anyone remember?

893
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:08,740
No.

894
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:12,060
Same thing when the Xbox Series X came out.

895
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:15,780
Once it comes out, no one's going to remember that it was delayed or going to care.

896
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:21,660
But it was supposed to be like a big thing to get a Series X for, so I do hope Microsoft

897
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:27,260
has a long game plan or that they are adjusting their expectations for the holiday sales of

898
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:30,100
the Series X accordingly.

899
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:33,740
Maybe this is a blessing in disguise if there's going to be hardware manufacturing issues,

900
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:36,060
although we haven't heard a lot about that or anything.

901
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,300
So I mean, we'll see.

902
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:44,100
But I'm kind of curious to see what Xbox Series X is going to look like in that launch window.

903
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,820
Although I'm not going to lie, I'm probably still going to get one.

904
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:47,820
Yeah.

905
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:50,060
I mean, it's fine there.

906
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,300
Hopefully there'll be other things.

907
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,260
I know Games Pass will help.

908
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:54,260
This is exactly it.

909
00:49:54,460 --> 00:50:00,580
Removing the cost of, say, Xbox Live Gold might even help more, but all in good time.

910
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,580
All those announcements.

911
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:02,580
We don't even know what cost yet.

912
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:05,900
Yeah, because you might ask me, why are you going to get an Xbox Series X?

913
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:08,700
The answer is Game Pass.

914
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,640
Because there'll already be a ton of games to play.

915
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,060
And then I'm not going to be able to get it through the iOS store because the launcher's

916
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:18,900
been taken down, and how am I going to buy my console then?

917
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,020
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, Animal Crossing was delayed.

918
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:22,220
Smash Brothers was delayed.

919
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,420
SJ100Matt says, Metroid Prime 4 was pushed.

920
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:27,380
Yes, yes, and yes, none of those games launch titles.

921
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:28,380
So that's the only thing.

922
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,260
And I'm not saying I'm mad or anything.

923
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:33,420
No, again, if they need to take the time to get it right, take time to get it right.

924
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:37,700
But it's just interesting what's that going to do when that was the big anchor title I

925
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:41,340
kind of thought as far as launching the system.

926
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:46,020
It's just going to be interesting, and I hope Microsoft lowers their expectations accordingly.

927
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:52,500
I would hate to see Microsoft write the Xbox Series X Office a failure when Halo wasn't

928
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,180
there ready to go day one, and maybe it'll still do very well.

929
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,180
I don't know.

930
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:57,180
But we'll see.

931
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:04,220
But I also think, again, if a lot of the strength of Microsoft can be measured in Game Pass,

932
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:08,480
and how much of that they push on PC, and how much of that they push on console, whatever

933
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,100
it is, I do think Microsoft will still make a lot of wins there.

934
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:17,180
Microsoft has that flight simulator coming out this week, and that's going to be a big

935
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:19,420
win for Game Pass, in my opinion, too.

936
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:23,540
And I think a good reason to get Game Pass, because why pay all that money for a flight

937
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:28,700
simulator when you, I think, isn't PC Game Pass like five bucks a month?

938
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,180
Like it's pretty cheap.

939
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:34,700
Don't know, because I think when you buy the one now, you get both.

940
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:37,380
So I'm not sure if, maybe it's Games Pass Ultimate.

941
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:38,380
I don't know.

942
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:43,260
But yeah, I know it's less expensive, because there's less games available.

943
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:50,500
I kind of wish that if I bought the PC one, I could stream all my Xbox games to the PC,

944
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:54,020
since there's not all of them.

945
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:57,860
That would definitely sell me one.

946
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:02,420
S-H-O 100 Matt says, I would like to think anyone coming out with new tech in 2020 has

947
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,420
expectations tempered.

948
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,420
At least they should.

949
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,420
True.

950
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:10,020
Hani Hanumea says, total respect to Microsoft for courage to delay Halo.

951
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:13,340
That's a really well said point, although isn't courage an Apple word?

952
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:14,340
I'm just kidding.

953
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,340
I had to.

954
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,340
Cheap shot.

955
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,340
I had to take it.

956
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:21,860
V.G. Realness says, not sure if it was already stated, but what is Sony really launching

957
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:26,300
with anyways, besides Miles Morales, which is also PlayStation 4?

958
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:29,700
That is a damn good question, and we don't know.

959
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,240
And that is one that Sony, I think, should answer as well.

960
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:37,200
So it could be very interesting that on both sides of the house, Microsoft and Sony, we

961
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:45,640
might see, I don't want to say weak lineups, but maybe lineups different than what we've

962
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,920
seen in the past.

963
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:53,160
But I think we're also going to see a big lenience, especially on Microsoft's side,

964
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:58,800
of play the games you already know the best on this new system.

965
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,420
And I think that's going to be a huge part of Microsoft's messaging since PlayStation

966
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:06,040
still not talking about backwards compatibility, really.

967
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,040
We don't know.

968
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,600
But a lot can change in the next month.

969
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:13,560
But I think big moves are going to have to start happening this month.

970
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,880
It's mid-August.

971
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:20,280
So I really I would have thought before Labor Day was kind of like the deadline for Sony

972
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:24,540
and Microsoft to lay bare what is the launch day going to look like.

973
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:26,440
But maybe they're going to cut it closer.

974
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,440
I don't know.

975
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:33,280
And to invoke Apple, Apple can do a huge fucking event and be like, there's a brand new phone

976
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,420
in three days and it'll still sell cuckoo bananas.

977
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:41,160
So that might not be a good idea in the state of our postal.

978
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:47,800
Well, not necessarily the post office, but like even UPS and FedEx and all of those companies

979
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,920
are very backlogged as far as what's being delivered.

980
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,640
Perhaps not the best time to hold off your preorders, you know, or like even shipments

981
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,640
for that stuff.

982
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:02,920
In fact, we had a recent story that one of the UPS facilities in California was putting

983
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,140
things in the pile instead of delivering them.

984
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:08,920
So I don't know.

985
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,880
I would rather we know the information sooner than later, but I know that they're waiting.

986
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,840
They want to counter Sony on that stuff.

987
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:21,120
And once again, billion dollar companies fighting over billions of dollars.

988
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:25,520
VG Realness and chat says it seems like both launches are going to be lackluster.

989
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:29,880
They should just both delay and call it a day since they can't seem to pick a date and

990
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:35,320
price playing this bullshit capped cat and mouse game.

991
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,600
And that's shown under Matt piggybacks off that to say something similar to what you

992
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,640
just said.

993
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:45,060
And again, another situation where two companies are playing chicken about announcing the price.

994
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:47,880
We consumers are stuck in the middle of it.

995
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:53,320
So here we just why don't let's let's bring Sony and Microsoft into the room.

996
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,320
Okay, walk in.

997
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,320
Okay.

998
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,320
Fuck you.

999
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,320
Fuck you.

1000
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,320
Fuck you.

1001
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,320
Fuck you.

1002
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:03,840
Well, also playing cat and mouse with the price of a system during the nation's greatest

1003
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,760
recession in history.

1004
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,480
I mean, or what's going to be probably the greatest recession.

1005
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:13,920
Yeah, I don't think technically the recession hasn't hit levels of like, let's say the 1930s

1006
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:19,840
or the the last one we had in the aughts, but at the time of this thing, yeah, fair.

1007
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:20,840
All right.

1008
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,220
Let's move on, shall we?

1009
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:26,260
Let's talk about a game you're not going to be able to buy on the new console.

1010
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:29,060
And that is Forza Horizon 3.

1011
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:33,740
Forza Horizon 3 is being moved to an end of life status, meaning it will no longer be

1012
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:36,120
on sale after September.

1013
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,660
So Forza Horizon 3 came out in 2016.

1014
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:41,660
It's done very well critically.

1015
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:42,860
And it's a good fucking game.

1016
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:43,860
I own it.

1017
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:44,860
I'm a fan.

1018
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,860
I love the Forza Horizon series.

1019
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:52,300
I think it's one of Microsoft's strongest titles, especially when it comes to exclusives.

1020
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:57,740
I can't fucking wait until they announce Forza 5 for the Xbox Series X, because it seems

1021
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:59,620
like that will happen eventually.

1022
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:00,620
But of course, you have this whole...

1023
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:01,620
Horizon 5.

1024
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:02,620
What's that?

1025
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:03,620
Did I say...

1026
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:04,620
Forza Horizon 5.

1027
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:05,620
You know what I meant.

1028
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:08,320
Forza Horizon 5 for the Series X.

1029
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,980
But of course, we have this whole interesting thing now where that same studio did so fucking

1030
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:15,100
well with Forza Horizon, now they're doing Fable.

1031
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:18,820
So you know, now I might kind of have to wait a little bit.

1032
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:22,340
But anyway, Forza Horizon 3 not going to be available anymore.

1033
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:25,360
And this is likely due to licensing agreements.

1034
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:28,060
They do have music that plays during the game and so forth.

1035
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:33,660
And sometimes, as opposed to patching it out, it's just easier to not sell it anymore.

1036
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:40,240
The same thing happened to Forza Horizon 2, by the way, which was an Xbox One launch title.

1037
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:47,040
If memory serves me right, I believe it was released on the 360 and the Xbox One, that

1038
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,040
same holiday.

1039
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:51,000
And that was delisted in 2018.

1040
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,520
And that's interesting, because that would be the same timeframe.

1041
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,960
That would be, what, about four years since launch.

1042
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:00,640
So whatever licensing agreements or whatever was in place must expire.

1043
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:09,040
So Horizon 3, no longer available in September 27.

1044
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,520
That means all of the DLC as well.

1045
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:15,880
So if you want to get things like that hot, was it the Hot Wheels was in three?

1046
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,460
Hot Wheels is in three, Lego is in four, right?

1047
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:19,960
So yeah.

1048
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:24,600
So if you want to get that stuff, you got to get it because it's going to be going away.

1049
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:28,400
What I think is interesting about this, now games get delisted all the time.

1050
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,280
We don't necessarily see a first party game getting delisted.

1051
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,560
Oh, by the way, if you already own the game, you're going to be fine.

1052
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:38,240
If you need to re-download it because you own it, you're fine.

1053
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:42,860
If you have a disc version, you're buying it used to GameStop or whatever, you're fine.

1054
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:47,720
It's just you can no longer buy a new copy on the marketplace.

1055
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:51,680
But I think what's interesting about this is that I would have considered the Horizon

1056
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:55,200
series one of the great things about Game Pass.

1057
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,840
And so it is interesting because I've always just assumed, oh, Game Pass is just going

1058
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,820
to have all the first person Microsoft titles.

1059
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:04,740
But sometimes those titles are going to get sunsetted.

1060
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:06,860
And not everything first party is available yet.

1061
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:13,220
And maybe some of the tricky licensing agreements are part of the reason why.

1062
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:18,600
Now for what it's worth, Forza Horizon 2, I distinctly remember was a games with gold

1063
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,180
game right before it went away.

1064
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:23,340
So a lot of people had a chance to grab it.

1065
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:27,940
And so hopefully they'll do the same thing with Horizon 3 next month.

1066
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:31,820
It's going to have to be next month because it goes away at the end of September.

1067
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:32,820
But we'll see.

1068
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:33,820
They haven't announced that yet.

1069
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:35,100
But it is a sale.

1070
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:39,940
You can get it like 67% off, which I think, what, like $9.99 or something like that is

1071
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:40,940
the price of the game right now.

1072
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:41,940
It's pretty cheap.

1073
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:43,940
It's a damn good racing game again.

1074
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:48,260
If you haven't tried the Horizon series, give it a go.

1075
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:49,420
It's not a simulator.

1076
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:52,680
It's an arcade style racer and it works very well.

1077
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,380
So I'm a big fan.

1078
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:57,300
So check that out.

1079
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,300
Let's move on with our next story.

1080
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:59,300
Loki.

1081
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:07,180
Alright, so we talked a little bit about Xbox and PlayStation both getting a lot of games

1082
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:10,700
that are being upgraded to next gen for free.

1083
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:16,700
So unfortunately, one of these games that's not going to necessarily be upgraded is Control.

1084
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:21,780
So Control, the original game, came out quite a while ago.

1085
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:27,780
And now what they're doing instead is they're only going to be upgrading the ultimate edition

1086
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:28,780
of Control.

1087
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:32,300
So in order to get that, you have to pay $40.

1088
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:37,140
It's basically kind of the sort of game of the year edition of Control with the DLC thrown

1089
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:38,140
in there.

1090
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:42,380
But it's going to, that version will be upgraded, but not the original version.

1091
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:45,980
So not only people that paid full price for that are getting a little bit penalized, especially

1092
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:50,260
if you bought the DLC for it as well, but in order to get it to play on the PlayStation

1093
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:56,020
5 or Xbox Series X, you have to purchase it again for $40, which is kind of ridiculous.

1094
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:58,020
I'm not sure why they would do that.

1095
00:59:58,460 --> 00:59:59,980
That's the choice that they made.

1096
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:00,980
Yeah.

1097
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:05,180
I mean, it really depends how much they're putting into it because, you know, like take

1098
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,300
a game like Saints Row the Third, right?

1099
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:11,100
They just recently did that whole new remaster and you didn't get it for free, right?

1100
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:16,260
You had to rebuy the game, but you got a remastered product.

1101
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:17,460
It looks a lot different.

1102
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:20,060
It looks a lot cleaner and so forth.

1103
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:22,260
So some would argue it's worth it.

1104
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:27,420
So if they're going to be taking the type of time to make those same type of changes

1105
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:30,220
to control, then maybe it's a little more justified.

1106
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:35,220
But if it's just like, oh, it's just a port for PlayStation 5, then blah, you know?

1107
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:36,220
Yeah.

1108
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:45,100
But I mean, to argue, basically, if you're making the assets for one version of control,

1109
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:49,940
it's really not going to cost you any more to upgrade both versions.

1110
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:52,900
I mean, that would be the logical sense is, hey, you know what?

1111
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:56,860
We're going to be upgrading this so that you can play it on the next gen consoles.

1112
01:00:56,860 --> 01:01:00,220
And on top of that, if you haven't purchased it yet, you can get it for 40 bucks.

1113
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:01,660
It's at a discount.

1114
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:06,100
That would make them kind of out to be like the good guys here, you know, offering a pretty

1115
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:10,140
decent deal for those who might be excited to get into that now that we've seen, you

1116
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:12,740
know, some next gen footage of it or something.

1117
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:16,700
But instead, they're paywalling it to try to I don't see how that's going to really

1118
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:21,060
get people that own the original version of control to like, oh, well, I better jump on

1119
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:22,060
that.

1120
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:25,260
I mean, that's kind of ridiculous.

1121
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:26,700
They can definitely do that.

1122
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:31,140
I don't think it's a good decision, but I think really they should do both versions

1123
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:32,900
that they're going to make the assets for it.

1124
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:37,180
They're not changing the engine it's running in and it's the same game just with the DLC

1125
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:38,180
thrown in.

1126
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:41,580
So you're making the assets for this version to be upgraded anyways.

1127
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:43,180
Why can't you do both?

1128
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:47,620
I honestly feel like control will be one of those things and this not to shade a game

1129
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:51,480
that honestly I haven't played and I need to because the studio always does make really

1130
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:54,540
good games and control obviously got some very good reviews.

1131
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:55,920
It's like on my list.

1132
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,820
You know what this news tells me?

1133
01:01:57,820 --> 01:01:59,380
This news says up, stop.

1134
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:00,420
Don't bother with it now.

1135
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:04,080
Wait for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X at this point because you're wasting your time

1136
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,080
doing it now.

1137
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,240
Or how about this?

1138
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,240
You know what?

1139
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:10,920
Oh, you want to you want me to pay another $40 for the ultimate edition?

1140
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:11,920
No, thank you.

1141
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,660
I'll just wait for it to go down to $5 or $19.99.

1142
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:19,180
That was exactly what I was going to say is that I feel like control on PS5 and Xbox Series

1143
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:25,000
X is going to be one of those things 90 days and it'll be half off if that 90 days out

1144
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,640
and it'll be half off.

1145
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:27,640
Just wait for sale.

1146
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:30,200
I mean, I'm sorry.

1147
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,920
It seems like double dipping.

1148
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,140
I just don't get it.

1149
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:38,080
It would be different if this was to your example of Saints Row.

1150
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:40,480
Saints Row was a game that came out on PlayStation 3.

1151
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:45,360
They remastered everything for the PlayStation 4 version and they put it on other systems

1152
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,360
as well.

1153
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:50,400
So they went in, they had to redo the whole engine, they had to upgrade all the visuals.

1154
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,480
That's different than say we're adding some additional features to make it look nicer

1155
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,640
on the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5.

1156
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:00,840
They're not rebuilding the whole game from the ground up, I think.

1157
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:06,460
But at the same time, there have been other things like Bioshock, that series.

1158
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:12,000
I want to say that they did free updates, remastered editions, if you will, for those

1159
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,640
who already bought the original ones.

1160
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:16,960
They didn't want to punish those people, but at the same time, they were also selling that

1161
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,860
on its own.

1162
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:20,600
You know what y'all better be ready for?

1163
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,240
You know what y'all better be ready for?

1164
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,000
The same thing's going to happen with Final Fantasy 7 Remake.

1165
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Mark my words.

1166
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,160
It's going to happen with Final Fantasy 7 Remake.

1167
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,400
It's not going to be a free upgrade, they're going to do a new.

1168
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:35,280
And it'll all be timed with the exclusive window lapsing for PlayStation.

1169
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,200
So there will be an Xbox Series X release, a PlayStation 5 release.

1170
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,720
I almost said Nintendo Switch, but no.

1171
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:44,720
So there'll be a PlayStation 5 and maybe a PC, I don't know.

1172
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:50,320
But there'll be a release on all those platforms and it'll be some type of Uber edition that

1173
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,720
has like an extra.

1174
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,800
Maybe Red 13 will be playable.

1175
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:55,800
I don't know.

1176
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,500
But they're going to do like an extra something something to be like, oh, it's got something

1177
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:05,480
new and make people buy it again in anticipation for when the second part of the remake story

1178
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:08,240
comes out whenever that ends up being.

1179
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:11,240
But I'm telling you, it's going to happen.

1180
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,240
And that's fine.

1181
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,240
I don't know.

1182
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:14,240
I just.

1183
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,240
It's whatever.

1184
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,320
I mean, you know, vote with your wallet.

1185
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:22,960
So if you think it's reasonable to purchase the original game and you really, really,

1186
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:27,240
really want to get it, you know, for the next gen system, maybe you didn't buy the DLC for

1187
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,240
it.

1188
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,240
I mean, then fine.

1189
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,240
Repurchase the game.

1190
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,480
But like, if I wouldn't, I would just wait.

1191
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:38,360
I would seriously, especially if you if you have already purchased the game, then you

1192
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:42,400
don't need to run out and purchase the game right away just to play it on another console.

1193
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,120
I'm assuming you probably have already played through the game as it is.

1194
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:50,420
And at that point, just wait, just go back and play the original version again.

1195
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:55,880
Then again, you're talking to somebody who bought Mass Effect three, four times and is

1196
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,800
about ready to do a fifth time as soon as they announce that.

1197
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:01,000
But it wasn't on the same console, though.

1198
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
That wasn't the same.

1199
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
It wasn't the same console.

1200
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,960
I mean, I don't know.

1201
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,480
It's just silly.

1202
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,480
It is silly.

1203
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:14,720
But once again, it is we're in a capitalist society, so we can go ahead and they can do

1204
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,120
whatever decisions they want.

1205
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:19,040
And if we support it with our wallets and they'll continue to do that, if you don't

1206
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,280
like it, then don't buy it.

1207
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,520
I only paid full price for it once.

1208
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:23,520
Let's be clear.

1209
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,520
All right.

1210
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,120
Anyway, let's move on.

1211
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:28,900
Let's talk about someone that's not going to be getting full price.

1212
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:32,000
That is going to be the executives at EA.

1213
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:39,200
So what happened is that investors actually voted down a proposal for EA to pay their

1214
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,200
executives.

1215
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:44,240
It's interesting because EA is not having a bad year, notably.

1216
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:47,480
Video games are performing relatively strongly, and that includes EA.

1217
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:51,980
I mean, it might not be like Nintendo level strong, but EA is performing strongly due

1218
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:54,340
to the coronavirus and everything that's going on.

1219
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:56,520
More people are staying home and playing video games.

1220
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:00,360
Apex Legends is doing very well and so on and so on.

1221
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:06,720
However, investors cast one hundred and seventy one million votes against an EA executive

1222
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:07,880
pay package.

1223
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:11,560
Apparently sixty million votes were in favor.

1224
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:12,560
That's kind of interesting.

1225
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:16,760
I guess some of the issue that happened was that EA was rewarding executives with secondary

1226
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:21,000
stock awards before the first ones had been vested.

1227
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,680
So that wasn't a whole issue as well.

1228
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:30,960
EA apparently went to per CTW Investment Group said EA went, quote, too far in terms of executive

1229
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:37,760
pay, piling on exorbitant equity awards while paying multimillion dollar bonuses following

1230
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,320
worker layoffs.

1231
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:43,400
And that's talking about what happened with EA Melbourne fire monkeys.

1232
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:47,320
So very interesting.

1233
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:52,840
To put some of this like to put some money numbers on this, the chief technology officer

1234
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:59,460
Kenneth Moss and chief financial officer Blake Jorgensen get six hundred and ninety

1235
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:05,120
one thousand dollars in change and eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year each.

1236
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:12,240
But they also get these equity grants worth seven point five million and five point five

1237
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,240
million.

1238
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:16,240
That's a lot of money.

1239
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:19,200
How are they going to live without all that extra money?

1240
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,800
I mean, like, oh, they're going to what are we going to fill the money pit with?

1241
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,920
That's potentially homeless at that point.

1242
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:25,920
So anyway.

1243
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:26,920
Yeah.

1244
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:33,560
So EA responded to Bloomberg Financial magazine saying the board and compensation committee

1245
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:38,560
will take their feedback into account as part of our ongoing evaluation of our compensation

1246
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:39,560
programs.

1247
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:44,220
So finally, people are stepping up and saying maybe you're making too much fucking money.

1248
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:50,200
So that's kind of interesting, especially I do like that it's called out that like,

1249
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:54,080
you can't fucking lay off all these people in Melbourne and then take these gigantic

1250
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:55,080
packages.

1251
01:07:55,080 --> 01:08:01,080
That's Activision's job.

1252
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:05,600
And what's interesting is that that's coming from the investors of EA, not within EA.

1253
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:11,440
So SSJ 100 Matt says they will have to settle for a twenty twenty Ferrari instead of a twenty

1254
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:14,520
twenty one.

1255
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:18,920
Phoenix seventy seven twenty six says they can't get their third boat.

1256
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:21,520
Four babies.

1257
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,960
All right.

1258
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,160
Phoenix seventy seven twenty six says I'm already eating the rich.

1259
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,880
I can't handle any more.

1260
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:30,880
All right.

1261
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:31,880
Let's move on.

1262
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:35,840
Loki, speaking of some executive shuffling, right?

1263
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:36,840
Yes.

1264
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:45,560
So we first have Assassin's Creed creative director who has been let go of the company.

1265
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:53,440
Basraf Ismail, he stepped down from his role in June after being accused of pursuing extramarital

1266
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:57,500
relationships with women under false pretense because, you know, Ubisoft was having a lot

1267
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:00,580
of these issues come up recently.

1268
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:07,400
So of course, he has left the company because of the investigation to his misconduct, which

1269
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:12,560
apparently they've found out that they're somebody that was warranted, I guess.

1270
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,200
They said following investigation by an external firm.

1271
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:19,680
It was determined that Ashraf's employment with Ubisoft had to be terminated.

1272
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:20,680
So basically.

1273
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:21,680
Yeah.

1274
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,840
You know, all those things that people were saying that was happening at Ubisoft.

1275
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:24,840
Yeah.

1276
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,240
They were happening in Ubisoft.

1277
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:33,680
So I expect that this won't be the last that we'll hear of people leaving that company

1278
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:41,840
and completely other news, though, and not related to sexual misconduct allegations.

1279
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:49,040
Laslo Jones, who is one of the developers or the minds behind, is to say the Grand Theft

1280
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,160
Auto series since Grand Theft Auto three.

1281
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:55,520
He also plays a fictional version of himself, kind of like almost like a Howard Stern type

1282
01:09:55,520 --> 01:10:02,160
character on the in-game radios within the series as well.

1283
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:08,480
He's actually left the company as of back in April, and he's actually left to go work

1284
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,440
on some different projects as well.

1285
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:17,520
So he's, I believe, gone to Netflix and are developing shows for both Netflix and Disney,

1286
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,400
as well as doing consulting work for video game companies.

1287
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,760
So that's more of a positive note.

1288
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:31,840
But yeah, it's nice to hear people actually going leaving because of opportunity growth

1289
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:32,840
opportunities.

1290
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:33,840
Yes.

1291
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,240
Instead of being shown the door.

1292
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,680
Yes, exactly.

1293
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:38,680
Yes.

1294
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:41,080
That individual needed to be shown the door.

1295
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:46,200
So I'm glad to hear Ubisoft is taking the steps they need to take that we all kind of

1296
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,200
saw coming.

1297
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:48,200
So that's good.

1298
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,600
But yeah, these are kind of this is a weird pairing to put together.

1299
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:55,440
Sorry, but it's, you know, it's executive changes at companies, I suppose.

1300
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,520
But yeah, it'll be interesting to see what Laslo is going to be working on, especially

1301
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:01,600
with that, you know, kind of resume Grand Theft Auto four or five.

1302
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,320
These are huge games that made buku bucks.

1303
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:07,260
Could it be a Grand Theft Auto game for Netflix?

1304
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:08,260
Probably not.

1305
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:10,980
Maybe something that that feels like it.

1306
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:14,380
He's just probably I mean, because it's a really huge game series.

1307
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:19,140
I mean, so I can imagine that, you know, he has a lot of industry knowledge as well.

1308
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:24,300
And maybe if they whenever at this point, like I'm not holding my breath or anything,

1309
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:28,440
they do a Grand Theft Auto six at some point when you when they're tired of rereleasing

1310
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:33,740
Grand Theft Auto five for the millionth time, then maybe they'll have him back as a guest

1311
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:36,640
DJ again to, you know, reprise his role.

1312
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,360
But we'll see.

1313
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:43,720
Or or his cousin, Laszlo will take over.

1314
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:44,720
Who knows?

1315
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:45,720
All right.

1316
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:46,720
Yeah.

1317
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:47,720
Anyway.

1318
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:48,720
All right.

1319
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:49,720
Let's move on.

1320
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:53,000
We're going to go to the classic game of the week.

1321
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,920
So every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and

1322
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:01,100
finds a game that she thinks, hey, you brats out there on the Internet, you should be playing

1323
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:02,100
this game.

1324
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:03,940
Dark Sakura sadly is not here tonight.

1325
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:06,080
She will be back with us next week.

1326
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,940
So tonight I have picked a game for us.

1327
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:12,280
But, Loki, I would say, pay attention, because I really tried to pick a game tonight.

1328
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:15,360
And I think you will very much approve of my selection tonight.

1329
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:19,200
And you don't even know what it is yet, because I made a boo boo on the show role.

1330
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,800
So I'll give you a hint, Loki.

1331
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:25,440
This is a game we have talked about like a million times on this show.

1332
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:30,160
And somehow it has never been a classic game of the week, like a lot of things can be a

1333
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:31,160
lot of games.

1334
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:34,000
This game inspired other games.

1335
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,920
And I think one of them was a classic game of the week not that long ago.

1336
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:40,440
And that was probably the last time this game came up.

1337
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:47,200
This is a game that I used to play in my junior high school PC lab on lunch, where my friends

1338
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,200
and I were trying to kill each other with nukes.

1339
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:56,600
Oh, I have a feeling I know what it is.

1340
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:57,600
All right.

1341
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,360
Well, if you guessed scorched earth, you're oops, that's the wrong.

1342
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:01,360
Sorry.

1343
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:02,360
Oh, darn it.

1344
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:03,360
Sorry.

1345
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:04,720
That was the wrong footage.

1346
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:05,720
My bad.

1347
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:06,720
That does not look like scorched earth.

1348
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:07,720
That was not scorched earth.

1349
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:08,720
That is something else.

1350
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:09,720
Yep.

1351
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:10,720
Yep.

1352
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:11,720
Yep.

1353
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:12,720
We'll talk about that.

1354
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:13,840
I just spoiled something big.

1355
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:14,840
That's coming up later.

1356
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:16,120
We'll talk about that later.

1357
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,360
I fucking love live, don't you?

1358
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:19,360
Let's try this instead.

1359
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:20,360
There we go.

1360
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:21,360
There's scorched earth.

1361
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,160
I hit the wrong goddamn thing.

1362
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:24,160
All right.

1363
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,160
All right.

1364
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:26,160
There you go.

1365
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,600
Scorched earth is the classic game of the week.

1366
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:35,160
So scorched earth is a game that came out for good old MS-DOS in 1991.

1367
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:40,420
So the developer of this game was a guy named Wendell Hicken, and that's it.

1368
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:46,220
It was him because, you know, back in the old days of gaming, games were created by

1369
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:48,100
one person.

1370
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:49,420
And this is an example of that.

1371
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:54,820
So this game was released shareware, meaning that you basically got the entire fucking

1372
01:13:54,820 --> 01:14:00,420
game for free, but it just asked you to kindly pay him money, which I bet very few people

1373
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:01,420
did.

1374
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:02,420
But actually, Logie, didn't you pay for this?

1375
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:04,940
I thought this was one of the ones you said you did.

1376
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,500
I think I don't remember.

1377
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:07,500
It was so long ago.

1378
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:10,060
I most likely did.

1379
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:13,780
I thought that it wasn't the shareware version, then they have some weapons locked or something

1380
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:14,780
like that.

1381
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:15,780
That might have been the case.

1382
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:20,140
I think some weapons, I think some of the field generation and things like that looked

1383
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:21,660
a little different and so forth.

1384
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:26,860
So there is all of that too.

1385
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:31,260
So anyhow, Scorched Earth is a turn-based artillery game.

1386
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:34,260
So again, it's very similar to like Worms.

1387
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:38,940
Worms came after this, and Worms was very inspired by a game like this.

1388
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:41,420
Tank Wars would be another example of an early game.

1389
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:45,580
I almost went with that, but Tank Wars and Scorched Earth are really cut from the same

1390
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:49,420
cloth and they're almost interchangeable, almost.

1391
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:52,860
It's all about the angle and the power.

1392
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:57,120
And you use that to shoot your weapon and see what happens.

1393
01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:00,900
And you can notice if you're watching on Twitch, you can see that these tanks, I think there's

1394
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:05,300
one human player and there's like nine fake computer players.

1395
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:08,100
And you'll notice they're all trying to kill each other by lobbing these weapons at each

1396
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:09,100
other.

1397
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:11,420
But the human player can actually change their weapons.

1398
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:16,020
So I think they're firing now like a slightly bigger missile than the baby missiles the

1399
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:17,860
others are firing off.

1400
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:20,460
So obviously the goal is to kill the other tanks.

1401
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:26,060
But as you fire your weapon, you're also changing the environment, which is a good lesson about

1402
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:30,460
war is that the more you fire off nukes, the more mountains you're going to destroy.

1403
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:33,940
So there is certainly that as well.

1404
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:38,280
Scorched Earth referred to itself as the mother of all games.

1405
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:39,780
Do you know where this comes from?

1406
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:42,740
It's because this game was released in 1991.

1407
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:45,140
That's when the Gulf War was going on.

1408
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:49,620
That was after Saddam Hussein said to the U.S. if they walked on Iraqi soil, it would

1409
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:52,540
be the mother of all battles.

1410
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:55,540
So that's where the name the mother of all games came from.

1411
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:58,340
I never knew that until I logged onto Wikipedia.

1412
01:15:58,340 --> 01:15:59,900
How about that?

1413
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:02,740
Anyway, there's also environmental issues.

1414
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:06,420
For example, the stage they're playing on now, I believe meteors will randomly fall

1415
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:07,540
or it's the lightning bolts.

1416
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:11,560
One of the two will randomly fall and could affect tanks destroying.

1417
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:14,460
Tanks blowing up could do different things.

1418
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:18,940
Some of them do like elaborate firework shows that will kill everything.

1419
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:22,100
Some of them just do a little like poop and it's gone.

1420
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:26,100
Or I think the beam up happens like when I was looking at this before the show.

1421
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:28,580
Like there's two or three different ones that just beam up.

1422
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:32,020
So they kind of like dig into the soil and then they just beam up out of the stress.

1423
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:34,300
It doesn't really hurt other people.

1424
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:39,740
But yeah, and sometimes seeing the elaborate ways that tanks would die is what made this

1425
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:40,740
game worth playing.

1426
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:41,740
Right, Loki?

1427
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:46,460
Yeah, I like also being able to earn money between rounds and you get to purchase weapons

1428
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:47,460
with that.

1429
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:48,460
Yes.

1430
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:54,460
And apparently you can edit the configuration files, TOC 1 CFG and TOC 2 CFG.

1431
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:58,340
You can edit those configuration files so that the tanks say whatever you want them

1432
01:16:58,340 --> 01:16:59,340
to say.

1433
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:01,980
Yes, you can.

1434
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:04,020
Loki is very aware with this.

1435
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:09,140
Anyways, there's all sorts of weapons and there's shields and things get crazy.

1436
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:13,940
And again, if you've seen Worms, Worms was very inspired by a game like this, so you

1437
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:15,740
kind of know where it's going.

1438
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:19,300
But we need to pay respect to the games that came before it, which Squirt's Earth is a

1439
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:20,860
great example of.

1440
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:24,820
You can play this with up to 10 players, so that could either be live people or computer

1441
01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:25,860
controlled people.

1442
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:29,480
So like I said, sometimes we would eat lunch in the science classroom where there were

1443
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:33,020
some PCs and there would be like five of us and the teacher didn't care.

1444
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:36,920
He thought it was great that we he looked at it as we were learning and we weren't getting

1445
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:37,920
into trouble.

1446
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:41,320
He loved it that we would come in his class and play these games, you know, because it's

1447
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:42,700
not like they're that violent.

1448
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:45,920
I mean, sure, the tanks explode, but it's not like you see burning bodies and things

1449
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:46,920
like that.

1450
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:48,940
It's pretty tame, all things considered.

1451
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:54,320
The last version of the game, 1.5, was released in 1995.

1452
01:17:54,320 --> 01:18:00,420
You can actually download this game right now on the official site Wiccan.com.

1453
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:03,840
That's W-H-I-C-K-E-N dot com.

1454
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:07,500
And if you're willing to kick back a donation, he kind of has to pay what you want for like

1455
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:11,780
an all encompassing package that allows you to modify the game to your heart's content

1456
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:13,100
and all of that as well.

1457
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:14,920
So I think that's pretty cool.

1458
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:17,540
So yeah, there it is.

1459
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:21,380
Your classic game of the week is scorched earth.

1460
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:27,080
Other games inspired by this, not just worms, but things like atomic tanks, nasty armored

1461
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:33,820
tanks of war, X scorch, scorch tanks, scorch 3D, whole lot of games that were inspired

1462
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:35,760
by scorched earth and again, worms.

1463
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:38,420
I think that's the one that everybody kind of knows is worms.

1464
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:44,120
So I'm telling you, Tommy Tallarico, they need to get this on the Amico.

1465
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:48,360
I mean, that's a, that's a game seller or console seller right there.

1466
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:50,980
Do you think, I mean, this seems like the type of thing that could be pretty easily

1467
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:52,820
adaptable for the Amico.

1468
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:58,440
I mean, if you, if you say in television Amico three times into the mirror, Tommy Tallarico

1469
01:18:58,440 --> 01:18:59,900
will show up and send you a tweet.

1470
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:02,120
So please elaborate.

1471
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:03,120
Yeah.

1472
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:07,120
All right.

1473
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:10,140
That's going to do it for your classic game of the week.

1474
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:11,140
So let's go back.

1475
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:14,920
And of course my chat room just froze up anyway.

1476
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:15,920
That's all right.

1477
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:16,920
We'll get back into some other news.

1478
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:19,560
So why don't we get into some rapid fire news, Loki?

1479
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:20,560
Yeah.

1480
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:25,640
So there's a whole bunch of interesting mods that are on some of these games that were

1481
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:31,040
on the switch or in this case, the Wii U so breath of the wild, of course, lots of mods

1482
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:37,520
for that because the emulation on PC is so good right now.

1483
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:41,360
And one of the mods that's actually been made is incredibly elaborate.

1484
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:51,120
So there's a mod developer Wai Kuteru who put out a mod that adds an entire race track

1485
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:55,380
from Mario Kart 8.

1486
01:19:55,380 --> 01:20:01,980
So Luigi's, it looks like Luigi's race track and you can actually race if they made a mini

1487
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:02,980
game out of it.

1488
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:08,740
So you race the entire track on the master cycle while these obstacles kind of prevent

1489
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:10,880
you from finishing the race.

1490
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:16,020
So there's like a giant boulders, flame spouts, all sorts of things.

1491
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:20,820
And you're supposed to race around the track to get a good time.

1492
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:25,780
This is insane, the amount of effort that would have taken to put Luigi circuit in there.

1493
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:33,660
But yeah, that's apparently a thing that people can do on these emulation devices to be able

1494
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:36,020
to mod games in such crazy ways like this.

1495
01:20:36,020 --> 01:20:39,660
So I'm not sure where you can check this out.

1496
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:46,660
I just know that they showed it on his YouTube channel, but apparently you can, I'm sure

1497
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:50,620
you can get, oh, he has it through his Patreon so you can acquire it through there.

1498
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:53,460
I'm assuming if you're a backer.

1499
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:57,060
And then this is a game I would love to see come back.

1500
01:20:57,060 --> 01:21:03,180
So apparently Scott Pilgrim vs. the World of course was delisted a long time ago back in

1501
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:11,420
2014, but apparently there's talks now that the creator Brian Lee O'Malley has been in

1502
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:17,620
contact with Ubisoft and apparently they're going to try to work out some deal with Universal

1503
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:21,460
Pictures to maybe bring the game back to modern consoles.

1504
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:22,460
Yeah, he put out a tweet.

1505
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:24,020
He put out a tweet about that.

1506
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:28,180
Like it, like it was for, for a while it was like Ubisoft isn't calling, Ubisoft isn't

1507
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:29,180
calling.

1508
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:31,180
And then he put out a tweet this week that was like, they called.

1509
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:36,500
Yeah, it was PS Ubisoft has reached out to me.

1510
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,900
I mean, I would love for that to come back.

1511
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:41,980
It was such a great game.

1512
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:44,260
Such great artwork in there as well.

1513
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:47,260
I would, I would love to see that.

1514
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:50,340
Yeah, I'd be really excited to see that too.

1515
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:53,460
And you know, the movie is having all this anniversary stuff going on because it's been,

1516
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:57,020
I can't believe it's been 10 years since that movie came out, but it has, I know, right.

1517
01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:59,460
We all just felt our age right there.

1518
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:03,380
But you know, there's like new soundtrack coming out because like the actual film version

1519
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:06,580
of that song that Brie Larson sings is finally going to be out.

1520
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:09,940
And I know a lot of people are very excited about that.

1521
01:22:09,940 --> 01:22:13,340
And then they had like a big zoom thing or something.

1522
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:14,340
I don't know.

1523
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:17,220
But like a lot of the cast did like stuff recently.

1524
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:20,580
And you know, if we were able to do movies and events like that right now, we'd probably

1525
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:22,660
be seeing a lot of cult screenings of it.

1526
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:26,980
I actually hosted a screening of Scott Pilgrim.

1527
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:28,580
It was about two years ago.

1528
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:31,140
We did a, it was a double feature here.

1529
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:33,900
They did Kung Fury and they did Scott Pilgrim.

1530
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:36,260
It was like a gamer movie night.

1531
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:40,940
And they actually had one of the actors from Kung Fury there, which was pretty cool.

1532
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:44,340
Sadly, they were trying, I can't say who, but they were trying to get one of the people

1533
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:49,140
from Scott Pilgrim, but it didn't end up working out with their schedule or what have you.

1534
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:53,040
So I would have loved that, but they still showed the movie and it got a great response

1535
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,040
from the crowd.

1536
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:58,660
Like it's one of those movies that maybe, cause I don't think it did great at the box

1537
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:00,440
office when it first came out.

1538
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:03,980
But like, it's one of those movies that like, I think people of a certain age or just people

1539
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:09,880
that love games, they really enjoy it so much that like when you get a theater full of people

1540
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:13,880
that like Scott Pilgrim and like video games, it's a very different experience from when

1541
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,940
I saw it in the theater the first time.

1542
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:17,840
So I, that was fun.

1543
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:22,400
And I wish, you know, if COVID wasn't a thing, you'd probably see a lot of anniversary screenings

1544
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:25,520
going on right now, but yeah, bummer.

1545
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,320
So all right.

1546
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:31,720
Phoenix 7726 in chat says the comics got color versions too.

1547
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:32,720
Really slick.

1548
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:37,400
SSJ100 Matt says they were going to re-release the movie for Dolby Atmos theaters for the

1549
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:38,800
10 year anniversary.

1550
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:43,400
But COVID, oh, that sucks because obviously with the chiptune sound effects and everything

1551
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:46,160
really cool that that movie brought, that's a bummer.

1552
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:47,160
All right.

1553
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:53,000
Moving on some other rapid fire stories here, Commander Keen, Keen Dreams is coming to Nintendo

1554
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,400
Switch on August 27th, 2020.

1555
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,920
Of course, this is an old throwback.

1556
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:01,720
This is not a new Commander Keen game.

1557
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:07,680
This is like a throwback title to like episode, I think this is the four or five and six episode.

1558
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:11,920
I might be wrong because I think there is a Commander Keen series already on Switch.

1559
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,720
And this one is like the next one coming out.

1560
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:20,540
It is coming out, yeah, you can get the original Commander Keen and Keen Dreams for six bucks.

1561
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:28,400
And then the Definitive Edition is 15 bucks for full widescreen support, 12 all new levels,

1562
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:31,400
and it doubles the length of the original game and a full music score.

1563
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,280
Well, that's pretty cool.

1564
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:34,840
That must means Commander Keen did well enough.

1565
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:39,640
You know, I almost made that the classic game of the week this week, but then it made me

1566
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:43,400
think of MS-DOS games from the 90s and I thought of Scorched Earth and I was like,

1567
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:44,880
oh, we need to do that one.

1568
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:46,920
So all right.

1569
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:53,240
Also in the rumor department, although it's a pretty substantial rumor because it's it's

1570
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:57,460
from a picture, so it's probably happening.

1571
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:59,440
It's unfortunately not.

1572
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:00,440
Oh, really?

1573
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:01,440
It was fate?

1574
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:02,440
Yeah, it was.

1575
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:03,440
Oh, bummer.

1576
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:04,440
All right.

1577
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:05,440
Well, apparently it was.

1578
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,440
I just read about it.

1579
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:07,440
Yeah.

1580
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:08,440
All right.

1581
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:09,440
It was supposed to be a Virtua Fighter cabinet.

1582
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,680
Well, whoever photoshopped it did a really good job.

1583
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:12,680
Kudos to them.

1584
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:13,680
Who shot it down?

1585
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:16,040
Did Sega say something or Arcade 1up said something about it?

1586
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:17,040
Arcade 1up did.

1587
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,040
Yeah.

1588
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,040
Ah, bummer.

1589
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,040
All right.

1590
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:21,040
Well, then I won't say any more because it's already been debunked.

1591
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:22,040
All right.

1592
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:26,280
Instead, why don't I mention, um, damn, there was late breaking news before the show.

1593
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:27,840
And of course, in the moment, I can't remember.

1594
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:32,280
Oh, I was going to say they posted a picture though of their, um, it was, I forget it was

1595
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:33,760
one of the people that are working on Arcade 1up.

1596
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:38,520
They did post a actual like photo of what the pinball cabinets looked like.

1597
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:39,600
Oh, right.

1598
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:40,600
They look pretty awesome.

1599
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:41,600
Oh, that's awesome.

1600
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:42,720
Uh, I remember what it was.

1601
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:46,560
I saw floating around Twitter because it was trending on Twitter, apparently a, uh, listing

1602
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:52,680
for Zelda Skyward Sword, which was the Nintendo Wii title, not the, like the first one was

1603
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:53,680
Twilight Princess.

1604
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:57,680
Then Skyward Sword was kind of towards the end of the Wii's life cycle, a listing for

1605
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:00,400
that has been spotted for the Switch.

1606
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:06,240
So did Nintendo throw together a remaster to carry us through this holiday season, perhaps

1607
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:08,160
while some other games are waiting?

1608
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:11,120
It remains to be seen, but that is a very interesting development.

1609
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:16,040
Uh, if Skyward Sword is going to get a second chance, um, on, well, I don't think it necessarily

1610
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:19,160
did bad on the Wii cause the Wii was a huge selling console, but it came out towards the

1611
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:24,320
end of the Wii's life when the Wii U started kind of for better for worse showed up.

1612
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:28,480
So I think there may be a lot of people that didn't really get to experience Skyward Sword,

1613
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:32,760
even though I think that game is only about 10 years old, um, who may, uh, get to experience

1614
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:34,440
all over again on Switch.

1615
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:36,600
So we'll see what happens with that.

1616
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:37,600
Hmm.

1617
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:42,000
Um, now, uh, some folks in chat are talking about movie theaters reopening since I was

1618
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,320
talking about Scott Pilgrim, uh, and so forth.

1619
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:47,240
Uh, Phoenix 77 says, uh, theaters reopening.

1620
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:48,240
Anyone want to take bets?

1621
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:53,920
I'm thinking late 2021 to which Bobby like later this month to which Bobby Blackwell

1622
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:59,000
said AMC theaters are opening on August 20th movie tickets are 15 cents.

1623
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:04,240
But the question is, yeah, who's willing to go, uh, we'll say, I mean, I guess it depends

1624
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:05,240
on where you are.

1625
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:08,200
Here's, here's a, what was it?

1626
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:11,840
I was watching, um, Phil DeFranco on YouTube.

1627
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:15,160
And one of the things that he mentioned was, so for 15 cents a ticket, you can just buy

1628
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:19,800
out the whole theater and go buy yourself because there's only 30% capacity.

1629
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:21,440
I mean, like how much would that really cost?

1630
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:22,440
That's true.

1631
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:23,440
That's a good point.

1632
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:24,440
Pretty cheap.

1633
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:25,440
So just buy all the seats.

1634
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:29,960
Well, a lot of times the fine print for those deals say limit two per customer or something

1635
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:30,960
like that.

1636
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,160
So there's usually how they're going to get around it.

1637
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:34,160
Yep.

1638
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:35,160
Yeah.

1639
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:37,000
Drive in chat says drive in movies made a comeback around here.

1640
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Yeah.

1641
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Same.

1642
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,000
And now it's driving events too.

1643
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,280
I'm hearing about like drive in drag queen shows and things like that.

1644
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:43,680
It's very interesting.

1645
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:50,400
Just I just crossed my fingers and my toes, the vaccine is out for the holidays and it

1646
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,400
works.

1647
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:57,400
Um, cause I know there was the, the talk about the Russian vaccine, but they haven't really

1648
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:58,400
tested it.

1649
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:04,120
It sounds like so, but anyway, hopefully they will have a tested vetted, good, solid vaccine.

1650
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:09,520
That science says, yes, this will help stop the spread of COVID if people get this, then

1651
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,160
I will go to the damn movies.

1652
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:12,160
Yes.

1653
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:15,440
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, until then wear a fucking mask.

1654
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:16,440
Yes.

1655
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:17,440
Yes.

1656
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:18,440
All right.

1657
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:19,440
Let's move on.

1658
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:20,480
Uh, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

1659
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:23,160
Some more things you can play at home while you wait for the movie theaters to open back

1660
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:24,160
up.

1661
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:25,160
Yes.

1662
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:26,800
So this week we got quite a few good things.

1663
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:30,260
So Microsoft flight simulator coming out on PC.

1664
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:38,260
We have mortal shell on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one battle toads on PC and Xbox one

1665
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:45,900
cupid parasites on Nintendo switch, uh, danganronpa to goodbye despair anniversary edition on

1666
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:54,140
iOS and Android, uh, Oh, Kana for rhythm across the blue on Nintendo switch and PlayStation

1667
01:28:54,140 --> 01:29:02,460
four new super Lucky's tale on PlayStation four and Xbox one, uh, PGA tour, two K 21

1668
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:09,260
on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four, Xbox one and stadia, uh, samurai Jack battle

1669
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:15,100
through time on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

1670
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:18,100
And I believe that's it.

1671
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:19,100
All right.

1672
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:21,940
Then let's take a look at Japan and we'll look at the releases there.

1673
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:24,820
And uh, since Jamie's not here tonight, I'll ask you to do Europe as well.

1674
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:27,940
Uh, going over Japan and looking at the releases there.

1675
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:33,220
Cupid parasite comes out on the Nintendo switch and a regular and limited edition on the 20th

1676
01:29:33,220 --> 01:29:34,220
of this month.

1677
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:35,980
I'm trying to figure out what cupid parasite is.

1678
01:29:35,980 --> 01:29:40,940
Uh, it looks like it's another, uh, manga or anime, um, related title, a story about

1679
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:45,600
a cupid who ran away from her family after a fight to become the most successful bridal

1680
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,580
advisor in the human world.

1681
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:53,940
One day the heroin's boss calls her up for a job to find five hopeless guys or parasites

1682
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:59,700
in desperate need of fixing their love life and probably their personalities in some cases.

1683
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:01,340
Huh?

1684
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:04,100
That sounds like a disaster, but all right.

1685
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:10,380
Uh, anyway, on the PlayStation four this week in Japan, zombie survival colony builder,

1686
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:11,380
there are billions.

1687
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:13,720
That is the name of the game.

1688
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:17,700
Also rock of ages gets a localized release in Japan.

1689
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:22,660
Greed fall also gets a release in Japan this week on the PlayStation four.

1690
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:25,940
So let's go to the UK and the UK.

1691
01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:31,860
We also have Microsoft flight simulator on PC, uh, pathfinder Kingmaker deluxe edition

1692
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:39,940
on places for an Xbox one, uh, Willie jet man, Astro monkeys, revenge, sweeper edition.

1693
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:47,500
That's on PlayStation four and quite the name, uh, mr driller drill land on Nintendo switch

1694
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:54,580
PGA tour, two K 21 on PlayStation four and Xbox one house flipper on PlayStation four

1695
01:30:54,580 --> 01:31:01,700
Xbox one and Nintendo switch, um, made of sker on Xbox one.

1696
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:05,160
Now that's going to be hilarious if that's a survivor horror game, cause it kind of looks

1697
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:14,620
like that based on a screenshot made of sker, uh, pinstripe on Nintendo switch, a Kana four

1698
01:31:14,620 --> 01:31:18,140
rhythms across the blue on Nintendo switch.

1699
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:19,140
And that's it.

1700
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:22,340
All right, let's get to the mailbag every week.

1701
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:27,780
You guys send us emails, participate at orange lounge, radio.com and we read all the emails

1702
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:29,780
that aren't spam on the air.

1703
01:31:29,780 --> 01:31:33,980
So our first email this night comes to us from red entertainment who starts off saying

1704
01:31:33,980 --> 01:31:38,580
hello peoples and sends us a link to a story we talked about earlier in the show.

1705
01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:42,340
There's something about Apple's move to pull fortnight from the app store that doesn't

1706
01:31:42,340 --> 01:31:43,340
make sense to me.

1707
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:46,700
And when I dig around a bit, it still doesn't make sense to me.

1708
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:50,260
Apple released a statement about you, about their move that I'm not going to repeat here

1709
01:31:50,260 --> 01:31:55,620
because it's a peak example of utilizing incomprehensible legalese in order to befuddle the masses.

1710
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:59,900
If you stare at Apple statement long enough and reread it enough times, you get the vague

1711
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:03,660
impression that Epic violates Apple's rules as it related to payment.

1712
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:05,900
Okay, what are those rules?

1713
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:09,820
And I'm going to assume before this email or this email may have come in before Google

1714
01:32:09,820 --> 01:32:13,820
was involved in this too, because there was about a 12 hour period where Apple pulled

1715
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:16,220
them and then Google pulled them, right?

1716
01:32:16,220 --> 01:32:17,220
I'm not sure.

1717
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:20,220
Yeah, it was pretty, pretty short but it was a few hours.

1718
01:32:20,220 --> 01:32:23,900
This email seems to be focusing on the Apple side of things, but I do want to clarify that.

1719
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:30,380
Anyway, red entertainment continues and actually links to the Apple guidelines and continues.

1720
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:34,220
If you read Apple's rules as it's related to payment in section 311, you come across

1721
01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:35,220
this line.

1722
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:40,980
Apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that

1723
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:44,660
direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.

1724
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:47,740
There, that's the rule Epic appears to have violated.

1725
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:51,980
When Epic told users how to purchase in-game currency outside of the Fortnite iOS app and

1726
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:54,900
enabled users to do exactly that, they violated Apple's rules.

1727
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:56,180
Okay, that's simple.

1728
01:32:56,180 --> 01:32:57,600
Why didn't Apple just say that?

1729
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:01,360
Why did Apple put out a statement that's filled with incomprehensible legal jargon?

1730
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:04,800
Why couldn't Apple explain their actions in a way that is easily understandable by

1731
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:05,800
humans?

1732
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:07,320
Now, I know what you're thinking.

1733
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:12,000
I don't have to pay for, insert app here, through Apple in order to use, insert Apple

1734
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,680
here, on my Apple device.

1735
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:14,680
That's right, you don't.

1736
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:17,320
A notable example of this is Spotify.

1737
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:19,620
Spotify has subscription plans for its users.

1738
01:33:19,620 --> 01:33:23,720
You cannot sign up for any of those subscription plans inside the Spotify iOS app.

1739
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:27,600
Is there a button inside the Spotify that takes you to where you can sign up for a subscription?

1740
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:28,600
No.

1741
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:29,600
Is there a link that can do the same?

1742
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:30,600
No.

1743
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:34,480
Does the Spotify tell you what you have to go outside the app to sign up for a subscription?

1744
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:35,480
No.

1745
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:38,160
What does the Spotify app say about how to sign up for a subscription?

1746
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:40,280
You can't upgrade to premium in the app.

1747
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:41,280
We know.

1748
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:42,280
It's not ideal.

1749
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:43,280
And that's it.

1750
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:47,920
That's why the Spotify iOS app is currently available in the app store and Fortnite isn't.

1751
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:51,040
Spotify doesn't tell you that you have to go outside the app to give it money.

1752
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,200
Fortnite did.

1753
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:59,000
Stay care, stay care, entertainment sent from my iPhone.

1754
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,560
I thought I'd throw that in there.

1755
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:04,880
Anyway, no, I mean, and honestly, yes, you're right.

1756
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:09,560
And that is exactly like, and I think I kind of mentioned this before, when we have the

1757
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:13,000
example of Twitch, Twitch will sell the bits in the app.

1758
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,600
They will also sell those same bits on their website, but they don't advertise it in the

1759
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:17,600
app.

1760
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,520
That's what Epic's trying to do.

1761
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,520
And Epic broke the rules.

1762
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:27,120
Now you do make a good point about, or a good, you raise a good question, we'll say, about

1763
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:33,920
why doesn't Apple just respond in plain language instead of all this legalese?

1764
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:39,920
I don't disagree, but my thought is, well, Epic's now made it a legal issue.

1765
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:44,700
So it's being responded to in legalese because anything Apple says at this point can and

1766
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:46,960
will be used against them in a court.

1767
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:53,760
So I think, that's my thought, why they're responding with legalese.

1768
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:56,320
But otherwise, I think you're right.

1769
01:34:56,520 --> 01:35:02,360
If Epic wasn't trying to do this whole click here for a 20% off sale, it probably wouldn't

1770
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:03,800
be an issue.

1771
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:06,680
But they did it on purpose because they wanted to make it an issue.

1772
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:08,120
They knew what they were doing.

1773
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:12,800
Because they want to put their own store on Apple's front.

1774
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:18,720
And that's gonna probably be exhibit A, is that, well, they knew what they were doing

1775
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:25,960
because look at this prepared video that they made because they wanted to be fancy like

1776
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:28,960
I don't know.

1777
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:35,480
Epic is not a saint in this whole thing and that is very, very important to note.

1778
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:39,960
Anyway, but otherwise, honestly, your email is a lot of the same stuff I've been thinking

1779
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:44,080
and I like that you actually, you brought the receipt when it came to what the rule

1780
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:45,080
is that they violated.

1781
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:46,480
All right, moving on.

1782
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:50,640
We have one more email tonight and this one is from Elliot B. who says in this email,

1783
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:55,560
hey, OLR, I made another game and I want to share it with you all.

1784
01:35:56,160 --> 01:36:02,560
It's a music game heavily inspired by Guitaro Man called Chiptari Woman.

1785
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:07,040
Since it doesn't seem like there will be an official sequel anytime soon, I decided to

1786
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:08,640
make my own.

1787
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:16,240
It was for low res jam where the maximum resolution for submissions is 64 by 64.

1788
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:21,000
At least they gave participants a leisurely two and a half weeks to finish it.

1789
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:27,600
Here's the link, pawprints.itch.io slash Chiptari Woman.

1790
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:32,160
I'm actually going to copy paste that into the chat since that's a lot and for the folks

1791
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:38,680
that are listening on the podcast, I imagine if you go to that itch.io store, pawprints.itch.io,

1792
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:40,640
you'll find it there pretty easy.

1793
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:46,040
I've attached a video of the first minute of gameplay too and finally for a change,

1794
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:52,000
I was able to grab the video in time and get it loaded here so you can actually see it.

1795
01:36:52,000 --> 01:37:00,440
So this is Chiptari Woman created by one of our listeners, Elliot B. for the low res jam

1796
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:03,920
and I've got to say, this looks awesome.

1797
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:05,600
You've done a very good job.

1798
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,080
I would play this.

1799
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:09,320
I would likely pay money for this.

1800
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:14,040
I also want to know, did you do the music because that's really good if you did or did

1801
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:24,080
you get a friend or did you get a free domain type stuff or I'm curious where the music

1802
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:28,840
came from because it's really good and one of the important things that makes a music

1803
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:33,000
game is, is the music good?

1804
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,480
And some comments that are coming in from chat, Elliot, because I don't know if you're

1805
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:37,560
here live.

1806
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:38,680
This looks cool.

1807
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:40,640
Wow, this looks great.

1808
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:42,040
This is so cool.

1809
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:45,400
I want to fly through a wall and start jamming too because that's what happened with the

1810
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:47,840
little guy in the minute long teaser here.

1811
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:50,920
So yeah, and that's a 64 by 64 resolution.

1812
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:54,360
So kudos to you, Elliot B. like this looks awesome.

1813
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:59,120
So I will check this out and all those questions I just asked are probably answered on that

1814
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:01,520
store page and I probably just need to go take a look at it.

1815
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:02,520
In fact, I'm going to do that now.

1816
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:04,000
Can you see the video, Loki?

1817
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,200
Yeah, it looks pretty cool.

1818
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:09,280
Yeah, and this looks cool.

1819
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:14,160
So the music is done by, it's by Merkle, M R K L is the artist's name.

1820
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:15,160
Thank you.

1821
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:16,160
Okay.

1822
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:17,200
But yeah, that's awesome.

1823
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:19,720
So it is original music though by Merkle.

1824
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:27,040
So yeah, it says adorable pixel art and other worldly opponent and it works with game pads

1825
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:28,600
if your browser supports it.

1826
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:29,920
Oh, look who just popped up in chat.

1827
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:30,920
Elliot B's in chat.

1828
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:32,440
Kudos to you, my friend.

1829
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:34,360
This looks really good.

1830
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:37,360
You should like sell this.

1831
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:38,360
I don't know.

1832
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:39,360
I mean, I don't know.

1833
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:43,240
I, you know, maybe you'll want to have it at a resolution that still looks retro, but

1834
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:44,840
like plays on phones or something.

1835
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:46,840
I don't know.

1836
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:48,920
But you're onto something here.

1837
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:50,440
That's for sure.

1838
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:56,160
So Phoenix 7726 says Merkle like Angela Merkle.

1839
01:38:56,160 --> 01:39:05,240
No it's M R K L and it's in, they have their own itch.io storefront and mrkl.itch.io.

1840
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:08,880
So there you go.

1841
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:11,080
Kudos to you, Elliot.

1842
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:13,760
You know, we're in the wrong business, Loki.

1843
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:19,560
We need to start like a indie promotion business because we've got some great game makers we've

1844
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:24,720
come across over the years here at OLR, including YYR, right?

1845
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:27,020
And all the wonderful games he's done.

1846
01:39:27,020 --> 01:39:33,640
And now we have Elliot B. So I want, what other indie developers are lurking out there?

1847
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:34,640
Fix your games.

1848
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:35,880
Send us emails.

1849
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:36,880
Why not?

1850
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:38,040
We love indie titles.

1851
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:39,600
So that's great.

1852
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:40,920
And Elliot B says, thanks guys.

1853
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:42,520
The nice comments mean a lot to me.

1854
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:44,600
Well, it's, it's, it's well fucking done.

1855
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:45,600
Good for you.

1856
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:47,960
Uh, I, I, I'm going to play this after the show.

1857
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:48,960
I really am.

1858
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:49,960
So cool.

1859
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:51,120
All right.

1860
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:56,560
Chiptari Woman, SSJ 100 Matt says I'm dropping the game link in the discord for the podcast

1861
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:57,560
listeners.

1862
01:39:57,560 --> 01:39:58,760
Ah, very good.

1863
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:00,040
A call for play.

1864
01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:03,680
Elliot B says, how much will the next plug cost?

1865
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:06,680
Honestly, all the plugs here are free.

1866
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:13,600
Like we don't really make money off OLR, so I'm not gonna, um, you know, I mean, we're

1867
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:18,880
not going to plug the same game every single week, but you know, I want to support, Hey,

1868
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:19,880
you guys support us.

1869
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:20,880
We'll support you.

1870
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:23,160
Especially when the games look that good.

1871
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:25,720
All right.

1872
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:26,720
Let's move on.

1873
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:28,840
Uh, that's it for emails tonight.

1874
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:31,320
Let's move on to some more stories.

1875
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:33,080
Loki, you are up.

1876
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:34,080
Yes.

1877
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:41,720
Um, so this is once again, a, an example of what not to do if you're making a fan game.

1878
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:49,160
So there has been this project, uh, this golden eye double seven remake project that's been

1879
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:54,160
several years into development, golden nine 25.

1880
01:40:54,160 --> 01:41:01,160
And apparently over the last few years, they've posted several, uh, screenshots videos to

1881
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:03,600
social media.

1882
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:04,880
And what do you think happened?

1883
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:06,120
Oh, that's right.

1884
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:07,120
Yes.

1885
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:11,480
They got a cease and desist from MGM because they didn't have permission to make a fan

1886
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:14,880
game for, uh, golden eye double seven.

1887
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:17,080
So yep.

1888
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:21,520
So unfortunately they can't do a bond game, but they can still do a great game with all

1889
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:24,600
of the, um, nineties action shooter aspects.

1890
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:29,640
So basically what they're going to do is take what they did with golden eye and change it

1891
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:31,680
enough to be not golden.

1892
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:36,960
Change all the characters, make tweaks to the artwork and release it as an original

1893
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:37,960
title.

1894
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:38,960
Ka-blam.

1895
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:39,960
Yep.

1896
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:40,960
Done.

1897
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:41,960
There you go.

1898
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:42,960
Yep.

1899
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:43,960
Yeah.

1900
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:44,960
All right.

1901
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:48,640
So, and also lesson learned, don't post about your, um, potentially illegal and, uh, IP

1902
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:53,600
infringing title on social media, because sometimes, uh, there's some social media folks,

1903
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:57,480
like they scan social media for certain things all the time and double Oh seven might be

1904
01:41:57,480 --> 01:42:01,520
one of them that they're looking for, especially because there was a new movie we were supposed

1905
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:06,160
to have back in April, but you know, it didn't happen.

1906
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:10,280
Um, and I don't, they didn't release that double Oh seven movie and I can't even remember

1907
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:15,540
the name in the moment, but they didn't release that to, uh, the home services there.

1908
01:42:15,540 --> 01:42:18,420
Still hoping they can do a theatrical release maybe next year.

1909
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:19,420
Huh?

1910
01:42:19,420 --> 01:42:20,420
At least not yet.

1911
01:42:20,420 --> 01:42:21,420
Yeah.

1912
01:42:21,420 --> 01:42:22,420
Let me change your mind.

1913
01:42:22,420 --> 01:42:23,420
Who knows?

1914
01:42:23,420 --> 01:42:30,100
Well, if I feel like Disney was almost bullied into it with Mulan, like, and what they did,

1915
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:36,700
which I, I still don't love the whole subscribe to Disney plus and pay a premium for Mulan.

1916
01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:40,180
But I also understand it's probably cheaper than going to the movies and some people will

1917
01:42:40,180 --> 01:42:41,980
still pay it, especially those with kids.

1918
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:43,320
I don't have kids.

1919
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:48,460
So my perspective on this is maybe different, um, but, and it'll probably be free on Disney

1920
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:49,460
plus eventually.

1921
01:42:49,460 --> 01:42:52,340
It's just, if I want to see it now, I'm gonna have to pay more money.

1922
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:58,940
So anyway, all right, well, let's move on and let's talk about, so this one has to do

1923
01:42:58,940 --> 01:43:03,300
with hackers and you know, we say around here, hackers going to hack, they're going to find

1924
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:04,300
things.

1925
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:10,340
Uh, and in this case, hackers have found an official of sorts PlayStation one emulator

1926
01:43:10,340 --> 01:43:13,260
for the PlayStation four.

1927
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:18,180
So in other words, they're trying to pretty much say Sony could offer a PlayStation one

1928
01:43:18,180 --> 01:43:24,740
emulator if they wanted to, because it was embedded in the medieval remaster that came

1929
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:31,240
out in 2019 the remaster of medieval had the original game in it.

1930
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:35,940
And so hackers went in, got that emulator and basically, you know, made it so that you

1931
01:43:35,940 --> 01:43:40,760
can run it on a modified PlayStation four and you can play original PlayStation games

1932
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:43,020
at up to a 4k resolution.

1933
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:44,840
But of course there's a catch.

1934
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:46,780
It doesn't play everything cleanly.

1935
01:43:46,780 --> 01:43:52,020
Uh, for example, there's some video out there of Konami's original silent Hill game running

1936
01:43:52,020 --> 01:43:53,020
on it.

1937
01:43:53,020 --> 01:43:57,660
And some of the, like the sprites have really light boxes around them and some things don't

1938
01:43:57,660 --> 01:43:58,660
work right.

1939
01:43:58,660 --> 01:44:01,620
Um, yeah, it's the fog of the end of the Emmy.

1940
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:06,180
A lot of the emulators have trouble with Fox, even the official ones from Konami, that's

1941
01:44:06,180 --> 01:44:07,180
very true.

1942
01:44:07,180 --> 01:44:08,180
They're parked correctly.

1943
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:09,500
That is very true.

1944
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:15,800
So, uh, yeah, so anyway, uh, it's also possible that this is used to run, uh, actual classic

1945
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:17,780
games available on PlayStation store.

1946
01:44:17,780 --> 01:44:22,560
I don't remember what PS one games are on the PlayStation store is VIP ribbon PlayStation

1947
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:24,880
four or is that, was that on the three?

1948
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:25,880
I can't even remember.

1949
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:29,860
So long ago now that they finally re-released VIP ribbon in English, but I think that was

1950
01:44:29,860 --> 01:44:30,860
on the three.

1951
01:44:30,860 --> 01:44:31,860
Yeah.

1952
01:44:31,860 --> 01:44:34,580
Uh, Oh, and the Vita, that's why it felt a little newer.

1953
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:40,220
Uh, and then of course we all know the PlayStation classic came out in 2018.

1954
01:44:40,220 --> 01:44:41,380
That was a thing that happened.

1955
01:44:41,380 --> 01:44:45,120
And of course hackers were on that like that and got all the PlayStation ones and they

1956
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:46,820
worked a little better on that one.

1957
01:44:46,820 --> 01:44:50,620
So, but it's interesting to see that the PlayStation four, you know, obviously they would have

1958
01:44:50,620 --> 01:44:56,420
to make some tweaks to get the other games to run right, but they could, I don't think

1959
01:44:56,420 --> 01:45:00,780
many of us are surprised to hear that, especially when PlayStation two games were running very

1960
01:45:00,780 --> 01:45:04,440
well on the PlayStation four, uh, especially, you know, like when they were selling things

1961
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:09,140
like Prapa the Rapa two and things like that, they, they play fine on the PlayStation four,

1962
01:45:09,140 --> 01:45:12,980
although I'm sure each and every one of those titles, probably they had to test it and make

1963
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:16,300
sure it didn't have fog and those types of issues.

1964
01:45:16,300 --> 01:45:21,380
So, um, but it's, it's still interesting to see how hackers went in and grabbed that emulator.

1965
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:26,180
And now, you know, it's like an official emulator of sorts, uh, even though it doesn't emulate

1966
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:27,180
everything yet.

1967
01:45:27,180 --> 01:45:28,180
Perfectly.

1968
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:29,180
All right.

1969
01:45:29,180 --> 01:45:30,180
Let's move on.

1970
01:45:30,180 --> 01:45:31,180
Loki.

1971
01:45:31,180 --> 01:45:32,180
All right.

1972
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:36,040
Let's talk a little bit about, um, bugs.

1973
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:41,420
So Red Dead Online, they, you may remember that there was protests and stuff to try to

1974
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:47,060
get updates to grant or wants to grant the Red Dead Online.

1975
01:45:47,060 --> 01:45:54,940
However, uh, when they implemented the new updates into the game, it broke a lot of stuff.

1976
01:45:54,940 --> 01:46:01,960
So you had all sorts of crazy stuff like flying horses, raining alligators, um, stuff that

1977
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:06,260
you're not normally supposed to see in Red Dead Redemption.

1978
01:46:06,260 --> 01:46:12,980
Um, I think that's hilarious, but probably doesn't make for a great online experience.

1979
01:46:12,980 --> 01:46:22,900
Um, so because of that, they ended up walking back that patch 1.21 and yeah, no word on

1980
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:29,500
when it's going to be fixed yet, but that's kind of unfortunate that this had to happen.

1981
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:35,820
You'd think that they would have, uh, tested some more stuff, but I guess, I guess not.

1982
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:36,820
Yeah.

1983
01:46:36,820 --> 01:46:41,340
Uh, sounds like Red Dead Online keeps having these issues and it's probably, I know it's

1984
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:44,980
been irritating you and, and a lot of people out there on the internet, cause it's kind

1985
01:46:44,980 --> 01:46:50,160
of like, it's just making the game seem cheaper and like this was supposed to be a much bigger

1986
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:54,360
and badder game than what it, the online components turned into, right?

1987
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:56,160
They better, they better watch out.

1988
01:46:56,160 --> 01:47:00,160
Any bug here and Todd Howard's going to try to re-release it for the fifth time.

1989
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:02,840
So I don't know.

1990
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:05,000
Watch out.

1991
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:10,080
Speaking of which, uh, bugs and such Bethesda, a quick follow up to something we talked about

1992
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:13,640
on last week's show, Quake 2 was free on the launcher this week.

1993
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:19,480
And I think it might still be if, uh, uh, Ragenator is still out there listening somewhere.

1994
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:24,720
I think Quake 2 is still free on the Bethesda launcher because I know Quake 3, which is

1995
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:29,560
like the superior Quake, it takes over, I think tomorrow, uh, and will be free on the

1996
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:31,080
Bethesda launcher for a week.

1997
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:35,320
So that's exciting, which is, I mean, I already own Quake 3 on Steam cause I think I bought

1998
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:38,520
it for like five bucks, probably like 10 years ago on Steam.

1999
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:41,600
Uh, but Quake 3 really is like the best Quake.

2000
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:43,560
It's a lot, that's a really fun PVP as well.

2001
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:47,240
So just a quick follow up tips since we were talking about buggy games that made me remember,

2002
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:48,740
Oh yeah, Bethesda.

2003
01:47:48,740 --> 01:47:51,340
So all right.

2004
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:55,900
As as does have, did you know though, I didn't know this, um, the Bethesda launcher since

2005
01:47:55,900 --> 01:48:00,660
I've never really used it before and this was, ain't nothing for free, right?

2006
01:48:00,660 --> 01:48:02,440
This is exactly what Bethesda wanted.

2007
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:05,780
I'm going to go in and look around the launcher and see what else is there.

2008
01:48:05,780 --> 01:48:13,020
I didn't realize they put out like official Skyrim mod making tools, uh, as well as Fallout

2009
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:15,700
4 that like you can design your own quests and stuff.

2010
01:48:15,700 --> 01:48:18,380
Yeah, that was a long time ago.

2011
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:24,220
So they, I never realized it was the same tool that they use to make quests that they

2012
01:48:24,220 --> 01:48:26,920
put out, which I thought was interesting.

2013
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:31,420
So they, they did that in the sense that that was back when they had those enhancements

2014
01:48:31,420 --> 01:48:34,980
that they were adding to the game, the paid mods basically.

2015
01:48:34,980 --> 01:48:40,980
So the thing was, Oh yeah, you can release your mods through the, um, Bethesda storefront

2016
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:42,100
or whatever.

2017
01:48:42,100 --> 01:48:44,640
And then also you could, um, sell them.

2018
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:48,280
I think you could sell them as well through there as well.

2019
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:54,800
Um, but I know then they turn to sell a lot of those mods as well through the storefront.

2020
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:59,600
And that's how you get like, you know, where skin in the game costs like 20 bucks.

2021
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:00,600
It's ridiculous.

2022
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:05,680
Um, but yeah, I know that stuff's available, but I, I'm sure that there's other tool sets

2023
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:10,560
out there that aren't official that worked just as well because there was lots of bots

2024
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:12,320
before that whole thing came out.

2025
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,320
So they had to do it somehow.

2026
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:21,000
All right, well moving on, uh, Twitch Prime is no more and that's because it's been rebranded.

2027
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,860
So Twitch Prime is now Prime Gaming.

2028
01:49:23,860 --> 01:49:28,600
And that happened earlier this week where, uh, Amazon who of course is over Twitch, uh,

2029
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:34,100
rebranded all of the perks that you're used to getting with Twitch Prime under Prime Gaming.

2030
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:39,520
This is probably to come in line with services like Prime Video, Prime Reading and Prime

2031
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:40,520
Gaming.

2032
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:42,320
Otherwise they haven't really made a lot of changes to it.

2033
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:48,320
You still get your free subscription to a channel, which I would be a bad broadcaster

2034
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:52,560
if I didn't try to encourage you to use that free one right here at VOG Network where you

2035
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:56,760
get access to our video archives to watch on demand whenever you want.

2036
01:49:56,760 --> 01:50:01,320
If you can't be here on Sunday night, our subscribers, whether it's through the free

2037
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:04,160
Prime Gaming subscription or through a $5 sub.

2038
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:08,640
And I think the subs might actually be, I saw that subs were discounted for first timers.

2039
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:12,440
They might be running a free promotion right now, or not free, but like a promotion of

2040
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:13,440
sorts right now.

2041
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:16,080
So I look into that cause I was checking that out for the show.

2042
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:18,680
But anyway, uh, you get access to the full video archives.

2043
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:24,360
Of course the podcast, the audio still free as it's been for 18 years.

2044
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:30,000
We did not charge for anything that we, um, we're always giving away for free that is

2045
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,600
staying free.

2046
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:36,820
So um, anyway, yeah, so Prime Gaming is, is it now, um, that's the one that gets you some

2047
01:50:36,820 --> 01:50:40,340
game perks as well and some, uh, stuff in games.

2048
01:50:40,340 --> 01:50:45,980
Um, I can't say we're all going to be quick to remember this rebranding and I'm probably

2049
01:50:45,980 --> 01:50:50,620
still going to say Twitch Prime, your Twitch Prime account and all that, uh, because I've

2050
01:50:50,620 --> 01:50:54,900
just, you say one thing for so many years, it takes a little while to get used to it.

2051
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:57,860
I'm sure there'll be a lot of broadcasters in the same boat.

2052
01:50:57,860 --> 01:51:01,400
Um, but that's, uh, that's just part of the switch there.

2053
01:51:01,400 --> 01:51:02,400
You know what we mean?

2054
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:03,400
You know?

2055
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:04,400
Exactly.

2056
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:05,400
You know what we mean?

2057
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:09,080
Jeff says, yeah, there's a promotion, I think, and streamers get more for Prime subs.

2058
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:10,680
Oh, is that true?

2059
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:14,640
Well then you should really consider using that one.

2060
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:15,640
I have to try.

2061
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:20,220
I'm a bad broadcaster if I know, but you know what, Hey, if you don't even give us a dime,

2062
01:51:20,220 --> 01:51:21,220
that is okay too.

2063
01:51:21,220 --> 01:51:22,220
I understand.

2064
01:51:22,220 --> 01:51:27,140
Uh, especially in these times, money is hard to come by, but, uh, we do use money to make

2065
01:51:27,140 --> 01:51:30,420
improvements to the show and there'll be more coming later on.

2066
01:51:30,420 --> 01:51:31,420
So all right.

2067
01:51:31,420 --> 01:51:32,420
Yeah.

2068
01:51:33,420 --> 01:51:37,780
How many times did we say all games radio by accident after moving to vog or how many

2069
01:51:37,780 --> 01:51:43,960
times did I say, and you can join our chat at a game surge or whatever, or a live dot

2070
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:44,960
vog network.com.

2071
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:52,080
I still say that just out of habit, mail bag at orange, which is the old email.

2072
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:53,080
Don't use it.

2073
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:54,720
It'll bounce participate at orange laundry.

2074
01:51:54,720 --> 01:51:57,640
Do.com is the place to send those emails.

2075
01:51:57,640 --> 01:51:58,640
All right.

2076
01:51:58,760 --> 01:52:02,180
Let's move on some more things before we get to our listener round table.

2077
01:52:02,180 --> 01:52:03,180
Loki.

2078
01:52:03,180 --> 01:52:04,180
Yes.

2079
01:52:04,180 --> 01:52:09,420
So, you know, it seems like there's so many art, little mini arcade cabinets coming out.

2080
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:11,200
I can't keep track of all of them.

2081
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:15,160
Well now there's another, uh, Neo Geo arcade home machine.

2082
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:20,500
So this is not quite the super mini one that they had, but this is more of like your arcade

2083
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:22,380
one up bar top type cabinets.

2084
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:25,200
So it's going to run $500.

2085
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:30,080
However, unlike you would get with say an arcade one up cabinet, there's going to be

2086
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:33,740
a few more games in there, 50 games total.

2087
01:52:33,740 --> 01:52:41,480
So all your favorites from the SNK and the Neo Geo.

2088
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:45,360
And they also have a stand you can get as well.

2089
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:49,660
That kind of turns into an upright cabinet, although it looks kind of strange, but still

2090
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:56,480
pretty slick looking, um, and the stand itself as an extra 50 bucks, that's not bad.

2091
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:57,480
Yeah.

2092
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:59,340
I have to say I'm kind of interested.

2093
01:52:59,340 --> 01:53:03,660
One person that's not interested in our chat room, Bobby Black Wolf, who says I was excited

2094
01:53:03,660 --> 01:53:07,240
about this until I saw it did not have bust to move.

2095
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:09,360
That was literally the only game I was interested in.

2096
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:15,060
Um, yeah, I love that game, but there's other games, uh, that, that SNK did that I'd be

2097
01:53:15,060 --> 01:53:16,060
okay with.

2098
01:53:16,060 --> 01:53:21,400
So, um, it does sound very interesting to me, uh, as Joe and her mat says, I like this

2099
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:26,720
Neo Geo cab act F says, I really love the Neo Geo cab, uh, and SJ one on a mat says

2100
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:29,460
it's an SNK fighting game gamer's dream.

2101
01:53:29,460 --> 01:53:33,620
You know, they had that other little Neo Geo cab not that long ago.

2102
01:53:33,620 --> 01:53:37,800
Um, and so it's interesting that they're kind of doing another one that's just bigger and

2103
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:40,500
a little more inspired by the arcade one up stuff.

2104
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:45,780
As long as I could put it into like a four game mode or whatever that has it cycle through

2105
01:53:45,780 --> 01:53:53,280
those like it used to with the arcade cabinet that used to be in the, uh, like, uh, grocery

2106
01:53:53,280 --> 01:54:00,660
store I used to go to needs to have like baseball stars, magician, Lord, and I want to say metal

2107
01:54:00,660 --> 01:54:02,140
slug in there.

2108
01:54:02,140 --> 01:54:03,820
Probably metal slug.

2109
01:54:03,820 --> 01:54:06,860
I think it was also like art of fatal fury or something in there.

2110
01:54:06,860 --> 01:54:08,920
I also, I can't think of the game in the moment.

2111
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:10,020
There was another puzzle game.

2112
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:12,740
So you may be angry about bust to move, not being there.

2113
01:54:12,740 --> 01:54:13,740
Puzzle de Pawn.

2114
01:54:13,740 --> 01:54:14,740
I love that.

2115
01:54:14,780 --> 01:54:17,980
Is that a puzzle de Pawn where you pull the balls down and you throw the balls back up

2116
01:54:17,980 --> 01:54:22,820
in the matching colors that's puzzled upon, uh, puzzle de Pawn is kind of like a bust

2117
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:26,180
to move sort of thing, but that was the one that I used to play all the time.

2118
01:54:26,180 --> 01:54:29,700
There's one where you, I can't remember the name in the moment you pull the balls down

2119
01:54:29,700 --> 01:54:33,020
and then you go run over to the column with the matching ones and throw them back up.

2120
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:35,220
And I can't remember the name of it, but that was an SNK one too.

2121
01:54:35,220 --> 01:54:36,220
I don't know.

2122
01:54:36,220 --> 01:54:39,100
I don't know what that one was, but yeah, the one I used to play that was like a bust

2123
01:54:39,100 --> 01:54:41,500
to move with puzzle de Pawn.

2124
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:42,500
Okay.

2125
01:54:42,740 --> 01:54:44,540
And is that on the cab?

2126
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:46,740
No, there's not very many.

2127
01:54:46,740 --> 01:54:47,740
Thank you.

2128
01:54:47,740 --> 01:54:49,140
Dark to see a magical drop.

2129
01:54:49,140 --> 01:54:50,140
That's it.

2130
01:54:50,140 --> 01:54:51,140
Thank you.

2131
01:54:51,140 --> 01:54:52,140
Yeah.

2132
01:54:52,140 --> 01:54:53,140
Yeah.

2133
01:54:53,140 --> 01:54:55,700
It's mostly, it looks like it's mostly fighting games, metal slug, and they have a couple

2134
01:54:55,700 --> 01:54:57,020
of like sports games on there.

2135
01:54:57,020 --> 01:55:02,940
So baseball stars, football frenzy, top player or top players, golf and super sidekicks.

2136
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:07,900
Um, but the most, most of it is looks like just fighting.

2137
01:55:07,900 --> 01:55:11,300
In fact, I'd say 90% of it is fighting games.

2138
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:12,300
Kind of disappointing.

2139
01:55:12,300 --> 01:55:16,340
I mean, I get it, but like, I would hope that there's more of a variety of stuff.

2140
01:55:16,340 --> 01:55:19,540
Maybe because maybe a lot of that's third party.

2141
01:55:19,540 --> 01:55:20,660
I don't know.

2142
01:55:20,660 --> 01:55:27,100
I'm just used to my, my, was it not Pandora's box, but I have a not quite legit multi-cart

2143
01:55:27,100 --> 01:55:28,460
that now Bobby owns.

2144
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:32,900
Uh, they had like a ton of like games on the puzzle de Pawn was one I did play on there.

2145
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:35,260
One of the first games I played on my arcade cabinet.

2146
01:55:35,260 --> 01:55:36,260
Nice.

2147
01:55:36,260 --> 01:55:37,260
All right.

2148
01:55:37,260 --> 01:55:38,260
One more story for you guys.

2149
01:55:38,260 --> 01:55:44,180
And it's about, uh, an event for next year already making changes, uh, because of, you

2150
01:55:44,180 --> 01:55:46,740
know, potentially COVID and related things.

2151
01:55:46,740 --> 01:55:51,860
And it's the game developers conference or GDC number one, they've pushed it way back.

2152
01:55:51,860 --> 01:55:57,060
So GDC next year is going to be in July, July 19th through 23rd.

2153
01:55:57,060 --> 01:55:58,660
That's after E3.

2154
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:00,260
That's not where they're usually at.

2155
01:56:00,260 --> 01:56:03,360
GDC was usually a March thing, if I remember right.

2156
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:05,620
So they're pushing it way back for next year.

2157
01:56:05,620 --> 01:56:10,640
So they must really be banking on, you know, there's going to be a vaccine or something,

2158
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:14,900
but even with all that, they're saying it's going to be a scaled down edition of the live

2159
01:56:14,900 --> 01:56:15,900
show.

2160
01:56:15,900 --> 01:56:18,900
They will have it at the Moscone center in San Francisco where they usually have it,

2161
01:56:18,900 --> 01:56:21,780
but there will also be an online showcase.

2162
01:56:21,780 --> 01:56:23,380
So it's going to be a little bit of a hybrid event.

2163
01:56:23,380 --> 01:56:28,740
Uh, there's going to be publishers and developers showing things online as well as face to face.

2164
01:56:28,740 --> 01:56:33,140
Um, there's no official comment that this is because of COVID.

2165
01:56:33,140 --> 01:56:36,020
Um, that's kind of what's being inferred.

2166
01:56:36,020 --> 01:56:39,460
People are assuming that, you know, there might still be issues related to COVID, or

2167
01:56:39,460 --> 01:56:43,100
maybe we just won't be ready for the gigantic crowds at that point, you know, because it's

2168
01:56:43,100 --> 01:56:46,220
going to take time to get a lot of people vaccinated and then there's going to be people

2169
01:56:46,220 --> 01:56:49,980
that aren't going to get vaccinated because they're going to be like, oh, it's inserting

2170
01:56:49,980 --> 01:56:53,940
a microchip in my brain and all this stuff, whatever, whatever.

2171
01:56:53,940 --> 01:56:54,940
Anyway.

2172
01:56:54,940 --> 01:57:00,060
So, um, you know, there's, it's going to take a little time probably, you know, these huge

2173
01:57:00,060 --> 01:57:02,540
events are going to be the last thing to come back.

2174
01:57:02,540 --> 01:57:07,180
So I can see why they're kind of, you know, doing a little bit of both.

2175
01:57:07,180 --> 01:57:11,980
Um, so, and, and also, it also makes sense that if things were to happen and things were

2176
01:57:11,980 --> 01:57:15,940
still in a bad place, I mean, heaven forbid, but if things were still in a bad place in

2177
01:57:15,940 --> 01:57:20,860
July of next year, they would have the digital thing to fall back on.

2178
01:57:20,860 --> 01:57:22,340
So there's that too.

2179
01:57:22,340 --> 01:57:27,980
Uh, Pixel Pacas points out this year's GDC was a few weeks ago fully online.

2180
01:57:27,980 --> 01:57:32,180
The system worked pretty well, but wasn't great for networking in my opinion, that comment

2181
01:57:32,220 --> 01:57:34,700
from our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

2182
01:57:34,700 --> 01:57:36,980
I didn't realize they even finally had it online.

2183
01:57:36,980 --> 01:57:40,520
A lot of these digital events aren't promoting very well, but then again, I'm also not the

2184
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:42,020
audience for GDC.

2185
01:57:42,020 --> 01:57:43,780
Pixel Pacas is the audience for GDC.

2186
01:57:43,780 --> 01:57:44,780
I'm not.

2187
01:57:44,780 --> 01:57:49,940
So, uh, that might be why so, um, but, uh, it's interesting a few weeks ago would be

2188
01:57:49,940 --> 01:57:52,100
around the same timeframe end of July.

2189
01:57:52,100 --> 01:58:00,980
So there is that, um, let's see, um, there will still be master classes that GDC is going

2190
01:58:00,980 --> 01:58:05,780
to do virtually for the rest of 2020, uh, they are courses that are intended to tutor

2191
01:58:05,780 --> 01:58:10,660
devs on various aspects of game design, and there'll be more info on that, uh, over the

2192
01:58:10,660 --> 01:58:11,660
coming weeks.

2193
01:58:11,660 --> 01:58:19,780
So again, GDC next year, July 19th through the 23rd, hopefully in person and online,

2194
01:58:19,780 --> 01:58:21,980
we're going to cross our fingers and our toes.

2195
01:58:21,980 --> 01:58:23,800
I can't imagine another year of this.

2196
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:28,900
I think that people are, I mean, it's already happening where people are like, I can't do

2197
01:58:28,900 --> 01:58:30,260
this quarantine thing anymore.

2198
01:58:30,260 --> 01:58:35,620
I'm just going to let go and let God and, uh, who cares who I put at risk and I that's

2199
01:58:35,620 --> 01:58:37,580
only going to get worse the longer this goes on.

2200
01:58:37,580 --> 01:58:42,420
So fingers and toes crossed that they, they have a miracle on the vaccine front.

2201
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:43,420
That's for sure.

2202
01:58:43,420 --> 01:58:44,420
All right.

2203
01:58:44,420 --> 01:58:48,300
Well, at this point, we're going to open up the chat for any topics that we might've missed

2204
01:58:48,300 --> 01:58:49,300
throughout the show.

2205
01:58:49,300 --> 01:58:53,620
I know we're a little, uh, early tonight, but that also happens, uh, when we're down

2206
01:58:53,620 --> 01:58:55,500
a host and dark soccer is not here tonight.

2207
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:59,420
Um, I will in the meantime, look to Loki to see if we have any last minute stories tonight,

2208
01:58:59,420 --> 01:59:02,780
but if you have something you want to ask or have us talk about, please go to our chat

2209
01:59:02,780 --> 01:59:05,660
over twitch.tv slash a VOG network.

2210
01:59:05,660 --> 01:59:08,060
Um, okay.

2211
01:59:08,060 --> 01:59:09,060
So let's see.

2212
01:59:09,060 --> 01:59:10,060
Yeah.

2213
01:59:10,060 --> 01:59:15,500
We've got, there's a techno attached in a drum and fun, apparently e-sports turn mode,

2214
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:20,060
uh, which is going to be launching on August 19th.

2215
01:59:20,060 --> 01:59:21,060
So that's cool.

2216
01:59:21,060 --> 01:59:23,740
Is that the PS or PS four version?

2217
01:59:23,740 --> 01:59:29,340
Uh, I don't know if that is, or it sounds like it's for the switch.

2218
01:59:29,340 --> 01:59:31,380
Oh, okay.

2219
01:59:31,380 --> 01:59:34,940
So I'm assuming in Japan, but yeah, that's pretty cool that they have like an e-sports

2220
01:59:34,940 --> 01:59:36,940
mode to that.

2221
01:59:36,940 --> 01:59:43,580
Um, let's see what else we got.

2222
01:59:43,580 --> 01:59:46,020
There is a, they're making a new GI Joe game.

2223
01:59:46,020 --> 01:59:52,460
So GI Joe operation blackout it's coming out on the PlayStation four X-Box one and switch

2224
01:59:52,460 --> 01:59:53,460
that's out of nowhere.

2225
01:59:53,460 --> 01:59:57,880
Is that going to be based off of the, the game or hopefully God, I hope they're not

2226
01:59:57,880 --> 02:00:02,320
making another movie that looks not great.

2227
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:08,840
Can I get a remake of like an NES or super NES game or arcade game?

2228
02:00:08,840 --> 02:00:10,320
I think that'd be better.

2229
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:11,320
Wow.

2230
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:15,600
This looks generic is hell actually, you know what it reminds me of?

2231
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:18,360
It reminds me of a flood, a far cry blood dragon.

2232
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:21,320
Cause it's all neon the hell out.

2233
02:00:21,320 --> 02:00:23,520
Uh, that's what it really looks like.

2234
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:27,840
That's a game we need a sequel to, uh, dark to see you in our chat over twitch.tv.

2235
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:32,960
Slash vog network says I picked up cosmic star heroin on the switch.

2236
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:34,880
It was on sale for super cheap.

2237
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:38,840
It feels heavily inspired by the square Enix classic chrono trigger.

2238
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:40,400
I highly recommend it.

2239
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:42,360
Uh, quest buster says, LOL.

2240
02:00:42,360 --> 02:00:44,680
I saw the trailer for the GI Joe game.

2241
02:00:44,680 --> 02:00:50,400
It just came out of nowhere and isn't based on anything upcoming as far as I know.

2242
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:53,240
They just want to sell more toys.

2243
02:00:53,240 --> 02:01:00,560
So I, I, uh, forwarded my wife some videos of, um, there's a, one of the, a couple like

2244
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:08,760
a YouTuber that does fake animal crossing quality of life update announcement videos.

2245
02:01:08,760 --> 02:01:09,760
Oh yeah.

2246
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:10,760
I saw it.

2247
02:01:10,760 --> 02:01:11,760
Yeah.

2248
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:12,760
Anger is the hell out of me.

2249
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:14,160
Cause I'm like, why don't they have that?

2250
02:01:14,160 --> 02:01:15,160
Oh yeah.

2251
02:01:15,160 --> 02:01:20,800
Um, there's so much like just watching her play it like, I don't know what the hell they're

2252
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:23,200
thinking sometimes with just the way to design it.

2253
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:27,080
So it's like some of the issues, like, especially like with, you know, digging a hole or something

2254
02:01:27,080 --> 02:01:31,000
like that and, you know, trying to line up the right spot in it, that's been a problem

2255
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,040
for like since the beginning.

2256
02:01:33,040 --> 02:01:34,920
And why hasn't that been fixed?

2257
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:38,760
Like some of the stuff you don't really think about because like, Oh, animal, look at all

2258
02:01:38,760 --> 02:01:42,080
the stuff that they added, but it's like, Oh my God, there's so much that could be improved

2259
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:43,080
with that.

2260
02:01:43,080 --> 02:01:45,960
There's a great, I think it's a tick talk or something like that, that Alan showed me.

2261
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:48,360
And I think he posted it on your wife's page this way too.

2262
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:49,360
I don't have Facebook anymore.

2263
02:01:49,360 --> 02:01:52,240
So no, but I think he posted it on your wife's page.

2264
02:01:52,240 --> 02:01:56,480
It was this guy and he like is like trying to aim the shovel and then he goes and knocks

2265
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:57,480
over the table.

2266
02:01:57,480 --> 02:01:58,480
I did that.

2267
02:01:58,480 --> 02:01:59,480
Yeah.

2268
02:01:59,480 --> 02:02:00,480
That's Gus Johnson.

2269
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:01,480
So yeah.

2270
02:02:01,480 --> 02:02:02,480
Okay.

2271
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:03,480
Really funny.

2272
02:02:03,480 --> 02:02:04,480
A YouTuber.

2273
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:05,480
But yeah, he did.

2274
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:07,280
He does these little short videos, but that was one day I posted on her wall.

2275
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:08,280
Um, okay.

2276
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:09,280
Okay.

2277
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:10,280
But yeah, that's hilarious.

2278
02:02:10,280 --> 02:02:15,040
And it perfectly illustrates animal crossing sometimes just because some of the things

2279
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:19,880
we're trying to do, like she's trying to build a staircase between, um, the two of

2280
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:21,420
the buildings in the game.

2281
02:02:21,420 --> 02:02:24,120
And for whatever reason, it just would not let her do it.

2282
02:02:24,120 --> 02:02:28,300
It's like, sorry, there's not enough space to, you know, I don't know, this, this cliff

2283
02:02:28,300 --> 02:02:31,160
doesn't look even enough where we're going to put stairs here.

2284
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:33,040
And it's like, right there, right there.

2285
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:35,480
It's like, why won't you work?

2286
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:40,960
Uh, um, Bobby in chat says they don't, Bobby and chat says they don't consider it broken.

2287
02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:42,000
That's why they haven't fixed it.

2288
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:47,320
Animal crossing has sold almost more than any other switch game at this point.

2289
02:02:47,320 --> 02:02:49,680
So what, what's their motivation to fix it.

2290
02:02:49,680 --> 02:02:53,400
Although we do know there is a, there's a fall update coming.

2291
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:56,200
Maybe some things will be addressed, but I'm not going to hold my breath.

2292
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:59,280
But just some quality of life stuff like in the stuff that was in those views wasn't like

2293
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:00,600
ridiculous things.

2294
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:04,580
It was like, Hey, you know why say you want to craft two of something.

2295
02:03:04,580 --> 02:03:10,880
You can select the quantity or like, how about, you know, um, the ability to see your storage

2296
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:17,760
where you're aiming, you know, just a crafting from your storage, like not ridiculous things,

2297
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:22,180
like things that I would see without having any knowledge of how they construct that game

2298
02:03:22,180 --> 02:03:24,160
that shouldn't be too hard to implement.

2299
02:03:24,160 --> 02:03:27,320
Like I get it that you're not going to be able to do everything that everybody wants,

2300
02:03:27,320 --> 02:03:31,840
but like some of this stuff is an unreasonable and when make things a little bit better.

2301
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:34,100
Let me, let me ask this related question.

2302
02:03:34,100 --> 02:03:36,320
So obviously your wife is still playing animal crossing.

2303
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:38,200
Are you.

2304
02:03:38,200 --> 02:03:44,320
I did the other day just to, um, cause I have, you know, the online access.

2305
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:46,480
So I did the download some designs.

2306
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:49,920
Unfortunately, my youngest son was the one that played the game first.

2307
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:54,960
So he is running the town and also I had to play the other day because he made my birthday

2308
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:57,320
August 9th for some reason.

2309
02:03:57,320 --> 02:04:03,040
So, um, so I had to do my birthday stuff.

2310
02:04:03,040 --> 02:04:04,600
He got the nine, right?

2311
02:04:04,600 --> 02:04:05,600
Kinda.

2312
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:09,560
It's just the month, sorta, sorta close.

2313
02:04:09,560 --> 02:04:14,320
So I had to, I had to do the, um, birthday stuff, you know, for that.

2314
02:04:14,320 --> 02:04:17,880
Um, but yeah, no, it isn't night.

2315
02:04:17,880 --> 02:04:18,880
I don't know.

2316
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:19,880
I did it, uh, today.

2317
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:23,780
Maybe when she just time traveling, I don't remember, but yeah, so I had to do the birthday

2318
02:04:23,780 --> 02:04:27,120
stuff early and, um, yeah.

2319
02:04:27,120 --> 02:04:30,060
And then the download, the patterns off the internet.

2320
02:04:30,060 --> 02:04:34,080
So we were downloading some patterns so she can trick it out and stuff.

2321
02:04:34,080 --> 02:04:38,080
But yeah, it's, I don't really play it.

2322
02:04:38,080 --> 02:04:43,640
Um, Bobby is, is putting several comments in chat, essentially, uh, summarizing, uh,

2323
02:04:43,640 --> 02:04:49,200
if you haven't seen the code is coded, then you don't know if it's easy or not to fix.

2324
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:55,440
Um, and you know, maybe, maybe Nintendo, I think the thing is people are spoiled, you

2325
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:57,800
know, and we say this a lot.

2326
02:04:57,800 --> 02:04:59,840
Perception is everything, right?

2327
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:02,840
So what you're saying, those are probably the facts.

2328
02:05:02,840 --> 02:05:08,740
You know, I, the fact they likely are the facts, but perception is everything.

2329
02:05:08,740 --> 02:05:13,440
And when other games do these quality of life things they do online in a different way or

2330
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:16,880
they do the regular updates, they do such and such thing.

2331
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:20,520
It kind of, that's why people go, well, why can't Nintendo just do it this way?

2332
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:21,920
Because other companies are doing it.

2333
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:25,760
And I'm not saying, I'm not saying I disagree with what you're saying, but it's just like

2334
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:30,040
that perception is very, very big is that other game companies do make it look easy

2335
02:05:30,040 --> 02:05:35,380
sometimes and probably because they do see the benefit in putting the resources into

2336
02:05:35,380 --> 02:05:36,380
it.

2337
02:05:36,380 --> 02:05:40,660
I, but again, I don't think everything on the wishlist, you know, there are some things

2338
02:05:40,660 --> 02:05:44,100
in there where even I'm like, well, that's going to be really hard for them to go back

2339
02:05:44,100 --> 02:05:50,040
and do, but I think there's a, there's a few things in there that again, other games made

2340
02:05:50,040 --> 02:05:53,520
it look easy, but I guess we don't really know cause we can't see Nintendo's code.

2341
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:58,160
Um, just like seeing, yeah, just seeing where you're aiming, obviously the game is doing

2342
02:05:58,160 --> 02:06:03,840
some sort of rate cast calculation for where you're aiming your shovel or whatever it is,

2343
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:06,520
item trying to put it down and stuff like that.

2344
02:06:06,520 --> 02:06:11,360
And I mean, obviously it's figuring out which space it's going in because it already knows

2345
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:15,920
when you put it down or do it, you know, dig or whatever, just show that display it.

2346
02:06:15,920 --> 02:06:20,080
I mean, I don't see why that would be a problem, but I get it.

2347
02:06:20,080 --> 02:06:21,080
I mean, that's fine.

2348
02:06:21,080 --> 02:06:22,080
Whatever they're going to do.

2349
02:06:22,080 --> 02:06:27,680
They're the aim selling well, so I guess maybe they're not motivated to improve it more like

2350
02:06:27,680 --> 02:06:28,680
that.

2351
02:06:28,680 --> 02:06:29,680
We'll see what they come up with.

2352
02:06:29,680 --> 02:06:34,160
Or we'll see what the fall update has because they, you know, there are still changes coming

2353
02:06:34,160 --> 02:06:38,320
and everything that we've gotten so far has been more of like a small event.

2354
02:06:38,320 --> 02:06:41,320
Like they've been like, they've been patching in a holiday or patching this thing, but this

2355
02:06:41,320 --> 02:06:43,480
fall event, they're kind of teasing us a bigger thing.

2356
02:06:43,480 --> 02:06:46,520
So we might, I mean, I don't want to set false expectation, I'm not going to put the bar

2357
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:51,960
too high, but we might get some of it in the fall update, maybe the low hanging fruit,

2358
02:06:51,960 --> 02:06:54,680
so to speak of this code that we can't see.

2359
02:06:54,680 --> 02:06:55,680
All right.

2360
02:06:56,680 --> 02:07:01,440
SG100Matt says Def Jam has been teasing a new or remake of Def Jam Vendetta or Fight

2361
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:02,440
for New York.

2362
02:07:02,440 --> 02:07:05,460
They tweeted out the other day that if they hit 1 million on their Twitter, they will

2363
02:07:05,460 --> 02:07:08,920
have a special announcement with a picture of Vendetta.

2364
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:09,920
Hmm.

2365
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:10,920
Interesting.

2366
02:07:10,920 --> 02:07:14,560
Pissalpaca says, did they ever post the follow up because they've had a million followers

2367
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:15,560
for days.

2368
02:07:15,560 --> 02:07:19,320
Well, we're we're waiting.

2369
02:07:19,320 --> 02:07:20,640
Probably check back Monday.

2370
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:22,200
It is the weekend after all.

2371
02:07:22,720 --> 02:07:23,720
All right.

2372
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:25,160
Any other last minute stories, Logie?

2373
02:07:25,160 --> 02:07:26,800
No, that's all I had.

2374
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:27,800
All right.

2375
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:29,720
Then I think we'll go ahead and wrap things up for the night.

2376
02:07:29,720 --> 02:07:33,960
Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show, whether you were here live or you were

2377
02:07:33,960 --> 02:07:35,240
on our podcast.

2378
02:07:35,240 --> 02:07:38,160
We really appreciate you participating with our show.

2379
02:07:38,160 --> 02:07:40,640
Send us an email, say hello to us that way.

2380
02:07:40,640 --> 02:07:42,680
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2381
02:07:42,680 --> 02:07:47,400
We're also on social media, on Twitter over at OLR.

2382
02:07:47,400 --> 02:07:50,560
And yeah, we'll be back in seven days to do this all over again.

2383
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:53,360
If you wouldn't mind helping us spread the word, we are the show where every gamer has

2384
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:54,360
a voice.

2385
02:07:54,360 --> 02:07:57,200
But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, we're missing that.

2386
02:07:57,200 --> 02:07:59,960
So tell a friend or two about the show, help us spread the word.

2387
02:07:59,960 --> 02:08:03,760
An auto host on Twitch goes a real long way.

2388
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:08,460
A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this podcast.

2389
02:08:08,460 --> 02:08:09,660
Those go a long way as well.

2390
02:08:09,660 --> 02:08:12,960
We really appreciate those word of mouth things.

2391
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:15,920
That all being said, let's wrap up and get final thoughts.

2392
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:19,040
Dark Sakura will be here next week.

2393
02:08:19,040 --> 02:08:25,320
We'll see you guys then with Jamie and whatever should happen in the industry this week.

2394
02:08:25,320 --> 02:08:28,260
Maybe we'll get some big announcements about these consoles, who knows?

2395
02:08:28,260 --> 02:08:31,480
Or maybe we'll have more reasons to come back and say, you know what, fuck you and fuck

2396
02:08:31,480 --> 02:08:32,480
you and fuck you.

2397
02:08:32,480 --> 02:08:33,760
We'll see what happens.

2398
02:08:33,760 --> 02:08:36,440
Loki, your final thought tonight?

2399
02:08:36,440 --> 02:08:43,160
I'm going to keep working on making something or learning more stuff.

2400
02:08:43,160 --> 02:08:44,160
I don't know.

2401
02:08:44,160 --> 02:08:46,200
But yeah, I'm going to keep working on stuff.

2402
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:51,440
Hopefully I made something that technically is a game, but technically it's such a short

2403
02:08:51,440 --> 02:08:55,640
following a tutorial that I don't really count that.

2404
02:08:55,640 --> 02:08:59,480
Well it's something, you got to start somewhere.

2405
02:08:59,480 --> 02:09:01,000
It's one little step.

2406
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:02,000
Yay.

2407
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:03,000
All right.

2408
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:04,000
Cool.

2409
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,240
All right.

2410
02:09:05,240 --> 02:09:06,240
My final thought.

2411
02:09:06,240 --> 02:09:07,240
I don't have a lot.

2412
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:11,400
You know, good luck to Bobby with Summer Games done quick and looking forward to Virtual

2413
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:13,760
Dragon Con as well.

2414
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:18,900
And yeah, let's just keep wearing our masks and social distance and do everything we can

2415
02:09:18,900 --> 02:09:24,680
to try to lessen the spread of COVID so we can get back to real life and events like

2416
02:09:24,680 --> 02:09:31,200
GDC and all the other things we miss where 2020 has just kind of ruined all of that.

2417
02:09:31,200 --> 02:09:36,680
And also stay cool and stay hydrated, especially those of you in California.

2418
02:09:36,680 --> 02:09:38,480
This heat wave is going to get worse.

2419
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:40,120
Tuesday is going to be real bad.

2420
02:09:40,120 --> 02:09:41,720
The number keeps going up and down.

2421
02:09:41,720 --> 02:09:46,000
It was at 114 at one point and I was like, what the fuck?

2422
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:47,200
But I think it's down to like one or nine.

2423
02:09:47,200 --> 02:09:50,920
I think this cloud and the rains and all this stuff that's happened, maybe put it down.

2424
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:53,160
But yeah, that's yikes.

2425
02:09:53,160 --> 02:09:55,520
So anyway, stay hydrated.

2426
02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:58,480
Because seriously, I was out at like eight in the morning.

2427
02:09:58,480 --> 02:10:00,200
I was doing my cemetery portal scanning.

2428
02:10:00,200 --> 02:10:05,960
I talked about a couple of weeks ago on the show and by like 930 I was done and I was

2429
02:10:05,960 --> 02:10:09,840
already feeling a little bit like, why am I just so exhausted?

2430
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:11,640
I had to drink a lot of water.

2431
02:10:11,640 --> 02:10:15,880
So yeah, I've been trying to be real good about my walking, but I'm going to take a

2432
02:10:15,880 --> 02:10:16,880
break for a few days.

2433
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:17,880
I have to.

2434
02:10:17,880 --> 02:10:19,120
It's just too damn hot.

2435
02:10:19,120 --> 02:10:21,520
So stay inside, play some video games.

2436
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:22,800
That'll be fun too.

2437
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:24,440
So we will see you next week, everybody.

2438
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:25,440
Good night.

2439
