00:00.000 --> 00:14.380
There have been various attempts at PC Bumani before, Konami Hawaii's DDRPC in the early

00:14.380 --> 00:17.280
2000s, and the more recent DDRV in your browser.

00:17.280 --> 00:20.940
But on the heels of successful launches of 2DX, Infinitas, and SoundVoltex Cloud, the

00:20.940 --> 00:22.660
next on the list is GITADORA.

00:22.660 --> 00:26.060
Now I'm waiting to hear about three conga drums becoming available.

00:26.060 --> 00:29.660
I may be slightly facetious about that, but that isn't something you'll have to constantly

00:29.660 --> 00:33.540
put up with from your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki, as they bring you

00:33.540 --> 00:37.620
the rest of tonight's news, right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.620 --> 00:47.140
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

00:47.140 --> 00:49.140
every gamer has a voice.

00:49.140 --> 00:56.060
We are back once again tonight with Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 831, for this

00:56.060 --> 00:58.780
August 9th of 2020.

00:58.780 --> 01:02.980
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined via Discord, because we're still doing the whole

01:02.980 --> 01:07.640
social distancing thing, with my co-hosts here to talk about video games and gaming

01:07.640 --> 01:11.580
news and all that, starting off with DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:11.580 --> 01:12.580
Hello.

01:12.580 --> 01:14.620
Hi, how are you?

01:14.620 --> 01:15.620
I'm okay.

01:15.620 --> 01:16.620
Good.

01:16.620 --> 01:17.620
It's good to see you.

01:17.620 --> 01:21.340
I can actually see you, thanks to the magic of Discord and the television that's over

01:21.340 --> 01:25.220
on the side here, because we do tape- I didn't do anything fancy.

01:25.220 --> 01:26.220
No wigs tonight.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.220
That's okay.

01:27.220 --> 01:28.220
That's okay.

01:28.660 --> 01:29.660
I don't have any makeup.

01:29.660 --> 01:30.660
I'm just me.

01:30.660 --> 01:31.660
You're just a natural tonight.

01:31.660 --> 01:32.660
Normal girl.

01:32.660 --> 01:33.660
Which is all good.

01:33.660 --> 01:34.660
Normal girl.

01:34.660 --> 01:35.660
Normal girl.

01:35.660 --> 01:38.700
Because we do tape live, if you want to see the video, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock

01:38.700 --> 01:42.460
Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, over at the Voice of

01:42.460 --> 01:46.500
Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:46.500 --> 01:51.780
And for those of you that do tune in on Twitch, you might notice there's a few things that

01:51.780 --> 01:53.460
have changed around a little bit.

01:53.460 --> 01:56.800
Number one, I don't have hair anymore, or a hat.

01:56.800 --> 02:02.240
I had my Britney Spears 2006 moment this week, and I just shaved my head.

02:02.240 --> 02:04.240
I was like, you know what?

02:04.240 --> 02:05.240
Why not?

02:05.240 --> 02:06.320
Quarantine's the time to do it.

02:06.320 --> 02:07.360
So I did it.

02:07.360 --> 02:10.680
And so I thought I'd show it off tonight, because some folks were saying, I don't know,

02:10.680 --> 02:11.680
I'm still getting used to it.

02:11.680 --> 02:12.680
I don't know if I love it.

02:12.680 --> 02:15.200
But some folks on Instagram were like, no, it's a good look.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.200
It's good.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.200
So I'm like, all right, whatever.

02:17.200 --> 02:18.200
We'll try it.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.200
So here I am.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.600
And I have this mic stand here.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.200
So I don't know what to do with my hands.

02:23.200 --> 02:26.920
For the first time in 18 years, I don't know what to do with my hands, because I'm not

02:26.920 --> 02:28.880
holding a microphone.

02:28.880 --> 02:31.000
Instead, I have this mic stand.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.880
And this mic stand was donated by DJ Rama S, our pal over at Anime Jam Session, which

02:36.880 --> 02:39.160
is Tuesday nights here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

02:39.160 --> 02:41.160
A big, big thank you to Rama.

02:41.160 --> 02:45.220
I've kind of resisted the mic stand thing for a long time, just because, well, the way

02:45.220 --> 02:48.360
we've always done it is with the handheld mics, and it works fine.

02:48.360 --> 02:50.460
But you know what?

02:51.020 --> 02:53.780
I need to learn to embrace change a little more.

02:53.780 --> 02:57.660
Because maybe I would have got on the Twitch train sooner if I'd done that, or what have

02:57.660 --> 02:58.660
you.

02:58.660 --> 03:00.420
So if the listeners are like, get a mic stand, then fine.

03:00.420 --> 03:01.420
I will try.

03:01.420 --> 03:02.660
I will try the mic stand.

03:02.660 --> 03:04.100
But I don't know what to do with my hands.

03:04.100 --> 03:08.540
So I might just kind of like have them in the little scared all night or something.

03:08.540 --> 03:09.540
I don't know.

03:09.540 --> 03:11.220
I don't know what to do.

03:11.220 --> 03:13.660
Any suggestions what I should do with my hands, DarkSakura?

03:13.660 --> 03:14.660
Para-para.

03:14.660 --> 03:15.660
Oh, I could.

03:15.660 --> 03:19.100
Maybe if we could play some music, we could do that.

03:19.100 --> 03:20.100
All right.

03:20.740 --> 03:23.980
Let me turn to Tech Master Loki to see if there's any suggestions on what to do with

03:23.980 --> 03:24.980
the hands.

03:24.980 --> 03:25.980
Hi, Loki.

03:25.980 --> 03:27.660
Just do nothing.

03:27.660 --> 03:29.780
I don't know.

03:29.780 --> 03:31.740
Just keep them out of frame.

03:31.740 --> 03:32.740
All right.

03:32.740 --> 03:33.740
Yes.

03:33.740 --> 03:34.740
I will put them down by my sides.

03:34.740 --> 03:35.740
Sit on them.

03:35.740 --> 03:36.740
Okay.

03:36.740 --> 03:37.740
Sit on my hands.

03:37.740 --> 03:38.740
That's fine.

03:38.740 --> 03:39.740
There you go.

03:39.740 --> 03:40.740
Yeah.

03:40.740 --> 03:47.860
DJ Rama S. in our chat room says, your hands are free to hold two adult beverages.

03:47.860 --> 03:48.860
Yeah.

03:49.540 --> 03:50.700
That is true.

03:50.700 --> 03:53.500
And then I also switched out the microphone to a different one.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.940
So hopefully all the sound is still good and all that.

03:55.940 --> 03:57.500
But I think this will work out fine.

03:57.500 --> 04:00.380
I'm into it.

04:00.380 --> 04:02.980
No one special in our chat says, got to say it.

04:02.980 --> 04:03.980
Leave Rob alone.

04:03.980 --> 04:04.980
Well, you know what?

04:04.980 --> 04:06.660
Here's the reality.

04:06.660 --> 04:12.540
I'm 42 years old and God was already making me bald.

04:12.540 --> 04:16.900
And I'm very against using like products and stuff that kind of prey on those insecurities

04:16.940 --> 04:20.780
because if this is the way our maker made us, then whatever, right?

04:20.780 --> 04:23.500
But I just decided, you know what?

04:23.500 --> 04:27.660
Let's just try this, even though I kind of liked having what little hair I did.

04:27.660 --> 04:28.660
I don't know.

04:28.660 --> 04:30.020
The bald thing's growing on me.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.100
It'll be all right.

04:31.100 --> 04:33.580
And some folks in chat are making Hitman jokes.

04:33.580 --> 04:34.580
So sure.

04:34.580 --> 04:35.580
I could do that as a cosplay.

04:35.580 --> 04:36.900
Next Dragon Con.

04:36.900 --> 04:37.900
I'll dress up as Hitman.

04:37.900 --> 04:38.900
I don't know.

04:38.900 --> 04:40.900
All right.

04:40.900 --> 04:41.900
Let's see.

04:41.900 --> 04:42.900
Other comments in chat.

04:42.900 --> 04:46.420
SSJ100Matt says, waiting for someone to suggest for him to hold Smush.

04:46.420 --> 04:51.460
Well, if Smush will come in here and sit in the basket, I'll be happy to, but he's been

04:51.460 --> 04:53.020
kind of keeping to himself.

04:53.020 --> 04:58.220
Mr. Smush, instead of sitting in the basket, he has a new box lid in the hallway and that

04:58.220 --> 04:59.500
is his favorite thing in the world.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.700
It's his new little bed.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.640
He's slept in it all week long.

05:02.640 --> 05:04.300
He loves the box lid.

05:04.300 --> 05:08.700
And the greatest thing about the box lid is it actually says on the side of it, delicious.

05:08.700 --> 05:13.540
So when he's laying on the bed, it looks like he's, all right, forget it.

05:13.540 --> 05:16.200
SSJ100Matt says you can still cosplay as Sami Zayn.

05:16.200 --> 05:17.540
He also has a shaved head now.

05:17.540 --> 05:18.540
Oh, that's good.

05:18.540 --> 05:22.600
I still have the WrestleMania shirt and all that stuff that I wore at that one Dragon

05:22.600 --> 05:23.600
Con.

05:23.600 --> 05:24.600
So there was that.

05:24.600 --> 05:25.980
So, all right.

05:25.980 --> 05:30.020
Anyhow, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight because believe it or not, we do talk about

05:30.020 --> 05:32.220
video games once in a while here on this show.

05:32.220 --> 05:35.480
Let's talk about what happened at the State of Play this week.

05:35.480 --> 05:41.560
So Sony did like a little direct of sorts, if you want to kind of copy Nintendo Direct

05:41.560 --> 05:44.440
style, which is everybody's doing these days.

05:44.440 --> 05:47.640
PlayStation did their own direct, but they were very clear in advance.

05:47.640 --> 05:49.600
No PlayStation 5 info.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.600
This is...

05:50.600 --> 05:54.280
Which means people were immediately disappointed because no one reads those or they expect

05:54.280 --> 05:57.920
surprises just like that last Nintendo Direct where they said, listen, it's only going to

05:57.920 --> 05:59.600
focus on third party titles.

05:59.600 --> 06:02.280
Like why you didn't announce a new Metroid or F-Zero?

06:02.280 --> 06:03.280
What the heck?

06:03.480 --> 06:05.880
Did we or did we not get Godfall though?

06:05.880 --> 06:08.760
So there was a PlayStation 5 thing that snuck in there, wasn't there?

06:08.760 --> 06:13.000
Yeah, but Godfall has been like, they've shown Godfall like several times and it's kind of

06:13.000 --> 06:14.180
boring looking.

06:14.180 --> 06:15.180
I don't...

06:15.180 --> 06:18.220
Am I the only one that doesn't hate Godfall?

06:18.220 --> 06:19.480
Like what I've seen of it?

06:19.480 --> 06:20.480
Like I get...

06:20.480 --> 06:22.200
They don't hate it, I'm just indifferent.

06:22.200 --> 06:27.200
Yeah, I get where people are like, this is kind of like, I look like I've seen this before.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.740
What's so PlayStation 5 about this?

06:29.740 --> 06:30.740
But I don't know.

06:30.740 --> 06:32.520
It looks like a game I might try.

06:32.520 --> 06:36.360
I don't hate it the way the rest of the internet does, but that's, that's how I often feel

06:36.360 --> 06:37.360
about video games these days.

06:37.360 --> 06:39.920
I don't hate it, but it doesn't look interesting to me.

06:39.920 --> 06:40.920
I don't know.

06:40.920 --> 06:41.920
All right.

06:41.920 --> 06:42.920
Fair enough.

06:42.920 --> 06:43.920
Well, what else?

06:43.920 --> 06:44.920
This looks very generic.

06:44.920 --> 06:49.360
Um, so they had a few other trailers, so there's one that I've actually seen quite a few times

06:49.360 --> 06:53.720
with The Pedestrian, which is kind of a platformer game that takes place in Street Science.

06:53.720 --> 06:56.640
That's kind of neat.

06:56.640 --> 07:00.080
There is a new expansion for Control.

07:00.640 --> 07:05.040
Uh, the, is it AWE or AWE, I guess, which is coming out at the end of this month.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.560
The Alan Wake expansion.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.560
Eh, whatever.

07:07.560 --> 07:08.560
Okay.

07:08.560 --> 07:11.840
So the Alan Wake expansion, yeah, that's going to be coming out at the end of the month.

07:11.840 --> 07:14.000
If you're a Remedy fan, that's a pretty big deal.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.920
Like Alan Wake was a game a lot of people slept on unnecessarily and it was really good.

07:18.920 --> 07:21.840
Um, and to be fair, I'm sleeping on Control still.

07:21.840 --> 07:24.360
I just haven't gotten around to playing it, but I really need to.

07:24.360 --> 07:28.600
Like Remedy always has put out, uh, quality products.

07:28.600 --> 07:31.680
Game Break, a lot of people slept on too, and that was a really good game.

07:31.680 --> 07:37.280
So I, I don't, yeah, I don't know what's happening, why people keep, uh, uh, sleeping on the Remedy

07:37.280 --> 07:39.700
stuff, but I want to check out Control for sure.

07:39.700 --> 07:44.400
We got some gameplay footage of Bugsnax, which was interesting.

07:44.400 --> 07:48.360
Yeah, it's like, it's like a first person ape escape, right?

07:48.360 --> 07:49.440
Sort of, yeah.

07:49.440 --> 07:54.680
And then, uh, they announced that Star Wars Vader Immortal is coming to, uh, PlayStation

07:54.680 --> 07:57.420
VR, which makes sense, I guess.

07:57.420 --> 08:02.580
I think that came out originally on the Quest, so it's, you know, it's cool that it's coming

08:02.580 --> 08:03.580
to other platforms.

08:03.580 --> 08:09.620
Uh, Spelunky 2's got a date on the PlayStation 15th, and on the September 15th, it's coming

08:09.620 --> 08:10.740
out on PlayStation 4.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.380
That was a pleasant surprise.

08:12.380 --> 08:14.580
I was really happy to hear that Spelunky 2 is a thing.

08:14.580 --> 08:18.380
I mean, of course it's a thing, but I feel like, you know, Spelunky's been out, God,

08:18.380 --> 08:19.800
that game's been out at least five years.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.340
That goes back probably longer.

08:21.340 --> 08:27.140
It goes back to the early days of the PlayStation 4, and I really feel like that game, like,

08:27.140 --> 08:31.100
kind of like a lot of stuff came after it that really invokes Spelunky.

08:31.100 --> 08:34.500
I don't know if that's just the roguelike thing, you know, like every roguelike feels

08:34.500 --> 08:37.900
like it has some similarities, but I feel like Spelunky really kind of paved the way

08:37.900 --> 08:42.020
of sorts, so it's nice to see it getting, like, an official sequel.

08:42.020 --> 08:46.940
And talking about, like, old games coming, old indie games coming back, but apparently

08:46.940 --> 08:51.620
there's an anniversary edition of Braid being made for the PlayStation 5.

08:51.620 --> 08:55.660
I believe, actually, it's also coming out on other platforms as well, but that's coming

08:55.660 --> 09:01.660
out early 2021, so yeah, they're going to release that on pretty much all the platforms.

09:01.660 --> 09:07.780
I like how it's just Braid Anniversary Edition, because if I am doing my math right, that

09:07.780 --> 09:15.540
game originally came out in 2008, I believe, so that game is 12 years old, so it's not

09:15.540 --> 09:22.380
really the 10th anniversary or the 15th anniversary, it's just an anniversary.

09:22.380 --> 09:23.780
Right.

09:23.780 --> 09:30.220
And then they announced, along with Hitman 3, there's going to be a VR portion of that

09:30.220 --> 09:34.060
as well, so it's going to have a VR mode, which apparently allows you to play missions

09:34.060 --> 09:38.820
from the entire trilogy, so that's kind of cool.

09:38.820 --> 09:42.060
Crash Bandicoot 4, they showed some more gameplay with that, and talk a little bit about that

09:42.060 --> 09:48.820
as well, and it's a direct sequel to Crash Bandicoot Warped, and it looked kind of cool.

09:48.820 --> 09:49.820
What else?

09:49.820 --> 09:55.780
The pathless being shown, so they kind of did a little bit of a gameplay walkthrough

09:55.780 --> 09:57.780
of that.

09:57.780 --> 10:09.020
Let's see, a game called Genshi Impact, and Anno, I don't even know, Mutationim, I guess,

10:09.020 --> 10:13.780
that's going to be coming out on PlayStation 4 at the end of the year there.

10:13.780 --> 10:22.100
And Pele Hanomeo says DLC for Outer Worlds due out this month, but didn't the Xbox series

10:22.100 --> 10:25.620
have that, or maybe they probably didn't date it in the Xbox announcement, but I feel like

10:25.620 --> 10:26.620
it was...

10:26.620 --> 10:32.100
Oh, the Outer Worlds, yeah, I don't think they dated it, no, I don't think it said when

10:32.100 --> 10:33.100
it was.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.100
So now they dated it.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.100
Got it.

10:35.100 --> 10:39.540
And then I know this one was something I saw on PC at one point, but apparently Temtem,

10:39.540 --> 10:45.540
which is kind of a Pokemon clone, is coming to PlayStation 5 next year as well.

10:45.540 --> 10:48.660
That's subtly kind of a big deal, I think.

10:48.660 --> 10:53.860
I know that's a weird way to phrase it, but I think the fact that Temtem has gotten big

10:53.860 --> 10:58.860
enough that it's justifying a PlayStation release to really kind of take on...

10:58.860 --> 11:04.660
I don't want to say take on, but really respond to maybe one of Nintendo's biggest franchises.

11:04.660 --> 11:06.780
I think that's kind of a big deal.

11:07.740 --> 11:12.220
Yeah, and then they showed God of Fall, and then of course there was another announcement,

11:12.220 --> 11:18.420
Hood Outlaw and Legends, which is a medieval PlayStation 5 game coming out next year.

11:18.420 --> 11:22.120
And Auto Chess, apparently there was a trailer for that as well.

11:22.120 --> 11:27.740
So Act F is in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network and is clarifying that the

11:27.740 --> 11:30.420
Temtem release on PlayStation 5 was a Kickstarter goal.

11:30.420 --> 11:31.420
I didn't...

11:31.420 --> 11:33.900
Thank you for clarifying, because I didn't follow that Kickstarter, so I didn't know

11:33.900 --> 11:35.900
that they'd already promised their releases on console.

11:35.900 --> 11:40.340
I still find it interesting, you know, for something that's essentially a Pokemon clone,

11:40.340 --> 11:46.580
to which Act F says it is a Pokemon clone, but it has fallen off, quite off the radar.

11:46.580 --> 11:47.580
I thought it...

11:47.580 --> 11:50.540
Didn't it have some like weird bumps in the road when it came out on PC?

11:50.540 --> 11:55.420
Like I don't want to make stuff up, but I feel like it had like a rough kind of launch

11:55.420 --> 11:56.420
week.

11:56.420 --> 12:00.140
I'm not sure.

12:00.140 --> 12:05.320
Act F clarifies it's early access, so well then problems are to be expected, I suppose.

12:05.320 --> 12:10.120
And then one other confirmation that came out of that as well is that, talking about

12:10.120 --> 12:12.720
backwards compatibility with some of the peripherals.

12:12.720 --> 12:17.200
So they said that basically Arcade 6 and other specialty peripherals will work with PlayStation

12:17.200 --> 12:24.840
5 titles, but DualShock 4, those controllers are only going to be compatible with PlayStation

12:24.840 --> 12:25.840
4 games.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.460
So it's kind of disappointing.

12:27.460 --> 12:32.280
I'm surprised though that that's going to be the case, you know, considering that there

12:32.280 --> 12:39.600
was that extra two back button add-on that they had for the PlayStation 4 DualShocks.

12:39.600 --> 12:44.480
I'm wondering if maybe that's going to add some sort of compatibility with PlayStation

12:44.480 --> 12:48.280
5 games as well, or maybe not, I don't know.

12:48.280 --> 12:53.600
It's hard to say, but has PlayStation ever done the upwards compatibility?

12:53.600 --> 12:57.600
Like the three controllers don't work on a four and twos don't work on a three, so I'm

12:57.600 --> 12:58.600
not...

12:58.600 --> 13:03.480
Yes, they did on the PlayStation 1 controllers, those DualShocks worked on the PlayStation

13:03.480 --> 13:04.480
2.

13:04.480 --> 13:05.480
Okay.

13:05.480 --> 13:11.240
The only downside for that is it may not work necessarily perfectly because the PlayStation

13:11.240 --> 13:18.040
2 face buttons were analog versus digital buttons that were on the PlayStation 1 DualShock

13:18.040 --> 13:19.040
controller.

13:19.040 --> 13:23.320
So for example, I think like Gran Turismo and some of those games actually responded

13:23.320 --> 13:26.880
to how hard you push on the buttons on those.

13:26.880 --> 13:31.120
So that was really the only difference, but I don't think there's that many games that

13:31.120 --> 13:32.120
use that.

13:32.120 --> 13:36.160
And honestly, I used to use my PlayStation 1 DualShock controllers all the time with

13:36.160 --> 13:38.460
PlayStation 2 games and never knows from.

13:38.460 --> 13:43.720
So yeah, that was probably the only time that they had like forward compatibility.

13:43.720 --> 13:46.840
And I guess if you count the PlayStation Move controllers, because they just haven't come

13:46.840 --> 13:50.360
up with something better yet, but that's about the only thing.

13:50.360 --> 13:53.120
Fifth Dream in chat says, consoles come with controllers.

13:53.120 --> 13:54.120
This is fake outrage.

13:54.120 --> 13:56.680
I don't know if I'd go so far as say fake outrage.

13:57.360 --> 14:02.320
I would put it in the category of awe bummer, like, oh, bummer, but it's not a deal breaker

14:02.320 --> 14:03.320
for me because you're right.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.360
I'm going to get a controller with the system anyway.

14:05.360 --> 14:14.520
And it's still a point of contention because you look at like the Xbox One and the Xbox

14:14.520 --> 14:19.440
Series X, the Xbox Series X is backwards compatible with the Xbox One controllers.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.400
You can use those on that system.

14:21.400 --> 14:26.120
So that is something like I know for if you're just playing single player, that's probably

14:26.120 --> 14:28.320
not a big deal because yes, it does come with a controller.

14:28.320 --> 14:32.100
But like, if you're like me, I bought controllers for my entire family.

14:32.100 --> 14:35.680
So that's four controllers I have to replace, assuming I was going to do that probably wouldn't.

14:35.680 --> 14:40.560
But you know, let's say that was, you know, that is an additional expense that I need

14:40.560 --> 14:43.560
to spend money on.

14:43.560 --> 14:49.120
Because if I want to replace that, have that same type of gameplay, then I need to buy

14:49.120 --> 14:52.560
additional controllers, which, you know, hopefully aren't going to be too expensive.

14:52.560 --> 14:56.880
But it's still something like that you're gonna have additional controllers lying around

14:56.880 --> 14:57.880
as well.

14:57.880 --> 14:59.640
It would be nice if they work with it.

14:59.640 --> 15:00.640
Yeah.

15:00.640 --> 15:01.640
But whatever.

15:01.640 --> 15:05.720
That's yeah, that's where my head is that is like, oh, it's nice when it happens that

15:05.720 --> 15:06.720
way.

15:06.720 --> 15:10.760
But it didn't, you know, oh, well, usually they don't like it's more often than not,

15:10.760 --> 15:13.400
they don't work upwards.

15:13.400 --> 15:14.400
So right.

15:14.400 --> 15:19.240
And it can make sense to because I, you know, when you look at the Xbox games, you know,

15:19.240 --> 15:23.320
the Series X, a lot of most of those games are going to launch, you know, on both the

15:23.320 --> 15:28.560
Xbox One and on the Xbox Series X.

15:28.560 --> 15:32.780
So they have to have that compatibility between the two because they're going to be on both

15:32.780 --> 15:35.320
of those platforms at the same time.

15:35.320 --> 15:36.600
Whereas Sony doesn't have that.

15:36.600 --> 15:40.620
And there's additional functionality in those controllers that they can't necessarily do

15:40.620 --> 15:44.040
without it, we kind of break those games if it didn't have it in there.

15:44.040 --> 15:48.500
So I understand it, it's just kind of kind of sucks.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.780
But it's not like it's a bummer bummer.

15:50.780 --> 15:51.780
That's it.

15:51.780 --> 15:54.540
Yeah, it's kind of like, oh, yeah, wish it wasn't like that.

15:54.540 --> 15:57.500
But I also feel like, you know, it'll be offset.

15:57.500 --> 16:01.900
You know, Sony hasn't revealed all the secrets of the controller in the system and everything

16:01.900 --> 16:02.900
yet.

16:02.900 --> 16:06.540
You know, we know there's this thing that the jump right in the game and the potential

16:06.540 --> 16:10.200
to have like shortcuts and things now obviously doesn't speak to the controller.

16:10.200 --> 16:14.460
But my point is, there are things about this system that are still under lock and key.

16:14.460 --> 16:18.300
And I think the full secrets of that controller is one of them.

16:18.300 --> 16:21.480
So maybe it will make more sense once we know all those secrets.

16:21.480 --> 16:26.140
So I'm that's why I'm kind of like, I'm not like, okay, like, oh, bummer, that would be

16:26.140 --> 16:31.000
that would have been cool if it weren't and they do they do work for the backwards compatibility.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.320
So there is that I'm still like, all right, so.

16:34.320 --> 16:35.320
And that's fine.

16:35.320 --> 16:36.740
It works for what it needs to work for.

16:36.740 --> 16:40.820
I kind of feel like I even though I don't know all of what the controller can do, I

16:40.820 --> 16:44.900
kind of feel like it's just going to be basically copying the switch controllers.

16:44.900 --> 16:47.960
I think that's just going to be in hand tactics.

16:47.960 --> 16:48.960
Just like that.

16:48.960 --> 16:49.960
It's like, look, it's so amazing.

16:49.960 --> 16:50.960
It's so new.

16:50.960 --> 16:53.340
It's like, well, this is exactly what we have on the switch.

16:53.340 --> 16:56.660
You know, it's saying it's, it's unique.

16:56.660 --> 16:57.660
Kind of did that with the move controllers.

16:57.660 --> 16:58.980
Oh, it's a unique thing.

16:58.980 --> 17:01.980
We're not copying the Wiimotes, no, not at all.

17:01.980 --> 17:02.980
Let's see what happens.

17:02.980 --> 17:03.980
There's still going to be more.

17:03.980 --> 17:07.340
I mean, obviously, we know Microsoft has got another event that they're going to have to

17:07.340 --> 17:08.860
do probably in August.

17:08.860 --> 17:12.600
And I imagine Sony's going to need to do the same thing also in August, which is the month

17:12.600 --> 17:13.600
that we're in right now.

17:13.600 --> 17:19.040
So I imagine maybe sometime around like Labor Day-ish, we'll probably get some dueling announcements.

17:19.040 --> 17:21.840
Something a little bit late breaking here, by the way, it's not on our show roll, but

17:21.840 --> 17:25.160
something I picked up on Twitter, actually, that was posted to our Discord just minutes

17:25.160 --> 17:27.120
before we went live tonight.

17:27.120 --> 17:34.760
But apparently a leak has confirmed the existence of an Xbox Series S in addition to the Xbox

17:34.760 --> 17:35.760
Series X.

17:35.760 --> 17:39.820
And what that leak is, apparently a box for one of the controllers came out and it actually

17:39.820 --> 17:42.760
lists the Xbox Series S under it.

17:42.760 --> 17:46.280
Now, you still have to take these sort of things with a grain of salt because we know

17:46.280 --> 17:49.960
people have gone so far as to Photoshop like boxes and things like that before because

17:49.960 --> 17:50.960
people are crazy.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.960
Well, they have an actual controller, though.

17:52.960 --> 17:56.880
And actually, it's like a retail version of the Xbox.

17:56.880 --> 18:01.320
This one definitely seems to hold some water compared to some other things we've seen before.

18:01.320 --> 18:05.680
But again, the Twitter fake a couple weeks ago with the F-Zero thing and all that, that

18:05.680 --> 18:06.680
was a pretty good fake, too.

18:06.680 --> 18:10.040
Well, but that's a more disappointing thing, though, still.

18:10.040 --> 18:16.640
Dude, we're in the year 2020, going into 2021, and we're still using two AA batteries for

18:16.640 --> 18:17.640
the Xbox controllers.

18:17.640 --> 18:21.120
Come on, can we please get some rechargeable batteries, please?

18:21.120 --> 18:23.360
Come on, is it going to be so difficult?

18:23.360 --> 18:28.720
We've had it for two generations already for the PlayStation.

18:28.720 --> 18:32.840
I understand that sometimes those batteries go bad and you have to replace the whole thing,

18:32.840 --> 18:36.080
but come on.

18:36.080 --> 18:42.360
I think it should be able to be done already, I guess, to keep the costs down, but I don't

18:42.360 --> 18:43.360
know.

18:43.360 --> 18:47.560
Looking at some comments in chat regarding that Xbox Series S I just talked about, DJ

18:47.560 --> 18:49.920
Rama S says, wasn't that leak confirmed months ago?

18:49.920 --> 18:52.560
And Bobby Blackwell says, well, I thought that was Lockhart.

18:52.560 --> 18:55.320
Yeah, there's been the word.

18:55.320 --> 18:59.400
This is not a huge surprise because, yes, the rumors have been out there that there's

18:59.400 --> 19:03.160
this other thing they're working on, Lockhart, and it's another console that falls into the

19:03.160 --> 19:08.000
Xbox Series S or Xbox Series line.

19:08.000 --> 19:13.360
So people are wondering, is S like their discless version of the X?

19:13.360 --> 19:16.960
We don't really know what it all entails, but it does seem to be it's going to be a

19:16.960 --> 19:21.000
cheaper offering and how they're going to get under PlayStation 5.

19:21.000 --> 19:27.020
If I were to guess, it's going to be a redesign of the Xbox One right now, that generation

19:27.020 --> 19:33.500
of console put into the form factor of the Xbox One Series X, kind of like how they redid

19:33.500 --> 19:38.460
the Xbox 360 at one time to kind of make it a little bit smaller.

19:38.460 --> 19:43.700
I could see it something like that because, I don't know, or maybe not.

19:43.700 --> 19:45.940
I'm curious to see what Microsoft presents.

19:45.940 --> 19:51.920
I do feel like I will myself will probably get a Series X just because I'm a little more

19:51.920 --> 19:55.620
of a, I guess, hardcore, I don't like to call myself a hardcore gamer because I'm not very

19:55.620 --> 19:56.620
good at games.

19:56.620 --> 19:58.260
I just really enjoy them.

19:58.260 --> 19:59.500
So I'm a core gamer.

19:59.500 --> 20:04.060
I'm just a medium core gamer.

20:04.060 --> 20:10.260
And I feel like I'll get an Xbox Series X just because it is the more, you know, it's

20:10.260 --> 20:16.740
why I get the nicer iPhone and not the, usually they put out like a more affordable model

20:16.740 --> 20:19.800
that's kind of like last year's specs.

20:19.800 --> 20:24.460
And that's cool for the people that want that, but I want the fanciest one.

20:24.460 --> 20:29.900
So I'll probably end up going with that for Xbox Series X.

20:29.900 --> 20:30.900
We'll see.

20:30.900 --> 20:37.060
I'm curious what they're doing and what their strategy is overall, that's for sure.

20:37.060 --> 20:40.800
And how they're kind of responding to the PlayStation 5 because that competition, even

20:40.800 --> 20:46.380
though I don't like the fanboy wars, I don't like the whole PlayStation versus Xbox and

20:46.380 --> 20:49.500
the way that people behave on Twitter sometimes, I don't care for that.

20:49.500 --> 20:53.500
But just as a fan of gaming and that competition where they're kind of challenging each other

20:53.540 --> 20:55.900
to do better, that I like.

20:55.900 --> 21:02.780
And so I'm curious to see how the Xbox Series X kind of needles Sony, if nothing else.

21:02.780 --> 21:04.300
I'm very curious about that.

21:04.300 --> 21:10.220
DJRoma S says, the Xbox Series S is a smaller, less powerful version of the Series X, but

21:10.220 --> 21:15.300
more powerful than the Xbox One S. Yeah, that's kind of, again, kind of what we're hearing

21:15.300 --> 21:18.020
is that it's probably going to be a little more like an Xbox One, but something with

21:18.020 --> 21:23.300
a little more oomph they can play the games a little better, but probably not a disk drive.

21:23.300 --> 21:27.340
It's probably one thing that we can guarantee won't be in it, but we really don't know shit

21:27.340 --> 21:30.460
until Microsoft has their official unveiling.

21:30.460 --> 21:33.180
But maybe this is going to motivate them to get that done faster.

21:33.180 --> 21:34.180
I don't know.

21:34.180 --> 21:35.180
We'll see.

21:35.180 --> 21:36.180
All right.

21:36.180 --> 21:39.340
Well, is that it for the state of play?

21:39.340 --> 21:40.340
Is that everything?

21:40.340 --> 21:41.340
What'd you think overall?

21:41.340 --> 21:42.780
What'd you think overall?

21:42.780 --> 21:45.480
I skimmed through because I forgot that it was on.

21:45.480 --> 21:49.000
I had like meetings during that time, you know, work stuff.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.460
And so I forgot that it was started.

21:50.820 --> 21:54.340
And so I had to kind of skim through it to catch up to the actual live stream.

21:54.340 --> 21:55.700
So I was all right.

21:55.700 --> 21:59.700
There's just some things like I didn't care to see trailers for, but like, it's fine.

21:59.700 --> 22:02.700
It's not for just me.

22:02.700 --> 22:05.220
There wasn't any like huge surprises.

22:05.220 --> 22:07.460
It was just kind of, it was what it was.

22:07.460 --> 22:12.140
I think it worked nice as a bridge between the two PlayStation 5 events, especially when

22:12.140 --> 22:14.460
it comes to PlayStation VR.

22:14.460 --> 22:18.500
Because I don't know if you remember when we were talking about that PlayStation 5 event,

22:18.540 --> 22:22.660
I kind of commented, I was like, you know, for all that talk about how the PlayStation

22:22.660 --> 22:26.740
VR will work with the PlayStation 5, they didn't really show anything when it comes

22:26.740 --> 22:29.420
to PlayStation 5 VR and how it works there.

22:29.420 --> 22:33.620
Still don't know like what exactly, I mean, I don't know if they have new hardware coming

22:33.620 --> 22:34.620
out for that yet.

22:34.620 --> 22:36.220
Probably not this year, I'd imagine.

22:36.220 --> 22:37.220
We don't.

22:37.220 --> 22:43.940
But the fact that VR is still being supported well enough to necessitate a Star Wars game,

22:43.940 --> 22:47.460
which is a pretty, I mean, then again, Kinect got a Star Wars game too.

22:47.500 --> 22:52.500
It's technically a port, it came out on the Oculus Quest, I want to say.

22:52.500 --> 22:57.940
It's still a new release and it still is something to, you know, inject life into the PlayStation

22:57.940 --> 23:03.700
VR that says to me, yes, Sony is still pushing this forward, but we'll see what comes of

23:03.700 --> 23:05.060
it on PlayStation 5.

23:05.060 --> 23:10.780
Because for all we know right now, the PlayStation 5 VR will be nothing but backwards compatibility.

23:10.780 --> 23:11.900
That's all we know.

23:11.900 --> 23:13.940
But I don't think that really is going to be the case.

23:13.940 --> 23:16.500
I think we will see some 5 stuff.

23:16.540 --> 23:17.540
We don't know it yet.

23:17.540 --> 23:18.540
Yeah.

23:18.540 --> 23:22.700
I don't think, I think what you'll see is you'll see a look, hopefully a bump in the

23:22.700 --> 23:27.980
performance of it, maybe even like the visuals, depending if the hardware is, you know, more

23:27.980 --> 23:30.340
powerful, assuming they come out with new hardware.

23:30.340 --> 23:35.540
Kind of like it was a minor bump when you have the PlayStation 4 Pro versus the regular

23:35.540 --> 23:42.180
PlayStation 4 in VR, you got some, you know, better definition in the graphics and some

23:42.180 --> 23:45.580
frame rates were a little bit better and there's a little bit more detail in there as well.

23:45.580 --> 23:50.900
So I'm hoping a little bit of a jump from that and, you know, being able to run those

23:50.900 --> 23:55.740
games a little bit better, hopefully see some more immersive games and hopefully with their

23:55.740 --> 24:01.140
improved haptics that they have in the DualShock 5, that they will add that to whatever they

24:01.140 --> 24:04.380
come up with that hopefully is way better than the PlayStation Move controllers because

24:04.380 --> 24:08.380
God, they're so old.

24:08.380 --> 24:09.620
Let me read this comment from chat.

24:09.620 --> 24:14.140
Fifth Dream over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network says, trying to sell some last minute VR units

24:14.140 --> 24:15.780
before they drop it like a Vita.

24:15.780 --> 24:20.060
I don't, I realize, um, everybody, you know, likes to give Sony a hard time with dropping

24:20.060 --> 24:22.120
hardware because they don't have a great track record.

24:22.120 --> 24:26.360
So it's a fair criticism, but I don't see them dropping VR anytime soon.

24:26.360 --> 24:31.160
Number one, them reaffirming support for it on the PlayStation 5 is a big deal.

24:31.160 --> 24:34.100
You'll notice they didn't say shit about the Vita and the PlayStation 5.

24:34.100 --> 24:36.580
We don't even know if you can charge a Vita on a PlayStation 5.

24:36.580 --> 24:41.140
So you know, but in all seriousness, when it comes to PlayStation VR, one big difference

24:41.140 --> 24:45.760
between PlayStation VR and PlayStation Vita is that PlayStation VR and correct me if I'm

24:45.760 --> 24:50.060
wrong and Bobby's in chat, so I'm sure he will say something, but PlayStation VR is

24:50.060 --> 24:52.460
the most successful VR headset.

24:52.460 --> 24:53.460
It is.

24:53.460 --> 24:56.020
They have sold more PlayStation VRs than they sold anything else.

24:56.020 --> 24:59.980
Now, granted, when it comes to PC, that market is a little more splintered because you get

24:59.980 --> 25:02.700
the vibe over here, the Oculus over here and so on.

25:02.700 --> 25:05.260
PlayStation VR is a much more of like, kind of like this baseline thing.

25:05.260 --> 25:10.320
There is just that headset for Sony and it's a great entry level VR thing.

25:10.320 --> 25:13.920
And Vita was never the number one selling handheld and never got there.

25:13.920 --> 25:16.160
Never even got close.

25:16.160 --> 25:20.400
And I think some of that is Sony's own mistakes, but that's a conversation for another time.

25:20.400 --> 25:26.000
I just don't see them letting go of VR right now because I feel like VR is still successful.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.920
They're still number one in that department.

25:27.920 --> 25:28.920
And I'm looking at chat.

25:28.920 --> 25:29.920
Ah, yes.

25:29.920 --> 25:30.920
Thank you.

25:30.920 --> 25:33.740
Bobby says they've sold more PSVR units than five Oculus Index combined.

25:33.740 --> 25:34.740
That's what I thought.

25:34.740 --> 25:39.240
So that is why I don't see them dropping VR.

25:39.240 --> 25:43.040
Yeah, I think they'll continue with it.

25:43.040 --> 25:47.560
I mean, we see more support for like different games and stuff that are coming out.

25:47.560 --> 25:51.240
I'm just curious to find out more about what the PlayStation 5 is going to bring to it

25:51.240 --> 25:53.760
versus, you know, the backwards compatibility.

25:53.760 --> 25:54.760
Yeah.

25:54.760 --> 25:55.760
All right.

25:55.760 --> 25:58.280
Well, let's move on and get into some other topics for tonight's show.

25:58.280 --> 26:01.960
And we'll talk a little more about what Xbox is doing and Nintendo is doing.

26:01.960 --> 26:05.680
But first, let's talk about what we are doing in our gaming weeks and the types of video

26:05.680 --> 26:09.440
games that we have been playing this week in a segment called How Is Your Gaming Week?

26:09.440 --> 26:11.440
DarkSakura, how is your gaming week?

26:11.440 --> 26:13.440
What have you been up to?

26:13.440 --> 26:16.680
I have been it's been a busy week for me.

26:16.680 --> 26:24.680
We've had some some healthy stuff and I've had doctor's visits and stuff, but they released

26:24.680 --> 26:29.240
new puzzles for patterned on Apple Arcade, which, you know, I love that game.

26:29.240 --> 26:30.600
It's kind of one of my stress reliefs.

26:30.600 --> 26:36.200
I'm going back to playing the moon like mahjong too, just because it's, again, something my

26:36.200 --> 26:37.200
list I can do.

26:37.200 --> 26:39.800
I'm still doing Animal Crossing.

26:39.800 --> 26:42.880
I also have let me look up the word swipe.

26:42.880 --> 26:46.440
I know it's like a dumb little game, but this is what it is.

26:46.440 --> 26:51.560
And I got interested in playing this from playing Words With Friends, which I need to

26:51.560 --> 26:53.060
get back to.

26:53.060 --> 26:55.400
But it's just a fun little game.

26:55.400 --> 27:01.240
And I get annoyed at it because apparently I have a better vocabulary than the game does.

27:01.240 --> 27:03.440
So I like put in a word.

27:03.440 --> 27:05.080
I know that's a word.

27:05.080 --> 27:06.940
The dictionary knows that's a word.

27:06.940 --> 27:08.720
The game doesn't know that's a word.

27:08.720 --> 27:09.720
Stupid game.

27:09.720 --> 27:12.720
I see screenshots all the time of people with words with friends going, what do you mean

27:12.720 --> 27:14.080
that's not a word?

27:14.080 --> 27:15.080
Right.

27:15.080 --> 27:19.240
Well, I do keep when I'm playing Words With Friends, I actually keep the Scrabble dictionary

27:19.240 --> 27:23.480
open to make sure that before I play a word, I'm playing a legit word.

27:23.480 --> 27:24.560
That's a different story.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.680
This one, they are legit words.

27:26.680 --> 27:28.440
I look them up in the dictionary.

27:28.440 --> 27:29.440
Yes.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.160
I spelled queried, right?

27:31.160 --> 27:32.160
Apparently it's.

27:32.160 --> 27:33.160
Yeah.

27:33.160 --> 27:34.160
Anyway.

27:34.160 --> 27:41.960
So, um, however, I got to play one of my favorite words, yurt, do you know what a yurt is?

27:41.960 --> 27:49.080
Um, it's kind of, um, octagonal, uh, structure, how structure usually portable, but some people

27:49.080 --> 27:50.080
have permanent yurts.

27:50.080 --> 27:51.080
Okay.

27:51.080 --> 27:52.080
I thought it was like a math thing.

27:52.080 --> 27:53.080
Oh, no, no.

27:53.080 --> 27:54.080
Okay.

27:54.600 --> 27:55.600
Like house.

27:55.600 --> 27:56.600
Yeah.

27:56.600 --> 27:57.600
Yeah.

27:57.600 --> 27:58.600
I've heard of it.

27:58.600 --> 27:59.600
I used to want to live in a yurt.

27:59.600 --> 28:00.600
So I had a fun time with that one.

28:00.600 --> 28:05.600
Um, um, but at any rate, um, I was playing that I'm going to be sitting back down with

28:05.600 --> 28:06.600
the last of us.

28:06.600 --> 28:12.800
Um, once, uh, I can get some of the pain in my wrist, uh, settled down, um, Dan was playing

28:12.800 --> 28:13.800
doom.

28:13.800 --> 28:19.740
The other day we got doom on a switch and of course playing on the mode that has my

28:19.740 --> 28:22.000
favorite name hurt me plenty.

28:22.000 --> 28:29.840
Um, and it's not a yacht, it's a yurt, SSJ 100, Matt, Y U R T.

28:29.840 --> 28:30.840
Look it up.

28:30.840 --> 28:34.280
Um, also it's a reference to an old, uh, werewolf game.

28:34.280 --> 28:36.280
I used to play tabletop.

28:36.280 --> 28:37.280
Nice.

28:37.280 --> 28:41.880
Um, uh, also, um, speaking of other gaming, um, we switched around some games in the house

28:41.880 --> 28:44.600
to now, uh, Indiana Jones is in the house.

28:44.600 --> 28:46.240
I'll be putting pictures up soon.

28:46.240 --> 28:48.220
Twilight zone is in the house.

28:48.220 --> 28:51.540
I don't know why they moved the white bodies in, but they did.

28:51.540 --> 28:56.500
Um, and, um, I'm, uh, I don't know.

28:56.500 --> 29:00.980
I want to play ghost of Tsushima, but I've got so much else going on right now that it's

29:00.980 --> 29:04.060
kind of fallen on the wayside one game at a time.

29:04.060 --> 29:05.060
Yeah.

29:05.060 --> 29:11.620
Well, and on top of that, um, I'm actually getting wheels in motion for, um, uh, a podcast

29:11.620 --> 29:14.300
myself and video stuff with Dan.

29:14.300 --> 29:17.020
So we've got wheels spinning in the background.

29:17.020 --> 29:18.020
More to come.

29:18.020 --> 29:19.020
Yes.

29:19.020 --> 29:20.020
All right.

29:20.020 --> 29:21.020
On that note, we'll move over to Loki.

29:21.020 --> 29:22.020
Loki.

29:22.020 --> 29:23.020
How was your gaming week?

29:23.020 --> 29:28.700
Um, so my week I played a little bit more Minecraft, of course, um, did that.

29:28.700 --> 29:34.620
I did try to do some game development this week, but it was a big fight between, um,

29:34.620 --> 29:36.860
uh, unity and myself.

29:36.860 --> 29:40.800
So that was the majority of it for like three days.

29:40.800 --> 29:43.480
And then, um, also played some Orna.

29:43.480 --> 29:45.220
I did play a few other things.

29:45.220 --> 29:47.840
So, uh, fall guys, I tried a little bit of that.

29:47.840 --> 29:51.820
So I actually did get in on one of the first few days back when the servers weren't complete

29:51.820 --> 29:54.760
garbage and played a few rounds of them.

29:54.760 --> 29:55.760
It's all right.

29:55.760 --> 30:02.280
I, I think the controls are kind of a little, it's a little frustrating at times.

30:02.280 --> 30:08.600
Um, but I think that's designed that way on purpose, but it's all right.

30:08.600 --> 30:11.400
It's a, it's a, it's a kind of a fun game to play.

30:11.400 --> 30:13.240
Plus it was free PlayStation plus.

30:13.240 --> 30:17.160
Um, I did pick it up on PC as well so I can play with my son who had no interest in playing

30:17.160 --> 30:18.160
with me.

30:18.160 --> 30:19.680
So, oh, there's that.

30:19.680 --> 30:22.040
And then, uh, uh, what else?

30:22.040 --> 30:23.620
Um, oh yeah.

30:23.620 --> 30:24.620
So yeah.

30:24.620 --> 30:29.200
Then I also got, uh, just like Bobby, the, uh, Lego Nintendo set and I was putting that

30:29.200 --> 30:32.520
together on the, um, on Twitch.

30:32.520 --> 30:34.760
I saw your Twitch streams pop up on the fog discord.

30:34.760 --> 30:35.760
That was cool.

30:35.760 --> 30:36.760
Yeah.

30:36.760 --> 30:37.760
So, so we did that.

30:37.760 --> 30:41.000
So I actually do have, um, you know, it right in front of me here.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.760
So it's, it's pretty decent size.

30:43.760 --> 30:48.560
As you can see, um, it's got its controller.

30:48.560 --> 30:52.800
And then of course, uh, the game itself, uh, super Mario brothers.

30:52.800 --> 30:54.320
So you have to lift it up higher.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.320
We can't see.

30:55.320 --> 30:56.320
I know.

30:56.320 --> 30:57.320
I'm sorry.

30:57.320 --> 30:58.600
So you have a super Mario brothers right here.

30:58.600 --> 31:03.480
And then of course the game console, your green screen effect is tearing it apart, but

31:03.480 --> 31:05.440
that's, we're an audio podcast anyway.

31:05.440 --> 31:07.440
So yeah.

31:07.440 --> 31:08.440
So that's pretty cool.

31:08.440 --> 31:11.560
I liked, I liked how they have the little cartridge mechanism in it as well, which is

31:11.560 --> 31:12.560
pretty cool.

31:12.560 --> 31:15.160
So you can put it inside there and actually snaps down and everything.

31:15.160 --> 31:20.680
Um, I'm hopefully going to be doing the, uh, TV a little bit later this week.

31:20.680 --> 31:26.040
I also did pick up the Lego super Mario brother sets, uh, that I couldn't do on stream because

31:26.040 --> 31:30.040
as soon as I brought it in the house, my son wanted me to immediately build it.

31:30.040 --> 31:35.440
So we built that one and one of the expansion sets, I still have, uh, actually it was two

31:35.440 --> 31:39.040
of the expansion sets that we built and I still have one more to build as well.

31:39.040 --> 31:41.080
And so he is, he's been playing with those.

31:41.080 --> 31:47.480
Um, but yeah, it was a pretty cool little toy, so, um, and I really enjoyed the set.

31:47.480 --> 31:51.320
Bobby extensively went into the Lego stuff on his show tonight and he said that that

31:51.320 --> 31:56.080
TV took like six hours to build and, you know, looking at it, it does look like it's a very

31:56.080 --> 31:57.320
like meticulous process.

31:57.320 --> 32:00.160
You kind of have to do pixel by pixel, so to speak.

32:00.160 --> 32:03.400
Um, but the whole thing, he was showing off the whole finished set up, set up and everything.

32:03.400 --> 32:04.840
It does look, it looks really nice.

32:04.840 --> 32:08.700
Like, you know, the fact that it doesn't use like rubber bands and the complicated shit

32:08.700 --> 32:14.300
that Lego has done before, um, like that it's all very, it's just neat.

32:14.300 --> 32:15.300
It's all really cool.

32:15.300 --> 32:16.300
How it's all put together.

32:16.300 --> 32:17.300
Yeah.

32:17.300 --> 32:18.300
I could probably speed run that.

32:18.300 --> 32:22.620
So he says the NES took him six hours, took me four to put it together.

32:22.620 --> 32:26.700
Um, and then, uh, the TV, I don't know, we'll see.

32:26.700 --> 32:32.020
I just, I try to organize myself and just, just knock it out.

32:32.020 --> 32:33.020
So we'll see.

32:33.020 --> 32:35.100
I don't know, but you got to enjoy it.

32:35.100 --> 32:37.620
So, you know, definitely want to take your time.

32:37.620 --> 32:38.620
All right.

32:38.620 --> 32:40.220
You got that for your gaming week?

32:40.220 --> 32:41.220
That is all right.

32:41.220 --> 32:42.220
Then my gaming week.

32:42.220 --> 32:45.580
Um, so a game I didn't play, but I thought about playing cause I have to respond to this

32:45.580 --> 32:50.720
in chat is no man's sky because I was watching Delvin, uh, VG realness in our chat.

32:50.720 --> 32:52.340
Make sure you're following him on Twitch too.

32:52.340 --> 32:56.040
Uh, he was streaming no man's sky and playing it for the first time and kind of watching

32:56.040 --> 32:57.880
him go through it in the beginning.

32:57.880 --> 32:58.880
I did.

32:58.880 --> 33:04.080
I kind of forget that that game really does throw you in and you always start, and this

33:04.080 --> 33:08.380
is, if you didn't know this about no man's sky, you always start on a planet where the

33:08.380 --> 33:10.960
atmosphere is kind of hurting you.

33:10.960 --> 33:13.760
Like you have a limited amount of life that's ticking down.

33:13.760 --> 33:18.660
So you have to be able to move like quick enough to figure out like, Oh, I get my sodium

33:18.660 --> 33:21.000
here to refill this and so on and so on.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.260
So it's, it's, it's not the most kind thing.

33:23.260 --> 33:27.100
Now there are other planets you will find, and if you haven't figured this out yet, Delvin,

33:27.100 --> 33:31.340
where the atmosphere is a lot more forgiving and you can walk around for a lot longer without

33:31.340 --> 33:32.340
needing that stuff.

33:32.340 --> 33:36.300
Um, but I always forgot like, damn, that game really does like throw you in and it can be

33:36.300 --> 33:37.300
kind of stressful.

33:37.300 --> 33:40.640
But I still think that game is so good and so rewarding and I really need to check out

33:40.640 --> 33:42.060
some of the changes.

33:42.060 --> 33:46.220
And I thought it was really good, uh, cause quest buster was posting some stuff to our

33:46.220 --> 33:50.300
discord, uh, which haven't, if you haven't joined our discord yet, check it out, vog

33:50.300 --> 33:56.060
network.com that's vognetwork.com slash discord, uh, and folks chat throughout the week about,

33:56.060 --> 33:58.060
you know, things they heard on the show and stuff.

33:58.060 --> 34:02.460
And one of the things that quest buster was posting about was, Hey, I went and found when

34:02.460 --> 34:07.460
you and Bobby Blackwell for both streaming this game, you built, uh, like houses on voglandia

34:07.460 --> 34:10.060
and I found them here they are and here's what they look like right now.

34:10.060 --> 34:11.060
And I thought that was really cool.

34:11.060 --> 34:16.100
Uh, so it was neat that, uh, quest buster has been, um, going to that too.

34:16.100 --> 34:20.660
And yeah, vg realness points out no man's sky is on game pass for PC and Xbox.

34:20.660 --> 34:25.500
Um, so if you are a game pass person, it's, it's high time to check that out.

34:25.500 --> 34:26.500
It's pretty cool.

34:26.500 --> 34:27.780
So yeah, shout out to no man's sky.

34:27.780 --> 34:32.420
I, I probably will visit it this week, especially because final fantasy 14 is going to be down

34:32.420 --> 34:34.780
all day tomorrow for the big patch maintenance.

34:34.780 --> 34:38.900
And then after that, I will probably be playing nothing but final fantasy 14.

34:38.900 --> 34:41.540
So I need to probably do no man's sky tomorrow.

34:41.540 --> 34:42.540
We'll see.

34:42.540 --> 34:43.780
So that's pretty cool.

34:43.780 --> 34:47.220
Um, we'll see other things that I've actually played this week.

34:47.220 --> 34:48.860
So I played a game called undermine.

34:48.860 --> 34:53.580
Speaking of game pass, uh, that game just recently came to game pass on, I know on Xbox

34:53.580 --> 34:56.580
one, pretty sure it's on PC as well.

34:56.580 --> 34:57.580
Undermine is a rogue.

34:57.580 --> 35:03.740
Like it kind of reminds me of rogue legacy, um, but mixed with like the Zelda look like

35:03.740 --> 35:07.540
the, uh, the two five D Zelda look, cause it's more like one of those like top down

35:07.540 --> 35:09.760
and you're kind of in the dungeon going around the room.

35:09.760 --> 35:12.600
So, um, that's a pretty good combination of games, right?

35:12.600 --> 35:16.040
If you like rogue likes and you like Zelda, I think that'll be up your alley, which is

35:16.040 --> 35:20.380
funny because I also think you have binding at Isaac, but binding of Isaac was a little

35:20.380 --> 35:23.500
more, if I remember right, like a shooter kind of like there was a lot more like shooty

35:23.500 --> 35:24.980
type of mechanics and different things.

35:24.980 --> 35:28.760
I feel like undermine plays a little more like a traditional, traditional Zelda game,

35:28.760 --> 35:33.660
but you're wielding like a pickax instead of a sword, but still it, it, it makes sense.

35:33.660 --> 35:37.420
Um, so I I've been enjoying it, especially because it's a game pass title.

35:37.420 --> 35:40.580
So technically it's like free for me as a subscriber.

35:40.580 --> 35:42.500
So I thought that was kind of neat.

35:42.500 --> 35:45.320
Uh, one of the other games, uh, I've been playing this week.

35:45.320 --> 35:50.320
I checked out fall guys, uh, because that came out on PlayStation and this game of course

35:50.320 --> 35:52.900
is doing very well on Twitch.

35:52.900 --> 35:54.740
Lots of people are streaming this game.

35:54.740 --> 35:58.820
This game seems to be getting more and more, um, kind of like references and pop culture

35:58.820 --> 35:59.820
and so forth.

35:59.820 --> 36:03.860
Um, I think this game is going to stand to do very well.

36:03.860 --> 36:10.620
Um, I think this game is going to follow a very similar trajectory to rocket league.

36:10.620 --> 36:16.540
I think it was very smart of the developers to put it out on PlayStation plus for free

36:16.540 --> 36:20.460
and I'm using my Cody fingers cause obviously PlayStation plus isn't free, but you know

36:20.460 --> 36:21.460
what I mean?

36:21.460 --> 36:25.940
They have all these people already playing it and then now these matches are seated,

36:25.940 --> 36:31.540
these 60 person matches and it's great because it's a battle royale kind of game, right?

36:31.540 --> 36:33.980
But it's not a shooty shooty bang bang game.

36:33.980 --> 36:37.620
So like I'm not great at Fortnite because I'm not really good at shooty shooty bang

36:37.620 --> 36:45.100
bang since the Duke Nukem and Quake days, but this is more of a, uh, hell style platformer.

36:45.100 --> 36:47.420
Uh, and I think it's a lot of fun.

36:47.420 --> 36:52.860
I do agree with what you were saying, Loki, that the controllers feel very rubbery.

36:52.860 --> 36:56.060
I think that's obviously it's the aesthetic of the game.

36:56.060 --> 37:00.420
It's supposed to be rubbery and frustrating character tripping over like every once in

37:00.420 --> 37:01.420
a while.

37:01.420 --> 37:03.420
Like when I was just jumping and it's like, okay, come on.

37:03.420 --> 37:04.420
Like I get it.

37:04.420 --> 37:08.460
Like if I hit something then trip, but like just jumping, I'm going to fall over.

37:08.460 --> 37:09.900
I guess the game's fall guys.

37:09.900 --> 37:13.220
So I mean it makes sense, but it's kind of frustrating.

37:13.220 --> 37:16.300
Bobby's also pointing out in chat over Twitch TV slash vog network.

37:16.300 --> 37:19.980
They also did the Twitch marketing thing where they spent all their marketing energy

37:19.980 --> 37:22.300
on Twitch streamers, big and small.

37:22.300 --> 37:24.060
They didn't do the traditional marketing route.

37:24.060 --> 37:27.300
So some people were like, man, everyone's talking about fall guys that released today

37:27.300 --> 37:29.020
out of nowhere and I don't get it.

37:29.020 --> 37:31.980
And I'm like, that's the only thing that anyone's been playing on Twitch for a week.

37:31.980 --> 37:32.980
Yeah.

37:32.980 --> 37:36.180
And it's a great combination because, Oh, it's free on PlayStation plus.

37:36.180 --> 37:38.460
Well, I'm gonna go get that right now.

37:38.460 --> 37:40.780
And I think it's going to get a huge install base.

37:40.780 --> 37:45.420
And I think the next destination for this game has to be the Nintendo switch.

37:45.420 --> 37:48.620
I think we have a story coming up later about, you know, are they going to be looking at

37:48.620 --> 37:49.820
other platforms?

37:49.820 --> 37:51.620
I don't see how they're not.

37:51.620 --> 37:55.500
And I do think if this game connects with the Nintendo switch with their, which there's

37:55.500 --> 37:59.420
no reason why it shouldn't, I think it's really going to take off at that point.

37:59.420 --> 38:00.420
Yeah.

38:00.420 --> 38:04.940
Um, so Xbox is a little more like, obviously it's just an X, you know, the Xbox and PlayStation

38:04.940 --> 38:07.300
have more in common than they do different.

38:07.300 --> 38:09.540
So I don't think the Xbox is as necessary.

38:09.540 --> 38:13.060
I think it will show up there just like rocket league did.

38:13.060 --> 38:17.420
But I think the switch is that key component where now you're going to have a lot of these

38:17.420 --> 38:21.740
households that only have a switch or there's that portability of the switch.

38:21.740 --> 38:23.580
And I think it's going to do very, very well.

38:23.580 --> 38:27.060
I hope they consider releasing it really low cost on the switch.

38:27.060 --> 38:28.780
Um, I know they can't do it free.

38:28.780 --> 38:30.780
I know it's $20 on steam.

38:30.780 --> 38:34.980
I think if they can get it even lower, release it for like $10 the first week it's out or

38:34.980 --> 38:36.740
something, it'll do very, very well on switch.

38:36.740 --> 38:39.100
And I think this game is going to stand to do very well.

38:39.100 --> 38:44.980
So again, it's, and if you haven't played the game, it's, it's like you go through these

38:44.980 --> 38:52.320
levels that remind you of like either American Ninja Warrior or Wipeout or Takeshi's Castle,

38:52.320 --> 38:53.320
you know, take your pick.

38:53.320 --> 38:59.140
It's one of these types of shows, but 60 people are running it at once and only the top 43

38:59.140 --> 39:01.780
or something like that get to move on to the next round.

39:01.780 --> 39:04.180
It's very much Takeshi's Castle.

39:04.180 --> 39:05.740
That's exactly the format they use.

39:05.740 --> 39:06.740
Yeah.

39:06.740 --> 39:07.740
Yeah.

39:07.780 --> 39:09.220
The top 30 and then the top.

39:09.220 --> 39:13.580
So it's like less and less people get to move on until there's only one winner.

39:13.580 --> 39:18.780
And I think part of the reason they can get, get away with giving this game away for free,

39:18.780 --> 39:22.380
they don't even need to be charging for it, is that of course there's a shop where you

39:22.380 --> 39:24.780
can buy cosmetics or you can buy the coins.

39:24.780 --> 39:29.000
You can either earn the coin slowly through playing the game or if you have to have that

39:29.000 --> 39:33.380
costume right now, cause it's a special, you can pay real money to have that stuff.

39:33.380 --> 39:37.720
It's and again, I think Rocket League is following a very similar trajectory with what it's doing

39:37.720 --> 39:39.120
with its cosmetic store.

39:39.120 --> 39:43.360
So I know I, I know I keep comparing it to Rocket League when really those two games

39:43.360 --> 39:45.520
don't have a lot in common.

39:45.520 --> 39:51.400
Well, it does have something very, it does have something very important in common with

39:51.400 --> 39:53.680
Rocket League actually.

39:53.680 --> 39:58.440
It's very easy to understand how to play, very easy to understand the rules.

39:58.440 --> 40:00.320
You don't really have to explain it to somebody.

40:00.320 --> 40:03.920
It is like you can watch somebody else play the game, hence why it's doing so well on

40:03.920 --> 40:07.520
Twitch and you understand what's going on right away.

40:07.520 --> 40:09.980
And I think that is something it has in common with Rocket League.

40:09.980 --> 40:12.560
Cause Rocket League is like, oh, it's soccer with cars.

40:12.560 --> 40:13.560
Got it.

40:13.560 --> 40:14.800
You know, oh, Fall Guys.

40:14.800 --> 40:20.460
It's a, it's a wacky, zany level that's going to knock you and send you flying that looks

40:20.460 --> 40:26.240
like one of those stupid games Ellen would play on her show, you know, or something like

40:26.240 --> 40:27.240
that.

40:27.240 --> 40:29.760
And it's that, you know, but survivor style.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.160
So it's, it's, it's interesting.

40:31.160 --> 40:36.860
I mean, I think, again, I think the game is going to do very well and it, it, it's a,

40:36.860 --> 40:41.620
it's sometimes those really simple ideas that do great.

40:41.620 --> 40:44.940
And I applaud them for getting to it first, essentially.

40:44.940 --> 40:48.660
How do we do a battle royale game, but a silly platformer?

40:48.660 --> 40:49.660
There you go.

40:49.660 --> 40:50.660
They did it.

40:50.660 --> 40:56.720
So, um, orange right in chat says it's like Takeshi's castle or MXC most extreme challenge

40:56.720 --> 40:58.100
sold me on the game already.

40:58.100 --> 40:59.100
It really is.

40:59.100 --> 41:03.460
Uh, pixel pocket says, oh, I know I bomb out on level one about 80% of the time.

41:03.460 --> 41:04.460
LOL.

41:04.460 --> 41:05.460
Yeah.

41:05.460 --> 41:07.580
I haven't gotten past the third stage yet.

41:07.580 --> 41:11.020
I have yet to get past the third stage, but I'm not super familiar with all the games

41:11.020 --> 41:12.020
yet.

41:12.020 --> 41:16.100
And there's the one I fucking hate is that seesaw level.

41:16.100 --> 41:20.420
There's a level where you're just running across seesaws, but remember there's 60 people

41:20.420 --> 41:21.420
doing it.

41:21.420 --> 41:25.660
So if there's too many people on one side, it starts to tilt that way and all those people

41:25.660 --> 41:26.740
fall off.

41:26.740 --> 41:31.100
So it's, it's, it's really funny when it's not you doing it.

41:31.100 --> 41:38.300
I got to the last round in one of the games, like I got knocked around like somehow like

41:38.300 --> 41:42.700
I've also had a two where like at the very end of the first stage or whatever, that somebody

41:42.700 --> 41:46.300
is waiting there, they're not crossing the finish line and they're like holding onto

41:46.300 --> 41:49.300
you trying to like prevent you from crossing the finish line.

41:49.300 --> 41:51.520
So I don't know what that's all about.

41:51.520 --> 41:57.140
I guess people are trolling people that way, but, um, yeah, it's, it's interesting.

41:57.140 --> 42:00.860
Uh, quest buster in chat says, and you don't need to totally dedicate hours and hours of

42:00.860 --> 42:01.940
time to it too.

42:01.940 --> 42:05.780
I feel like I can play a few rounds for a few minutes and not feel obligated to grind

42:05.780 --> 42:06.780
forever.

42:06.780 --> 42:07.900
That's very true as well.

42:07.900 --> 42:10.480
Like it really only takes a few minutes to play a match.

42:10.480 --> 42:12.940
Like you're not going to be dedicating a huge amount of time to the game.

42:12.940 --> 42:14.540
And I think that is an asset.

42:14.540 --> 42:15.540
Absolutely.

42:15.540 --> 42:19.100
And I think also should be very appealing for the Nintendo switch.

42:19.100 --> 42:24.580
So long story short, this game needs to make its way to Nintendo switch ASAP.

42:24.580 --> 42:25.580
That's for sure.

42:25.580 --> 42:30.620
Um, otherwise also been playing a bit of Ingress and Pokemon go and all the location based

42:30.620 --> 42:31.620
GPS games.

42:31.620 --> 42:32.620
As I usually do.

42:32.620 --> 42:35.060
I was out walking yesterday for a very long time.

42:35.060 --> 42:39.520
I walked eight miles yesterday and that was all doing Ingress missions while I was playing

42:39.520 --> 42:41.020
Pokemon go with Bluetooth.

42:41.020 --> 42:46.820
Um, but I caught like nine shiny Magikarp, which, you know, whatever I was more excited

42:46.820 --> 42:50.100
because unknown are in raids right now, which is very rare.

42:50.100 --> 42:51.700
They don't usually have the unknown in raids.

42:51.700 --> 42:56.940
Um, but they had two letters, U and T and I didn't have yet.

42:56.940 --> 42:57.940
I had L RNA.

42:57.940 --> 42:58.940
It's the spells ultra.

42:59.300 --> 43:05.220
So I had L from trading from Shane who had Celebi and uh, I got dragon con a couple

43:05.220 --> 43:06.220
of years ago.

43:06.220 --> 43:09.740
So the only two letters that were new to me were U and T and I got them both, uh, on my

43:09.740 --> 43:10.740
walking adventure.

43:10.740 --> 43:16.300
And those are the only two missing the C. Uh, no, it's, it's just ultra.

43:16.300 --> 43:17.300
Wob.

43:17.300 --> 43:18.300
Rob.

43:18.300 --> 43:19.300
Oh, I get it.

43:19.300 --> 43:20.300
I get it.

43:20.300 --> 43:21.300
Okay.

43:21.300 --> 43:22.940
Anyway, but yes, uh, I got the letters I needed.

43:22.940 --> 43:23.940
So that's, that's good.

43:23.940 --> 43:28.540
I don't know how many unique unknown letters that gives me now, but it's at least 10, probably

43:28.540 --> 43:29.540
more.

43:29.540 --> 43:30.540
I need to count them all.

43:30.540 --> 43:32.540
So yeah, that's, uh, that's been my game a week.

43:32.540 --> 43:33.540
All right.

43:33.540 --> 43:38.260
We're going to get into some other news tonight and starting off with another, uh, a follow

43:38.260 --> 43:39.820
up to the PlayStation stuff.

43:39.820 --> 43:40.820
Right?

43:40.820 --> 43:41.820
Logie.

43:41.820 --> 43:42.820
Yes.

43:42.820 --> 43:48.060
So one of the cooler looking games that they showed off during the PlayStation, um, state

43:48.060 --> 43:52.140
of play is this game called and must die.

43:52.140 --> 43:55.060
And unfortunately there are some drama behind it though.

43:55.060 --> 44:01.980
So after the whole state of play event in the show, this trailer off, there was a post

44:01.980 --> 44:06.500
on Twitter talking about how this game was stolen.

44:06.500 --> 44:13.620
Um, so basically what happened was the, um, studio limestone games who was behind this

44:13.620 --> 44:18.900
eight members of that creative team, they had resigned from limestone games in June,

44:18.900 --> 44:25.060
um, based on, uh, I guess on hot or hostile working conditions.

44:25.060 --> 44:31.260
They had posts a whole, um, set of testimonies in Dropbox kind of documenting the different

44:31.260 --> 44:33.460
things that they ran on or ran into.

44:33.460 --> 44:38.940
Um, but apparently it's, you know, poor working conditions in the studio behavior of its chief

44:38.940 --> 44:40.940
executive.

44:40.940 --> 44:47.260
And um, they basically said this trailer was created with abuse, manipulation and theft

44:47.660 --> 44:53.020
and people who have worked on every shot of this are no longer in the company, um, holding

44:53.020 --> 44:54.820
IP rights.

44:54.820 --> 44:56.620
Some were not even paid for their work.

44:56.620 --> 45:02.420
The real IP for the game was stolen from the creators BFL play.

45:02.420 --> 45:07.900
And then, um, some of the stuff that they talked about in there as well, that, you know,

45:07.900 --> 45:15.180
there was very little support, um, from the CEO and they were hiring additional developers,

45:15.180 --> 45:17.820
um, to work on the project.

45:17.820 --> 45:25.140
And of course it led to severe workload issues and long crunch and all that type of stuff.

45:25.140 --> 45:30.300
So it is unfortunate that there's all this kind of stuff, marring this down.

45:30.300 --> 45:34.700
And then of course, focus home interactive, which is the publisher of this doesn't really

45:34.700 --> 45:38.660
seem to be involved or they're saying that they're not involved with this, but they're

45:38.660 --> 45:41.780
looking into allegations regarding this.

45:41.780 --> 45:44.020
Um, so it's interesting.

45:44.020 --> 45:48.580
It's kind of sucks to see this marred by this and considering that a lot of development

45:48.580 --> 45:52.500
talent that was behind the game is no longer at the company.

45:52.500 --> 45:55.460
I mean, like, what's that say about the game actually coming out?

45:55.460 --> 46:00.820
Is it, is it really gonna be out anytime soon if all of the talent is gone?

46:00.820 --> 46:02.460
Or how well is it going to be supported?

46:02.460 --> 46:05.300
It sounds like there's, there's little chance of DLC.

46:05.300 --> 46:07.780
What happens if there's issues that need to be patched out?

46:07.780 --> 46:12.500
I mean, you know, there, there might be enough of a crew left to handle some of those things,

46:12.500 --> 46:17.500
but yeah, it doesn't, it doesn't speak very well of the confidence level that people are

46:17.500 --> 46:18.500
supposed to have in this game.

46:18.500 --> 46:24.460
I mean, it's one thing to support a company that treated its employees so terribly, but

46:24.460 --> 46:30.060
the reality is most people looking at the PlayStation 4 don't listen to gaming podcasts

46:30.060 --> 46:32.640
or follow gaming Twitter or any of that stuff.

46:32.640 --> 46:35.020
They're not going to know that this is going on.

46:35.020 --> 46:38.580
So they're going to say, oh, this game looks like something I might enjoy and just buy

46:38.580 --> 46:39.580
it.

46:39.620 --> 46:45.780
But is that going to, you know, is it going to be a, end up being a bad purchase?

46:45.780 --> 46:46.780
I don't know.

46:46.780 --> 46:50.700
I guess the, the reviews will tell, um, it'll be interesting to see if the reviews take

46:50.700 --> 46:54.140
any of this stuff into account because they really probably shouldn't, but it's going

46:54.140 --> 46:56.420
to be hard not to mention it.

46:56.420 --> 47:00.280
Like, like maybe it doesn't affect the score, but it's like, oh, this whole other thing's

47:00.280 --> 47:01.280
going on.

47:01.280 --> 47:06.420
So it made us very curious to see how this game turned out and that whole thing, um,

47:06.420 --> 47:10.340
Jack Defton in our chat over Twitch TV slash vog network says, yeah, this whole situation

47:10.340 --> 47:14.420
sucks and I think most people following this game have pretty much lost interest, including

47:14.420 --> 47:15.420
me.

47:15.420 --> 47:20.080
Uh, Questbuster says the games forum on Steam, as small as it is, is filled with posts asking

47:20.080 --> 47:23.740
for an official statement or just warning people off from buying it.

47:23.740 --> 47:29.440
Ah, that's already not some good signs early on because you do need those loyal fans to

47:29.440 --> 47:31.460
kind of push your sales day one.

47:31.500 --> 47:36.460
Uh, and if you don't have that, that could be detrimental unless, you know, they've worked

47:36.460 --> 47:39.220
out some deal with Sony for really good placement in the store.

47:39.220 --> 47:40.220
I don't know.

47:40.220 --> 47:46.160
Uh, how do you think this ultimately affects the game's release Loki or dark soccer, anybody?

47:46.160 --> 47:50.740
I mean delayed, I don't know.

47:50.740 --> 48:01.380
Um, it's, it's not like, like companies haven't lost, um, lost, uh, games before, lost the

48:01.380 --> 48:06.460
data for their games, had to rebuild part of it, um, server crashes, et cetera.

48:06.460 --> 48:13.980
It's, it's something that a good developer should have a contingency plan for.

48:13.980 --> 48:17.500
They should make backups, they should have other copies.

48:17.500 --> 48:19.700
I mean, that's just common fucking sense.

48:19.700 --> 48:20.700
Yeah.

48:20.700 --> 48:25.220
And if they don't and it forces them to delay, then shame on them that their own damn fault.

48:25.220 --> 48:26.220
Yep.

48:26.220 --> 48:27.220
All right.

48:27.220 --> 48:30.860
Well, we'll see what develops with this game, uh, as it gets closer to release.

48:30.860 --> 48:34.340
And if the, uh, a company ever puts out an official statement or not, but if they haven't

48:34.340 --> 48:38.140
at this point, I'm not sure they will, they might be hoping people will forget, um, by

48:38.140 --> 48:40.020
the time the game releases.

48:40.020 --> 48:41.020
We'll see.

48:41.020 --> 48:42.020
All right.

48:42.020 --> 48:45.980
Anyhow, let's move on and talk about, um, another kind of employee uprising.

48:45.980 --> 48:49.860
This of a very different sort though, and this with a much bigger company, uh, this

48:49.860 --> 48:54.500
has to do with Activision blizzard, you know, um, Activision blizzard just this past week

48:54.500 --> 48:59.980
was talking about their quarter two for 2020 record results for growth, which doesn't surprise

49:00.020 --> 49:03.780
me that video games across the board are doing very well right now in this whole pandemic

49:03.780 --> 49:04.780
situation.

49:04.780 --> 49:07.300
You have a lot of folks that are staying at home playing video games, and I'm sure there

49:07.300 --> 49:11.660
were a lot of people that re up to their world of Warcraft sub who maybe haven't played in

49:11.660 --> 49:14.420
a while and so on things like that.

49:14.420 --> 49:17.820
However, uh, some other stuff that's going on at blizzard.

49:17.820 --> 49:23.060
It was a recent report by Bloomberg news that showed, uh, that blizzard entertainment specifically,

49:23.060 --> 49:29.020
uh, there was a spreadsheet created, uh, this past week that was in response to an internal

49:29.020 --> 49:34.220
study that was done on pay disparity and people started filling out this spreadsheet

49:34.220 --> 49:35.220
with salary.

49:35.220 --> 49:39.620
It was like anonymous, like how much are you making, how much pay increases have you got?

49:39.620 --> 49:43.260
And people started filling out with their salaries and their pay increases.

49:43.260 --> 49:47.660
And it showed that raises fell well below expectations.

49:47.660 --> 49:53.620
Um, the findings found that producers and engineers at blizzard can get six figure salaries,

49:53.620 --> 49:58.140
but quality assurance, customer service, barely making minimum wage.

49:58.140 --> 50:03.900
Um, some internal dialogue in 2018 showed that, uh, folks were kind of struggling at

50:03.900 --> 50:08.460
their pay level, uh, that they, you know, needed more money to get by because again,

50:08.460 --> 50:14.260
uh, blizzard headquarters is in Irvine, orange County, not that, I mean, it's not San Francisco,

50:14.260 --> 50:15.860
but it's not much cheaper.

50:15.860 --> 50:18.380
It's a Southern California is a very expensive place to live.

50:18.380 --> 50:23.820
So, uh, yeah, uh, apparently a long time employee of blizzard said to Bloomberg, they

50:23.820 --> 50:31.260
are making less than they did 10 years ago because of small raises and lack of overtime

50:31.260 --> 50:32.260
hours.

50:32.260 --> 50:33.780
They're not working as much overtime as they used to.

50:33.780 --> 50:41.020
Uh, but again, that is a very, um, contrast to, wow, we're doing great as a company.

50:41.020 --> 50:42.020
Wow.

50:42.020 --> 50:45.220
But our employees are finding they're really not making a lot of money.

50:45.220 --> 50:50.980
Um, and this went on to, um, and it's not in the story I'm looking at here, but I know

50:50.980 --> 50:56.660
the employees were really kind of starting to band together to make some specific demands

50:56.660 --> 50:57.660
of blizzard.

50:57.660 --> 51:01.380
And I know one of them that I was reading about was they wanted blizzard to come up

51:01.380 --> 51:07.300
with employee retention because blizzard was losing so many people to like riot games,

51:07.300 --> 51:08.700
the developers of league of legends.

51:08.700 --> 51:12.660
I think they're over in studio city or something, but they're also in Southern California and

51:12.660 --> 51:14.220
other competition in the industry.

51:14.220 --> 51:19.440
And of course, you know, when a long time folks leave that can really hurt morale and

51:19.440 --> 51:23.140
trying to have to start over from the, from the beginning and some things and things of

51:23.140 --> 51:24.140
that nature.

51:24.140 --> 51:28.680
So, you know, blizzard, these employees are starting to make some demands and that's also

51:28.680 --> 51:36.780
kind of getting people to see or say, wow, this may be the early form of a union forming

51:36.780 --> 51:37.980
in the gaming industry.

51:37.980 --> 51:44.120
I mean, we do have a case of employees coming together and unionizing.

51:44.120 --> 51:48.380
It's just not under the, uh, an official, you know, thing that they're paying into or

51:48.380 --> 51:51.460
anything like that, but they're coming together to make some demands.

51:51.460 --> 51:55.380
Uh, and that's, um, pretty, pretty interesting.

51:55.380 --> 51:59.340
Um, another kind of, oh yeah, no, I think this is a great thing.

51:59.340 --> 52:00.340
And I think you're gonna see what we're coming to.

52:00.340 --> 52:02.220
I was going to say one thing.

52:02.220 --> 52:03.220
Oh, one thing.

52:03.220 --> 52:04.220
Oh, I thought you said good thing.

52:04.220 --> 52:05.220
Yeah.

52:05.220 --> 52:06.220
What?

52:06.260 --> 52:10.700
This goes back to something that actually should be universal in a lot of jobs where

52:10.700 --> 52:12.500
you have income transparency.

52:12.500 --> 52:17.300
Um, you know, you, you, you work at a place and they say, oh, don't show this to your

52:17.300 --> 52:18.300
coworkers.

52:18.300 --> 52:19.300
Don't tell them what you make.

52:19.300 --> 52:20.300
This is private, blah, blah, blah.

52:20.300 --> 52:23.940
The thing is that they don't want you to tell other people so that people will say, oh,

52:23.940 --> 52:28.540
I'm not making what I'm worth, you know, for people doing the same job.

52:28.540 --> 52:32.940
And I think that we're starting to see a lot more, you know, people in other companies

52:32.940 --> 52:35.180
start to be a lot more transparent with their income.

52:35.220 --> 52:36.220
And I think this is fantastic.

52:36.220 --> 52:42.700
And I really want this to be, uh, considered a, I'd say a more universal example.

52:42.700 --> 52:45.820
I would love to see this encourage other people to do it.

52:45.820 --> 52:48.940
And I definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely think that this should be the start

52:48.940 --> 52:50.300
of a union.

52:50.300 --> 52:53.380
The video game industry must unionize.

52:53.380 --> 52:59.000
Yeah, there's, there's so much I want to say on that due to the nature of like what I do

52:59.000 --> 53:01.300
now for work versus what I did a couple of years ago.

53:01.300 --> 53:04.060
But I really don't want to get into my day job, but there's so much like, I want to like

53:04.100 --> 53:06.820
elaborate about some of the differences and fascinating things.

53:06.820 --> 53:15.220
So, but, well, I will say, as, as, you know, a lot of women have learned, you know, when

53:15.220 --> 53:19.300
we start speaking out about our salaries and hearing what our male counterparts are making,

53:19.300 --> 53:22.500
um, the income disparity becomes very obvious.

53:22.500 --> 53:28.940
What you see from across the range of, of diversity, you'll, you'll find people with

53:28.940 --> 53:31.580
different backgrounds making more or less than others.

53:31.580 --> 53:35.300
You'll see, uh, it across, you know, the racial board as well.

53:35.300 --> 53:43.780
So I really am so proud of all of these people with their transparency.

53:43.780 --> 53:45.820
And I just lost dark soccer for a minute there.

53:45.820 --> 53:47.020
I don't know if that's a discord crash.

53:47.020 --> 53:48.020
Oh, no, you're back.

53:48.020 --> 53:49.020
Yeah, it was a weird pickup.

53:49.020 --> 53:50.020
Sorry.

53:50.020 --> 53:51.580
I was gonna say, hold their asses to the fire.

53:51.580 --> 53:56.580
Be honest, be transparent, but I want to see this turn into a movement in the video game

53:56.580 --> 53:57.580
industry.

53:57.580 --> 53:58.580
Hmm.

53:58.580 --> 53:59.580
Okay.

54:00.580 --> 54:07.140
Now, I'm not sure if the disparity in gender is something that's showing here, just to

54:07.140 --> 54:08.140
be fair.

54:08.140 --> 54:12.340
I don't see it in this article here that that is an issue at blizzard specifically.

54:12.340 --> 54:15.420
No, I know, I know, but I just want to make that clear.

54:15.420 --> 54:19.460
Um, that's a different thing, um, and still bad.

54:19.460 --> 54:25.540
Um, but one thing that is brought up is how about Bobby Kotick as the CEO of Activision

54:25.540 --> 54:28.900
blizzard and what is he making compared to the average worker?

54:28.900 --> 54:33.660
Well, uh, Bobby Kotick made over $33 million in the year 2016.

54:33.660 --> 54:37.300
That is over 300 times of the average employee.

54:37.300 --> 54:42.060
Now there are some pro labor groups because I think there are folks out there trying to

54:42.060 --> 54:47.580
encourage the blizzard folks to unionize and they are happy to represent them and so forth.

54:47.580 --> 54:52.180
And they've done some studies, uh, showing that Kotick makes all this money because there

54:52.180 --> 54:58.420
are multiple overlapping award provisions that were 96.5 million in bonuses over the

54:58.460 --> 54:59.740
last four years.

54:59.740 --> 55:04.820
That is more than the total pay of any other CEO in the gaming industry.

55:04.820 --> 55:09.500
He makes more in bonuses than any other CEO in the gaming industry.

55:09.500 --> 55:20.980
So I think that is, so dark soccer is polishing off her guillotine metaphorically, uh, but

55:20.980 --> 55:27.180
I mean seriously, like he's, he's making a lot of money and it's not really fair, especially

55:27.180 --> 55:30.980
considering what the other people in his industry are making.

55:30.980 --> 55:36.260
And I gotta be honest, blizzard specifically, now I know he's over Activision blizzard,

55:36.260 --> 55:40.460
but blizzard specific, you know, well actually Activision has not had a great last four years

55:40.460 --> 55:41.580
either.

55:41.580 --> 55:43.960
Blizzard hasn't had a great last two years.

55:43.960 --> 55:48.780
That Blizzcon a couple of years ago was a disaster.

55:48.780 --> 55:51.820
And so, uh, you know, that wasn't good for them.

55:51.820 --> 55:55.040
So why is he getting bonuses for how that Blizzcon went over?

55:55.040 --> 55:59.000
Why is he getting bonuses for how destiny two launched?

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Yike.

56:01.000 --> 56:05.800
So that is something the employees and so forth will have to figure out, I suppose.

56:05.800 --> 56:06.800
All right.

56:06.800 --> 56:09.920
We need to, I am just, I'm all for this though.

56:09.920 --> 56:14.760
I just want to see people held accountable.

56:14.760 --> 56:15.760
That's it.

56:15.760 --> 56:16.760
I do too.

56:16.760 --> 56:20.600
I think it's great that people are starting to more openly discuss these things in the

56:20.600 --> 56:22.120
gaming industry.

56:22.120 --> 56:27.560
And you know, I think, I think that the day of reckoning for, uh, you know, basically

56:27.560 --> 56:32.800
abusing the enthusiasm of folks wanting to work in the game industry, cause that's what

56:32.800 --> 56:37.160
a lot of this amounts to because for so many years it's been, well, if you don't like what

56:37.160 --> 56:40.840
you do fucking leave, cause there's 10 kids that'll gladly take your spots.

56:40.840 --> 56:43.880
They can work in video games and you know, that's been the attitude in the gaming industry

56:43.880 --> 56:45.220
for a long time.

56:45.220 --> 56:50.200
And I really feel like the day of reckoning for that is overdue and it's coming.

56:50.200 --> 56:51.200
It's coming.

56:51.280 --> 56:58.360
The industry is another industry, you know, at the end of the day and because it's such

56:58.360 --> 57:04.940
a common aspect now of everyday industry, you know, it's as, it's as common as I'd say

57:04.940 --> 57:08.800
any manufacturing job, massive design jobs.

57:08.800 --> 57:09.960
It's a big corporation.

57:09.960 --> 57:14.840
You know, the, the whole aspect of its economy is, you know, massive corporations, people

57:14.840 --> 57:20.440
that are, you know, it's like the thing now is to be the independent developer, making

57:20.440 --> 57:21.640
it big.

57:21.640 --> 57:25.720
That's really going to be the bit of a rarity just because you can say, Oh, well now I'm

57:25.720 --> 57:30.040
working at, at square, you know, or squinnix or, or whatever.

57:30.040 --> 57:31.400
Yeah, it's cool.

57:31.400 --> 57:34.920
But in the end, you know, it's a job.

57:34.920 --> 57:40.280
If it pays your bills, I mean, it would be great to say, yeah, I'd like to work for,

57:40.280 --> 57:43.400
you know, um, you know, so and so company, that would be awesome.

57:43.400 --> 57:46.960
I love the company that I work for and I find it amazing that I work there.

57:46.960 --> 57:54.440
I can't, you know, say who, but at the end of the day, the job that you have is as good

57:54.440 --> 57:55.440
as number one.

57:55.440 --> 57:58.840
If you enjoy it, number two of the company takes care of you for the work that you give

57:58.840 --> 57:59.840
them.

57:59.840 --> 58:04.520
Um, Bobby, Bobby Black Wolf in our chat says, I actually work with several ex video game

58:04.520 --> 58:05.520
developers.

58:05.520 --> 58:08.280
They like working in financial banking software way more than gaming.

58:08.280 --> 58:14.760
You know, that's how I feel about radio, honestly, like if you want to, you want to make a comparison

58:14.760 --> 58:15.760
there.

58:15.760 --> 58:19.200
Cause I used to get asked all the time, especially in the early days of podcasting, especially

58:19.200 --> 58:23.040
when we were first on iTunes and we were, you know, showing up on the news and it was

58:23.040 --> 58:27.960
really kind of the height of this show's popularity to be quite candid, uh, was when we were one

58:27.960 --> 58:29.680
of the first podcasts on iTunes.

58:29.680 --> 58:34.480
Uh, I got asked quite frequently, why don't you work in a traditional radio?

58:34.480 --> 58:35.920
Why don't you have a great face for radio?

58:35.920 --> 58:38.720
Why don't you go work in traditional radio?

58:38.720 --> 58:45.280
And the answer is, um, I really like doing radio on my own terms because when I was in

58:45.280 --> 58:50.720
college, I studied to do TV and radio on someone else's terms and I didn't like it.

58:50.720 --> 58:56.680
I didn't, I don't have the, I mean, I know I get teased sometimes for ego, uh, by captain

58:56.680 --> 59:00.520
Matt over at Starboard Power Coupling and stuff, but I don't have the ego you need to

59:00.520 --> 59:03.820
thrive in an industry like that.

59:03.820 --> 59:07.880
Look at somebody that does very well like Howard Stern.

59:07.880 --> 59:09.900
You know, I realize he's controversial.

59:09.900 --> 59:14.000
I'm not here to say, you know, good guy, bad guy, whatever, but we can all agree he's got

59:14.000 --> 59:15.060
an ego.

59:15.060 --> 59:19.380
He loves himself and that's how he succeeds very well in the right over the, uh, radio

59:19.380 --> 59:20.380
industry.

59:20.380 --> 59:27.060
So, uh, yeah, as you go, but I'm lazy as she went under, Matt says at the end of the day,

59:27.060 --> 59:30.540
someone working in a major company shouldn't have to live with four to five roommates in

59:30.540 --> 59:33.780
a San Francisco apartment, but I understand that's a different situation.

59:33.780 --> 59:39.080
Well, you also have the issue of like San Francisco housing, but that is, as we say,

59:39.080 --> 59:43.500
to invoke another famous broadcaster, a whole nother Oprah.

59:43.500 --> 59:46.960
So in the meantime, let's go on to the next story.

59:46.960 --> 59:48.900
Let's talk about people who are leaving.

59:48.900 --> 59:54.860
Actually, just to put that into a little bit of perspective, what I pay in my mortgage

59:54.860 --> 01:00:02.700
for my house is half of what a friend pays for an apartment that's, uh, half the size.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:03.700
Yeah.

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:07.220
Just putting that out there for San Francisco versus like where I am in Sacramento.

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:08.220
Yeah.

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:11.620
San Francisco is, uh, it's, I love it.

01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:16.940
I love the city, but I, I could not imagine living there the way it is economically right

01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:17.940
now.

01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:18.940
It's, it's something else.

01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:19.940
Yeah.

01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:20.940
I just, I just visit my friends.

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:21.940
Exactly.

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:22.940
Love to see my friends.

01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:23.940
Yep.

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:24.940
Hearts.

01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:25.940
I miss them all.

01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:31.980
So, um, how about though, as you mentioned other people leaving and this one, um, I've

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:39.460
got mixed feelings about it because this person has been just a big part of Capcom for so

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:47.340
long, almost 30 years, but, um, Yoshinori Ono has, uh, left, uh, is leaving, uh, Capcom

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:48.340
this summer.

01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:52.820
And he also will have to big message about his thoughts about the criticism made to the

01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:53.820
Capcom pro tour.

01:00:53.820 --> 01:01:01.140
Um, since, since, uh, COVID-19, it has moved entirely online, but his statement, uh, he

01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:04.860
first acknowledged that, which was, I'd say pretty classy and, you know, his quote says

01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:08.740
it took a long time for us to decide the format for this year, but we believe that conducting

01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:13.180
the event itself would repay those who have been supporting the CPT, regardless of what

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:14.700
format it is.

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:18.900
And then he goes on to say, and now after serving almost 30 years at Capcom, I'm leaving

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:20.460
the company this summer.

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:25.660
This means I will resign my position as brand manager for Capcom's various titles, including

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:26.980
street fighter.

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:30.460
Um, and he worked on, on a bunch of great stuff.

01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:35.940
He worked on mega man series, dead rising, devil may cry, but he's really one of the

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:40.420
ones who was behind getting street fighter back on this forward motion, starting with

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:45.780
street fighter four, um, which honestly, I think I prefer to street fighter five, but

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:46.780
I digress.

01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:52.420
Um, but anyway, um, he, he says he's really excited to see what's going to happen to see

01:01:52.420 --> 01:02:00.780
what it's like in someone's new hands, but, um, but you know, it is, it is a, a massive

01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:02.140
torch to pass on.

01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:08.540
You're going to need someone who can take that up and then he can keep going with it.

01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:13.640
I mean, but keep in mind, you know, there's also a few things about, oh no, that people

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:15.020
don't seem to remember.

01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:16.660
He got demoted twice.

01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:21.660
Um, you know, it was supposed to say, you know, one of the things that street fighter

01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:26.100
six was supposed to be released next year, but the testing ended up being absolutely

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:29.660
a disaster and they hired another director to start it over from scratch.

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:37.020
He also gave a street fighter cross Tekken, which, you know, pretty much bombed, um, you

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:41.500
know, so keep in mind, it's because we're all still waiting for Tekken cross street

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:48.780
fighter, but at any, but at any rate, yeah, the, the whole thing is that while he's done

01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:54.300
a lot of amazing things, he does have some pretty big fails, um, you know, in his portfolio

01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:55.580
as well.

01:02:55.580 --> 01:03:06.220
So, um, hopefully him taking a step back might be another revitalization for, uh, for Capcom.

01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:10.420
I mean, I'd love them to revisit, you know, older fighting games that they did before.

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:15.140
Like I would love a red earth, um, you know, to come out like a newer red earth game or

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:17.700
just a release of red earth for my home system.

01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:22.300
I am a hundred percent with VG realness and chat, give us Capcom versus SNK three.

01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:26.940
That is like probably my favorite 2d fighter period is, uh, CVS too.

01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:27.940
Yeah.

01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:28.940
I enjoy that.

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:35.100
I mean, I do also though greatly enjoy the Marvel versus, uh, Capcom series a whole lot,

01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:40.140
but, um, you know what I want them to bring back is I want them to do another Tatsunoko

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:45.820
versus Capcom, but like, just weren't there rumors about that, making a comeback like

01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:51.380
a second game, I guess they just kind of fizzled or better than that rival schools, give us

01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:55.140
another, um, you've been on that 18 years.

01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:56.140
You've been on that one.

01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:57.140
I have.

01:03:57.140 --> 01:03:58.140
And you know what?

01:03:58.140 --> 01:03:59.140
I'm fucking right.

01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:06.260
You know, I'm going to reply to that, say, okay, now rival school three, I'm just going

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:07.260
to make a trend.

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:08.500
We're going to make rival schools three trend again.

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:09.500
Y'all let's get to it.

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:16.020
If we made president cat happen, we are going to make rival schools three.

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:18.940
There's that ego we were talking about earlier and I was right.

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:19.940
And I'm right.

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:21.500
I am right.

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:27.060
And I will, I will go down with this burning boat fire.

01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:29.500
You know, I am right.

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:32.700
She's she's, she's laying down the blanket on that Hill.

01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:34.660
Cause she's ready to die on it.

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:36.780
Fuck that.

01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:41.020
I will emulate myself on that Hill.

01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:44.380
Burning rage of rage.

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.800
Nothing says, I love you.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:48.900
Like setting the Hill on file fire with my corpse.

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:49.900
Exactly.

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:50.900
Exactly.

01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:56.660
And, and there will be a special explosion afterwards where my burning remnants will

01:04:56.660 --> 01:05:06.420
spell out Kanji for she needs to justice got Gwen, the end, uh, looking in chat for some

01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:07.420
other comments.

01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:11.860
Um, somehow we, uh, got off the topic of Yoshinori Ono.

01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:13.300
Um, let's see.

01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:16.260
As she, 100 Matt says, I was shocked about Ono leaving.

01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:18.580
He was the face of street fighter and a really neat guy.

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:21.980
I remember him in New York comic con going around the show floor, shaking everyone's

01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:24.620
hands and posing for pictures and having fun.

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.820
The guy was always humble and cool with fans.

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:27.820
Yeah.

01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:31.320
He does seem to have like, and I love seeing that guy on stage.

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:33.140
Like he, he does have a presence.

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:38.900
I mean, I realized that doesn't necessarily mean that's going to translate to street fighter

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:40.500
six is going to be great.

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:44.820
Like there, those are two very different roles and I don't mean to slander or talk negative

01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:45.820
of Ono.

01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:46.820
Cause I don't know.

01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:47.820
I didn't play street fighter six.

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:49.740
I don't know what he's like from eight to five.

01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:54.580
What I do know is that he is great with fans and he is a real joy to see at these events

01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:58.020
with his enthusiasm and everything that he does when he talks about the games and all

01:05:58.020 --> 01:05:59.020
that stuff.

01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:05.020
So I feel like somebody's gonna snatch him up just to be an ambassador for their product.

01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:12.920
If nothing else, or he's going to do something on his own, you know, Oh, I should get my

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:13.920
tinfoil hat.

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.620
I need a tinfoil hat or something that I can put on.

01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:17.620
You ready for this?

01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:22.420
Do you know, do you know who should hire Yoshinori Ono to do hype?

01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:25.420
Konami?

01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:26.420
No.

01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:27.420
They need something.

01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:28.420
No.

01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:29.420
Good call, but no.

01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:30.420
They need a kick up the ass.

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:31.420
American company.

01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:34.420
Microsoft.

01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:35.420
Microsoft.

01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:36.420
Microsoft.

01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:37.420
No.

01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:38.420
Yep.

01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:39.420
No.

01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:40.420
Yep.

01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:43.420
Because I, they need more Japanese talent, that's for sure, because that's an audience

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:47.220
they haven't managed to draw in ever.

01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:48.820
I'm just throwing it out there.

01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:55.820
I think, and I think just no matter what country you're in, his enthusiasm is infectious.

01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:56.820
Just saying.

01:06:57.820 --> 01:06:58.820
Okay.

01:06:58.820 --> 01:06:59.820
All right.

01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:01.820
SS200Matt says, that's plausible.

01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:03.420
Well, anything is.

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:05.820
VGRealness says, who is Konami?

01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:06.820
I don't know her anymore.

01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:10.820
Maybe we'll have some Konami news later in the show, but for now, Loki.

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:12.820
Yeah.

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:14.820
Let's talk about Rock City instead.

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:21.420
So Rock City, of course, most recently known for making some pretty awesome Batman Arkham

01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:22.420
games.

01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:29.420
They have announced an announcement that's going to be at DC Fandom, August 22nd, for

01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:32.420
a Suicide Squad game that they're doing.

01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:40.420
And right now, they've also registered the domain SuicideSquadKilledTheJusticeLeague.com.

01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:42.420
That's a mouthful.

01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:43.420
Yes.

01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:50.020
So basically, apparently, it looks like the premise based on the crosshairs on the back

01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:55.020
of Superman's head is some sort of premise that the Suicide Squad, I guess, is going

01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:57.020
to be going after the Justice League.

01:07:57.020 --> 01:07:58.020
It sounds interesting.

01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:04.020
It's almost like a Suicide Squad version of The Boys, I guess.

01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:07.020
But yeah, I'm down.

01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:09.020
I guess we'll have to wait and hear the details on that.

01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:12.020
But I know the Batman Arkham games are pretty awesome.

01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:17.620
And I, despite the movie not being that great, did like Suicide Squad.

01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:20.620
So I'm interested.

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:21.620
Yeah.

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:22.620
I'm curious to see what they do.

01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:23.620
I'm kind of with you.

01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:29.620
I'm like, you know, Suicide Squad is kind of like, eh, but as a movie or whatever.

01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:34.820
But knowing that Rocksteady did such amazing work with Batman, I feel like they will make

01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:38.620
Suicide Squad into something that would be really good for a game.

01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:39.620
I'm trying to believe.

01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:40.620
I want to believe.

01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:41.620
Yeah.

01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:45.220
Well, they have the new movie coming, and that looks pretty good.

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:46.220
That's true.

01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:51.220
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, the Suicide Squad game has been rumored for at least five years.

01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:53.220
That's probably how long it's been taking them to make it.

01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:54.220
I mean, these...

01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:58.220
Well, now all we need is a Harry Potter game announcement that's been rumored just as long.

01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:00.220
It won't get my money.

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:02.220
Didn't something leak with that?

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:10.220
And it's because the whole J.K., J. Karen Rowling and her constant foot in her fucking mouth

01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:12.820
and all the shitty things she said on Twitter.

01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:15.820
I feel like some of that started to leak out with that game that they're making.

01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:19.820
And some people are just trying to tell EA or whoever was making it, back away.

01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:21.820
Make a generic wizard game.

01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:28.820
Don't put Harry Potter on it because she's tying herself.

01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:32.820
She is setting herself on fire and dying on a really stupid hill.

01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:33.820
Yeah.

01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:34.820
Anyway.

01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:39.820
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, they were rumored to be in development with it since 2013 when

01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:41.420
it was teased in Arkham Origins.

01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:42.420
Yeah.

01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:45.420
I mean, honestly, games take a long time to make.

01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:47.420
And it's probably in a newer engine or something.

01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:50.420
It's something where maybe the first game will take a long time, but we'll probably

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:54.420
get like three Suicide Squad games over six years.

01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:59.420
Or they could just do the same action for more Batman games or who knows?

01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:00.420
Who knows?

01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:01.420
Anything's possible.

01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:02.420
All right.

01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:03.420
Moving on.

01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:06.420
Something that won't be coming out as soon as we thought, although I'm not entirely surprised

01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:07.420
by this.

01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:13.020
But there was a video that was released this week by Intellivision.

01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:17.820
Tommy was hyping it up and Intellivision was tweeting it out as it was a live broadcast,

01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:18.820
but it really wasn't.

01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:21.820
It was a premiere of an edited broadcast.

01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:22.820
Okay.

01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:23.820
Whatever.

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:24.820
Fine.

01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:25.820
It was a direct of sorts.

01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:26.820
We'll leave it at that.

01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:28.620
It was like an Intellivision direct.

01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:32.740
And it was fine, but it did kick off with the news that the Intellivision amico was

01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:35.960
going to be delayed until April 2021.

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:42.880
After the original October 2020 launch date and a very personal moment from Tommy Tallarico

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:48.120
in the beginning there, where he talked about how the 10 10 20 date was really tied to something

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:51.760
that he had promised for his sister and was openly kind of talking about that she passed

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:59.880
away and was getting very emotional, which is not something you often see in CEO deliveries.

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:03.800
But it was certainly impactful that you could tell that he didn't want to do this, but he

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:05.280
knows it's for the best.

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:08.240
And honestly, in disclosure, I've already backed.

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:13.240
Well, it's not really backing, but I preordered amico or whatever you want to call it.

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:17.000
And I'm not mad about this.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.840
It's one of these things where it's like, well, it's just another thing that COVID ruined.

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.060
But I don't blame Tommy.

01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:24.160
I don't blame Intellivision.

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:26.240
I don't blame anything but COVID.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:29.240
I blame our government's mismanagement of COVID.

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:32.840
But again, that is a whole nother episode of a different show.

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:38.000
So it is what it is and it's getting delayed till April as a result.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.640
I do think it's cute that they're trying to get the backer systems out now.

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:42.640
What is it?

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:43.640
April 3rd, 2021.

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.700
So it's four, three, two, one.

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:48.320
Like Tommy does have an obsession with numbers.

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:53.520
I think like he has to have I wonder if he's like marketing sense, Rob.

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:54.520
It's just market.

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:55.520
It is.

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:56.520
It is.

01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:00.640
But I'm kind of like, well, will he not release games when Friday is on a 13th and I don't

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:01.640
I'm just teasing.

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:06.040
I'm just having a hard time still being interested in the system.

01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:13.760
Like I like I watched the whole presentation that they had and not not to say that everything

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:14.960
looks terrible.

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:16.520
I think things look fine.

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:19.800
There are some games that seem interesting, but there's a lot of games that seem very

01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:20.800
generic.

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:24.560
Like it looks like a generic flash game being thrown on the system.

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:29.400
And honestly, like that's not what I would want to like throw out there is like bring

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:31.400
people in and make them excited about it.

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:35.000
There was a there was a shmup game that they had on there looked pretty cool.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.480
There was some of the more retro reimagined versions of like I want to say it was Breakout

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:44.760
or something that looked pretty cool.

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:45.760
I think there's some.

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:46.760
OK.

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:47.760
So they just very generic.

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:50.680
You know, you know, this criticism is coming, though, and I think something you have to

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:54.640
remember and keep in the back of your mind is that this system is not for you.

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:58.840
I understand that, but it doesn't just because it's an underpowered system doesn't mean that

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:01.860
you can't make things look nice or put polish on them.

01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:03.180
And I guess it's still early.

01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:05.280
The games aren't out yet, but it is early.

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:09.840
And I think, you know, I think some of the games honestly to me are looking good enough,

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:13.040
especially for, you know, the fact that none of the games are going to cost over eight

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.040
dollars.

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.240
I think the Breakout game looks very good.

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:17.920
I think the racing game will be cool.

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:21.640
Like I could give or take the cornhole or some of those other things.

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:27.240
But I also but I kind of also remember in the back of my mind, you know, he really wants

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:33.360
to pitch this to an audience and a household that doesn't usually adopt video games.

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:39.520
This is pitching for, hey, how about for family game night on Tuesday, you try this new game

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:41.340
from Intellivision Amico.

01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:46.100
And I think it is a little bit of a gamble, but I'm not so sat on the that he's going

01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:47.100
to fail.

01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:50.480
Well, I wouldn't be if I would have preordered one if I thought, oh, he's going to fail because

01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:52.020
I don't think he will.

01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:58.500
But I think a big part of the success of this thing is going to hinge on getting the right

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:00.640
messaging out.

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:05.100
And I think for that reason, the three of us and those you out there listening to this

01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:08.260
and watching this probably won't be seeing a lot of it.

01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:13.580
And that's OK, because, again, it's not really for the audience that's looking for gaming

01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:16.340
podcasts and gaming news and stuff.

01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:19.400
But if he isn't, you know, some of this came up on Bobby's show.

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:23.760
If he's teaming up with, you know, Ellen or well, I guess, you know, Ellen isn't much

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:24.980
longer for TV.

01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:29.900
He's teaming up with Kelly Clark, Kelly Clarkson, let's say, or Oprah, you know, the daytime

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:31.840
TV stuff.

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:34.300
That's the way to do it and to get into some of those.

01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:37.540
And, you know, I think this is the type of thing that should like have a booth at the

01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:39.740
State Fair.

01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:45.520
And if they're teaming up with MLB, then when they wish they are, then when baseball comes

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:49.960
back someday, this thing should be on display at baseball games.

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:53.620
If they're teaming up with Sesame Street, this thing should be on display at Sesame

01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:54.960
Street on ice.

01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:58.500
When these things come back, obviously, in the pandemic world, we can't think of those

01:14:58.500 --> 01:14:59.500
things right now.

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:02.040
But you guys know what I mean long term.

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:04.560
This thing should show up at those types of family friendly events.

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:07.340
And I think if that happens, it'll do fine.

01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:12.040
And for me, as a mid-core gamer or whatever you want to call me, the reason why I'm still

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:17.020
kind of interested in Amico, even if, yeah, not all the games look like I'm going to be

01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:22.320
thrilled by it, but I am really interested in the retro reimagined stuff, you know?

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:28.280
And I'm trying to put on my hat for what made Atari 2600 games good or what made the original

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:30.080
Intellivision games good.

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:34.440
Sometimes it was just a very simple concept that was fun to, you know, like look at a

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:35.440
game like Astro Smash.

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:36.440
Market dominance.

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:37.440
Yeah, well.

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:39.920
Market dominance for Atari, sorry.

01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:43.560
Yes, but even if I were to go back to old Intellivision games, there's a lot of those

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:47.160
I could play over and over and over again, like Astro Smash is a really fun one, right?

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:48.320
And they're reimagining it.

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:53.200
Missile Command is a lot of fun, which is, I know it's weird because the Atari properties

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:57.440
are bleeding over into Intellivision with this retro reimag, because, you know, Breakout's

01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:01.600
coming, Missile Command's coming, and they're Atari properties, but whatever.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:08.040
I still think those games, they're very classic simplicity, easy to explain and get into,

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:11.480
I think will lend itself well to that system.

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:16.200
We just talked about why is Fall Guys doing so well?

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:18.320
Because you don't have to explain it.

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:21.480
You can figure it out really easy by watching somebody else do it.

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:26.380
And every Amico game, for better or for worse, is going to be like that.

01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:30.480
And I think there are going to be some winners and some losers, but you know what?

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:33.560
Every console has some winners and some losers.

01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:40.640
Now to be fair and to be critical where I should be when it comes to Intellivision Amico,

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:46.100
I think their biggest challenge is going to be Nintendo Switch.

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:51.760
And that $250 price tag is going to put them $50 under a Nintendo Switch, which is the

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:57.400
other system, and that's the Disney of consoles and what you think of when you think of family

01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.880
friendly games today.

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:06.360
Now obviously the big difference is that Mario and Zelda and Animal Crossing and those games

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:09.400
are still going to cost you $50, $60.

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:12.760
Amico's not going to have anything over $8.

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:18.660
The make or break is going to be how well that messaging gets out there that the games

01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:21.080
are $8 or less.

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:24.280
And that is, for me, that is what is key.

01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:29.280
He's got to get the message out that yes, it's a $250 system, but the games are never

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:31.360
going to be over $8, ever.

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:36.640
And I think if he can get that out there, that will be what brings in the people that

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:38.340
don't usually get into games.

01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:42.280
Because I think there are a lot of people out there that go, games are $60, I don't

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:44.800
want to buy $60 for a game, that's too damn expensive.

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:45.800
I can't afford that.

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:50.800
Especially if they're pushing to put games up to $70 and you have all the DLC and stuff,

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:53.120
then yeah, that'll look really attractive.

01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:59.600
Ooh, I love this point from Pixel Pacas in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:04.640
Rock Band Beatles sold hardcore when they had it on QVC.

01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:07.600
Not that Rock Band had issues selling to begin with, though.

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:12.980
That's a great example of messaging in a place where you wouldn't expect to see it.

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:17.400
Or you wouldn't, like as a gaming hardcore fan or what at mid-core, we wouldn't expect,

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:20.120
oh, they sell video game consoles on QVC?

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:21.400
Intellivision Amico?

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:26.900
I hope Tommy's got QVC on speed dial and is booking his appearance on QVC.

01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:29.200
That's a great idea, honestly.

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:33.680
VG Realness in chat, hmm, that's going to be a challenging sell, I feel.

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:38.020
Why do I need to pay $250 for a system that only has $8 games?

01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:40.320
It's going to be a mixed message to some people.

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:43.560
So again, I think that message is going to be key.

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:47.560
So I doubt Tommy listens to every little thing on the Intellivision, but if he's listening

01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:50.400
to this, I think that is your key need.

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:56.720
You've got to be able to make people clearly understand the games are $8 or less.

01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:01.480
And you've got to convince the soccer moms and the QVC watchers and the Kelly Clarkson

01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:03.720
daytime talk show watchers and all that.

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:06.760
So all right, let's move on.

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:11.640
We got a lot more stories to cover, including something a little near and dear to our heart.

01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:16.760
Speaking of the retro games, I suppose, of sorts that we used to play, things that Orange

01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:19.600
Lounge Radio were founded on, right?

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:21.720
Yeah, indeed.

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:26.840
And this actually is going to be coming for PC, at least what it sounds like.

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:36.920
So there is an alpha of a famous Bimani series, one that we love, that's going to be coming

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:43.400
to PC, and that is Gitarora, as in Guitar Freaks and Dramania.

01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:47.800
There is an open alpha that's available for anyone with the Japanese Konami ID, that needs

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:53.280
to have to find mine, and they're talking about it's probably going to be a subscription.

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:59.120
There's only four songs in the alpha right now, two have them have classic charts from

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:06.300
original Gitarora, and then they're also supporting guitar controllers and electric drum sets.

01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:11.640
So it'd be nice, I mean, I think it would, you know, it's a really neat thing, it's definitely

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:15.040
a way to bring that back now, especially for people who can't really get the arcade

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:20.520
experience anymore, and there'd be people who miss it, honestly enough, you know, Rockman's

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:23.400
kind of dead for now.

01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:26.160
And SSG 100 Matt says, I hope this isn't a beat and groovy situation.

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:27.160
It's not.

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:34.160
The fact that it's coming out in the Japanese market is different.

01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:38.560
Yeah, they're not trying to dumb it down for the US like they did beat and groovy.

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:40.560
Yeah, which is insulting.

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:47.720
But anyway, and other news related to that, there's gonna there is a pro arcade accurate

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:53.200
controller that you can order for release when this when the game's available called

01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:55.960
the key teller.

01:20:55.960 --> 01:21:07.600
And it is a white guitar with a brown neck, it looks pretty neat, has the switches and

01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:10.040
everything.

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:18.080
And this is, it looks pretty neat, you know, I'm not I'm not gonna complain about it.

01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:22.880
It looking at the pictures of it as it's being held, it looks like it'd be nice and comfortable,

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:28.120
you know, maybe I'd say a little bit more like what the rock band controllers are, I

01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:33.120
think they're a little bit a little bit more on on line with that one.

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:35.860
It only is a PC one.

01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:46.260
It's coming from the, the specialist controller, sorry, it's a it's a group that does specialty

01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:50.020
rhythm game controllers, DJ Dow.

01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:52.900
And so it looks, it looks really cool.

01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:57.020
We get, we get a pretty accurate controller, I think that's gonna be neat, although what

01:21:57.020 --> 01:22:03.060
I'm probably gonna end up doing if I go for all of this is get maybe the, the port converter

01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:09.500
for my, my current guitars, because you know, I've still got all of my bimani stuff, all

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:15.140
of it, you know, and all of it, I'm Jason kind of name checked in the intro tonight

01:22:15.140 --> 01:22:20.000
that this is kind of the latest PC iteration of what is kind of in a long line of bimani

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.220
games making their way to PC, right?

01:22:22.220 --> 01:22:29.620
Because we had Infinitas, we had the sound voltex had a PC version, a DDR, the DDR one.

01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:33.000
And so it makes sense that this is happening.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:39.240
I still feel disappointment that they aren't trying in Yes, I know I can go make a Japanese

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:40.620
account and do all this stuff.

01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:43.880
I just wish Konami loved me a little more.

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:46.360
Like why doesn't daddy love me?

01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:52.040
That's how I feel about Konami these days like it's like why will Konami not like put

01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:57.420
the minimal resources to try to give this a US release, especially when these games

01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:02.220
are at round one arcades, which yes, I know we're not going to right now in a pandemic,

01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:04.220
but someday we'll go back.

01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:09.780
You know, and I'm just hoping like, again, I would love to be able to play these games

01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:15.060
and know that it's in the US it's licensed for the US it's something I'm or it doesn't

01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:17.700
like it's region free would really be the most ideal thing.

01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:20.580
I'm not trying to sound like America, no one else.

01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:21.580
I'm not trying to do that.

01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:29.180
I'm just trying to say like, I wish it was open to all and made for all you know, what

01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:35.960
I want to see is having the American market taken seriously again, like how it was going

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:40.780
with when DDR was really reaching its popularity over here.

01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:44.900
Although it makes sense with this being developed by the Japanese division that all the testing

01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:46.180
would be in Japan.

01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:51.460
So I'm not really I'm not really I'm sure I'm trying to let it go a little

01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:52.460
bit because you're right.

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:56.100
And this was the same point that was brought up when I when I because I you know, I screamed

01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:57.100
about the DDR thing.

01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:58.780
I was so mad about it.

01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:03.900
And you know, yeah, if it's an alpha or beta, and they're only testing in Japan, okay, cool,

01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:04.900
whatever.

01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:06.300
It would be still nice.

01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:11.900
It would be nice if dad would call me and say I'm sorry, it would be nice.

01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:19.040
If Konami Daddy would call and say, Son, I'm sorry, I'm not going to see you this year.

01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:22.680
But I plan to see you next year.

01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:27.360
Can't Konami make a phone call and say we're working on it?

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:29.080
That's all I want.

01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:31.080
A Christmas card.

01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:38.040
All right, anything else?

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:42.040
I think daddy needs to be spanked.

01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:45.720
That's been a bad daddy.

01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:46.720
Okay.

01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:49.280
You're gonna get us a ban on Twitch for 24 hours.

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:50.280
You better be careful.

01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:51.280
All right.

01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:55.360
Hey, you're the one to bring it up daddy into this.

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:59.680
All right, moving on to our next story quickly.

01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:00.680
Loki.

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:02.120
All right.

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:11.920
So another thing that was kind of this came out around the time of the PlayStation.

01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:18.720
Their little event was a another exclusive character that's going to be coming to Marvel's

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:25.360
Avengers on the PlayStation, Spider-Man will be exclusive to Marvel Avengers.

01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:34.320
And it is probably because that Sony has this, you know, the rights to Spider-Man licensed

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:35.960
for like movies and stuff.

01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:40.760
So I'm sure that they have it also on the console side as well with their exclusive

01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:42.120
games and whatnot.

01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:49.340
So apparently it'll be a free update for PlayStation players that's coming out when the game comes

01:25:49.340 --> 01:25:57.520
out in, I guess, early 2021 is when I guess, yeah, and then apparently, yeah, I'm sorry.

01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:01.840
So it's going to be exclusive to the PlayStation in September.

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:08.960
And then apparently PC and Xbox One players won't get to actually play as that character.

01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:11.680
So I don't know.

01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:13.120
That's such a major character.

01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:15.600
It's kind of irritating that that's the case.

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:19.200
But I get it, I guess, because they have the rights to it.

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:24.480
But the way I look at it, it's not necessarily that you're basically selling me like an inferior

01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:31.400
product then on the other platforms is the way I look at that, which is kind of annoying.

01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:34.720
This shit has happened before, though, and it was annoying that, well, I don't know.

01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:36.880
It's sometimes annoying and sometimes not.

01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:39.440
I'm actually going to give you an example of when it's not annoying.

01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:41.320
And that was Soul Calibur 2.

01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:42.320
Now that's a throwback.

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:43.320
That one's different, though.

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:44.320
Yeah, that was.

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:45.320
Yeah.

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:46.320
Everybody kind of had.

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:47.320
Yeah.

01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:48.320
Everybody kind of had their own thing.

01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:51.400
Well, do we know that that will be maybe Microsoft will get their own hero?

01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:52.600
No, I doubt it.

01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:53.600
I doubt.

01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:55.800
I mean, right now they haven't announced anything.

01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:58.440
So I mean, it would be cool if that was the case.

01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:03.280
I just don't think that there is anything right now.

01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:04.280
I don't know.

01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:06.480
It's stupid politics.

01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:12.760
DGRama S says, and Xbox fans are trying to get a petition going to block that exclusive.

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:13.760
Lol.

01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:15.520
There's always a fucking change.org for anything.

01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:16.520
Let's see.

01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:20.560
Quest Buster in chat says Avengers has a closed preorder beta going on.

01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:21.920
I've seen some streams of it.

01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:24.000
I have some concerns.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.880
That was my general kind of feedback is I don't know that this news is a great thing

01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:32.560
for this game because I can't help.

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:37.440
And I want to just clearly say didn't watch any of the beta streams, haven't played a

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:38.440
look at the game.

01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:42.960
I have I'm in no position to judge this game, whether it's a good game or not.

01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:51.080
I can't shake this shaking feeling, this sinking feeling that this game is doomed.

01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:57.080
I hear it like I hear people aren't really impressed with the beta so far, so I don't

01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:58.080
know.

01:27:58.080 --> 01:27:59.280
I'm just going to wait for it to come out.

01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:00.480
It looked interesting at first.

01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:06.880
And then when I saw the trailer, it's kind of to me looking more like like Elder Scrolls

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:11.400
online where like the more trailers and the more information I hear about it, the less

01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:13.320
excited about it I am.

01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:19.160
So right now I'm kind of like, eh, it just looks like an average action game.

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:21.960
I mean, we'll see.

01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:22.960
I don't know.

01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:29.280
I just there's a lot of games for me to play and especially with like Cyberpunk right around

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:30.280
the corner.

01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:32.080
So I don't really care.

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:40.600
Yeah, I just I this is just some not good news on top of the pile of I have like I have

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:43.240
anthem kinds of concerns for this game.

01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:44.640
Let's just put it that way.

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:46.000
Sorry about that.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.600
I'm not there yet, but yeah, it's.

01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:50.600
We'll see.

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:51.600
Yeah, we'll see.

01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:52.600
All right.

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:56.720
Well, if you are still if you're still Team Microsoft, which there's no problem, there's

01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:58.120
plenty of reasons to be Team Microsoft.

01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:00.200
Oh, I want to read this comment real fast.

01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:03.480
VG realness and chat says, I was already met about the game.

01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:06.880
Now the announcement about Spider-Man, I'm just very met about it.

01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:08.800
I feel like it needs more character options.

01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:11.160
I don't feel like playing the ones they have.

01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:12.840
Not enough diversity in the characters.

01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:14.800
They're all punchy, punchy, throwy, throwy.

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:21.320
OK, not all, but most pod culture says Mr. Smoosh is the Xbox exclusive character.

01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:22.320
We could dream.

01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:23.320
We could dream.

01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:24.320
All right.

01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:26.840
Anyway, I want to talk a little bit, though, about what's going on on the Microsoft side

01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:30.600
of things, because even if they don't have exclusive content for the Avengers yet, they

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:36.640
do have something pretty big happening on September 15th, and that is Project X Cloud.

01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:41.840
Project X Cloud is going to be launching on September 15th on Android devices.

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:45.600
There is some controversy definitely going around because apparently Apple is not allowing

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:47.200
it through.

01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:52.340
We'll see if they'll work that out by September 15th, because, again, and I'll kind of let

01:29:52.340 --> 01:29:54.040
Bobby show kind of speak to this.

01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:57.880
I feel like if Spotify got their way eventually, Netflix got their way eventually, I feel like

01:29:57.880 --> 01:29:59.440
this is going to get worked out, too.

01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:03.760
But as it stands, it's only coming out on Android devices on September 15th.

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:09.320
An Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription.

01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:13.840
So not if you are PC only and not if you are Xbox only.

01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:17.520
You have to have an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription.

01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:22.400
So if you have this, it will allow you to unlock the game streaming on X Cloud.

01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:29.400
Ultimate, of course, will set you back $15 a month after initial offers to get you hooked.

01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:35.840
Over I guess 100 games are going to be included, but they're not saying the whole library yet.

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:38.960
But that could also be because games come and go on Game Pass.

01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:39.960
Don't know about that.

01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:40.960
Yeah, probably.

01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:47.920
I don't think that they're, like, blocking anything unless there's, like, I don't think

01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:51.560
there has been unless there's, like, somebody that has, like, I have exclusive streaming

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:57.560
rights with, like, the Nvidia platform or whatever it is, or like EA, you know, like,

01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:00.640
we want our own streaming platform, which I think they have their own streaming ones

01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:01.640
that they're trying to do.

01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:04.480
Maybe they're like, well, we don't want you to stream our games or something.

01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:09.320
Regardless, I think it's pretty safe to say all the Microsoft Game Studio stuff is not

01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:10.320
going to be a problem.

01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:11.920
And that's that's your halos.

01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:13.320
That's your Gears of War.

01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:16.240
That's your Fable reboot and all this stuff.

01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:19.240
That's that's what a lot of people are going to be checking out anyway.

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:20.800
You know, so we'll see.

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:22.680
We'll see what kind of slips through the cracks otherwise.

01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:26.240
Now, X Cloud is also supposed to be coming to PC later this year.

01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:30.160
So you'll be able to stream game pass titles to desktop or laptop, which is weird because

01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:32.640
you can download a lot of the same games.

01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:36.020
But I understand, you know, just based on people's setup or what have you, they might

01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:39.160
want to stream to like a laptop or or who knows what.

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:44.240
So yeah, we'll have to check that out when X Cloud comes out on September 15th.

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:45.760
So we'll see.

01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:49.480
I know a lot of people that have been playing with the early beta and stuff speak very favorably

01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:50.480
of it.

01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:54.040
So I'm curious to try it myself and see how it works out.

01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:59.240
Or those fancy new phones that are being released as well, you know, what do you mean you stream

01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:00.240
to those?

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:01.240
Oh, yeah.

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:02.240
Yeah.

01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:03.240
So.

01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:04.240
All right.

01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:05.240
I think.

01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:06.240
Are you going to go Dark Sakura?

01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:07.240
I know you had a little spill there.

01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:08.240
So you're you're cleaning off cam.

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:09.240
OK.

01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:16.280
I have some older kimono fabric that got soda on it, which means it went right in the gentle

01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:17.280
cycle.

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:18.280
Yikes.

01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:19.280
Yikes.

01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:20.280
All right.

01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:22.080
All right.

01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:26.840
Meanwhile, let's get to the classic game of the week then where every week here on the

01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:33.080
show, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, kids,

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.080
get off my lawn.

01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:35.320
Number one.

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:38.800
Number two, watch me do a trick on this hill.

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:42.560
Number three, go check out this classic game where she's going to walk into the gaming

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:46.840
vault and find a game that she thinks all the kids should be checking out.

01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:48.840
And I have a few copies of it.

01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:51.800
And I think this one is one that a lot of our listeners will remember.

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:53.600
This is a very transformative kind of game.

01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:55.600
What is the classic game of the week?

01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:58.440
Classic game is Virtua Racing.

01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:04.240
So you've also seen it as VR, but it is a Formula One racing arcade game that was developed

01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:07.940
by Sega and two and released in 1992.

01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:13.880
It was originally considered to be a proof of concept for trying 3D graphics, which was

01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:18.560
supposed to be under the Model 1 because it looked so good.

01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:27.560
They actually fully developed it as a standalone title and it was full 3D, which I mean, MAMCO

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:28.560
did it first.

01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:31.600
They did winning run and then Atari had hard drive in.

01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:37.180
But this was like a vast improvement over those.

01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:43.480
It actually ran relatively smoothly in 3D and it pretty much is considered the foundational

01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:52.240
game for 3D racing games in general and for using polygon graphics for games going forward.

01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:53.240
Yeah.

01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:58.480
I mean, looking at the footage of this game that we're watching on Twitch, to hear you

01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:03.000
say this is 1992, that's the early days of the Super Nintendo.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.680
So it's like putting this side by side with F-Zero is it's like, dang, these graphics

01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:07.680
are real.

01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:09.260
But I also remember this arcade game.

01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:12.680
This was like you had to pay a whole dollar to play this game.

01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:17.720
It was not a cheap arcade game, you know, and it maybe it's probably showing its warts

01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:21.560
all these years later, like the draw, you know, things kind of pop in, the draw distance

01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:22.560
isn't amazing, all that.

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:30.440
But again, if you put it in your 1992 hat, like this game for its time was transformative.

01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:33.320
This is what led to Grand Theft Auto and everything else.

01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:34.320
Sorry, go ahead.

01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:41.500
Well, and even for the games that followed, I mean, like Sega Rally, for example, Daytona,

01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:47.540
you know, while those were all textured, you know, this one here is in its beautiful

01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:49.680
raw and textured glory.

01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:52.600
And this is, you know, what we had.

01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:57.340
I was playing this when I was in 10th grade, so, you know, I sucked at it.

01:34:57.340 --> 01:35:02.380
But at any rate, the original arcade game had three levels with its difficulty.

01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:06.540
So you had the beginner, which is big, big forest, and then you had the Bay Bridge as

01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:11.560
the intermediate, and then your expert level was the Acropolis.

01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:17.000
And then each of them had their own feature, like an amusement park in a big forest or

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:21.380
the bridge for Bay Bridge or the hairpin turns on Acropolis.

01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:26.560
So when you select a car, you've got your transit transmission types, you know, your

01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:28.160
automatic or your standard.

01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:34.780
You also have the VR view system that lets you choose four different views for the game.

01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:42.300
It was used in a lot of other Sega racing games like Daytona, and it even was in the

01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:47.300
home ports, which we're going to get to in a moment, please.

01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:52.960
So as for the cabinets, there were a few different cabinet versions there.

01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:55.800
There was a twin cabinet, which was the standard one.

01:35:55.800 --> 01:36:01.080
It was effectively two arcade machines built into one cabinet.

01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:08.160
And these were, you know, pretty, pretty widespread for these.

01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:15.900
However, there was a, there's zenith picture tubes in the Wells Gardner 25 inch monitors

01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:20.560
actually ended up having a manufacturing defect that caused them to fail after a few years.

01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:27.300
So many of those machines were either parted out and they're a lot harder to find today.

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:35.160
The twin cabinet sold everywhere else was used the 29 inch 9L monitors.

01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:40.100
So you won't find those, those older ones that much anymore, but they were the first

01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:41.100
releases.

01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:42.100
They were the common ones at first.

01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:48.460
There's also the deluxe version, which is the VRDX cabinet type, which is a single player

01:36:48.460 --> 01:36:55.580
machine and has a 16, nine aspect ratio, a Hantrex monitor, which was one of the first

01:36:55.580 --> 01:37:02.980
uses of widescreen aspect ratio monitors in an arcade game, six airbags.

01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:10.380
So one on each side, or three on each side that would inflate so that you would be nudged

01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:15.500
when you're cornering or move the airbag to, you know, pull you back while you're breaking.

01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:22.980
So it's supposed to give you the, that feeling of motion and resistance.

01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:31.620
And as for a few other things, it also had a fully adjustable forward and back seat that

01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:33.340
used the air pressure for it.

01:37:33.340 --> 01:37:40.100
It also had a force feedback steering that used a two pneumatic cylinders to rotate the

01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:43.680
steering wheel, which was different than the electric motor and clutch system that were

01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:46.020
used before.

01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:50.180
So the steering would feel a little bit more true to life.

01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:57.740
And Virtual Formula ended up being released in 1993, and it was unveiled at the Sega's

01:37:57.740 --> 01:38:04.620
second arcade amusement park, Joypolis, and there was a room with 32 machines dedicated

01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:05.620
to it.

01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:14.140
So Virtual Formula was a Super DX version of VR, and it put you in a full motion hydraulic

01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:19.620
Formula One car replica in front of a 50 inch screen.

01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:27.380
And a lot of these units were converted into their IndyCar simulator, Indy 500 found at

01:38:27.380 --> 01:38:30.120
Sega Gameworks in the US.

01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:34.220
And I think that we saw one at, I think there was one at the Gameworks in Seattle when we

01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:36.220
were there.

01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:39.760
Yes, there was.

01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:46.920
And on top of that, I believe that these same overall cabinets I've seen used for Daytona,

01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:52.660
and it was, yeah, I think it was roughly around that same time.

01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:56.800
They had similar for Daytona, because it was the first time I saw Daytona at the Sega arcade

01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:06.640
at, crap, what's that casino called that's Egyptian themed in Las Vegas, Luxor, Luxor,

01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:07.640
thank you.

01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:08.640
At Luxor.

01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:13.480
And that was roughly around the same time I was, I was in high school I think, yeah.

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:14.480
I just want to comment.

01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:15.480
They were all like cars.

01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:18.160
I just want to comment on the video again real quick, which sorry to the podcast listeners,

01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:22.480
but we're watching another level, and this is the Bay Bridge level, which is really the

01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:23.560
Golden Gate.

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:27.200
But I'm always fascinated, which obviously the geography is completely wrong, it's just

01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:29.520
an excuse to put something that looks like the Golden Gate in the game.

01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:31.400
That doesn't look like Sausalito.

01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:36.640
But it's, and it's not nearly long enough, but the funny thing is racing games always

01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:38.920
have a fascination with San Francisco.

01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:43.080
Like San Francisco like always, and it's because of the hills, it's because of the iconic-ness

01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:46.480
of the Golden Gate, so it's interesting to see it in this game too, because I feel like

01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:47.480
every...

01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:49.480
Have you seen a windmill in San Francisco?

01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:50.480
A what?

01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:51.480
A windmill in San Francisco.

01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:53.160
No, yeah, there's no windmills in San Francisco.

01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:59.360
So some of this stuff is very random, but it's fine, like you know, again, it's just

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:03.600
invoking those sorts of images and making you think of that.

01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:04.600
Yeah.

01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:10.400
Going back to all the cabinets for Virtua Racing, they're linkable for up to eight players,

01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:15.720
so four twin units, or eight DX, UR, or Virtua Formula cabinets can be linked together, and

01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:18.000
they use fiber optic cables for this.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:22.760
There was also an optional display called the Live Monitor that would sit atop the cabinets

01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:28.280
and replay action shots of what was happening in the game with kind of like a virtual sportscast

01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:32.200
with a commentator named Vert McPolygon.

01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:33.800
Yeah.

01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:34.800
I know.

01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:40.560
So anyway, for the home console versions, now I'm gonna be a little bit more verbose

01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:46.800
about the Sega Mega Drive or Genesis as we had it here in the US.

01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:53.360
This one was honestly, when this came out, it was big shit, okay?

01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:59.720
They couldn't do the game because of how complex the Model 1 board was, they think they were

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:06.280
gonna be able to do a home console version, but in 1994, they created a cartridge design

01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:14.480
that used the Sega Virtua processor, which basically is an extra chip that enabled you

01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:18.360
to play a version like this on the Mega Drive, on the Genesis.

01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:20.520
It was really expensive.

01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:27.920
So the games, when they came out, they were 100 bucks, it was 70 pounds in the UK.

01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:32.080
And for what it did at the time, it was pretty amazing.

01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:39.280
It rendered 9,000 polygons per second in game, which was much higher than anything the Genesis

01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:41.800
was capable of at the time otherwise.

01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:48.840
However, you cannot use this on the Majesco Genesis 3, and it will not work on any Genesis

01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:53.400
that's equipped with a 32X, for obvious reasons.

01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:58.760
Now speaking of the 32X, yeah, there was a pretty awesome port, Virtua Racing Deluxe,

01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:02.760
which is pretty fun, and it was developed directly by Sega AM2.

01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:09.000
It was published by Sega under Sega Sports, and it performed very closely to the arcade

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:13.560
version and had two extra cars, one called Stock and the other prototype, and two new

01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:16.760
tracks that were called Highland and Sand Park.

01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:22.240
Now of course, the good version, the one that was at the time the most accurate one that

01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:25.040
you could get was the Sega Saturn.

01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:29.800
It was, the working title was Virtua Racing Saturn, it was released in 1995, and it was

01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:32.480
developed and published by Time Warner.

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:41.120
Of course, you could put the CD in and play the game, like the music as long as you skipped

01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:43.800
the tracks, because it was all red book audio.

01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:50.200
I've got rips of the audio somewhere, and unlike the other versions, it has a Grand

01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:56.120
Prix mode, where you're driving a series of cars and tracks to earn your points as

01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:57.840
you go along.

01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:04.160
And then there was a remake called Virtua Racing Flatout on PS2, it was released under

01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:10.360
the Sega Ages 2500 label, it was released in Japan in 2004, and did get an American

01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:15.420
and European release in 2005 as part of the Sega Classics collection, had three new courses

01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:17.080
and four new cars.

01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:21.880
And now, and you know, we're seeing more of these Sega Ages ports now on the Switch,

01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:27.760
so yes, there is a Virtua Racing for Switch, and it was released on April 24th, 2019 in

01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:32.080
Japan and elsewhere June 27th, 2019, developed by M2.

01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:37.120
It is an absolute port of the arcade original, with an increased frame rate of 60 frames

01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:40.760
per second, and in the 69 aspect ratio.

01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:45.320
You can play online with up to two players, and up to eight players on a single system.

01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:52.440
It also has online leaderboards, downloadable replays for the top 50 players on each track,

01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:57.520
an easier steering option, and the Grand Prix mode that increases the total number of laps

01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:01.240
to 20, and guess who's back?

01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:02.240
Vert McPolygon!

01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:03.240
Yay!

01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:07.040
He cameos in the replay.

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:08.040
Love it.

01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:11.840
So, it was very well received.

01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:19.760
It was listed in their 1992 issue in October of Game Machine as their most successful upright

01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:26.760
arcade unit of the year, and it was also very well accepted, of course, here in the US.

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:31.040
The Japanese Gamest Awards, it was nominated for Best Action, Best Direction, Best Graphics,

01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:35.200
then it lost to Street Fighter II Champion Edition, and then Art of Fighting, and then

01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:40.080
Zexus, which Zexus and, of course, Street Fighter II have been past classic games.

01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:42.320
I don't know if I've done Art of Fighting.

01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:43.320
Maybe.

01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:48.920
EGM called it a racing masterpiece and said, life-like racing sensations are extremely

01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:50.880
impressive and exciting.

01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:53.560
So yeah, it really got good reviews.

01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:57.760
The home versions got pretty great reviews.

01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:05.000
GamePro loved the 32X version, and they said, actually, that it addressed the longevity

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:10.280
of the Genesis version with adding more stuff and giving it a little bit more replay value.

01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:16.800
And it was for, in 1994, it was on Mega's list of, it was fourth place on Mega's list

01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:21.320
for top Mega Drive games of all time.

01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:27.400
And so, yeah, I'm really surprised I haven't done it before, but, you know, kind of on

01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:32.080
this AM2 kick, so there you go, Virtua Racing.

01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:33.080
Classic game of the week.

01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:34.560
Virtua Racing.

01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:39.120
One that I think many people in their 30s and maybe even like late 20s probably remember

01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:44.280
seeing this game in an arcade somewhere and how cool it looked at the time.

01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:51.720
And yeah, now it's being revisited all over again by us here at OLR.

01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:59.560
So some comments on the use of San Francisco, oftentimes in racing games, we're talking

01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:01.000
about that in chat a little bit.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:06.320
Bobby Blackwolf pointed out probably also because many gaming companies are in San Francisco,

01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:08.720
and I was like, oh yeah, Sega used to be in San Francisco.

01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:13.000
They used to have that iconic building where 80 and 101 kind of met, and the Golden Gate

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.000
is 101.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.320
I mean, you have to kind of go through the city to get to that part of it, but still

01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:19.160
like, you know, Sega had that iconic building.

01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:20.160
It's no longer there.

01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:23.240
It's the Zynga, or was the Zynga building, I don't even know if they're still in it,

01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:24.240
but you...

01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:25.240
I don't think so.

01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:26.240
I think they're out.

01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:30.660
Yeah, you couldn't miss that Sega logo when you used to go by there all the time.

01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:35.160
And then Dark Tetsuya said, oh yeah, that might explain the first crazy taxi.

01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:39.520
Also a Sega game took heavy inspiration from San Francisco as well.

01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:42.980
So interesting point that, you know, with all the development that happens in the Bay

01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:46.900
Area, go with what you know, so to speak, in what you develop.

01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:47.900
That's kind of interesting.

01:46:47.900 --> 01:46:51.340
I just always thought it was because of the hills, you know, people wanted to do...

01:46:51.340 --> 01:46:54.740
Because everybody fantasizes about going 100 miles an hour on those hills, which is something

01:46:54.740 --> 01:46:59.540
you should never do in a real car, Jesus, like those hills are actually not fun in a

01:46:59.540 --> 01:47:00.540
car.

01:47:00.620 --> 01:47:05.020
Without the experience being in a car with me going about 90 doing a spin in San Francisco.

01:47:05.020 --> 01:47:12.660
The hills in San Francisco are the most overrated part of San Francisco, to be real.

01:47:12.660 --> 01:47:16.580
They're beautiful, especially when you're looking out from Alcatraz, but...

01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:17.580
There's a story.

01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:21.420
DJ Ramis just put three dots in chat, so I'm not sure he wants to see this.

01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:22.420
It's called an ellipsis.

01:47:22.420 --> 01:47:23.420
It's still.

01:47:23.420 --> 01:47:24.420
It's called an ellipsis.

01:47:24.420 --> 01:47:29.440
Anyway, I wanted to take him to Charger Island.

01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:32.960
And so I was just about to miss the turn, and this was the Lancer.

01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:40.040
So I effectively drifted going on that on ramp to Treasure Island.

01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:41.040
It was pretty fun.

01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:42.040
Yeah.

01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:43.040
Good times.

01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:46.320
I'm glad we lived, and I'm glad I didn't get a ticket.

01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:51.440
But I'll give you my little San Francisco trick for all those of you guys that ever

01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:52.760
want to go visit.

01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:59.120
The easiest way to get around San Francisco, take your car, park it on top of a hill in

01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:03.480
a neighborhood, because all the parking's free on the street at the top of a hill,

01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:06.680
because nobody wants to park there and walk up and down a hill.

01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:08.700
And then take Uber or Lyft wherever you need to go.

01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:10.680
It's gonna be cheaper than parking.

01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:13.960
That is my tired and true how I get around San Francisco.

01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:20.640
Or, I mean, even better than that, even better, get yourself a clipper.

01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:25.040
Yeah, I was gonna say, find a friend that knows that transit system like the back of

01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:26.040
his hand.

01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:28.520
You don't need anyone to do it for you.

01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:32.560
My iPhone will just tell me what buses to take in San Francisco.

01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:34.240
I'll still get on the wrong one.

01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:36.040
I'm bad, though, with the trains.

01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:37.960
I'm bad with the trains right now.

01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:38.960
Right.

01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:39.960
All right.

01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:42.240
Usually, I get JD to help me.

01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:43.240
All right.

01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:44.240
Let's move on.

01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:48.680
Let's get into some rapid fire news and quickly talk about some other news going on in the

01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:49.680
industry.

01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:50.680
Loki.

01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:57.440
Well, I'm relieved that even though we talked about a game-breaking bug in Paper Mario Origami

01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:00.400
King that they're already patching it.

01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:07.520
And so, as of right now, patch 101 is available, and it'll actually fix the issue that they

01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:14.360
had in the Spring of Rainbows and Shangri-Spa, and along with other issues that were apparently

01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:17.360
blocking progress in the game as well.

01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:18.680
So, that's a relief.

01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:24.360
Now, I can finish my game as soon as I get the console back from everybody in my household.

01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:30.640
Also, coming to the Switch, Pikmin 3 Deluxe, which was an announcement that happened.

01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:33.800
Apparently, it's coming October 30th.

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:38.680
Can we get a different game instead than Pikmin?

01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:43.040
I mean, really, can we not get another Pikmin game, please?

01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:48.360
Yeah, I'm not a big Pikmin person either, but cool for those that are.

01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:54.000
I know some people were really excited about it, so yay for you.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:59.560
I'm guessing we'll be getting more announcements for more games coming to the Switch later.

01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:03.560
I think this is definitely a Band-Aid.

01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:07.080
Yeah, that's it.

01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:11.040
Alright, then for what I was going to talk about, I have a couple quick stories here.

01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:14.720
So, Loki kind of spoiled this one already earlier in the show, but that's okay, because

01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:17.360
we'll talk about it outside of just PlayStation.

01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:21.880
Braid Anniversary Edition, which Loki brought up earlier, is also coming to the Nintendo

01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:22.880
Switch.

01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:28.720
So, this new version of the game is going to have some new mixes and an upgraded soundtrack,

01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:29.720
if you will.

01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:34.480
It will have some hand-repainted graphics, some all-new animation, and you can switch

01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:36.960
back and forth between the old and the new Braid.

01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:41.920
So, it sounds like the Wonder Boy monster's trap and those types of games where you have

01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:44.360
the button to switch back and forth, which is always cool.

01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:47.240
They're also talking about extensive developer commentary.

01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:52.820
So, maybe we'll find out if the ending is supposed to be deeper than the fact that you

01:50:52.820 --> 01:50:53.820
were the...

01:50:53.820 --> 01:50:57.900
I guess I shouldn't spoil it for those that still haven't played it after 12 years, but

01:50:57.900 --> 01:50:59.900
it's a pretty...

01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:02.580
It is a game, you know, I don't know.

01:51:02.580 --> 01:51:05.940
I feel like this game kind of has some mixed things, because I think some people saw that

01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:10.260
movie and so they...

01:51:10.260 --> 01:51:14.700
Not everything about the development of the game was portrayed in a positive light, but

01:51:14.700 --> 01:51:18.620
I know that the critics really loved this game and embraced this game, and it was an

01:51:18.620 --> 01:51:19.620
interesting twist.

01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:20.620
I will say that.

01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:24.460
Even the game mechanics was an interesting twist on the old formulas.

01:51:24.460 --> 01:51:29.100
And you have to remember this game came out when Xbox Live and the whole digital to you

01:51:29.100 --> 01:51:32.120
game thing was really starting to take off.

01:51:32.120 --> 01:51:35.860
So I do think Braid is transformative in many ways for the industry, and it is something

01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:38.460
that I'm not surprised we're revisiting.

01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:39.680
It's just kind of a weird time.

01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:43.820
It's a random time for it, I guess, but okay, whatever.

01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:49.220
Anyway, Fall Guys, which I think is also going to be a big game in our industry, just wait.

01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:53.160
They are talking about bringing the game to other platforms.

01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:58.100
It's an official FAQ on the game's website that talks about, will the game come to Xbox

01:51:58.100 --> 01:51:59.100
or Switch?

01:51:59.100 --> 01:52:02.660
To start with, Fall Guys will only be available on PS4 and Steam.

01:52:02.660 --> 01:52:05.980
We'd love to bring the game to other platforms further down the line.

01:52:05.980 --> 01:52:09.220
Please let us know on Twitter and Discord which platforms you'd like us to release on

01:52:09.220 --> 01:52:10.220
next.

01:52:10.220 --> 01:52:18.700
We'd love to see how much demand there is, which is code, I'm sure, for...

01:52:18.700 --> 01:52:21.980
If you're already on it, please look forward to it.

01:52:21.980 --> 01:52:26.060
All right, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

01:52:26.060 --> 01:52:27.700
Oh, this and that.

01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:31.340
One of them just makes me laugh my ass off, because I'm working on a novel right now,

01:52:31.340 --> 01:52:34.340
so I know how much research goes into writing.

01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:43.500
And this is historical fiction, and there is an author named John Boyne, who's had other

01:52:43.500 --> 01:52:48.040
controversy about him, wrote a historical fiction novel called A Traveler at the Gates

01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:57.200
of Wisdom, and he made a boo-boo in referencing a recipe for red dye.

01:52:57.200 --> 01:53:01.320
And I will read it in all of its glory.

01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:02.320
I will get to it.

01:53:02.320 --> 01:53:05.760
The dyes that I used in my dressmaking were composed from various ingredients depending

01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:10.920
on the color required, but almost all required nightshade, sapphire, key swings, the leaves

01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:16.960
of the silent princess plant, Octorok eyeballs, swift violet thistle, and hightail lizard.

01:53:16.960 --> 01:53:22.600
I employ spicy pepper, tail of the red Lizalfos, and four Hylian shrooms.

01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:25.640
Love it.

01:53:25.640 --> 01:53:30.760
And now, though, I mean, and the screenshot was pointed on Twitter by a writer named Dana

01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:31.760
Schwartz.

01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:38.520
It was actually first posted by somebody else, but they've deactivated their account.

01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:41.040
But it's just, it's absolutely hilarious.

01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:47.960
And so the writer himself, so he, he admitted to it, he's like, and this is the quote from

01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:52.680
his Twitter, hey, Twitter, does anyone know how one would go about dyeing a red dress?

01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:54.680
Asking for a friend.

01:53:54.680 --> 01:54:04.000
Now, of course, Boyne has been in in the news before for other faux pas, big ones, the Auschwitz

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:09.040
Museum stated his book, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas contained many inaccuracies about

01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:12.720
the Holocaust and should not be used as teaching about the genocide.

01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:18.840
And then his novel in 2019, called My Brother's Name is Jessica, has also met with extreme

01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:24.640
criticism from the trans community for misgendering characters, and that he rejected the word

01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:32.080
cis as a controversial term, even though it's a fucking accurate word, so get over it.

01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:41.640
But at any rate, yeah, dude needs to cross reference shit when he's doing research, I

01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:44.640
swear to God, anyway.

01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:48.320
I'm working on my first book and I know better, okay?

01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:57.800
So anywho, we had covered Warner Brothers, the gaming division being up for sale, well,

01:54:57.800 --> 01:54:59.680
that ain't happening now.

01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:07.880
So they have released an amendment saying that they are still their own, they remain

01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:12.880
part of the studio networks group, they are completely still their own entities.

01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:19.600
So yeah, not happening, at least right now.

01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:25.200
All right, well, we're gonna go on to world release dates and travel around the world

01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:27.560
and check out what games are coming out near you soon.

01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:31.520
However, I do need to sneak in one more news item here because it does relate to the Voice

01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:36.000
Geeks Network and some of our personalities here at VOG Network.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:39.760
I want to give a shout out to Bobby Blackwolf because it is actually confirmed.

01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:43.280
And if you've been listening to his show, you've kind of heard about some of this, the

01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:48.300
process he's gone through to get here, but he will be a part of Summer Games Done Quick

01:55:48.300 --> 01:55:49.800
as one of the announcers.

01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:55.000
So he did get, even though he fell in the backup category, it turns out they gave the

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.600
backup hosts one shift, basically.

01:55:57.600 --> 01:55:59.920
So you can check out Bobby Blackwolf.

01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:02.800
He's going to be announcing during Summer Games Done Quick.

01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:07.840
And if you want to check him out, it's going to be Wednesday, August 19th at about 10 Eastern,

01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:08.840
7 Pacific.

01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:11.720
I say about because you never know if the speed runs are going to go short or long or

01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:12.720
whatever.

01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:17.240
But the speed run, he's going to be a host for and doing the, not the commentary because

01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:20.040
the guy on the couch or virtual, it's all virtual, right?

01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:22.200
But the guy actually doing the speed run does the commentary, but he's going to be reading

01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:24.220
the donations and all that stuff.

01:56:24.220 --> 01:56:29.220
That is going to be for Devil May Cry 4 will be the game that he is kind of going to be

01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:31.980
announcing for.

01:56:31.980 --> 01:56:35.740
One thing he wanted to stress though, so I will pass this along as well.

01:56:35.740 --> 01:56:39.380
Summer Games Done Quick is about the charity, Doctors Without Borders.

01:56:39.380 --> 01:56:40.740
It's about the speed runner.

01:56:40.740 --> 01:56:43.180
It is not about Bobby Blackwolf or VOG Network.

01:56:43.180 --> 01:56:47.220
So you're encouraged to go donate and give money and all that good stuff because it is

01:56:47.220 --> 01:56:48.720
a great charity.

01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:53.980
But don't go there donating, going, ah, VOG Network, blah, Bobby Blackwolf, I love you,

01:56:53.980 --> 01:56:56.660
that because he does not want the focus to be on him.

01:56:56.660 --> 01:56:58.680
And in fact, it might actually kind of have a negative effect.

01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:02.160
So it's really about the speed runner and charity.

01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:05.840
So let's focus on those things and let's just be thrilled that we kind of like, you know,

01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:09.020
we already kind of knew somebody there because I know Jason's been volunteering for a little

01:57:09.020 --> 01:57:12.420
while and now it's like, now we know somebody that will see like on the stream too.

01:57:12.420 --> 01:57:16.500
So that's really cool how more and more folks here at VOG Network are getting involved with

01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:17.500
that.

01:57:17.500 --> 01:57:21.380
So I will definitely try to check out that stream next Wednesday, so not this coming

01:57:21.380 --> 01:57:24.260
Wednesday, but next Wednesday, and I think that's really cool.

01:57:24.260 --> 01:57:25.260
So congrats, Bobby.

01:57:25.260 --> 01:57:26.260
All right.

01:57:26.260 --> 01:57:31.100
And congrats to Summer Games Done Quick for still doing a marathon, even in this whole

01:57:31.100 --> 01:57:36.180
pandemic situation and making the necessary adjustments to the virtual thing to do it.

01:57:36.180 --> 01:57:39.180
And I still think they're going to raise a lot of money and it's going to be a great

01:57:39.180 --> 01:57:42.900
thing, especially for an organization that could probably use it right now with a fucking

01:57:42.900 --> 01:57:48.060
pandemic going on right now, because even though America might have this thing under

01:57:48.060 --> 01:57:53.580
control by 2021 and some of the other, you know, big nations and so forth, there's going

01:57:53.580 --> 01:57:57.420
to be a lot of countries on the planet that don't have this COVID thing worked out in

01:57:57.420 --> 01:57:59.700
2021 yet.

01:57:59.700 --> 01:58:04.060
And so, you know, an organization like Doctors Without Borders is going to be very instrumental

01:58:04.060 --> 01:58:08.740
in making sure that COVID doesn't spread in other countries as well.

01:58:08.740 --> 01:58:10.340
So very cool.

01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:11.340
All right.

01:58:11.340 --> 01:58:12.340
Yeah.

01:58:12.340 --> 01:58:13.420
And that's Joe and I'm out with a good tip.

01:58:13.420 --> 01:58:19.100
If you want to support Bobby, donate for the host announcer choice of donation incentive.

01:58:19.100 --> 01:58:23.900
So that's another thing you can do there is let him choose the donation incentive.

01:58:23.900 --> 01:58:24.900
Okay.

01:58:24.900 --> 01:58:25.900
That shout out being done.

01:58:25.900 --> 01:58:28.500
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:58:28.500 --> 01:58:29.500
Loki.

01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:31.020
All right.

01:58:31.020 --> 01:58:36.620
So in the U.S., we have a few games coming out, starting off with Hyper Scape on PC,

01:58:36.620 --> 01:58:39.400
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:58:39.400 --> 01:58:45.240
We have Risk of Rain 2 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:49.880
Caller Across Malice Unlimited on Nintendo Switch.

01:58:49.880 --> 01:58:54.320
Total War Saga Troy on PC.

01:58:54.320 --> 01:59:00.880
And then we have EA Sports UFC 4 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:02.600
That's it.

01:59:02.600 --> 01:59:05.040
All right.

01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:07.200
I'm slow in bringing up the Japanese releases.

01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:10.160
Can we go out of order and do the U.K. next, Dark Sakura?

01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:11.160
Sure.

01:59:11.160 --> 01:59:13.280
It's only a handful on the 13th.

01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:16.240
We have UFC 4.

01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:18.600
We have Deliver Us the Moon.

01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:23.160
And then there's also Beholder Collector's Edition for Switch.

01:59:23.160 --> 01:59:24.680
All right.

01:59:24.680 --> 01:59:26.280
So not too much.

01:59:26.280 --> 01:59:27.280
Yeah.

01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:29.200
It's kind of a slower week in Japan as well.

01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:33.560
So looking at the releases over there on the Nintendo Switch, we have Ancestors Legacy

01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:34.880
on August 11th.

01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:37.880
And that is the only release on the Switch.

01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:46.400
Taking a look at the PlayStation 4, we have EA Sports UFC 4 gets a Japanese release on

01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:48.120
the 14th.

01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:49.780
And otherwise, that's it.

01:59:49.780 --> 01:59:51.880
It's a pretty slow week in Japan as well.

01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:54.560
So there's your release dates around the world.

01:59:54.560 --> 01:59:56.480
Our next segment is the mailbag.

01:59:56.480 --> 02:00:01.880
So every week we invite your emails at participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:00:01.880 --> 02:00:04.360
And we read your emails here on the show.

02:00:04.360 --> 02:00:10.320
However, my understanding is Dark Sakura, you went to the mailbag and it was empty.

02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:11.800
It was naked.

02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:13.000
It was born bare.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.300
It was born naked and the rest is drag.

02:00:15.300 --> 02:00:17.400
So that means drag discussion, right?

02:00:17.400 --> 02:00:19.000
I started watching We Are Here.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Oh yeah?

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.000
How's that?

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Yeah.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.000
I only got through the first episode.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.040
I figured I'm going to not binge it.

02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:27.560
I'm just going to do like an episode here and there.

02:00:27.560 --> 02:00:29.680
And oh my gosh, I had some sniffles.

02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:33.040
It was very beautiful and I love Changela even more.

02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:37.640
I haven't met Changela a couple of times who's just the sweetest person in person.

02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:41.160
And I'm really enjoying the show.

02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:45.840
I didn't watch that, but I did watch Muppets Now on Disney Plus.

02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:48.160
And you might think, what does that have to do with drag queens?

02:00:48.160 --> 02:00:51.440
Well, RuPaul's in the first episode, for better or for worse.

02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:55.360
But also I would say that the original drag queen was Miss Piggy.

02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:59.560
Yeah, I could go with that.

02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:02.960
The Miss Piggy parts were the only parts where I was laughing out loud.

02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:06.200
Because I watched the first episode and there's a Miss Piggy segment, which is great.

02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:08.500
And I was howling because Miss Piggy is hilarious.

02:01:08.500 --> 02:01:12.760
But then there was this whole Swedish chef thing where like the joke was old fast.

02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:16.100
And then the RuPaul thing was the joke was also old fast.

02:01:16.100 --> 02:01:20.200
So I really hope the other episodes of Muppets Now are better than the first one or have

02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:22.960
more Miss Piggy, the original drag queen.

02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:23.960
Yeah.

02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:24.960
All right.

02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:31.600
You know, it's funny, I've been also listening to a little bit more historical podcasts and

02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:39.200
talking followed, actually, if you like 60s and 70s drag personalities, it was actually

02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:47.120
kind of cool to learn more of the origins of drag and actually performers from the 1700s

02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:50.080
that Oh, when Lady Bunny started, right?

02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:51.080
Oh, yeah.

02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:52.080
No, no.

02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:54.800
Lady Bunny was well before that.

02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:57.920
Okay.

02:01:57.920 --> 02:01:59.960
She was helping people by their sandals.

02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:00.960
I forgot.

02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:02.520
The Roman government.

02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:04.440
She was she was the entertainment on the Mayflower.

02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:05.440
I forgot.

02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:06.440
Yeah.

02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:07.440
Rob.

02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:08.440
She was the meteor.

02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:12.840
Anyway, Lady Bunny and Lady Bunny is also really fun to chat with.

02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:13.840
I'm just going to throw that out there.

02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:15.840
I love Lady Bunny.

02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:19.520
And if you are not following Lady Bunny on the Facebooks and Twitters, get ready for

02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:21.320
a political ride.

02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:22.720
She is very astute.

02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:30.240
But at any rate, it's a I've been enjoying all this stuff, really getting a little bit

02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:37.240
more in the like, I think learning from techniques now on things because I'm, you know, as a

02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:40.800
sister, I think I can always grow because I mean, that's my drag.

02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:43.320
So that's it.

02:02:43.320 --> 02:02:44.320
All right.

02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:46.680
Well, let's get back to video games.

02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:47.800
Sorry, Loki.

02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:53.560
I know you were really enjoying this discussion, but maybe it was thrilling and I paid attention

02:02:53.560 --> 02:02:55.280
to zero.

02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:59.680
Maybe you have a video game related story to bring us back.

02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:06.400
Oh, by the way, participate at orange lounge radio dot com is the place to send us emails.

02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:11.160
So we can talk a little bit about the about Twitch and how the U.S. Army is coming back

02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:12.160
to it as well.

02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:19.840
May I remember we talked about a few weeks ago how they had been kind of blocked from

02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:27.240
Twitch because of some of the recruiting techniques that they were using, like, for example, posting

02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:33.280
fake giveaways and contests, pages like that, really, to try to get your contact information

02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:36.600
to contact you about your recruitment.

02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:42.880
Plus, they were banning people who were asking questions about different things that weren't

02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:52.520
necessarily abusive or, you know, for example, they were as certain individuals, I guess

02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:58.160
they're asking questions about war or whatnot, and they were being banned from that.

02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:05.480
And since it's a government entity, it's technically illegal for them to be banning folks from

02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:09.560
being able to speak or comment on different things.

02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:14.520
So now, of course, we have a comment from the U.S. Army Esports team, which is resisting

02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:20.760
access for those accounts that previously banned for harassing or degrading behavior.

02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:25.800
The team is reviewing and clarifying its policies and procedures for the stream and provide

02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:29.960
all who have been banned the opportunity to participate in the space as long as they can

02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:31.960
follow the team's guidelines.

02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:38.040
Here, I'm going to give some free advice to the U.S. Army.

02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:39.040
You ready?

02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:42.680
Because I do this with a lot of Twitch channels that have big chat rooms.

02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:44.040
Just don't read the chat.

02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:48.280
Now, you might be thinking, Rob, this is the show where every gamer has a voice and you

02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:49.640
read chat all the time.

02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:52.680
We don't have 5,000 people watching this stream either.

02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:56.840
And if we had that many people watching the stream, I would beg and ugly plead somebody

02:04:56.840 --> 02:04:58.520
to help me screen chat comments.

02:04:58.520 --> 02:04:59.160
Okay.

02:04:59.160 --> 02:05:02.680
Also, if you had 5,000 people in chat, you probably can't read the chat.

02:05:02.680 --> 02:05:03.800
Exactly.

02:05:03.800 --> 02:05:04.600
Just be emojis.

02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:05.080
Yeah.

02:05:05.080 --> 02:05:08.520
So y'all have been very nice and well behaved in the chat room.

02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:12.680
We've only had like a couple incidents and Bobby Banhammer, Black Wolf and the rest of

02:05:12.680 --> 02:05:15.400
our mods met it with swift justice, which is great.

02:05:16.520 --> 02:05:18.680
So y'all know I'm not talking about you.

02:05:18.680 --> 02:05:24.120
I'm talking about those much larger chat rooms where it's just too much.

02:05:24.120 --> 02:05:26.040
And it's impossible to read.

02:05:26.040 --> 02:05:29.000
So I would just encourage the Army, just stop reading chat.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.400
Just stop reading chat.

02:05:31.960 --> 02:05:34.600
If it's gonna hurt your feelings that bad, don't read chat.

02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:36.540
All right.

02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:37.820
Anyhow.

02:05:39.320 --> 02:05:41.480
I guess great that they're back on Twitch.

02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:43.000
I will not be watching.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:43.500
Okay.

02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:45.320
I wasn't before.

02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:47.560
And I just think it's still...

02:05:48.520 --> 02:05:53.080
Just somebody better be watching to make sure that they're not pulling the same garbage

02:05:53.080 --> 02:05:53.400
again.

02:05:53.400 --> 02:05:56.600
Not that there's really going to be any consequences for it, it sounds like.

02:05:56.600 --> 02:05:57.640
So we'll see.

02:05:58.200 --> 02:05:58.520
All right.

02:05:59.080 --> 02:06:05.800
Well, moving on, let's talk about the Nintendo Switch and how it's selling a fucking ton

02:06:05.800 --> 02:06:06.680
of them, basically.

02:06:07.640 --> 02:06:11.560
Some new numbers from Nintendo's first quarter of their financial year.

02:06:11.560 --> 02:06:18.040
So in the three-month window until June 30th, 2020, that'll be what, April 1st to June 30th,

02:06:18.040 --> 02:06:23.880
2020, they sold 5.68 million Switch consoles in just those three months.

02:06:23.880 --> 02:06:28.040
No wonder you couldn't find one when house arrest began and this whole pandemic thing

02:06:28.040 --> 02:06:28.840
going on.

02:06:28.840 --> 02:06:33.560
This means that lifetime sales are at 61.44 million.

02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:39.320
To put that in perspective, it is less than a half million behind the NES.

02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:46.600
The classic 8-bit NES that was in so many households that they now have Lego sets dedicated

02:06:46.600 --> 02:06:47.160
to.

02:06:47.160 --> 02:06:49.560
That is how many Switches are out there.

02:06:49.560 --> 02:06:50.680
So that's a lot.

02:06:51.240 --> 02:06:53.400
Something else to put in mind.

02:06:53.960 --> 02:07:04.200
Animal Crossing New Horizons is now up to a lifetime sales figure of 22.4 million units.

02:07:05.080 --> 02:07:10.840
To put that into perspective, it is the second best-selling game on the Switch, period.

02:07:10.840 --> 02:07:12.120
You know what number one is?

02:07:12.120 --> 02:07:15.400
Anyone want to guess that doesn't know the answer already?

02:07:15.400 --> 02:07:16.520
What's the number one game?

02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:17.640
Darsaka, any thoughts?

02:07:18.600 --> 02:07:19.880
I'll give you a hint.

02:07:19.880 --> 02:07:21.400
It's had more time to sell.

02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:23.560
Oh, Breath of the Wild.

02:07:24.200 --> 02:07:26.120
Very good guess, but that's actually like number five.

02:07:27.400 --> 02:07:29.080
Another good guess, but it's not in there.

02:07:30.520 --> 02:07:33.000
The top-selling game is Mario Kart.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:33.400
You got it.

02:07:33.480 --> 02:07:38.280
It's Mario Kart 8, and it's not that much ahead.

02:07:38.280 --> 02:07:45.560
So it seems almost likely that Animal Crossing will overtake it to become the biggest Nintendo

02:07:45.560 --> 02:07:46.680
Switch game.

02:07:46.680 --> 02:07:49.240
And that is huge for this franchise.

02:07:49.880 --> 02:07:55.640
Animal Crossing is officially bigger than Mario or Zelda.

02:07:56.200 --> 02:07:57.240
Stu on that for a minute.

02:07:58.920 --> 02:08:03.160
Not yet, technically, because Mario Kart is still number one, but probably this time in

02:08:03.160 --> 02:08:07.240
a few months, Animal Crossing is Nintendo's biggest franchise.

02:08:07.240 --> 02:08:08.200
Something to think about.

02:08:09.640 --> 02:08:12.360
Again, certainly the pandemic has probably played into that as well.

02:08:13.640 --> 02:08:18.440
Orangewright says, I'm surprised they haven't made DLC to cash in on Mario Kart 8's deluxe

02:08:18.440 --> 02:08:19.160
success.

02:08:19.160 --> 02:08:23.240
Why would they do that when they're hard at work on Mario Kart 9 if the rumors are to

02:08:23.240 --> 02:08:26.040
be believed or the captain obvious is to be believed?

02:08:26.040 --> 02:08:27.480
Of course, they're going to make a Mario Kart 9.

02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:31.080
Yeah, well, they did DLC already.

02:08:31.080 --> 02:08:32.600
They did two pieces of DLC.

02:08:33.320 --> 02:08:38.760
The only question really is, what's going to be like the twist in Mario Kart 9?

02:08:38.760 --> 02:08:39.720
What are they going to do differently?

02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:42.120
Because Mario Kart 8 will be exactly the same.

02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:43.480
Just more Mario Kart.

02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:44.360
Probably.

02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:46.040
But is that a bad thing?

02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:46.840
I don't think so.

02:08:46.840 --> 02:08:50.760
No, maybe they'll have more characters since Animal Crossing is going to be their number

02:08:50.760 --> 02:08:52.040
one selling franchise.

02:08:52.040 --> 02:08:53.960
They can have Animal Crossing characters in there.

02:08:54.920 --> 02:08:58.040
Which is, Isabel was already in the last one, but yes.

02:08:58.040 --> 02:08:59.880
Well, more Animal Crossing characters.

02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:03.560
Well, yeah, because the Animal Crossing village was the second DLC pack.

02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:05.080
The first pack was the Zelda one.

02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:06.920
The second pack was the Animal Crossing one.

02:09:06.920 --> 02:09:08.200
So something to think about.

02:09:09.960 --> 02:09:15.160
So, yeah, Nintendo also teasing at the announcements that Paper Mario the Origami King had just

02:09:15.160 --> 02:09:15.560
come out.

02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:17.800
They talked about the Pikmin remaster.

02:09:18.360 --> 02:09:22.200
So it looks like Nintendo will probably have another really good quarter this quarter as

02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:28.040
well, especially with this pandemic continuing on and more people are escaping to Animal

02:09:28.040 --> 02:09:30.920
Crossing, which I never even talked about.

02:09:30.920 --> 02:09:33.080
I never even talked about Animal Crossing during my gaming week.

02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:37.560
I'm getting so frustrated that I'm not getting more pictures from villagers.

02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:41.480
I'm giving every single one of them gifts every damn day.

02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:45.560
And I still don't have anybody's picture, but catch up, which she's the most important.

02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:48.600
But still, Rob, what do you want to know what happened?

02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:49.800
What you want to know who left?

02:09:50.840 --> 02:09:51.400
Oh, who?

02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:53.320
Dina.

02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:54.120
Oh, that's sad.

02:09:55.080 --> 02:09:58.600
Well, I mean, and I've got a card to give you of her anyway, so you can have her.

02:09:58.600 --> 02:10:01.160
But but I waited too long to replace her.

02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:06.040
And now I'm getting Graham, who is this derpy looking little hamster.

02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:07.480
And Dan is excited about it.

02:10:07.480 --> 02:10:09.240
But now I need another female character.

02:10:09.240 --> 02:10:13.000
So Octavian is getting the boot because I have his picture.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:16.600
Yeah, I think I told you, I guess this happened last week.

02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:20.920
I lost Joey, the duck that never wore pants like Donald Duck.

02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:25.560
And I got Boots is my newest one, who's like a jock alligator.

02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:27.720
Yeah.

02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:32.360
And the funny thing is, his birth, he showed up on my island like August 2nd.

02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:33.960
His birthday was August 7th.

02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:37.240
So I was like, am I even going to be able to give him a gift?

02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:37.720
Am I going to be?

02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:39.000
But I was able to give him a gift.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.560
If you talked to him for two days, then yeah, you can give him a gift.

02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:42.040
OK, good.

02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:42.520
Yeah.

02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:46.520
So I gave him I gave him one of those iron door things.

02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:47.880
And so he put that out on his house.

02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:51.720
And I even customized it to green because he's an alligator and he's green.

02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:53.000
So I thought he'd like that.

02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:57.240
Well, I'm going to I'm going to probably I don't know.

02:10:57.240 --> 02:10:59.720
Well, you know who I'm going to replace Octavian with?

02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:00.280
His Anka.

02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:05.800
Because I have a card for Anka.

02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:09.480
So and then I will eventually go back on my hunt for Adi.

02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:09.880
We'll see.

02:11:10.840 --> 02:11:12.920
Dark Tetsuya says I'm trying to get Boomer.

02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:15.480
I just had a spot open up, but I haven't found him yet.

02:11:15.480 --> 02:11:16.200
Boomer lives.

02:11:16.200 --> 02:11:17.880
I have Boomer, actually.

02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:20.120
He's my only now since Joey left.

02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:21.720
He's my only lazy type.

02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:24.440
If he ever offers to leave dark Tetsuya, I'll let you know.

02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:27.000
Although it would have to time up just right.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.720
Like he's got to be in boxes the same day you have an empty house.

02:11:29.720 --> 02:11:31.000
So it doesn't always work out.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.400
But I'll let you know if Boomer ever leaves.

02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:39.560
So I am I am never getting rid of of Zucker, who is my lazy special child.

02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:39.880
Yeah.

02:11:39.880 --> 02:11:41.320
Talks to the bugs in his floor.

02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:43.240
I won't let him turn my gown.

02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:44.760
Yeah, I won't like ketchup ever leave.

02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:49.640
Well, Zucker loves his bug, so I gave him a termite now so he can have his bugs 24 seven.

02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:50.440
That's like Boomer.

02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:53.160
He's like obsessed with bugs and taking it easy.

02:11:53.160 --> 02:11:55.400
It's all that you know, it's funny.

02:11:55.400 --> 02:12:00.040
And Dan and I were saying this that even though these are like set personality types,

02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:02.200
they have the same dialog, you know, et cetera.

02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:07.960
It's like looking at their little body types and who they are adds a different

02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:09.480
air of personality to them.

02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:12.760
Like we were talking about how Rosie and Apple.

02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:17.160
OK, Apple's, you know, little squishy hamster, annoying pink thing.

02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:18.360
And Rosie is a cat.

02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:20.120
You know, she's one of the classic ones.

02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:21.000
Everyone knows Rosie.

02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:25.560
But we were like, Rosie's just like Dan's like, yeah, Rosie's kind of full of herself.

02:12:25.560 --> 02:12:27.320
And, you know, she's like the idol girl.

02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:30.840
And while Apple had the same personality, she was so much the wannabe.

02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:31.340
Yeah.

02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:37.080
You know, or like with your characters, like we have Dom and he's a jock, you know, sheep.

02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:38.920
And he's this fluffy little guy.

02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:40.120
Like where's all this muscles?

02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:40.920
He's a fluffy guy.

02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:43.960
So and let me ask this question of D'Artitsio.

02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:45.160
Why not cube?

02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:47.400
If you want a penguin cube still in the game, right?

02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:51.800
He was like, he was the most desirable villager in the original game because it was like cube

02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:53.400
on the GameCube and it's a penguin.

02:12:53.400 --> 02:12:53.900
Cool.

02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:56.040
Although I have a card for cube.

02:12:56.040 --> 02:12:59.960
I'm not one to criticize choices and villagers like, you know, you like who you like.

02:12:59.960 --> 02:13:04.040
So but I'm just I'm I would there's people I will judge for.

02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:08.280
There's ones I will judge for who I want to know.

02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:11.880
I still want Antonio, though, because Antonio is cool.

02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:13.080
Antonio's on Allen's Island.

02:13:16.920 --> 02:13:22.360
But at any rate, there are some that just like really like I'll be honest,

02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:24.520
that pink gorilla one, what was her name?

02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:25.400
Oh, Rocket.

02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:26.280
I liked her.

02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:27.240
I don't like Rocket.

02:13:29.240 --> 02:13:31.000
I honestly don't like any of the gorillas.

02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:32.440
Whatever.

02:13:32.440 --> 02:13:33.000
All right.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:34.440
We should probably move on to the next story.

02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:35.080
Sorry, Jamie.

02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:39.400
We see an Animal Crossing like two hour chat every week.

02:13:40.040 --> 02:13:44.840
New podcast, Animal Crossing all the time or a special live stream on VOG or something.

02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:46.200
Animal Crossing all day, every day.

02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:48.680
Come over to one of our towns.

02:13:48.680 --> 02:13:51.720
Don't tell me I'll do a random Animal Crossing stream on VOG.

02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:53.560
I'll do it if you're willing to join me on Discord.

02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:53.960
Let's do it.

02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:54.680
Let's do it this week.

02:13:54.680 --> 02:13:57.320
We'll talk if it's if it's a day that I can.

02:13:57.320 --> 02:13:57.720
Sure.

02:13:57.720 --> 02:13:58.520
Yeah, we'll talk.

02:13:58.520 --> 02:13:59.000
Yeah.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:00.120
OK, no big whoop.

02:14:01.160 --> 02:14:01.960
No big deal.

02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:03.320
So is it me?

02:14:03.320 --> 02:14:03.820
Yep.

02:14:04.780 --> 02:14:05.340
It's me.

02:14:05.900 --> 02:14:06.940
What do I get to do?

02:14:08.220 --> 02:14:12.140
So, you know, I have been saying I like GamerX to come back.

02:14:12.140 --> 02:14:15.100
I love all the fun, you know, gaming events.

02:14:15.100 --> 02:14:17.580
G-A-Y-M-I-N-G.

02:14:17.580 --> 02:14:22.780
Well, there is a British media outlet called Gaming Magazine that has announced it will

02:14:22.780 --> 02:14:30.940
be holding its first gaming awards ceremony in 2021 that offers recognition to community

02:14:30.940 --> 02:14:35.740
streamers, games, companies that, quote, offer positive and inclusive support in the

02:14:35.740 --> 02:14:38.140
representation of LGBTQ community.

02:14:39.260 --> 02:14:41.020
Don't forget the A. The A is important.

02:14:41.020 --> 02:14:41.580
I am the A.

02:14:42.540 --> 02:14:50.300
And anyway, they have a global panel of over 20 judges in the community who will, you know,

02:14:50.300 --> 02:14:58.700
go through the nominees and go through and offer nominees based on these criteria.

02:14:58.700 --> 02:15:04.220
So we have the Game of the Year category categories, Game of the Year, Authentic Representation

02:15:04.220 --> 02:15:11.180
Award, Best LGBTQ Character, Narrative, Indie Game, Streamer, Industry Diversity Award,

02:15:11.180 --> 02:15:14.380
Special Recognition Award, and Gaming Magazine's Reader Award.

02:15:15.100 --> 02:15:17.180
So, yeah, stay posted.

02:15:17.180 --> 02:15:18.220
Keep a lookout for it.

02:15:18.220 --> 02:15:22.060
And for those in the chat, I'll link the tweet to it.

02:15:22.700 --> 02:15:26.460
So if anyone wants to follow this, there you go.

02:15:26.460 --> 02:15:28.620
But look up Gaming Magazine.

02:15:29.740 --> 02:15:32.220
Their handle is at GamingMag.

02:15:32.220 --> 02:15:34.220
G-A-Y-M-I-N-G-M-A-G.

02:15:35.900 --> 02:15:36.400
All right.

02:15:37.020 --> 02:15:37.260
Yeah.

02:15:37.260 --> 02:15:43.180
I mean, obviously, as a gay guy who plays video games, I'm excited to see something

02:15:43.180 --> 02:15:43.900
like this.

02:15:43.900 --> 02:15:46.380
It does kind of seem like it kind of came out of the blue.

02:15:46.380 --> 02:15:49.740
Like this magazine just decided, hey, let's throw this event.

02:15:49.740 --> 02:15:51.420
And maybe people will show up.

02:15:51.420 --> 02:15:53.500
But I guess that's how all good ideas start, right?

02:15:54.940 --> 02:15:55.820
I think it's a good thing.

02:15:55.820 --> 02:15:57.100
We definitely need more of it.

02:15:57.100 --> 02:15:57.600
Yeah.

02:15:58.380 --> 02:15:59.180
We'll see what happens.

02:16:00.140 --> 02:16:01.420
I'll check it out online.

02:16:01.420 --> 02:16:06.140
I mean, I ain't gonna be able to fly to London, not in February 2021, and check it out in

02:16:06.140 --> 02:16:06.540
person.

02:16:06.540 --> 02:16:09.020
But I'll probably still be banned from the UK then.

02:16:09.020 --> 02:16:10.780
But I'll definitely check it out online.

02:16:10.780 --> 02:16:12.060
So there's that.

02:16:13.020 --> 02:16:13.580
All right.

02:16:13.580 --> 02:16:17.260
A few more stories for you guys before we get to taking your questions in the listener

02:16:17.260 --> 02:16:18.860
roundtable in our chat room.

02:16:18.860 --> 02:16:19.660
Loki, what do you have?

02:16:20.460 --> 02:16:20.960
All right.

02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:30.400
So the World of Warcraft is getting a tribute for one of the Twitch streamers, Reckful.

02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:34.800
So they're going to be honoring him.

02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:37.920
He died apparently last month from suicide.

02:16:37.920 --> 02:16:38.240
Yeah.

02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:45.520
And so with that, they're going to give him a MPC that's going to be located in the Cathedral

02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:47.120
of Light in the Shadowlands.

02:16:47.920 --> 02:16:48.960
So that's pretty cool.

02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:52.160
I like how they do these kind of tributes and stuff for these players.

02:16:53.520 --> 02:16:56.000
So yeah, it's nice.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:04.720
And then apparently if there's, I guess you can, you know, I guess say hi to it and stuff.

02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:11.840
And then basically he'll say, I don't train assassin or assassination rogues.

02:17:11.840 --> 02:17:18.160
I guess it's a reference to his time in the top of the PvP ladder, it says.

02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:19.440
So interesting.

02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:23.920
Yeah, he was trying to prove a point that because assassination was like the big thing

02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:26.080
at the time, it was like one of the strongest builds.

02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:29.040
He was proving that you could do PvP without the assassination build.

02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:32.640
And I think something that was important to remember about Reckful, though, I mean, I

02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:37.440
can't claim to have watched his streams all the time, but my understanding is he was not

02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:41.680
just a popular and large World of Warcraft streamer on Twitch.

02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:44.480
He was an early World of Warcraft streamer on Twitch.

02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:49.040
So one might even argue, like, you know, helped to shape the streaming community on

02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:50.480
Twitch to what it is today.

02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:55.440
So I'm sure there's lots of players who are very happy to hear this and pay tribute.

02:17:55.440 --> 02:18:00.800
And yeah, you've mentioned sometimes folks who have left us in the real world do get

02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:03.280
some sort of memorialization of World of Warcraft.

02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:04.800
I can think of another one off the top of my head.

02:18:04.800 --> 02:18:09.440
I know in a Horde house back in the day when I still had that side podcast about World

02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:15.440
of Warcraft, we talked to somebody whose husband had been memorialized in the Wrath

02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:16.320
of Pandaria.

02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:21.440
No, and there was Mists of Pandaria in the Mists of Pandaria expansion.

02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:24.560
So there was also, like, was it like the Dwarven statue?

02:18:24.560 --> 02:18:25.920
Yeah, there were a few developers.

02:18:25.920 --> 02:18:27.840
There was the Dwarven statue.

02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:31.760
And then there's, you know, people still with us, you know, that have been turned into it

02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:35.200
like Leroy Jenkins is an achievement that I don't think you can get anymore.

02:18:36.400 --> 02:18:37.360
But I got it.

02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:44.080
But, you know, there's so I really that's one thing that I've always given them, even

02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:50.240
if I'm not going to be playing anymore, how they've at least had this bond with the

02:18:50.240 --> 02:18:51.040
community.

02:18:51.040 --> 02:18:55.680
Or as Act Dev says in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, Act Dev says shows us again

02:18:55.680 --> 02:18:58.320
that the actual devs at Blizzard do give a crap.

02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:01.440
So, you know, despite all those other things we were talking about, you know, early in

02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:05.920
the show, which again, that has to do with mismanagement and people at the higher level

02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:09.760
and the Bobby Kotex who are money hungry and all this stuff and and the people that

02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:14.640
are actually in there doing the work on the front lines like are very kind and, you know,

02:19:14.640 --> 02:19:17.360
we'll do these types of things for important community members.

02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:18.400
I think it's really cool.

02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:22.320
Like I, you know, again, I don't like to talk about my own mortality, but I think I've

02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:24.800
even said this, like just a couple weeks ago on the show.

02:19:25.440 --> 02:19:27.760
If anything, heaven forbid should ever happen to me.

02:19:27.760 --> 02:19:34.800
I would I would be so hopeful I would be memorialized as a pokestop or something in these games,

02:19:34.800 --> 02:19:38.080
you know, some of the games that I've loved over the years.

02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:41.600
Final Fantasy 14 would be amazing or Warcraft.

02:19:41.600 --> 02:19:45.200
I loved Warcraft for many years, you know, so anyhow.

02:19:46.320 --> 02:19:46.640
All right.

02:19:46.640 --> 02:19:55.120
Well, moving on to a game that is very old, but in many ways hasn't aged and has really

02:19:55.120 --> 02:20:04.240
shown us many other types of first person shooters since Quake and Quake Con 2020 happened

02:20:04.240 --> 02:20:06.080
this weekend, although, of course, it was all online.

02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:07.440
It was a virtual convention.

02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:13.600
But part of the virtual convention was that you can get the original Quake for free and

02:20:13.600 --> 02:20:16.640
it's something that you can actually play on a newer PC.

02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:18.800
It has to be done through the Bethesda launcher.

02:20:18.800 --> 02:20:22.320
So ain't nothing really free in this world because you got to put that on your computer.

02:20:22.960 --> 02:20:27.600
But it is I actually checked it out myself and downloaded it because I had the Bethesda

02:20:27.600 --> 02:20:28.800
launcher anyway for something else.

02:20:29.520 --> 02:20:32.800
So, yeah, it's it's cool to get to play the OG Quake again.

02:20:32.800 --> 02:20:35.200
I don't know how mod support works or any of that stuff.

02:20:35.200 --> 02:20:40.160
I don't know if it's easy to put in Team Fortress or whatever, but I know it's there.

02:20:40.800 --> 02:20:47.760
And they are saying Quake 2 is supposed to be following very soon now.

02:20:47.760 --> 02:20:49.280
And Quake 3 also.

02:20:49.280 --> 02:20:51.280
Oh, Quake 3 is the best one.

02:20:51.280 --> 02:20:51.760
I hope so.

02:20:51.760 --> 02:20:56.400
Quake 3 is also supposed to be free as well after apparently it says we'll be free in

02:20:56.400 --> 02:21:01.360
Bethesda net launcher after Quake Con if you logged in during Quake Con.

02:21:01.360 --> 02:21:02.640
Now, it's not.

02:21:02.640 --> 02:21:07.520
Yeah, I was just gonna say, because no one special in chat says I just looked at Bethesda's

02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:10.800
launcher store and Quake is a dollar fifty, not free.

02:21:10.800 --> 02:21:14.160
So it might have just run out by the time we were on air.

02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:17.680
So sorry, I guess I should say Quake was free this weekend.

02:21:17.680 --> 02:21:18.400
Womp, womp.

02:21:18.400 --> 02:21:22.720
But do keep a lookout for Quake 2 and 3 because, again, I didn't care for Quake 2 as much,

02:21:22.720 --> 02:21:24.720
but Quake 3 I thought was a really strong game.

02:21:26.480 --> 02:21:29.760
Yeah, and that'll still be through the launcher as well, of course.

02:21:30.480 --> 02:21:31.280
Nice.

02:21:31.280 --> 02:21:33.520
Oh, yeah, they got their $10,000 donations.

02:21:33.520 --> 02:21:34.000
That's cool.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:34.500
Great.

02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:35.680
All right.

02:21:35.680 --> 02:21:38.800
Well, that is it for the topics that we had planned out tonight.

02:21:38.800 --> 02:21:42.080
But if you have something you want to bring up, you can do that in our chat room over

02:21:42.080 --> 02:21:44.080
twitch.tv slash vog network.

02:21:44.080 --> 02:21:47.040
Maybe there's something we haven't discussed tonight or you want to get our opinion on

02:21:47.040 --> 02:21:48.160
that we haven't talked about yet.

02:21:48.720 --> 02:21:51.600
In the meantime, I will turn to Loki and see if there's any last minute stories.

02:21:52.800 --> 02:21:57.280
No, because you took my one in the very beginning about the controllers leaking.

02:21:57.280 --> 02:21:57.920
Oh, my bad.

02:21:58.640 --> 02:22:01.920
Aside from that, there is absolutely nothing else to talk about.

02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:04.880
Yeah, I have to be honest.

02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:07.680
I had to really dig to fill out the show tonight.

02:22:07.680 --> 02:22:08.800
I think we had a bunch of...

02:22:08.800 --> 02:22:11.600
They were all good stories, but it was just enough.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:17.520
But if we're wrong, if you guys have an additional thing you want to talk about, please, by all

02:22:17.520 --> 02:22:18.640
means, speak up and chat.

02:22:18.640 --> 02:22:21.280
We do have a chat from no one special in our chat.

02:22:21.280 --> 02:22:22.640
It says round table question.

02:22:23.200 --> 02:22:24.800
Okay, so most of us...

02:22:24.800 --> 02:22:27.280
And by the way, for the podcast listeners who aren't here live,

02:22:27.280 --> 02:22:30.960
the name in chat really is no one special 77.

02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:34.080
I'm not being like, oh, they're nobody special.

02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:36.160
That's actually their nickname, just so we're clear.

02:22:36.160 --> 02:22:37.760
I'm not a total asshole, just partial.

02:22:38.400 --> 02:22:40.320
No one special asks round table question.

02:22:40.320 --> 02:22:46.000
Okay, so most of us, if not all of us, love retro games and retro collections, and they're

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.160
semi-popular on services like Steam.

02:22:48.880 --> 02:22:55.200
That being said, if you could have any game from the 1990s re-released for Steam, what

02:22:55.200 --> 02:22:56.880
would it be and why?

02:22:57.600 --> 02:23:03.040
Ooh, see, now it's the 90s, so I can't go to my go-to guardian legend answer from 1988

02:23:03.040 --> 02:23:04.880
or 87, whenever that was out.

02:23:04.880 --> 02:23:06.560
So what do we do from the 90s, gang?

02:23:07.120 --> 02:23:09.360
What game would you like to see re-released from Steam?

02:23:13.360 --> 02:23:14.320
Virtua racing.

02:23:17.920 --> 02:23:19.040
When did Rival Schools come out?

02:23:19.040 --> 02:23:27.360
Um, I might say, you know, uh, and I talk about this game frequently as an old favorite

02:23:27.360 --> 02:23:28.640
on the 1997.

02:23:28.640 --> 02:23:29.200
It counts.

02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:29.600
Okay.

02:23:30.480 --> 02:23:33.760
On the NES and Super Nintendo, there was a series.

02:23:33.760 --> 02:23:38.480
There was a, it was a Solstice on the NES and it was Equinox on the Super Nintendo.

02:23:38.480 --> 02:23:40.000
And I think a lot of people knew Solstice.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:45.520
I don't think hardly anybody knew Equinox, but it was that rare Sony Imagine Soft game

02:23:45.520 --> 02:23:48.400
on the Super Nintendo, because this is before Sony had their own thing.

02:23:49.280 --> 02:23:50.800
And I loved Equinox.

02:23:50.800 --> 02:23:51.680
I love the music.

02:23:51.680 --> 02:23:53.680
I love the type of game it was.

02:23:53.680 --> 02:23:57.840
And there's games that I guess that are kind of like it, but I would love to have like

02:23:57.840 --> 02:24:05.680
an official release of those type of games, uh, kind of come back on, um, um, Steam.

02:24:06.400 --> 02:24:11.760
Um, or I guess if I could, if you wanted to go way back to PC stuff, I mean, think about

02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:15.120
some of the games I've talked about as classic game of the week previously on the show.

02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:18.960
And you probably got to go way back, but there was a game I used to love to play in

02:24:18.960 --> 02:24:22.000
the nineties, uh, that was over a modem.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:23.680
It was called Lexi Cross.

02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:27.280
And I know I've done this as a classic game of the week, but it was like a game show that

02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:28.560
was like a word puzzle.

02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:32.400
It was like a wheel of fortune mixed with like a crossword puzzle type of thing.

02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:36.240
Uh, and you could play over the modem and actually play against somebody else.

02:24:36.240 --> 02:24:37.840
I thought that game was tons of fun.

02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:38.640
So I love that.

02:24:39.520 --> 02:24:44.160
So, um, I would say, uh, point blank.

02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:47.200
Oh, that's a good one.

02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:54.960
You know, our buddy Y Y R released a really good point blank inspired game called sharpshooter

02:24:54.960 --> 02:24:56.240
available on Steam.

02:24:56.240 --> 02:24:57.280
Cheap plug, cheap plug.

02:24:58.160 --> 02:24:58.800
So there's that.

02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:00.160
Yeah.

02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:03.600
I see that there was a point blank DS game, which I completely forgot about.

02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:05.120
I forgot about that too.

02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:10.160
Um, a thing, but yeah, I would like to see a new point blank would be pretty cool.

02:25:10.160 --> 02:25:10.960
Yeah.

02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:15.520
Uh, let's see pixel pockets and chat says freelance writers for the popular visual novel

02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:16.080
collection.

02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:20.480
Love struck one, a significant pay increase from their publisher voltage.

02:25:20.480 --> 02:25:25.200
They had a strike for 21 days because they were being paid under market rates.

02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:29.840
See what I tell you earlier in the show, this is, this is the beginning, like this bubble

02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:35.120
on the whole, like unions and, and folks that, you know, again, and I, as I said earlier

02:25:35.120 --> 02:25:38.560
in the show, folks that are taken advantage of because.

02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:44.640
Higher ups know that there's so many people that are enthusiastic and wanting to get into

02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:45.440
the industry.

02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:50.160
Like the bubble's going to burst on that very soon because honestly you have so many people

02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:53.600
now that are just like, you know what, if this is the way I'm going to get treated,

02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:54.000
fuck it.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:55.120
I'm going to make an indie game.

02:25:55.120 --> 02:25:56.960
I'm going to make my own game studio.

02:25:56.960 --> 02:26:02.640
I'm going to make the next fall guys and be, you know, a huge, successful success.

02:26:03.440 --> 02:26:08.160
So apparently doing a quick Google search for point blank, apparently gun bullet X is

02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:13.440
a thing, which is a brand new point blank game that came out in 2017 arcades and it's

02:26:13.440 --> 02:26:14.560
all in HD and stuff.

02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:17.280
So I guess we already got that.

02:26:17.280 --> 02:26:21.200
I'd still like it on steam, but you know, at least it's a thing.

02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:26.880
Dr. Tzuyu in chat says it's not nineties, but I wish Capcom would release their early

02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:29.520
eighties arcade stuff on steam and switch.

02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:32.960
They had a pretty decent arcade collection on the PlayStation three.

02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:34.320
It was in like five parts.

02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:39.520
And I don't know why they haven't gone back to that because, you know, Sega goes back

02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:40.400
to that.

02:26:40.400 --> 02:26:45.360
Every generation there's some fucking Genesis collection that'll come out, you know, that

02:26:45.360 --> 02:26:46.640
was something new or whatever.

02:26:47.440 --> 02:26:50.720
And some of the, like the Sega ages stuff is pretty great.

02:26:50.720 --> 02:26:53.680
I wish they would compile all of those on a one disc and release that.

02:26:54.320 --> 02:26:56.800
And speaking of Capcom, how about Powerstone?

02:26:56.800 --> 02:26:58.400
Can we get some more Powerstone please?

02:26:58.400 --> 02:26:58.800
Yes.

02:26:58.800 --> 02:26:59.520
Good call.

02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:00.720
Powerstone.

02:27:00.720 --> 02:27:02.240
I'm all for that on the switch.

02:27:02.240 --> 02:27:03.440
Let's bring that back.

02:27:03.440 --> 02:27:03.920
Yep.

02:27:03.920 --> 02:27:05.440
I think that's one we can all agree on.

02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:06.960
So that's the answer to your question.

02:27:06.960 --> 02:27:12.320
Now with Capcom and Eidos, can we get, you know, Capcom's not willing to get Eidos to

02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:12.880
do it.

02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:13.120
All right.

02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:14.240
There's the official answer.

02:27:14.240 --> 02:27:16.960
There's the official OLR approved answer to your question.

02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:17.760
No one special.

02:27:17.760 --> 02:27:19.200
The game we want to see is Powerstone.

02:27:21.040 --> 02:27:21.680
All right.

02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:21.920
Yeah.

02:27:21.920 --> 02:27:25.440
Orange Wright says that's one of the few reasons I turn on my Vita is Powerstone collection.

02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:26.880
Yes, that's true.

02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:27.600
They have that there.

02:27:28.320 --> 02:27:29.440
There's on the via TV.

02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:35.200
I really, I really wish PlayStation five would do something with my Vita library.

02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:40.480
I know it's asking for a lot, but man, I would be so happy if I could just like play my digital

02:27:40.480 --> 02:27:42.800
Vita purchase games on my PlayStation five.

02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:45.040
Like I know, I know I'm reaching.

02:27:45.040 --> 02:27:48.320
I know it's a big ask, but how awesome would that be?

02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:53.840
They should be able to emulate it with the power of the PlayStation five.

02:27:53.840 --> 02:27:54.640
I mean, come on.

02:27:55.680 --> 02:28:00.320
I get angry when I think, because like the best version of Final Fantasy four is on the

02:28:00.480 --> 02:28:03.040
Vita or actually was on the PSP, but also Vita.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:08.960
And then Powerstone collection and luminous and active says, I want Tyco.

02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:11.600
Like, yeah, my God.

02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:14.080
That's what I want.

02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:15.360
Sony help.

02:28:15.360 --> 02:28:15.860
All right.

02:28:17.040 --> 02:28:19.600
That's going to do it for another episode of orange lounge radio.

02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:23.200
Then we're going to start to wrap things up here by getting everybody's final thoughts.

02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:25.840
But first I want to thank you guys for tuning into our show tonight.

02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:29.840
So of course we do tape live Sunday nights at the voice geeks network,

02:28:29.920 --> 02:28:32.080
starting at about six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern.

02:28:32.720 --> 02:28:35.920
And if, uh, you know, we don't ask for your money or anything like that.

02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:39.200
We were, we appreciate the bits and love the followers and all that.

02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:41.040
And I really, really appreciate all that stuff.

02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:44.560
And so I want to say thank you for that, but you know what really, really helps the show

02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:45.520
is word of mouth.

02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:48.560
So if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio, tell a friend or two about the

02:28:48.560 --> 02:28:51.120
show, um, that word of mouth goes an awful long way.

02:28:51.120 --> 02:28:54.640
The hosting is awesome too on Twitch, if you're willing to do that.

02:28:54.640 --> 02:28:58.880
But even if you just show up every week, we're happy to have you and, uh, really appreciate

02:28:58.880 --> 02:28:59.600
that as well.

02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:04.560
A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Google play, wherever it is.

02:29:04.560 --> 02:29:07.920
Although I heard podcasting is going away and Google play and moving somewhere else.

02:29:07.920 --> 02:29:11.920
So wherever it is you found this show, uh, appreciate that type of word of mouth too.

02:29:12.480 --> 02:29:13.040
Uh, all right.

02:29:13.040 --> 02:29:16.000
With that, let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:17.600
So Loki, we'll start with you tonight.

02:29:17.600 --> 02:29:18.240
Your final thought.

02:29:18.880 --> 02:29:22.000
I'm hopefully going to build some more Legos on stream.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:25.520
Um, I don't know at some point we'll get around to it, I guess.

02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:27.760
Um, I'd like to do that.

02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:32.880
Uh, my final thought is definitely want to play no man's sky this week.

02:29:32.880 --> 02:29:36.800
I'm, I'm feeling invigorated having helped delve in out through those first few stages

02:29:36.800 --> 02:29:38.800
and someday we'll play multiplayer.

02:29:38.800 --> 02:29:42.960
Uh, I've got a stream animal crossing this week now with dark soccer, cause I'm really

02:29:42.960 --> 02:29:44.160
into this idea.

02:29:44.160 --> 02:29:48.240
And, uh, and only one other person sent me their code for a dream Island, but we'll go

02:29:48.240 --> 02:29:49.840
visit it if nothing else.

02:29:49.840 --> 02:29:54.560
And, uh, number three, there's a final fantasy 14 patch finally after a long wait this week.

02:29:54.560 --> 02:29:56.720
And I'm very, very excited to play that as well.

02:29:56.800 --> 02:29:59.920
Cause it's the conclusion to this latest expansion story.

02:29:59.920 --> 02:30:01.760
So I'm really excited to explore that.

02:30:01.760 --> 02:30:08.000
And they are finally taking the chop to the realm reborn content.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:12.480
So if you thought your biggest problem with fantasy 14 was it takes too fucking long to

02:30:12.480 --> 02:30:13.920
get through realm reborn.

02:30:13.920 --> 02:30:14.400
Good news.

02:30:14.400 --> 02:30:16.240
They're cutting it way down this next expansion.

02:30:16.240 --> 02:30:17.200
That's a great thing.

02:30:17.200 --> 02:30:18.160
Or I'm sorry, this next patch.

02:30:18.160 --> 02:30:19.040
That's a great thing.

02:30:19.040 --> 02:30:21.200
Uh, last but not least dark soccer, your final thought.

02:30:22.080 --> 02:30:26.800
So I decided to go ahead and look up the character, um, uh, stuff for shadow lands.

02:30:27.440 --> 02:30:30.080
And one of the undead literally has the Elvira hair.

02:30:32.240 --> 02:30:33.360
That's awesome.

02:30:33.360 --> 02:30:34.240
It's the best thing.

02:30:34.240 --> 02:30:34.800
Yeah.

02:30:34.800 --> 02:30:39.280
Um, but no, another thing is just make sure everybody makes sure you are registered to

02:30:39.280 --> 02:30:39.840
vote.

02:30:39.840 --> 02:30:44.560
Make sure you get everything that you need to vote by mail and then vote accordingly.

02:30:45.760 --> 02:30:48.880
Or be prepared to drop off your ballot in person.

02:30:48.880 --> 02:30:49.120
Yeah.

02:30:49.120 --> 02:30:51.760
And vote early because, you know, mail will be slow.

02:30:52.480 --> 02:30:53.280
Exactly.

02:30:53.280 --> 02:30:55.760
Do do the thing, make change happen.

02:30:55.760 --> 02:30:55.920
Yeah.

02:30:56.800 --> 02:31:00.320
I would really think as long as you're, you know, if you're immunocompromised, this still

02:31:00.320 --> 02:31:03.600
might be a risk for you, but if you're willing to like put on a mask and just generally stay

02:31:03.600 --> 02:31:09.040
away from people, drop off your ballot in person, that's the best way to do it.

02:31:09.040 --> 02:31:12.240
I'm going to spend every episode, like the end of drag race.

02:31:15.200 --> 02:31:17.360
Are you going to dance around with the sign that says registered to vote?

02:31:17.360 --> 02:31:18.720
No, I'm not going to do that.

02:31:18.880 --> 02:31:19.200
Okay.

02:31:20.240 --> 02:31:20.480
All right.

02:31:20.480 --> 02:31:22.480
I'm also sending you the old my right here.

02:31:22.480 --> 02:31:23.200
All right.

02:31:23.200 --> 02:31:27.680
That is going to do it for my first hands-free episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:31:28.320 --> 02:31:32.400
Thank you so much for listening to the show tonight and checking out our show.

02:31:33.280 --> 02:31:37.520
We will be back again to do it all in seven days or another week and who knows what type

02:31:37.520 --> 02:31:37.760
of news.

02:31:37.760 --> 02:31:40.080
Maybe we'll get another surprise Nintendo announcement.

02:31:40.080 --> 02:31:41.680
We can dream, right?

02:31:41.680 --> 02:31:42.480
We'll see.

02:31:42.480 --> 02:31:43.920
Until then, have a great week, everybody.

02:31:46.560 --> 02:31:48.640
No, all you have to do is climb that hill.

02:31:49.280 --> 02:31:50.720
And make a deal with God.

02:31:50.720 --> 02:31:51.200
All right.

02:31:51.200 --> 02:31:51.760
That's it.

02:31:51.760 --> 02:31:52.320
We're out of here.

02:31:52.320 --> 02:31:53.440
That's running up that hill.

02:31:53.440 --> 02:31:53.680
Okay.

02:31:54.240 --> 02:31:54.740
Bye.
