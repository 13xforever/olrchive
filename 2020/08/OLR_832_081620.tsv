0	13640	I have fond memories of seeing SNK MVS cabinets in arcades, reading the cards for the list
13640	16360	of games and then jamming the switch game button to see if it's accurate.
16360	20520	Unico's MVSX classic system tickles my fancy in a way that modded cabinets never did, with
20520	24760	all the benefits of an LCD instead of a CRT and the optional stand speaks to its dramatically
24760	26900	increased portability due to weight alone.
26900	30380	This is just my opinion, but I know that your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki
30380	34260	also lived in the era of SNK proliferation, and they'll opine about this too, starting
34260	36740	right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
36740	45140	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
45140	47260	where every gamer has a voice.
47260	53980	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back again live tonight with episode number 832
53980	58140	of our show for this August the 16th of 2020.
58140	62260	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me tonight is Techmaster Loki.
62260	63260	Hello.
63260	66480	Hi Loki, how are you doing?
66480	67480	I'm doing good.
67480	68480	Awesome.
68480	72700	Not joining us tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers, she has the night off, but her presence
72700	75940	in the show lives on through that awesome new theme song.
75940	79900	If you haven't heard OLR in a while, we changed some things up a few months ago.
79900	82700	So that great new theme song by DarkSakura.
82700	84740	She'll be back next week with us live.
84740	90660	But I am joined by Techmaster Loki and all those of you in our chat over at twitch.tv
90660	95860	slash vog network or the voice geeks network, VOG network, because we do tape live every
95860	99700	Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf
99700	102520	show at twitch.tv slash vog network.
102520	103520	I just said it.
103520	105540	Anyhow, how are you doing, Loki?
105540	107100	You had a good week?
107100	110980	Yeah, it's been all right.
110980	113480	It is extremely hot this weekend.
113480	116860	I think a lot of the country is going through this, especially the West Coast.
116860	120300	But I'm here where the show is based in Sacramento, California.
120300	123860	I believe the temperature today was one hundred and nine.
123860	125620	It was more probably more than that.
125620	128060	I was like one hundred and twelve in the shade in my car.
128060	129060	Oh, my God.
129060	131380	Lisa's what said.
131380	136500	And then we had a had a guest appearance apparently in Northern California of a fire tornado.
136500	137500	So that was a thing.
137500	138500	Oh, yeah.
138500	139500	Twenty twenty.
139500	140500	What else is twenty twenty got for us?
141020	144500	We're already having to do this show over discord thanks to that whole pandemic that's
144500	146500	going on that you might have heard of.
146500	147700	And now we have fire tornadoes.
147700	148700	Lovely.
148700	149700	Yeah.
149700	151540	The weather was really crazy today because it was actually raining.
151540	156180	Like we have cloud cover and it was raining, but it is still over one hundred degrees outside.
156180	159780	And I'm like, this is not like usually when the clouds come in and the rain start, that
159780	161260	means you're going to get a lower temperature.
161260	163020	So it's it's weird.
163020	166660	And you know, I'm not I'm not going to say I know everything about meteorology.
166660	171340	Obviously, these types of things happen, but it's just I'm not used to it living here.
171340	172980	So, yeah, we're in a crazy heat wave right now.
172980	179500	I almost chose to do tonight's show with the light off and just sit in the dark and apologize
179500	180500	to the people.
180500	183340	We can do an are you afraid of the dark episode?
183340	184340	Right.
184340	186900	I oh, I could have done the episode by candlelight.
186900	191380	I wish I thought these things beforehand, but the truth is the light is all the way
191380	192380	over there.
192380	193380	It's an LED light.
193380	196340	So it doesn't really do a lot of heat, give off a lot of heat.
196340	198820	Honestly, a candle probably would have given off more heat.
198820	201060	So it's probably OK this way.
201060	204340	It's just, you know, trying to conserve all the electricity because they're really kind
204340	206180	of stressing to us here in California.
206180	211660	You got to conserve electricity because some areas are having rolling blackouts.
211660	215180	We have a government utility that runs things here in Sacramento.
215180	217600	There's a Sacramento municipal utility.
217600	224420	So I'm not as worried about shutoffs and things because they never have problems, but they
224420	226340	have their shit together.
226340	231140	Like you could say what you want about the government, but I've never had problems with
231140	232660	the energy company here.
232660	237500	So I'll actually be sad if I ever move out of city limits and have to go back to a different
237500	238500	company.
238500	244300	So is that we just need a government run Internet company as well so we can get that reliable,
244300	248820	fast Internet for less money than it would cost the third parties.
248820	250580	Some day, some day.
250580	255180	Bobby Blackwell in chat says, fun fact, I recorded my whole show on a camcorder just
255180	256740	off screen for reasons.
256740	260580	I have a feeling I might know what those reasons might be.
260580	262340	And I can't really tell you what they are.
262340	265880	But hey, in a related thing, maybe.
265880	269140	Did you know that Dragon Con is going virtual this year?
269140	271120	There's going to be a virtual Dragon Con event.
271120	276360	So you can actually participate from home and watch different channels that will have
276360	277720	different types of events.
277720	281860	And the good news is, is that the digital media track, which is one of the tracks that
281860	287060	I've worked with in the past, is going to be doing kind of their own like panel schedule
287060	290680	thing like they would do during the convention, except it's going to be all virtual and it's
290680	292300	going to be on Twitch.
292300	295760	And I'm going to be on three of the panels over the weekend.
295760	300000	So there and actually one of them is during OLR.
300000	303400	So in in the gray, that's going to be some multitasking you're doing there.
303400	307740	Well, I figured in the great tradition of the past seven years since we've never done
307740	311300	a show Labor Day weekend anyway, why should this year be any different?
311300	313940	So we'll probably just not do a show that night.
313940	314940	And I don't know.
314940	318720	I don't know if Bobby's doing a show that night after all or what, but I already kind
318720	322620	of told him we probably won't just because I'm doing a panel that starts at six o'clock
322620	323620	Pacific.
323620	324620	So, oops.
324620	328180	Well, hopefully they advertise it more than Comic-Con did, because, you know, that did
328180	329180	the same.
329180	330780	They have the same thing with their tracks and everything.
330780	335160	And I didn't know it was even a thing until, like, I think probably was over.
335160	340680	Well, you better believe I'll be blowing shit up on Twitter, pimping on my schedule.
340680	344480	I was hoping there might be something with the video game track, too, but I wasn't reached
344480	346400	out to, which is OK, because I know everything.
346400	348920	I'm not saying like, oh, they should be calling me.
348920	351960	No, everything is crazy this year because it's virtual and they've probably had to come
351960	356160	up with some plan, you know, and I totally understand and I can't wait to see everybody
356160	360260	in person again in 2021, hopefully.
360260	366180	But, you know, I am going to be doing the stuff with the digital media track and I'm
366180	367400	excited about that.
367400	371920	And I was reached out to by another track, too, that I've never worked with before and
371920	373720	I really wanted to do it.
373720	377160	But I don't want to say what it was because I don't want to I don't want to sound disrespectful
377160	380800	or anything, because the reality was I didn't know anything about the subject they wanted
380800	383320	me to do.
383320	387480	But it doesn't have to do a gaming, it doesn't have to do a broadcasting.
387480	391020	Think really hard for those of you that listen to orange entree over the years.
391020	394420	There's some other things that I do on the weekend and I haven't done them this year
394420	395580	because of covid.
395580	396580	But think really hard.
396580	400820	You might be able to piece it together and but they were really cool about it.
400820	404640	They were like, oh, thank you for being honest, because, you know, I'm sure there's a lot
404640	406780	of people that are like, oh, sure, I'll just fake it.
406780	408220	I'll fake it and do a good job.
408220	411380	And we don't want to watch that panel where the person is faking it.
411380	415740	So out of respect to the panel, I said I wasn't going to do it.
415740	420680	So all right, S.S.U. 100 Matt in chat says the food track.
420680	422160	I knew it.
422160	423960	I wish there was a food track.
423960	426120	That would be awesome.
426120	428280	I don't think there is a food track now.
428280	429720	There should be a food track.
429720	434920	I mean, there are food trucks that are parked near the convention and they certainly have.
434920	438740	Actually, I will say over the over the seven, eight years, I've literally lost count.
438740	441840	I think this would have been year eight had I gone.
441840	442980	I guess I am going.
442980	444440	I'm going digitally, whatever.
444440	448440	So out of the eight years I've been going to Dragon Con, the first couple of years,
448440	452800	I don't remember them having food so accessible in the hotels.
452800	454800	But the hotels really wised up.
454800	459020	They got vendors like Papa John's, which say what you will about their pizza.
459020	462820	But when it's drunk and they're close by, you really don't care.
462820	464620	You know, they're there within the hotels.
464620	467740	My absolute favorite thing in the world, this would be the last Dragon Con thing I say and
467740	469420	then we can get into video game news.
469420	474760	My absolute favorite thing in the world is the alcohol ice cream.
474760	477640	So they actually sell ice cream that has alcohol in it.
477640	479360	And it's it's outstanding.
479360	481660	And I'm sure Bobby will shout the name of the vendor because I can't remember it off
481660	482760	top my head.
482760	486020	But they started showing up two years ago and they've been there.
486020	487740	And I think it's it's brilliant.
487740	488900	And I love their ice cream.
488900	491060	And it's a great thing to kind of just take down with you.
491060	492540	And I'm just eating ice cream.
492540	493540	Everybody teehee.
493540	495540	Oh, Bobby can't remember their name in the moment either.
495540	497540	Well, that's OK.
497540	499300	This Ben to Dragon Con will know what I'm talking about.
499300	501780	But yeah, stay tuned for Dragon Con.
501780	504780	Speaking of events going virtual, I want to make sure a plug goes out for this and then
504780	506380	we'll get into tonight's kickoff topic.
506380	510580	So Loki, I'll have you take care of the kickoff topic here in a moment.
510580	514040	But Summer Games Done Quick just kicked off today.
514040	518040	And I know a lot of you guys watched that event as well as the awesome Games Done Quick
518040	520280	event in January.
520280	521280	Awesome event.
521280	522940	It's not just a clever name for charity.
522940	526220	They raise a lot of money doing a lot of speed runs.
526220	529420	And usually we're kind of sitting here just kind of like going, oh, what a great event.
529420	530420	We watch it.
530420	531420	We're fans.
531420	532420	We partake.
532420	533420	We might donate if we're able to and so forth.
533420	538100	But very little do we actually get involved.
538100	540700	Last year, our voiceover guy, Jason, got involved.
540700	541820	I think it was last year.
541820	545020	Sorry, Jason, if I'm I'm cutting that short, it might have been two years ago.
545020	551080	But last year, Jason got involved being doing things on site with the Games Done Quick event.
551080	552080	And that was really cool to hear about.
552080	556120	And I think he came on the show at one point and was talking to us a little bit about that.
556120	561800	This year, VOG Network's own Bobby Blackwolf on Before Us here at the VoiceGeeks Network
561800	567240	is actually going to be one of the hosts, is what they call them, announcers, voiceover
567240	575080	folks, while the speed run for Devil May Cry 4 is going on on Wednesday night at 11 o'clock
575080	577080	Eastern, 8 Pacific.
577080	578080	I hope I got that right.
578080	580560	Don't be mad if I'm not.
580560	585080	Bobby Blackwolf is actually going to be the guy that reads donations now and again when
585080	588460	the speed runners ask him to do so.
588460	591000	My understanding is this is a pretty tight speed run.
591000	594840	There's probably not going to be a lot, a lot of donations and so forth that are able
594840	595840	to be read.
595840	599240	But I think it's really cool that Bobby's getting that opportunity to like jump in there
599240	600240	and be in there.
600240	605600	So I know I plan to watch just to support Bobby, but also to support the awesome charity
605600	610140	and the speed runners that really make this event possible.
610140	616100	And if you do decide to donate, make sure your donation isn't about VOG Network or Bobby.
616100	618740	We can dish about that over here on Sunday night when it's over.
618740	621760	Make sure your donations about the speed runner or about the charity.
621760	623700	If you want, you can do like host choice.
623700	627980	That's a nice little way to let Bobby have a little bit of power if you want.
627980	631320	But yeah, don't spam chat with VOG Network.
631320	632320	That's silly.
632320	633920	Don't do that stuff, please.
633920	638420	Please make it about the charity, which is Doctors Without Borders if you hadn't heard.
638420	643980	And what a time to do that, because, you know, even though it's looking like we will have
643980	649300	a vaccine of some sort in 2021, fingers crossed, toast crossed, et cetera, the news is looking
649300	650860	very good there, right?
650860	656180	The reality is, even though our country, the U.S., will get the vaccine, Canada will get
656180	659580	the vaccine, UK, I'm sure, will get the vaccine and so on and so on.
659580	662900	Many industrialized nations around the world will get the vaccine.
662900	666580	COVID is still going to be a thing on our planet because there's going to be a lot of
666580	673340	nations that aren't going to be able to get that vaccine for their people as fast.
673340	678120	But an organization like Doctors Without Borders can help treat sick people and so forth in
678120	679120	these countries.
679120	682100	And I mean, they were on the front lines and things like Ebola and SARS and things are
682100	683100	happening too.
683100	687180	So it's a great charity to support because the reality is and all the experts have said
687180	690100	this COVID-19 is not going away.
690100	692500	We're not going to eradicate it from the planet.
692540	697620	Hopefully, fingers, toast crossed, we eradicate it from our nation like Ebola, right?
697620	700260	We don't hear about that anymore, but Ebola is still a thing.
700260	703900	You hear about a breakout now and then in some country and so forth, and that may be
703900	705940	the story for COVID-19.
705940	714620	So anyway, Bobby actually says this is the first year that Doctors Without Borders operated
714620	716100	in the U.S.
716100	718540	They were in New York a few months ago.
718540	722100	So during when New York was the epicenter of the COVID thing.
722260	724700	Bobby also says the time is likely to change.
724700	729260	It was originally 10 p.m. Eastern, but now it's like 1130 Eastern.
729260	733620	And that just happens as you know, I think they had a little tech kick up this morning
733620	737460	and I'm sure some speed runs run longer, shorter, whatever happens there.
737460	738780	So times are fluid.
738780	741500	That's why my brain was going, I'm not sure this is right.
741500	743020	Yeah, because I was hearing a couple of times.
743020	744020	That's why.
744020	745020	All right.
745020	746020	Just check the website.
746020	747020	Look at the schedule there.
747020	748020	Oh, yeah.
748020	749020	Yeah, that's a good way to stay on top of it.
749020	752860	I'm sure Bobby's going to send out a tweet or something.
752860	760660	And also our Discord is a great place to be over at vognetwork.com, vognetwork.com slash
760660	761660	Discord.
761660	762980	We'll get you into our Discord server.
762980	764860	That's a great place to be as well.
764860	771980	And if you want, I'm pretty sure we'll do this as well as while Bobby is actually doing
771980	775340	the games done quick, we'll probably host it.
775340	776580	I haven't talked to him about this.
776580	782960	I don't know if this is a faux pas, but we'll probably host it so that our chat can say
782960	787820	whatever we want about, yay, Bobby and all that stuff in our chat, the VOG network chat.
787820	790820	But I don't know if that might be frowned on because maybe Summer Games wants the viewers.
790820	791820	I don't know.
791820	794860	But as long as they're, as long as y'all are donating that, okay, Bobby says, yes, I was
794860	795860	going to host it.
795860	796860	Phew.
796860	797860	Okay.
797860	799660	So we'll host it on the VOG network channel when he's going.
799660	800660	So that'll be great.
800660	801660	Okay.
801660	802660	Cool.
802660	803660	And they like hosts.
803660	804660	Yay.
804660	805660	Because it is about the charity at the end of the day.
805740	807340	So let's get into some news.
807340	810860	There's some big news that happened this week.
810860	811860	And this is a big one.
811860	817780	A lot of people on social media are watching because I think we on social media are being
817780	819700	recruited for this effort.
819700	820700	Aren't we, Loki?
820700	821700	What's going on?
821700	827980	Well, of course, because they have to get all the kiddies to, you know, blindly advocate
827980	828980	for them.
829300	839420	billionaire company, Epic Games, had made some updates to Fortnite's client in iOS and
839420	841300	Android.
841300	846100	And they added a direct payment option that was cheaper on those devices.
846100	853500	So what they basically did is surpassed the normally required processes through their
853500	859020	respective app stores where both Apple and Google take a cut of that.
859020	861620	That's how they make their money.
861620	866660	And so Epic complained about it before and whined about it.
866660	869500	And I think even if I remember correctly, like at one point, they're like, well, we're
869500	874300	not even going to put it on the Androids or the Google Play Store because we don't like
874300	875300	that.
875300	880380	So they had their own separate launcher and then it was kind of a pain to get it installed
880380	884660	on your device or like paying for your target audience.
884660	889260	I believe throughout all this separate launcher is still there.
889260	896740	Yeah, so now they of course, they were integrated into those stores.
896740	902220	And so now they added this direct pay option, which definitely goes against the, you know,
902220	904380	rules to be on those storefronts.
904380	910460	And so immediately, as they probably expected, because they definitely planned all this,
910460	917180	they were booted off of the Epic Games Store, or I'm sorry, off of the iOS store and also
917180	919100	the Google Play Store.
919100	926900	And then of course, they put out this ridiculous parody video of like one of the old Apple
926900	935780	commercials talk, you know, basically calling, you know, Apple, this very, this controlling
935780	940060	entity for their store, which be honest, it's their storefront, they can do whatever they
940060	941060	want.
941060	942060	They can make the rules.
942060	946260	I don't necessarily like that there's an open option, whereas on Android, if you don't want
946260	951660	to use the Google Play Store, there's other options, but it's not necessarily as preferable.
951660	955020	And there's stuff you have to do to sideload all that.
955020	956020	Two things.
956140	962940	One, the commercial was a direct parody of a 1984 style commercial that Apple did way
962940	963940	back in the day.
963940	966580	I don't know if it was Olympics or Super Bowl or something like that, but it was an ad that
966580	971100	they did to try to kind of announce that, you know, Apple was coming and it was coming
971100	974300	for the dominant IBM machines at the time.
974300	978740	Although I seem to recall Commodore 64 was still a thing in 84 and all this other stuff.
978740	984260	So my history is a little blurry there, but I know it is a direct parody of an Apple Macintosh
984300	985540	commercial, like shot for shot.
985540	989620	Like Bobby had a whole side by side on his show that went, I didn't realize how close
989620	992800	to the original it really was until he played that shot for shot.
992800	999740	But number two, I must admit, I expected you to come out guns a blazing on Epic's side
999740	1001040	with this.
1001040	1002040	But you definitely-
1002040	1005460	Oh, I'm not going to take the side of a billionaire company, I'm sorry.
1005460	1009660	I'm just a little, I'm a little surprised, but I'm pleasantly surprised.
1009660	1014980	Why should they get, why should they get an exception to the rule when all the other
1014980	1017540	smaller developers have to pay that same fee?
1017540	1018540	I'm sorry.
1018540	1021440	No big company don't get special treatment.
1021440	1024380	So you know, I think it's stupid.
1024380	1029280	But anyways, they're of course filing a lawsuit against those two companies, which is already
1029280	1030280	drawn up.
1030280	1032140	So obviously all this was already planned out.
1032140	1035140	And of course at the same time, they also have a hashtag that they want you to go on
1035140	1041260	social media and complain to Apple and Google that, oh, we need to go our launcher away.
1041260	1044740	I mean, it's absolutely ridiculous.
1044740	1046860	First off, please don't do that.
1046860	1051180	I mean, I would respect our listeners enough to know that they're smart enough to know
1051180	1054380	not to advocate for corporations.
1054380	1060620	You don't need to advocate for a company that is literally, they're literally fighting over
1060620	1065180	money when they make billions and billions and billions of dollars, and they will continue
1065180	1068860	to make billions and billions and billions of dollars after all this is done too.
1068860	1072180	Please do not feel the need to advocate for them.
1072180	1073180	They are big boys.
1073180	1074540	They can handle themselves.
1074540	1081940	So it's just ridiculous to try to throw some bad press away just to try to get their way.
1081940	1082940	What's Epic doing?
1082940	1083940	They're not playing fair either.
1083940	1087180	I mean, they're the ones they're paying for exclusives and stuff on their platform to
1087180	1089180	try to get people to go to the Epic game store.
1089180	1092420	Yeah, they're offering a discount for developers that go on there.
1092420	1093420	That's great.
1093420	1094420	If you want to take that, cool.
1094420	1096380	But they're also not playing fair with other things.
1096380	1103980	So it's ridiculous to think that they're like some white knight of the gaming industry.
1103980	1104980	They're not.
1104980	1108800	And I just think this whole thing is ridiculous.
1108800	1112140	I'm a little stunned because I find I pretty much agree with Loki and I don't have a lot
1112140	1113140	to add.
1113140	1116900	This is a pleasant change.
1116900	1119700	I mean, I know y'all like the debate and you tune in for that.
1119700	1123040	But yeah, that I here's the thing.
1123040	1126820	I don't consider that I'm like completely against Epic in this situation.
1126820	1133700	I do understand some of the concerns, but don't think for a minute that Epic isn't trying
1133700	1138700	to weaponize social media for their own purposes.
1138700	1141220	And I think that is shady shade.
1141220	1147940	That is, it's really, and it's transparent as fuck because they had that commercial ready
1147940	1149220	to go.
1149220	1152340	They strong arm this move ready to go.
1152340	1155700	They had that legal paperwork ready to go.
1155700	1157940	This was a calculated plan.
1157940	1158940	For what?
1158940	1159940	I'm going to tell you what.
1159940	1161940	You know what else is ready to go?
1161940	1164620	The Epic game store on iOS.
1164620	1171060	Mark my words, timestamp this episode because if Epic wins this legal thing and Apple has
1171060	1176240	to allow like other competing stores or whatever on because it's part of, it's part of, it's
1176240	1181300	not as much in the big thing, but they do reference it like the having the game store
1181300	1182300	or whatever.
1182300	1186340	If this whole, if the courts end up signing with Epic, Epic will have their own game store
1186340	1189300	up on iOS the next day.
1189300	1190300	Why?
1190300	1192980	Because they want to undercut Apple.
1192980	1196860	And anything, and also, and even if you, and I understand there's people that are very,
1196860	1197960	very pro Apple.
1197960	1203120	There's people that are very, very anti Apple, but anything I'm saying Apple in this case
1203120	1204940	also applies to Google.
1204940	1208680	They are one in this, in this case, they are one in the same.
1208680	1211400	There are other things about those stores that are very much, not the same like the
1211400	1215520	cloud gaming, but with this, this particular Fortnite case, it's really the same thing
1215520	1217760	on both sides.
1217760	1224440	So if, if the courts end up siding with Epic the next day, the Epic game store is going
1224440	1225760	to be available on iOS.
1225760	1228200	The Epic game store is going to be available on Google play.
1228200	1231480	And the Epic game store is going to immediately undercut that 30% fee.
1231480	1233200	That's going to be the very first thing that they do.
1233200	1234200	Okay, fine.
1234200	1236680	I understand competition's good, but you know what Epic's going to do?
1236680	1238600	They can go ahead and do that already though.
1238600	1242800	They can literally build their own storefront on Android and just put it out there.
1242800	1246840	Granted, you have to sideload it into your device, but they could literally do that.
1246840	1251560	That, I mean, look at the, um, you know, they have the Amazon storefront for awhile, the
1251560	1256800	Amazon app store and not as popular, but I mean, it's definitely, it's a thing that
1256800	1257800	they could do.
1257800	1259800	I, I don't understand.
1259800	1261160	They could already go ahead and do that.
1261160	1266840	It's just, they want to have like their launcher available on the Google play store and they
1266840	1268240	also want to not pay the fee.
1268240	1269240	I'm sorry.
1269240	1271200	You can't be on a store.
1271200	1275000	You have to play by the rules, you know, in order to be on their storefront.
1275000	1276560	That's just the way it is.
1276560	1280920	And so if you don't play by the rules and you can't be on there, I'm telling you, this
1280920	1283560	is what's going to happen next after that.
1283560	1288120	Because what is the other big thing in Epic's pocket right now is that they, they run a
1288120	1292640	massively popular engine to write video games in.
1292640	1299680	So how easy is it going to be for them to, in their own game publishing system, one touch
1299680	1303060	published to the Epic game store on mobile devices.
1303060	1307880	And now that game is available in their game store, but there'll be some type of exclusivity
1307880	1311880	agreement or whatever the financial situation, whatever's going to be better.
1311880	1315260	Who's who's now, who's got the dominating part of the market.
1315260	1317280	Now who's trying to control it.
1317280	1319060	And I'm telling you, this is Epic's big plan.
1319060	1321640	I am telling you, this is what they want.
1321640	1324260	And I don't even have to sit in the boardroom to know this.
1324260	1331400	So I can understand why people want to needle Apple and Google on the way some of their
1331400	1333240	stores are locked down.
1333240	1338320	And especially like the cloud gaming thing, which I do think Google and Apple are going
1338320	1342720	to need to, well, Google already has, I'm sorry, Apple needs to relent on the cloud
1342720	1343840	gaming thing a little bit.
1343840	1348680	They're going to need to treat the cloud gaming like Netflix, like Spotify, like Twitch.
1348680	1352040	They don't, they don't moderate all of the content here.
1352040	1356600	If you're watching on your iOS device, this stream right now, Apple didn't review it.
1356600	1357600	You know what I mean?
1357600	1359520	And I think they're going to have to take that same approach with games.
1360120	1364100	So I'm not saying like, oh gosh, the stores are perfect in this particular scenario, but
1364100	1371660	I do not see this as Epic fighting for the consumer, fighting for the little guy, fighting
1371660	1373880	for a freer store.
1373880	1380280	Epic wants a freer market that they can take advantage of, period.
1380280	1381280	That's what they do.
1381280	1382280	Right, exactly.
1382280	1386560	Just like, just like all of the stuff that they did in, you know, to make things better
1386560	1390000	against Steam really hasn't really done anything.
1390000	1395920	All it's done is some games are now free on Epic store once a month and, and some games
1395920	1398080	are only exclusively through the Epic store.
1398080	1401400	And I now have to use two different launchers to play some games.
1401400	1406760	Like I don't notice like it, they didn't change the industry.
1406760	1407760	Sorry.
1407760	1410240	You're not big enough to do that.
1410240	1412280	You throw your money around and it's your exclusives.
1412280	1415360	That doesn't, that's not because people wanted to come to your storefront, it's because you
1415360	1416360	paid for it.
1416360	1421420	And it's whatever, let, let them fight.
1421420	1427260	I also feel that if Epic wants to be more competitive, maybe they should like fix their
1427260	1429120	own damn store first.
1429120	1432320	Like cause their store is still an inferior product on PC.
1432320	1433320	Sorry.
1433320	1434920	I said it, said it.
1434920	1440160	And that's my opinion, but, and I use the Epic game store, hell yeah, I cash in on those
1440160	1445400	free games, but the Epic game store is the only place that I've been hacked.
1445440	1447320	That didn't happen to me on Steam.
1447320	1449640	The Epic game store still doesn't have achievements.
1449640	1454440	The Epic game store is still missing the ability to pay with preloaded cards.
1454440	1459840	You know, there's still a lot of places where the Epic game store is really lagging behind.
1459840	1463360	So there's a part of me that's like, why don't you use your resources to fix your own damn
1463360	1465140	house first?
1465140	1467720	Then you can, you know, kind of take on this other stuff.
1467720	1471760	I don't know, but, and I want to be clear because I don't want to completely sound like
1471760	1477080	I'm like a hundred percent pro the Apple and Google side of things.
1477080	1482800	Because I do think Apple especially is, and I'm an Apple user, look, look, if you're on
1482800	1485960	the Twitch feed right now, what do I have in my, I have Apple earbuds in my phone right
1485960	1486960	now.
1486960	1487960	Okay.
1487960	1488960	There's a lot of Apple products I love.
1488960	1491880	But I do think they're going a bit far with like the cloud gaming stuff.
1491880	1496760	Like I said before, like if all this other stuff exists, why shouldn't video games be
1496760	1498660	able to be streamed through the cloud and so forth?
1498660	1504700	And I do think there needs to be a better kind of line drawn with, you know what, if
1504700	1508620	you sell a product directly on your site, then whatever.
1508620	1511660	But if you're selling it through the store, then yes, we get to have a cut.
1511660	1517820	And my examples would be Spotify, Netflix, CBS, all of those things, you can go buy on
1517820	1520220	the website.
1520220	1523420	And I think, especially with Twitch, I think is a great example too, you can buy them on
1523420	1527820	the website or you can buy them through the app, but you know what Twitch doesn't do?
1528700	1531620	And they're more expensive if you buy them in the app, of course, because you know, they're
1531620	1535700	having to pay for Apple's cut and they're passing that cost on to you.
1535700	1539780	But what they don't do is they don't have a big old pop up that comes up and says, you
1539780	1544620	can get these bits cheaper if you go directly to our website by clicking here and going
1544620	1545620	to do that.
1545620	1549480	And I do kind of see where there's probably going to have to be a line drawn there where
1549480	1556500	there can't be like a click here to be instantly taken out of the store and go around that
1556500	1557780	30% fee.
1557780	1560820	I think it's going to have to be one of those things where, OK, if you do it on the website,
1560820	1561820	then whatever.
1561820	1565820	But if you do it from within the store, something from the store, then it's got to have that
1565820	1566980	30% fee.
1566980	1569700	And I would be OK with that, quite honestly.
1569700	1572620	Like I think that's what Epic should be happy with as well.
1572620	1577140	Like if they sell the thing on their own storefront, then whatever.
1577140	1579380	And that's because you brought the purchase to them.
1579380	1580500	I don't know.
1580500	1586440	And I don't see them trying to burn the bridges with Microsoft and Sony as well, or even in
1586440	1589560	Nintendo with their storefronts, because they all take a cut as well.
1589560	1594480	I'm sure that's where the majority of their gamers are, that and PC.
1594480	1601040	So, of course, these being a smaller market share on Android and iOS devices.
1601040	1602680	That's probably why they're risking it there.
1602680	1606440	But they sure as heck aren't going to do it at the other places because that would just
1606440	1607440	destroy them.
1607440	1612280	SSJ 100 Matt says, it's an ugly pinch fight between billionaires.
1612280	1614680	We're the losers because we have to watch it.
1615200	1618960	I don't know what a win looks like in this scenario.
1618960	1623240	You know, again, if Epic comes out victorious in this whole thing, I'm not sure the confetti
1623240	1627520	cannons should be readied, because what is that really going to mean?
1627520	1632920	I just, you know, I'm pretty sure they're not the first company to sue Apple because
1632920	1636000	they don't have an open storefront to allow other.
1636000	1639840	I'm almost positive Spotify or Amazon has an Amazon sued them.
1639840	1643320	I'm pretty sure maybe that was over the term app store.
1643320	1650920	But I'm pretty sure that there's other companies that have sued them to try to get this opened
1650920	1656280	up for other companies to have their own individual storefronts, but doesn't seem to have worked
1656280	1657280	so far.
1657280	1661720	I mean, I don't know if they think it's sure throw money at the problem, I guess, but Questbuster
1661720	1667040	in chat says, as a side note, last year, Spotify filed an antitrust complaint against Apple,
1667040	1670020	which is now part of the EU's ongoing investigation.
1670020	1673660	They also mentioned the 30% cut, which they call attacks.
1673660	1675660	There is that.
1675660	1677720	I want to read a couple other comments here.
1677720	1678720	This is important too.
1678720	1683900	VG Realness in chat says, fuck Apple, fuck Google, and fuck Epic.
1683900	1686440	I'm thinking of that scene.
1686440	1689760	And sorry, it's going to be a Drag Race reference, Loki, but I'm thinking that scene from Untucked
1689760	1694300	in season 12, where Heidi Ann Closet gets up and goes, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you,
1694300	1695300	and fuck you.
1695300	1697600	That's what VG Realness is doing right now.
1697600	1700320	Fuck Apple, fuck Google, and fuck Epic.
1700320	1701320	Rich.
1701320	1702320	Yeah.
1702320	1706080	Was that like, I can't remember which movie it was like, fuck you, fuck you.
1706080	1707800	You're cool.
1707800	1712120	I think that was, I think that was this movie about waiters waiting or something like that.
1712120	1714760	Anyway, I need to read the rest of the comment is very important.
1714760	1715760	I need to read it.
1715760	1718500	And VG Realness says, fuck Apple, fuck Google, fuck Epic.
1718500	1723320	Rich companies whining and complaining to be more rich, making us fight their battles.
1723320	1726800	Meanwhile, the cops who killed Breonna Taylor are still free.
1726840	1729940	My point, there are bigger issues in life at the moment.
1729940	1732460	Absolutely a hundred percent true.
1732460	1738040	It is disgusting that there have been no charges brought up against the cops who murdered Breonna
1738040	1739600	Taylor.
1739600	1748360	However, games sometimes, I think we can still separate that games and gaming and video games
1748360	1753000	also kind of exist to give us an escape of all these shitty things that are going on
1753000	1754360	in the real world.
1754360	1758640	That doesn't mean to ignore it, to be ignorant of it or forget it.
1758640	1764400	But for example, I know with this whole COVID-19 and in quarantine and being isolated, staying
1764400	1769360	at home and all this stuff, you know, I've been battling quarantine related depression
1769360	1774060	things and video games are a really good escape from all that.
1774060	1780680	At the end of the day, I can also see the point where it's like, fuck all of these companies.
1780680	1782440	They're all in it for themselves.
1782440	1783440	They win.
1783440	1784440	News.
1784440	1786360	What the fuck ever happens, happens.
1786360	1791040	I totally get that perspective and it's honestly kind of like where my head is at.
1791040	1797060	However, I think it is kind of worth looking at what is that going to look like if Epic
1797060	1801440	wins this and now the Epic Game Store is something that's available on iOS.
1801440	1803300	Is that something that interests you?
1803300	1806740	And my answer is hell no, because the Epic Game Store doesn't really interest me on the
1806740	1811320	PC right now outside of the free games and all the fucking exclusives that they get,
1811320	1814840	which kind of forced me to buy certain things on their store, which I really don't like
1814840	1815960	doing.
1815960	1819160	I've bought one game on their store and it's Tetris Effect.
1819160	1823580	So anyway, let's see.
1823580	1828080	Run John Stomp, excuse me, in chat says, I don't care what happens to Fortnite.
1828080	1833000	I just want Epic Games to push Apple to change some rules because that means cloud gaming
1833000	1835680	has a better chance of happening on my iPad.
1835680	1839860	And again, I'm with you where I think that's the rule that needs to change.
1839860	1844220	But my gut kind of tells me it will, because it did for Netflix.
1844220	1845920	It did for Spotify.
1845920	1849300	It did for that email app that was recently in the news.
1849300	1850300	What was it?
1850300	1852940	Hey, you're someone I'm sorry, I forget the name, but some some email app went to battle
1852940	1854400	with Apple on that, too.
1854400	1856600	And I think ultimately, that's where this ends up, too.
1856600	1861220	I think the cloud gaming apps will happen on iOS.
1861220	1862700	Am I being stupidly optimistic?
1862700	1863700	Maybe.
1863700	1866100	But I just kind of think the track record is there.
1866100	1870060	But I do think the storefront and who gets the 30% cut and so forth will end up being
1870060	1872060	a different issue.
1872060	1875940	Let's see.
1875940	1877280	Let's see.
1877280	1882580	Bobby Black Wolf says, I platinumed Persona 5 Royal after 124 hours to battle quarantine
1882580	1883580	depression.
1883580	1886640	Note, I do not actually have medical depression, which is a real thing.
1886640	1888380	I'm just depressed as an emotion.
1888380	1889420	Yeah, same.
1889420	1891380	I'm not saying I was diagnosed or anything like that.
1891380	1892380	I'm not here to belittle.
1892380	1893700	You all know what I mean.
1894420	1899420	We've all got the feels during these events and so forth and video games can be a great
1899420	1900820	escape for that.
1900820	1904900	But again, don't be ignorant to everything else going on in the world.
1904900	1905900	Y'all better be.
1905900	1908540	Y'all better be figuring out how you're going to vote in the US.
1908540	1911820	Y'all better figure out how you can be voting in November, because it sounds like they're
1911820	1914060	going to try to make it as difficult as possible.
1914060	1918460	So I'd care a little bit more if they said, oh, hey, we're just trying to earn some additional
1918460	1923260	money so we can donate that all to the US Postal Service to keep that thing afloat.
1923260	1926220	But yeah, it's just going in their pockets.
1926220	1928340	Well fucking said, to be honest.
1928340	1929340	All right.
1929340	1930340	Yes.
1930340	1934060	If Epic said, you know what, we're doing this because we want to donate the extra money
1934060	1938380	to the US Postal Service, I think this we would be having a completely different discussion
1938380	1939380	right now.
1939380	1940380	But they're not.
1940380	1944940	They're going to be having discussions like you can't get changed just by, you know, pissing
1944940	1947360	somebody off and then filing a lawsuit about it.
1947360	1952020	You need to like just partner with these guys and like have a discussion about what you
1952020	1954200	want to do.
1954200	1956060	Maybe they've tried that and it hasn't gone their way.
1956060	1962780	But like, I don't think at the end of this, I mean, like with on the Google side of things,
1962780	1969580	because we've been focusing a lot on Apple, but like, I don't know, not that I'm saying
1969580	1977500	that it would be advantageous for them to, for Epic to try to get say Fortnite on, I
1977500	1979580	don't know, Stadia.
1979580	1985340	But like if that was something that they were thinking about doing, I think that kind of
1985340	1987860	burned their bridge there with that.
1987860	1988860	I don't know.
1988860	1994820	It's just, it seems kind of silly that this may not work out for them.
1994820	1996060	It might not.
1996060	1999220	And I think one other thing I want to make sure we say before we get into our gaming
1999220	2003180	weeks on this whole topic, because I can't totally speak for Loki, but I have an idea.
2003180	2008540	This is where his head is at on this as well, is that if it sounds like we're really irritated
2008540	2014380	with Epic in this whole situation, like it's not necessarily the fact that they're pushing
2014380	2018180	back on Apple's rules because people are always doing it.
2018180	2021820	Like I said, and when it comes to the cloud gaming issues, Spotify has done it, Netflix
2021820	2026120	has done it, or cloud based services issue, Netflix has done it, et cetera, et cetera.
2026120	2030360	Like it's not the fact that they're making a legal issue out of it or whatever.
2030360	2044400	It's the fucking propaganda and how they're trying to weaponize gamers, which are not
2044400	2049160	usually the most pleasant crowd on social media to begin with.
2049160	2054280	And I think gamers on social media, and I'm not talking about the vast majority of people
2054280	2058400	that listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because you guys have been really cool in your comments,
2058400	2066560	but I think y'all know when you go into very large gaming chat rooms and you watch events
2066560	2072300	and you see things on social media, you see a lot of negativity, you see a lot of anger,
2072300	2074360	you see a lot of bullshit.
2074360	2080700	And I think that's what's really irritating about this is that Epic is trying to weaponize
2080700	2083760	that bullshit.
2083760	2088940	And that's the part where I'm just like, this is so transparent.
2088940	2092940	I'm like, I'm offended almost, almost.
2092940	2099180	So would be, I mean, not, not the judge people, but I would assume like a lot of the Fortnite
2099180	2102640	players out there are probably younger.
2102640	2106200	Do they, do they know what 1984 is?
2106200	2107920	Do they even know who George Orwell is?
2107920	2109880	Are they still forced to read that in high school?
2109880	2110880	I don't know.
2111880	2118320	Cause I can't imagine like, you know, when you're asking them on retaliation of, you
2118320	2121640	know, was Epic Games to defy the App Store monopoly.
2121640	2123880	Okay, dude, come on.
2123880	2129680	And is this going to fight the top 20, 20 from becoming 1984, dude, if they were talking
2129680	2135620	about like, you know, Facebook and you know, all these other like social media platforms
2135620	2140280	tracking your, your movements and stuff like that, I might be more on board.
2140280	2145760	But like, because you can't get a few extra percentage points out of, you know, your App
2145760	2146760	Store purchases.
2146760	2147760	I'm sorry.
2147760	2151120	That's not quite the same.
2151120	2153400	Oh, Big Brother.
2153400	2154520	I love that show.
2154520	2162960	Stan Janelle, SSJ100 Matt says, ask the people dealing with crunch time working on Fortnite
2162960	2165080	how much this matters to them.
2165080	2166080	Yeah.
2166080	2167080	Yeah.
2167080	2170280	How many, how many crunch hours did it take to put up that trailer?
2173280	2174280	That's it.
2174280	2175280	That's it.
2175280	2176280	Just, just like that.
2176280	2177760	Just leave that and leave the room.
2177760	2178760	That's all you need.
2178760	2180000	That's, that was fucking great.
2180000	2181000	All right.
2181000	2184920	Uh, let's, let's get into other gaming news and talk.
2184920	2188880	We'll see where this goes, but since it's legal, it's not going to go anywhere fast.
2188880	2189880	That's for sure.
2189880	2190880	So we'll move on.
2190880	2194360	Let's talk about other things like how was our gaming week and what are the types of
2194360	2196280	video games that we have been playing this week?
2196480	2198440	Ricky, how was your gaming week?
2198440	2203200	So, um, I played a few things this week, so I played a whole ton of Orna because I took
2203200	2208060	a road trip down to the Bay area this week, um, to go visit my grandparents.
2208060	2213840	So, uh, I wasn't driving the car this time, so I got to try to capture all of the territories
2213840	2217840	between here and Santa Clara.
2217840	2219680	Um, so it was great.
2219680	2225960	I like a few hundred, uh, probably like 150 to 200 new explored territories, um, because
2225960	2229880	Orna unlike, you know, like Pokemon Go and Ingress and stuff will let you play quite
2229880	2231360	a bit when the car is moving.
2231360	2233360	So it's, it worked out great.
2233360	2240880	Uh, so I did that and then, um, I played a little bit, uh, my kids actually made me play
2240880	2246840	a bit of, um, Paper Mario and the Origami King cause I had to do boss fights and stuff.
2246840	2250760	So I got to play against the second boss, which is great.
2250760	2252960	And um, what else?
2252960	2255080	I think I played a little bit of Minecraft this week.
2255080	2260440	Um, I've been doing like kind of game dev tutorials, um, most of the week.
2260440	2261440	That's what I've been working on.
2261440	2266680	Uh, so a little, a little different than the usual stuff I've been messing with.
2266680	2272160	I, um, took up some new programs and stuff to learn those, but yeah, that's pretty much
2272160	2273160	it.
2273160	2274160	All right.
2274560	2275560	My gaming week.
2275560	2279160	So I've been playing a lot of the same old stables, um, still playing Final Fantasy
2279160	2282520	14, a brand new content patch was released this week.
2282520	2288120	The big, uh, update we've been waiting for 5.3 just came out that actually kind of bookends
2288120	2290780	the Shadowbringers expansion story.
2290780	2295120	This patch was delayed a little bit because of COVID, um, I guess Square in Japan had
2295120	2298040	some difficulty with transitioning to the work at home thing.
2298040	2300240	Um, it just set them behind schedule a little bit.
2300240	2302080	So this patch has been a long time coming.
2302120	2304840	Uh, but it showed up this week and it's, it's really good.
2304840	2309800	Like from a story perspective, it's really, really good and really cements the Shadowbringers
2309800	2315440	story and really all of the Final Fantasy 14 expansions as just one of the best JRPG
2315440	2317000	stories that's out there right now.
2317000	2320480	Now of course there's that whole problem about the monthly fee and I understand that's what
2320480	2322080	turns people off to it.
2322080	2327200	The good news is though, for what it's worth, um, this patch did also make the free to play
2327200	2329720	experience a lot more robust.
2329760	2334800	You can now play the first two, and there's four all together Final Fantasy 14 expansions,
2334800	2336680	you can play the first two for free.
2336680	2340280	They let you go all the way to level 60 and basically everything with Heaven's Word you
2340280	2341460	can do for free.
2341460	2345960	Now you can't really join free companies, you can't do things that they're worried about
2345960	2350880	guild sellers, explore, um, gold sellers, whatever, exploiting free accounts.
2350880	2354240	There's still, a lot of that is still shut off and so, you know, obviously the other
2354240	2357920	day they want to make money, uh, but there's still an awful lot you can do for free.
2357960	2363840	However, I'm hearing that like, if you played A Realm Were Born and then you stopped, I'm
2363840	2367800	hearing some of those people are having a real hard time coming back for the free to
2367800	2368800	play thing.
2368800	2373480	I don't know all the ins and outs of how that works, or what have you, I'm just hearing
2373480	2375920	it's a little bit headachy.
2375920	2380040	But for people that have not played 14 at all, there is that opportunity and Heaven's
2380040	2383820	Word was a great story, so I think it's pretty cool.
2383820	2388300	But yeah, I really enjoyed the latest patch, obviously I'm not going to spoil anything,
2388300	2392700	but I thought it really wrapped everything up very nicely, it was very movie-like and
2392700	2394020	very well done.
2394020	2399460	So um, yeah, kudos to the Final Fantasy 14 team, they're continuing to develop a phenomenal
2399460	2401220	game, that's for sure.
2401220	2406140	Other games I've been playing this week, still the same old GPS stuff, like Pokemon Go, I
2406140	2412180	have done so much remote raiding in Pokemon Go, I'm almost embarrassed to say how many
2412180	2417420	of those stupid coins I've spent on remote raid passes, well, it's not a crazy amount,
2417420	2423020	but it's a few, trying to get like a shiny Genesect, and I still don't have one.
2423020	2428500	I did like another five fights today, I get a lot of like random invites, I'm very lucky,
2428500	2432460	and I've been taking them up on some of them, like if I see them pop up in time, I'll try
2432460	2437500	to join in, and if I have the pass, I'll join in and do the remote raid, but I love what
2437500	2439560	remote raiding's done to the game.
2439560	2445280	This made it a lot easier to get a group together to do a fight, and I hope it stays long past
2445280	2448400	this COVID thing, and I think it's going to, I think they're going to cap how many people
2448400	2452000	can do it, but you should still be able to get a minimal group together to take down
2452000	2456160	any raid boss with those remote raid passes, and I think that's going to be a really good
2456160	2457160	thing.
2457160	2459040	So, very cool.
2459040	2464960	Sorry, I'm backtracking a little bit, but this is very important, Bobby in chat says,
2464960	2478680	See, that's, that's dumb on Square's part, and World of Warcraft doesn't do that, theirs
2478680	2486120	is a little bit stronger in that regard, so, I would say the two things holding Final Fantasy
2486120	2492120	XIV back right now, their archaic storefront, and this is an example of that, and their
2492120	2497000	archaic server structure, which WoW is ahead of them in that regard.
2497000	2501040	Those are the two, like, negative things I'll say about Final Fantasy XIV that I really
2501040	2502800	would like to see them work on.
2502800	2506880	Love the game, love the product, they really need to work on those two things.
2506880	2512580	The dumb storefront, and the dumb server structure that doesn't make me, doesn't let me play
2512580	2516280	with my friends in the US because they picked it at different data center.
2516280	2518760	Like we're past that, WoW has shown that.
2518760	2524080	SHG100Matt says, Rob sent me a raid invite last night, it was close to midnight here
2524080	2526920	on the east coast, so yeah, remote raid is great.
2526920	2530880	Yeah, you can do the, I got a raid invite in Germany today, that I was doing at like
2530880	2533040	10am, so that was kind of fun.
2533040	2538200	And it's neat because if you catch the Pokemon it shows, well actually no, my geotags disappeared
2538200	2543120	but it used to show, like this Genesect is from Germany or whatever, so it's kind of
2543120	2547040	fun catching them all from around the world thanks to remote passes.
2547040	2551320	The other game I've been playing this week, Fall Guys, which you know, it's free on
2551320	2555600	PlayStation Plus, free with gold, and it's also available on Steam.
2555600	2560820	Alan has really gotten into Fall Guys on Steam, and I played a little bit on PlayStation 4,
2560820	2564540	and I think it's great because it's that whole battle royale thing but it's not a
2564540	2565540	shooty shooty bang bang.
2565540	2569560	Oh yeah, that was the other thing, I forgot I played Fall Guys this week as well, that
2569560	2571360	was something I played quite a bit of as well.
2571360	2572360	Oh yeah?
2572360	2574020	What do you think of Fall Guys?
2574020	2577580	It's alright, sometimes it can be a little bit frustrating with the controls, but overall
2577580	2579620	it's been pretty decent.
2579620	2583900	I just wish the controls are a little bit tighter so that it's not so much like I'm
2583900	2588900	falling over, I mean I get it, Fall Guys ha, but like I wish it wasn't that I was falling
2588900	2595060	over all the time, you know, more skill based, like I can actually be able to run this stuff
2595060	2600540	a little bit easier, but I mean it is what it is, it's fine.
2600540	2601540	It's pretty fun.
2602060	2604780	Anyway, I don't want to duplicate myself too much because I'm pretty sure I talked about
2604780	2608700	this game last week because I remember saying this game when it comes out on the Switch
2608700	2613380	is going to be the game, and I think that's just a matter of time when that happens and
2613380	2617900	I still stand by that, but Fall Guys is fun for sure, so.
2617900	2622340	No One Special 77 in chat says, seems like every Tom, Dick, and Harry plus their long
2622340	2627460	dead granny, that's quite a mouthful, is streaming Fall Guys on Twitch, from what I've seen it
2627460	2630020	looks like Mario-less party.
2630020	2633780	Well, Fall Guys also, if I'm not mistaken, they did a kind of campaign with some of the
2633780	2639780	big streamers on Twitch to kind of bump themselves up in the rankings, but a lot of games do
2639780	2643280	that and not all of them catch on, this one caught on.
2643280	2648020	And I think it's just part of, I like the fact, you can play it in short, quick little
2648020	2652760	matches, short little bursts, you can play it with friends, and I think it makes it an
2652760	2657180	attractive game to stream, probably because it's very easy to understand what's going
2657180	2658180	on.
2658180	2663660	I don't always like to watch narrative streams being streamed on Twitch, and I stream a lot
2663660	2668020	less of them myself, I'm not gonna say I'm never gonna do it, but I would probably always
2668020	2671180	stream the beginning of it, I probably wouldn't stream midway, because I don't like to jump
2671180	2674920	into a game like watching somebody do Paper Mario, I have a lot of friends that are streaming
2674920	2678580	Paper Mario, I don't want to see the game halfway through, because A, it's kind of like
2678580	2682500	spoiling part of the story, B, all the mechanics have already been explained and sometimes
2682500	2686620	it's hard to understand what's going on, Fall Guys, it's very easy to understand what's
2686620	2687940	going on.
2687940	2694060	And I think that's what makes it really lucrative to stream, for sure.
2694060	2698220	Pele Hanumea in chat says, I got my pineapple costume in Fall Guys, so I'm good.
2698220	2702380	Yeah, some of the costumes are really funny, so I need to play more to get costumes.
2702380	2706180	Alan, have you got any costumes in Fall Guys?
2706180	2710580	I'm waiting to see what he says from the other room.
2710580	2714060	He says as you play, you level up, even if you don't win.
2714060	2718000	As you play, you level up, even if you don't win, and you just unlock stuff.
2718000	2721260	So have you unlocked anything cool?
2721260	2724860	He says, he's thinking, I got like a dinosaur.
2724860	2727780	A dinosaur, okay, that's cool.
2727780	2731900	Act Def says, there's an Enter the Gungeon costume right now on PlayStation 4.
2731900	2732900	Nice.
2732900	2740180	Yeah, and they're also doing a Team Fortress 2 skin as well, so I think the Scout.
2740180	2741180	I think you're right.
2741300	2745860	Anyway, that was pretty much it for my gaming week, so had fun there.
2745860	2748260	I want to go out and do Orna and all that stuff too.
2748260	2749260	It's too hot.
2749260	2753440	I haven't played Ingress in the past two days just because of the weather.
2753440	2757940	It's too much, and I'm at the point where I'm like, if the other team is going to field
2757940	2762020	right now, I can't be bothered.
2762020	2767060	They want it more if they're going to play in this heat, because it is insane right now.
2767060	2768500	And that's kind of where I'm at with Pokemon Go.
2768500	2774220	They did the Pokemon Go Community Day Makeup, or sorry, Pokemon Go Fest Makeup was today.
2774220	2776180	I didn't go outside for that, hell no.
2776180	2782780	But I did Incense on the couch, and I didn't catch anything that spectacular, but I tried.
2782780	2784780	But I wasn't going to go outside and play.
2784780	2786260	It's too hot.
2786260	2787260	It's still hot.
2787260	2792220	My watch says it is still 105 degrees outside, and it's not even 7 o'clock.
2792220	2794820	This is Phoenix-style weather going on right here.
2794820	2797180	All right, anyhow, let's move on.
2797180	2799960	Let's get into some news, some other things going on in the gaming world.
2799960	2803020	So Loki, why don't you start us off?
2803020	2807260	The Xbox Series X is going to be coming out later this year, so we know now which month.
2807260	2810300	That's going to be November.
2810300	2812820	Now one thing that is from November.
2812820	2816020	Did we ever doubt that it wasn't going to be November?
2816020	2818020	It could have been October.
2818020	2822640	All right, all right, all right.
2822640	2828520	So anyways, it's going to be coming out, but Sans Halo Infinite, unfortunately Halo Infinite
2828520	2836760	has been delayed to 2021, I'm sure partially because of the reactions to the gameplay trailer
2836760	2841920	that they had that were less than preferred.
2841920	2846740	But they did say that there's going to be 50 new games that are playing to launch this
2846740	2851600	year across generations, and they'll be optimized for Xbox Series X.
2851600	2858300	And also, I think they said a total of 1,000 games across four generations of consoles.
2858300	2861720	So lots of stuff with Game Pass and all that.
2861720	2864000	So we'll see.
2864000	2868320	I'm excited about it, but Halo Infinite not coming out, it's not a deal breaker for me.
2868320	2873980	I'm not a huge Halo fan, but I would prefer that they polish it so it doesn't look like
2873980	2874980	it did.
2874980	2875980	Yeah.
2875980	2878140	I already kind of made my thoughts on Halo known.
2878140	2879520	I am a Halo fan.
2879520	2881280	I've maybe fallen out of favor a little bit.
2881280	2885180	Like it's kind of lost me a little bit with some of the newer titles, but I was a fan
2885180	2888460	of the fact that they're going for a more classic looking Halo game.
2888460	2892520	I'm enticed by the fact it sounds like they might put a battle royale, because I think
2892520	2895520	the multiplayer in Halo is a lot of fun, even if I suck at it.
2895520	2898160	I think a battle royale type mode could be a lot of fun.
2898160	2899160	Note that that was never before.
2899160	2902000	With the battle royale type mode that's in it, it's like Fall Guys.
2902000	2903000	Yeah.
2903000	2904220	Well, we'll see.
2904220	2907420	There's some mechanic-y things in Halo too sometimes.
2907420	2908420	So we'll see.
2909300	2912060	At the end of the day, if the game's not ready, it's not ready.
2912060	2915260	And for whatever reason they pushed it back, then yeah, push it back.
2915260	2916580	Take the time you need.
2916580	2918820	Still, it's a pretty shocking delay.
2918820	2922820	I mean, that is like Nintendo pushing back a Mario game for launch or something.
2922820	2926060	It's a huge title.
2926060	2927400	Didn't they do that though?
2927400	2931380	Was Mario Odyssey originally supposed to be a launch title or is that not?
2931380	2932380	Maybe.
2932380	2933380	I don't know.
2933380	2934380	Maybe.
2934380	2935380	You're probably right.
2935380	2936380	Maybe.
2936380	2937380	But they did have the Zelda.
2937380	2942060	Although the Zelda came out on two systems, they really only advertised it for one.
2942060	2944060	The Breath of the Wild.
2944060	2947740	Assuming that Mario Odyssey was delayed, does anyone remember?
2947740	2948740	No.
2948740	2952060	Same thing when the Xbox Series X came out.
2952060	2955780	Once it comes out, no one's going to remember that it was delayed or going to care.
2955780	2961660	But it was supposed to be like a big thing to get a Series X for, so I do hope Microsoft
2961660	2967260	has a long game plan or that they are adjusting their expectations for the holiday sales of
2967260	2970100	the Series X accordingly.
2970100	2973740	Maybe this is a blessing in disguise if there's going to be hardware manufacturing issues,
2973740	2976060	although we haven't heard a lot about that or anything.
2976060	2978300	So I mean, we'll see.
2978300	2984100	But I'm kind of curious to see what Xbox Series X is going to look like in that launch window.
2984100	2986820	Although I'm not going to lie, I'm probably still going to get one.
2986820	2987820	Yeah.
2987820	2990060	I mean, it's fine there.
2990060	2991300	Hopefully there'll be other things.
2991300	2993260	I know Games Pass will help.
2993260	2994260	This is exactly it.
2994460	3000580	Removing the cost of, say, Xbox Live Gold might even help more, but all in good time.
3000580	3001580	All those announcements.
3001580	3002580	We don't even know what cost yet.
3002580	3005900	Yeah, because you might ask me, why are you going to get an Xbox Series X?
3005900	3008700	The answer is Game Pass.
3008700	3010640	Because there'll already be a ton of games to play.
3010640	3014060	And then I'm not going to be able to get it through the iOS store because the launcher's
3014060	3018900	been taken down, and how am I going to buy my console then?
3018900	3021020	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, Animal Crossing was delayed.
3021020	3022220	Smash Brothers was delayed.
3022220	3024420	SJ100Matt says, Metroid Prime 4 was pushed.
3024420	3027380	Yes, yes, and yes, none of those games launch titles.
3027380	3028380	So that's the only thing.
3028380	3030260	And I'm not saying I'm mad or anything.
3030260	3033420	No, again, if they need to take the time to get it right, take time to get it right.
3033420	3037700	But it's just interesting what's that going to do when that was the big anchor title I
3037700	3041340	kind of thought as far as launching the system.
3041340	3046020	It's just going to be interesting, and I hope Microsoft lowers their expectations accordingly.
3046020	3052500	I would hate to see Microsoft write the Xbox Series X Office a failure when Halo wasn't
3052500	3055180	there ready to go day one, and maybe it'll still do very well.
3055180	3056180	I don't know.
3056180	3057180	But we'll see.
3057180	3064220	But I also think, again, if a lot of the strength of Microsoft can be measured in Game Pass,
3064220	3068480	and how much of that they push on PC, and how much of that they push on console, whatever
3068480	3073100	it is, I do think Microsoft will still make a lot of wins there.
3073100	3077180	Microsoft has that flight simulator coming out this week, and that's going to be a big
3077180	3079420	win for Game Pass, in my opinion, too.
3079420	3083540	And I think a good reason to get Game Pass, because why pay all that money for a flight
3083540	3088700	simulator when you, I think, isn't PC Game Pass like five bucks a month?
3088700	3091180	Like it's pretty cheap.
3091180	3094700	Don't know, because I think when you buy the one now, you get both.
3094700	3097380	So I'm not sure if, maybe it's Games Pass Ultimate.
3097380	3098380	I don't know.
3098380	3103260	But yeah, I know it's less expensive, because there's less games available.
3103260	3110500	I kind of wish that if I bought the PC one, I could stream all my Xbox games to the PC,
3110500	3114020	since there's not all of them.
3114020	3117860	That would definitely sell me one.
3117860	3122420	S-H-O 100 Matt says, I would like to think anyone coming out with new tech in 2020 has
3122420	3123420	expectations tempered.
3123420	3124420	At least they should.
3124420	3125420	True.
3125460	3130020	Hani Hanumea says, total respect to Microsoft for courage to delay Halo.
3130020	3133340	That's a really well said point, although isn't courage an Apple word?
3133340	3134340	I'm just kidding.
3134340	3135340	I had to.
3135340	3136340	Cheap shot.
3136340	3137340	I had to take it.
3137340	3141860	V.G. Realness says, not sure if it was already stated, but what is Sony really launching
3141860	3146300	with anyways, besides Miles Morales, which is also PlayStation 4?
3146300	3149700	That is a damn good question, and we don't know.
3149700	3152240	And that is one that Sony, I think, should answer as well.
3152240	3157200	So it could be very interesting that on both sides of the house, Microsoft and Sony, we
3157200	3165640	might see, I don't want to say weak lineups, but maybe lineups different than what we've
3165640	3167920	seen in the past.
3167920	3173160	But I think we're also going to see a big lenience, especially on Microsoft's side,
3173160	3178800	of play the games you already know the best on this new system.
3178800	3182420	And I think that's going to be a huge part of Microsoft's messaging since PlayStation
3182420	3186040	still not talking about backwards compatibility, really.
3186040	3187040	We don't know.
3187040	3188600	But a lot can change in the next month.
3188600	3193560	But I think big moves are going to have to start happening this month.
3193560	3194880	It's mid-August.
3194880	3200280	So I really I would have thought before Labor Day was kind of like the deadline for Sony
3200280	3204540	and Microsoft to lay bare what is the launch day going to look like.
3204540	3206440	But maybe they're going to cut it closer.
3206440	3207440	I don't know.
3207440	3213280	And to invoke Apple, Apple can do a huge fucking event and be like, there's a brand new phone
3213280	3217420	in three days and it'll still sell cuckoo bananas.
3217420	3221160	So that might not be a good idea in the state of our postal.
3221160	3227800	Well, not necessarily the post office, but like even UPS and FedEx and all of those companies
3227800	3231920	are very backlogged as far as what's being delivered.
3231920	3235640	Perhaps not the best time to hold off your preorders, you know, or like even shipments
3235640	3236640	for that stuff.
3236640	3242920	In fact, we had a recent story that one of the UPS facilities in California was putting
3242920	3246140	things in the pile instead of delivering them.
3246140	3248920	So I don't know.
3248920	3252880	I would rather we know the information sooner than later, but I know that they're waiting.
3252880	3254840	They want to counter Sony on that stuff.
3254840	3261120	And once again, billion dollar companies fighting over billions of dollars.
3261120	3265520	VG Realness and chat says it seems like both launches are going to be lackluster.
3265520	3269880	They should just both delay and call it a day since they can't seem to pick a date and
3269880	3275320	price playing this bullshit capped cat and mouse game.
3275320	3278600	And that's shown under Matt piggybacks off that to say something similar to what you
3278600	3279640	just said.
3279640	3285060	And again, another situation where two companies are playing chicken about announcing the price.
3285060	3287880	We consumers are stuck in the middle of it.
3287880	3293320	So here we just why don't let's let's bring Sony and Microsoft into the room.
3293320	3294320	Okay, walk in.
3294320	3295320	Okay.
3295320	3296320	Fuck you.
3296320	3297320	Fuck you.
3297320	3298320	Fuck you.
3298320	3299320	Fuck you.
3299320	3303840	Well, also playing cat and mouse with the price of a system during the nation's greatest
3303840	3305760	recession in history.
3305760	3309480	I mean, or what's going to be probably the greatest recession.
3309480	3313920	Yeah, I don't think technically the recession hasn't hit levels of like, let's say the 1930s
3313920	3319840	or the the last one we had in the aughts, but at the time of this thing, yeah, fair.
3319840	3320840	All right.
3320840	3322220	Let's move on, shall we?
3323180	3326260	Let's talk about a game you're not going to be able to buy on the new console.
3326260	3329060	And that is Forza Horizon 3.
3329060	3333740	Forza Horizon 3 is being moved to an end of life status, meaning it will no longer be
3333740	3336120	on sale after September.
3336120	3338660	So Forza Horizon 3 came out in 2016.
3338660	3341660	It's done very well critically.
3341660	3342860	And it's a good fucking game.
3342860	3343860	I own it.
3343860	3344860	I'm a fan.
3344860	3346860	I love the Forza Horizon series.
3346900	3352300	I think it's one of Microsoft's strongest titles, especially when it comes to exclusives.
3352300	3357740	I can't fucking wait until they announce Forza 5 for the Xbox Series X, because it seems
3357740	3359620	like that will happen eventually.
3359620	3360620	But of course, you have this whole...
3360620	3361620	Horizon 5.
3361620	3362620	What's that?
3362620	3363620	Did I say...
3363620	3364620	Forza Horizon 5.
3364620	3365620	You know what I meant.
3365620	3368320	Forza Horizon 5 for the Series X.
3368320	3371980	But of course, we have this whole interesting thing now where that same studio did so fucking
3371980	3375100	well with Forza Horizon, now they're doing Fable.
3375100	3378820	So you know, now I might kind of have to wait a little bit.
3378820	3382340	But anyway, Forza Horizon 3 not going to be available anymore.
3382340	3385360	And this is likely due to licensing agreements.
3385360	3388060	They do have music that plays during the game and so forth.
3388060	3393660	And sometimes, as opposed to patching it out, it's just easier to not sell it anymore.
3393660	3400240	The same thing happened to Forza Horizon 2, by the way, which was an Xbox One launch title.
3400240	3407040	If memory serves me right, I believe it was released on the 360 and the Xbox One, that
3407040	3408040	same holiday.
3408040	3411000	And that was delisted in 2018.
3411000	3413520	And that's interesting, because that would be the same timeframe.
3413520	3415960	That would be, what, about four years since launch.
3415960	3420640	So whatever licensing agreements or whatever was in place must expire.
3420640	3429040	So Horizon 3, no longer available in September 27.
3429040	3431520	That means all of the DLC as well.
3431520	3435880	So if you want to get things like that hot, was it the Hot Wheels was in three?
3435880	3438460	Hot Wheels is in three, Lego is in four, right?
3438460	3439960	So yeah.
3439960	3444600	So if you want to get that stuff, you got to get it because it's going to be going away.
3444600	3448400	What I think is interesting about this, now games get delisted all the time.
3448400	3451280	We don't necessarily see a first party game getting delisted.
3451280	3454560	Oh, by the way, if you already own the game, you're going to be fine.
3454560	3458240	If you need to re-download it because you own it, you're fine.
3458240	3462860	If you have a disc version, you're buying it used to GameStop or whatever, you're fine.
3462860	3467720	It's just you can no longer buy a new copy on the marketplace.
3467720	3471680	But I think what's interesting about this is that I would have considered the Horizon
3471680	3475200	series one of the great things about Game Pass.
3475200	3478840	And so it is interesting because I've always just assumed, oh, Game Pass is just going
3478840	3481820	to have all the first person Microsoft titles.
3481820	3484740	But sometimes those titles are going to get sunsetted.
3484740	3486860	And not everything first party is available yet.
3486860	3493220	And maybe some of the tricky licensing agreements are part of the reason why.
3493220	3498600	Now for what it's worth, Forza Horizon 2, I distinctly remember was a games with gold
3498600	3501180	game right before it went away.
3501180	3503340	So a lot of people had a chance to grab it.
3503340	3507940	And so hopefully they'll do the same thing with Horizon 3 next month.
3507940	3511820	It's going to have to be next month because it goes away at the end of September.
3511820	3512820	But we'll see.
3512820	3513820	They haven't announced that yet.
3513900	3515100	But it is a sale.
3515100	3519940	You can get it like 67% off, which I think, what, like $9.99 or something like that is
3519940	3520940	the price of the game right now.
3520940	3521940	It's pretty cheap.
3521940	3523940	It's a damn good racing game again.
3523940	3528260	If you haven't tried the Horizon series, give it a go.
3528260	3529420	It's not a simulator.
3529420	3532680	It's an arcade style racer and it works very well.
3532680	3534380	So I'm a big fan.
3534380	3537300	So check that out.
3537300	3538300	Let's move on with our next story.
3538300	3539300	Loki.
3539780	3547180	Alright, so we talked a little bit about Xbox and PlayStation both getting a lot of games
3547180	3550700	that are being upgraded to next gen for free.
3550700	3556700	So unfortunately, one of these games that's not going to necessarily be upgraded is Control.
3556700	3561780	So Control, the original game, came out quite a while ago.
3561780	3567780	And now what they're doing instead is they're only going to be upgrading the ultimate edition
3567780	3568780	of Control.
3569740	3572300	So in order to get that, you have to pay $40.
3572300	3577140	It's basically kind of the sort of game of the year edition of Control with the DLC thrown
3577140	3578140	in there.
3578140	3582380	But it's going to, that version will be upgraded, but not the original version.
3582380	3585980	So not only people that paid full price for that are getting a little bit penalized, especially
3585980	3590260	if you bought the DLC for it as well, but in order to get it to play on the PlayStation
3590260	3596020	5 or Xbox Series X, you have to purchase it again for $40, which is kind of ridiculous.
3596020	3598020	I'm not sure why they would do that.
3598460	3599980	That's the choice that they made.
3599980	3600980	Yeah.
3600980	3605180	I mean, it really depends how much they're putting into it because, you know, like take
3605180	3607300	a game like Saints Row the Third, right?
3607300	3611100	They just recently did that whole new remaster and you didn't get it for free, right?
3611100	3616260	You had to rebuy the game, but you got a remastered product.
3616260	3617460	It looks a lot different.
3617460	3620060	It looks a lot cleaner and so forth.
3620060	3622260	So some would argue it's worth it.
3622260	3627420	So if they're going to be taking the type of time to make those same type of changes
3627460	3630220	to control, then maybe it's a little more justified.
3630220	3635220	But if it's just like, oh, it's just a port for PlayStation 5, then blah, you know?
3635220	3636220	Yeah.
3636220	3645100	But I mean, to argue, basically, if you're making the assets for one version of control,
3645100	3649940	it's really not going to cost you any more to upgrade both versions.
3649940	3652900	I mean, that would be the logical sense is, hey, you know what?
3652900	3656860	We're going to be upgrading this so that you can play it on the next gen consoles.
3656860	3660220	And on top of that, if you haven't purchased it yet, you can get it for 40 bucks.
3660220	3661660	It's at a discount.
3661660	3666100	That would make them kind of out to be like the good guys here, you know, offering a pretty
3666100	3670140	decent deal for those who might be excited to get into that now that we've seen, you
3670140	3672740	know, some next gen footage of it or something.
3672740	3676700	But instead, they're paywalling it to try to I don't see how that's going to really
3676700	3681060	get people that own the original version of control to like, oh, well, I better jump on
3681060	3682060	that.
3682060	3685260	I mean, that's kind of ridiculous.
3685260	3686700	They can definitely do that.
3686700	3691140	I don't think it's a good decision, but I think really they should do both versions
3691140	3692900	that they're going to make the assets for it.
3692900	3697180	They're not changing the engine it's running in and it's the same game just with the DLC
3697180	3698180	thrown in.
3698180	3701580	So you're making the assets for this version to be upgraded anyways.
3701580	3703180	Why can't you do both?
3703180	3707620	I honestly feel like control will be one of those things and this not to shade a game
3707620	3711480	that honestly I haven't played and I need to because the studio always does make really
3711480	3714540	good games and control obviously got some very good reviews.
3714540	3715920	It's like on my list.
3716320	3717820	You know what this news tells me?
3717820	3719380	This news says up, stop.
3719380	3720420	Don't bother with it now.
3720420	3724080	Wait for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X at this point because you're wasting your time
3724080	3725080	doing it now.
3725080	3726240	Or how about this?
3726240	3727240	You know what?
3727240	3730920	Oh, you want to you want me to pay another $40 for the ultimate edition?
3730920	3731920	No, thank you.
3731920	3734660	I'll just wait for it to go down to $5 or $19.99.
3734660	3739180	That was exactly what I was going to say is that I feel like control on PS5 and Xbox Series
3739180	3745000	X is going to be one of those things 90 days and it'll be half off if that 90 days out
3745000	3746640	and it'll be half off.
3746640	3747640	Just wait for sale.
3747640	3750200	I mean, I'm sorry.
3750200	3751920	It seems like double dipping.
3751920	3753140	I just don't get it.
3753140	3758080	It would be different if this was to your example of Saints Row.
3758080	3760480	Saints Row was a game that came out on PlayStation 3.
3760480	3765360	They remastered everything for the PlayStation 4 version and they put it on other systems
3765360	3766360	as well.
3766360	3770400	So they went in, they had to redo the whole engine, they had to upgrade all the visuals.
3770400	3774480	That's different than say we're adding some additional features to make it look nicer
3774480	3777640	on the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5.
3777640	3780840	They're not rebuilding the whole game from the ground up, I think.
3780840	3786460	But at the same time, there have been other things like Bioshock, that series.
3786460	3792000	I want to say that they did free updates, remastered editions, if you will, for those
3792000	3793640	who already bought the original ones.
3793640	3796960	They didn't want to punish those people, but at the same time, they were also selling that
3796960	3798860	on its own.
3798860	3800600	You know what y'all better be ready for?
3800600	3802240	You know what y'all better be ready for?
3802240	3805000	The same thing's going to happen with Final Fantasy 7 Remake.
3805000	3806000	Mark my words.
3806000	3808160	It's going to happen with Final Fantasy 7 Remake.
3808160	3810400	It's not going to be a free upgrade, they're going to do a new.
3810400	3815280	And it'll all be timed with the exclusive window lapsing for PlayStation.
3815280	3819200	So there will be an Xbox Series X release, a PlayStation 5 release.
3819200	3821720	I almost said Nintendo Switch, but no.
3821720	3824720	So there'll be a PlayStation 5 and maybe a PC, I don't know.
3824720	3830320	But there'll be a release on all those platforms and it'll be some type of Uber edition that
3830320	3832720	has like an extra.
3832720	3834800	Maybe Red 13 will be playable.
3834800	3835800	I don't know.
3835800	3838500	But they're going to do like an extra something something to be like, oh, it's got something
3838500	3845480	new and make people buy it again in anticipation for when the second part of the remake story
3845480	3848240	comes out whenever that ends up being.
3848240	3851240	But I'm telling you, it's going to happen.
3851240	3852240	And that's fine.
3852240	3853240	I don't know.
3853240	3854240	I just.
3854240	3855240	It's whatever.
3855240	3858320	I mean, you know, vote with your wallet.
3858320	3862960	So if you think it's reasonable to purchase the original game and you really, really,
3862960	3867240	really want to get it, you know, for the next gen system, maybe you didn't buy the DLC for
3867240	3868240	it.
3868240	3869240	I mean, then fine.
3869240	3870240	Repurchase the game.
3870240	3873480	But like, if I wouldn't, I would just wait.
3873480	3878360	I would seriously, especially if you if you have already purchased the game, then you
3878360	3882400	don't need to run out and purchase the game right away just to play it on another console.
3882400	3886120	I'm assuming you probably have already played through the game as it is.
3886120	3890420	And at that point, just wait, just go back and play the original version again.
3890420	3895880	Then again, you're talking to somebody who bought Mass Effect three, four times and is
3895880	3898800	about ready to do a fifth time as soon as they announce that.
3898800	3901000	But it wasn't on the same console, though.
3901000	3902000	That wasn't the same.
3902000	3903000	It wasn't the same console.
3903000	3905960	I mean, I don't know.
3905960	3907480	It's just silly.
3907480	3908480	It is silly.
3908480	3914720	But once again, it is we're in a capitalist society, so we can go ahead and they can do
3914720	3916120	whatever decisions they want.
3916120	3919040	And if we support it with our wallets and they'll continue to do that, if you don't
3919040	3920280	like it, then don't buy it.
3920280	3922520	I only paid full price for it once.
3922520	3923520	Let's be clear.
3923520	3924520	All right.
3924520	3926120	Anyway, let's move on.
3926120	3928900	Let's talk about someone that's not going to be getting full price.
3928900	3932000	That is going to be the executives at EA.
3932000	3939200	So what happened is that investors actually voted down a proposal for EA to pay their
3939200	3940200	executives.
3940200	3944240	It's interesting because EA is not having a bad year, notably.
3944240	3947480	Video games are performing relatively strongly, and that includes EA.
3947480	3951980	I mean, it might not be like Nintendo level strong, but EA is performing strongly due
3951980	3954340	to the coronavirus and everything that's going on.
3954340	3956520	More people are staying home and playing video games.
3956520	3960360	Apex Legends is doing very well and so on and so on.
3960360	3966720	However, investors cast one hundred and seventy one million votes against an EA executive
3966720	3967880	pay package.
3967880	3971560	Apparently sixty million votes were in favor.
3971560	3972560	That's kind of interesting.
3972560	3976760	I guess some of the issue that happened was that EA was rewarding executives with secondary
3976760	3981000	stock awards before the first ones had been vested.
3981000	3983680	So that wasn't a whole issue as well.
3983680	3990960	EA apparently went to per CTW Investment Group said EA went, quote, too far in terms of executive
3990960	3997760	pay, piling on exorbitant equity awards while paying multimillion dollar bonuses following
3997760	3999320	worker layoffs.
3999320	4003400	And that's talking about what happened with EA Melbourne fire monkeys.
4003400	4007320	So very interesting.
4007320	4012840	To put some of this like to put some money numbers on this, the chief technology officer
4012840	4019460	Kenneth Moss and chief financial officer Blake Jorgensen get six hundred and ninety
4019460	4025120	one thousand dollars in change and eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year each.
4025120	4032240	But they also get these equity grants worth seven point five million and five point five
4032240	4033240	million.
4033240	4036240	That's a lot of money.
4036240	4039200	How are they going to live without all that extra money?
4039200	4042800	I mean, like, oh, they're going to what are we going to fill the money pit with?
4042800	4044920	That's potentially homeless at that point.
4044920	4045920	So anyway.
4045920	4046920	Yeah.
4046920	4053560	So EA responded to Bloomberg Financial magazine saying the board and compensation committee
4053560	4058560	will take their feedback into account as part of our ongoing evaluation of our compensation
4058560	4059560	programs.
4059560	4064220	So finally, people are stepping up and saying maybe you're making too much fucking money.
4064220	4070200	So that's kind of interesting, especially I do like that it's called out that like,
4070200	4074080	you can't fucking lay off all these people in Melbourne and then take these gigantic
4074080	4075080	packages.
4075080	4081080	That's Activision's job.
4081080	4085600	And what's interesting is that that's coming from the investors of EA, not within EA.
4085600	4091440	So SSJ 100 Matt says they will have to settle for a twenty twenty Ferrari instead of a twenty
4091440	4094520	twenty one.
4094520	4098920	Phoenix seventy seven twenty six says they can't get their third boat.
4098920	4101520	Four babies.
4101520	4104960	All right.
4104960	4108160	Phoenix seventy seven twenty six says I'm already eating the rich.
4108160	4109880	I can't handle any more.
4109880	4110880	All right.
4110880	4111880	Let's move on.
4111880	4115840	Loki, speaking of some executive shuffling, right?
4115840	4116840	Yes.
4116840	4125560	So we first have Assassin's Creed creative director who has been let go of the company.
4125560	4133440	Basraf Ismail, he stepped down from his role in June after being accused of pursuing extramarital
4133440	4137500	relationships with women under false pretense because, you know, Ubisoft was having a lot
4137500	4140580	of these issues come up recently.
4140580	4147400	So of course, he has left the company because of the investigation to his misconduct, which
4147400	4152560	apparently they've found out that they're somebody that was warranted, I guess.
4152560	4155200	They said following investigation by an external firm.
4155200	4159680	It was determined that Ashraf's employment with Ubisoft had to be terminated.
4159680	4160680	So basically.
4160680	4161680	Yeah.
4161680	4163840	You know, all those things that people were saying that was happening at Ubisoft.
4163840	4164840	Yeah.
4164840	4166240	They were happening in Ubisoft.
4166240	4173680	So I expect that this won't be the last that we'll hear of people leaving that company
4173680	4181840	and completely other news, though, and not related to sexual misconduct allegations.
4181840	4189040	Laslo Jones, who is one of the developers or the minds behind, is to say the Grand Theft
4189040	4191160	Auto series since Grand Theft Auto three.
4191160	4195520	He also plays a fictional version of himself, kind of like almost like a Howard Stern type
4195520	4202160	character on the in-game radios within the series as well.
4202160	4208480	He's actually left the company as of back in April, and he's actually left to go work
4208480	4210440	on some different projects as well.
4210440	4217520	So he's, I believe, gone to Netflix and are developing shows for both Netflix and Disney,
4217520	4221400	as well as doing consulting work for video game companies.
4221400	4223760	So that's more of a positive note.
4223760	4231840	But yeah, it's nice to hear people actually going leaving because of opportunity growth
4231840	4232840	opportunities.
4232840	4233840	Yes.
4233840	4236240	Instead of being shown the door.
4236240	4237680	Yes, exactly.
4237680	4238680	Yes.
4238920	4241080	That individual needed to be shown the door.
4241080	4246200	So I'm glad to hear Ubisoft is taking the steps they need to take that we all kind of
4246200	4247200	saw coming.
4247200	4248200	So that's good.
4248200	4251600	But yeah, these are kind of this is a weird pairing to put together.
4251600	4255440	Sorry, but it's, you know, it's executive changes at companies, I suppose.
4255440	4258520	But yeah, it'll be interesting to see what Laslo is going to be working on, especially
4258520	4261600	with that, you know, kind of resume Grand Theft Auto four or five.
4261600	4264320	These are huge games that made buku bucks.
4264320	4267260	Could it be a Grand Theft Auto game for Netflix?
4267260	4268260	Probably not.
4268260	4270980	Maybe something that that feels like it.
4270980	4274380	He's just probably I mean, because it's a really huge game series.
4274380	4279140	I mean, so I can imagine that, you know, he has a lot of industry knowledge as well.
4279140	4284300	And maybe if they whenever at this point, like I'm not holding my breath or anything,
4284300	4288440	they do a Grand Theft Auto six at some point when you when they're tired of rereleasing
4288440	4293740	Grand Theft Auto five for the millionth time, then maybe they'll have him back as a guest
4293740	4296640	DJ again to, you know, reprise his role.
4296640	4299360	But we'll see.
4299360	4303720	Or or his cousin, Laszlo will take over.
4303720	4304720	Who knows?
4304720	4305720	All right.
4305720	4306720	Yeah.
4306720	4307720	Anyway.
4307720	4308720	All right.
4308720	4309720	Let's move on.
4309720	4313000	We're going to go to the classic game of the week.
4313000	4316920	So every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and
4316920	4321100	finds a game that she thinks, hey, you brats out there on the Internet, you should be playing
4321100	4322100	this game.
4322100	4323940	Dark Sakura sadly is not here tonight.
4323940	4326080	She will be back with us next week.
4326080	4327940	So tonight I have picked a game for us.
4327940	4332280	But, Loki, I would say, pay attention, because I really tried to pick a game tonight.
4332280	4335360	And I think you will very much approve of my selection tonight.
4335360	4339200	And you don't even know what it is yet, because I made a boo boo on the show role.
4339200	4340800	So I'll give you a hint, Loki.
4340800	4345440	This is a game we have talked about like a million times on this show.
4345440	4350160	And somehow it has never been a classic game of the week, like a lot of things can be a
4350160	4351160	lot of games.
4351160	4354000	This game inspired other games.
4354000	4356920	And I think one of them was a classic game of the week not that long ago.
4356920	4360440	And that was probably the last time this game came up.
4360440	4367200	This is a game that I used to play in my junior high school PC lab on lunch, where my friends
4367200	4369200	and I were trying to kill each other with nukes.
4372920	4376600	Oh, I have a feeling I know what it is.
4376600	4377600	All right.
4377600	4380360	Well, if you guessed scorched earth, you're oops, that's the wrong.
4380360	4381360	Sorry.
4381360	4382360	Oh, darn it.
4382360	4383360	Sorry.
4383720	4384720	That was the wrong footage.
4384720	4385720	My bad.
4385720	4386720	That does not look like scorched earth.
4386720	4387720	That was not scorched earth.
4387720	4388720	That is something else.
4388720	4389720	Yep.
4389720	4390720	Yep.
4390720	4391720	Yep.
4391720	4392720	We'll talk about that.
4392720	4393840	I just spoiled something big.
4393840	4394840	That's coming up later.
4394840	4396120	We'll talk about that later.
4396120	4398360	I fucking love live, don't you?
4398360	4399360	Let's try this instead.
4399360	4400360	There we go.
4400360	4401360	There's scorched earth.
4401360	4403160	I hit the wrong goddamn thing.
4403160	4404160	All right.
4404160	4405160	All right.
4405160	4406160	There you go.
4406160	4407600	Scorched earth is the classic game of the week.
4407600	4415160	So scorched earth is a game that came out for good old MS-DOS in 1991.
4415160	4420420	So the developer of this game was a guy named Wendell Hicken, and that's it.
4420420	4426220	It was him because, you know, back in the old days of gaming, games were created by
4426220	4428100	one person.
4428100	4429420	And this is an example of that.
4429420	4434820	So this game was released shareware, meaning that you basically got the entire fucking
4434820	4440420	game for free, but it just asked you to kindly pay him money, which I bet very few people
4440420	4441420	did.
4441420	4442420	But actually, Logie, didn't you pay for this?
4442420	4444940	I thought this was one of the ones you said you did.
4444940	4446500	I think I don't remember.
4446500	4447500	It was so long ago.
4447500	4450060	I most likely did.
4450060	4453780	I thought that it wasn't the shareware version, then they have some weapons locked or something
4453780	4454780	like that.
4454780	4455780	That might have been the case.
4455780	4460140	I think some weapons, I think some of the field generation and things like that looked
4460140	4461660	a little different and so forth.
4461660	4466860	So there is all of that too.
4466860	4471260	So anyhow, Scorched Earth is a turn-based artillery game.
4471260	4474260	So again, it's very similar to like Worms.
4474260	4478940	Worms came after this, and Worms was very inspired by a game like this.
4478940	4481420	Tank Wars would be another example of an early game.
4481420	4485580	I almost went with that, but Tank Wars and Scorched Earth are really cut from the same
4485580	4489420	cloth and they're almost interchangeable, almost.
4489700	4492860	It's all about the angle and the power.
4492860	4497120	And you use that to shoot your weapon and see what happens.
4497120	4500900	And you can notice if you're watching on Twitch, you can see that these tanks, I think there's
4500900	4505300	one human player and there's like nine fake computer players.
4505300	4508100	And you'll notice they're all trying to kill each other by lobbing these weapons at each
4508100	4509100	other.
4509100	4511420	But the human player can actually change their weapons.
4511420	4516020	So I think they're firing now like a slightly bigger missile than the baby missiles the
4516020	4517860	others are firing off.
4517860	4520460	So obviously the goal is to kill the other tanks.
4520460	4526060	But as you fire your weapon, you're also changing the environment, which is a good lesson about
4526060	4530460	war is that the more you fire off nukes, the more mountains you're going to destroy.
4530460	4533940	So there is certainly that as well.
4533940	4538280	Scorched Earth referred to itself as the mother of all games.
4538280	4539780	Do you know where this comes from?
4539780	4542740	It's because this game was released in 1991.
4542740	4545140	That's when the Gulf War was going on.
4545140	4549620	That was after Saddam Hussein said to the U.S. if they walked on Iraqi soil, it would
4549620	4552540	be the mother of all battles.
4552540	4555540	So that's where the name the mother of all games came from.
4555540	4558340	I never knew that until I logged onto Wikipedia.
4558340	4559900	How about that?
4559900	4562740	Anyway, there's also environmental issues.
4562740	4566420	For example, the stage they're playing on now, I believe meteors will randomly fall
4566420	4567540	or it's the lightning bolts.
4567540	4571560	One of the two will randomly fall and could affect tanks destroying.
4571560	4574460	Tanks blowing up could do different things.
4574500	4578940	Some of them do like elaborate firework shows that will kill everything.
4578940	4582100	Some of them just do a little like poop and it's gone.
4582100	4586100	Or I think the beam up happens like when I was looking at this before the show.
4586100	4588580	Like there's two or three different ones that just beam up.
4588580	4592020	So they kind of like dig into the soil and then they just beam up out of the stress.
4592020	4594300	It doesn't really hurt other people.
4594300	4599740	But yeah, and sometimes seeing the elaborate ways that tanks would die is what made this
4599740	4600740	game worth playing.
4600740	4601740	Right, Loki?
4602420	4606460	Yeah, I like also being able to earn money between rounds and you get to purchase weapons
4606460	4607460	with that.
4607460	4608460	Yes.
4608460	4614460	And apparently you can edit the configuration files, TOC 1 CFG and TOC 2 CFG.
4614460	4618340	You can edit those configuration files so that the tanks say whatever you want them
4618340	4619340	to say.
4619340	4621980	Yes, you can.
4621980	4624020	Loki is very aware with this.
4624020	4629140	Anyways, there's all sorts of weapons and there's shields and things get crazy.
4629140	4633940	And again, if you've seen Worms, Worms was very inspired by a game like this, so you
4633940	4635740	kind of know where it's going.
4635740	4639300	But we need to pay respect to the games that came before it, which Squirt's Earth is a
4639300	4640860	great example of.
4640860	4644820	You can play this with up to 10 players, so that could either be live people or computer
4644820	4645860	controlled people.
4645860	4649480	So like I said, sometimes we would eat lunch in the science classroom where there were
4649480	4653020	some PCs and there would be like five of us and the teacher didn't care.
4653020	4656920	He thought it was great that we he looked at it as we were learning and we weren't getting
4656920	4657920	into trouble.
4657920	4661320	He loved it that we would come in his class and play these games, you know, because it's
4661320	4662700	not like they're that violent.
4662700	4665920	I mean, sure, the tanks explode, but it's not like you see burning bodies and things
4665920	4666920	like that.
4666920	4668940	It's pretty tame, all things considered.
4668940	4674320	The last version of the game, 1.5, was released in 1995.
4674320	4680420	You can actually download this game right now on the official site Wiccan.com.
4680420	4683840	That's W-H-I-C-K-E-N dot com.
4683840	4687500	And if you're willing to kick back a donation, he kind of has to pay what you want for like
4687500	4691780	an all encompassing package that allows you to modify the game to your heart's content
4691780	4693100	and all of that as well.
4693100	4694920	So I think that's pretty cool.
4694920	4697540	So yeah, there it is.
4697540	4701380	Your classic game of the week is scorched earth.
4701380	4707080	Other games inspired by this, not just worms, but things like atomic tanks, nasty armored
4707080	4713820	tanks of war, X scorch, scorch tanks, scorch 3D, whole lot of games that were inspired
4713820	4715760	by scorched earth and again, worms.
4715760	4718420	I think that's the one that everybody kind of knows is worms.
4718420	4724120	So I'm telling you, Tommy Tallarico, they need to get this on the Amico.
4724120	4728360	I mean, that's a, that's a game seller or console seller right there.
4728360	4730980	Do you think, I mean, this seems like the type of thing that could be pretty easily
4730980	4732820	adaptable for the Amico.
4732820	4738440	I mean, if you, if you say in television Amico three times into the mirror, Tommy Tallarico
4738440	4739900	will show up and send you a tweet.
4739900	4742120	So please elaborate.
4742120	4743120	Yeah.
4743120	4747120	All right.
4747120	4750140	That's going to do it for your classic game of the week.
4750140	4751140	So let's go back.
4751140	4754920	And of course my chat room just froze up anyway.
4754920	4755920	That's all right.
4755920	4756920	We'll get back into some other news.
4756920	4759560	So why don't we get into some rapid fire news, Loki?
4759560	4760560	Yeah.
4760560	4765640	So there's a whole bunch of interesting mods that are on some of these games that were
4765640	4771040	on the switch or in this case, the Wii U so breath of the wild, of course, lots of mods
4771040	4777520	for that because the emulation on PC is so good right now.
4777520	4781360	And one of the mods that's actually been made is incredibly elaborate.
4781360	4791120	So there's a mod developer Wai Kuteru who put out a mod that adds an entire race track
4791120	4795380	from Mario Kart 8.
4795380	4801980	So Luigi's, it looks like Luigi's race track and you can actually race if they made a mini
4801980	4802980	game out of it.
4802980	4808740	So you race the entire track on the master cycle while these obstacles kind of prevent
4808740	4810880	you from finishing the race.
4810880	4816020	So there's like a giant boulders, flame spouts, all sorts of things.
4816020	4820820	And you're supposed to race around the track to get a good time.
4820820	4825780	This is insane, the amount of effort that would have taken to put Luigi circuit in there.
4825780	4833660	But yeah, that's apparently a thing that people can do on these emulation devices to be able
4833660	4836020	to mod games in such crazy ways like this.
4836020	4839660	So I'm not sure where you can check this out.
4839660	4846660	I just know that they showed it on his YouTube channel, but apparently you can, I'm sure
4846660	4850620	you can get, oh, he has it through his Patreon so you can acquire it through there.
4850620	4853460	I'm assuming if you're a backer.
4853460	4857060	And then this is a game I would love to see come back.
4857060	4863180	So apparently Scott Pilgrim vs. the World of course was delisted a long time ago back in
4863180	4871420	2014, but apparently there's talks now that the creator Brian Lee O'Malley has been in
4871420	4877620	contact with Ubisoft and apparently they're going to try to work out some deal with Universal
4877620	4881460	Pictures to maybe bring the game back to modern consoles.
4881460	4882460	Yeah, he put out a tweet.
4882460	4884020	He put out a tweet about that.
4884020	4888180	Like it, like it was for, for a while it was like Ubisoft isn't calling, Ubisoft isn't
4888180	4889180	calling.
4889180	4891180	And then he put out a tweet this week that was like, they called.
4891180	4896500	Yeah, it was PS Ubisoft has reached out to me.
4896500	4898900	I mean, I would love for that to come back.
4898900	4901980	It was such a great game.
4901980	4904260	Such great artwork in there as well.
4904260	4907260	I would, I would love to see that.
4907300	4910340	Yeah, I'd be really excited to see that too.
4910340	4913460	And you know, the movie is having all this anniversary stuff going on because it's been,
4913460	4917020	I can't believe it's been 10 years since that movie came out, but it has, I know, right.
4917020	4919460	We all just felt our age right there.
4919460	4923380	But you know, there's like new soundtrack coming out because like the actual film version
4923380	4926580	of that song that Brie Larson sings is finally going to be out.
4926580	4929940	And I know a lot of people are very excited about that.
4929940	4933340	And then they had like a big zoom thing or something.
4933340	4934340	I don't know.
4934340	4937220	But like a lot of the cast did like stuff recently.
4937220	4940580	And you know, if we were able to do movies and events like that right now, we'd probably
4940580	4942660	be seeing a lot of cult screenings of it.
4942660	4946980	I actually hosted a screening of Scott Pilgrim.
4946980	4948580	It was about two years ago.
4948580	4951140	We did a, it was a double feature here.
4951140	4953900	They did Kung Fury and they did Scott Pilgrim.
4953900	4956260	It was like a gamer movie night.
4956260	4960940	And they actually had one of the actors from Kung Fury there, which was pretty cool.
4960940	4964340	Sadly, they were trying, I can't say who, but they were trying to get one of the people
4964340	4969140	from Scott Pilgrim, but it didn't end up working out with their schedule or what have you.
4969140	4973040	So I would have loved that, but they still showed the movie and it got a great response
4973040	4974040	from the crowd.
4974040	4978660	Like it's one of those movies that maybe, cause I don't think it did great at the box
4978660	4980440	office when it first came out.
4980440	4983980	But like, it's one of those movies that like, I think people of a certain age or just people
4983980	4989880	that love games, they really enjoy it so much that like when you get a theater full of people
4989880	4993880	that like Scott Pilgrim and like video games, it's a very different experience from when
4993920	4995940	I saw it in the theater the first time.
4995940	4997840	So I, that was fun.
4997840	5002400	And I wish, you know, if COVID wasn't a thing, you'd probably see a lot of anniversary screenings
5002400	5005520	going on right now, but yeah, bummer.
5005520	5007320	So all right.
5007320	5011720	Phoenix 7726 in chat says the comics got color versions too.
5011720	5012720	Really slick.
5012720	5017400	SSJ100 Matt says they were going to re-release the movie for Dolby Atmos theaters for the
5017400	5018800	10 year anniversary.
5018800	5023400	But COVID, oh, that sucks because obviously with the chiptune sound effects and everything
5023440	5026160	really cool that that movie brought, that's a bummer.
5026160	5027160	All right.
5027160	5033000	Moving on some other rapid fire stories here, Commander Keen, Keen Dreams is coming to Nintendo
5033000	5036400	Switch on August 27th, 2020.
5036400	5039920	Of course, this is an old throwback.
5039920	5041720	This is not a new Commander Keen game.
5041720	5047680	This is like a throwback title to like episode, I think this is the four or five and six episode.
5047680	5051920	I might be wrong because I think there is a Commander Keen series already on Switch.
5051920	5054720	And this one is like the next one coming out.
5054720	5060540	It is coming out, yeah, you can get the original Commander Keen and Keen Dreams for six bucks.
5060540	5068400	And then the Definitive Edition is 15 bucks for full widescreen support, 12 all new levels,
5068400	5071400	and it doubles the length of the original game and a full music score.
5071400	5073280	Well, that's pretty cool.
5073280	5074840	That must means Commander Keen did well enough.
5074840	5079640	You know, I almost made that the classic game of the week this week, but then it made me
5079640	5083400	think of MS-DOS games from the 90s and I thought of Scorched Earth and I was like,
5083400	5084880	oh, we need to do that one.
5084880	5086920	So all right.
5086920	5093240	Also in the rumor department, although it's a pretty substantial rumor because it's it's
5093240	5097460	from a picture, so it's probably happening.
5097460	5099440	It's unfortunately not.
5099440	5100440	Oh, really?
5100440	5101440	It was fate?
5101440	5102440	Yeah, it was.
5102440	5103440	Oh, bummer.
5103440	5104440	All right.
5104440	5105440	Well, apparently it was.
5105440	5106440	I just read about it.
5106440	5107440	Yeah.
5107440	5108440	All right.
5108440	5109440	It was supposed to be a Virtua Fighter cabinet.
5109440	5111680	Well, whoever photoshopped it did a really good job.
5111680	5112680	Kudos to them.
5112680	5113680	Who shot it down?
5113680	5116040	Did Sega say something or Arcade 1up said something about it?
5116040	5117040	Arcade 1up did.
5117040	5118040	Yeah.
5118040	5119040	Ah, bummer.
5119040	5120040	All right.
5120040	5121040	Well, then I won't say any more because it's already been debunked.
5121040	5122040	All right.
5122040	5126280	Instead, why don't I mention, um, damn, there was late breaking news before the show.
5126280	5127840	And of course, in the moment, I can't remember.
5127840	5132280	Oh, I was going to say they posted a picture though of their, um, it was, I forget it was
5132280	5133760	one of the people that are working on Arcade 1up.
5133760	5138520	They did post a actual like photo of what the pinball cabinets looked like.
5138600	5139600	Oh, right.
5139600	5140600	They look pretty awesome.
5140600	5141600	Oh, that's awesome.
5141600	5142720	Uh, I remember what it was.
5142720	5146560	I saw floating around Twitter because it was trending on Twitter, apparently a, uh, listing
5146560	5152680	for Zelda Skyward Sword, which was the Nintendo Wii title, not the, like the first one was
5152680	5153680	Twilight Princess.
5153680	5157680	Then Skyward Sword was kind of towards the end of the Wii's life cycle, a listing for
5157680	5160400	that has been spotted for the Switch.
5160400	5166240	So did Nintendo throw together a remaster to carry us through this holiday season, perhaps
5166240	5168160	while some other games are waiting?
5168160	5171120	It remains to be seen, but that is a very interesting development.
5171120	5176040	Uh, if Skyward Sword is going to get a second chance, um, on, well, I don't think it necessarily
5176040	5179160	did bad on the Wii cause the Wii was a huge selling console, but it came out towards the
5179160	5184320	end of the Wii's life when the Wii U started kind of for better for worse showed up.
5184320	5188480	So I think there may be a lot of people that didn't really get to experience Skyward Sword,
5188480	5192760	even though I think that game is only about 10 years old, um, who may, uh, get to experience
5192760	5194440	all over again on Switch.
5194440	5196600	So we'll see what happens with that.
5196600	5197600	Hmm.
5198040	5202000	Um, now, uh, some folks in chat are talking about movie theaters reopening since I was
5202000	5204320	talking about Scott Pilgrim, uh, and so forth.
5204320	5207240	Uh, Phoenix 77 says, uh, theaters reopening.
5207240	5208240	Anyone want to take bets?
5208240	5213920	I'm thinking late 2021 to which Bobby like later this month to which Bobby Blackwell
5213920	5219000	said AMC theaters are opening on August 20th movie tickets are 15 cents.
5219000	5224240	But the question is, yeah, who's willing to go, uh, we'll say, I mean, I guess it depends
5224240	5225240	on where you are.
5225240	5228200	Here's, here's a, what was it?
5228200	5231840	I was watching, um, Phil DeFranco on YouTube.
5231840	5235160	And one of the things that he mentioned was, so for 15 cents a ticket, you can just buy
5235160	5239800	out the whole theater and go buy yourself because there's only 30% capacity.
5239800	5241440	I mean, like how much would that really cost?
5241440	5242440	That's true.
5242440	5243440	That's a good point.
5243440	5244440	Pretty cheap.
5244440	5245440	So just buy all the seats.
5245440	5249960	Well, a lot of times the fine print for those deals say limit two per customer or something
5249960	5250960	like that.
5250960	5253160	So there's usually how they're going to get around it.
5253160	5254160	Yep.
5254160	5255160	Yeah.
5255160	5257000	Drive in chat says drive in movies made a comeback around here.
5257000	5258000	Yeah.
5258000	5259000	Same.
5259000	5260000	And now it's driving events too.
5260000	5262280	I'm hearing about like drive in drag queen shows and things like that.
5262280	5263680	It's very interesting.
5263680	5270400	Just I just crossed my fingers and my toes, the vaccine is out for the holidays and it
5270400	5271400	works.
5271400	5277400	Um, cause I know there was the, the talk about the Russian vaccine, but they haven't really
5277400	5278400	tested it.
5278400	5284120	It sounds like so, but anyway, hopefully they will have a tested vetted, good, solid vaccine.
5284120	5289520	That science says, yes, this will help stop the spread of COVID if people get this, then
5289520	5291160	I will go to the damn movies.
5291160	5292160	Yes.
5292160	5295440	As Joe and Hunter Matt says, until then wear a fucking mask.
5295440	5296440	Yes.
5296440	5297440	Yes.
5297440	5298440	All right.
5298440	5299440	Let's move on.
5299440	5300480	Uh, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
5300480	5303160	Some more things you can play at home while you wait for the movie theaters to open back
5303160	5304160	up.
5304160	5305160	Yes.
5305160	5306800	So this week we got quite a few good things.
5306800	5310260	So Microsoft flight simulator coming out on PC.
5310260	5318260	We have mortal shell on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one battle toads on PC and Xbox one
5318260	5325900	cupid parasites on Nintendo switch, uh, danganronpa to goodbye despair anniversary edition on
5325900	5334140	iOS and Android, uh, Oh, Kana for rhythm across the blue on Nintendo switch and PlayStation
5334140	5342460	four new super Lucky's tale on PlayStation four and Xbox one, uh, PGA tour, two K 21
5342460	5349260	on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four, Xbox one and stadia, uh, samurai Jack battle
5349260	5355100	through time on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one.
5355100	5358100	And I believe that's it.
5358100	5359100	All right.
5359100	5361940	Then let's take a look at Japan and we'll look at the releases there.
5361940	5364820	And uh, since Jamie's not here tonight, I'll ask you to do Europe as well.
5364820	5367940	Uh, going over Japan and looking at the releases there.
5367940	5373220	Cupid parasite comes out on the Nintendo switch and a regular and limited edition on the 20th
5373220	5374220	of this month.
5374220	5375980	I'm trying to figure out what cupid parasite is.
5375980	5380940	Uh, it looks like it's another, uh, manga or anime, um, related title, a story about
5380940	5385600	a cupid who ran away from her family after a fight to become the most successful bridal
5385600	5388580	advisor in the human world.
5388580	5393940	One day the heroin's boss calls her up for a job to find five hopeless guys or parasites
5393940	5399700	in desperate need of fixing their love life and probably their personalities in some cases.
5399700	5401340	Huh?
5401340	5404100	That sounds like a disaster, but all right.
5404100	5410380	Uh, anyway, on the PlayStation four this week in Japan, zombie survival colony builder,
5410380	5411380	there are billions.
5411380	5413720	That is the name of the game.
5413720	5417700	Also rock of ages gets a localized release in Japan.
5417900	5422660	Greed fall also gets a release in Japan this week on the PlayStation four.
5422660	5425940	So let's go to the UK and the UK.
5425940	5431860	We also have Microsoft flight simulator on PC, uh, pathfinder Kingmaker deluxe edition
5431860	5439940	on places for an Xbox one, uh, Willie jet man, Astro monkeys, revenge, sweeper edition.
5439940	5447500	That's on PlayStation four and quite the name, uh, mr driller drill land on Nintendo switch
5447540	5454580	PGA tour, two K 21 on PlayStation four and Xbox one house flipper on PlayStation four
5454580	5461700	Xbox one and Nintendo switch, um, made of sker on Xbox one.
5461700	5465160	Now that's going to be hilarious if that's a survivor horror game, cause it kind of looks
5465160	5474620	like that based on a screenshot made of sker, uh, pinstripe on Nintendo switch, a Kana four
5474620	5478140	rhythms across the blue on Nintendo switch.
5478140	5479140	And that's it.
5479140	5482340	All right, let's get to the mailbag every week.
5482340	5487780	You guys send us emails, participate at orange lounge, radio.com and we read all the emails
5487780	5489780	that aren't spam on the air.
5489780	5493980	So our first email this night comes to us from red entertainment who starts off saying
5493980	5498580	hello peoples and sends us a link to a story we talked about earlier in the show.
5498580	5502340	There's something about Apple's move to pull fortnight from the app store that doesn't
5502340	5503340	make sense to me.
5503700	5506700	And when I dig around a bit, it still doesn't make sense to me.
5506700	5510260	Apple released a statement about you, about their move that I'm not going to repeat here
5510260	5515620	because it's a peak example of utilizing incomprehensible legalese in order to befuddle the masses.
5515620	5519900	If you stare at Apple statement long enough and reread it enough times, you get the vague
5519900	5523660	impression that Epic violates Apple's rules as it related to payment.
5523660	5525900	Okay, what are those rules?
5525900	5529820	And I'm going to assume before this email or this email may have come in before Google
5529820	5533820	was involved in this too, because there was about a 12 hour period where Apple pulled
5533820	5536220	them and then Google pulled them, right?
5536220	5537220	I'm not sure.
5537220	5540220	Yeah, it was pretty, pretty short but it was a few hours.
5540220	5543900	This email seems to be focusing on the Apple side of things, but I do want to clarify that.
5543900	5550380	Anyway, red entertainment continues and actually links to the Apple guidelines and continues.
5550380	5554220	If you read Apple's rules as it's related to payment in section 311, you come across
5554220	5555220	this line.
5555220	5560980	Apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that
5560980	5564660	direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.
5564660	5567740	There, that's the rule Epic appears to have violated.
5567740	5571980	When Epic told users how to purchase in-game currency outside of the Fortnite iOS app and
5571980	5574900	enabled users to do exactly that, they violated Apple's rules.
5574900	5576180	Okay, that's simple.
5576180	5577600	Why didn't Apple just say that?
5577600	5581360	Why did Apple put out a statement that's filled with incomprehensible legal jargon?
5581360	5584800	Why couldn't Apple explain their actions in a way that is easily understandable by
5584800	5585800	humans?
5585800	5587320	Now, I know what you're thinking.
5587320	5592000	I don't have to pay for, insert app here, through Apple in order to use, insert Apple
5592000	5593680	here, on my Apple device.
5593680	5594680	That's right, you don't.
5594680	5597320	A notable example of this is Spotify.
5597320	5599620	Spotify has subscription plans for its users.
5599620	5603720	You cannot sign up for any of those subscription plans inside the Spotify iOS app.
5603720	5607600	Is there a button inside the Spotify that takes you to where you can sign up for a subscription?
5607600	5608600	No.
5608600	5609600	Is there a link that can do the same?
5609600	5610600	No.
5610840	5614480	Does the Spotify tell you what you have to go outside the app to sign up for a subscription?
5614480	5615480	No.
5615480	5618160	What does the Spotify app say about how to sign up for a subscription?
5618160	5620280	You can't upgrade to premium in the app.
5620280	5621280	We know.
5621280	5622280	It's not ideal.
5622280	5623280	And that's it.
5623280	5627920	That's why the Spotify iOS app is currently available in the app store and Fortnite isn't.
5627920	5631040	Spotify doesn't tell you that you have to go outside the app to give it money.
5631040	5632200	Fortnite did.
5632200	5639000	Stay care, stay care, entertainment sent from my iPhone.
5639000	5640560	I thought I'd throw that in there.
5640560	5644880	Anyway, no, I mean, and honestly, yes, you're right.
5644880	5649560	And that is exactly like, and I think I kind of mentioned this before, when we have the
5649560	5653000	example of Twitch, Twitch will sell the bits in the app.
5653000	5656600	They will also sell those same bits on their website, but they don't advertise it in the
5656600	5657600	app.
5657600	5659520	That's what Epic's trying to do.
5659520	5661520	And Epic broke the rules.
5661520	5667120	Now you do make a good point about, or a good, you raise a good question, we'll say, about
5667120	5673920	why doesn't Apple just respond in plain language instead of all this legalese?
5673920	5679920	I don't disagree, but my thought is, well, Epic's now made it a legal issue.
5679920	5684700	So it's being responded to in legalese because anything Apple says at this point can and
5684700	5686960	will be used against them in a court.
5686960	5693760	So I think, that's my thought, why they're responding with legalese.
5693760	5696320	But otherwise, I think you're right.
5696520	5702360	If Epic wasn't trying to do this whole click here for a 20% off sale, it probably wouldn't
5702360	5703800	be an issue.
5703800	5706680	But they did it on purpose because they wanted to make it an issue.
5706680	5708120	They knew what they were doing.
5708120	5712800	Because they want to put their own store on Apple's front.
5712800	5718720	And that's gonna probably be exhibit A, is that, well, they knew what they were doing
5718720	5725960	because look at this prepared video that they made because they wanted to be fancy like
5726960	5728960	I don't know.
5728960	5735480	Epic is not a saint in this whole thing and that is very, very important to note.
5735480	5739960	Anyway, but otherwise, honestly, your email is a lot of the same stuff I've been thinking
5739960	5744080	and I like that you actually, you brought the receipt when it came to what the rule
5744080	5745080	is that they violated.
5745080	5746480	All right, moving on.
5746480	5750640	We have one more email tonight and this one is from Elliot B. who says in this email,
5750640	5755560	hey, OLR, I made another game and I want to share it with you all.
5756160	5762560	It's a music game heavily inspired by Guitaro Man called Chiptari Woman.
5762560	5767040	Since it doesn't seem like there will be an official sequel anytime soon, I decided to
5767040	5768640	make my own.
5768640	5776240	It was for low res jam where the maximum resolution for submissions is 64 by 64.
5776240	5781000	At least they gave participants a leisurely two and a half weeks to finish it.
5781000	5787600	Here's the link, pawprints.itch.io slash Chiptari Woman.
5787600	5792160	I'm actually going to copy paste that into the chat since that's a lot and for the folks
5792160	5798680	that are listening on the podcast, I imagine if you go to that itch.io store, pawprints.itch.io,
5798680	5800640	you'll find it there pretty easy.
5800640	5806040	I've attached a video of the first minute of gameplay too and finally for a change,
5806080	5812000	I was able to grab the video in time and get it loaded here so you can actually see it.
5812000	5820440	So this is Chiptari Woman created by one of our listeners, Elliot B. for the low res jam
5820440	5823920	and I've got to say, this looks awesome.
5823920	5825600	You've done a very good job.
5825600	5827080	I would play this.
5827080	5829320	I would likely pay money for this.
5829320	5834040	I also want to know, did you do the music because that's really good if you did or did
5834040	5844080	you get a friend or did you get a free domain type stuff or I'm curious where the music
5844080	5848840	came from because it's really good and one of the important things that makes a music
5848840	5853000	game is, is the music good?
5853000	5855480	And some comments that are coming in from chat, Elliot, because I don't know if you're
5855480	5857560	here live.
5857560	5858680	This looks cool.
5858680	5860640	Wow, this looks great.
5860640	5862040	This is so cool.
5862040	5865400	I want to fly through a wall and start jamming too because that's what happened with the
5865400	5867840	little guy in the minute long teaser here.
5867840	5870920	So yeah, and that's a 64 by 64 resolution.
5870920	5874360	So kudos to you, Elliot B. like this looks awesome.
5874360	5879120	So I will check this out and all those questions I just asked are probably answered on that
5879120	5881520	store page and I probably just need to go take a look at it.
5881520	5882520	In fact, I'm going to do that now.
5882520	5884000	Can you see the video, Loki?
5884000	5886200	Yeah, it looks pretty cool.
5886200	5889280	Yeah, and this looks cool.
5889320	5894160	So the music is done by, it's by Merkle, M R K L is the artist's name.
5894160	5895160	Thank you.
5895160	5896160	Okay.
5896160	5897200	But yeah, that's awesome.
5897200	5899720	So it is original music though by Merkle.
5899720	5907040	So yeah, it says adorable pixel art and other worldly opponent and it works with game pads
5907040	5908600	if your browser supports it.
5908600	5909920	Oh, look who just popped up in chat.
5909920	5910920	Elliot B's in chat.
5910920	5912440	Kudos to you, my friend.
5912440	5914360	This looks really good.
5914360	5917360	You should like sell this.
5917360	5918360	I don't know.
5918360	5919360	I mean, I don't know.
5919360	5923240	I, you know, maybe you'll want to have it at a resolution that still looks retro, but
5923240	5924840	like plays on phones or something.
5924840	5926840	I don't know.
5926840	5928920	But you're onto something here.
5928920	5930440	That's for sure.
5930440	5936160	So Phoenix 7726 says Merkle like Angela Merkle.
5936160	5945240	No it's M R K L and it's in, they have their own itch.io storefront and mrkl.itch.io.
5945240	5948880	So there you go.
5948880	5951080	Kudos to you, Elliot.
5951080	5953760	You know, we're in the wrong business, Loki.
5953760	5959560	We need to start like a indie promotion business because we've got some great game makers we've
5959560	5964720	come across over the years here at OLR, including YYR, right?
5964720	5967020	And all the wonderful games he's done.
5967020	5973640	And now we have Elliot B. So I want, what other indie developers are lurking out there?
5973640	5974640	Fix your games.
5974640	5975880	Send us emails.
5975880	5976880	Why not?
5976880	5978040	We love indie titles.
5978040	5979600	So that's great.
5979600	5980920	And Elliot B says, thanks guys.
5980920	5982520	The nice comments mean a lot to me.
5982520	5984600	Well, it's, it's, it's well fucking done.
5984600	5985600	Good for you.
5985600	5987960	Uh, I, I, I'm going to play this after the show.
5987960	5988960	I really am.
5988960	5989960	So cool.
5989960	5991120	All right.
5991120	5996560	Chiptari Woman, SSJ 100 Matt says I'm dropping the game link in the discord for the podcast
5996560	5997560	listeners.
5997560	5998760	Ah, very good.
5998760	6000040	A call for play.
6000040	6003680	Elliot B says, how much will the next plug cost?
6003680	6006680	Honestly, all the plugs here are free.
6006680	6013600	Like we don't really make money off OLR, so I'm not gonna, um, you know, I mean, we're
6013600	6018880	not going to plug the same game every single week, but you know, I want to support, Hey,
6018880	6019880	you guys support us.
6019880	6020880	We'll support you.
6020880	6023160	Especially when the games look that good.
6023160	6025720	All right.
6025720	6026720	Let's move on.
6026720	6028840	Uh, that's it for emails tonight.
6028840	6031320	Let's move on to some more stories.
6031320	6033080	Loki, you are up.
6033080	6034080	Yes.
6034080	6041720	Um, so this is once again, a, an example of what not to do if you're making a fan game.
6041720	6049160	So there has been this project, uh, this golden eye double seven remake project that's been
6049160	6054160	several years into development, golden nine 25.
6054160	6061160	And apparently over the last few years, they've posted several, uh, screenshots videos to
6061160	6063600	social media.
6063600	6064880	And what do you think happened?
6064880	6066120	Oh, that's right.
6066120	6067120	Yes.
6067120	6071480	They got a cease and desist from MGM because they didn't have permission to make a fan
6071480	6074880	game for, uh, golden eye double seven.
6074880	6077080	So yep.
6077080	6081520	So unfortunately they can't do a bond game, but they can still do a great game with all
6081520	6084600	of the, um, nineties action shooter aspects.
6084600	6089640	So basically what they're going to do is take what they did with golden eye and change it
6089640	6091680	enough to be not golden.
6091680	6096960	Change all the characters, make tweaks to the artwork and release it as an original
6096960	6097960	title.
6097960	6098960	Ka-blam.
6098960	6099960	Yep.
6099960	6100960	Done.
6100960	6101960	There you go.
6101960	6102960	Yep.
6102960	6103960	Yeah.
6103960	6104960	All right.
6104960	6108640	So, and also lesson learned, don't post about your, um, potentially illegal and, uh, IP
6108640	6113600	infringing title on social media, because sometimes, uh, there's some social media folks,
6113600	6117480	like they scan social media for certain things all the time and double Oh seven might be
6117480	6121520	one of them that they're looking for, especially because there was a new movie we were supposed
6121520	6126160	to have back in April, but you know, it didn't happen.
6126160	6130280	Um, and I don't, they didn't release that double Oh seven movie and I can't even remember
6130280	6135540	the name in the moment, but they didn't release that to, uh, the home services there.
6135540	6138420	Still hoping they can do a theatrical release maybe next year.
6138420	6139420	Huh?
6139420	6140420	At least not yet.
6140420	6141420	Yeah.
6141420	6142420	Let me change your mind.
6142420	6143420	Who knows?
6143420	6150100	Well, if I feel like Disney was almost bullied into it with Mulan, like, and what they did,
6150100	6156700	which I, I still don't love the whole subscribe to Disney plus and pay a premium for Mulan.
6156700	6160180	But I also understand it's probably cheaper than going to the movies and some people will
6160180	6161980	still pay it, especially those with kids.
6161980	6163320	I don't have kids.
6163320	6168460	So my perspective on this is maybe different, um, but, and it'll probably be free on Disney
6168460	6169460	plus eventually.
6169460	6172340	It's just, if I want to see it now, I'm gonna have to pay more money.
6172340	6178940	So anyway, all right, well, let's move on and let's talk about, so this one has to do
6178940	6183300	with hackers and you know, we say around here, hackers going to hack, they're going to find
6183300	6184300	things.
6184300	6190340	Uh, and in this case, hackers have found an official of sorts PlayStation one emulator
6190340	6193260	for the PlayStation four.
6193260	6198180	So in other words, they're trying to pretty much say Sony could offer a PlayStation one
6198180	6204740	emulator if they wanted to, because it was embedded in the medieval remaster that came
6204740	6211240	out in 2019 the remaster of medieval had the original game in it.
6211240	6215940	And so hackers went in, got that emulator and basically, you know, made it so that you
6215940	6220760	can run it on a modified PlayStation four and you can play original PlayStation games
6220760	6223020	at up to a 4k resolution.
6223020	6224840	But of course there's a catch.
6224840	6226780	It doesn't play everything cleanly.
6226780	6232020	Uh, for example, there's some video out there of Konami's original silent Hill game running
6232020	6233020	on it.
6233020	6237660	And some of the, like the sprites have really light boxes around them and some things don't
6237660	6238660	work right.
6238660	6241620	Um, yeah, it's the fog of the end of the Emmy.
6241620	6246180	A lot of the emulators have trouble with Fox, even the official ones from Konami, that's
6246180	6247180	very true.
6247180	6248180	They're parked correctly.
6248180	6249500	That is very true.
6249500	6255800	So, uh, yeah, so anyway, uh, it's also possible that this is used to run, uh, actual classic
6255800	6257780	games available on PlayStation store.
6257780	6262560	I don't remember what PS one games are on the PlayStation store is VIP ribbon PlayStation
6262560	6264880	four or is that, was that on the three?
6264880	6265880	I can't even remember.
6265880	6269860	So long ago now that they finally re-released VIP ribbon in English, but I think that was
6269860	6270860	on the three.
6270860	6271860	Yeah.
6271860	6274580	Uh, Oh, and the Vita, that's why it felt a little newer.
6274580	6280220	Uh, and then of course we all know the PlayStation classic came out in 2018.
6280220	6281380	That was a thing that happened.
6281380	6285120	And of course hackers were on that like that and got all the PlayStation ones and they
6285120	6286820	worked a little better on that one.
6286820	6290620	So, but it's interesting to see that the PlayStation four, you know, obviously they would have
6290620	6296420	to make some tweaks to get the other games to run right, but they could, I don't think
6296420	6300780	many of us are surprised to hear that, especially when PlayStation two games were running very
6300780	6304440	well on the PlayStation four, uh, especially, you know, like when they were selling things
6304440	6309140	like Prapa the Rapa two and things like that, they, they play fine on the PlayStation four,
6309140	6312980	although I'm sure each and every one of those titles, probably they had to test it and make
6312980	6316300	sure it didn't have fog and those types of issues.
6316300	6321380	So, um, but it's, it's still interesting to see how hackers went in and grabbed that emulator.
6321380	6326180	And now, you know, it's like an official emulator of sorts, uh, even though it doesn't emulate
6326180	6327180	everything yet.
6327180	6328180	Perfectly.
6328180	6329180	All right.
6329180	6330180	Let's move on.
6330180	6331180	Loki.
6331180	6332180	All right.
6332180	6336040	Let's talk a little bit about, um, bugs.
6336040	6341420	So Red Dead Online, they, you may remember that there was protests and stuff to try to
6341420	6347060	get updates to grant or wants to grant the Red Dead Online.
6347060	6354940	However, uh, when they implemented the new updates into the game, it broke a lot of stuff.
6354940	6361960	So you had all sorts of crazy stuff like flying horses, raining alligators, um, stuff that
6361960	6366260	you're not normally supposed to see in Red Dead Redemption.
6366260	6372980	Um, I think that's hilarious, but probably doesn't make for a great online experience.
6372980	6382900	Um, so because of that, they ended up walking back that patch 1.21 and yeah, no word on
6382900	6389500	when it's going to be fixed yet, but that's kind of unfortunate that this had to happen.
6389500	6395820	You'd think that they would have, uh, tested some more stuff, but I guess, I guess not.
6395820	6396820	Yeah.
6396820	6401340	Uh, sounds like Red Dead Online keeps having these issues and it's probably, I know it's
6401340	6404980	been irritating you and, and a lot of people out there on the internet, cause it's kind
6404980	6410160	of like, it's just making the game seem cheaper and like this was supposed to be a much bigger
6410160	6414360	and badder game than what it, the online components turned into, right?
6414360	6416160	They better, they better watch out.
6416160	6420160	Any bug here and Todd Howard's going to try to re-release it for the fifth time.
6420160	6422840	So I don't know.
6422840	6425000	Watch out.
6425000	6430080	Speaking of which, uh, bugs and such Bethesda, a quick follow up to something we talked about
6430080	6433640	on last week's show, Quake 2 was free on the launcher this week.
6433640	6439480	And I think it might still be if, uh, uh, Ragenator is still out there listening somewhere.
6439480	6444720	I think Quake 2 is still free on the Bethesda launcher because I know Quake 3, which is
6444720	6449560	like the superior Quake, it takes over, I think tomorrow, uh, and will be free on the
6449560	6451080	Bethesda launcher for a week.
6451080	6455320	So that's exciting, which is, I mean, I already own Quake 3 on Steam cause I think I bought
6455320	6458520	it for like five bucks, probably like 10 years ago on Steam.
6458520	6461600	Uh, but Quake 3 really is like the best Quake.
6461600	6463560	It's a lot, that's a really fun PVP as well.
6463560	6467240	So just a quick follow up tips since we were talking about buggy games that made me remember,
6467240	6468740	Oh yeah, Bethesda.
6468740	6471340	So all right.
6471340	6475900	As as does have, did you know though, I didn't know this, um, the Bethesda launcher since
6475900	6480660	I've never really used it before and this was, ain't nothing for free, right?
6480660	6482440	This is exactly what Bethesda wanted.
6482440	6485780	I'm going to go in and look around the launcher and see what else is there.
6485780	6493020	I didn't realize they put out like official Skyrim mod making tools, uh, as well as Fallout
6493020	6495700	4 that like you can design your own quests and stuff.
6495700	6498380	Yeah, that was a long time ago.
6498380	6504220	So they, I never realized it was the same tool that they use to make quests that they
6504220	6506920	put out, which I thought was interesting.
6506920	6511420	So they, they did that in the sense that that was back when they had those enhancements
6511420	6514980	that they were adding to the game, the paid mods basically.
6514980	6520980	So the thing was, Oh yeah, you can release your mods through the, um, Bethesda storefront
6520980	6522100	or whatever.
6522100	6524640	And then also you could, um, sell them.
6524640	6528280	I think you could sell them as well through there as well.
6528280	6534800	Um, but I know then they turn to sell a lot of those mods as well through the storefront.
6534800	6539600	And that's how you get like, you know, where skin in the game costs like 20 bucks.
6539600	6540600	It's ridiculous.
6540600	6545680	Um, but yeah, I know that stuff's available, but I, I'm sure that there's other tool sets
6545680	6550560	out there that aren't official that worked just as well because there was lots of bots
6550560	6552320	before that whole thing came out.
6552320	6554320	So they had to do it somehow.
6555000	6561000	All right, well moving on, uh, Twitch Prime is no more and that's because it's been rebranded.
6561000	6563860	So Twitch Prime is now Prime Gaming.
6563860	6568600	And that happened earlier this week where, uh, Amazon who of course is over Twitch, uh,
6568600	6574100	rebranded all of the perks that you're used to getting with Twitch Prime under Prime Gaming.
6574100	6579520	This is probably to come in line with services like Prime Video, Prime Reading and Prime
6579520	6580520	Gaming.
6580520	6582320	Otherwise they haven't really made a lot of changes to it.
6582320	6588320	You still get your free subscription to a channel, which I would be a bad broadcaster
6588320	6592560	if I didn't try to encourage you to use that free one right here at VOG Network where you
6592560	6596760	get access to our video archives to watch on demand whenever you want.
6596760	6601320	If you can't be here on Sunday night, our subscribers, whether it's through the free
6601320	6604160	Prime Gaming subscription or through a $5 sub.
6604160	6608640	And I think the subs might actually be, I saw that subs were discounted for first timers.
6608640	6612440	They might be running a free promotion right now, or not free, but like a promotion of
6612440	6613440	sorts right now.
6613440	6616080	So I look into that cause I was checking that out for the show.
6616080	6618680	But anyway, uh, you get access to the full video archives.
6618680	6624360	Of course the podcast, the audio still free as it's been for 18 years.
6624360	6630000	We did not charge for anything that we, um, we're always giving away for free that is
6630000	6631600	staying free.
6631600	6636820	So um, anyway, yeah, so Prime Gaming is, is it now, um, that's the one that gets you some
6636820	6640340	game perks as well and some, uh, stuff in games.
6640340	6645980	Um, I can't say we're all going to be quick to remember this rebranding and I'm probably
6645980	6650620	still going to say Twitch Prime, your Twitch Prime account and all that, uh, because I've
6650620	6654900	just, you say one thing for so many years, it takes a little while to get used to it.
6654900	6657860	I'm sure there'll be a lot of broadcasters in the same boat.
6657860	6661400	Um, but that's, uh, that's just part of the switch there.
6661400	6662400	You know what we mean?
6662400	6663400	You know?
6663400	6664400	Exactly.
6664400	6665400	You know what we mean?
6665400	6669080	Jeff says, yeah, there's a promotion, I think, and streamers get more for Prime subs.
6669080	6670680	Oh, is that true?
6670680	6674640	Well then you should really consider using that one.
6674640	6675640	I have to try.
6675640	6680220	I'm a bad broadcaster if I know, but you know what, Hey, if you don't even give us a dime,
6680220	6681220	that is okay too.
6681220	6682220	I understand.
6682220	6687140	Uh, especially in these times, money is hard to come by, but, uh, we do use money to make
6687140	6690420	improvements to the show and there'll be more coming later on.
6690420	6691420	So all right.
6691420	6692420	Yeah.
6693420	6697780	How many times did we say all games radio by accident after moving to vog or how many
6697780	6703960	times did I say, and you can join our chat at a game surge or whatever, or a live dot
6703960	6704960	vog network.com.
6704960	6712080	I still say that just out of habit, mail bag at orange, which is the old email.
6712080	6713080	Don't use it.
6713080	6714720	It'll bounce participate at orange laundry.
6714720	6717640	Do.com is the place to send those emails.
6717640	6718640	All right.
6718760	6722180	Let's move on some more things before we get to our listener round table.
6722180	6723180	Loki.
6723180	6724180	Yes.
6724180	6729420	So, you know, it seems like there's so many art, little mini arcade cabinets coming out.
6729420	6731200	I can't keep track of all of them.
6731200	6735160	Well now there's another, uh, Neo Geo arcade home machine.
6735160	6740500	So this is not quite the super mini one that they had, but this is more of like your arcade
6740500	6742380	one up bar top type cabinets.
6743040	6745200	So it's going to run $500.
6745200	6750080	However, unlike you would get with say an arcade one up cabinet, there's going to be
6750080	6753740	a few more games in there, 50 games total.
6753740	6761480	So all your favorites from the SNK and the Neo Geo.
6761480	6765360	And they also have a stand you can get as well.
6765360	6769660	That kind of turns into an upright cabinet, although it looks kind of strange, but still
6769660	6776480	pretty slick looking, um, and the stand itself as an extra 50 bucks, that's not bad.
6776480	6777480	Yeah.
6777480	6779340	I have to say I'm kind of interested.
6779340	6783660	One person that's not interested in our chat room, Bobby Black Wolf, who says I was excited
6783660	6787240	about this until I saw it did not have bust to move.
6787240	6789360	That was literally the only game I was interested in.
6789360	6795060	Um, yeah, I love that game, but there's other games, uh, that, that SNK did that I'd be
6795060	6796060	okay with.
6796060	6801400	So, um, it does sound very interesting to me, uh, as Joe and her mat says, I like this
6801400	6806720	Neo Geo cab act F says, I really love the Neo Geo cab, uh, and SJ one on a mat says
6806720	6809460	it's an SNK fighting game gamer's dream.
6809460	6813620	You know, they had that other little Neo Geo cab not that long ago.
6813620	6817800	Um, and so it's interesting that they're kind of doing another one that's just bigger and
6817800	6820500	a little more inspired by the arcade one up stuff.
6820500	6825780	As long as I could put it into like a four game mode or whatever that has it cycle through
6825780	6833280	those like it used to with the arcade cabinet that used to be in the, uh, like, uh, grocery
6833280	6840660	store I used to go to needs to have like baseball stars, magician, Lord, and I want to say metal
6840660	6842140	slug in there.
6842140	6843820	Probably metal slug.
6843820	6846860	I think it was also like art of fatal fury or something in there.
6846860	6848920	I also, I can't think of the game in the moment.
6848920	6850020	There was another puzzle game.
6850020	6852740	So you may be angry about bust to move, not being there.
6852740	6853740	Puzzle de Pawn.
6853740	6854740	I love that.
6854780	6857980	Is that a puzzle de Pawn where you pull the balls down and you throw the balls back up
6857980	6862820	in the matching colors that's puzzled upon, uh, puzzle de Pawn is kind of like a bust
6862820	6866180	to move sort of thing, but that was the one that I used to play all the time.
6866180	6869700	There's one where you, I can't remember the name in the moment you pull the balls down
6869700	6873020	and then you go run over to the column with the matching ones and throw them back up.
6873020	6875220	And I can't remember the name of it, but that was an SNK one too.
6875220	6876220	I don't know.
6876220	6879100	I don't know what that one was, but yeah, the one I used to play that was like a bust
6879100	6881500	to move with puzzle de Pawn.
6881500	6882500	Okay.
6882740	6884540	And is that on the cab?
6884540	6886740	No, there's not very many.
6886740	6887740	Thank you.
6887740	6889140	Dark to see a magical drop.
6889140	6890140	That's it.
6890140	6891140	Thank you.
6891140	6892140	Yeah.
6892140	6893140	Yeah.
6893140	6895700	It's mostly, it looks like it's mostly fighting games, metal slug, and they have a couple
6895700	6897020	of like sports games on there.
6897020	6902940	So baseball stars, football frenzy, top player or top players, golf and super sidekicks.
6902940	6907900	Um, but the most, most of it is looks like just fighting.
6907900	6911300	In fact, I'd say 90% of it is fighting games.
6911300	6912300	Kind of disappointing.
6912300	6916340	I mean, I get it, but like, I would hope that there's more of a variety of stuff.
6916340	6919540	Maybe because maybe a lot of that's third party.
6919540	6920660	I don't know.
6920660	6927100	I'm just used to my, my, was it not Pandora's box, but I have a not quite legit multi-cart
6927100	6928460	that now Bobby owns.
6928460	6932900	Uh, they had like a ton of like games on the puzzle de Pawn was one I did play on there.
6932900	6935260	One of the first games I played on my arcade cabinet.
6935260	6936260	Nice.
6936260	6937260	All right.
6937260	6938260	One more story for you guys.
6938260	6944180	And it's about, uh, an event for next year already making changes, uh, because of, you
6944180	6946740	know, potentially COVID and related things.
6946740	6951860	And it's the game developers conference or GDC number one, they've pushed it way back.
6951860	6957060	So GDC next year is going to be in July, July 19th through 23rd.
6957060	6958660	That's after E3.
6958660	6960260	That's not where they're usually at.
6960260	6963360	GDC was usually a March thing, if I remember right.
6963360	6965620	So they're pushing it way back for next year.
6965620	6970640	So they must really be banking on, you know, there's going to be a vaccine or something,
6970640	6974900	but even with all that, they're saying it's going to be a scaled down edition of the live
6974900	6975900	show.
6975900	6978900	They will have it at the Moscone center in San Francisco where they usually have it,
6978900	6981780	but there will also be an online showcase.
6981780	6983380	So it's going to be a little bit of a hybrid event.
6983380	6988740	Uh, there's going to be publishers and developers showing things online as well as face to face.
6988740	6993140	Um, there's no official comment that this is because of COVID.
6993140	6996020	Um, that's kind of what's being inferred.
6996020	6999460	People are assuming that, you know, there might still be issues related to COVID, or
6999460	7003100	maybe we just won't be ready for the gigantic crowds at that point, you know, because it's
7003100	7006220	going to take time to get a lot of people vaccinated and then there's going to be people
7006220	7009980	that aren't going to get vaccinated because they're going to be like, oh, it's inserting
7009980	7013940	a microchip in my brain and all this stuff, whatever, whatever.
7013940	7014940	Anyway.
7014940	7020060	So, um, you know, there's, it's going to take a little time probably, you know, these huge
7020060	7022540	events are going to be the last thing to come back.
7022540	7027180	So I can see why they're kind of, you know, doing a little bit of both.
7027180	7031980	Um, so, and, and also, it also makes sense that if things were to happen and things were
7031980	7035940	still in a bad place, I mean, heaven forbid, but if things were still in a bad place in
7035940	7040860	July of next year, they would have the digital thing to fall back on.
7040860	7042340	So there's that too.
7042340	7047980	Uh, Pixel Pacas points out this year's GDC was a few weeks ago fully online.
7047980	7052180	The system worked pretty well, but wasn't great for networking in my opinion, that comment
7052220	7054700	from our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
7054700	7056980	I didn't realize they even finally had it online.
7056980	7060520	A lot of these digital events aren't promoting very well, but then again, I'm also not the
7060520	7062020	audience for GDC.
7062020	7063780	Pixel Pacas is the audience for GDC.
7063780	7064780	I'm not.
7064780	7069940	So, uh, that might be why so, um, but, uh, it's interesting a few weeks ago would be
7069940	7072100	around the same timeframe end of July.
7072100	7080980	So there is that, um, let's see, um, there will still be master classes that GDC is going
7080980	7085780	to do virtually for the rest of 2020, uh, they are courses that are intended to tutor
7085780	7090660	devs on various aspects of game design, and there'll be more info on that, uh, over the
7090660	7091660	coming weeks.
7091660	7099780	So again, GDC next year, July 19th through the 23rd, hopefully in person and online,
7099780	7101980	we're going to cross our fingers and our toes.
7101980	7103800	I can't imagine another year of this.
7103800	7108900	I think that people are, I mean, it's already happening where people are like, I can't do
7108900	7110260	this quarantine thing anymore.
7110260	7115620	I'm just going to let go and let God and, uh, who cares who I put at risk and I that's
7115620	7117580	only going to get worse the longer this goes on.
7117580	7122420	So fingers and toes crossed that they, they have a miracle on the vaccine front.
7122420	7123420	That's for sure.
7123420	7124420	All right.
7124420	7128300	Well, at this point, we're going to open up the chat for any topics that we might've missed
7128300	7129300	throughout the show.
7129300	7133620	I know we're a little, uh, early tonight, but that also happens, uh, when we're down
7133620	7135500	a host and dark soccer is not here tonight.
7135500	7139420	Um, I will in the meantime, look to Loki to see if we have any last minute stories tonight,
7139420	7142780	but if you have something you want to ask or have us talk about, please go to our chat
7142780	7145660	over twitch.tv slash a VOG network.
7145660	7148060	Um, okay.
7148060	7149060	So let's see.
7149060	7150060	Yeah.
7150060	7155500	We've got, there's a techno attached in a drum and fun, apparently e-sports turn mode,
7155500	7160060	uh, which is going to be launching on August 19th.
7160060	7161060	So that's cool.
7161060	7163740	Is that the PS or PS four version?
7163740	7169340	Uh, I don't know if that is, or it sounds like it's for the switch.
7169340	7171380	Oh, okay.
7171380	7174940	So I'm assuming in Japan, but yeah, that's pretty cool that they have like an e-sports
7174940	7176940	mode to that.
7176940	7183580	Um, let's see what else we got.
7183580	7186020	There is a, they're making a new GI Joe game.
7186020	7192460	So GI Joe operation blackout it's coming out on the PlayStation four X-Box one and switch
7192460	7193460	that's out of nowhere.
7193460	7197880	Is that going to be based off of the, the game or hopefully God, I hope they're not
7197880	7202320	making another movie that looks not great.
7202320	7208840	Can I get a remake of like an NES or super NES game or arcade game?
7208840	7210320	I think that'd be better.
7210320	7211320	Wow.
7211320	7215600	This looks generic is hell actually, you know what it reminds me of?
7215600	7218360	It reminds me of a flood, a far cry blood dragon.
7218360	7221320	Cause it's all neon the hell out.
7221320	7223520	Uh, that's what it really looks like.
7223520	7227840	That's a game we need a sequel to, uh, dark to see you in our chat over twitch.tv.
7227840	7232960	Slash vog network says I picked up cosmic star heroin on the switch.
7232960	7234880	It was on sale for super cheap.
7234880	7238840	It feels heavily inspired by the square Enix classic chrono trigger.
7238840	7240400	I highly recommend it.
7240400	7242360	Uh, quest buster says, LOL.
7242360	7244680	I saw the trailer for the GI Joe game.
7244680	7250400	It just came out of nowhere and isn't based on anything upcoming as far as I know.
7250400	7253240	They just want to sell more toys.
7253240	7260560	So I, I, uh, forwarded my wife some videos of, um, there's a, one of the, a couple like
7260560	7268760	a YouTuber that does fake animal crossing quality of life update announcement videos.
7268760	7269760	Oh yeah.
7269760	7270760	I saw it.
7270760	7271760	Yeah.
7271760	7272760	Anger is the hell out of me.
7272760	7274160	Cause I'm like, why don't they have that?
7274160	7275160	Oh yeah.
7275160	7280800	Um, there's so much like just watching her play it like, I don't know what the hell they're
7280800	7283200	thinking sometimes with just the way to design it.
7283200	7287080	So it's like some of the issues, like, especially like with, you know, digging a hole or something
7287080	7291000	like that and, you know, trying to line up the right spot in it, that's been a problem
7291000	7293040	for like since the beginning.
7293040	7294920	And why hasn't that been fixed?
7294920	7298760	Like some of the stuff you don't really think about because like, Oh, animal, look at all
7298760	7302080	the stuff that they added, but it's like, Oh my God, there's so much that could be improved
7302080	7303080	with that.
7303080	7305960	There's a great, I think it's a tick talk or something like that, that Alan showed me.
7305960	7308360	And I think he posted it on your wife's page this way too.
7308360	7309360	I don't have Facebook anymore.
7309360	7312240	So no, but I think he posted it on your wife's page.
7312240	7316480	It was this guy and he like is like trying to aim the shovel and then he goes and knocks
7316480	7317480	over the table.
7317480	7318480	I did that.
7318480	7319480	Yeah.
7319480	7320480	That's Gus Johnson.
7320480	7321480	So yeah.
7321480	7322480	Okay.
7322480	7323480	Really funny.
7323480	7324480	A YouTuber.
7324480	7325480	But yeah, he did.
7325480	7327280	He does these little short videos, but that was one day I posted on her wall.
7327280	7328280	Um, okay.
7328280	7329280	Okay.
7329280	7330280	But yeah, that's hilarious.
7330280	7335040	And it perfectly illustrates animal crossing sometimes just because some of the things
7335040	7339880	we're trying to do, like she's trying to build a staircase between, um, the two of
7339880	7341420	the buildings in the game.
7341420	7344120	And for whatever reason, it just would not let her do it.
7344120	7348300	It's like, sorry, there's not enough space to, you know, I don't know, this, this cliff
7348300	7351160	doesn't look even enough where we're going to put stairs here.
7351160	7353040	And it's like, right there, right there.
7353040	7355480	It's like, why won't you work?
7355480	7360960	Uh, um, Bobby in chat says they don't, Bobby and chat says they don't consider it broken.
7360960	7362000	That's why they haven't fixed it.
7363000	7367320	Animal crossing has sold almost more than any other switch game at this point.
7367320	7369680	So what, what's their motivation to fix it.
7369680	7373400	Although we do know there is a, there's a fall update coming.
7373400	7376200	Maybe some things will be addressed, but I'm not going to hold my breath.
7376200	7379280	But just some quality of life stuff like in the stuff that was in those views wasn't like
7379280	7380600	ridiculous things.
7380600	7384580	It was like, Hey, you know why say you want to craft two of something.
7384580	7390880	You can select the quantity or like, how about, you know, um, the ability to see your storage
7390880	7397760	where you're aiming, you know, just a crafting from your storage, like not ridiculous things,
7397760	7402180	like things that I would see without having any knowledge of how they construct that game
7402180	7404160	that shouldn't be too hard to implement.
7404160	7407320	Like I get it that you're not going to be able to do everything that everybody wants,
7407320	7411840	but like some of this stuff is an unreasonable and when make things a little bit better.
7411840	7414100	Let me, let me ask this related question.
7414100	7416320	So obviously your wife is still playing animal crossing.
7416320	7418200	Are you.
7418200	7424320	I did the other day just to, um, cause I have, you know, the online access.
7424320	7426480	So I did the download some designs.
7426480	7429920	Unfortunately, my youngest son was the one that played the game first.
7429920	7434960	So he is running the town and also I had to play the other day because he made my birthday
7434960	7437320	August 9th for some reason.
7437320	7443040	So, um, so I had to do my birthday stuff.
7443040	7444600	He got the nine, right?
7444600	7445600	Kinda.
7446600	7449560	It's just the month, sorta, sorta close.
7449560	7454320	So I had to, I had to do the, um, birthday stuff, you know, for that.
7454320	7457880	Um, but yeah, no, it isn't night.
7457880	7458880	I don't know.
7458880	7459880	I did it, uh, today.
7459880	7463780	Maybe when she just time traveling, I don't remember, but yeah, so I had to do the birthday
7463780	7467120	stuff early and, um, yeah.
7467120	7470060	And then the download, the patterns off the internet.
7470060	7474080	So we were downloading some patterns so she can trick it out and stuff.
7474080	7478080	But yeah, it's, I don't really play it.
7478080	7483640	Um, Bobby is, is putting several comments in chat, essentially, uh, summarizing, uh,
7483640	7489200	if you haven't seen the code is coded, then you don't know if it's easy or not to fix.
7489200	7495440	Um, and you know, maybe, maybe Nintendo, I think the thing is people are spoiled, you
7495440	7497800	know, and we say this a lot.
7497800	7499840	Perception is everything, right?
7499840	7502840	So what you're saying, those are probably the facts.
7502840	7508740	You know, I, the fact they likely are the facts, but perception is everything.
7508740	7513440	And when other games do these quality of life things they do online in a different way or
7513440	7516880	they do the regular updates, they do such and such thing.
7516880	7520520	It kind of, that's why people go, well, why can't Nintendo just do it this way?
7520520	7521920	Because other companies are doing it.
7521920	7525760	And I'm not saying, I'm not saying I disagree with what you're saying, but it's just like
7525760	7530040	that perception is very, very big is that other game companies do make it look easy
7530040	7535380	sometimes and probably because they do see the benefit in putting the resources into
7535380	7536380	it.
7536380	7540660	I, but again, I don't think everything on the wishlist, you know, there are some things
7540660	7544100	in there where even I'm like, well, that's going to be really hard for them to go back
7544100	7550040	and do, but I think there's a, there's a few things in there that again, other games made
7550040	7553520	it look easy, but I guess we don't really know cause we can't see Nintendo's code.
7553520	7558160	Um, just like seeing, yeah, just seeing where you're aiming, obviously the game is doing
7558160	7563840	some sort of rate cast calculation for where you're aiming your shovel or whatever it is,
7563840	7566520	item trying to put it down and stuff like that.
7566520	7571360	And I mean, obviously it's figuring out which space it's going in because it already knows
7571360	7575920	when you put it down or do it, you know, dig or whatever, just show that display it.
7575920	7580080	I mean, I don't see why that would be a problem, but I get it.
7580080	7581080	I mean, that's fine.
7581080	7582080	Whatever they're going to do.
7582080	7587680	They're the aim selling well, so I guess maybe they're not motivated to improve it more like
7587680	7588680	that.
7588680	7589680	We'll see what they come up with.
7589680	7594160	Or we'll see what the fall update has because they, you know, there are still changes coming
7594160	7598320	and everything that we've gotten so far has been more of like a small event.
7598320	7601320	Like they've been like, they've been patching in a holiday or patching this thing, but this
7601320	7603480	fall event, they're kind of teasing us a bigger thing.
7603480	7606520	So we might, I mean, I don't want to set false expectation, I'm not going to put the bar
7606520	7611960	too high, but we might get some of it in the fall update, maybe the low hanging fruit,
7611960	7614680	so to speak of this code that we can't see.
7614680	7615680	All right.
7616680	7621440	SG100Matt says Def Jam has been teasing a new or remake of Def Jam Vendetta or Fight
7621440	7622440	for New York.
7622440	7625460	They tweeted out the other day that if they hit 1 million on their Twitter, they will
7625460	7628920	have a special announcement with a picture of Vendetta.
7628920	7629920	Hmm.
7629920	7630920	Interesting.
7630920	7634560	Pissalpaca says, did they ever post the follow up because they've had a million followers
7634560	7635560	for days.
7635560	7639320	Well, we're we're waiting.
7639320	7640640	Probably check back Monday.
7640640	7642200	It is the weekend after all.
7642720	7643720	All right.
7643720	7645160	Any other last minute stories, Logie?
7645160	7646800	No, that's all I had.
7646800	7647800	All right.
7647800	7649720	Then I think we'll go ahead and wrap things up for the night.
7649720	7653960	Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show, whether you were here live or you were
7653960	7655240	on our podcast.
7655240	7658160	We really appreciate you participating with our show.
7658160	7660640	Send us an email, say hello to us that way.
7660640	7662680	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7662680	7667400	We're also on social media, on Twitter over at OLR.
7667400	7670560	And yeah, we'll be back in seven days to do this all over again.
7670560	7673360	If you wouldn't mind helping us spread the word, we are the show where every gamer has
7673360	7674360	a voice.
7674360	7677200	But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, we're missing that.
7677200	7679960	So tell a friend or two about the show, help us spread the word.
7679960	7683760	An auto host on Twitch goes a real long way.
7683760	7688460	A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this podcast.
7688460	7689660	Those go a long way as well.
7689660	7692960	We really appreciate those word of mouth things.
7692960	7695920	That all being said, let's wrap up and get final thoughts.
7695920	7699040	Dark Sakura will be here next week.
7699040	7705320	We'll see you guys then with Jamie and whatever should happen in the industry this week.
7705320	7708260	Maybe we'll get some big announcements about these consoles, who knows?
7708260	7711480	Or maybe we'll have more reasons to come back and say, you know what, fuck you and fuck
7711480	7712480	you and fuck you.
7712480	7713760	We'll see what happens.
7713760	7716440	Loki, your final thought tonight?
7716440	7723160	I'm going to keep working on making something or learning more stuff.
7723160	7724160	I don't know.
7724160	7726200	But yeah, I'm going to keep working on stuff.
7726200	7731440	Hopefully I made something that technically is a game, but technically it's such a short
7731440	7735640	following a tutorial that I don't really count that.
7735640	7739480	Well it's something, you got to start somewhere.
7739480	7741000	It's one little step.
7741000	7742000	Yay.
7742000	7743000	All right.
7743000	7744000	Cool.
7744000	7745240	All right.
7745240	7746240	My final thought.
7746240	7747240	I don't have a lot.
7747240	7751400	You know, good luck to Bobby with Summer Games done quick and looking forward to Virtual
7751400	7753760	Dragon Con as well.
7753760	7758900	And yeah, let's just keep wearing our masks and social distance and do everything we can
7758900	7764680	to try to lessen the spread of COVID so we can get back to real life and events like
7764680	7771200	GDC and all the other things we miss where 2020 has just kind of ruined all of that.
7771200	7776680	And also stay cool and stay hydrated, especially those of you in California.
7776680	7778480	This heat wave is going to get worse.
7778480	7780120	Tuesday is going to be real bad.
7780120	7781720	The number keeps going up and down.
7781720	7786000	It was at 114 at one point and I was like, what the fuck?
7786000	7787200	But I think it's down to like one or nine.
7787200	7790920	I think this cloud and the rains and all this stuff that's happened, maybe put it down.
7790920	7793160	But yeah, that's yikes.
7793160	7795520	So anyway, stay hydrated.
7795520	7798480	Because seriously, I was out at like eight in the morning.
7798480	7800200	I was doing my cemetery portal scanning.
7800200	7805960	I talked about a couple of weeks ago on the show and by like 930 I was done and I was
7805960	7809840	already feeling a little bit like, why am I just so exhausted?
7809840	7811640	I had to drink a lot of water.
7811640	7815880	So yeah, I've been trying to be real good about my walking, but I'm going to take a
7815880	7816880	break for a few days.
7816880	7817880	I have to.
7817880	7819120	It's just too damn hot.
7819120	7821520	So stay inside, play some video games.
7821520	7822800	That'll be fun too.
7822800	7824440	So we will see you next week, everybody.
7824440	7825440	Good night.
