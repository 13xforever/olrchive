0	21000	What do you do when multiple studios creating new and remastered content for a single IP starts running dry? You add a level of recursion! Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War sets the stage for a future Call of Duty Ultimate World of Warfare 5 Zombie Aliens
21000	27000	I just bought 33 titles and one remaster in name in less than two decades is astounding and might give Mario a run for his money.
27000	32000	At least one of your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki has deep knowledge of one of the Call of Duty titles.
32000	33000	It's Loki by the way.
33000	38000	And they'll talk about this game and the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
38000	48000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
48000	58000	It is Orange Lounge Radio back again tonight with episode number 833 for this August the 23rd of 2020.
58000	62000	Joining me tonight via the magic of Discord.
62000	66000	We used to love doing this show in the same room as we did for many, many years.
66000	70000	But be that as may with the state of the world we're taping over Discord.
70000	74000	So joining me on Discord down below there is Techmaster Loki.
74000	76000	Hi Techmaster Loki, how are you?
76000	77000	Hello.
77000	78000	Good to see you.
78000	79000	Pretty good.
79000	80000	Alright.
80000	81000	Yeah.
81000	82000	Good, good.
82000	84000	And you're playing the Secret of Monkey Island or somebody else's?
84000	86000	I'm not playing anything yet.
86000	89000	It's a long play of Secret of Monkey Island.
89000	90000	It's a good choice.
90000	91000	It's a good choice for your backdrop tonight.
91000	92000	Appreciate that.
92000	93000	Alright.
93000	97000	And a big welcome back tonight to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers up there.
97000	98000	Sorry.
98000	99000	I'm Vegeta tonight.
99000	101000	I'm Space Dad.
101000	102000	I'm kidding.
102000	104000	Looking fabulous with your wig as always.
104000	106000	Yeah I don't know if I like this one.
106000	108000	It needs some zhuzh.
108000	111000	This is fresh out of the box Cher style he may cut.
111000	112000	You know.
112000	116000	It's got a little bit of that Dog on Rope a Bear vibe to it with the whole black and white.
116000	117000	Oh Monokuma.
117000	118000	Actually it's pink and white.
118000	119000	It's pink and black.
119000	124000	It looks a little you know because your camera is a little you know older so I think it looks
124000	125000	a little more like white.
125000	126000	It's actually not older.
126000	127000	It's fucking cheaper.
127000	128000	Oh okay.
128000	129000	Well you said it.
129000	130000	I didn't.
130000	131000	I'll admit it.
131000	132000	Thanks Wish.
132000	134000	Thanks for my five dollar webcam yo.
134000	135000	Hey you know what?
135000	140000	Sometimes you have to make cheap things work and on a somewhat related note this isn't
140000	147000	about video games but Dark Sakura and I you guys know we love to talk about drag and actually
147000	154000	I would argue in some ways video games can be a form of drag especially like MMOs and
154000	156000	role play and flesh character.
156000	157000	It's all drag.
157000	161000	Anyway we're all born naked in the rest of this drag right.
161000	162000	Exactly.
162000	163000	But I would be remiss not to.
163000	164000	And I am.
164000	165000	I do drag.
165000	166000	You do.
166000	167000	You do.
167000	168000	As a nun.
168000	169000	I did.
169000	172000	I did once for a stage play one time.
172000	176000	But anyway I would be on a serious note I would be remiss not to say anything about
176000	181000	the passing of Chichi Devane this week and I wouldn't expect all of our listeners recognize
181000	182000	that name.
182000	187000	But anyway anybody that has a familiarity with RuPaul's Drag Race or heck the pageant
187000	192000	scene in the southern drag scene most certainly knows the Louisiana queen of the bayou Chichi
192000	200000	Devane who unfortunately left this left this earth this week at the age of 34.
200000	203000	Not COVID and I feel weird I have to say that.
203000	207000	It was pneumonia resulting from previous kidney failure.
207000	213000	Yeah it was pneumonia due to her prior existing health conditions but obviously 34 is way
213000	215000	too young of an age but you know.
215000	216000	It really is.
216000	220000	I cracked a little line there about sometimes you have to make cheap things work and I think
220000	224000	that's something that you know that was a presence that Chichi brought to the show was
224000	225000	that.
225000	227000	She came out in garbage bags both times.
227000	231000	She didn't have a huge budget but she made it work right.
231000	235000	So I think that was a great value that we could take from somebody like that.
235000	244000	And I will go on record that her lip sync in the first season was my second favorite
244000	246000	ever Drag Race lip sync.
246000	250000	My first favorite being the Raja and Jujubee.
250000	251000	Right.
251000	253000	When they did me anything on my own and started crying.
253000	255000	Raven and Jujubee.
255000	257000	That was Raven sorry.
257000	263000	I always think Raven and Raja so you know.
263000	268000	But yeah I just I just wanted to tip my hat and acknowledge that I mean it's just a horrible
268000	274000	loss for that community and you know just send our well wishes to her family and her
274000	279000	friends and you know one of the big lines that we get from Drag Race is that you know
279000	283000	we get to choose our family and so there are many many many people I'm sure Chichi had
283000	289000	no shortage of brothers and sisters and cousins and and so forth so I'm sure a lot of
289000	292000	people really really feeling a hole in their heart this week so.
292000	297000	Oh and on top of that for me I mean she's from Shreveport Louisiana where I would spend
297000	303000	I mean I've been to shout out to Coast Con and Shreveport you know I would go to Coast
303000	312000	Con a few times when I was in my con circuit in Alabama and it was just really nice
312000	318000	seeing someone kind of from my edge of the swamp and I like to say and I was really
318000	320000	you know I was rooting for her all season.
320000	321000	Yeah I know.
321000	327000	You know she's up there in my top tier of Queens she was just so much fun and it felt
327000	332000	really nice to see you know a deep south queen you know that wasn't from Texas.
332000	336000	And admittedly if you were to go back and listen to older episodes of reading is fundamental
336000	340000	which was a show I did about that show I was a little harder on her.
340000	346000	But you know I just she was slaying on my faves in those lip syncs so maybe I was just
346000	347000	a little bit bitter I don't know.
347000	350000	That upside down lip sync.
350000	356000	Yeah yeah but you can also recognize a TV show is very very different from a person
356000	361000	and just as a person certainly whatever your thoughts about that little contest that's
361000	366000	televised just just a really wonderful sweet person that was just genuine and in it for
366000	368000	all the right reasons it's great.
368000	373000	Yeah she was she was really really I mean she was great to meet in person so she was
373000	375000	she was a delight.
375000	377000	All right rest in rest in power my friend.
377000	381000	All right let's move on though we do want to get into talking about what is going on
381000	388000	with video games and that industry that we love to to take our minds off of all the horrors
388000	395000	of the real world and all of these these horrible passings before their time and fires
395000	400000	burning nearby which by the way OLR is nowhere near that we're only feeling the effects of
400000	404000	the smoke which is but I mean we're all staying indoors anyway so although I heard we did
404000	410000	have a brush fire not far from my house oh no right off of right out well I'll go ahead
410000	414000	and say it because nobody except from here is going to know where it is but off of Franklin
414000	422000	oh yeah apparently a grass fire and that's what shot out into my area and your area to
422000	423000	make it worse.
423000	426000	That's where my uncle lives.
426000	428000	I hope everything is OK.
428000	430000	I'm just finding that out now.
430000	433000	So I will have to investigate that.
433000	436000	So yeah because that's the eye and that's all very rural out there.
436000	439000	That's like hood Franklin Road right because I always joked my uncle was from the hood
439000	443000	because you go one way off that street to go to hood and what there is literally a town
443000	445000	called Hood and another way to go to Franklin.
445000	446000	Wow.
446000	452000	OK well and but I mean I would say probably one of the nicer areas off of Franklin over
452000	454000	in Elk Grove.
454000	457000	So you're actually in like populated area.
457000	458000	Yeah.
458000	460000	Not in the countryside Elk Grove.
460000	463000	But that's a country but the countryside is where.
463000	464000	Yeah.
464000	465000	So anyway.
465000	466000	OK.
466000	467000	Yeah.
467000	468000	But it's it's pretty nasty outside.
468000	472000	This is the first time I've come close to having an asthma attack since I got over the
472000	473000	pneumonia.
473000	474000	Yeah it was really nasty outside.
474000	475000	No outdoor gaming for me today.
475000	476000	That's for sure.
476000	478000	Let's get ash in the air.
478000	480000	Let's get into the kickoff topic though.
480000	483000	And Loki I'll ask you to kind of lead us on this topic.
483000	486000	And this has to do a little more with gaming culture I suppose.
486000	492000	This is kind of a twitch related topic but as we're using twitch to come together and
492000	498000	play games online I think more so than ever with everything that's going on in the world
498000	502000	this certainly still relates to our industry right.
502000	507000	Yeah it's kind of it's sad to see something like this.
507000	509000	I'm sure that the company.
509000	512000	I don't even know how you pronounce this.
512000	514000	I'll go be.
514000	515000	Does it matter.
515000	523000	Some media company a marketing company that was working with Burger King did this campaign
523000	527000	called The King of Stream.
527000	528000	OK.
528000	529000	Oh we'll be.
529000	531000	Yeah it doesn't matter.
531000	535000	I don't want to put any effort into getting that right since their campaign was very low
535000	536000	effort as well.
536000	540000	Well we're about to drag them and expose them so it doesn't matter if we get it right.
540000	542000	It doesn't matter.
542000	547000	So what they did was you may know watching several twitch streamers you may know that
547000	555000	some streamers will have kind of a voice to chat text to speech type thing when they receive
555000	561000	donations and it'll have like a little message when you typed out with the donation stuff
561000	562000	and it'll read it.
562000	567000	SSJ 100 Matt has subscribed for three months and says shout out to clicky the pan.
567000	568000	I think your show is great.
568000	571000	Hello L. Mr. Smoosh meow meow.
571000	573000	Which is why we don't do that in our show.
573000	576000	That would be a train wreck.
576000	577000	Right.
577000	580000	I don't want to shade anybody that does that.
580000	584000	You do what works for you and like for accessibility reasons too.
584000	586000	That could be a damn useful plug in.
586000	591000	So but obviously we're trying to it's worth saying we're trying to do a podcast that you
591000	595000	know and that's why we don't do the typical acknowledgments of subs and everything until
595000	599000	the very very very end of the show after we end the recording.
599000	601000	And it's not that we don't appreciate it any less.
601000	608000	It's just we realize that unfortunately this is like I can I can now use this as something
608000	609000	to point to and go.
609000	611000	This is why we don't do it.
611000	616000	So what they did is they basically they created a box or did something where they found certain
616000	623000	streamers that had very minimal like set up basically just like a headshot that they could
623000	628000	crop out and gameplay none of the like complicated interfaces and everything that they would
628000	629000	have normally on there.
629000	638000	And then they use this text to speech functionality to post advertisements for Burger King on
638000	644000	these streams and then they captured as part of their web campaign which is ridiculous
644000	649000	because there's so many things wrong with that with new different streamers may have deals
649000	653000	with certain brands and that may go against those deals.
653000	659000	Also you know a lot of these folks if you want to advertise on their streams I'm sure that they
659000	663000	would love to be able to work out some sort of marketing deal that would certainly be worth
663000	665000	more than five dollars.
665000	670000	And so a perfect example just just to give a tangible example that there was a whole subway
670000	676000	promotion through Twitch not that long ago where subway was basically like I think they were
676000	682000	like absorbing some of the cost of subs or something where people were I think we were getting
682000	689000	the whole five dollars for a sub as opposed to 250 because and get it sub because what subway is
689000	695000	they and that's how you do it right a little play a dumb little dad joke there to tie it together
695000	699000	and that's I mean somebody in chat probably remembers the details better than I do but that was
699000	705000	through Twitch official everybody kind of knew it we all know the rules and it was a much better
705000	707000	I think promotion.
707000	709000	Yeah.
709000	717000	Yeah and so there were originally when I saw this video I thought it was faked because the gameplay
717000	720000	that they show behind everything is obviously fake.
720000	722000	That's what I thought too none of those games were real.
722000	731000	I couldn't figure out what they did is they superimpose the actual live stream of the actual
731000	737000	Twitch streamer and they put it on fake gameplay but it's actually real reactions and everything
737000	742000	and there was one of the there's a few of the Twitch streamers actually posted like the actual
742000	748000	video from their streams showing this happening and like having like what they've cut out of it
748000	754000	and stuff but it's just it's really shady it's it's a terrible campaign I thought originally they
754000	759000	did it just as kind of like I thought it was faked and I thought they did it for like outrage
759000	761000	marketing type of thing.
761000	763000	Yeah there's a lot of people thinking that in the beginning.
763000	770000	Yeah but apparently no it was actual streamers just a lot of you know smaller streamers which
770000	773000	that's horrible though like it's it's just exploiting them.
774000	779000	So I think that this is fair game then as long as I dropped five bucks for you know a sandwich
779000	783000	or something over there I'm allowed to put whatever advertisements I want in their store.
783000	788000	That that it's basically they've set the precedent so I'm allowed to do it now.
788000	793000	You are allowed to stand you are allowed to stand up on the counter and scream whatever advertisement
793000	798000	you want unfortunately that may involve you getting escorted out of the store but you know
798000	802000	well and plus in these days and times you're not really eating inside the store anyway but you know
802000	804000	I digress.
804000	809000	Yeah so yeah so yeah there was a video like was one of the streamers a rubber ninja had posted a
809000	815000	video on Twitch he was playing a Mario maker 2 and it was showing you know kind of it that part
815000	822000	wasn't included in their campaign but he got one of those messages and so he posted that
822000	827000	and to see you know kind of his reaction to it as well so it's just ridiculous.
827000	833000	Yeah it's kind of a low blow but I think it's also I mean this is a chance for the streaming
833000	837000	community to also kind of like learn something from this and be cautious about this because there
837000	841000	was a really good comment and I have yet to acknowledge and welcome the chat room I'm sorry
841000	845000	guys but we were doing an important dedication at the top of the show so I do want to say hello to
845000	849000	the chat because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern
849000	854000	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash v o g
854000	859000	network voice of geeks network and there's some really good comments in here for example no one
859000	866000	special 77 starts off with a comment saying TTS or text to speech can too easily be abused
866000	873000	to be honest sure as shit some shithead would use TTS to say something racist or otherwise
873000	883000	disgusting and yes because that sort of thing happened right here on OLR right here like three
883000	889000	weeks ago remember that we had all those people that suddenly started watching and they all had
889000	894000	nasty names that I wouldn't read on air but because we have the thing that ticks across the
894000	899000	bottom they some of those names got out and I'm sorry about that that was but that was a
899000	905000	learning experience for us and now I've learned how to shut that off instantly so if if if a
905000	912000	name like that sneaks through you better believe you're only going to see one so and so yeah
912000	916000	you're right that kind of stuff can be abused and I think this is a good wake up call for all the
916000	922000	streamers out there who are using that text to speech plug in do they maybe want to keep using it
922000	927000	and again you have to do what works for you but maybe there would be like a filter or I don't
927000	932000	know you have to use a mod team or something yeah I would think well with some of that I'm not
932000	937000	sure about the the text to speech stuff but I think with the donations I'm sure there's some
937000	943000	sort of chat filters and stuff much like how there's moderation I would assume that that
943000	950000	functionality still exists and if that sniper thing was kind of being exploited granted they
950000	954000	can set the minimums on those donations to be read out I think and that's when the bot was doing
954000	959000	it was bidding the minimum so five dollars was one of the more expensive ones but I think in
959000	964000	the video they have like one dollar and three dollars so you're getting a one dollar advertisement
964000	968000	I mean that's kind of ridiculous and I could see like maybe if they did that like after like
968000	975000	contacting these people to do some sort of agreement but there's there's no sponsorship in
975000	980000	it wasn't disclosed it was a sponsorship deal or anything like that because it wasn't it was just
980000	988000	like basically this gorilla ad and I'm worried that like you know if this is successful like
988000	994000	you know we're gonna see a lot more abuse of this type of thing I don't know well I think you're
994000	997000	getting money you might not care I mean if especially if you're a smaller streamer but yeah
997000	1002000	like it's still kind of shady though it's like well it even had in the video like they kind of
1002000	1008000	pointed out it's like well are you gonna just you know are we gonna do like a brand deal or
1008000	1013000	something are we gonna you're gonna sponsor me are you just gonna you're just gonna do this
1013000	1019000	nonsense to clarify though I see that there was a clarification on the article here saying that
1019000	1031000	apparently that David Madrid ran the campaign not necessarily all will be but not their main team I
1031000	1036000	guess they're associated somehow this David whatever shame on you whoever you are yeah it
1036000	1043000	doesn't matter it's just it's it's irritating though that they would do this and that
1043000	1050000	unsurprising I don't know I mean yeah I haven't seen has Burger King come out to even like say
1050000	1055000	anything about this and yeah but when did this break Friday it might not be out till Monday
1055000	1061000	yeah where's this like because this is like kind of I think there it wasn't like Burger King
1061000	1067000	tweeting this out it was this ad campaign was the ad campaign so I'm wondering where this is
1067000	1073000	you and SSG 100 Matt says shame on them for signing off on it talking about the burger chain
1073000	1077000	saying because ultimately they had to sign off on it because they had to approve the use of their
1077000	1081000	image you know this particular burger chain and again I hate giving them free advertising on the
1081000	1088000	show but it is worth mentioning I suppose this chain has thought outside the box with the gaming
1088000	1094000	industry a couple of times because yes this was crap and I think we all agree this particular
1094000	1100000	campaign was crap but let's not forget this was the same group or I don't know who did this ad
1100000	1106000	campaign but they did that genius Xbox 360 thing I mean that grant was probably 10 years ago at
1106000	1111000	this point but that was what brought us the sneak king and the bumper car game and all that stuff
1111000	1119000	that was actually that was rad and we all loved that so I I think it is worth saying not every
1119000	1126000	idea that burger chain chain has had has been awful this one is but it's a little bit I guess
1126000	1131000	maybe less surprisingly here they're trying to come up with these crazy ideas when you look at
1131000	1136000	the track record that they've done it before yeah like and I would say like if you want to even
1136000	1141000	talk about more recent success in kind of advertising like that look at KFC and what they're
1141000	1148000	doing like putting out fake games and stuff like that I would love a new set of Burger King games
1148000	1152000	to be honest even how cringy those were before that's what made them great like come on put some
1152000	1158000	more of those out again like I'm surprised that we don't see something like that or or you know
1158000	1163000	like a live stream where the king is playing games or something like that because I think they even
1163000	1167000	do have like Chuck E. Cheese or something like that is they have that kind of thing now so it's
1167000	1172000	like do something like that like just like lean full into that kind of stuff because that would
1172000	1178000	be funny and I think would give them more attention rather than we're gonna exploit some
1178000	1183000	people I mean that um orange right in chat says they also did that one commercial where they try
1183000	1190000	to get people's I've learned not to say these words on air so I'm gonna spell it a LEX A's to tell
1190000	1195000	you what the big where the big burger or what the big burger was or whatever it is so basically
1195000	1201000	you know virtual assistant yeah okay yeah hey virtual assistant you know tell me about this
1201000	1207000	and then the device goes off and I've had I've had people email this show saying you need to stop
1207000	1213000	saying things like and the the those things because my virtual assistant actually responded
1213000	1228000	to it we do we call them how close the next time I get a pet I'm gonna name it one of those no
1228000	1232000	and don't apologize orange right it was a good comment I just I those are the types of things I
1232000	1237000	have to filter is that oh yes I can't say a LEX A or it's actually gonna activate somebody's device
1237000	1247000	and it's so fun so you guys all know I've oh yeah I could that's a good idea yeah axilla okay
1247000	1258000	so my dad as you know I've been talking about the issues he's been going through he had a stroke
1258000	1263000	a few weeks ago and I'm really happy to report that he's made a virtual full recovery because
1263000	1267000	like the physical therapist actually even signed off like I have no need to come back you're doing
1267000	1274000	fine but my point is he got an Alexa well I'm sorry if I just activated it I guess I was too close to the real thing
1274000	1280000	axilla sorry um but he just got one of those and like he was like I was over there visiting and he
1280000	1289000	was like well you know the and he he points out he goes the the a LEX A but now he's actually kind
1289000	1294000	of using it for things but the point to get in one of those was it's it's kind of like the modern
1294000	1301000	equivalent of the I fallen and I can't get up is that if something happens to him he can say you
1301000	1311000	know you know who called an ambulance basically so anyway Oh Quest Buster says how about basically
1311000	1317000	getting to this point how about ax lay one of the greatest Super Nintendo shooters can call it
1317000	1325000	ax lay I like that point for you all right anything else to say about this crappy twitch campaign
1325000	1331000	and which I twitch is not involved with twitch is merely the mechanism being used to deliver it
1331000	1337000	and it's it's pretty shady but I think a lot of streamers now are probably going to be be evaluating
1337000	1346000	do I want this because do I want to be taken advantage by this so yeah I mean it's it's unfortunate
1346000	1351000	but like I'm surprised it hasn't been done sooner yeah I know I know yeah it is kind of surprising
1351000	1356000	we haven't seen it sooner so all right well let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks and the
1356000	1360000	types of video games that we have been playing this week so dark soccer I'll start with you you
1360000	1367000	have two weeks if you want I really it's really just been Animal Crossing and I finally beat my
1367000	1379000	stupid word find game like I did 1500 puzzles in it I played Orna I touched it did you really
1379000	1392000	congrats I did I did some stuff in it and you know I was also intoxicated but I I've I really need
1392000	1397000	to get back to the last of us it's just that with you know I've got some behind the scenes crap
1397000	1404000	going on you know medical stuff so I haven't really had like a whole lot of time and then
1404000	1412000	when I have had time I've just been really tired so but we did bust out the Saturn and Dan was
1412000	1419000	playing elevator action returns which you know he loves that game and so I'm thinking about busting
1419000	1426000	out grandia again but I found a place that does that applies the English translation patch and I
1426000	1434000	don't think I would need to use a modded Saturn for it so I have to check but I was going to see
1434000	1440000	about maybe getting the translated Saturn grandia because it blows the PlayStation one out of the
1440000	1445000	water you know the PlayStation one doesn't do like the same scaling the aspect ratio is a little
1445000	1454000	bit different the graphics are not as good believe it or not for 3d and I've also been looking
1454000	1462000	at picking up some of those Dreamcast titles the after release ones so I'm doing a little bit of
1462000	1468000	perusing but we've also got other tech stuff on hand so you're going to be seeing a lot more
1469000	1475000	Apple arcade stuff coming for me I have been playing a lot of pattern but I don't go and say
1475000	1480000	this Dan and I are our 15th wedding anniversary comes up on September 1st oh wow that's right is
1480000	1486000	around the corner and since we're not going to New Orleans like the initial plan was because I have
1486000	1497000	some places to take him that's my old stomping grounds so instead we we took advantage of some
1497000	1505000	of some situations and we bought iPad iPad pros for ourselves yeah he needs the cellular one I
1505000	1511000	need a bigger hard drive so we got him a smaller cellular one we got me the bigger hard drive one
1511000	1517000	I accidentally ordered two Apple pencils oops so but for me I'm going to use it as a graphics
1517000	1522000	tablet but I want to start doing a little bit more gaming on it just because I really think that
1522000	1529000	tablet gaming is absolutely the way that a lot of portable gaming is going to go sure you know
1529000	1534000	we've got a lot of us have switches and playing that portable that's great but we already knew
1534000	1541000	Sony took their stab at it and it went I mean that to be so loud so I'm just I'm saying I want to
1541000	1547000	I'm going to put a little bit more into the other types of portable gaming and maybe give some more
1547000	1552000	reports on it I would say if Sony went but it's only because Sony didn't invest in it long enough
1552000	1557000	like I just and and there were just a few key mistakes they made that really felt like they were
1557000	1563000	detached from it but I mean the hardware the cell the PSP was a great device and so was the video
1563000	1568000	like they were great devices they just they just made a few like really key errors that were
1568000	1574000	catastrophes I'll tell you with the Vita I actually like some of the games on it so much that I
1574000	1580000	just got a PSTV you know I got the PSTV so I could play Danganronpa Ultra Despair Girls
1580000	1585000	and then there was that Tempest thing that was by the guy that made Tempest 2000 right
1585000	1591000	there were a lot of good games that I could just play on my PSTV that were absolutely wonderful
1591000	1600000	I actually do gaming now a little bit on my Apple TV I have the SteelSeries Bluetooth controller
1600000	1604000	and I've been playing Patterned on that I love Patterned
1604000	1610000	I just have to shove in here this is a great point that Bobby Blackwolf is saying in chat
1610000	1616000	I'm saying I'm considering getting a Samsung Galaxy tab for Project xCloud and that's a really good point
1616000	1621000	is that now you have a lot of like these streaming things that are you know going so it's like a tablet
1621000	1627000	can still let you play console games now I do understand there's issues with the whole Apple App Store
1627000	1634000	and the Microsoft platform and the Google state and all that I just I kind of tend to be on the side of
1634000	1640000	it will get worked out in the end because Netflix is there CBS All Access is there Spotify is there
1640000	1645000	and where all that stuff came through I do feel like it will come through eventually
1645000	1650000	it's just going to take a little time I think so even on those devices you named
1650000	1659000	no comment I know even on those devices you named you can potentially in the future play some type of streaming from a console
1659000	1666000	yeah but I only really care about the stuff I get an Apple Arcade I kind of want to keep those aspects separate
1666000	1676000	and actually I did play another game I'm in a beta I am in a beta for a game called Roll
1676000	1684000	that's it's put out by hold on I'm trying to find it again but yeah I got I'm in a beta called Roll
1684000	1692000	it's kind of like a build a deck sort of card game with dice and I haven't quite gotten the hang of it
1692000	1701000	I think the rules are a little confusing of it but but I am doing it through the iPhone beta testing software
1701000	1707000	I've got access to it so I've been really enjoying enjoying trying to get it the fuck figured out
1707000	1713000	it's a really pretty game just you know yeah it's called Roll for the Galaxy sorry
1713000	1722000	and I'll for those who are watching that's what my screen looks like so it's pretty neat so far
1722000	1728000	I'm kind of kind of digging it once I can get it better figured out and I kind of miss this card game
1728000	1730000	so yeah that's the other thing I'm playing
1730000	1737000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says we love Roll for the Galaxy and Estrinio and her mat is like can you talk about it
1737000	1740000	like is this actually something you're allowed to talk about right now
1740000	1748000	yeah this stuff it's like a public beta now the version I'm playing I have to go through the beta testing app
1748000	1757000	because the full version isn't out but yeah Bobby I'm gonna have to pick your brain for like how to make this work
1757000	1764000	so because I'm no good at it I haven't really got the concept of it yet so I might pick your brain about it
1764000	1768000	all right Loki do you want to go next
1768000	1779000	sure so I played a little bit of Orna this week I've been mainly just watching tutorials online for different game dev things
1779000	1783000	I've been really focusing on a specific area and so I've been doing that
1783000	1788000	yeah that's all I can really say about that right now
1788000	1799000	and then what else I have a little bit of Minecraft I played Minecraft this week and I think that's about it
1799000	1807000	all right then I'll talk about my gaming week so for my gaming week a lot of the same stuff
1807000	1814000	still been playing final fantasy 14 because I always do and they brought back the yokai watch crossover event
1814000	1819000	so I was working on that and I got one of my mounts for getting all the minions so that's cool
1819000	1826000	it was really hard to understand how that stupid event works because you have to like use an item to get these metals
1826000	1832000	you use the metals to buy minions you use the minions to get certain weapons but you have to be in certain zones to get them
1832000	1839000	if it sounds complicated that's because it is but thanks to the lovely community there's some infographics that really helped break it down and explain it a little better
1839000	1844000	so I got through it so I'm up to having like three of those weapons so yeah
1844000	1852000	and let's see what else did I play this week as far as like old stuff you know the old standby stuff before the fires got crazy
1852000	1860000	between Ingress and Orna I hit 193 today level 193 in Orna it really like you can get through those first hundred levels pretty quick
1860000	1866000	and then it really starts to ramp up like the crawl from 175 to now has been very very slow
1866000	1873000	but that's good game design honestly because you don't want it to you know you don't want it to be a rush to the end
1873000	1877000	and then there's nothing to do because you're at the end and you're the most powerful player in the entire world
1877000	1883000	and a new game I played this week so yes I forced myself to play something new
1883000	1890000	I bought this game based on all the positive things I was hearing about it when it showed up at a Nintendo event earlier this week
1890000	1897000	which we'll talk about later on in the show so you might piece it together the game I bought on PC is called Hades
1897000	1905000	and it is from Supergiant Games who did Bastion was like their big game and they did what was the other game called Pyre
1905000	1909000	and there's one other one too what's that Logang you're muted
1909000	1914000	I was gonna say you didn't have it for free on the Epic Games Store because that was one of the first games that they offered
1914000	1920000	no I think I missed it whenever they gave it away on the Epic Games Store so I just bought it on Steam whatever
1920000	1927000	so yeah I hey I'm all about kicking some coin to the developer so I've been playing it on Steam
1927000	1937000	and yeah it's neat because it's kind of like a roguelike but it's a very kind of like cartoony looking game
1937000	1945000	but like in a cool way and it really like my computer's a couple years old it runs really smooth and it was just a really fluid
1945000	1951000	I think that's a good way to describe it really like kind of like fluid type of action style game and yeah I was enjoying it
1951000	1957000	you know I kind of had to figure it out like how to do everything but I suppose sometimes games kind of make you do that
1957000	1963000	so yeah that's that's a game on PC that I've heard a lot of great things about from friends
1963000	1969000	because I know they were very hyped when they announced the Switch version was coming and it was going to carry over your progress from the PC
1969000	1977000	so I thought that was pretty cool so yeah so I checked it out so all right that was my gaming week so that's it
1977000	1985000	let's get into some other gaming news all right how about Loki you want to start us off with some gaming news
1985000	1993000	yes so there's always some sort of controversy going on and now of course we have E3 having to apologize
1993000	2001000	so the E3 twitter account which is owned by the ESA of course they had tweeted out you know like those
2001000	2010000	news is slow so let's tweet out something to keep our engagement up so they had great list of games women gamers are playing
2010000	2020000	any of your favorites making the cut and it was from an article by Parade which included a bunch of games
2020000	2028000	you know just like kind of cliche games I guess but they had like you know some ridiculous stuff like Bajool classic
2028000	2036000	because diamonds are a girl's best friend am I right ladies just kind of you know sexist stuff in there and apparently
2036000	2044000	the article was written by a woman but you know and maybe it was her it was sexism right there
2044000	2054000	yeah no I know I'm not excusing it but I think it is a point that you have to say but it was definitely like it might have been her 25 favorite games
2054000	2062000	which is fine and whatever reason she liked those games great but to project that on everyone else is ridiculous
2062000	2064000	anyway I'm sorry Loki I'll let you finish
2064000	2074000	no no and from my understanding that the woman who wrote the article actually I don't know if she was very familiar with gaming in general
2074000	2082000	because she had posted a tweet earlier that was saying hey I ran this article about gaming anybody can help me out with this
2083000	2094000	and no responses so maybe this was just kind of searching the internet for you know taking other top ten lists or something and kind of compiling that together
2094000	2100000	I don't know it seems like kind of the filler piece that you would put out you know slow news type thing
2100000	2110000	which is exactly what Parade is by the way it's that insert in the Sunday newspaper that's what Parade is literally
2110000	2113000	so yeah it's literally filler content
2113000	2120000	so yeah so of course people were upset because you know it's a lot of cliches were in there and stuff and I don't know instead of
2120000	2130000	personally like I would have been like yeah okay bad articles bad you know I mean like just look at the source just like okay well these people aren't necessarily
2130000	2135000	it's not like otaku writing an article you know top games or whatever
2135000	2137000	I don't go to Parade for my gaming news
2137000	2142000	exactly so this is the type of article I might actually expect out of Parade to be quite honest
2142000	2151000	I don't know if we necessarily like need to jump down there perhaps you know ESA should have known better
2151000	2158000	I mean maybe you get better people you know some folks that are better doing the social media thing
2158000	2172000	instead of just randomly tweeting stuff out maybe you know look over the links that you're you know make sure that the content doesn't seem like it's going to be something that you would want to offend a group of people with like I don't know
2172000	2183000	to make the problem with this very clear it's not the fact that the article exists that's a problem because again it's this you know it's just it's some you know filler piece that was written by Parade
2183000	2200000	it's the fact that E3 amplified it that they use their social media in their account to amplify it and basically say this is representative of women in gaming that is a huge problem huge problem
2200000	2211000	and you know and I almost wonder you know we brought up Drag Race earlier in the show and I'm sorry not sorry but I'm going to use another reference because I think it actually fucking applies here
2211000	2225000	Dark Sakura do you remember when RuPaul got in a lot of trouble because of some of the there well and still is in trouble really because of the poor trans representation on RuPaul's Drag Race
2225000	2233000	I mean granted we've had Gia gone and things like that you're muted yeah yeah I just noticed yeah no that's terrible that was some bullshit
2233000	2251000	Do you remember when RuPaul in an attempt to save a little face went to her Twitter account and wrote a tweet saying the only criteria to be on our show is that you have charisma uniqueness and urban talent and then posted a flag
2252000	2269000	and do you know what flag that RuPaul posted on her Twitter account I do not remember that it was a trains flag what the bitch went to Google and googled trains flag
2269000	2285000	t-r-a-i-n-s flag I'm gonna have to look that bullshit up because that's funny I mean this but if you know it's it's Tara it's like one of those like oh my god grandma stop you're making it worse like it's one of those type of situations
2286000	2304000	So anyway the reason why I bring that up and yes it is relevant here to E3 you're damn right I just tied RuPaul and E3 together because I bet E3 realizing oh today is the 100th anniversary of women getting the right to vote
2305000	2327000	you know what we should do we should post an article about women gaming let's go to Google women playing game and what do you want to bet I would bet you money that is what happened at E3 headquarters please note that is not excusing it that is not saying it was okay I'm just pointing out how stupid of a mistake it was
2327000	2338000	yeah and how you can't rely on way you rely on Google to do your social media work yes that's the first article that pops up
2341000	2349000	Rob Roberts industry analyst they get please use my title please use my title moving forward
2349000	2378000	I'm sorry I just had like a big oops and now my vehicle Voltron is missing his head act Efton chat says let Loki speak no it's my week to speak yes Loki can speak just the thing is is that I'm really tired of these tone deaf celebrities thinking that you know just because they have fame on their side that what they have to say is relevant and know the fuck not it's relevant you need to learn to shut your fuck up and know your role
2379000	2397000	you know I'm thinking of 25 games that women play I'm using my quote he fingers and I'm like you know clearly the people at E3 who probably didn't even read this article before posting it they do not know the same people that I know because I'm like where's where's Resident Evil
2397000	2414000	where's Dead by Daylight where's like all the murder games because maybe it's just the women I know but like there's a lot of you know what actually at the end of the day you know what games women are playing the exact same games as men and that my friends should have been the tweet
2414000	2438000	should have been the tweet so it's just a bunch of misogynist garbage because like we are 50% of the gaming population like that is a bona fide number and the fact that these you know little shits are out there and yeah I'm gonna I'm on a roll I'm gonna I'm gonna put my Voltron back together and explain a thing
2439000	2463000	actually legit broke off that's sad anyway but at any rate what I was gonna say is that we are still fighting stereotypes that have been perpetrated not just in the video games but of course it's gonna bleed over because everything at some point was a man's domain
2463000	2480000	that's that was the thought you know but then you want to look actually more into the way history is gone women have been I'd say some of the oh gosh some of the truest innovators like I'm gonna actually throw out a historical thing out here you know where the word computer came from
2480000	2509000	where they would actually use humans to compute complex mathematical equations and at the beginning of the space race it was women specifically many women of color on top of it who were human computers hidden figures is all about right well part of it yeah you know but it was something that had gone on in plenty of other scientific fields too
2509000	2538000	and then but now we have this thing where oh math and science is the man's thing blah blah blah or like Barbie I don't like math you know I mean but look at it we we like kind of the scary violent stuff I mean how many women do you know who know all about serial killers just saying and we ain't gonna play Resident Evil please and that whole thing's gotten even more in 2020 right because y'all are staying at home and watching Netflix Docs
2539000	2568000	for the record I am not a serial killer fan I just like watching unsolved mysteries and forensic files because I like forensic files I like I started off in college and geology that's what my sister does for a living so believe me I'm surrounded by it and I hate that stuff I hate it I hate it well but I like the science around it but but I mean like y'all have seen the games that I'm into and I am certainly not alone in it you know
2569000	2579000	like how how many times have I played through the Mass Effect trilogy how many times I played through Dragon Age what am I playing right now other than Animal Crossing you know
2579000	2592000	and that's why it's so irritating that this list comes out and it's like Candy Crush and I mean granted Animal Crossing was on it but any list in 2020 is gonna have Animal Crossing on it because it's what a lot of people are playing
2593000	2612000	men women non binaries everybody all ages all we're all every single one of us is playing Animal Crossing because it's the escapism that we have right now you know so I just it just it was the infuriating part of that is how E3 endorsed that and I was really mean on Twitter
2612000	2636000	I don't get nasty to corporations on Twitter very often I don't but I went like I went full 11 Karen on the ESA because what I thought was very interesting it's the E3 tweet that went viral the ESA the actual organization that puts on E3 wrote the same thing and two people had replied to it I was one of them
2636000	2655000	and my reply was basically along the lines of how dare you represent this organization when you tweet tone deaf stuff like this and give this stuff a voice I don't maybe I could dig up my tweet but it was just basically like and that's where that's where my mind was that is that what what don't you don't you remember
2656000	2678000	when video games were for nerds were for people in mom's basement when video games were frowned on because only like people with social problems play video games because they have nothing else to do that's how a certain generation of individuals views video games and probably still does today
2679000	2694000	I feel like a comment on here by someone who goes by Stephanie not a burrito I've been playing video games for 30 years and you're still going to reduce me to checks notes Kim Kardashian Hollywood adventure I hope someone loses their job over this garbage article
2694000	2718000	yeah and and it's just it infuriated me that the ESA is obviously being run by people in that same generation who think that you know gamers are shut ins and and social recluses and things like that well guess what everyone it's 2020 and in the year 2020 we believe that video games are for everyone
2718000	2745000	and that that is the message that a organization that claims to support this industry that takes this industry's money to represent their best interest that puts on this show that is supposed to be the pinnacle thing of our industry every year that's the message the ESA is obligated to communicate is that video games are for everyone
2745000	2771000	so when they tweet out this tone deaf shit instead that is what is infuriating and by golly that is why the ESA is imploding and that is why E3 isn't happening it's not because of COVID it's because the ESA is a mismanaged organization and this is proof we need new representation in the video game industry
2772000	2774000	I rest my case
2777000	2796000	it's, it's just more shit like that that makes it really hard to be a woman or demi woman or anyone on the female end of the spectrum of gender to still be taken seriously in gaming I mean I still get bullshit
2796000	2813000	I mean and how long have I been fucking doing this show 18 years right. Mm hmm. You know I have friends of mine who are, who don't play online games anymore because of toxic little man children on the internet.
2813000	2832000	And then we have E3 who's supposed to you know like you were saying represent all the gamers pulling this no you're not making anything any easier for us we we play the same games the dudes do okay gaming knows no gender. Fuck off.
2832000	2844000	The ESA has still not apologized for the data breach of all the journalists and their personal information from E3. When is change going to happen at that organization.
2844000	2848000	It's time.
2848000	2853000	And until they make changes at that organization you can kiss E3 goodbye.
2853000	2865000	Because it's not that it shouldn't happen. It's that it's going to fall up its own asshole so hard. It can't happen until they make changes.
2865000	2866000	Am I wrong.
2866000	2876000	You're not wrong, but you remember what I told you about 2020 earlier today. Mm hmm. They can also eat a bag of rusty iron dicks.
2876000	2878000	Just saying.
2878000	2880000	Tiger claw linked.
2880000	2892000	Thank you. I can always trust Tiger claw or dark Tetsuya in chat to be the live fact checkers. While the show is going. So here's what I said to the ESA and I believe this.
2892000	2911000	The fact that you'd retweet this shit article that belittles women gamers is that they can't play the same stuff as men is a great example of one. The ESA is a badly run org to your expo is fucked and was fucked before COVID ever showed up, delete this ad and delete your entire account by.
2911000	2927000	And then I followed that up with a tweet that said me walking into the next ESA board meeting, and it's a video clip of Heidi and closet from RuPaul's Drag Race on tucked going, fuck you fuck you fuck you and fuck you.
2927000	2939000	Okay, so I'm actually making a tweet right now. I've been sitting on it for a while trying to decide what I want to say. Well, and I feel like I just want to say, I just before you send anything off, I just want to make sure you know.
2940000	2944000	E3 did pull the tweet and say we goofed.
2944000	2958000	Yeah, so screenshot so I know we all got the receipts girl but E3 did pull the tweet and say our bad. Basically, um, yeah, that's, that's kind of not good enough.
2958000	2965000	Yeah, you guys, not at all. There's a sweep under the rug movement you know it's it's basically garbage.
2965000	2979000	But what I said is here's my two cents on the E3 and their tweet gaming knows the gender women are 50% of the gaming community proven we play the same games the male end of the spectrum plays we play with non binary people play all genders play the
2979000	2983000	same pool of games kindly fuck off. Yeah.
2984000	2986000	Video games.
2986000	2996000	Attention ESA video games are for everyone. You put it on the flag, or you fucking get out of this industry.
2996000	3004000	Because you your archaic views are no longer welcome in this industry.
3004000	3006000	They're not.
3006000	3024000	The people are no longer welcome at all, just no matter what they say people who are like that I need a flag, I need a flag. Do you hear that people sing, sing the songs of angry men and women and non binary individuals.
3024000	3027000	I say humans.
3027000	3030000	Anyway, yeah.
3030000	3032000	It's bullshit.
3032000	3041000	Absolutely. All right, no we went off girl I know it's been it's been a nice novel will not sit still fine you want to sit in the front row you can sit in the front row.
3041000	3043000	All right, moving on.
3043000	3053000	Why why are you asking, do you need a little Pokemon Sorry, oh you can't. You guys can't even see because that part of my screens cut off Nevermind then. All right.
3054000	3068000	Do you need a trains flag. No, no we do not need a train spot my dad did work in trains for many years, and I'm sure he would appreciate it, but there's another community that needs our support, a little bit more right now and you're going to need to delete
3068000	3078000	one letter to make it. Oh my god I found the RuPaul tweet by the way that is some absolute bullshit is, isn't it one of those like grandma step away from the keyboard.
3078000	3089000	Grandma stop grandma, grandma, please do not please do not tweet at the Olive Garden grandma, they're not listening. I reposted my tweet with correct grammar so just saying.
3089000	3103000	All right, I'm going to move on to the next story just in the interest of time because we'll be here all night screaming at the ESA. All right, um, let's talk about some movement forward in our industry, shall we, and let's talk about Microsoft redoing the user
3104000	3116000	interface on the Xbox series x of course, and this is going to be something that will trickle down to Xbox one, and also going to impact what game pass will look like on PC as well as well as even Xbox on mobile.
3116000	3129000	So it's kind of like a unified interest interface across all of those platforms. So they showed some pictures of what it will look like it has some elements of a familiar looking crossbar, but I'm not going to say it's copy because it's very much not, they're
3129000	3132000	definitely doing kind of a different little spin on it.
3132000	3151000	And it does seem to make a little more sense, certainly than what Microsoft was doing before, which, for better or for worse, the Xbox one interface was designed for connect the gamers pushed back on connect and connect was forced to be removed, yet the interface that was still
3151000	3162000	like a connect interface was kind of stuck. So this is the first time now that Microsoft can kind of reinvent without feeling like connect is there because it's it's not for most people now.
3162000	3177000	So anyway, they went on to say that gamer choice is a big part of this. And this also strikes me as something that's in the messaging for the Xbox series x about how you need to be able to like flip games on a dime, like I'm playing this game and then I'm gonna flip over here
3177000	3198000	and pick off where I was at here. It's kind of part of like what the solid state drive and all this does. But you notice that continued messaging and what they say. That means the way you manage your hardware and games, the way you find what you want to play next and the way you communicate and share with friends, whatever device you use, we aspire to deliver an amazing Xbox experience that keeps you connected to games and friends throughout your day.
3198000	3214000	And then they talk about instant welcome and however you choose to play. So whether you're alone on your console or getting friends together. So they're kind of like, you know, tying that sort of element together to make that easier to understand for when you have guests.
3214000	3231000	And then they're talking about Xbox assist also on the console. And then of course, again, selling that like kind of solid state drive, the Xbox series x will set a new bars for speed when it launches this November. And we're taking the experience to accelerate across Xbox.
3231000	3248000	So I gotta say the Xbox interface, it does feel a little bit clunky. I think it's more the speed than anything that kind of bothers me about that interface. But PlayStation is just as bad if not worse, especially when you're trying to navigate the store.
3248000	3272000	So a nice bump in speed for hardware for both of these platforms is going to go a very long way. And it'll be kind of nice to see that everything is unified, you know, between all those different platforms. It also is bringing together the the PC environment and the Xbox environment even more so. So that's just going to make some people go even more. Do I really need an Xbox?
3272000	3293000	Well, if you're paying for Game Pass, then Microsoft still loves you no matter what, right? Crystal Skies 80 in our chat says I just reset up my Kinect. I'm not saying Kinect is bad. I'm just saying the gamers rejected it, meaning they did not believe it should be included with the Xbox one.
3293000	3312000	And to be fair, I think a big reason they rejected it is that the variety of Kinect and what it did in that interface in the Microsoft wasn't really sold very well. And the games, you know, it was a lot of dance games, a lot of fitness games. It never really broke that mold.
3312000	3336000	Yes, you started to see things like Disneyland adventures and stuff that was doing different stuff. But there was nothing like, let's say, Wii Sports in the Xbox one environment specifically. I would say they did a very good job with a lot of that stuff when Kinect was on 360. But there was nothing on that level with Xbox one. But anyway, let's see some other comments here.
3336000	3351000	VGRealness says the PS4 interface is so slow. I don't understand why it's so bad. Yeah, I agree. Yyr in chat says granted, it hasn't really been tailored for Kinect in a while. This is an evolution rather than a major change.
3351000	3375000	Yeah, I'm just saying that their base square that they had to start from had Kinect in it. So they were tied to that for a little bit until Microsoft was really free of that. And then they didn't really make a radical change from that. A lot of what you saw in that interface is still there. Yes, they made a lot of changes. But this is going to be a big change. But this is the time to do it, I think.
3375000	3385000	All right. Anyway, so I look forward to seeing how this is going to look on Series X and PC and all of that. So a new look for Microsoft coming later this year.
3385000	3392000	All right, moving on. Why don't we get to Dark Soccer? You have a follow up on some exciting stuff from this week?
3392000	3416000	I do. And I watched it happen last night. I was so excited. So Summer Games Done Quick 2020 was all online. It was amazing. And I saw some fantastic runs and had to mute the audio a couple of times. But overall, Dan and I tried to watch most of it even. We even had it on while both of us were working.
3416000	3428000	So we're super happy to say that after the week, they raised over two point three million for Doctors Without Borders. That's great.
3428000	3441000	And of course, they've had some really big donations from Yeti and Fan Gamer, but they also were able to take bits. The little biddies were were added into that final total as well.
3441000	3452000	And so we watched it ended with Pokemon Shield, which, you know, it was a nice give you a watch. I kind of half watched watched it, too. I watched the beginning of it. I thought it was really neat.
3452000	3461000	Had a lot of it going. I actually donated for the Half-Life Alex run, which then I tried to watch it and got like super motion sick.
3461000	3469000	But but it ended. They had hit the the incentive for the Isle of Armor.
3469000	3483000	So that was pretty cool. And yeah, I was I sat there and watch that number roll over. It was pretty rad. And of course, that's going to just go to help so many people.
3483000	3499000	And I really think that doing it online this way. I mean, you know, we miss the couch. We miss the in-person, you know, banter and everything. But it gave a chance to a lot of people to do their hosting chops like Bobby.
3499000	3508000	It gave a lot of different runners a chance to participate in it who might not have been able to come out otherwise.
3508000	3515000	You know, a very good point that came out about that run that Bobby was hosting the Devil May Cry 4 run, which was great. I watched that whole thing.
3515000	3522000	Bobby did a great job as host, even despite the technical hiccups that happens like he he just he did his job very well.
3522000	3529000	All the commentators were on fire. They were doing a very good job. But Bobby was very good at when he was called on. He did his thing.
3529000	3534000	He just popped in and out just like he's supposed to do and let the commentators get back to it. And none of his jokes.
3534000	3540000	I mean, he definitely prepared jokes, but they didn't feel forced. I thought he did a very, very good job. So props to him.
3540000	3548000	And I think it's it's weird to hear that a massive chat room actually responded positively to him because I associate so many chat rooms like garbage comments.
3548000	3556000	So I wasn't even in there, but some of our other VOG fam were in there and said Bobby got was well received and he earned he earned it.
3556000	3562000	So congratulations. But the point I want to make with the whole virtual thing, that whole Devil May Cry 4 run and how well received it was.
3562000	3575000	Well, the speed runner for that was a Russian guy. And if the thing had been in person, you know, just with the state of the world being as it is and the fact that just getting here from Russia is going to be expensive anyway.
3576000	3579000	He may not have been able to attend an in-person event. I don't know his life.
3579000	3586000	Maybe he could. But let's you know, let's say that there probably are some speed runners that couldn't do it if it was in person.
3586000	3591000	So the virtual event lended itself well to that. But I don't think I don't think it should all be.
3591000	3595000	Yeah, absolutely. And I don't think it should all be virtual.
3595000	3599000	Well, obviously during covid, it's going to have to be. But, you know, long term, you know, the four years from now.
3600000	3606000	I think the nice thing will be maybe there's a little hybrid there. There's still the in-person convention, fun stuff.
3606000	3611000	But maybe when they need 30 minutes to change something up on the stage, you know what?
3611000	3618000	We're going to go to a god mode exhibition right now from one of our speed runners in Russia.
3618000	3623000	Let's let's go to it, you know, and that could be a really cool way to maybe fill some time.
3623000	3629000	And then I know a lot of it becomes a more international event in the unites the world.
3629000	3635000	World of gamers. Yeah. So I think it would be great to maybe see like a little bit of a hybrid.
3635000	3638000	I don't I don't think it needs to like be mostly virtual.
3638000	3645000	I'm talking post covid and post pandemic, because if the flu of 1918 ended at one point, this one will, too.
3645000	3648000	It'll just take some time and some better leadership.
3648000	3651000	There's probably some games they wouldn't even be able to run.
3651000	3658000	I would think they're supposed to play with the exhibitions, with Pump It Up and stuff like that.
3658000	3664000	Pump It Up one's pretty cool. They might be able to do it if they were willing to broadcast from their arcade.
3664000	3671000	Because when they do it on site, you know, the on site and I didn't realize how much went on until Bobby and Jason last year were telling me about it.
3671000	3676000	But they have, you know, not just what you see on Twitch, but there's a whole 24 hour arcade next door.
3676000	3682000	They have panels going on. It's basically a week long gaming convention, essentially.
3682000	3687000	So it would be if they could get cameras in the arcade. Tokyo attacked. I'm sure they have Pump It Up machines.
3687000	3689000	They might be able to do it on site still.
3689000	3695000	But I'm thinking more like the VR stuff is a great example, because that's kind of a pain in the ass to set up in person.
3695000	3703000	And the runners who might not be able to get here otherwise would be great to have just a little bit of that international flavor.
3703000	3708000	You know, maybe one or two a day tops, you know, just to spice it up a little.
3708000	3715000	Do we, with all respect to the recaps and the clever things they're doing there, do we need that?
3715000	3720000	Or could we maybe squeeze in a couple other speed runs from around the globe?
3720000	3725000	But these are questions GDQ is going to have to answer. I'm not in a position to do that.
3725000	3729000	And I'm not I'm not saying it was bad before. Certainly not.
3729000	3736000	The constant question. We're already a 10 out of 10 event. How do we make it 11? Right?
3736000	3740000	And maybe these are questions to make it 11.
3740000	3748000	Questbuster in chat says the Half-Life Alyx run was awesome. Seeing the physical stuff the runner went through to do the tricks was a big part of that.
3748000	3754000	So, yeah, Bobby did a great job hosting and I tried to donate and get my donation read.
3754000	3762000	But I guess I snuck in an in-joke that didn't get through the screeners, which I so I'm not mad about it because the end of the day, it's about the charity.
3762000	3767000	It's about the speed runners. But when I send him my donation, I didn't put in my donation as Rob Roberts.
3767000	3771000	I put in my donation as Mr. Smoosh, hoping that Bobby would read that.
3771000	3776000	And then the people that know would laugh because, oh, that we know who Mr. Smoosh is.
3776000	3779000	But oh, well, it didn't get through. I did. I just did my usual one.
3779000	3787000	You know, every year that I've donated for the last however many years, I've always introduced myself the same way on everyone.
3787000	3792000	And then when Dan does it, he's just like, here's the money.
3792000	3795000	Here's the money. Like, take our money.
3795000	3802000	And the fact that Dan donates actually is saying something because he's pretty cheap.
3802000	3810000	All right. Let's move on, though. Congratulations to everybody involved with Games Done Quick, Bobby too.
3810000	3817000	And I don't know, was Jason involved? I didn't ask Jason if he had any involvement this year because he's been an on-site volunteer.
3817000	3823000	So I don't know if he did anything with a virtual event, but but but a hello and thank you to Jason for just being there anyway.
3823000	3827000	He does a lot of great work with our voiceovers, if nothing else.
3827000	3830000	Let's move on. We have more gaming news to get to.
3830000	3838000	Yes, this is exciting news that came out at the end of the Nintendo Indies little trailer that they did.
3838000	3841000	I wouldn't say it's a trailer. Direct, I guess.
3841000	3848000	But apparently Untitled Goose Game is going to be getting a new free update on September 23rd.
3848000	3853000	And as part of that, they're going to have co-op play being added to the game.
3853000	3856000	So that's pretty awesome. Twice the goose power.
3856000	3858000	It'll be Untitled Geese?
3858000	3861000	Yes, Untitled Geese Game.
3861000	3867000	Which has finally brought one of the pre-show bumpers to light.
3867000	3870000	So if you listen on the podcast feed, you don't understand what I'm talking about.
3870000	3877000	But if you watch on Twitch, it always opens up with and it's a throwback to some would say Dragon Con TV, which yes,
3877000	3879000	but it's a real, real throwback to the show.
3879000	3885000	You can't do that on television where something is preempted so that the in fact, you know what?
3885000	3891000	Hell with it. Hell with it. Even for you podcast folks, I'm going to play one right now.
3891000	3897000	So it has the little animation here for VOG and then it gets into this.
3897000	3904000	Microsoft Fight Simulator will not be seen tonight so that we can bring you this special presentation.
3904000	3908000	OK, so ha ha. Get it? Because Flight Simulator is a big game this week.
3908000	3911000	I worked very hard on photoshopping that logo, by the way.
3911000	3918000	So anyway, my point is, we actually had Untitled Geese Game as one of those before one of our episodes,
3918000	3922000	except it was a picture of Geese Howard from King of Fighting.
3923000	3926000	But still, we were close.
3926000	3928000	Predictable.
3932000	3934000	That would have been fun. Yeah.
3934000	3939000	But yes, I'm very, very excited to see that update. That'd be pretty fun to see.
3939000	3947000	And hey, we can see some co-op speed runs now because I know Untitled Geese Game was one that's been in previous GDQs.
3949000	3954000	Yeah, I can't wait to see what happens with that.
3954000	3956000	All right.
3956000	3962000	So let's talk about some of the other things that were shown at the Nintendo Direct, the Mini Direct, the Indie Direct.
3962000	3968000	I mentioned earlier in the show, I actually saw, hey, already a success because I ended up buying Hades
3968000	3973000	because of that Direct, but they did announce that Hades is going to be coming to the Switch as well.
3973000	3975000	So that's pretty cool.
3975000	3979000	They also spent a little time talking about a game called Raji, an ancient epic,
3979000	3986000	which is a game set in ancient India and inspired by Hindu and Balinese mythology.
3986000	3989000	I've been seeing our friend Shivam play it.
3989000	3990000	Yeah.
3990000	3993000	Talk about it. It looks really, really cool. I'm considering it.
3993000	3999000	It looks honestly like my gut reaction said it looks like Princess of Persia, like with the gameplay and everything.
3999000	4002000	I thought it looked pretty cool. So I'm definitely interested in picking that up.
4002000	4006000	I've heard some very positive things about it and that looks really cool.
4006000	4016000	It looks like it's a very tactful way to represent some of those stories and so forth in game.
4016000	4018000	I thought it was really cool.
4018000	4021000	They also showed Spiritfarer for the Switch.
4021000	4027000	Now, Spiritfarer also came out on Xbox Game Pass and I think it's also on Steam and Epic Store.
4027000	4031000	So Spiritfarer came out a lot of places, but it was also in this presentation.
4031000	4033000	So there is that.
4033000	4038000	And then a game called A Short Hike, which you can play at your own pace.
4038000	4040000	You choose whatever path you want.
4040000	4043000	It has a very interesting kind of retro look to it.
4043000	4045000	It was kind of interesting looking.
4046000	4053000	A very common theme for a lot of these things they announced during that Indie Direct releases today.
4053000	4055000	Like almost all of those things I mentioned.
4055000	4058000	Raji released today. Hades didn't.
4058000	4062000	But then Spiritfarer did. A Short Hike did.
4062000	4064000	And there was a couple others too.
4064000	4066000	So they announced there was Torchlight 3.
4066000	4068000	They showed it's going to be coming to the Switch as well.
4068000	4071000	A game called Takishi and Hiroshi.
4071000	4072000	I hope I said that right. Sorry.
4072000	4074000	Hypnospace Outlaw.
4074000	4078000	Card Shark, which looked kind of interesting.
4078000	4081000	I don't know. That was kind of a weird one to me, but I was interested.
4081000	4083000	Oh, here's the other later today.
4083000	4087000	Manifold Garden, which looked kind of like a physics puzzle type of game.
4087000	4089000	Kind of looked interesting.
4089000	4091000	I think Shane told me he was playing that and he enjoyed that.
4091000	4093000	So there's that.
4093000	4098000	Subnautica and Subnautica Below Zero were confirmed for a Switch launch in 2021.
4098000	4102000	Garden Story. That game looked really cute coming in 2021 as well.
4102000	4106000	Then there was Evergate and a game called Baron Breakfast.
4106000	4109000	Yeah, that was cute.
4109000	4113000	I forgot to mention what I was talking about in title of the game.
4113000	4115000	They announced that there's going to be a physical release of that as well.
4115000	4118000	So that's something else you can look forward to if you haven't picked it up yet.
4118000	4121000	Crystal Skies80 in our chat says,
4121000	4123000	Spiritfarer is Game of the Year material for me.
4123000	4125000	Well, that's quite the hype for that.
4125000	4127000	So I might have to check that out.
4127000	4128000	So many games. So little time.
4128000	4130000	But Spiritfarer is on Xbox Game Pass, thankfully.
4131000	4133000	So even though I might not get to it on Switch,
4133000	4136000	because, you know, I'll probably just get it on Game Pass,
4136000	4139000	I'll have to check it out. Sounds really cool.
4139000	4142000	So, yeah, I really, you know, the presentation overall,
4142000	4145000	I really enjoyed it. I thought for a quickie, you know,
4145000	4150000	and of course there's those goddamn people on Twitter
4150000	4154000	replying what Smash Brothers win.
4154000	4156000	New character Smash win. And it's like,
4156000	4158000	you fucking assholes, shut up.
4159000	4163000	Like, how much plainer English can Nintendo say,
4163000	4168000	this is an indie event and we're not showcasing anything first party today?
4168000	4170000	They're just trolling, I think. They know better.
4170000	4173000	Because they said it on the Twitter, they said it on the actual direct.
4173000	4176000	It's just people trolling, is what it is.
4176000	4179000	Fine. Then the trolls need to shut up, too,
4179000	4184000	because they're muffling the noise of the people that are legitimately excited about some of the games.
4184000	4187000	And I thought Nintendo did a really good job on that presentation.
4187000	4190000	Or I should say the indies did a really good job on that presentation.
4190000	4194000	So, all right. Well, let's move on.
4194000	4197000	We have more stories. Right, DarkSagra?
4198000	4200000	That we do. That we do.
4200000	4206000	So, and you actually made a little mention of this as far as style.
4206000	4208000	We were talking about that other game,
4208000	4213000	but Prince of Persia, the remake, there's a listing for it online
4213000	4219000	for Nintendo Switch and PS4, estimated to be released November of this year.
4219000	4224000	And if you are a Prince of Persia fan, I mean, honestly enough,
4224000	4227000	I think it would be absolutely delightful to have something like that on Switch.
4227000	4231000	Although the main dude only looks like vaguely Persian.
4231000	4233000	So, just saying.
4233000	4240000	Well, that is a classic, classic PC gaming to our early, late 80s computing.
4240000	4246000	I think the original Prince of Persia was like Apple IIe and Commodore 64 and TI-99A.
4246000	4249000	Like, you know, all those computers that were out in the 80s.
4249000	4251000	That original was like a quintessence.
4251000	4254000	Actually, no, I don't know if it goes back quite that far.
4254000	4256000	I don't know if it goes all the way back to Apple IIe,
4256000	4261000	but certainly like Macintosh and like that maybe later 80s era of home computing.
4261000	4263000	Well, I have more.
4263000	4267000	So, at any rate, Ubisoft hasn't given any confirmation about it,
4267000	4271000	but we do have an Ubisoft Forward event happening pretty soon.
4271000	4281000	And the source came from a Nintendo distributor in Guatemala called Max.
4281000	4288000	So, take it as you will, but I would imagine they had to have something to make that go.
4288000	4291000	And we've been seeing the Prince of Persia rumors, you know,
4291000	4293000	going around about a new version coming out.
4294000	4297000	And one of the engineers from Ubisoft teasing something.
4297000	4299000	So, we'll see what happens.
4299000	4302000	YYR in chat is asking, not on Xbox?
4302000	4305000	If this remake is what we think it is,
4305000	4309000	they were already on Microsoft and Sony platforms some time ago.
4309000	4312000	Yeah, I'm trying to pull up the original.
4312000	4315000	Yeah, it's only listing Sony and Nintendo.
4315000	4319000	Oh, I thought it was on Microsoft too. That's weird.
4320000	4325000	No, the image is, and for those, for our people in chat,
4325000	4330000	I'll be more than happy to give a link to the tweet to them.
4330000	4334000	But you might, someone posted it called Ken Ziro,
4334000	4341000	so K-E-N-X-Y-R-O on August 19th if our listeners want to look for the tweet.
4342000	4346000	I'll link it in chat for our live people.
4346000	4348000	All right. Well, we'll see what comes to this.
4348000	4352000	I think looking forward to that Ubisoft forward event is a very good chance.
4352000	4355000	We'll hear a little more of this at that time.
4355000	4357000	In the meantime, in the meantime,
4357000	4361000	a few more stories before we get to the classic game of the week, starting with Loki.
4362000	4367000	Yes, this is kind of ridiculous, but I'm not a huge brand loyal person,
4367000	4372000	but apparently a lot of folks are really into Supreme
4372000	4375000	and their product lines and clothing lines.
4375000	4379000	Well, if you're really a huge fan of Supreme and a fan of Mortal Kombat,
4379000	4383000	you can get some horrible abomination that is a combination of those two
4383000	4388000	in the Supreme Mortal Kombat arcade cabinet from Arcade 1UP.
4388000	4393000	It has got Raiden ducked out in Supreme gear,
4393000	4397000	and it says Supreme on top instead of Mortal Kombat.
4398000	4400000	That's a bad idea.
4400000	4408000	It's also got Supreme, the stand at the bottom to raise it up as well.
4410000	4414000	Yeah, I don't think I would want that.
4414000	4418000	YYR is asking a very valid question in chat right now.
4418000	4420000	What is Supreme?
4421000	4424000	It's brand and it's terrible and boring.
4424000	4425000	I don't know.
4425000	4426000	It's like clothing.
4426000	4429000	It's really boring looking branding.
4429000	4434000	I mean, it honestly is like your branding sucks.
4437000	4441000	See, when I gave this a once over, I thought that it was like,
4441000	4444000	oh, they're coming out with another cabinet,
4444000	4446000	but Arcade 1UP already has one.
4446000	4450000	Okay, Supreme is an American skateboarding shop
4450000	4454000	and clothing brand established in New York City in 94.
4454000	4456000	The brand caters to skateboarding and hip hop cultures
4456000	4458000	as well as to youth culture in general.
4458000	4462000	The brand produces clothes and accessories and also manufactures skateboards.
4462000	4464000	So this might be where some of the disconnect is,
4464000	4468000	is that this is a brand catered towards a younger audience.
4468000	4472000	And let's be real, we're all in our late 30s and early 40s now here at OLR.
4472000	4475000	So these are clothes that probably don't even fit us.
4475000	4479000	So there's a little bit like, who is this really tart?
4479000	4481000	I mean, I get it.
4481000	4486000	But why would you want that on an arcade cabinet?
4486000	4488000	It just seems kind of silly.
4488000	4489000	Like, I don't know.
4489000	4493000	Like, I wouldn't want, you know.
4493000	4498000	I can't, I can't wait for the Calvin Klein, you know,
4498000	4501000	Prince of Persia machine to come out.
4501000	4504000	Yeah, like just like something like I wouldn't even like
4504000	4509000	if I'm going to get an arcade cabinet, you're going to you would want you would be.
4509000	4513000	I don't know, like it would be silly, like if they really wanted to go all out,
4513000	4517000	I think they should go, you know, double down on it and they should have like
4517000	4521000	reskin the actual characters in the game to be all wearing Supreme stuff.
4521000	4525000	That would be like kind of ridiculous enough for this cabinet.
4525000	4530000	But the fact that you're just putting like a new.
4530000	4533000	It's just it almost looks like a parody like on the outside.
4533000	4534000	I just don't see the point.
4534000	4539000	Let me be that guy and ask the devil a good question.
4539000	4542000	Isn't Mortal Kombat kind of that video game, though?
4542000	4545000	Isn't Mortal Kombat kind of that parody video game, though?
4545000	4548000	Like if any video game were to have all their characters,
4548000	4552000	like wouldn't Mortal Kombat be that game?
4552000	4556000	No, no, I don't think it would be.
4556000	4560000	Crystal Skies 80 in chat says there is a large crossover between Mortal Kombat
4560000	4562000	and the hip hop community.
4562000	4566000	And I OK, I have no doubt market research.
4566000	4571000	Yeah, but I think this could have very easily been a lot of different video games.
4571000	4575000	I would say maybe Mortal Kombat and Warner Brothers
4575000	4577000	was probably the first to answer the phone.
4577000	4582000	So. All right. Anyhow, let's move on.
4582000	4585000	Someone likes us.
4585000	4589000	All right. Let's move on and talk about control.
4589000	4594000	So last week on the program, we talked about how there was a report
4594000	4598000	that control would not be doing free upgrades, basically,
4598000	4600000	like if you own the PlayStation 4 version, too bad.
4600000	4603000	You had to buy it again if you wanted it on PlayStation 5.
4603000	4605000	Same thing in the Microsoft climate as well.
4605000	4609000	Well, this week, 505 Games kind of responded to this
4609000	4613000	and firmed their stance, basically, saying the following.
4613000	4616000	While it is challenging bringing any game to next gen platforms,
4616000	4620000	we quickly realized it was even more difficult to upgrade our current user base
4620000	4625000	to next gen with full parity across platforms with our year old game.
4625000	4629000	Every avenue we pursued, there was some form of blocker
4629000	4632000	and those blockers meant that at least one group of players
4632000	4636000	ended up being left out of the upgrade for various reasons.
4636000	4639000	As of today, we can't offer an upgrade to everyone
4639000	4643000	and leaving any one group out feels unfair.
4643000	4645000	Now, there's a couple of ways to take that comment
4645000	4649000	because I think a lot of people probably at first glance read that comment
4649000	4653000	and go, they're just blowing smoke up our ass. They don't want to do it.
4653000	4656000	But there's another part of me that reads this comment
4656000	4661000	and that goes, 505's throwing shade.
4661000	4665000	They're not making their target clear.
4665000	4672000	Somebody isn't playing nice and they're not willing to out the bitch, basically,
4672000	4675000	because probably the ramifications.
4675000	4678000	I can't imagine, though, who that would be that's not playing nice
4678000	4685000	because if you think about it, there's plenty of other third party games
4685000	4689000	that are offering these free upgrades to the next gen thing
4689000	4692000	and they're offering it as well, but only for this ultimate edition thing
4692000	4694000	that you have to repurchase.
4694000	4698000	I was going to say, there's probably some type of issue there
4698000	4701000	and that's what the articles I'm reading are theorizing too
4701000	4706000	is that it might have to do with you have the old version of the game,
4706000	4710000	that doesn't mean you get the ultimate version with everything on it for free.
4710000	4713000	So there might be a problem there.
4713000	4715000	They want people to maybe...
4715000	4717000	I'm not buying it, sorry.
4717000	4720000	Because I could get it if it was like, you know,
4720000	4722000	well, we want to do all the stuff for the ultimate version,
4722000	4726000	but because of that, we can't make the regular version and that's why.
4726000	4729000	For example, say they were trying to push something with the DLC
4729000	4734000	that technology-wise, they couldn't do it on the current generation systems.
4734000	4739000	It was just so amazing that they could only do it on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.
4739000	4744000	And that's why they're like, OK, well, this version we can only sell on the systems.
4744000	4748000	But you're creating the assets, you're creating the game already
4748000	4752000	for the other system and the current gen system.
4752000	4756000	But for whatever reason, like if you even own the DLC,
4756000	4762000	like you have part A and part B and then you're selling part A and B together now as well.
4762000	4767000	But for some reason, this one can go and be upgraded, but the other one can't.
4767000	4768000	That doesn't make any sense.
4768000	4773000	It's the same game, essentially, except one of them has the DLC bundled with it
4773000	4777000	and the other one, you buy it separately.
4777000	4780000	I don't understand it.
4780000	4784000	To me, this sounds like a whole lot of the Assassin's Creed issue where they're like,
4784000	4789000	oh, yeah, you know, creating female characters is just too hard.
4789000	4793000	We would have to create all this extra clothing to fit on the female characters.
4793000	4795000	It's impossible. We can't do it.
4795000	4798000	I think it's more of it's expensive to do this.
4798000	4802000	And we want to sell you this copy because we need to
4802000	4803000	recoup the cost.
4803000	4808000	We need to offset the cost to develop this new version is what it is.
4808000	4811000	It's ridiculous.
4811000	4816000	It's absolutely ridiculous that it even pulled this.
4816000	4818000	All right. Well, it is what it is.
4818000	4823000	They did so consider that if you're going to buy control, because I,
4823000	4827000	I still need to play that game, but I'll tell you, I'm just going to sit and wait,
4827000	4829000	at least until I'm not going to buy it now.
4829000	4832000	If they're not going to give a free upgrade, I'll wait for the PlayStation
4832000	4836000	five and Xbox one versions or I'm sorry, Xbox Series X versions and do it then.
4836000	4841000	Or even better, just wait for it to come on to games pass,
4841000	4845000	which is, you know, didn't they say it was going to come to Game Pass at some point?
4845000	4848000	I thought they announced it and then I don't know.
4848000	4850000	I could be making it up. There's a lot of games.
4850000	4853000	There's a lot of games that I thought were coming to Game Pass,
4853000	4857000	like Final Fantasy 13, like a year ago that still haven't.
4857000	4861000	So I don't know. All right. Anyhow, let's move on.
4861000	4864000	Let's let's go back to a simpler time there.
4864000	4866000	There wasn't really ultimate editions of games.
4866000	4869000	We might have got an HD edition years later.
4869000	4870000	Wink, wink. Right.
4870000	4874000	But there was no we didn't get the same game on the very next platform.
4874000	4877000	All right. Anyway, it's the classic game of the week.
4877000	4880000	I could have done that transition better, but oh, well, classic of the week.
4880000	4883000	So every week, dark soccer likes to step into the gaming vault
4883000	4887000	and find a game that she thinks, hey, you brats, check out this game,
4887000	4890000	because it's a class seek dark soccer.
4890000	4892000	What is the class line and go to an arcade?
4892000	4897000	I do want to warn the B roll tonight is only like two or three minutes.
4897000	4899000	So it's not going to cover the entire segment.
4899000	4903000	So if anyone needs a break and I should kill your camera, let me know.
4903000	4906000	All right. But it's the classic game of the week.
4906000	4909000	So dark soccer. What did you pick for us tonight?
4909000	4912000	I picked under defeat.
4912000	4917000	So it was a shooter game that was developed by Jireb,
4917000	4920000	released in Japanese arcades in 2005.
4920000	4924000	So it's an alternate reality during World War Two,
4924000	4928000	where you control German characters under the banner of the empire,
4928000	4930000	fighting the enemies called the Union,
4930000	4934000	the speak English and possess weapons that are patterned after real weapons.
4934000	4939000	So they're actually a patterned story after Allied and Axis powers.
4939000	4944000	So the there was a Dreamcast version released in 2006
4944000	4950000	and marketed as the last game for the system, although it actually was not.
4950000	4954000	But it wasn't really given great reviews, more like average,
4954000	4957000	because it's pretty, you know, pretty derivative.
4957000	4960000	You know, all shooters have been done,
4960000	4967000	but it did get a HD release for PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2002.
4967000	4970000	That was published by Rising Star Games.
4970000	4976000	It was updated to contain improved visuals, different control scheme options,
4976000	4980000	and new gameplay modes to adapt for the 16.9 display.
4980000	4986000	And of course, it was re-released in arcades cool enough as under defeat HD plus.
4986000	4989000	So with this game, you are a helicopter pilot
4989000	4995000	and you can rotate it kind of like Zero Gunner 2.
4995000	5000000	But most of the time, it's just very, you know, traditional
5000000	5003000	compared to a lot of the Toaplan games like Twin Cobra.
5003000	5008000	It does use 3D graphics and sort of a 2D setting with an angled perspective
5008000	5011000	to give things a little bit more depth.
5011000	5014000	But it's very, you know, it's very simple.
5014000	5017000	Simple, you know, machine gun, bomb button, that's it.
5017000	5019000	And of course, you've got some different things.
5019000	5022000	It's a very unique visual style for Shmups, I think,
5022000	5026000	like the kind of like tilted sort of view it has.
5026000	5029000	But the game plays like any other.
5029000	5032000	So you have three attacks, you've got your machine gun,
5032000	5034000	your bombs, and your options.
5034000	5039000	So if you hold down the fire button or the X button,
5039000	5042000	you're going to get a continuous stream of bullets with the machine gun.
5042000	5044000	This is your primary weapon.
5044000	5047000	And you start with three bombs, but you can accumulate up to six.
5047000	5049000	You get a full screen blast.
5049000	5051000	We all know how that happens in these games.
5051000	5055000	And then you'll get different weapon assist options
5055000	5058000	that will give you extra firepower.
5058000	5061000	And it'll cycle through depending on where you are in the game
5061000	5063000	and what your stages are.
5063000	5066000	Your helicopter can move in eight directions,
5066000	5071000	although your speed is fixed based on how the screen is scrolling.
5071000	5076000	You can have your left-right directions reversed in pilot style,
5076000	5081000	but it happens like in the game.
5081000	5085000	As far as the big thing that is,
5085000	5089000	I'd say its selling point with the original is your resolution mode.
5089000	5093000	So if you tap the R button on this, you'll get four different modes,
5093000	5098000	one that rotates the whole screen 90 degrees to the right.
5098000	5100000	You can also do it the other way.
5101000	5103000	If you were doing this at home, though,
5103000	5106000	you would have to have your TV on its side.
5106000	5109000	So having one of those rotating screens,
5109000	5112000	it really is kind of hard.
5112000	5120000	But at any rate, you've got a few different kind of weapons options.
5120000	5123000	You'll get the weapons option.
5123000	5128000	You have Vulcan machine gun, which is the same as your main gun.
5128000	5131000	It's a fast recharge, but weak in power.
5131000	5137000	You have a green cannon that's at eight moderately powerful salvos
5137000	5139000	that are fired one every second.
5139000	5141000	It can take out both small and medium.
5141000	5143000	It takes some helicopters with one shot.
5143000	5147000	It has a longer recharge and it has a shorter range than the rocket grenade.
5147000	5149000	And that's the last one, the rocket grenade,
5149000	5151000	which is a single powerful shot.
5151000	5154000	And it'll take out nearly every enemy in the game
5154000	5156000	and has blast radius damage.
5156000	5160000	Really good for bosses, but it has a long recharge period.
5161000	5165000	You also do get some point modifiers by multiplying your support.
5165000	5167000	Different multipliers get it go up.
5167000	5172000	You can get up to as large as 10,000 times modified.
5173000	5178000	As I was saying, though, it was released in Japanese arcades on October 27, 2005.
5178000	5182000	It had a soundtrack that was released in December.
5182000	5185000	The Dreamcast port came out March 23, 2006.
5187000	5193000	And it was announced basically five years after Sega said
5193000	5196000	that they were going to stop supporting the system.
5197000	5199000	The other games that came out after it, though,
5199000	5204000	were Triggerheart, Excellica, and Paris,
5204000	5207000	which might end up being the future games of the week.
5207000	5208000	We'll see.
5209000	5213000	But GRAM thought the game was a commercial success.
5213000	5217000	It sold through its first printing in one week.
5217000	5222000	It was basically their best-selling game since border down in 2003.
5222000	5225000	And they, of course, limited release
5225000	5229000	and had another limited edition with a pack-in CD.
5230000	5233000	It was different than the initial CD that came out.
5233000	5234000	And so since people were like,
5234000	5237000	we want more, we want more,
5237000	5241000	GREV did release the HD version of Under Defeat
5241000	5245000	for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in October 2011.
5245000	5248000	It was published by Rising Star Games.
5249000	5255000	And normally, a lot of the GREV games were Xbox 360 exclusives,
5255000	5259000	but they did go in with a PS3 port as well
5259000	5261000	in the digital storefronts that are.
5261000	5264000	So yeah, it's got all kinds of different modes in it.
5264000	5266000	I won't go into it for,
5266000	5269000	I know we have a lot of fans in there,
5269000	5275000	but it did, it was basically just considered to be,
5275000	5279000	you know, the perspectives on it were really novel,
5279000	5284000	but it was just considered to be fairly mediocre.
5284000	5286000	I mean, just like middle of the road for shooters,
5286000	5289000	like right above average for your shooter.
5289000	5293000	It got a C plus or maybe a B minus.
5294000	5298000	But it didn't have any inventive bullet patterns.
5298000	5301000	The scoring method was pretty, you know, cut and dried.
5301000	5306000	The controls were the same as most other ones out at the time.
5306000	5311000	So yeah, it was fairly average,
5311000	5313000	but it does have that novelty
5313000	5316000	of being a very late Dreamcast release.
5316000	5321000	So that's kind of fascinating how late this came out.
5321000	5325000	Yeah, and G Rev, I mean themselves,
5325000	5329000	G Rev has had some amazing shooters.
5329000	5333000	I mean, they've also, you know, done some puzzle games
5333000	5334000	and things like that.
5334000	5337000	But I mean, they also assisted on Gradius 5
5337000	5341000	and they worked with Yuichi Hiroshi,
5341000	5346000	who worked on Ikaruga on their game, Astrania.
5346000	5350000	So they've, there are no newbies to this.
5350000	5353000	They've done some fantastic games on here.
5353000	5357000	The last arcade game, though, was Under the Heat HD.
5357000	5363000	So I think that that also has, it should be important.
5363000	5365000	One of the more recent ones for the record, though, by the way,
5365000	5367000	was Darius first Chronicle Saviors,
5367000	5369000	which has been absolutely hilarious
5369000	5372000	to watch for their Sega themed add-ons.
5372000	5377000	So, but yeah, going back to the original topic, though,
5377000	5382000	it's absolutely, it's pretty, I'll give it that.
5382000	5385000	It's a pretty game, but it's novel
5385000	5388000	for its relation to Dreamcast release.
5388000	5390000	All right.
5390000	5392000	Well, thank you for bringing that game to our attention,
5392000	5394000	Dark Sakura.
5394000	5398000	It's a fun romp.
5398000	5401000	It's a fun romp.
5401000	5403000	Under Defeat is a classic game of the week,
5403000	5404000	if you want to look that up.
5404000	5405000	All right.
5405000	5407000	Or the, you know, you probably are going to have a hard time
5407000	5408000	finding that, well, no, you're not,
5408000	5410000	because Dreamcast games are pirated so easily.
5410000	5412000	Not that I would ever advocate piracy,
5412000	5413000	but let's just be real.
5413000	5415000	If you wanted to find it, it's pretty easy.
5415000	5419000	But these remakes that they did for like PS3 and stuff
5419000	5421000	are certainly worth your time as well,
5421000	5422000	if you want to check it out.
5422000	5424000	I mean, it's not the best shooter you'll ever play,
5424000	5429000	but it's a romp.
5429000	5430000	All right.
5430000	5433000	Anyway, thank you, Dark Sakura, as always.
5433000	5434000	Let's move on with our show.
5434000	5437000	We got some rapid fire news, some quick news bullet points
5437000	5439000	for tonight.
5439000	5441000	Loki, we'll start with you, I think.
5441000	5442000	Yeah.
5442000	5446000	So there was the whole DC Fan Fest thing that was going on.
5446000	5448000	There was a fan dome.
5448000	5450000	So there was lots of announcements
5450000	5453000	regarding DC properties, including a few games.
5453000	5455000	So we, of course, got confirmation.
5455000	5456000	Lots of movie trailers, too.
5456000	5459000	And that terrible Batman that's going to come out.
5459000	5463000	Can't we just have like a half a fun Batman movie?
5463000	5465000	Yeah, I don't know.
5465000	5466000	We'll see.
5466000	5468000	I have mixed feelings on the trailer,
5468000	5470000	but I thought it would be worse.
5470000	5471000	I'll put it that way.
5471000	5472000	But anyway, sorry.
5472000	5474000	But if you want to see our Discord,
5474000	5476000	this is a good chance for me to shout out the Discord,
5476000	5478000	vognetwork.com slash Discord.
5478000	5480000	I saw Tigerclaw and other people there dropping the trailers
5480000	5482000	that were released from that event
5482000	5485000	because there was the Zack Snyder kind of Justice League
5485000	5486000	got a thing.
5486000	5490000	Wonder Woman has a new trailer where you can actually kind of,
5490000	5492000	you can see Cheetah in it, finally.
5492000	5495000	And then there's other, Suicide Squad,
5495000	5498000	which I guess they're just pretending the last one didn't happen.
5498000	5499000	I don't know what they're doing.
5499000	5501000	There's another one with like 500 people.
5501000	5505000	It's technically, they're not pretending it didn't happen.
5505000	5507000	It has different people in it.
5507000	5509000	Oh, I thought they just were, okay.
5509000	5513000	It's not just different people.
5513000	5515000	It's 500 different people in that movie.
5515000	5517000	It's so many.
5517000	5518000	It looks great, though.
5518000	5519000	It looks fantastic.
5519000	5521000	So I am very excited about that.
5521000	5523000	Anyways, speaking of Suicide Squad, though,
5523000	5525000	there is a game that's going to be coming out as well
5525000	5528000	that looks like it has some of the similar team members in it as well.
5528000	5533000	And that is Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League.
5533000	5535000	It's going to be coming out in 2022.
5535000	5539000	It looks fantastic, though.
5539000	5543000	They showed off Harley Quinn, King Shark, Deadshot,
5543000	5545000	and Captain Boomerang.
5545000	5549000	But it's kind of teased right now,
5549000	5551000	but it looks like that for some reason,
5551000	5555000	some of the Justice League are going to be kind of villains in the game.
5555000	5559000	Like Superman has shown to be killing somebody in there.
5559000	5562000	So that's, I thought it may have been like Bizarro.
5562000	5564000	Like we're going for injustice.
5564000	5565000	Sort of, yeah.
5565000	5566000	Sort of like that.
5566000	5568000	So it's interesting.
5568000	5571000	But yeah, I'm looking forward to that when that comes out.
5571000	5572000	So they teased that a little bit.
5572000	5574000	And then more, sooner than that, of course,
5574000	5576000	we're going to be getting a brand new game
5576000	5580000	from Warner Brothers Montreal, which is Gotham Knights.
5580000	5583000	And that, of course, follows.
5583000	5589000	I guess it's going to be similar to like the Batman Arkham Origins game.
5589000	5594000	But it's following, of course, Batgirl, Nightwing, Red Hood, and Robin.
5594000	5598000	And yeah, it looks interesting.
5598000	5600000	That's going to be coming out in 2021.
5600000	5601000	That looks pretty cool.
5601000	5602000	Yeah.
5602000	5603000	Yeah.
5603000	5604000	Yeah.
5604000	5608000	And then this year, of course, we've got a brand new Call of Duty game coming out.
5608000	5611000	So we have Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War.
5611000	5614000	And they released a trailer for that as well.
5614000	5620000	Or I should say like a teaser that apparently was,
5620000	5623000	I think, coming from the end of an ARG that they did.
5623000	5626000	And supposedly, they're going to be announcing more details
5626000	5627000	later this week about the game.
5627000	5631000	But they showed a little teaser kind of announcing the title of the game
5631000	5632000	and everything.
5632000	5635000	So it's interesting.
5635000	5638000	I like the Black Ops game, so I might have to check it out.
5638000	5640000	But we'll see.
5640000	5641000	All right.
5641000	5642000	And as Jason said in the intro,
5642000	5644000	you're the only one that knows about those games, really.
5644000	5648000	So I haven't played them in a long time because it's just like they've
5648000	5649000	been shoehorning.
5649000	5651000	I guess the battle royale stuff is supposed to be pretty good.
5651000	5653000	But I haven't played in a long time.
5653000	5656000	And it's not I don't like jumping into it by myself.
5656000	5660000	I like playing with friends, probably because I beat the crap out of them.
5660000	5663000	But I just haven't played in a long time.
5663000	5667000	So it's hard for me to jump back into like a battle royale game.
5667000	5669000	Like if I had them to play with, I probably would.
5669000	5672000	But yeah, I don't know.
5672000	5673000	All right.
5673000	5675000	The single player campaigns, I just didn't pick up the last one.
5675000	5677000	So I didn't play the single player campaign on that.
5677000	5680000	But I do like the single player campaigns.
5680000	5681000	All right.
5681000	5684000	Well, moving over to a series that has a lot,
5684000	5688000	a lot of games across Sony and Nintendo,
5688000	5689000	they don't release these.
5689000	5691000	Oh, no, they do sometimes on Microsoft.
5691000	5692000	I feel like there's just not as many.
5692000	5694000	But it's the Arcade Archives.
5694000	5697000	Hamster is the organization between Arcade Archives
5697000	5700000	and they have revealed, they have their own streams they do
5700000	5702000	called Arcade Archiver.
5702000	5703000	There's so many of these.
5703000	5705000	There's like 100 of them on Switch.
5705000	5707000	But anyway, they are going to be doing some more games
5707000	5711000	that will be coming to the Arcade Archives.
5711000	5714000	This was a deal with Konami, it sounds like.
5714000	5716000	Contra is going to be coming out,
5716000	5721000	as well as Gradius II and Super Cobra for Switch releases.
5721000	5723000	And then one other outside Konami release
5723000	5726000	that's still pretty exciting, Super Dodgeball,
5726000	5728000	the Kunio-kun classic, the arcade version.
5728000	5731000	That's going to be awesome because that was a good game.
5731000	5734000	That will be coming out as well in the Arcade Archive collection.
5734000	5735000	But we don't know when.
5735000	5737000	Just soon, trademark.
5737000	5741000	Happening right now, a Nintendo Switch eShop sale.
5741000	5744000	Yes, this is newsworthy because Nintendo games never go on sale.
5744000	5750000	So, Luigi's Mansion 3 is now down from $60 to $42.
5750000	5754000	So is Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games down $60 to $40.
5754000	5758000	Some other games on some deep cut sale on this Nintendo Switch.
5758000	5760000	Burnout Paradise Remastered, $35.
5760000	5762000	Overwatch, $20.
5762000	5765000	Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled, $24.
5765000	5769000	Diablo III Eternal Collection, $30.
5769000	5772000	That's the one that includes Necromancer because it was on the Switch.
5772000	5775000	There's a lot of indie games on sale as well through August 30th.
5775000	5778000	Somebody was telling me there's over like 500 games on the indie sale.
5778000	5781000	But there's just so much to wade through on the Switch.
5781000	5783000	It can be a little bit daunting.
5783000	5784000	A few of the highlights.
5784000	5786000	Exit the Gungeon, $7.
5786000	5788000	Ori and the Blind Forest, $14.
5788000	5791000	Hotline Miami, $8.74.
5791000	5794000	That all again on Nintendo Switch.
5794000	5797000	eShop sale, Dark Sakura.
5798000	5803000	Well, we have the, blah, I can't make words happen.
5803000	5808000	The Astro City Mini has a release date for December 17th in Japan.
5808000	5810000	And they've announced more titles for it.
5810000	5820000	So, originally we had Alien Syndrome, Alien Storm, Altered Beast, Columns 2, The Voyage Through Time, Dark Edge, Fantasy Zone, yay!
5820000	5826000	Golden Axe, Golden Axe, The Revenge of Death Adder, Puzzle in Action, Tant R, and Virtua Fighter.
5826000	5831000	Now added to the list is Bonanza Brothers, Columns, Cotton, yes, I love Cotton.
5831000	5834000	Cyber Police eSwat, Puyo Puyo.
5834000	5837000	I mean, there's like a bunch of good games on here I love already.
5837000	5844000	Puzzle in Action, Ichidan R, Gain Ground, Shadow Dancer, another great game.
5844000	5849000	Shinobi, Wonder Boy, Wonder Boy in Monsterland, and Wonder Boy 3, Monster Lair.
5849000	5854000	So, I have some excitement going on in my heart for this one.
5854000	5860000	And the system is going to be roughly 40 bucks.
5860000	5863000	I think it's more than that.
5863000	5866000	The controller, sorry, is going to be 40 bucks.
5866000	5868000	Yeah, I was going to say it's like 120 or something.
5868000	5872000	Yeah, the system is going to be actually more like 130, but yeah.
5872000	5881000	And then they've got the little stand that goes with it that makes it look like a full Sega Astro City instead of just kind of like a bar top, which there was never a bar top Astro City.
5882000	5885000	But, yeah, kind of.
5885000	5888000	And it becomes a little store as well, so it's pretty cool.
5888000	5891000	This is absolutely a do want situation.
5891000	5903000	And anyway, the other Harmonix game that was announced, Fusor, has 12 more songs that were added to the roster.
5903000	5906000	So it's going to launch with more than 100 songs.
5907000	5916000	New games announced are Aja's Take On Me, Ace of Base The Sign, Amy Winehouse Rehab, Basement Jax, Where's Your Head At? I love Basement Jax.
5916000	5922000	Becky G with Natty Natasha's Tin Pajama? I don't know the song.
5922000	5928000	Benny Benassi presents The Biz Satisfaction, Childish Gambino, Summertime Magic.
5928000	5930000	I'll just list the rest of them.
5930000	5933000	GDFR, The Killer's The Man.
5934000	5938000	Jurgle Steve and Pay, the new Manuah song.
5938000	5939000	Yeah, I remember the song.
5939000	5947000	Which for some fucking reason has been stuck in my head for a solid two weeks and I've been making up lyrics to it to the cat.
5947000	5953000	We have Fortnangel, PVD Remix 09 and Sean Paul's Temperature.
5953000	5960000	It's due to be out on PS4, Xbox One, Switch and PC via Steam later on.
5960000	5961000	Aziz Fall.
5961000	5962000	That's a heck of a list.
5962000	5963000	All right.
5963000	5964000	Yeah, it is.
5964000	5969000	Well, let's travel around the world and check out some games that are going to be coming out a little sooner than this fall.
5969000	5970000	Yeah.
5970000	5975000	So this week we've got Cinders coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5975000	5985000	We have, I'm going to try not to butcher this, Kendagawa Jet Girls on PC and PlayStation 4.
5985000	5993000	Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered Edition coming out on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, iOS and Android.
5993000	5999000	The Legend of Heroes, Hajimari no Kiseki.
5999000	6001000	That's on PlayStation 4.
6001000	6005000	Moon Remix RPG Adventure on Nintendo Switch.
6005000	6012000	Surgeon Simulator 2 on PC and Tell Me Why Chapter 1.
6012000	6024000	And then, of course, we also have on towards the end of the week here, Captain Tsubasa Rise of the New Champions on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
6024000	6030000	Immortal Realms Vampire Wars on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6030000	6033000	Jump Force Deluxe Edition on Nintendo Switch.
6033000	6038000	Madden NFL 21 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6038000	6043000	Project Cars 3 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6043000	6047000	Wasteland 3 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6047000	6056000	And last but not least, Windbound on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and some console called Stadia.
6056000	6062000	Why are they doing a Captain Tsubasa game 10 years after the last one?
6062000	6064000	Why not?
6064000	6066000	I mean, the manga has been out since 1981.
6066000	6068000	It's a soccer game.
6068000	6073000	Yeah, but sometimes they revive old stuff for, you know, just how they do it.
6073000	6075000	I was just a little surprised. That's all.
6075000	6078000	All right, let's travel to Japan and check out some releases over there.
6078000	6081000	And I got to say, we've had a couple slow weeks in Japan.
6081000	6083000	That's not the case this week.
6083000	6086000	We're getting a backlog kind of unloaded on us this week.
6086000	6090000	So Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles is released on the Switch this week in Japan.
6090000	6092000	That's going to be a big one because I know that's here.
6092000	6094000	It'll be a big deal, too.
6094000	6100000	The Captain Tsubasa also released Rise of New Champions, also releasing in Japan this week on the 27th.
6100000	6105000	A game called Giraffe and Annika is coming out this week on the Switch.
6105000	6109000	It's kind of like cartoony, kind of looks like one of those level five games at first glance,
6109000	6113000	but I don't think it's like comic book style cut scenes and things like that.
6113000	6120000	And then also in Japan, we have Shinobi Koi Utsutsu for Nintendo Switch.
6120000	6124000	I don't think that is to be confused with the popular Sega series of games.
6124000	6128000	It looks like it's based off Ninja School.
6128000	6133000	That's what it is. It's kind of one of those mangas about schools, but it's Ninja School.
6133000	6141000	Also a game called Konosuba, God's blessing on this wonderful world, Labyrinth of Hope and the Gathering of Adventurers Plus.
6141000	6145000	That is the fucking title of this game.
6145000	6149000	Anyway, it looks like it's kind of like a redo of an earlier game.
6149000	6153000	That's why they call it Plus, but it has like a new dungeon, new monsters.
6153000	6158000	It's kind of like a dungeon crawler, but like first person a little bit.
6158000	6161000	Let's see, Forager, also on the Switch this week.
6161000	6169000	No Straight Roads, Urugashi no Naku Koro Nihu comes out this week as well.
6169000	6172000	So very busy. That's just the Switch.
6172000	6176000	If I go to the PlayStation 4, we're going to see a lot of those similar titles.
6176000	6180000	Captain Tsubasa, The Legend of Heroes, Hajimari no Kisuke is out as well.
6180000	6184000	Kiss Trilogy comes out in a regular and premium edition this week.
6184000	6187000	And Giraffe and Annika also on PlayStation 4.
6187000	6190000	MotoGP20 is there as well this week.
6190000	6197000	And Terminator Resistance and The Legend of Heroes, Hajimari no Kisuke and that same title.
6197000	6199000	I'll say it one more time on the PlayStation 4.
6199000	6205000	Konosuba, God's blessing on this wonderful world, Labyrinth of Hope and the Gathering of Adventurers Plus.
6206000	6211000	That was the alternate name for this podcast actually at one point.
6211000	6215000	I just like that Giraffe and Annika has a musical mayhem edition.
6215000	6216000	That sounds like fun.
6216000	6219000	I just would play a game called Musical Mayhem.
6219000	6221000	What was that game?
6221000	6225000	Eternal Sonata, remember that RPG they made out of music?
6225000	6228000	Where the hell did that game go? That was a cool game.
6228000	6229000	Alright, anyway.
6229000	6230000	I think I have it.
6230000	6234000	It deserves a redo, I don't know.
6234000	6235000	Alright, anyway.
6235000	6236000	Let's move on.
6236000	6241000	By the way, just a quick programming note for those of you that have followed OLR for a long time.
6241000	6244000	You might be expecting us to do the mailbag right here because we usually do.
6244000	6246000	No, after I do mine.
6246000	6247000	No, I know.
6247000	6250000	We're going to move the mailbag to the end of the show.
6250000	6251000	Programming note.
6251000	6257000	But I haven't even done my part for us to announce mailbag which comes after IT European releases.
6257000	6258000	Yes, that is very true.
6258000	6260000	There is that as well.
6261000	6262000	Got it.
6262000	6263000	Slow down.
6263000	6265000	No, I'm fast.
6265000	6267000	Girl, catch your wig.
6267000	6268000	Anyway.
6268000	6277000	On the 24th in the UK, we have Street Power Football which is real football and not American football.
6277000	6284000	We have Descenders on August 24th and also No Straight Roads.
6284000	6288000	On the 26th, Gear Club Unlimited 2 Tracks edition.
6289000	6291000	Gay Roads only.
6293000	6296000	And then coming out on the 27th is a horde of things.
6296000	6314000	The Sojourn, Project Cars 3, Jump Force Deluxe Edition, Madden NFL 21, Dead Cells Prisoner's Edition, Captain Tsubasa Rise of New Champions, Wasteland 3, Immortal Realms Vampire Wars, Nexomon Extinction.
6314000	6316000	And that is it.
6316000	6319000	Not yet for the full month but those will come next week.
6320000	6321000	Alright.
6321000	6323000	Thing I said about the mailbag, insert it here.
6323000	6324000	We'll get to that.
6324000	6326000	We're merging it with the listener roundtable.
6326000	6328000	So it makes more sense to be there.
6328000	6330000	Alright, moving on.
6330000	6332000	Let's get to some more stories, Loki.
6333000	6334000	Alright.
6334000	6342000	So we should have seen this coming even though they promised that this wouldn't happen but can you really trust Facebook?
6342000	6343000	You can't.
6343000	6348000	Well, I can't believe I'm going to defend Facebook.
6348000	6351000	But Facebook did not say this.
6351000	6353000	This would never happen.
6353000	6360000	The person who started Oculus, who hasn't been with Oculus for a long time, had that to say.
6360000	6363000	We knew this was going to happen eventually.
6363000	6365000	Facebook still sucks, don't get me wrong.
6365000	6371000	But I feel like we should hate them for the right reasons and not make up new ones.
6371000	6372000	Yes.
6372000	6378000	So apparently, starting in October, you're going to have to log into...
6378000	6386000	In order to be able to use your Oculus to, I guess, access your Oculus account, you're going to need to log in with a Facebook account.
6386000	6394000	And apparently, if you are a current user of the Oculus and already have an Oculus account,
6394000	6400000	you will need to link it with a Facebook account within the next two years to maintain the full functionality of your system.
6400000	6404000	So after January 1st, 2023 is when that's going to go into effect.
6404000	6407000	I'm not surprised.
6407000	6416000	I don't know why we need to do it, but I'm sure that tracking your activities is probably part of it.
6416000	6425000	Because Facebook is going to want to show elements of your newsfeed in VR and it is only a matter of time before...
6425000	6429000	And this whole COVID situation is only accelerating this.
6429000	6432000	What did I say when Facebook bought Oculus in the first place?
6432000	6438000	They want to put more live events and event-type experiences, not just games, but the others.
6438000	6442000	Remember, there's other stuff that Oculus can do, concerts and things like that.
6442000	6446000	Facebook wants to push, push, push that on your Oculus.
6446000	6452000	And the only way they're going to know the type of stuff you like is for them to track all of the shit you do on Facebook.
6452000	6454000	That's what it is.
6454000	6456000	I can't wait to get some really weird ads.
6456000	6458000	Fuck Facebook.
6458000	6460000	Let me make that very clear.
6460000	6462000	Fuck Facebook.
6462000	6465000	But that's what they're doing.
6465000	6469000	Since I already own an Oculus Rift, it's no big deal.
6469000	6474000	I already have a Facebook account and I already get tons of ads as it is.
6474000	6483000	I don't really care, but maybe if you haven't purchased a VR device, you might think twice about what you purchased.
6483000	6489000	If it's a big deal to you, I mean, certainly that's a factor, but I don't know.
6489000	6491000	It's kind of too late for me.
6491000	6493000	So what am I going to do?
6493000	6495000	Bobby does want to say this.
6495000	6498000	To be fair, Palmer's words were exactly,
6498000	6503000	you will never need a Facebook account to use your Oculus Rift.
6503000	6506000	Well, gotcha, gal. They don't make Oculus Rift anymore.
6506000	6509000	It's Rift S and the Quest.
6509000	6511000	Well, true.
6511000	6513000	He lied.
6513000	6515000	Technically true.
6515000	6521000	But do you need to log into your Oculus account to be able to use stuff through Steam?
6521000	6525000	I can't remember if they've changed that now to where you have to log into that.
6525000	6531000	I know that, because I tend to purchase a lot of my stuff not through the Oculus Rift, just through Steam VR,
6531000	6534000	because I can get better discounts on that stuff.
6534000	6538000	So I'm curious if that is going to prevent me from doing that stuff.
6538000	6541000	I would think not, but you never know.
6542000	6547000	Bobby says no, but you have to have the Oculus account to do setup on your device.
6547000	6549000	Well, there you go.
6551000	6560000	Well, I mean, I can think of no better advertisement for the HTC Vive than what Oculus just did this week, as far as I'm concerned.
6560000	6563000	I have not taken the leap into VR on the PC yet.
6563000	6566000	I haven't really just found that thing.
6566000	6570000	I have that baby's first VR, the PlayStation VR.
6570000	6572000	It works great.
6572000	6577000	It does what I need to do and plays enough of the games I want to play, so I haven't felt the need to go up to PC yet.
6577000	6584000	But if that were to happen in the next few years, say right around the time this is going to end up mandatory next year anyway,
6584000	6589000	I think this just sold me an HTC Vive.
6590000	6592000	For sure, yeah.
6592000	6594000	Not me.
6594000	6597000	If you're not going to any of the platforms.
6597000	6599000	I'm not getting any of them.
6599000	6600000	Well, you know.
6600000	6602000	I get to save that money.
6602000	6605000	But I don't know if I'm going to be getting it anytime soon.
6605000	6608000	I mean, honestly, I don't VR enough.
6608000	6609000	I actually think we have one more.
6609000	6610000	Yeah.
6610000	6611000	All right.
6611000	6613000	Anyway, let's move on.
6613000	6616000	Let's talk about Twitch as a platform again.
6616000	6619000	But this one's a little better than the...
6619000	6622000	And again, the last story we talked about, it wasn't even Twitch's fault.
6622000	6628000	Twitch's was just the vehicle for some shady practice.
6628000	6630000	But anyway, this is something Twitch is doing.
6630000	6633000	It's kind of making some tweaks to Twitch drops.
6633000	6638000	So, you know, Twitch drops are when you watch a feed and you get drops.
6638000	6646000	Like, for example, a big, big example of this was when Riot Games started using the drops for Valorant, right?
6646000	6649000	So if you watched other people play it, you might get the key for yourself.
6649000	6651000	Yeah, it didn't go...
6651000	6653000	Like, people abused the shit out of that system, right?
6653000	6657000	Running like a 24 hour, just watch me and get the drops thing.
6657000	6658000	So guess what?
6658000	6661000	Twitch is revisiting the drop system a little bit.
6661000	6665000	I got to say, this is a smart response in my opinion.
6666000	6672000	Developers, not Twitch, but developers are now being given more control over how rewards are handed out.
6672000	6682000	So streamers may have to complete certain in-game events like killing a boss, finding an item, essentially achievement.
6682000	6686000	Achievement unlocked for you and you and you and you.
6686000	6689000	That's what Twitch drops might be turning into a little bit.
6689000	6692000	You get an achievement and you get an achievement.
6692000	6696000	Look under your chair. You get an achievement. We all get achievements.
6696000	6697000	Alright, anyway.
6697000	6698000	Yay!
6698000	6702000	So that is something they're looking to build that in.
6702000	6708000	So the unlock embeds are going to be linked to Twitch's Enhanced Experiences API.
6708000	6716000	So rewards could be when somebody completes a level or let's say you're the last person standing in something like Fall Guys or another Battle Royale game.
6716000	6718000	That would be a possibility.
6718000	6721000	So developers can kind of do this as they see fit.
6721000	6730000	And I think that's a great idea because this means if you're going to run a 24-7 stream, you're going to have to actively be playing the game in order to get the drops.
6730000	6734000	And you're going to have to be really aware of that.
6734000	6736000	And I think that's pretty cool.
6736000	6745000	So anyway, looking forward to seeing how developers embed that in their games later on as they choose to do so.
6746000	6756000	Dark Tetsuya says Rogue Company does the Twitch drops thing too. Tell me more. Is that Rogue Legacy 2 or what are they doing?
6756000	6761000	I'd be curious to know how that is being added.
6761000	6766000	And the chat room is noticing right now that Stella has joined Loki on camera there.
6766000	6768000	Chilling out on Loki's shoulder there.
6768000	6771000	Yeah, we love to see Stella on air. It's lovely.
6771000	6772000	Alright.
6772000	6775000	Min just kind of pissed off that I locked her out.
6775000	6780000	I think Alan either is leaving or just got back and Mr. Smoosh is going wild. Oh, he's on his way out.
6780000	6783000	So Mr. Smoosh is like, wait, before you go, give me more food.
6783000	6784000	Smooshy.
6784000	6786000	Alright, let's move on.
6786000	6790000	Dark Stalker, I think you said you had to go a little early tonight.
6790000	6791000	I do.
6791000	6795000	I want to squeeze in one more story before you do so, okay?
6795000	6796000	I guess.
6796000	6801000	So at any rate, I really should be playing this.
6801000	6803000	One of my friends have been going nuts about it.
6803000	6811000	But Fall Guys, they have started a Twitter branding like bidding war.
6811000	6813000	Sorry for charity.
6813000	6815000	And I love the caption on this one.
6815000	6820000	It's got this little pink dude wearing a shirt that says, ask me about my butthole.
6820000	6822000	Oh, did that.
6822000	6824000	It's a bidet company. Did they win?
6824000	6825000	I don't know.
6825000	6827000	It's just the picture that they use. I think it's great.
6827000	6829000	Yeah, it's great.
6829000	6835000	Anyway, they're doing a two week Battle of the Brands event.
6835000	6843000	And the brand that donates the most to the charity special effect would get Italian.
6843000	6848000	Right now their bidding has gone over 130,000.
6848000	6849000	Wow.
6849000	6854000	Yeah, there are all kinds of just...
6854000	6857000	Hilarity is ensuing, I'll just let you know.
6857000	6868000	But it'll be good to have, you know, have that marketing and branding go into something good.
6868000	6870000	You know, have that go in.
6870000	6878000	So right now, one of the highest bidders at the time was the Warframe developers did 20,000.
6878000	6883000	And then bisect hosting went to 38,880.
6883000	6889000	And then the new one came up with Sidemen.
6889000	6892000	They are, they're going through it.
6892000	6894000	They bumped it up to 40,000.
6894000	6900000	And then Tushy Bidet, $40,000 and one cent.
6900000	6903000	And that's where ask me about my butthole came from.
6903000	6904000	Yep.
6904000	6912000	And then after that, though, after more fun bidding, G2 Esports went up to $130,003.
6912000	6913000	Wow.
6913000	6916000	That's on the second day.
6916000	6919000	So we're about to see this blow up.
6919000	6921000	Well, and there's been interesting alliances made too.
6921000	6926000	Like Ninja teamed up with somebody else and they made like a COVID or something.
6926000	6928000	So it's pretty cool.
6928000	6929000	I hope the bidet company wins.
6929000	6930000	I really do.
6930000	6933000	But I think it's great that it's for charity.
6933000	6941000	And especially when you have a game and a developer like the folks behind Fall Guys, like this is, you know, they're all the rage right now.
6941000	6943000	They're all, they're one of the top games on Twitch.
6943000	6947000	They have this peak popularity going on right now and they're riding that wave.
6947000	6950000	And like everybody wants to be a part of it because it is so popular.
6950000	6959000	The fact that they're riding that wave for charity when Burger King probably called them already offering them $5 to put the skin in the game.
6959000	6965000	I think it's, I think it's pretty cool that they're using this as a way to generate money for charity.
6965000	6967000	So, you know, kudos to them.
6967000	6969000	And I, you know, Fall Guys is Dark Soccer.
6969000	6970000	You absolutely should check it out.
6970000	6974000	I think one of the great things about it is it's a game you can really play in small bites.
6974000	6978000	Because, yes, it's a battle royale kind of game, but it's not a shooty shooty bang bang.
6978000	6979000	It's a platformer.
6979000	6981000	So it's it plays a lot differently.
6981000	6987000	And it's something where it's like you can play it and you might be out of it in 30 seconds and like, oh, well, I guess that's enough for today.
6987000	6991000	Or, you know, God damn it, I'm going to play until I get the fucking crown.
6991000	6994000	And then you play for eight days straight like that one streamer did.
6994000	6996000	Oh, hell no.
6996000	7000000	I don't think it was really like it wasn't like twenty four seven.
7000000	7006000	But I remember there was some clip floating around to some guy who finally won a match after like eight days.
7006000	7010000	And the whole Internet was so excited.
7010000	7014000	Yeah. And they were they were giving him shade too on the actual official Twitter.
7014000	7017000	I think it was giving him shade on it as well. So that's kind of funny.
7017000	7024000	Yeah. OK. So I went ahead and put Fall Guys in my my wish list on Steam.
7024000	7027000	So, yay. Oh, I'm putting it in there now.
7027000	7034000	So act. Oh, I think I think this is brilliant. Act Def says it's like the Mario Party mini games, but with more people.
7034000	7038000	That's a damn good way of putting it. That is a damn good way of putting it.
7038000	7045000	Marissa Meisel in chat. Hello, my dear, says I love a fall, fall, fall, gaze, fall, guys.
7045000	7055000	And usually, well, that's when me and Delvin get on stream and play fall guys together and start screaming.
7055000	7062000	That's fall gaze. I love fall guys. And usually games like that stress me out too much.
7062000	7068000	This is just silly fun in my wish list. Why are you letting me put you on my wish list?
7068000	7072000	I'm Dijerama says if you do have it for me.
7072000	7077000	Well, if you have played PlayStation four and you have PlayStation Plus, it's free on PS Plus right now.
7077000	7083000	So you wouldn't even have to write the way you just did. That was iconic.
7083000	7089000	You sat up in your seat, flicked your hair and went, bitch. Yeah.
7089000	7094000	But I was like right now. So this isn't like a permanent thing. It's going to go back to pay.
7094000	7098000	Yeah. It's only for this month. So you don't have a lot of time left. Yeah.
7098000	7105000	And I really need to get back into the steamy stuff so that I can stream it a little bit better.
7105000	7111000	Yeah. So. All right. Well, before we say goodbye, goodbye to you, Dark Sakura.
7111000	7116000	Do you have any final thoughts or anything for our audience tonight?
7116000	7121000	I want big suggestions. All right. I want to see some big suggestions.
7121000	7128000	What kind of wig do you think I should get next? Because I'm going to be weeding out some wigs.
7128000	7132000	And if some of y'all want Jamie wigs, I will clean those bitches and send them to you.
7132000	7137000	I want to see and hear me out, please. I want to see a wig from the wig party,
7137000	7145000	meaning like eighteen hundreds sign in, you know, or I guess seventeen hundreds sign in the Declaration of Independence Realness.
7145000	7148000	Do I look like I have time to powder a wig?
7148000	7154000	It is. It is. I will say Annie Lennox pulled that type of look off beautifully in one of her music videos.
7154000	7159000	So she did the one for Y, right? Yeah. I think it was Y or maybe walking on broken glass.
7159000	7164000	Walking on broken glass was the one. Yeah. So I love Annie Lennox.
7164000	7170000	She is a goddess and a diva. Any decent person does.
7171000	7175000	I don't know how else to put it. Like, there's just certain people where it's like, who?
7175000	7179000	Who on earth would hate this person? And Annie Lennox is one of them. Of course, I know.
7179000	7184000	I'm just inviting somebody in chat to say I'm not a fan. Well, you can keep your wrong opinion.
7184000	7190000	Yeah. Exactly. If you if you're not an Annie Lennox fan, how about you just shut up?
7190000	7196000	Just how about you just shut up? Look, every gamer has a voice, but not you.
7196000	7202000	Actually, I do want to bring up one more little thing, and I don't really know if y'all talked about it last week, but it just was a cute thing.
7202000	7209000	Sure. Is that Taiwanese IKEA catalog done all in Animal Crossing?
7209000	7215000	I don't think we ended up addressing that. No, it is cute as hell.
7215000	7220000	And I really want it. But I just think that it's something that made me just happy to see.
7220000	7232000	And I'll post the link to it in the chat room. But but y'all look up the Taiwanese IKEA Animal Crossing book.
7232000	7238000	It's super adorable. They did a really great job trying to make things match up.
7238000	7244000	They even have captions and everything. The scroll bar on Twitch is perfection right now.
7244000	7248000	It just scrolled that story by on the bottom as you're talking about it. Perfect.
7248000	7254000	Well, yeah, I that thing is all this thing is like all automated, too.
7254000	7258000	So it's pretty, pretty stunning. Awesome. That's pretty sweet.
7258000	7262000	So, yeah, there you go. It's it's it's adorable. Look at the adorable things.
7262000	7267000	And, you know, hey, if any of y'all is still playing Animal Crossing, hit me up for my friend code.
7267000	7271000	If you don't have it, I think I'm ready. When are we doing our Animal Crossing show?
7271000	7273000	When are we doing our Animal Crossing lounge radio?
7273000	7282000	I need to I need to figure out my streaming set up because it I think it's actually more just because my Mac is an older Mac.
7282000	7287000	I'll stream on and you just join me on Discord like you do now. And we'll I'll go to your town or something.
7287000	7290000	You can show that off. All right. We'll do it. We'll do it.
7290000	7295000	Animal Crossing lounge radio coming soon to Vogue on a on a completely irregular schedule,
7295000	7299000	on a completely when we feel like it schedule because that's the only way it's going to fly.
7299000	7303000	So so I will I will wish you all well.
7303000	7309000	Wear your mask. Social distance. Be safe.
7309000	7313000	Be careful. Be healthy. And I hope to see you all next week.
7313000	7317000	All right. We'll see you next time. Dark soccer. Have a great night. Later, taters.
7317000	7321000	Bye bye. And don't forget to wash your hands. Very good. Very good.
7321000	7325000	Do the hand washing. Yeah. All right. All right.
7325000	7329000	So dark soccer is out. Let me fix the cameras there. All right.
7329000	7333000	Let's move on. We have just a few more stories for you guys that we need to get to the listener roundtable.
7333000	7337000	So Loki with a follow up to some big stuff from last week.
7337000	7343000	Yeah. Let's talk about Epic and Apple. So there's still a lot of drama there, unfortunately.
7343000	7348000	So, of course, you may remember last week, Fortnite was taken up.
7348000	7354000	Oh, someone wants to get down. Oh, Stella was like, you're talking about this bullshit.
7354000	7359000	I'm out. It's like, nope.
7359000	7364000	Draw the line here. OK. If if blessed, sure.
7364000	7368000	Me, wherever. Sure. Me, the cat. Maybe we're still with us. That would have been sure.
7368000	7374000	Me's opportunity to just poo on the floor. Thank goodness she doesn't do that.
7374000	7381000	Anyways. So apparently. So you may remember that, you know, Fortnite was taken off of the app,
7381000	7386000	the iOS store and the Android store. I'm sorry, Google Play Store.
7386000	7392000	And of course, there's a lawsuit against Apple about the whole thing as well.
7392000	7396000	So kind of moving forward with that,
7396000	7403000	shortly after that, Epic's developer tools have been removed as well for Fortnite.
7403000	7410000	And that's also restricted access to make updates as well for Unreal Engine.
7410000	7419000	And so that's caused a lot of problems. So, of course, Epic has asked the court to prevent Apple from doing that.
7419000	7428000	And they filed an injunction for that. But not sure where that so far that hasn't been revoked yet.
7428000	7436000	So we'll have to see if they restore their access to that. But right now, they haven't done anything.
7436000	7441000	It's almost as if you play with fire and you might get burned. Exactly.
7441000	7448000	So then, of course, now, because they filed this whole lawsuit, all this stuff is now public information.
7448000	7453000	And so we get to see some of the details about how we got to this point in the first place.
7453000	7464000	So it appears that originally there was Tim Sweeney had reached out to Apple execs to try to let his company bypass their payment system.
7464000	7471000	And they said no. And you put that way nicer than he did.
7471000	7478000	He basically said, well, I'm going to do it anyways. And they're like, bye. I'm going to be very blunt.
7478000	7488000	Those emails from Tim Sweeney look like they were written by whatever press relations department North Korea uses when talking about their weapons arsenal.
7488000	7495000	That is how that letter basically read is that, you know, you will rise to the mighty.
7495000	7498000	OK, maybe it wasn't that bad, but that's how it was like, like reading to me.
7498000	7504000	It was like, my God, he's just making all these demands for what?
7504000	7510000	And what are you going to give? You know, like it just it just seems so shady.
7510000	7523000	It is so it's interesting, though, that he would want somebody to bypass their payment system to offer to basically bypass their whole marketplace, but yet be available on on their devices.
7523000	7528000	But the same time, like I can't put a game on his store and like bypass their payment system.
7528000	7534000	I can't pay him less money because I just feel like I want to do that. I just I don't know.
7534000	7547000	I have a hard time. You know, seeing the logic here where they're the victim, but to still play the victim, though, of course, they have, you know.
7547000	7554000	They they're still doing their campaign, their social campaign to try to get people to, you know, put pressure on Apple and stuff.
7554000	7564000	And I see this this they have a nice little a photo here of a hat that's parroting Apple as well.
7564000	7569000	I don't know. Basically, they're saying it's this whole.
7569000	7576000	Looks like they're doing a competition right now for this free fortnight cup, which is apparently was today.
7576000	7580000	It's just a PR thing, whatever. Yeah.
7580000	7584000	So. I don't know. I think it's dumb.
7584000	7589000	And plus, I need to be able to say say this because I love tooting my own horn when I'm right.
7589000	7593000	I mean, I don't like being right all the time, but I can't help it. No, I get a lot of things wrong, too.
7593000	7598000	But last week I was right because I said, what is the whole motivation for this?
7598000	7602000	Why is Epic doing this? What is the this isn't about? I said this isn't about Fortnite.
7602000	7606000	This is about Epic winning the Epic Game Store on iOS.
7606000	7615000	And sure enough, what was in those court filings? A reference to Epic and wanting to do their own store on iOS.
7615000	7622000	And that thing is locked and loaded and ready to go. And if Epic prevails in this whole thing, that is exactly what they're going to want to launch.
7622000	7625000	And I just, you know, and I just defer to what I said last week.
7625000	7630000	Epic needs to fix their fucking problems on PC first before they jump into iOS.
7630000	7634000	And you know what? You might not be an Apple fan and that's fine.
7634000	7641000	But where this goes, what about Nintendo? What about Sony? What about Microsoft?
7641000	7651000	Because if Epic, like shoehorn, literally shoehorns their way on iOS in this regard, it's going to happen on game consoles as well.
7651000	7652000	You better believe it.
7652000	7658000	Exactly. Yeah, because you can't you can't make the argument that, well, it's these are closed platforms and anybody can be allowed to do it.
7658000	7662000	But I think that these are private companies. I don't understand why you should.
7662000	7664000	Sure, I would love to see competition.
7664000	7671000	They signed an agreement they don't like, and now they're trying to say that it's unfair and all this other stuff.
7671000	7678000	Like, I understand if they have issue with Apple's 30% cut or whatever and they want to negotiate a better deal.
7678000	7681000	But that's the key term there is negotiate.
7681000	7693000	And everything I said last week about the thing, whether you like it or not, with Apple's platform, about how they quality review all the apps, even the free ones that make no money to Apple or the developer.
7693000	7700000	They review those two, whether you like it or not, like that stuff doesn't pay for itself.
7700000	7705000	So they're going to take a cut somewhere. And Epic badly wants to undercut them.
7705000	7709000	I'm telling you, I am I am I am 100 percent right on this.
7709000	7714000	Epic wants to undercut them and they're going to leverage their Unreal Engine to do it.
7714000	7717000	I'm this is I see the end of this coming.
7717000	7726000	So like if you're going to root against Apple because you think Apple has too much control or Apple calls all the shots, guess wake up.
7726000	7730000	Epic is trying to position themselves to do the same thing.
7730000	7738000	If Epic really wants that, though, you know what they should do. Make their own fucking phone.
7738000	7745000	Well, and on top of that, though, like I get that with on the Apple side of the house, but then they did the same thing on the Google Play Store.
7745000	7753000	And if you look there, that's kind of a different scenario because they could, in a sense, put out their own storefront.
7753000	7756000	Sure, you'd have to sideload it, but you can do that.
7756000	7762000	You could put out your own storefront and have your own purchasing stuff and have it completely bypass everything.
7762000	7766000	But you can't advertise it on the Google Play Store.
7766000	7774000	You can't have like it's, you know, be on there just to, you know, download that and load it in and just pay directly to Epic.
7774000	7779000	You can't do that. So you've got to play by their rules if you want to be on their storefront.
7779000	7785000	Just the same as if I were to put something on epic storefront, I have to play by the rules in order to do that.
7785000	7789000	I can't just say, well, you know, I don't know if they charge.
7789000	7794000	See, that's the thing with Epic. I don't know if they charge for like, you know, a cut of any of the DLC and stuff like that.
7794000	7797000	But let's just say that they do, because it would make sense if they did.
7797000	7802000	But say I wanted to sell this stuff directly to my users instead, and I didn't want them to take a cut of that.
7802000	7806000	Well, I'm sure they wouldn't be happy about that. So it's the exact same thing.
7806000	7812000	Sorry, but not sorry. You have to abide by those rules to be on that storefront.
7812000	7815000	I'm sorry that you're upset that you can't be on iOS devices.
7815000	7828000	Now. Yeah. And look, and I said this on last week's show, like, yes, I'm firmly on Apple's side in this particular debacle as I'm wearing my AirPods and streaming this show from my Mac Mini.
7828000	7832000	But guess what? Tim Sweeney tweets from his iPhone. So you know what?
7832000	7837000	But I don't believe Apple is I want to make this clear. I don't believe Apple is right on everything.
7837000	7842000	For example, the streaming and the cloud stuff and them holding back the X Cloud app.
7842000	7852000	That is wrong. And they need to allow those apps because they allow if they allow Netflix, if they allow CBS All Access and those streaming apps to exist, they ought to be able to allow the gaming apps as well.
7852000	7857000	I do believe that will work itself out in time.
7857000	7862000	It's just a little slower because it's somewhat of a newer concept.
7862000	7866000	But that is a separate issue.
7866000	7871000	This epic thing has because I see some people confusing this on Twitter a little bit, too.
7871000	7875000	This epic thing has nothing to do with the cloud streaming stuff.
7875000	7881000	Not a thing. This is about the Apple in app store model.
7881000	7886000	And honestly, I think and somebody will have to refresh my memory because I honestly don't recall.
7886000	7892000	Whatever happened with Sony and the other OS when they removed that from the console?
7892000	7899000	Did the court side because wasn't there a class action or I think we got a check in the mail.
7899000	7903000	So it was but it was settled, not legally decided, right?
7903000	7911000	Because I feel like I feel like the precedence is in that case.
7911000	7914000	Yes. So.
7914000	7917000	Yeah, I think it was settled.
7917000	7919000	I was going to mention, though, kind of going back to the story there.
7919000	7936000	Microsoft had also filed a declaration in support of Epic's case against Apple, because, as I mentioned, with the developer access being removed, the Unreal Engine support and the ability to develop for that has been kind of harmed as well.
7936000	7940000	So, you know, they have games that use the Unreal Engine.
7940000	7947000	And because of that, you know, that that hurts not only them, but like even indie developers who use the Unreal Engine for.
7947000	7955000	I feel like dear leader Sweeney sent Microsoft an email that it was I doubt it was a bullying email, but it was probably one of those.
7955000	7965000	If Apple pulls us from the attention developers, if Apple's looking, they're they're recruiting people to do their dirty work and Microsoft fell for it.
7965000	7968000	That is my that is my opinion on this in this particular case.
7968000	7972000	And Phil Spencer, God bless him. He's done great things for Xbox.
7972000	7978000	He fell for this one because Epic is recruiting people to do their dirty work and sent out an email.
7978000	7986000	I bet you I bet you I bet you sent out an email that says if Apple does this, we're no longer going to be able to support you after such and such day.
7986000	7996000	So we can't guarantee that your money making brand new force app you just put out is going to be able to make money because Apple's mean.
7996000	8006000	Well, I think, though, that they may have also vested interest because they're trying to get, you know, the game streaming as well on the iOS platform.
8006000	8011000	But I don't think they didn't necessarily come out and say that.
8011000	8020000	Yeah, I don't think it will. Obviously, their negotiations for that type of stuff is probably a little bit more nuanced and say what Tim Sweeney did.
8020000	8028000	But. I don't know, I'm just going for the whole thing to play out. I don't play Fortnite on iOS anyway, so.
8028000	8035000	Sorry, Bobby said the Microsoft thing was actually about Epic losing access to the developer tools, not about Fortnite.
8035000	8040000	But those things are still hand in hand because they wouldn't have lost access to developer tools. They hadn't pulled the stunt with Fortnite.
8041000	8046000	I'm surprised. I would love to know what Sony and Microsoft and Nintendo think about.
8046000	8058000	Hold on. Chat is already typing a comment. I just want to say, like, I don't know if Apple will hold firm to that.
8058000	8066000	I think there's a very, and I don't know, but I think there's a very distinct possibility if the pressure from Microsoft and these other companies does anything,
8066000	8073000	it will probably put a stay on this developer tool issue until they work out their other stuff.
8073000	8078000	But Fortnite, I don't expect to come back until there's a settlement.
8078000	8083000	Because it won't be decided by court. There's going to be a settlement. I don't know. Well, I don't know.
8083000	8090000	It depends what kind of hardball Apple wants to play here. I don't know. We'll see. We'll see.
8091000	8102000	And Bobby in chat is talking about how people are this is an epic maybe potentially saw an opportunity here to dogpile on Apple.
8102000	8108000	I'm paraphrasing. Dogpile on Apple because they were already weakened by the xCloud argument on this.
8108000	8113000	And that's why I'm going out of my way to say these are separate issues. And is it okay to say Apple?
8113000	8119000	I don't think this is a good look, but I think this you're doing okay. Two different things.
8119000	8121000	So. All right.
8121000	8127000	Dijarama says Apple does have a monopoly on the App Store. So also not surprised.
8127000	8134000	What about Nintendo? What about Microsoft? What about Sony?
8134000	8145000	Same thing, right? Technically true. It's technically true that they they have, you know, the monopoly there unless they're counting like retail sales because you can buy code sometimes at retail for those things.
8145000	8149000	But I don't think so. But yeah, it's the same thing.
8149000	8157000	And like and I would worry that like what is why? Why is Apple any different when it comes to.
8157000	8160000	What's going to make them not try to do the same thing for consoles?
8160000	8167000	I'm guessing because more of the market shares there, maybe they're making more money from there.
8167000	8171000	I don't know. But like, yeah, I would.
8171000	8183000	It's weird to see them try to burn bridges like that, because, I mean, you know, you have to work with all these other people, like in these other companies, and they see you doing this and it's like, well, they'd be less likely to want to work with you.
8183000	8186000	You know, and that kind of talk was also going to.
8186000	8190000	That's the kind of talk that gets you bought by Apple, too.
8191000	8196000	Yes, true when they just valued as like a two billion or two trillion dollar company this week or something was in the news.
8196000	8201000	VG Realness says, I don't know why Apple can't offer a lower percentage cut, but offers zero advertising in their apps.
8201000	8206000	You know, that was one place that I suggested a settlement could happen last week, sort of.
8206000	8213000	I said, what if they could maybe allow the in-app purchasing off the store or whatever?
8213000	8217000	But now Apple is going to charge them every time they want to do a reveal.
8217000	8224000	Every time you want to do a patch, every time you're going to put a new thing on the store because you're circumventing our store, we're now going to charge you.
8224000	8237000	And I would I would bet even if Epic is victorious in this, that doesn't mean Apple doesn't immediately change their terms to say, all right, then we're going to get our money this way.
8238000	8247000	I so I can't see that being a victorious. I'm pretty sure other companies will be the same. And like, it's not going to happen. Sorry.
8247000	8253000	Yeah, I just I just epic. I think Epic is fighting a losing battle here.
8253000	8259000	And I think part of them kind of knows it. And that's why they're recruiting the Internet to help them out.
8259000	8264000	Because they want to they want to convict in the court of public opinion.
8264000	8276000	The only the only way I could see like something happening where they could possibly get by with multiple storefronts is if they use the precedent set by where Microsoft had to.
8276000	8283000	They could I think it was they couldn't have although they do have Internet Explorer like preloaded in there, but they couldn't.
8283000	8287000	It is something to do with their web browser. Like they couldn't have like other stuff preloaded on there.
8287000	8293000	They had to give you the option to be able to not use it or something. But I don't I don't remember the details.
8293000	8298000	But I know that there has been precedent set with some of those types of cases antitrust stuff.
8298000	8303000	But I don't think this can get that far. I think they're just going to say, nope, sorry.
8303000	8309000	And the reality you agreed to those rules to that. The reality is a lot of us have passionate opinions on this particular topic.
8309000	8314000	I have my opinions. Every single one of you in chat have your opinions. Loki has his opinion.
8314000	8318000	The reality is none of it's going to matter. This is going to be decided by either a settlement.
8319000	8324000	I would say 90 percent likely a settlement because that's how they always go or it'll be decided by a court.
8324000	8328000	And let's be real. What happens in both of those places never makes sense.
8328000	8334000	Well, sometimes sometimes make sense, but it is probably not going to make sense to any of us.
8334000	8339000	And that's that. So. All right. We'll see what develops next.
8339000	8346000	I don't think this story is going away anytime soon. We'll see, especially with the deadline for the kit and all that coming up next.
8346000	8349000	All right. Let's move on. We have a couple or just one more quick story for you.
8349000	8352000	And then we'll get to the listener roundtable in our mailbag for tonight.
8352000	8357000	So I'm getting to this story about Nintendo coming to Brazil.
8357000	8365000	That's right. Officially. Now, of course, you know, we've heard about stories on the show before about how you can get video game consoles in countries where they're not officially supported.
8365000	8373000	But that can be very, very expensive to do. So it could be very exciting news if you live in Brazil to hear that Nintendo is coming back.
8373000	8378000	Now, Nintendo was in Brazil up until about five years ago.
8378000	8385000	So Nintendo is going to be debuting the Switch officially in Brazil because they left the country about five years ago.
8385000	8390000	And Nintendo of America made a tweet saying, greetings to all the Brazilian Nintendo fans out there.
8390000	8393000	We're excited to announce that the Nintendo Switch will be coming soon to Brazil.
8393000	8401000	So that's pretty exciting. As a reminder, Nintendo had originally pulled out in 2015 because of high tariffs on imported products.
8401000	8405000	But now, you know, people are wanting a Switch and so forth.
8405000	8410000	So, yeah, Brazil, by the way, the fourth largest gaming market in the world.
8410000	8416000	Did you know that? Do you know who the top three are? Do you know who the top three are? Because it would surprise you.
8416000	8424000	I don't know. One, two, three. But the other three are the US, China and India.
8425000	8431000	Not Japan. You would have thought. But certainly consider the populations of China and India.
8431000	8435000	And that would certainly. Oh, yes, there is a lot a lot of people in both those places.
8435000	8439000	And that would explain why those are very those are also very, very big markets.
8439000	8444000	So Brazil, the fourth largest market for games. Nintendo Switch finally officially making its way there.
8444000	8449000	So congrats. All right. Moving on. Let's get to.
8449000	8452000	Hey, actually, I'm. Well, I think it's kind of a dumb question.
8452000	8458000	I was going to say if because I'm going to ask act deft because I know him being in Mexico,
8458000	8462000	he sometimes has problems with importing and stuff like that.
8462000	8470000	But I guess it's probably going to be easier still to get products from the US than it would be to get stuff from Brazil because Brazil's further.
8470000	8475000	So I'm just not sure if maybe that would improve the situation by giving other,
8475000	8481000	you know, countries on this this hemisphere of the planet, but probably probably not.
8481000	8486000	All right. Anyway, let's get to the listener roundtable.
8486000	8490000	I'm going to wait. I'm going to come back to an answer if I see one. Meanwhile, we already have some questions coming in from chat.
8490000	8496000	If you have any questions you want to ask us, you can go ahead and ask away in our chat room over twitch dot TV slash vog network.
8496000	8500000	And I'll be getting to we have one email tonight. I will get to here shortly.
8500000	8506000	First off, though, a question from no one special in our chat who asks if you could open up an arcade,
8506000	8514000	what games would you include and would it be a straight up arcade, a barcade or a pizzeria arcade combo?
8514000	8520000	Well, in my opinion, the round one chain has things set up pretty good.
8520000	8523000	You know, they have the Japanese games that are relevant to my interests.
8523000	8528000	And that's the type of thing I'd love to have in my arcade. I would have more pinball than around one has.
8528000	8532000	I could do without the bowling and the some of the stuff they do around one.
8532000	8538000	It's just not really for my type of place. And also round one has a lot of those ticket redemption machines.
8538000	8542000	I'm not big fans of those, but I'm also not an idiot.
8542000	8546000	Here's here's the return question I would have. Is this arcade supposed to make money?
8546000	8549000	Yes or no? Because the arcade supposed to make money.
8549000	8553000	I'm going to have to have those ticket spinners because they make money.
8553000	8558000	If my arcade doesn't need to make money, then I don't need as many of them.
8558000	8565000	So, yeah, let me I'm going to answer for Loki. I'm using my powers of mind reading.
8565000	8571000	Loki is going to simply open a QZAR. Am I right?
8571000	8575000	That's not really. Yeah, I mean, I guess you're right.
8575000	8578000	That's that's neither of the options that was provided.
8578000	8583000	I mean, I'm going to go pizza place, obviously pizza arcade, if we're going to have to do something like that.
8583000	8587000	And creepy, creepy, creepy animatronics.
8587000	8595000	Yes, that's a must that sing every hour this time because, you know, why not?
8595000	8602000	Actually, that'd be really cool. Like like some pretty awesome animatronics, especially nowadays, you know, animatronic technology is really progressed.
8602000	8609000	I want to license Five Nights at Freddy's and have a legit scary food chain.
8609000	8615000	You know, there'd be a market for that and no fucking kids would go. Well, some might, but that would be amazing.
8615000	8628000	Is that like let's go to the murder pizzeria or what if he did like, you know, you did like a pizza place with an arcade themed after Freddy Fazbear.
8628000	8634000	With an escape room with horror elements.
8634000	8641000	That sounds although pizza and alcohol, greasy fingers and alcohol are a dangerous combo for escape rooms, that's for sure.
8641000	8643000	By the way, we have an answer from Act Deaf.
8643000	8653000	Well, sort of I'll get back to you later because Act Deaf says, I really need to send you an email pretty much talking about the current video game situation in Mexico.
8653000	8656000	In summary, we're getting taxed to hell and back.
8656000	8661000	So it sounds like what was happening in Brazil for the last few years.
8661000	8664000	In short, sounds like it. But I always welcome the emails.
8664000	8678000	I love the perspectives from other countries around the world because I think so many people listening to this show, even if it like US, Canada, England or, you know, whatever country, Japan, wherever you're in, you tend to forget about the world sometimes outside of that bubble.
8678000	8684000	And so I find these types of stories fascinating what some gamers go through just to play their fucking game.
8684000	8686000	You know, it's it's pretty, pretty crazy.
8686000	8692000	SJ100Matt kind of piggybacks on that and says, South America is very hard to get games there.
8692000	8699000	I heard from someone in Argentina that they had to spend fifteen hundred dollars to just get a console out there because of tariffs and other taxes.
8699000	8706000	Jesus, just let me buy one for you and sneak it in my suitcase. God damn, that's crazy.
8706000	8717000	All right. Anyhow, let's get to the email, which I will do from my phone because I neglected to bring it up on the screen.
8717000	8723000	So let's get to it. This email tonight comes to us from YYR.
8723000	8727000	We always love hearing from YYR. It's a long email tonight, but that's OK.
8727000	8732000	Hello, LR. Please forgive the length of this email. Forgiven.
8732000	8736000	I've been catching up on episodes and of course, I found a few things to chime in on.
8736000	8743000	By the way, the title of this email is Rapid Fire Responses. Rob, thank you for plugging Sharpshooter Plus once again.
8743000	8748000	And Loki, thanks for playing Pixel Poops on your Vita. You're welcome. You just got another plug. How about that?
8748000	8750000	I didn't play it on my Vita, though.
8750000	8752000	Oh, no.
8752000	8758000	That's right. I have been playing it this week, though. I have been playing it on PC.
8758000	8763000	OK. As long as you're playing the game, I don't think YYR cares where you're playing it.
8763000	8770000	All right. A few weeks back, Rob said that he felt we've basically reached the pinnacle of video game graphics.
8770000	8777000	I, too, once felt this way. It was back when the original Quake came out and I thought, that's it. We have real 3D now.
8777000	8782000	All we have to do is increase the resolution. Clearly, there was more to do back then, around 20 years ago.
8782000	8787000	If you want my honest opinion, there's still more to do. And 20 years from now, things will look amazing compared to now.
8787000	8796000	Yeah. I mean, I kind of think we've plateaued a little bit right now, but that's not to say there won't be other advancements in the future.
8796000	8801000	And what have we always said about gaming on this show? One step closer to the holodeck.
8801000	8809000	And I think that's, I think maybe for two-dimensional images, we've gotten about as far as it feels like we're going to go right now.
8809000	8814000	But we're going to have things that continue to move forward, like VR and AR.
8814000	8826000	And I really think what pushes graphics forward is going to come from those two places a little more than it is your traditional living room devices.
8826000	8834000	And again, those devices are pushing things forward, too. It's just, it feels like the jump maybe isn't as big as it was in those eras you were talking about.
8834000	8845000	But yeah, I mean, I remember the first time I played Mario Brothers 2 on my NES. I was like, this is like a cartoon. I'm playing a cartoon. This is crazy.
8845000	8855000	Right? Because the graphics in Mario 2 were on fire. So, especially that ending where you had like cartoon Mario in the bed. I mean, spoiler alert for a 30-year-old game.
8855000	8859000	But it looked like a fucking cartoon. It was a trip.
8859000	8867000	All right. Anyway. Rob expressed disappointment that new Bomani games on PC never seem to come to North America.
8867000	8874000	If you want my opinion, here's the likely reason it's not happening in two words. Music licensing.
8874000	8881000	My counter opinion to that opinion would be, why do you need Konami originals?
8882000	8891000	But I get your point. Like, I'm not dismissing your point. But let's not forget, they did release Conomics over here for a reason.
8891000	8894000	Because you don't have to worry about licensing fees in that department.
8894000	8903000	In last week's discussion, disappointment was expressed because it appears that neither PS5 nor XSX will have great launch lineups.
8903000	8909000	But is that really anything new? I would argue that no PlayStation has ever had a great launch lineup.
8909000	8915000	And that Xbox hasn't had one since the 360. So this is probably not going to affect their long-term numbers much.
8915000	8919000	I would agree with you on that. Like, what did the PlayStation 2 have going for it?
8919000	8925000	Fantavision? Which, there's going to be a million people that pipe up and say, I fucking love Fantavision.
8925000	8927000	Okay, that's fine. But let's be real, it wasn't-
8927000	8928000	I love Fantavision.
8928000	8931000	I know! Okay, we get it. You like Fantavision.
8931000	8933000	We had it on the stream the other day. It was in the background.
8933000	8937000	But it wasn't exactly that launch title.
8937000	8941000	No, it wasn't. I rented that game too, so that wasn't necessarily- yeah.
8941000	8949000	Alright. Anyway. Loki lamented the fact that Xbox One controllers still use AA batteries.
8949000	8954000	Well, I'm glad they do. Because at least in my eyes, they are far superior to built-in rechargeable batteries.
8954000	8960000	I purchased rechargeable AA batteries and a charger, and I always have a pair of charged batteries ready to go.
8960000	8964000	When they die, I spend 30 seconds swapping batteries and I'm playing again.
8964000	8969000	I never have to wait, I never have to find a charging cable, and I never ever have to plug the controller in.
8969000	8973000	And if the batteries stop holding a charge in the future, replacing them is simple.
8973000	8977000	I fail to see how a built-in battery is better.
8977000	8983000	I mean, like, look at the Switch. I hate to say that, but look at the Switch and the Joy-Cons.
8983000	8989000	I mean, they're always charged. I never have to worry about it because when I dock the thing, it's charging them.
8989000	8994000	And it's never a problem. And let's say that one of those batteries craps out.
8994000	8998000	I've taken apart the Switch and Joy-Cons. It's cake to replace that battery.
8998000	9003000	It's like five minutes at most, and the part I think is probably about ten bucks.
9003000	9009000	So, I mean, I don't know. I would rather have the built-in rechargeable battery.
9009000	9013000	I will say AA batteries last forever though, more so than the rechargeable.
9013000	9018000	Yeah, I mean, I guess if you make it power, you know, if you make it to the point-
9018000	9022000	Because, I mean, granted, I'm thinking back to the Xbox 360 and those batteries.
9022000	9027000	Those things sucked battery power. Actually, even before that, the Wii remotes.
9027000	9030000	Those things ate batteries for breakfast.
9030000	9038000	Whereas, now I'm sure there's a lot more power-saving stuff that they can do to those controllers that make them last a little longer.
9038000	9042000	So, I don't know. I can't really judge because I don't own an Xbox One controller.
9042000	9044000	So, I can't say how long those batteries last.
9044000	9046000	They last a while. I have one.
9046000	9057000	Yeah, I would prefer, like, even the option that they had with, like, the Xbox 360 where I could plug in a rechargeable battery pack that's sold by Microsoft that I can just charge up that way if I wanted to.
9057000	9060000	I like having the flexibility there, but I don't know if they have that.
9060000	9064000	Just say you're thinking of the environment. Just say that.
9064000	9066000	Sure. Thinking of the environment.
9066000	9070000	All right. Moving on to the last point here.
9070000	9076000	Finally, I'm going to say that I completely agree with your assessment of the Epic versus Apple thing that's happening right now.
9076000	9085000	I try to be impartial whenever possible, and as a developer, I honestly feel that some of Apple's policies are a royal pain in the ass, but in my opinion, there's just no defending Epic here.
9085000	9090000	Epic cries and cries about the 30% cut, but here's the thing.
9090000	9100000	In the documents Apple has filed, they reveal they're getting about 100,000 app and update submissions per week, every single week.
9100000	9102000	Review of these submissions is not automated.
9102000	9106000	Each one of these is reviewed by a living, breathing human person.
9106000	9116000	Not to mention, Apple also provides developer support, tools, hosting, distribution, maintenance, and probably more than we don't even consider, all for zero out-of-pocket costs to developers.
9117000	9130000	I'm sorry to interrupt. I would say one thing I really wish that they would fix if we're opening up everything is the fact that you have to have a Mac to develop on any of the Apple platforms is kind of lame. That's all.
9130000	9137000	Okay. And I just got a notice that my little earbuds are about to die. So anyway, this is my first show I'm doing.
9137000	9140000	Just switch out the AA batteries in them.
9140000	9144000	Yeah, I know, right? I thought I could get through all three hours with them, but maybe not.
9144000	9146000	So I might have to switch to something more old school here.
9146000	9150000	Luckily, I have the old school stuff standing by just in case this should happen.
9150000	9152000	Anyway, let me finish the email here, though.
9152000	9158000	If the 30%... Fuck, I lost my place. Damn it.
9158000	9161000	Oh, 100,000 app and update submissions per week, every single week.
9161000	9164000	Review of these submissions is not automated.
9164000	9167000	Each one of these is reviewed by a living, breathing human person.
9167000	9172000	Not to mention, Apple also provides developer support, tools, hosting, distribution, maintenance,
9172000	9177000	and probably more that we don't even consider, all for zero out-of-pocket costs to developers.
9177000	9182000	All of the salaries that go to staff supporting this stuff come right out of that 30% cut.
9182000	9189000	Apple also claims that up to 80% of the apps on the store are 100% free with no in-app purchases.
9189000	9194000	Apple doesn't make a dime on any of these. They still support them, though, and for free.
9194000	9197000	One moment, please, while I switch this out. Loki, buy me time.
9197000	9202000	Alright, well, since we're buying time, let's talk a little bit about Fall Guys.
9202000	9208000	So, Fall Guys... So, I completely lost track. Gamescom's this week, so we have that to look forward to.
9208000	9212000	So, they're going to have their opening night stream on August 27th, and apparently, they're going to show off
9212000	9217000	Fall Guys Season 2 content at 11 a.m. Pacific, so tune in to check that out.
9217000	9222000	I'm just going to tune in and check out all the trailers because I love that kind of stuff.
9222000	9225000	And apparently, if you want Fall Guys on mobile, well, you're in luck.
9225000	9232000	If you're in China, because they're going to be releasing the game over there at some point,
9232000	9238000	it's being developed now by Bilibili. They've secured the rights to publish a mobile version of the game,
9238000	9243000	which is funny because this is right after Fall Guys' official Twitter has been talking about
9243000	9249000	how there's scams about mobile versions of Fall Guys, talking about how they're literally just pretending
9249000	9252000	to play a game, and you can see the mouse pointer on the screen and stuff like that.
9252000	9255000	It's a little bit confusing there, but...
9255000	9258000	Why don't you let Stella play Fall Guys?
9258000	9263000	She's across the room, hiding behind a bag, yelling at me for some reason.
9263000	9267000	She wants you to move the bag. Anyway, I'm back, and I'm ready to finish YYR's email.
9267000	9272000	Sorry, YYR, but you did admittedly have a long email, and the batteries to my headset literally died
9272000	9274000	while I was reading it. Sorry.
9274000	9276000	Anyway, finishing up the thought.
9276000	9281000	If the 30% cut was to go away, the business model would likely need to completely change.
9281000	9286000	Submitting or resubmitting an app, upgrading developer tools, and bandwidth used by customers
9286000	9290000	might all start coming with a cost to developers. This sounds familiar.
9290000	9296000	This would likely wipe out the smallest developers and cause the largest ones to stop releasing free apps.
9296000	9299000	Things would change considerably, and I don't think it would be for the better.
9299000	9306000	Anyway, if you got this far, thanks for reading, and please look forward to an announcement regarding Pixel Poops soon.
9306000	9308000	Yeah, why not?
9308000	9312000	And that is signed. Have a great week, Aaron, or YYR.
9312000	9315000	Well, thank you, YYR, for the email. Appreciate it as always.
9315000	9317000	Appreciate your perspective, even when you do disagree.
9317000	9320000	After all, it is the show where every gamer has a voice.
9320000	9323000	And yeah, that Epic Apple thing is sure bringing out a lot of big opinions.
9323000	9327000	But, like I said earlier, none of us are going to answer this.
9328000	9330000	So, but I think you do bring up a good point.
9330000	9333000	Like, you know, Apple does review a lot of the free apps, too.
9333000	9337000	And what's going to happen to them if suddenly there's going to be a cost to review stuff?
9337000	9340000	That's why I think there's maybe going to have to be a little give and take.
9340000	9342000	But we'll see. We'll see.
9342000	9346000	You know, there was that weird story about how Apple had pulled WordPress or something
9346000	9350000	because they thought WordPress was selling outside the app, but I guess they cleared it up.
9350000	9354000	But it wasn't a good story to come. It just gave Epic ammunition is all it did.
9354000	9359000	All right. Anyhow, that's it for the mailbag.
9359000	9363000	If you want to send us an email for a future week, participate at orangelaungeradio.com
9363000	9365000	is the place to send us an email.
9365000	9369000	Logan, did you have any other last minute stories besides the fall guy stuff you snuck in there?
9369000	9371000	No, I didn't really have anything.
9371000	9374000	Fair enough. Well, we're almost to 9 o'clock anyway, so I think it's a good time to wrap up.
9374000	9379000	So I want to thank you guys for either downloading our show, listening live,
9379000	9381000	however you participated with Orange Lounge Radio tonight.
9381000	9383000	Thank you so much for being a part of it.
9383000	9385000	We will be back next week to do it all again.
9385000	9388000	We will not be here in two weeks.
9388000	9391000	We will have the night off for Labor Day weekend, as we always have,
9391000	9395000	because I'm usually at Dragon Con, and that's going to be the case again this year.
9395000	9400000	I'm just going to be there virtually, and I'm actually doing a panel during the time that Orange Lounge Radio is.
9400000	9403000	I'll give you the rundown on all the panels I'm going to be on next week.
9403000	9406000	Bobby talked about some of it on his show.
9406000	9408000	I just don't have the times in front of me. Oops.
9408000	9415000	But I know I'm going to be on Bobby's panel that is about the conversion from audio podcasting to video podcasting,
9415000	9417000	called Video Didn't Kill the Radio Star.
9417000	9419000	I'm going to be on that panel.
9419000	9422000	I'm also going to be on a panel about networking and content networks
9422000	9427000	and what are the advantages and disadvantages of joining a network for your content creation.
9427000	9430000	This is a pretty regular panel. I think Bobby has done this panel before.
9430000	9432000	They do this a lot at Dragon Con.
9432000	9436000	It's an important part of the digital media track, so I'm going to represent us this year.
9436000	9438000	So that's going to be very exciting.
9438000	9442000	And then another panel I'm doing, this one even surprises me that I'm doing it,
9442000	9452000	but it's actually going to be about how educators have had to adapt to technology with what's going on,
9452000	9454000	basically with COVID and everything.
9454000	9461000	And so a lot of the tricks and techniques that we've learned from our digital media creation is coming into education.
9461000	9467000	Now I think when they originally pitched this panel, it was high school and grade school teachers that were doing this
9467000	9471000	because obviously they've gone through quite a change this year.
9471000	9475000	But they posted in the Digital Media Dragon Con Discord and were like,
9475000	9479000	hey, are there any other educators out there that might want to be on this panel?
9479000	9484000	And you guys might not know this, I'm an educator but not in a grade school.
9484000	9489000	I'm a corporate educator, so I work with corporate training and teaching adults.
9489000	9491000	And we've gone through a lot of changes as well.
9491000	9495000	We teach in classrooms and things like that that we're not able to do right now.
9495000	9500000	So I actually sent a little thing off and I was like, I don't know if this is what you're looking for.
9500000	9504000	And they actually really, they were like, oh, that's a good perspective.
9504000	9506000	So they actually really welcomed me with open arms.
9506000	9508000	So I'm really excited to be a part of that.
9508000	9515000	So it's going to be a very rare opportunity to hear me talk about my day job and my hobby.
9515000	9519000	And I don't talk about my day job a lot because I like to keep that stuff separated.
9519000	9523000	So this one's going to be a little bit nerve-wracking in some ways.
9523000	9527000	But I think I can represent, I can walk the line and represent both sides fairly.
9527000	9529000	I think it's going to be a very good discussion.
9529000	9532000	So that is, and that, I talk a little more about that panel
9532000	9536000	because that is the one that's airing where OLR would be.
9536000	9540000	It's actually like, it's 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern on Sunday.
9540000	9542000	So that'll be very interesting.
9542000	9545000	So, all right.
9545000	9549000	Anyway, so I'll go over all that in more detail again next week.
9549000	9552000	But that's Virtual Dragon Con happening in two weeks and there won't be an OLR.
9552000	9554000	And there won't be a Bobby Black Wolf that night either.
9554000	9557000	So VOG is just going to be dark that night.
9557000	9560000	And some of you guys are probably going to be doing stuff for the long Labor Day weekend anyway.
9560000	9564000	However, please remember COVID isn't gone.
9564000	9566000	Just because you're over it doesn't mean it's gone.
9566000	9570000	So you keep masks, keep social distancing, keep washing your hands, etc., etc.
9570000	9573000	Listen to scientists, listen to doctors.
9573000	9576000	So anyway, thank you so much for tuning into our show.
9576000	9578000	We will be back next week to do it all over again
9578000	9580000	and talk about the gaming news that comes up this week.
9580000	9585000	I will, with the two-week thing, sorry, I'm thinking aloud here.
9585000	9588000	But, and I haven't even talked to Loki and Dark Sakura about this.
9588000	9593000	Even though there's not going to be a live OLR Sunday night,
9593000	9602000	if Microsoft, Sony, or Nintendo makes a massive announcement that week,
9602000	9604000	which very well could be possible,
9604000	9609000	we will look at doing a special OLR at some point midweek
9609000	9614000	to wrap up whatever that is, just depending on my co-host's availability.
9614000	9615000	But right, Loki-
9615000	9616000	It's special, after school special.
9616000	9618000	It's going to have to, I mean, that makes sense, right, Loki?
9618000	9621000	Like, I wouldn't want to miss that week and then that ends up being the week
9621000	9623000	that Sony unveiled their price and date, you know?
9623000	9630000	So we're not planning a live show, but we might do a mini or something.
9630000	9631000	So just kind of throwing that out there.
9631000	9633000	A direct.
9633000	9636000	I guess, yeah, a direct to answer the direct.
9636000	9639000	All right, anyway, thank you so much for listening to our show,
9639000	9641000	however you found it, or listening live.
9641000	9644000	If you enjoyed the show, help us spread the word,
9644000	9645000	tell a friend or two about the show,
9645000	9647000	because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
9647000	9649000	but in order to put those voices out there,
9649000	9652000	we've got to have them here in our chat, or in our email bag,
9652000	9654000	on our Twitter, at OLR.
9654000	9655000	Tell a friend about the show.
9655000	9658000	Auto-hosting on Twitch goes a super long way.
9658000	9660000	That's probably the single most powerful thing you can do.
9660000	9664000	Even if you don't stream yourself, add VOG Network to your auto-host list.
9664000	9665000	It goes a long way.
9665000	9672000	And yeah, oh, Bobby's pointing out PAX Online is after Dragon Con this year,
9672000	9673000	so that they're not overlapping.
9673000	9677000	That's kind of neat, because usually PAX and Dragon Con overlap, yeah.
9677000	9679000	All right, I think that's it.
9679000	9680000	We're on our way out.
9680000	9681000	Final thought time.
9681000	9684000	So, Loki, do you have any final thoughts for us tonight?
9684000	9691000	I'm just going to keep on working on things, so that's it.
9691000	9692000	Good luck with things.
9692000	9696000	My final thought is I'm going to keep grinding that Yo-kai Watch event
9696000	9700000	and get my glowy mount, darn it, because that's what it's all about,
9700000	9702000	the eternal pursuit of a glowy mount.
9702000	9705000	Thank you so much for listening to Orange Launch Radio tonight
9705000	9707000	and making us a part of your week.
9707000	9708000	Happy gaming.
9708000	9709000	Be nice to each other.
9709000	9711000	Be safe.
9711000	9712000	Be well.
9712000	9713000	Have a great week.
9713000	9714000	Bye.
9735000	9745000	See you next week.
9765000	9775000	Bye.
