7000	14000	Here's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	22000	Tonight we have gaming news of a possibly 35 year old bug, re-examining a 15 year old bug, and PC builders doing their civic duty for today's reality and remake new content
22000	28000	Stay tuned for the recent articles about old content and news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice
28000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
37000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 815 for this April the 12th of 2020
45000	49000	Happy Easter out there to those of you that celebrate it
49000	55000	To other folks out there, including our very own DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, a very happy bunny day
56000	60000	No, it's still Passover so Chag Pesach Hasanah to everybody
60000	64000	Oh yes, there is that still going on as well, I thought that was midweek
64000	67000	Which ends before my birthday
67000	69000	Well happy that to you as well
69000	76000	I get cake for my birthday and it's gonna be a carrot cake with no raisins and I'll be on the show too
76000	78000	Oh good, well I mean
78000	79000	This is next Sunday
79000	86000	Good and not good, I mean I know you'd probably rather be out at the Cherry Blossom Festival or some of the things you usually do on your birthday weekend
86000	89000	But it's a weird year, we're doing different things
89000	96000	Yeah, I mean I haven't gotten to see any cherry blossoms at all this year which is usually like what I live for, you know
96000	101000	But hey, to my Jew crew listening, Chag Sameach everybody
102000	108000	And something I've been telling all my friends that have a birthday around this time is that you know
108000	112000	At least you completely have justification to get a make up birthday when this is all over
112000	118000	So we're gonna have a lot of birthdays come July, August, June depending on when we're allowed to gather again, who knows
118000	120000	Girl, you know what it's gonna be, right?
121000	123000	We're going to Disneyland
124000	126000	We're all going the fuck to Disneyland
126000	129000	I would be so down for that to be quite honest, so yeah
129000	133000	I don't care how many humans are there, I'll deal, I'll just you know
133000	138000	I don't know though, I mean this is probably gonna be a while, it's probably not gonna be until next year
138000	150000	I mean being logical about it, they're saying you know 18 months at minimum before you know a vaccine is out and kicked in and spread amongst enough people to be effective
150000	152000	Right, well we'll see
152000	153000	We'll play it safe and play it smart
153000	156000	You know we'll listen to the scientists, you know I think yeah
156000	161000	Running and going to Disneyland will probably not be the first thing because Disneyland's gonna be one of the last things to kind of come back
161000	166000	Just like you know I've got my eye on Dragon Con and I'm hopeful that Dragon Con will still happen
166000	171000	I'm hopeful that testing and all that stuff will be at a good enough place, they can do contact tracing and all that stuff
171000	175000	But if the scientists say don't do it, then it is what it is
175000	181000	You know we're gonna listen to science and make our educated decisions that way
181000	186000	I haven't heard anything on DerpyCon either so I mean that's not until the end of October
186000	195000	But certainly next year since I'm not doing, I'm not gonna do Dragon Con anymore because I'll be perfectly honest
195000	202000	They've kind of done one of the groups that I'm in a little bit dirty and on top of that I don't want to support
202000	210000	I mean it's enough that I watch the show and I'll leave it that way, I'm not gonna support someone who does fracking and has been such a shit to other people
210000	215000	So I am probably gonna do Dragon Con next year
215000	221000	Don't say it if you don't mean it, don't say it if you don't mean it
221000	228000	I need to talk to you about you know what the situation for us going and you know panels and crap but just we'll talk
228000	234000	Between Bobby and I we'll make it work, we'll make it work but yeah don't say it if you don't mean it because you're gonna get my hopes up
235000	240000	I'll put it this way, I do absolutely mean it and I will do whatever is in my power to make it happen
240000	247000	Besides that, I have been contemplating some epic cosplays for next year
247000	249000	There you go, there you go, alright
249000	253000	Including a character I'm probably way too short to portray but hey I really like Zaki
253000	259000	Well somebody else I'd like to get that kind of commitment from, say hello to Techmaster Loki
259000	260000	Yeah, Loki
261000	264000	And Loki might be on mute, hello?
264000	266000	I'm sorry my key binds aren't working
266000	267000	Oh that's okay
267000	269000	It wasn't working for a second because I was typing in chat
269000	272000	Alright well, oh okay, well you're multitasking, that's fine
272000	275000	And you're reminding us that we do have a live chat room because we do tape live
275000	280000	Every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network
280000	284000	Twitch.tv slash VOG Network, V-O-G Network
284000	291000	You can also visit us on the web at VOGNetwork.com because we have a lot of friendly podcasts that we're in this network with
291000	298000	A lot of awesome shows that, you know, not only things we host here at VOG Network on Twitch, things like Girls Gone Wow and Anime Jam Session
298000	303000	But the interesting, not that this quarantine situation is a good thing at all
303000	307000	But if you want to look for the diamonds in the rough, shall we say
307000	311000	Some of our podcasts that have gone on hiatus, you know, just because life gets in the way sometimes
311000	313000	Have found the time to record again
313000	316000	So The Geek Card just put out a new episode this last week
316000	319000	And I'm told another one is coming
319000	323000	I don't know if I'm allowed to say what yet, but they're in chat probably so maybe they'll say something
323000	328000	But yeah, so that's, you know, not the way I want shows to come back
328000	334000	But you know, hey, if it's like the one piece of good news in this situation then I will stink and take it
334000	338000	Anyway, so Loki, one of these years we gotta get you to Dragon Con as well
338000	341000	I mean, it probably won't be until the kids are 18, but we'll hope for it
341000	345000	Yeah, well I would have said, yeah, definitely
345000	351000	How has your week been personally? I know usually you do family stuff today
351000	356000	So I know things have kind of changed this year, but were you able to take the kids out to a park to do
356000	358000	Have a good dinner or anything like that?
358000	363000	No, we just, well we had kids this morning
363000	367000	They looked for them in our house, so we did that
367000	373000	And then we went out to the park just to ride, they rode their bikes and stuff
373000	379000	But like, I mean I cook all week, so like, you know, I made my
379000	384000	My honey butter chicken that stuff is like cracked, so
384000	387000	That's right, you talked about that last week, that's awesome
387000	391000	I made that yesterday, yes, I bought four pounds worth of wings and I made all of them in the house
391000	392000	So good
392000	394000	I love it
394000	397000	Alright, yeah, it's interesting how this
397000	400000	You're going to leave some on my doorstep, right?
400000	402000	There's not going to be any left
402000	406000	It's interesting how this situation has led people to doing more cooking
406000	412000	Alan cooked this morning, he made some lemon poppy seed muffins, they were really good
412000	416000	So he doesn't always do stuff like that, so it's cool
416000	423000	I'm making bread with passovers over, but I decided I think tomorrow night, I'm going to try my hand at matzah
423000	430000	Mmm, yum yum, matzah is penance
430000	435000	So yeah, lots of food to eat while we're playing lots of games
435000	438000	And I know there's been lots of game playing amongst the crew this week
438000	441000	We'll get into that in a bit, but we like to start usually with a kickoff topic
441000	445000	So this week's kickoff topic has to do with Nintendo Switch
445000	449000	Which has, you know, is already probably the most popular console out there
449000	451000	I think that would be a fair statement to make right now
451000	457000	Especially because we know PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are kind of on the, you know, they're on their way out the door
457000	465000	As we know, PlayStation 5 and Xbox, I keep wanting to call it the XX, but Xbox Series X are on their way in the door
465000	466000	Just go with your instincts
466000	468000	That's right, go with what you know
468000	472000	So the Switch is probably really the king of the hill right now
472000	483000	Especially when you consider things like Animal Crossing is just like, it's become like this pop culture icon amongst this situation
483000	486000	It has proven to be like the ultimate form of escapism
486000	489000	So, so many people want to get their hands on a Switch
489000	493000	And it's actually come to the point where the Switch supply is really low
493000	499000	And like let's be real, Nintendo isn't the greatest when it comes to hardware demand and all that stuff anyway
499000	502000	And this situation, you know, I'm not trying to make light of the situation
502000	506000	But this situation just isn't helping what's already usually a rough ride for Nintendo
506000	512000	What I mean by that, Nintendo announced this week that they suspended shipments of, excuse me
512000	515000	Can't do anything about that, sneeze is live on air
515000	520000	Nintendo suspended shipments of the Nintendo Switch system in Japan
520000	527000	This is only a temporary thing because if you're not aware, the COVID-19 situation is increasing in Japan
527000	533000	We're probably a couple weeks behind where we've been at in regards to, you know, how it's spreading through the population and so forth
533000	536000	So this is just a temporary move, Nintendo says
536000	540000	But it does mean that devices are not shipping outside of reservations
540000	543000	They don't know when shipments will resume
543000	549000	They are saying that this move does not affect consumers in Europe and North America
549000	553000	But I feel like that just can't be true
553000	558000	And I don't know if that maybe goes all the way back to when China has been going through some of these things
558000	562000	And the factory and the productions there were kind of seeing the trickle down effects
562000	565000	But I know people that are trying to get their hands on a Nintendo Switch
565000	567000	And it really isn't the easiest thing to do right now
567000	572000	To give you an idea of the situation in Japan
572000	577000	The Switch stock is so low that retailers are starting to do lotteries
577000	587000	So a Japanese store named Yamada Denke put up a lottery to potentially buy 130 Switch consoles
587000	590000	And 900 copies of Ring Fit Adventure
590000	592000	Which is another really hard thing to find right now
592000	595000	Probably because it involves hardware
595000	598000	It has that little ring that goes with it, that resistance band
598000	601000	And so it probably limits the number of those that Nintendo can put out
601000	606000	200,000 people entered the lottery
606000	609000	199,000 of them flippers
609000	610000	No, I'm just kidding
610000	612000	But I'm also probably not sadly
612000	614000	But 200,000 people entered the lottery
614000	617000	That is for one retailer
617000	620000	So yeah, Nintendo is trying to ship more units
620000	627000	But that gives you an idea how crazy the supply and the demand is right there right now in Japan
627000	633000	So what is it about the Nintendo Switch that is driving people crazy for it
633000	634000	I can tell you
634000	637000	Let me come to you, Dark Sakura, for your opinion
637000	642000	But I just want to say, especially now in this quarantine COVID situation
642000	647000	These sorts of things we expect to hear around the holidays, around the launch
647000	650000	But we're not talking the launch period
650000	652000	This is like two years into the system's life now
652000	653000	Dark Sakura, what's your thoughts?
653000	655000	Animal Crossing
655000	658000	What is it about Animal Crossing?
659000	668000	Well, and I'm looking at it sort of as my two years of psychology before I changed my major type stuff
668000	674000	The issue is that right now a lot of stuff is out of control, right?
674000	679000	We don't have a lot of active control over what we can do in our lives
679000	682000	We can't go out, we can't do things
682000	684000	We can't see the people that we want to see
685000	691000	But Animal Crossing has been this way to remotely visit people
691000	695000	I mean, for me, I've been hanging out with my friend Gwen practically every day
695000	700000	We were college roommates and haven't seen each other since a couple of years since I moved out here
700000	703000	But we chat every day
703000	706000	She used to be in our WoW guild for a while
706000	710000	You remember? She's actually on Final Fantasy XIV right now
710000	711000	Yeah, I know she is, yeah
711000	715000	So anyway, I've been playing with Tiara
715000	718000	They've been really good company
718000	721000	I can do stuff in my town
721000	725000	It's something that I have a more active control over
725000	730000	Something that I am doing, something that's giving me that immediate reward
730000	736000	And on top of that, now some people have been absolutely cutthroat with the game
736000	742000	But it's been a lot of people cooperating with each other
742000	747000	It's taking that stuff that we're trying to encourage people to do in real life
747000	754000	But we have this controllable environment that kind of does let us be in the presence of other people to interact
754000	758000	Yeah, that's a very interesting take
758000	763000	And I like that, the fact that even though in this situation you can't control things
763000	767000	In Animal Crossing, relatively, you have control over things
767000	769000	I mean, maybe not everything
769000	772000	The other day, Rocket threatened to move out of my town
772000	774000	And I basically said she's not allowed to do that
774000	776000	And if she leaves, I'm going to burn down the town
776000	778000	But she didn't, so I'm very happy about that
778000	781000	Because Rocket and Ketchup are my two favorite villagers, just for the record
781000	784000	I especially love Ketchup, I will die for Ketchup
784000	787000	Octavian is pissing me off because I invited him for a second time
787000	790000	Because he's my favorite grumpy old man octopus
790000	793000	So now I have to invite him a third time to try to convince him
793000	795000	I gave up on Dina
795000	800000	Dina, I think, has moved on to other levels of her lesbianism
803000	807000	I'll tell you what, Brad, Pod Culture and Chats says, how do we send Ed to Jamie?
807000	809000	You shut your whore mouth, okay?
809000	817000	As the island turns, like bells through the hourglass, these are the days of our horizons
817000	820000	But you know what I did find amongst my amiibo cards?
820000	822000	I found Julian
822000	824000	Yeah, no, you had a crap ton of those amiibo cards
824000	826000	And I have the actual figurines
826000	831000	Do you know what I actually have that now apparently is really valuable?
831000	840000	I have a sealed copy of Wii U Animal Crossing with the Isabelle amiibo and the other guy in it, still, sealed
840000	844000	Oh, what you mean the amiibo festival?
844000	846000	The little dog, yeah, amiibo festival, that's it
846000	849000	Those are going for like hundreds of dollars on eBay
849000	853000	I have the game, although I've played it because I actually think it's legit fun
853000	858000	Yeah, no, I never opened it and I was thinking about opening it the other day
858000	863000	Because this is the hilarious part, Alan got it for like 10 bucks on a Target clearance
863000	868000	Because that was one of the last games in the heyday of the Wii U
868000	870000	So that was kind of on its way out the door
870000	872000	And now everybody wants their hands on those amiibo
872000	875000	And Wii U games in general are becoming collector's items
875000	879000	I don't know, I don't know if I want to keep it, sell it, what do I want to do? It's tough
879000	883000	Well, I'll tell you what, nothing has financial value until you try to sell it
883000	884000	I guess that's true
884000	887000	Anyway, I want to get some of the comments from our chat room over at Twitch
887000	889000	And then good fucking luck
889000	894000	Over at twitch.tv slash vog network because a lot of folks have some comments on this
894000	898000	So Mel Chan in our chat says
898000	902000	I have mine but I've been trying to find one for my client to keep her busy
902000	903000	I'm assuming this is a switch
903000	909000	Between tons of families suddenly stuck at home and the biggest game for it in a long time happening simultaneously
909000	911000	It just added to it
911000	912000	Let's see, Fifth Dream Today says
912000	917000	Someone I know from the Goth community I'm in and barely knew since Animal Crossing New Horizons came out
917000	921000	We've been talking and trading and having conversations about other things
921000	924000	Well, you know, sometimes video games really do bring us together
924000	926000	And for me it's always been about MMOs
926000	930000	Like some of my closest friendships were formed because of MMOs
930000	932000	And being able to play MMOs online with people
932000	937000	I mean, hell, even like Loki and I before we lived together we were playing Final Fantasy XI a lot online
937000	940000	So, you know, a lot of times video games can definitely bring us together
940000	945000	And although I wouldn't call Animal Crossing New Horizons an MMO per se
945000	952000	There definitely is an important multiplayer component about it, for sure
952000	956000	YYR says it was definitely the Animal Crossing New Horizons release above all
956000	962000	Also, despite Nintendo's selection of multiplayer games, you need multiple systems to really take advantage
962000	966000	So a lot of thoughts there on the Nintendo Switch shortage
966000	970000	And then when it comes to Ring Fit Adventure, SHG100Matt says
970000	972000	I've been playing a ton of Ring Fit Adventure
972000	975000	It's the best thing to keep me active without going outside
975000	977000	Which I do at midnight when no one is around
977000	979000	But Ring Fit Adventure offers a great workout
979000	981000	And yeah, I think that game in particular
981000	984000	You know, that game was getting kind of hard to find anyway
984000	986000	And you hit the nail on the head
986000	991000	Like some people, like I do go outdoors once in a while
991000	996000	And I go to parks and I still play my GPS games like Orna and Ingress and stuff
996000	1000000	But I find that I'm going to the same parks and the same places
1000000	1002000	And it's getting a little dry for me
1002000	1005000	So Ring Fit Adventure is something a little bit kind of like different I think
1005000	1009000	You know, you're working your way, it's digitally different but it's still something different
1009000	1011000	And then of course they added that music game mode
1011000	1013000	Right after the last direct
1013000	1015000	That kind of added something to it as well
1015000	1019000	So I think Ring Fit Adventure feels a lot different than taking a walk around that same neighborhood park
1019000	1022000	You've taken a trip around many, many times before
1022000	1024000	So yeah, SHG100Matt says
1024000	1028000	Folks can't go to the gym, Ring Fit offers a great alternative
1028000	1030000	Loki, let me go to you
1030000	1033000	What do you think is the Switch fever?
1033000	1036000	What is it that's making everybody crave one of these right now?
1036000	1039000	Because they can't have it so then they want it
1039000	1043000	I don't know, I think it's just
1043000	1048000	It's popular, I don't see Animal Crossing as a system seller but
1048000	1050000	I don't know
1050000	1054000	I really would think it would be a different game or something like that
1054000	1056000	But I don't know
1056000	1058000	I don't know what the
1058000	1061000	I think people finding maybe more time to play games now
1061000	1064000	And so they decided that they want to get Switch
1064000	1067000	Maybe we're hearing more about the Switch because
1067000	1070000	Xbox and Playstation 4 are so easy to get
1070000	1073000	And I would normally agree with you that
1073000	1077000	Animal Crossing I would not have thought would have been a game that would be a system seller
1077000	1080000	In any other, that doesn't mean it's a bad game
1080000	1082000	I just wouldn't have seen it as something that moved
1082000	1084000	I mean there's always going to be the hardcore fans
1084000	1088000	But I would have seen it as something that moved a lot of systems in any other circumstance
1088000	1091000	But in this particular world circumstance now I'm like
1091000	1093000	Oh it kind of is though
1093000	1096000	Yeah and I don't even know necessarily it's just because Animal Crossing came
1096000	1098000	I mean I think it's just the timing in general
1098000	1103000	And I think it's because Nintendo has historically had a poor
1103000	1109000	They've done a poor job at fulfilling orders for their systems
1109000	1111000	And yeah I know they're blaming it on the COVID stuff now
1111000	1114000	But let's be honest I mean they're going to blame it on everything
1114000	1116000	I just don't
1116000	1121000	It'd be interesting to see like the actual numbers of how many systems have been sold
1121000	1125000	I mean I know Nintendo does well and I'm not just going to say that
1125000	1127000	I don't think it's dramatically different
1127000	1129000	I just think that because now everybody's
1129000	1133000	The demand has gone up that now they're having supply issues again
1133000	1135000	Whereas I'm not sure
1135000	1139000	I assume that the demand's gone up across the board for all systems
1139000	1144000	But I think that they're able to handle their supply a little bit better maybe
1144000	1145000	I don't know
1145000	1148000	But I'd be curious to see how the other systems fare as well
1148000	1153000	Yeah I think Animal Crossing 2 is very different from a Zelda
1153000	1156000	Very different from a Mario Party or Mario Kart
1156000	1158000	That's already on the Switch
1158000	1162000	Because I think Animal Crossing is a game where you know
1162000	1164000	As Dark Sakura was kind of explaining with her old roommate
1164000	1168000	You can kind of get together and do things in a space
1168000	1171000	Whereas you know that's not really what you're doing in Mario Kart
1171000	1174000	I mean yes you can play that game online with friends or Splatoon even
1174000	1177000	I mean that doesn't make those games bad at all
1177000	1179000	They're great for what they are
1179000	1182000	But they're not like existing in the same space
1182000	1185000	And building this space together that's almost like
1185000	1189000	Fulfilling this need that many of us are not getting in the real world right now
1189000	1192000	It's something very specific about that game
1192000	1195000	In many ways Nintendo could not have timed it any better
1195000	1198000	And I know that sounds like a really crass thing to say
1198000	1201000	And nobody would have ever wished this situation on anything
1201000	1205000	But it's just how the pieces fell for this particular game and this circumstance
1205000	1208000	And it's really worked out in this game's favor
1208000	1210000	It is what it is
1210000	1213000	I sound like a horrible person when I'm saying it that way
1213000	1215000	But that's just the reality
1215000	1216000	You don't sound horrible at all though
1216000	1218000	That sounds absolutely accurate
1218000	1221000	I mean not that they purposefully timed it like this
1221000	1224000	But the timing was perfect
1224000	1227000	No one knew that there was going to be a pandemic
1227000	1231000	But the fact that this came out just at the right time
1231000	1234000	Has been a godsend for a lot of people's sanity
1234000	1237000	Yeah in many ways
1237000	1240000	And it's interesting as Bobby points out
1240000	1241000	They did delay it
1241000	1242000	It was a November game last year
1242000	1243000	And in many ways
1243000	1246000	I can't believe here we are now saying this
1246000	1248000	But thank god they delayed it
1248000	1249000	Right?
1249000	1251000	And I'm hoping
1251000	1254000	I know that there's another company that's hoping
1254000	1257000	To get the same kind of fire lit under their game
1257000	1259000	Because it's come out a while ago
1259000	1261000	And hasn't done very well
1261000	1262000	But now they're releasing it on Steam
1262000	1264000	And that's Fallout 76
1264000	1265000	It's finally coming to Steam
1265000	1266000	But
1266000	1269000	It's Fallout 76
1269000	1270000	Yeah
1270000	1272000	Number one it's Fallout 76
1272000	1275000	And I feel like most people have already made their judgement on that
1275000	1276000	I mean good luck to them
1276000	1278000	Well they have the Wastelanders expansion
1278000	1282000	And not to say they can never be good at some point
1282000	1283000	It's just
1283000	1286000	I'm gonna send my thoughts and prayers to Fallout 76
1286000	1288000	But the reality is
1288000	1290000	What it doesn't have that Animal Crossing has
1290000	1293000	I think is a sense of accessibility
1293000	1295000	And by that I mean like
1295000	1297000	Kids play Animal Crossing
1297000	1299000	It's very easy for adults
1299000	1302000	We have the famous grandma that plays Animal Crossing
1302000	1305000	And it's not that these folks can't play Fallout 76
1305000	1308000	Although I don't know if you know with the violence in that game
1308000	1310000	It may be appropriate for audiences
1310000	1313000	But it's just something about the accessibility
1313000	1315000	Of an Animal Crossing game versus a Fallout 76
1315000	1316000	Where it's like
1316000	1318000	Fallout 76 you'll never be glamour
1318000	1320000	Like you'll never be glamour Fallout
1320000	1321000	You never will
1321000	1323000	Animal Crossing has
1323000	1324000	That it factor
1324000	1325000	That X factor
1325000	1326000	That accessibility
1326000	1327000	That universal appeal thing
1327000	1328000	That like
1328000	1329000	I'm sorry Bethesda
1329000	1331000	But Fallout 76 doesn't have it
1331000	1332000	Now for a certain audience
1332000	1333000	And a certain group
1333000	1334000	And certain people
1334000	1337000	That will you know turn their nose up at Animal Crossing
1337000	1339000	And yes Fallout 76 will play to that audience
1339000	1341000	But the reality is it's not as big of an audience
1341000	1342000	So there's
1342000	1344000	Yeah I figured as much yeah
1344000	1345000	Yeah
1345000	1348000	Well and I've got Dan back into playing Animal Crossing
1348000	1350000	Which he had no interest in since
1350000	1352000	You know the GameCube one
1352000	1355000	Where you had all your NES games in there
1355000	1357000	And he and I have been
1357000	1359000	I've been though
1359000	1362000	Whoring him out to you know pay off all of my
1362000	1364000	You know bridges and inclines and stuff
1364000	1366000	By making his own tarantula island
1366000	1368000	But for him I think he's
1368000	1370000	Found some things in it very therapeutic
1370000	1372000	So it's brought people back into that
1372000	1374000	That fandom too
1374000	1377000	And the fan art community has been a delight
1377000	1379000	I am all about the stock market
1379000	1380000	I am all about
1380000	1381000	Stonks
1381000	1382000	The stonks
1382000	1383000	Turnips
1383000	1385000	I heard you like turnips
1385000	1387000	Because I am that person that like
1387000	1389000	I have a little group chat with like
1389000	1390000	Shane and some of the other people
1390000	1392000	I play Fallout SE 14
1392000	1394000	And like just before noon in the AM
1394000	1397000	I have this picture of Tom Nook holding a gun
1397000	1400000	It's like it's the gun meme where somebody's holding a gun to the camera
1400000	1402000	And it's Tom Nook holding a gun
1402000	1404000	It says give me your turnip prices
1404000	1407000	Because I'm trying to find where I can sell those turnips
1407000	1410000	And right now I have a turnip room in my house
1410000	1414000	And it's only barely enough to hold all the turnips right now
1414000	1416000	So everybody kind of has their different way of playing
1416000	1418000	I don't like to do the tarantula game
1418000	1420000	But everybody has their different way of doing it
1420000	1422000	For me it's all about turnips
1422000	1424000	About turnips for one reason
1424000	1426000	To get ants
1426000	1428000	Because that's how you get ants is you have to leave your turnips out
1428000	1430000	And the ants are cute
1430000	1433000	But then Dan took my ants and I went back and the ants were gone
1433000	1434000	And I was so mad
1434000	1435000	And Sia Tabiri says
1435000	1437000	I finally got into turnips this morning
1437000	1438000	Yeah and that's
1438000	1440000	I love like talking to people going to the different groups
1440000	1441000	What's your turnips, what's your turnips, what's your
1441000	1443000	Hey I heard you like turnips
1443000	1444000	But what I don't like
1444000	1445000	And I'm gonna be downright honest
1445000	1447000	What I don't care for is like
1447000	1451000	I read this article about how somebody set up
1451000	1454000	A security team on their island
1454000	1456000	That would block the door to nooks
1456000	1458000	Until you like left a tip
1458000	1460000	That you'd I guess promise to give
1460000	1462000	All this like crazy stuff
1462000	1463000	And I'm like that ain't it
1463000	1465000	For me I mean if that's how you want to play
1465000	1467000	Hey it's your game do what you like
1467000	1470000	But for me like I don't believe in tipping
1470000	1471000	In Animal Crossing
1471000	1473000	In the real world completely different
1473000	1474000	But in Animal Crossing no no no
1474000	1476000	It's about the exchange of
1476000	1478000	You know you scratch my back I'll scratch yours
1478000	1479000	And I had
1479000	1480000	And this person has friends
1480000	1482000	What society should be like in Animal Crossing
1483000	1486000	You know what Bernie Sanders
1486000	1488000	Bernie Sanders ran on a turnip platform
1491000	1492000	And look what happened
1492000	1493000	Alright anyway
1493000	1495000	But I will say this
1495000	1498000	You know I've started a Facebook Animal Crossing group
1498000	1502000	That grew much bigger than I thought it was gonna be
1502000	1504000	But everybody there
1504000	1506000	I have to give them credit
1506000	1508000	Everyone there has been a delight
1508000	1511000	Everyone has put out public codes for everyone
1512000	1515000	And these are the kind of people that I like to play with
1515000	1517000	And I encourage everyone just to be
1517000	1520000	You know don't make it a burden for other people
1520000	1522000	Help each other out you know
1522000	1524000	And then play that into real life please
1524000	1525000	We need it
1525000	1526000	Yeah for sure
1526000	1528000	Yeah and like when my turnips were going for 90
1528000	1531000	Like they were selling last week at 90
1531000	1533000	I was just like yeah open up come visit
1533000	1534000	Cause then I was like yay people will visit
1534000	1536000	And if they write on my board
1536000	1538000	Or they talk to my villagers
1538000	1540000	And that's reward enough for me
1540000	1545000	So but I understand some people have a more capitalistic approach
1545000	1547000	To things
1547000	1549000	Gosh maybe I was a democratic socialist this whole time
1549000	1551000	And didn't realize I don't know
1551000	1553000	I'll throw something out there too Rob
1553000	1555000	Because you know and not
1555000	1557000	People I guess just don't actually realize this
1557000	1559000	But if you've held something in your inventory
1559000	1562000	You can order it later as long as it was a DIY
1562000	1565000	So that's what Gwen and I have been doing every day
1565000	1568000	Is that we'll find something we're not sure if the other person has
1568000	1570000	And we order each other our music
1570000	1572000	Well I did that for you
1572000	1573000	You needed the meme shirt
1573000	1574000	Yeah we did
1574000	1575000	Yeah so I sent you the meme shirt
1575000	1577000	And then I immediately took it over to Gwen
1577000	1579000	So she could put it in her inventory for five seconds
1579000	1580000	And I could get it back
1580000	1581000	I'm all about that that's cool
1581000	1584000	And so that way we've been you know
1584000	1585000	If someone wants something
1585000	1588000	Yeah maybe you can't pay the 64,000 bells for an arcade machine
1588000	1590000	But you can hold it for five seconds
1590000	1592000	And save up for one for yourself
1592000	1594000	But I will say this and I think we're starting to bleed into our
1594000	1596000	Video game weeks a little bit
1596000	1597000	So I'll advance the ticket over here
1598000	1600000	But I will say this much
1600000	1602000	As far as like all that stuff goes
1602000	1608000	Is that I don't really open my island to everybody
1608000	1611000	Because and I think one of the big drawbacks about Animal Crossing is
1611000	1614000	Surprise surprise Nintendo's mediocre online system
1614000	1618000	Because it takes like freaking two minutes
1618000	1620000	For somebody to get to your island
1620000	1622000	And another two minutes for them to leave
1622000	1624000	And that can be like let's imagine
1624000	1627000	Just imagine my turnips are selling for 530
1627000	1629000	One day just imagine
1629000	1631000	And I go to Twitter and I write
1631000	1633000	Hey my island's open
1633000	1634000	My turnips are 530
1634000	1636000	People are never gonna get in
1636000	1638000	Because every 30 seconds
1638000	1639000	Bing bing bing
1639000	1640000	Please close the window
1640000	1642000	A person's trying to connect
1642000	1644000	And it would just be crazy
1644000	1646000	That's why I only open my island with dodo codes
1646000	1648000	So that I know who's coming
1648000	1650000	I have it controlled to a certain number
1650000	1652000	And then like I don't have to worry about that
1652000	1654000	Connecting and disconnecting message every 30 seconds
1654000	1657000	It is the most annoying thing they need to fix
1657000	1659000	Big time
1659000	1663000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat talking about his experience with Animal Crossing
1663000	1665000	Saying the fun part with me
1665000	1667000	Is that my wife is playing more than I do
1667000	1669000	And we have one physical cart
1669000	1671000	So we can't play at the same time
1671000	1673000	She's unemployed so she's playing a lot
1673000	1676000	And I get like an hour or two a night before my shop's closed
1676000	1678000	Well we all play at our different pace
1678000	1680000	Like Dark Soccer came to visit me this week
1680000	1682000	At Animal Crossing
1682000	1684000	And she's like, where's your Able Sisters?
1684000	1686000	And I'm like, don't have it
1688000	1690000	I've been doing things at my pace
1690000	1692000	I'm like, I think I still need to build somebody a home
1692000	1694000	I don't know
1694000	1695000	And she was like, oh
1695000	1697000	My kids use it for Minecraft
1697000	1699000	And so I never get it
1699000	1702000	Yeah but it's just, I've been playing 14 and near
1702000	1705000	And 7 Remake and other stuff I'll talk about shortly
1705000	1708000	So it's like, I've just been playing Animal Crossing at my own pace
1708000	1710000	And like I said, I'm all about the turnips
1710000	1712000	I want to have my basement
1712000	1714000	Because if Dark Soccer isn't going to have a shrine to fire
1714000	1716000	Then I will, in my basement
1716000	1718000	No, I have my bonfire
1718000	1720000	Once I finish getting my townhouse planned up
1720000	1723000	I'm going to be, well I've got my Stonehenge right?
1723000	1726000	And I'm going to put fire all around my Stonehenge
1726000	1728000	With my cherry trees in the background
1728000	1731000	And we also don't have any bridges or anything leading to it
1731000	1734000	So my animals can't go, you know, mess it up
1734000	1736000	So, yeah
1737000	1739000	And I have Baphomet Point, don't forget about that
1739000	1740000	Where my lighthouse is
1740000	1741000	That's right
1741000	1743000	You know, and to be fair
1743000	1745000	I also kind of want like a
1745000	1748000	I don't know if I want to say a sex dungeon in the basement
1748000	1750000	But like a pervert dungeon
1750000	1752000	I think is what I want in the basement of my house
1752000	1756000	So, you know, I'll be thinking about that
1756000	1761000	Because I'm that sicko that likes to do things you really shouldn't do in cutesy games
1761000	1762000	What can I say?
1762000	1764000	Should I order you the bondage outfit then that they have in the game?
1764000	1766000	Oh, do they have one? Yes
1766000	1768000	Because today I got that
1768000	1770000	I got that human skeleton that like you could
1770000	1773000	It's like the anatomy thing
1773000	1774000	Yeah
1774000	1776000	Yeah, I thought that would be funny
1776000	1778000	Do you need like the actual skeleton?
1778000	1780000	You know, if you poke at it, it raises its arms like it's trying to scare you
1780000	1782000	Oh yeah, I knew one of those, send me one of those
1782000	1785000	Okay, I can order tomorrow, so yeah
1785000	1788000	We'll talk about that later, but I'll send you the bondage outfit too
1788000	1790000	Let's talk about the rest of our gaming weeks
1790000	1792000	I mean, clearly Animal Crossing has played a big part in our weeks
1792000	1794000	Just like everybody else's
1794000	1796000	DarkSakura, would you care to continue?
1796000	1798000	How was your gaming week? Animal Crossing or otherwise?
1798000	1800000	Animal Crossing
1800000	1802000	All the Animal Crossing
1802000	1807000	And actually, my lungs have been doing a lot better
1807000	1808000	Yay
1808000	1812000	So I've actually considered getting Yoga Master for the Switch
1812000	1818000	Just to give myself a little bit more motivation to get up and do my morning yoga
1818000	1820000	So, you know, I'm not all stiff and terrible
1820000	1825000	And hopefully do that to, you know, get my breathing back where it was
1825000	1827000	You know, like I said, it's better
1827000	1831000	But I moved like three bags of dirt that I got at Target
1831000	1833000	Because, you know, I'm planting my apocalypse garden
1833000	1836000	And, oh, I was a mess right after that
1836000	1841000	So yeah, I'm hoping that having like a yoga game on my Switch
1841000	1846000	Will, you know, help me get back into doing my breathing exercises and all that
1846000	1849000	Kind of sounds like it's trying to hit on that Wii Fit market
1849000	1851000	That doesn't totally exist on the Switch right now
1851000	1853000	Although, I mean, there's Ring Fit certainly
1853000	1855000	But Ring Fit doesn't really have a yoga in it
1855000	1860000	So, which was probably the most popular and well-known element of Wii Fit
1860000	1864000	If we got a Wii Fit, though, that would be absolutely amazing
1864000	1867000	Because I think I would play the hell out of it
1867000	1870000	You know, again, just because of not being able to get up
1870000	1873000	You know, I've got free weights in the house that I could be using
1873000	1877000	But while I'm healing up and my lungs aren't as strong
1877000	1881000	Doing yoga and certainly, you know, doing it in a game
1881000	1884000	Would probably be easier and more enjoyable
1886000	1888000	Alright, anything else with your gaming week?
1890000	1892000	I, no
1892000	1894000	Alright, then we'll go to Loki
1894000	1896000	How was your gaming week?
1896000	1899000	So, this week I didn't play a ton of things
1899000	1903000	I did end up playing some Final Fantasy VII Remake
1903000	1904000	So, I'm not very far in it
1904000	1907000	I'm about just an hour and a half or so into it
1907000	1910000	So, I think just in the middle of Chapter 2
1910000	1912000	And I'm liking it so far
1912000	1914000	I think it's pretty amazing
1914000	1916000	Just an incredible looking game
1916000	1919000	And I remember Nelly was going
1919000	1921000	Like, is this a game?
1921000	1923000	She's like, it looks so real
1923000	1925000	But yeah, it was fun
1925000	1928000	I tried to get my kids to watch because I thought it'd be interesting for them to watch
1928000	1931000	But they only had the attention span for like five minutes
1933000	1934000	But, what else?
1934000	1937000	I also played a little bit more Beat Saber
1939000	1941000	I did a little bit of Step Mania
1941000	1943000	I've been going through my song list
1943000	1946000	And trying to pare down some of the songs I have on there
1946000	1949000	And try to remove duplicates that I have in folders
1949000	1951000	Because I just dumped a whole bunch of collections together
1951000	1953000	So, I've been going through that
1953000	1957000	And also, I repaired my Nintendo Switch this week
1957000	1961000	So, I had Drift on the two Joy-Cons
1961000	1963000	So, I actually got the parts from iFixit
1963000	1965000	And took them apart
1965000	1968000	The Joy-Cons replaced the analog sticks in them
1968000	1974000	And then I was having an issue where I kept saying my SD card was being removed from the system
1974000	1975000	Even though it wasn't
1975000	1977000	So, I took the system apart
1977000	1981000	And the way they engineered that thing is so stupid
1981000	1985000	It's literally being held in by a little bit of foam
1986000	1993000	And the tension from the actual back of the device is pushing this connection down
1993000	1997000	And so, it can come loose if your child then drops it on the ground
1997000	2001000	So, literally all I had to do was push it back in the connector
2001000	2004000	And then everything was fine
2004000	2006000	But the fact that it's not like held in
2006000	2010000	It's not like a ribbon cable or something that's attached in there
2010000	2012000	It's just like this little thing that's held on by pressure
2012000	2014000	It's absolutely stupid
2015000	2018000	At least I know if it ever breaks it's easier to replace
2018000	2020000	So, I did all that this week
2020000	2026000	And then I've been just kind of getting my laptop still set up for gaming and stuff
2026000	2031000	I got an external drive reader for my 5TB drive from my old laptop
2031000	2034000	I tried fixing my old one but I think it's shot
2034000	2036000	And then I got a brand new 2TB one
2036000	2039000	So, I got like 8TB of storage on my PC now
2039000	2040000	It's great
2040000	2042000	I'm putting tons of games on there
2043000	2045000	So, that's been my week
2045000	2047000	Okay, awesome
2047000	2051000	Well, enjoy filling up the 8TB drive with games you'll never play
2051000	2052000	Absolutely
2052000	2053000	Okay
2053000	2054000	My gaming week
2054000	2057000	Let's talk about Final Fantasy VII Remake
2057000	2059000	Because I'm also playing it
2059000	2061000	And I'm on chapter 6
2061000	2063000	We have it on order by the way
2063000	2064000	Well, here's the thing
2064000	2067000	So, I was supposed to get it on Tuesday
2067000	2069000	Because Amazon's running behind
2069000	2071000	I get a lot of my stuff from Amazon
2071000	2073000	And they're running a little behind
2073000	2075000	And I really was okay with it
2075000	2079000	But then when everybody was getting the hype going on Twitter
2079000	2080000	And all that stuff
2080000	2081000	And I was thinking about
2081000	2082000	I don't really have a lot to do this weekend
2082000	2083000	I was like, you know what?
2083000	2084000	Fuck it
2084000	2085000	I'm just gonna buy it digital
2085000	2087000	Even though, yeah
2087000	2088000	So, I did it
2088000	2090000	I hit the button and I bought digital
2090000	2091000	And I'm actually kind of glad I did
2091000	2094000	Because it's been able to fill quite a bit of time this weekend
2094000	2096000	Maybe about like 7 hours in
2096000	2097000	I don't know
2097000	2099000	I'd probably play more if I had a better attention span
2099000	2100000	But I'm very much like
2100000	2102000	I sit in front of the TV for an hour
2102000	2104000	Then I need to go sit in front of the computer for an hour
2104000	2105000	And then maybe I need to go like
2105000	2107000	Go in the backyard for just a little bit
2107000	2108000	To get some fresh air or something
2108000	2112000	Like, I can't really just keep staying in one place
2112000	2113000	For hours and hours and hours
2113000	2114000	Like I used to be able to
2114000	2116000	When the original Final Fantasy VII came out
2116000	2119000	But anyway, I have played through a good chunk of the game at this point
2119000	2121000	I mean, I don't know how many chapters there are
2121000	2123000	But I'm up to chapter 6
2123000	2125000	Obviously, I'm not gonna spoil anything
2125000	2127000	Let's talk about that to begin with
2127000	2128000	Because you might think
2128000	2130000	Well, Rob, how can you spoil things
2130000	2132000	Because this is just a remake of Final Fantasy VII
2132000	2134000	So it's the same plot, right?
2134000	2135000	Wrong
2135000	2137000	There are a lot of things
2137000	2139000	That people are getting very wrong about this game
2139000	2141000	And I'm going right for it
2141000	2142000	One of them
2142000	2144000	That you guys are getting really wrong
2144000	2145000	And when I say like you guys
2145000	2146000	I mean like Twitter
2146000	2148000	And some of the, you know, hot takes, trademarks
2148000	2149000	So forth about the game
2149000	2151000	Is the hot take that I see
2151000	2154000	I do not want to buy that game
2154000	2157000	Because it's only 10% of the story
2157000	2162000	You are completely going about that assessment the wrong way
2162000	2163000	Period
2163000	2166000	It is not a one for one remake
2166000	2170000	You're thinking probably of a remaster
2170000	2172000	You're thinking of that game that you wanted
2172000	2175000	When you saw that PlayStation 3 demo
2175000	2178000	That rendered the opening sequence of the game in high definition
2178000	2179000	All those years ago
2179000	2181000	That first led people to talking about
2181000	2183000	They wanted a Final Fantasy VII in HD
2183000	2185000	Let me be clear
2185000	2188000	This is not that game
2188000	2190000	This is a different game
2190000	2192000	And I think maybe part of the problem
2192000	2194000	Is that they called it Final Fantasy VII Remake
2194000	2196000	Because this is Final Fantasy Reimagined
2196000	2199000	This is Final Fantasy VII Reinvention
2199000	2200000	This is
2200000	2202000	They took the plot and they took the characters
2202000	2204000	And they made a brand new game out
2204000	2206000	They made Final Fantasy XVI out of it
2206000	2207000	Is what they did
2207000	2209000	This is what should have been
2209000	2210000	Well in a way
2210000	2212000	But you couldn't do this game on the PlayStation
2212000	2213000	Full stop
2213000	2214000	As long as that bitch dies
2214000	2216000	As long as there are guys I'm happy
2216000	2217000	Well and who knows
2217000	2220000	And I don't think that part would be covered in this game
2220000	2223000	But I really feel like anything goes with the plot
2223000	2224000	I have her
2224000	2226000	Obviously I want this to be a spoiler free place
2226000	2229000	I have heard the ending is shocking
2229000	2231000	Which it shouldn't be shocking
2231000	2232000	If you've played through the original
2232000	2234000	So apparently they've done something
2234000	2237000	But it wouldn't surprise me
2237000	2241000	Because they have done all this different stuff along the way
2241000	2244000	One of the things is that they have completely fleshed out these characters
2244000	2246000	Who were very much
2246000	2248000	I don't want to say throwaway sidekicks
2248000	2249000	But they were just
2249000	2251000	They were not really a part of the story before
2251000	2254000	I'm speaking mainly of Jesse, Biggs, and Wedge
2254000	2259000	Who are completely fleshed out full characters
2259000	2260000	They're not playable
2260000	2263000	But I'll be damned if you're going to tell me they're not a part of the story
2263000	2265000	Because they very much are in this game
2265000	2266000	And you know
2266000	2270000	Again this is not a one for one of the original Final Fantasy VII
2271000	2272000	What this is
2272000	2274000	Think of it more like this
2274000	2276000	And I can't think of a better comparison
2276000	2277000	Maybe you guys can
2277000	2281000	Final Fantasy VII is like Buffy the Vampire Slayer the movie
2281000	2283000	A nice two hour movie
2283000	2285000	Stands on its own
2285000	2287000	There's things people appreciate about it
2287000	2290000	Everybody loves that sequence with Pee Wee Herman as the vampire
2290000	2293000	There's Buffy the Vampire Slayer the movie
2293000	2295000	Then years later
2295000	2298000	There's Buffy the Vampire Slayer the TV show
2298000	2300000	It goes on for seven seasons
2300000	2302000	You know what it's the same character
2302000	2305000	And some of the themes they explore are the exact same thing
2305000	2307000	But it's very very different
2307000	2310000	That is Final Fantasy VII Remake
2310000	2312000	I don't know what do you guys think
2312000	2314000	Is that a fair comparison?
2316000	2317000	Anyone?
2317000	2320000	I haven't watched the Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie
2320000	2322000	Now you spoil it for me
2322000	2324000	You need to fix that
2324000	2325000	I can see that
2325000	2327000	I can see that except
2327000	2329000	No cause
2329000	2330000	I don't know
2330000	2332000	Maybe not directly that
2332000	2335000	Because yeah the plot of the movie doesn't really go over to the TV show
2335000	2337000	But I couldn't really think of a movie
2337000	2341000	The only other thing I can think of is that The Shining was a movie
2341000	2343000	And then they had the mini series
2343000	2345000	With Rebecca De Mornay and some other guy
2345000	2347000	What about more like V?
2348000	2350000	Oh that's a good one
2350000	2352000	We had V the mini series
2352000	2354000	And then it tried to flesh it out
2354000	2358000	I'm gonna tell you the TV series kind of jumped the shark a bit later
2358000	2362000	But I can kind of see what the TV series was trying to do
2362000	2364000	Oh MASH
2364000	2366000	Good one Pod Culture
2366000	2368000	I don't know if as many people know about
2368000	2370000	I hate to say it but know about MASH
2370000	2371000	Let's be real
2371000	2373000	The 20 year olds may not
2373000	2375000	May not have familiarity with MASH
2375000	2377000	Like those of us in our 40's
2377000	2379000	When the reruns were on all day long
2379000	2381000	But MASH is a good
2381000	2383000	If you know MASH that's an excellent example actually
2383000	2384000	So anyway
2384000	2386000	I think you all kind of get what I'm saying
2386000	2388000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says
2388000	2390000	Game Spots Review had the best line
2390000	2393000	For returning fans this isn't the Final Fantasy 7 your mind remembers
2393000	2396000	It's the one your heart always knew it to be
2396000	2398000	Tigerclaw says
2398000	2400000	Is the story in the Final Fantasy 7 remake
2400000	2402000	Verbatim from the original
2402000	2405000	All the same story beats and stuff that made the original impactful
2405000	2407000	No
2407000	2409000	And I'll leave it at that
2409000	2411000	So
2411000	2413000	Tigerclaw says
2413000	2415000	Remakes often do things different from the original
2415000	2417000	Stuff like origins of characters being different
2417000	2419000	The fate of certain characters being different
2419000	2421000	It's how they differentiate from the original
2421000	2423000	And I will say
2423000	2425000	And again I don't want to spoil
2425000	2427000	Because I want to be very
2427000	2429000	You know very aware that maybe not everybody
2429000	2431000	Some of you probably ordered from Amazon
2431000	2433000	Haven't got the game yet
2433000	2435000	But if you've played the demo
2435000	2437000	Which is available out there for everybody
2437000	2439000	You'll notice that the end of the demo
2439000	2441000	Is something very very explicit
2441000	2443000	That was only
2443000	2445000	Implied in the original game
2445000	2447000	And wasn't necessarily
2447000	2449000	Explicitly stated
2449000	2451000	The way it was very clearly done
2451000	2453000	At the end of the demo
2453000	2455000	For those that have played it you'll know exactly what I'm talking about
2455000	2457000	For those that haven't, well maybe that will make you interested
2457000	2459000	I don't know
2459000	2461000	But I kind of think playing that demo will give you a good sense
2461000	2463000	Of the types of changes they can make to the game
2463000	2465000	For one it will give you a feeling of the combat
2465000	2467000	Which the combat is
2467000	2469000	Very different and not everybody's going to love it
2469000	2471000	Again
2471000	2473000	I know a lot of people are like
2473000	2475000	Oh there's a classic mode
2475000	2477000	It's really nothing like the original battle system
2477000	2479000	I'm sorry to say
2479000	2481000	I don't know I kind of think it's fun
2481000	2483000	I like the new battle system
2483000	2485000	I'm playing it on easy, granted
2485000	2487000	Because I really wanted to focus on the story
2487000	2489000	And I kind of felt okay I'll do one play through on easy
2489000	2491000	And in the back of my mind I'm going
2491000	2493000	This game's going to come out on Playstation 5
2493000	2495000	Oh that was the other reason I went digital
2495000	2497000	At the end of the day
2497000	2499000	I went digital because my thought was
2499000	2501000	If Playstation 5 will play Playstation 4 games
2501000	2503000	Then hypothetically
2503000	2505000	Fingers crossed, toes crossed
2505000	2507000	We don't know this for sure
2507000	2509000	But I'm hoping Sony does the right thing
2509000	2511000	And that means your digital library on Playstation 4
2511000	2513000	Will instantly unlock on Playstation 5
2513000	2515000	Probably
2515000	2517000	That's my hope anyway
2517000	2519000	I hope Sony gets that right
2519000	2521000	So my thought is
2521000	2523000	I'm going to play through it on easy now
2523000	2525000	And if I have to replay it on Playstation 5
2525000	2527000	I'll play it on either normal or hard then
2527000	2529000	So that's kind of my other thought
2529000	2531000	Process that went to that
2531000	2533000	But I think the battle mode is
2533000	2535000	Kind of fun
2535000	2537000	It's like an improved version of 15
2537000	2539000	To me
2539000	2541000	And I know that might make a lot of people wince
2541000	2543000	Because I know 15's battle system wasn't popular
2543000	2545000	But that's why I say improved version of 15
2545000	2547000	To me
2547000	2549000	I feel like there's more point to some of the buttons that you're mashing
2549000	2551000	And it doesn't have all that crazy teleporting stuff
2551000	2553000	That is weird
2553000	2555000	That is not there
2555000	2557000	But I really like how when you do pause the battle to use fire
2557000	2559000	To use magic
2559000	2561000	It's really cool how everything moves in bullet time slow motion
2561000	2563000	And that just adds to the flair
2563000	2565000	This game has
2565000	2567000	This game has so much flair
2567000	2569000	And I talked about this with the demo
2569000	2571000	And there was a part of me that was like
2571000	2573000	I don't know how they can keep that going
2573000	2575000	Throughout the game
2575000	2577000	And there are some slower parts
2577000	2579000	Like there are some side quests that you do
2579000	2581000	That maybe don't have quite the flair
2581000	2583000	That the opening of the game does
2583000	2585000	It definitely fills in some of the back story
2585000	2587000	It makes, again, characters that were
2587000	2589000	Throwaway side characters in the original game
2589000	2591000	Have full on
2591000	2593000	Plot devices
2593000	2595000	In this game
2595000	2597000	And so forth, so there's that
2597000	2599000	But I would say maybe the game
2599000	2601000	Didn't have quite that intense flair
2601000	2603000	Moving through those side quests
2603000	2605000	And so forth, but I'm pretty impressed
2605000	2607000	When you're going through the main story
2607000	2609000	There's an energy that this game
2609000	2611000	Just doesn't stop
2611000	2613000	And I'll tell you
2613000	2615000	This shouldn't be a spoiler because this is a very well known
2615000	2617000	Sequence in the original game
2617000	2619000	The motorcycle sequence
2619000	2621000	It is reimagined and it's in this game
2621000	2623000	And it's another one of those
2623000	2625000	They do something kind of different to it
2625000	2627000	Where it's like, holy shit
2627000	2629000	This doesn't fucking stop
2629000	2631000	It's awesome
2631000	2633000	And again, if you've played it, you know what I'm talking about
2633000	2635000	If you haven't
2635000	2637000	Maybe in a few more months I'll feel a little
2637000	2639000	More at ease talking about some of these spoilers
2639000	2641000	Openly, but yeah
2641000	2643000	It's got a certain energy level that doesn't stop
2643000	2645000	And the graphics and the
2645000	2647000	Sound and music
2647000	2649000	They just, like Loki said
2649000	2651000	His wife thought it was a movie
2651000	2653000	Right? I mean, it just
2653000	2655000	With the camera tricks that it plays
2655000	2657000	It just feels like you're really playing a movie
2657000	2659000	It's fantastic
2659000	2661000	So
2661000	2663000	Fifth Dream Today in chat says
2663000	2665000	Biggs is Charlie Sheen
2665000	2667000	Circa 1986
2667000	2669000	Okay, but Charlie Sheen never
2669000	2671000	Had a voice as silky smooth
2671000	2673000	As Gideon Emery, who really adds
2673000	2675000	Everything to that character
2675000	2677000	It's so weird hearing him
2677000	2679000	Without a British
2679000	2681000	Accent
2681000	2683000	And I read a review on the game that said they
2683000	2685000	Couldn't unhear Balthier
2685000	2687000	And I'm like, I don't
2687000	2689000	If I really try to make myself hear that, I will
2689000	2691000	But, or Orangé in Final Fantasy 14
2691000	2693000	Uh-uh, uh-uh
2693000	2695000	You know what's always for me?
2695000	2697000	It's Dragon Age 2
2697000	2699000	Of course
2699000	2701000	I always hear Fenris
2701000	2703000	And if you really want to hear that, you will
2703000	2705000	But I'm able to kind of let Biggs be
2705000	2707000	His own character, so it's pretty cool
2707000	2709000	He's cute
2709000	2711000	Yeah, and you know
2711000	2713000	Barret Jesse
2713000	2715000	Barret in the demo
2715000	2717000	Definitely has that
2717000	2719000	Same kind of hard edge
2719000	2721000	Hard ass Barret, but I think once you get past
2721000	2723000	The demo sequence
2723000	2725000	You start to see Barret's softer side
2725000	2727000	About why, I mean, especially when his daughter
2727000	2729000	Is introduced for the first time, which again, that was in the original game
2729000	2731000	And there, obviously
2731000	2733000	That element that Barret has
2733000	2735000	A daughter, is still in this remake
2735000	2737000	And you know, you start to see kind of like
2737000	2739000	More of the why is he doing what he's doing
2739000	2741000	And so forth, I think they really kind of start to
2741000	2743000	Develop him a lot
2743000	2745000	Better than just like
2745000	2747000	The Mr. T clone he was in the
2747000	2749000	Original game, they really kind of like
2749000	2751000	Flesh him out a lot more
2751000	2753000	And especially some of the support, like
2753000	2755000	I will admit, I was never really on
2755000	2757000	The Tifa bandwagon in the original game
2757000	2759000	But I really
2759000	2761000	Like her in this
2761000	2763000	I really, really like what they have done with her character
2763000	2765000	Because she's
2765000	2767000	She's a strong, bad ass
2767000	2769000	Fucking woman
2769000	2771000	And she's great in this game
2771000	2773000	And then they really fleshed out
2773000	2775000	Jesse, Biggs, and Wedge to be
2775000	2777000	Their own characters
2777000	2779000	Jesse's a little
2779000	2781000	I don't know, I have mixed feelings on Jesse
2781000	2783000	But I think she means well
2783000	2785000	I just don't like boob armor
2785000	2787000	Yeah, yeah
2787000	2789000	But yeah
2789000	2791000	I just like
2791000	2793000	I could go on and on and probably talk for three hours
2793000	2795000	About just this game, but I'm really enjoying it
2795000	2797000	And I think this game is
2797000	2799000	Absolutely going to come up
2799000	2801000	When we talk about end of the year lists
2801000	2803000	The one other thing I wanted to say about it
2803000	2805000	Is that everybody's talking about
2805000	2807000	What's going to be Final Fantasy 7 Remake
2807000	2809000	Episode 2, or what's going to
2809000	2811000	What's going to happen there
2811000	2813000	There's a weird part of me
2813000	2815000	That wonders if there's necessarily
2815000	2817000	Going to be one
2817000	2819000	I feel like they're going to do it just to
2819000	2821000	Kind of cash in on it and to get the money for it
2821000	2823000	But a game like that's going to take a long time to develop
2823000	2825000	And if this game truly stands
2825000	2827000	On its own, which I fully
2827000	2829000	Believe it will
2829000	2831000	Will they need to do a second game?
2831000	2833000	Well, I think it will take less time
2833000	2835000	Because now that they have the engine
2835000	2837000	It's more just
2837000	2839000	Creating the assets for it
2839000	2841000	All the recordings and everything
2841000	2843000	Whereas a lot of the time
2843000	2845000	From the initial development of this game
2845000	2847000	Was developing the engine
2847000	2849000	It would run and all that
2849000	2851000	So now that they have the tech in place
2851000	2853000	I think making more content for it is not going to be that difficult
2853000	2855000	You mean it's not just running in 15's engine?
2855000	2857000	Because I think it's running in 15's engine
2857000	2859000	I think it's different in 15
2859000	2861000	One other thing too
2861000	2863000	Because I like to spoil things for myself
2863000	2865000	Before other people do it
2865000	2867000	There's going to be another
2867000	2869000	Ok, so that tells me
2869000	2871000	They left the door open for more
2871000	2873000	At the point where it ends there must be more
2873000	2875000	Because that's only scratching the surface of the story
2875000	2877000	Ok, interesting
2877000	2879000	Alright, well we'll see what happens
2879000	2881000	And maybe it is going to be something where
2881000	2883000	Final Fantasy 13 had 13-2
2883000	2885000	Lightning Returns
2885000	2887000	What are they going to call it? Final Fantasy 7 Remake 2
2887000	2889000	I guess it will have to be the name of it
2889000	2891000	I don't know what they're going to call it
2891000	2893000	This will be very interesting
2893000	2895000	Chapter 2 Part 2
2895000	2897000	Chapter 2 is probably a better name for it
2897000	2899000	But we'll see
2899000	2901000	Except aren't all the in-game things chapters themselves
2901000	2903000	So maybe it would be
2903000	2905000	We have volume 1 because then you have your chapters
2905000	2907000	Of your one book
2907000	2909000	And you have volume 2 which is
2909000	2911000	Tigerclaw in chat says
2911000	2913000	Rob, now that you've played the remake
2913000	2915000	How would you rate it?
2915000	2917000	Is it better than the original?
2917000	2919000	I'm not fully comfortable answering that question
2919000	2921000	Until I actually beat the game so I can have
2921000	2923000	Had the full experience of both games
2923000	2925000	But as it stands now
2925000	2927000	I'm going to find it very
2927000	2929000	Difficult to compare the two
2929000	2931000	Because I think the Final Fantasy 7
2931000	2933000	Original game was
2933000	2935000	An amazing game for
2935000	2937000	Its time
2937000	2939000	But now this remake is showing us
2939000	2941000	There's so much more
2941000	2943000	There's going to be all these people that complain that
2943000	2945000	Final Fantasy 7 was just really a mediocre
2945000	2947000	Game and didn't really stand the test of time
2947000	2949000	Here's everything this game
2949000	2951000	Could have been
2951000	2953000	Is almost I feel like the game I'm
2953000	2955000	Playing now or here if I could go back
2955000	2957000	And do it over here's what I do
2957000	2959000	Differently I almost feel like
2959000	2961000	Is the game I'm playing now and so it's
2961000	2963000	It's almost like apples to oranges
2963000	2965000	A little bit or maybe not like apples to oranges
2965000	2967000	But like apples to applesauce
2967000	2969000	Like I don't
2969000	2971000	It's just I don't know if I'm ever going to be comfortable
2971000	2973000	Answering that question because Final Fantasy 7
2973000	2975000	Is great for its time
2975000	2977000	And it's even a game
2977000	2979000	That I would recommend as an RPG classic
2979000	2981000	Today but the remake is just
2981000	2983000	Different I don't know if I would say play
2983000	2985000	This or that I would say play this
2985000	2987000	And that can we rewind
2987000	2989000	To 20 year old Jamie for a moment
2989000	2991000	Please who did not own
2991000	2993000	A Playstation yet owned a copy of Final
2993000	2995000	Fantasy 7
2995000	2997000	Playing it on her roommate's Playstation
2997000	2999000	And you know
2999000	3001000	The whole Knights of the Round quadramagic
3001000	3003000	Blah blah blah making a sandwich you know
3003000	3005000	But I had
3005000	3007000	Three and a quarter discs and I had
3007000	3009000	A box full of them that was nothing but
3009000	3011000	Vincent fan art
3011000	3013000	Because reasons
3013000	3015000	I played I've beaten that
3015000	3017000	Game so many times I still
3017000	3019000	Have a working save file
3019000	3021000	Where Aerith gets you know
3021000	3023000	Skewered which is beautiful
3023000	3025000	And then it goes right into the Jenova fight which is one of my
3025000	3027000	Favorite pieces of music in the game too
3027000	3029000	And you know
3029000	3031000	It's
3031000	3033000	This was like my thing
3033000	3035000	This was one of my
3035000	3037000	It's been a while I go through
3037000	3039000	Phrases where I'll get something that's like my huge ass
3039000	3041000	Fandom this was my Mass Effect
3041000	3043000	Back then
3043000	3045000	And I am super excited
3045000	3047000	To play this one or to
3047000	3049000	You know have me and Dan play it together
3049000	3051000	You know do our take turn things whenever we do
3051000	3053000	But
3053000	3055000	I think I'm going to love this
3055000	3057000	As much as I love the original because
3057000	3059000	I love the characters so much I love the story
3059000	3061000	So much and for me
3061000	3063000	I
3063000	3065000	I'm looking forward to drawing my own comparisons
3065000	3067000	But I don't think I think they're each going to
3067000	3069000	Stand alone as their own just from the impression I've been
3069000	3071000	Getting from everybody agree and I think
3071000	3073000	I think also at a very important point about
3073000	3075000	This remake there's a lot that
3075000	3077000	Could have gone wrong with this remake
3077000	3079000	They could have easily fucked this game
3079000	3081000	Up easily
3081000	3083000	They didn't and I think that deserves
3083000	3085000	Applause
3085000	3087000	At least the parts that I've played they didn't
3087000	3089000	There's very there's even even if they completely
3089000	3091000	Decide to take the story in a 180 or whatever
3091000	3093000	There's very little that's going to make me
3093000	3095000	Change my mind on that I think they
3095000	3097000	There's a lot that could have gone wrong and it really does
3097000	3099000	Seem like it didn't and they've done a very good job
3099000	3101000	And it's interesting because now it has a lot of people
3101000	3103000	Talking about what about Final Fantasy 8
3103000	3105000	Are they going to do a remake of Final Fantasy 8
3105000	3107000	And there's a part of me that's like
3107000	3109000	No we don't need to go back and remake
3109000	3111000	All the old Playstation games
3111000	3113000	Like make a Final Fantasy 16
3113000	3115000	Already but there's also
3115000	3117000	A part of me that's like you know what
3117000	3119000	And I've taken a lot of shit on the show for this opinion
3119000	3121000	But it's my opinion dammit
3121000	3123000	Final Fantasy 8 is my least favorite
3123000	3125000	Final Fantasy game save the original
3125000	3127000	Version of Final Fantasy 14 which was
3127000	3129000	Which was hot garbage
3129000	3131000	Final Fantasy 8 is my least
3131000	3133000	It's my least
3133000	3135000	See I disagree but that's okay everybody's got their own rankings
3135000	3137000	Final Fantasy 8 is my least favorite and it's because
3137000	3139000	It's not because of the story so for those of you
3139000	3141000	That want to fight me on the story it's not
3141000	3143000	That's not the reason I find Final Fantasy 8
3143000	3145000	Unplayable because of
3145000	3147000	The junction draw
3147000	3149000	And that whole battle system
3149000	3151000	How the monsters level up with you
3151000	3153000	Which was the worst part of Final Fantasy 2
3153000	3155000	And just everything in that battle mechanics
3155000	3157000	Everything in that system sucks
3157000	3159000	And I hate it and I can't
3159000	3161000	Play the game because of it but now
3161000	3163000	I'm thinking well wait a minute
3163000	3165000	If they go back and do Final Fantasy 8
3165000	3167000	Then they get to keep what's good
3167000	3169000	The story and they get to redo
3169000	3171000	What's not good the battle system
3171000	3173000	So from that perspective
3173000	3175000	Bring it on you know what
3175000	3177000	This Final Fantasy 8 hater says
3177000	3179000	I would like to see that actually
3179000	3181000	Yes remake 8 do it
3181000	3183000	Because maybe that's actually gonna help
3183000	3185000	In a lot of ways with some of my own
3185000	3187000	Issues about Final Fantasy 8 so
3187000	3189000	Anyway and yes I
3189000	3191000	Realize so many people
3191000	3193000	Have their opinions on Final Fantasy 8
3193000	3195000	And that's fine
3195000	3197000	S2100 Matt in chat says
3197000	3199000	This is a perfect example of
3199000	3201000	People will forget the endless delay
3201000	3203000	If the game is done well
3203000	3205000	Poorly done delayed games become the butt
3205000	3207000	Of jokes forever
3207000	3209000	Kudos to that remark and this game
3209000	3211000	Again with all the
3211000	3213000	Flare and the strong art direction
3213000	3215000	In this game and just how this
3215000	3217000	Game dances as you play it
3217000	3219000	You see where five years worth of
3219000	3221000	Work went into this game
3221000	3223000	You see it
3223000	3225000	This game clearly took a long time to make
3225000	3227000	Anyway again I can talk for three
3227000	3229000	Hours about the Final Fantasy 7 remake but I should probably
3229000	3231000	Move on with other headlines
3231000	3233000	Other games I've played this week I've continued on Final Fantasy 14
3233000	3235000	My Dancer hit level 80
3235000	3237000	And I did play more Nier Automata
3237000	3239000	Until the 7 remake came out
3239000	3241000	And I actually got as far as
3241000	3243000	I got past that amusement park
3243000	3245000	Level and I got to do the boss at the end of the
3245000	3247000	Amusement park again I'm trying to not
3247000	3249000	Super spoil although that game's been out a little bit
3249000	3251000	Longer but that was a real
3251000	3253000	For me that was a really hard boss
3253000	3255000	At the end of that so
3257000	3259000	That game is very challenging
3259000	3261000	But again I talked highly about
3261000	3263000	That game last week I love the kind of like
3263000	3265000	Hybrid shooter slash action
3265000	3267000	Game that Nier gives
3267000	3269000	Y'all were right on Nier
3269000	3271000	I said it on Twitter I'll say it again
3271000	3273000	I missed out so I
3273000	3275000	Should go back and I will
3275000	3277000	Go back and finish Nier once I'm done
3277000	3279000	With Final Fantasy 7 remake
3279000	3281000	And then now somebody's saying but Persona
3281000	3283000	Rob you got to finish Persona 2
3283000	3285000	Yeah that's another one of those games where I feel like
3285000	3287000	Yeah I really need to revisit
3287000	3289000	That because that's another one of those games where like
3289000	3291000	I feel like you all
3291000	3293000	Are telling me this and I've been resisting
3293000	3295000	Well I've been resisting I just haven't had the time to play it
3295000	3297000	And I'll probably end up
3297000	3299000	Falling in love with that one too so we'll see
3299000	3301000	So alright
3301000	3303000	Let's move on we have a lot of gaming news
3303000	3305000	We want to cover tonight and get to that
3305000	3307000	So let's start off with
3307000	3309000	Lowkey with some gaming news
3309000	3311000	Alright so let's talk
3311000	3313000	A little bit about the
3313000	3315000	Side Xbox
3315000	3317000	Event that they did well not event
3317000	3319000	But like they had their little
3319000	3321000	Stuff that they show off the new
3321000	3323000	Games coming out so there's actually some pretty
3323000	3325000	Cool interesting things here
3325000	3327000	So one of them of course
3327000	3329000	Is a game called
3329000	3331000	Grounded which is a survival
3331000	3333000	Horror game or not make not
3333000	3335000	Survival game but imagine
3335000	3337000	Any survival game set in the universe of
3337000	3339000	Honey I Shrunk the Kids so basically
3339000	3341000	You're shrunk down to the size of
3341000	3343000	Tiny little
3343000	3345000	I guess microscopic
3345000	3347000	Characters and then of course
3347000	3349000	Bugs and plants and everything are
3349000	3351000	Giant and you're kind of like in a backyard
3351000	3353000	Or something it's sim ant
3353000	3355000	I love that game
3355000	3357000	But it's but the answer
3357000	3359000	Are much you know the
3359000	3361000	Insects are much bigger than you are so
3361000	3363000	I'm not sure what your scale
3363000	3365000	Is similar to like you know Honey I Shrunk
3365000	3367000	Kids or something like that
3367000	3369000	So they have that what I thought was interesting
3369000	3371000	Because you know there's people there deathly afraid
3371000	3373000	Of spiders so they have an arachnophobia
3373000	3375000	Setting that you can put on
3375000	3377000	So that you don't encounter spiders
3377000	3379000	Which I thought was interesting
3379000	3381000	So they showed off that
3381000	3383000	They also
3383000	3385000	Were talking about a
3385000	3387000	Game called Forza Street which is
3387000	3389000	Headed to Android and iOS
3389000	3391000	And
3391000	3393000	So that's kind of interesting
3393000	3395000	Because they couldn't just let Mario Kart
3395000	3397000	Be
3397000	3399000	Somebody at Microsoft was like how do we get a piece
3399000	3401000	Of that
3401000	3403000	No I'm all about it I'm for it
3403000	3405000	And then they talked a little bit about
3405000	3407000	Of course
3407000	3409000	Minecraft Dungeons is going to be releasing
3409000	3411000	At the end of May on the 26th
3411000	3413000	Journey to the Savage Planet
3413000	3415000	Is getting
3415000	3417000	An expansion called Hot Garbage
3417000	3419000	Which I thought was hilarious
3419000	3421000	And that's coming out
3421000	3423000	This week on the 15th
3423000	3425000	Then of course they talked a little bit about
3425000	3427000	Gears Tactics
3427000	3429000	Some of the new characters in that
3429000	3431000	Talked a little bit about
3431000	3433000	Hotline Miami Collection
3433000	3435000	Which is going to be coming out on
3435000	3437000	Xbox One at some point
3437000	3439000	Atomic Crops
3439000	3441000	That's coming out on
3441000	3443000	May 28th
3443000	3445000	And then they were talking a little bit about
3445000	3447000	Sea of Thieves is getting another update
3447000	3449000	On April 22nd called the Ships of Fortune
3449000	3451000	Which has an expanded
3451000	3453000	Reputation system
3453000	3455000	They have overhauled the competitive mode
3455000	3457000	And new cosmetics
3457000	3459000	As well as cats
3459000	3461000	That's of course important
3461000	3463000	That's the most important thing
3463000	3465000	Yes
3465000	3467000	And then of course a little bit about Games Pass
3467000	3469000	Journey to the Savage Planet
3469000	3471000	Football Manager 2020
3471000	3473000	We're going to be coming to Games Pass
3473000	3475000	For Xbox One and PC
3475000	3477000	Last week and then Mistover
3477000	3479000	And Stranger Things 3 the game
3479000	3481000	Are coming to PC Game Pass
3481000	3483000	Sometime in the future as well as the Human
3483000	3485000	Fall Flat expansion
3485000	3487000	Thermal
3487000	3489000	Evolstia Chronicles
3489000	3491000	And Yakuza Kiwami are going to be
3491000	3493000	Available on both platforms
3493000	3495000	As well soon
3495000	3497000	And then they touched on
3497000	3499000	Xbox Series X
3499000	3501000	Seeing the games can be stored on an external
3501000	3503000	Hard drive
3503000	3505000	They can be moved to internal memory
3505000	3507000	Or the official
3507000	3509000	Expansion drives in order to play them
3509000	3511000	I think this is kind of similar to what they were
3511000	3513000	Talking about with even the PlayStation 5
3513000	3515000	Saying that those drives
3515000	3517000	Have to be of a certain spec
3517000	3519000	In order to be able to run them efficiently
3519000	3521000	To be able to load everything
3521000	3523000	How you're supposed to so I think that's probably
3523000	3525000	Going to be similar with the Xbox
3525000	3527000	Where you need a fast enough drive to run
3527000	3529000	I wonder if it's like
3529000	3531000	It's an archival storage
3531000	3533000	Like a workplace or something
3533000	3535000	Where emails that are more than
3535000	3537000	Six months old go to
3537000	3539000	An archive and they take a
3539000	3541000	Lot longer to load because basically
3541000	3543000	You're going back retrieving it and bringing it over
3543000	3545000	To the current one so maybe that's kind of
3545000	3547000	Like what this is
3547000	3549000	It allows you to have a place to store the game
3549000	3551000	So you don't have to download it again if you're worried about
3551000	3553000	Bandwidth issues or things like that but it basically
3553000	3555000	Has to bring it over and copy
3555000	3557000	It back onto the drive so you
3557000	3559000	Can play it from the super fast
3559000	3561000	D drive maybe that's kind of what it sounds like
3561000	3563000	Like it's literally a localized
3563000	3565000	Backup storage type of thing
3565000	3567000	And then of course they were also
3567000	3569000	Saying that several countries
3569000	3571000	In western Europe
3571000	3573000	Project xCloud as well
3573000	3575000	And Dragon Age Inquisition
3575000	3577000	Unravel 2 and Sims 4
3577000	3579000	Are now playable through that service
3579000	3581000	Yeah I still
3581000	3583000	Want to check out xCloud so hopefully I'll get to it
3583000	3585000	At some point but Xbox Game Pass is
3585000	3587000	Continuing to be a great feature
3587000	3589000	I'm really happy to see what Microsoft's
3589000	3591000	Been doing with that I've been getting a lot of
3591000	3593000	My value out of that
3593000	3595000	During this quarantine period so
3595000	3597000	Yeah I kind of want to see
3597000	3599000	What's on the PC one because
3599000	3601000	That sounded interesting
3601000	3603000	Yeah and I did do the
3603000	3605000	Preload for Minecraft which is so weird
3605000	3607000	Preload but that's what it is for
3607000	3609000	Minecraft Dungeons because that gets like
3609000	3611000	It's Minecraft but it's Diablo and I like
3611000	3613000	Both of those things especially Diablo
3613000	3615000	So I'm really curious about that game
3615000	3617000	Yeah I'll probably pick that up as well
3617000	3619000	I do want to play that so
3619000	3621000	We'll have to play together then
3621000	3623000	Hey there's a Minecraft we'll play together for sure
3623000	3625000	Absolutely
3625000	3627000	Heck yeah
3627000	3629000	Good job by Microsoft this week on like a little bit
3629000	3631000	Of an update during this weird time
3631000	3633000	They were all, like Major Nelson was in his house
3633000	3635000	Phil Spencer was in his house
3635000	3637000	Everybody was kind of at home
3637000	3639000	Kind of looked like that episode of Saturday Night Live
3639000	3641000	If you saw that this week
3641000	3643000	This is very strange, this is different
3643000	3645000	Well I watch a lot of clips of
3645000	3647000	Late shows
3647000	3649000	And so everybody's been kind of doing that
3649000	3651000	Kind of weird
3651000	3653000	As well
3653000	3655000	Hopefully they kind of expand out
3655000	3657000	Just making fun of the usual
3657000	3659000	Stuff that we have to deal with
3661000	3663000	I don't know
3663000	3665000	It was okay
3665000	3667000	The weird one for me is that guy on
3667000	3669000	CNN who actually
3669000	3671000	Has COVID
3671000	3673000	Who's still working
3673000	3675000	Because it kind of goes
3675000	3677000	And he's doing it from his basement and everything
3677000	3679000	So it's not like he's putting anybody else at risk
3679000	3681000	But you're not supposed to go to work when you're sick
3681000	3683000	And you're going to work
3683000	3685000	I mean yes you're working out of your basement
3685000	3687000	But rest dude I don't know
3687000	3689000	That's the only one that's a little weird to me
3689000	3691000	Because it kind of goes against the message of
3691000	3693000	You're not supposed to work when you're sick
3693000	3695000	And I get that he's in his own house
3695000	3697000	And he's not putting anybody else at risk
3697000	3699000	And maybe it's what he wants to do
3699000	3701000	I think he shouldn't but okay
3701000	3703000	So anyway
3703000	3705000	Moving on
3705000	3707000	Let's talk a little bit about this story again
3707000	3709000	And you might think Rob haven't you talked about this before
3709000	3711000	And yes this topic has come up on the show before
3711000	3713000	Especially in this current situation
3713000	3715000	It has to do with
3715000	3717000	Coronavirus slash COVID-19
3717000	3721000	And the World of Warcraft pandemic experience
3721000	3723000	Why are we talking about it again?
3723000	3727000	Because it hit the mainstream press again this week
3727000	3729000	And it's actually out of the Washington Post
3729000	3731000	So it's a pretty big
3731000	3733000	Mainstream media coverage about what's going on here
3733000	3735000	And it was talking a little bit about
3735000	3737000	And it was actually written
3737000	3739000	I think the person that wrote the article
3739000	3741000	For the Washington Post
3741000	3743000	Is like somebody who
3743000	3745000	I don't think they're a doctor
3745000	3747000	But they know a lot about the technological
3747000	3749000	Ends of things and so forth
3749000	3751000	And have a lot of insight to what
3751000	3753000	Is true in that scenario
3753000	3755000	And how that kind of plays out
3755000	3757000	With what's going on with COVID-19
3757000	3759000	And so a lot of the Washington Post article
3759000	3761000	Kind of talked about the Corrupted Blood incident
3761000	3763000	Which I think a lot of you are familiar with
3763000	3765000	At this point, long story short
3765000	3767000	There was a raid boss
3767000	3769000	Who would poison you
3769000	3771000	But people figured out how to basically
3771000	3773000	Take that poison from the boss fight
3773000	3775000	And take it into the real world
3775000	3777000	So to speak, not the real world
3777000	3779000	But you know what I mean like the towns and so forth
3779000	3781000	And Warcraft so that that poison would
3781000	3783000	Spread throughout the towns and so forth
3784000	3786000	And it killed NPCs too
3786000	3788000	It did, it would kill NPCs, it would play
3788000	3791000	Regular PCs of a different level and so forth
3791000	3793000	Ironforge and Orgrimmar
3793000	3795000	They were overrun within hours
3795000	3797000	NPCs would get it
3797000	3799000	And then pass it on to other players and so forth
3799000	3801000	So kind of interesting
3801000	3803000	All the parallels there
3803000	3805000	And there was even a paper that the article refers to
3805000	3807000	That was published in 2007 that talks about
3807000	3809000	Their findings and so forth
3809000	3811000	But what I find is interesting about this
3811000	3813000	Is the kind of summaries
3813000	3815000	That this whole thing makes
3815000	3817000	And so they reached out for some
3817000	3819000	Comment about that
3819000	3821000	Article in the current research
3821000	3823000	About COVID-19
3823000	3825000	So the doctor that did this
3825000	3827000	Let's see, it was Nina Fefferman
3827000	3829000	Who played World of Warcraft at the time of the incident
3829000	3831000	Has some comments about that
3831000	3833000	On the current COVID-19 situation
3833000	3835000	Saying
3835000	3837000	What I do is I study all the aspects
3837000	3839000	Of infectious disease outbreaks
3840000	3842000	We really saw the full gamut of behaviors
3842000	3844000	We see in the real world reflected in the
3844000	3846000	Player characters during Corrupted Blood
3846000	3848000	There are games where you are encouraged
3848000	3850000	To behave in a way that you would never behave
3850000	3852000	Offline
3852000	3854000	You really have to know the game
3854000	3856000	Play it and understand the culture
3856000	3858000	So you can make these kind of determinations
3858000	3860000	That yeah, this is a pretty good proxy
3860000	3862000	And then
3862000	3864000	This actually was a quote
3864000	3866000	From the other doctor that was a colleague
3866000	3868000	Of Nina Fefferman's
3868000	3870000	critic Lofgren who said
3870000	3872000	Oh, I'm sorry, no, this was
3872000	3874000	Sorry, I'm doing this on the fly here
3874000	3876000	There's two doctors, they're quoting back and forth
3876000	3878000	But Nina Fefferman said this and I thought this was a great quote here
3878000	3880000	It's not just that
3880000	3882000	People were role playing
3882000	3884000	People were being themselves
3884000	3886000	And I thought that was a very
3886000	3888000	Kind of like harrowing
3888000	3890000	Quote about the whole situation
3890000	3892000	Is that in World of Warcraft
3892000	3894000	Although there are role playing
3894000	3896000	Servers and so forth
3896000	3898000	People can go role play as another character
3898000	3900000	The reason why this disease
3900000	3902000	Was spreading and so forth
3902000	3904000	Was not the result of somebody role playing
3904000	3906000	Or wanting to do something different
3906000	3908000	They were doing what they wanted to do
3908000	3910000	And I think they're drawing some
3910000	3912000	Parallels in this situation
3912000	3914000	In that situation
3914000	3916000	To what's going on in the COVID-19 situation
3916000	3918000	Where we all know
3918000	3920000	We've seen it in the news
3920000	3922000	How some people are not respecting what's going on
3922000	3924000	With social distancing right now
3924000	3926000	Meaning that they are above this virus
3926000	3928000	Which does not discriminate
3928000	3930000	Against people based on
3930000	3932000	Whatever factor you can think of
3932000	3934000	And especially today
3934000	3936000	Being a day of religious notoriety for some
3936000	3938000	You've all seen the news
3938000	3940000	About how some people
3940000	3942000	Don't care
3942000	3944000	They believe it's not going to affect them
3944000	3946000	And we'll see how that plays out I suppose
3946000	3948000	But it's just very interesting
3948000	3950000	In those comparisons
3950000	3952000	That people were not role playing
3952000	3954000	They were just being themselves
3954000	3956000	Dicks
3956000	3958000	What's that?
3958000	3960000	They were being dicks
3960000	3962000	And people in the real world can be dicks
3962000	3964000	We heard about
3964000	3966000	There was the guy in New Jersey
3966000	3968000	Who they had to arrest
3968000	3970000	Because he was going out well knowing he had the virus
3970000	3972000	And purposely infecting other people
3972000	3974000	Or the people that are recording TikTok videos
3974000	3976000	Of themselves coughing on all the produce
3976000	3978000	To the supermarket going I've got COVID
3978000	3980000	And even though they're lying about it
3980000	3982000	Fuck them
3982000	3984000	They've actually arrested
3984000	3986000	Quite a number of people for doing that
3986000	3988000	As well as those pastors
3988000	3990000	Who are like we're going to hold services
3990000	3992000	Fuck you
3992000	3994000	Actually the real heroes have been the landlord
3994000	3996000	That changed locks on one of those churches here in Sacramento
3998000	4000000	As much as landlords
4000000	4002000	Have been taking a beating on a lot of other things
4002000	4004000	That is landlord done well
4004000	4006000	In that circumstance
4006000	4008000	Azet in chat says
4008000	4010000	There's going to be a spike in about a week
4010000	4012000	Gosh I hope not
4012000	4014000	But you're probably right
4014000	4016000	Tigerclaw says
4016000	4018000	Another excellent example
4018000	4020000	And that happens in MMOs a lot
4020000	4022000	People will buy up the things they know
4022000	4024000	Are going to be in demand for the next patch
4024000	4026000	This just happened in Final Fantasy 14
4026000	4028000	Which is a game I play a lot of Materia
4028000	4030000	Because these relic weapons just came out
4030000	4032000	And they have all these materia slots
4032000	4034000	So people were buying up the materia for cheap
4034000	4036000	Then the patch drops and they're reselling it high
4036000	4038000	That's what people do in the real world too
4038000	4040000	You all heard the stories about the people
4040000	4042000	Soaking up the sanitizer
4042000	4044000	And the toilet paper
4044000	4046000	I know you all saw that one guy who had the warehouse
4046000	4048000	Or the politicians
4048000	4050000	Selling their stocks
4050000	4052000	Yes that too
4052000	4054000	It's interesting and I thought
4054000	4056000	It was worthy bringing up again
4056000	4058000	Even though we've talked about the pandemic
4058000	4060000	Especially hearing that from a doctor
4060000	4062000	That people were behaving
4062000	4064000	In this game just the way they would in real life
4064000	4066000	And seeing these types of comparisons
4066000	4068000	Like you would think oh no people wouldn't troll people like that
4068000	4070000	And then it's like
4070000	4072000	Fuck but they are though
4072000	4074000	They are
4074000	4076000	And so yeah there's a lot you can learn
4076000	4078000	From what happened in World of Warcraft
4078000	4080000	So
4080000	4082000	SSJ100Matt says if you don't believe in this virus
4082000	4084000	Or think it's a joke come to New York City
4084000	4086000	It's not great and it's sad
4086000	4088000	And just
4088000	4090000	Sorry I almost get choked up just thinking about it
4090000	4092000	I was just there in New York City
4092000	4094000	And obviously you know
4094000	4096000	I was there six months ago is nothing compared to
4096000	4098000	Being there right now and living amongst it
4098000	4100000	But just know I am
4100000	4102000	Thinking of y'all and I love that city
4102000	4104000	And I love the people and just
4104000	4106000	You know but that
4106000	4108000	That is as they say just the first place
4108000	4110000	You're gonna see this type of thing hit
4110000	4112000	Other cities and especially in these places
4112000	4114000	Where people can't seem to follow the goddamn rules
4114000	4116000	And I'm just very
4116000	4118000	Thankful whereas
4118000	4120000	It was extraordinarily frustrating
4120000	4122000	Maybe to be the first date
4122000	4124000	Where they said nope shut it down
4124000	4126000	No restaurants no bars and so forth
4126000	4128000	Maybe it was a little fresh but now in retrospect
4128000	4130000	I think most people in California
4130000	4132000	And the San Francisco Bay Area
4132000	4134000	And the greater San Francisco Bay Area
4134000	4136000	Are very thankful for that right about now
4136000	4138000	I think we're all very thankful for that
4138000	4140000	So anyway I don't want to speak out of turn
4140000	4142000	But anyway
4142000	4144000	Alright
4144000	4146000	So my thoughts
4146000	4148000	Really go out to you guys in New York City
4148000	4150000	And just know that I love you
4150000	4152000	And keep that distance
4152000	4154000	But hold through
4154000	4156000	We're all in it together
4156000	4158000	And we'll all
4158000	4160000	Hopefully get through this
4160000	4162000	Stay the fuck home
4162000	4164000	I am really happy that California
4164000	4166000	Sent ventilators there
4166000	4168000	Because they saw the need
4168000	4170000	Was lessening here at least for right now
4170000	4172000	And they sent that and that is great
4172000	4174000	I'm so proud of my state for doing that
4174000	4176000	Well Rob we are a nation state
4176000	4178000	We are a nation state according to our governor
4178000	4180000	That was a very
4180000	4182000	Anyway I don't want to get political
4182000	4184000	That was a very interesting power play
4184000	4186000	And although I am
4186000	4188000	I know this is a weird thing to say
4188000	4190000	But you guys know my mom passed a few years ago
4190000	4192000	And in many ways
4192000	4194000	I'm so thankful she didn't have to see this
4194000	4196000	Because she was such a worrier
4196000	4198000	This situation would have been
4198000	4200000	So terrible for her mental health
4200000	4202000	That like
4202000	4204000	I'm just thankful she
4204000	4206000	Didn't have to go through this
4206000	4208000	But the reason why I bring it up is that she
4208000	4210000	She loved Gavin Newsom
4210000	4212000	And that would be the one thing
4212000	4214000	She would be up and watching his
4214000	4216000	Press conferences every single day
4216000	4218000	I tell you that
4218000	4220000	Political fangirling?
4220000	4222000	She was
4222000	4224000	She said she was going to write him in
4224000	4226000	On the presidential ballot one year
4226000	4228000	I don't know if she actually did it
4228000	4230000	I love your mom
4230000	4232000	I miss her everyday
4232000	4234000	Let's go further down that
4234000	4236000	Let's change the topic quickly
4236000	4238000	And talk about a different story
4238000	4240000	DarkSakura, more gaming news
4240000	4242000	So in other news
4242000	4244000	We are getting more information about
4244000	4246000	The Playstation 5 in the form of
4246000	4248000	It's new controller
4248000	4250000	DualShock? Screw that
4250000	4252000	We have the DualSense
4252000	4254000	And I'm looking at this thing
4254000	4256000	Holding my hands up
4256000	4258000	At scale using distance
4258000	4260000	And everything
4260000	4262000	As people are
4262000	4264000	Saying it might
4264000	4266000	It makes me think of a Saturn controller
4266000	4268000	A little bit of a Saturn
4268000	4270000	Almost like the
4270000	4272000	Saturn dual analog
4272000	4274000	You know
4274000	4276000	And it's not quite a boomerang
4276000	4278000	I'm just saying
4278000	4280000	I'm so glad you're making
4280000	4282000	Those comparisons
4282000	4284000	And keeping it old school
4284000	4286000	Because Twitter instantly lit up with
4286000	4288000	Oh it's Microsoft
4288000	4290000	I'm looking for Microsoft
4290000	4292000	It's Microsoft's controller
4292000	4294000	And I'm going like what?
4294000	4296000	What?
4296000	4298000	The D-pad and the analog aren't even in the same fucking place
4298000	4300000	And if anything
4300000	4302000	It's shaped more like a Nintendo Switch Pro controller
4302000	4304000	I do not see the Microsoft comparison
4304000	4306000	Whatsoever
4306000	4308000	And to be honest
4308000	4310000	I really would
4310000	4312000	I'm looking at the back of it as well
4312000	4314000	At the curving on it
4314000	4316000	It actually seems like it would be quite comfortable to hold
4316000	4318000	Yeah
4318000	4320000	I can see where my fingers would fit
4320000	4322000	Holding the back behind it
4322000	4324000	I can see where my thumbs would fit
4324000	4326000	It looks like it could be a pretty good controller
4326000	4328000	If this is the design they stick with
4328000	4330000	But at any rate
4330000	4332000	And I honestly
4332000	4334000	I think it's about damn time
4334000	4336000	That they went to a different design
4336000	4338000	Although again though with the DualShock
4338000	4340000	If it ain't broke don't fix it
4340000	4342000	The DualShock was a pretty good controller
4342000	4344000	Although I have to say
4344000	4346000	It's not that different
4346000	4348000	All these are considered
4348000	4350000	Well and you know the problem I have with my wrist
4350000	4352000	I can actually though hold
4352000	4354000	My shift joy cons
4354000	4356000	In their little
4356000	4358000	Cradle without a lot of pain
4358000	4360000	So
4360000	4362000	But going back
4362000	4364000	I think the thing that's weirding people out about the controller
4364000	4366000	Is the bra
4366000	4368000	And if you don't know what I'm talking about
4368000	4370000	Look at that black shape
4370000	4372000	The odd black against white
4372000	4374000	The little
4374000	4376000	It's more of a tank top
4376000	4378000	But those little
4378000	4380000	Those little analog controllers are the boobies
4380000	4382000	But it's a bra
4382000	4384000	But anyway
4384000	4386000	Whatever Rorshark shape
4386000	4388000	You see in that controller
4388000	4390000	I think that's like the white against black
4390000	4392000	Well we all know you love boobs Rob
4392000	4394000	I do but that's the weird
4394000	4396000	Conflicting thing for some people
4396000	4398000	But I also say
4398000	4400000	Since the PlayStation 2 era
4400000	4402000	And probably before that Dreamcast
4402000	4404000	When has there ever been
4404000	4406000	Just one first party color
4406000	4408000	You know there's gonna be other
4408000	4410000	Colors so if the white on black bugs you that bad
4410000	4412000	Just there'll be others
4412000	4414000	Anyway sorry Darkshark I don't mean to interrupt
4414000	4416000	But I had to
4416000	4418000	At any rate
4418000	4420000	It's called the DualSense
4420000	4422000	Not DualShock 5
4422000	4424000	It was announced this past Tuesday
4424000	4426000	It has
4426000	4428000	Some different features like haptic feedback
4428000	4430000	Adaptive triggers
4430000	4432000	And a built in microphone
4432000	4434000	Which is interesting cause I mean
4434000	4436000	Gosh you know reading about the
4436000	4438000	Built in microphone kind of makes me think
4438000	4440000	Back to the old Famicom controllers
4440000	4442000	I thought pole voice from Zelda
4442000	4444000	Pole voice exactly
4444000	4446000	So
4446000	4448000	At any rate
4448000	4450000	It also is getting rid of the share
4450000	4452000	Button from the DualShock 4
4452000	4454000	Supposed to be replacing it with something
4454000	4456000	Different
4456000	4458000	And the good thing about haptic feedback
4458000	4460000	As opposed to just having like rumble
4460000	4462000	Especially you know
4462000	4464000	Think of it in terms of like
4464000	4466000	Say
4466000	4468000	Using your iPhone or you know
4468000	4470000	My Apple Watch for example how the feedback
4470000	4472000	Is a little bit different like for example
4472000	4474000	Excuse me when I do my breathe app
4474000	4476000	I get a different you know
4476000	4478000	Sensation for doing my breathing
4478000	4480000	And I think it's gonna be great we're gonna be able
4480000	4482000	To get all kinds of different levels
4482000	4484000	Of sensation from that
4484000	4486000	You also have the adaptive triggers and the
4486000	4488000	L2 and sorry
4488000	4490000	R2 buttons so you get tension
4490000	4492000	Like you know the example
4492000	4494000	From Nishino
4494000	4496000	Who is a senior vice president of
4496000	4498000	Platform planning and management at
4498000	4500000	Sony Interactive Entertainment
4500000	4502000	He's saying that you can feel
4502000	4504000	The tension of your actions like when drawing
4504000	4506000	A bow to shoot an arrow
4506000	4508000	So what they're replacing
4508000	4510000	That share button with is a create button
4510000	4512000	So
4512000	4514000	They don't have much in the way of information
4514000	4516000	About that but they said it'll come out
4516000	4518000	They want to create
4518000	4520000	Epic gameplay content that's a direct
4520000	4522000	Quote those three words
4522000	4524000	So then
4524000	4526000	As far as that
4526000	4528000	Microphone
4528000	4530000	They're doing it so that you can chat with your friends
4530000	4532000	Without a headset for jumping into
4532000	4534000	Quick conversation
4534000	4536000	But they're saying that if
4536000	4538000	You're gonna have like long term
4538000	4540000	Chat then you wanna use a headset
4540000	4542000	You know
4542000	4544000	It does still have that
4544000	4546000	Light bar but it's now
4546000	4548000	Hugging around
4548000	4550000	The left and right sides of
4550000	4552000	The touch pad
4552000	4554000	And the buttons
4554000	4556000	Are now monochrome instead of
4556000	4558000	Multicolored it's using like this clear buttons
4558000	4560000	With the grey icons
4560000	4562000	On top of it and it does have
4562000	4564000	A microphone mute button from the appearance
4564000	4566000	Of it so
4566000	4568000	And actually yeah there's an update
4568000	4570000	Very recently that says that the
4570000	4572000	Dual sense controller will have a built
4572000	4574000	In 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
4574000	4576000	Oh wow
4576000	4578000	So it's still gonna have that
4578000	4580000	They confirmed that on Twitter
4580000	4582000	That's my favorite part of the tool stock
4582000	4584000	Yeah that's kinda nice
4584000	4586000	That they're putting that technology right in there cool
4586000	4588000	And you know
4588000	4590000	The other thing too is that
4590000	4592000	I think it's going to
4592000	4594000	Do its
4594000	4596000	Charging
4596000	4598000	I think with a USB
4598000	4600000	Yeah dual sense charges with the USB C
4600000	4602000	With the port located on the top of the controller
4602000	4604000	Cool
4604000	4606000	There you go
4606000	4608000	Yeah that's great
4608000	4610000	Some comments from chat yeah Tigerclaw says
4610000	4612000	I bet the built in microphone will be used
4612000	4614000	So that when you plug in a regular headphone
4614000	4616000	You can just voice chat with the controller itself
4616000	4618000	Yeah Sony actually confirming that's pretty much
4618000	4620000	What it's for it's kinda interesting
4620000	4622000	I'm sure there's gonna be a lot of tin foilers that
4622000	4624000	Don't want their controller always listening
4624000	4626000	To them but I guess there is a mute button
4626000	4628000	On it and I guess you can always put tape
4628000	4630000	Over it if you don't like it I don't know
4630000	4632000	I want pew pew mode where you can just say pew pew pew
4632000	4634000	And have it shoot
4634000	4636000	You never know you never know
4636000	4638000	Let's see YYR says
4638000	4640000	Haptic feedback ugh why do they have to put that nonsense
4640000	4642000	In everything I don't know I kinda
4642000	4644000	I love haptic feedback I dig it in the phone
4644000	4646000	Although sometimes they overdo it
4646000	4648000	Some games and some things
4648000	4650000	Really overdo it on that
4650000	4652000	But I kinda dig like the way they use it
4652000	4654000	On the phone and I'm excited to see how that
4654000	4656000	Translates to cause obviously
4656000	4658000	On the trigger buttons that's gonna be very different
4658000	4660000	Than the phone right that's gonna be
4660000	4662000	A different kind of feeling so I'm kinda
4662000	4664000	I'll give it a shot sounds interesting
4664000	4666000	Well there's the big thing about
4666000	4668000	Haptic feedback
4668000	4670000	That I think is absolutely beautiful
4670000	4672000	Especially as we're dealing more with accessibility
4672000	4674000	These days like
4674000	4676000	I was reading a post from
4676000	4678000	Sturlok on Twitter not long ago
4678000	4680000	About being able to play
4680000	4682000	Animal Crossing without being sighted
4682000	4684000	And a lot of that comes in
4684000	4686000	With you know the sound effects
4686000	4688000	Like the sound design in Animal Crossing is tremendous
4688000	4690000	But with haptic feedback
4690000	4692000	You know you have a better idea
4692000	4694000	For you know say
4694000	4696000	You know
4696000	4698000	Say that you are getting
4698000	4700000	Footsteps
4700000	4702000	Near you
4702000	4704000	You know how sometimes depending on the floor you can feel them
4704000	4706000	Or someone breathing
4706000	4708000	And you might get just like a little
4708000	4710000	Little subtle rumble
4710000	4712000	When someone's breathing in the room with you
4712000	4714000	You know
4714000	4716000	Or you know you're
4716000	4718000	Say climbing like a rope in your game
4718000	4720000	And you get the feeling of the tension
4720000	4722000	Of the rope like have you ever been on
4722000	4724000	A rope when it's about to snap?
4724000	4726000	Or pulled something that's about to snap?
4726000	4728000	You kinda get that tension
4728000	4730000	And imagine having
4730000	4732000	Feedback when you're playing
4732000	4734000	A game that's just you know and for those of us
4734000	4736000	Who have I'd say
4736000	4738000	Full access to our senses
4738000	4740000	You know
4740000	4742000	Think about the immersion that you're
4742000	4744000	Gonna get with something like that
4744000	4746000	But I'm more thinking in terms of our
4746000	4748000	Friends who need more accessibility
4748000	4750000	I think it'll be great for them
4750000	4752000	And YYR is conceding that point in chat
4752000	4754000	Saying see I hate haptic feedback on my phone
4754000	4756000	First thing I did was turn it off but yeah I get that
4756000	4758000	It does make some things more accessible
4758000	4760000	And that is very good
4760000	4762000	And Mich in chat says
4762000	4764000	I usually turn haptic off because it messes
4764000	4766000	With the nerves in my hands
4766000	4768000	So yeah it just kinda might depend on you
4768000	4770000	And your body if this is something that is
4770000	4772000	Gonna work for you or not work
4772000	4774000	For you I also wanted to address this point
4774000	4776000	Cause I thought this was a when we talk about
4776000	4778000	That create button YYR says
4778000	4780000	If YouTubers are creators
4780000	4782000	What does that make the people actually
4782000	4784000	Creating games?
4784000	4786000	Artists in my opinion
4786000	4788000	But that's my
4788000	4790000	Answer maybe yours is different
4790000	4792000	I think this is our difference between
4792000	4794000	A professional like a patissier
4794000	4796000	And a home cook home baker
4796000	4798000	Or a pastry chef
4798000	4800000	Well that's what a patissier is
4800000	4802000	Yes I know I know for those
4802000	4804000	That may not know yes
4804000	4806000	Anyhow
4806000	4808000	Alright any other comments on the dual sense
4808000	4810000	Controller
4810000	4812000	It purred
4812000	4814000	Oh and then I will say this I think Loki
4814000	4816000	Had a story on this probably about two months
4816000	4818000	Ago where there was like a patent
4818000	4820000	Or something that had been filed on this
4820000	4822000	We kinda knew this haptic thing was coming
4822000	4824000	So you know for those that
4824000	4826000	Don't always like us covering the
4826000	4828000	Rumors and the unverified
4828000	4830000	Sometimes where there is smoke there is
4830000	4832000	Fire so we knew some of these things a couple months
4832000	4834000	Ago or at least we had a
4834000	4836000	I don't know if it was a patent
4836000	4838000	But they were
4838000	4840000	Just some of the features
4840000	4842000	That were gonna come to the controller
4842000	4844000	They just didn't show us what the controller looked like yet
4844000	4846000	I felt like there was some type of tech specifications
4846000	4848000	Whatever I like I know we talked about the
4848000	4850000	Haptic thing a couple months ago so it's kinda interesting
4850000	4852000	So anyway alright let's move on to the next story
4852000	4854000	Loki
4854000	4856000	Alright so
4856000	4858000	This is kinda cool so everybody is doing their part
4858000	4860000	To try to help
4860000	4862000	In the 2019 situation
4862000	4864000	You have folding at home
4864000	4866000	Allowing you to contribute in that sense
4866000	4868000	To try to find a
4868000	4870000	Cure
4870000	4872000	Well now Borderlands 3 is kinda jumping in on that
4872000	4874000	As well they have a thing called Borderlands
4874000	4876000	Science
4876000	4878000	A game that you can play within
4878000	4880000	Borderlands 3 through
4880000	4882000	In the Infirmary
4882000	4884000	In Sanctuary 3 which is the spaceship
4884000	4886000	In the game so
4886000	4888000	What it allows you to do is actually
4888000	4890000	Kind of like a
4890000	4892000	Block matching game
4892000	4894000	And apparently the puzzle
4894000	4896000	Game the way it works
4896000	4898000	It's basically
4898000	4900000	Allowing you to
4900000	4902000	Correct millions of small computer errors
4902000	4904000	That arise as scientists try to map
4904000	4906000	Microbiomes of the human gut
4906000	4908000	Apparently doing this will allow
4908000	4910000	You to allow them to
4910000	4912000	Better understand
4912000	4914000	Or have a better understanding of the human body
4914000	4916000	Which in turn benefits research and the conditions
4916000	4918000	Like obesity, diabetes and even depression
4918000	4920000	How does that
4920000	4922000	How does that work? Is that you
4922000	4924000	Actually playing the game is doing that?
4924000	4926000	Or is it that the game
4926000	4928000	Is so low
4928000	4930000	Doesn't tax so many
4930000	4932000	Resources on your system that it actually
4932000	4934000	Uses some other resources in the background
4934000	4936000	To do that other part
4936000	4938000	So what I think it is
4938000	4940000	Is it's basically
4940000	4942000	The computer does the matching
4942000	4944000	And then anything that it can't
4944000	4946000	Figure out it's allowing humans
4946000	4948000	To kind of look at
4948000	4950000	To try to figure stuff out
4950000	4952000	The game itself
4952000	4954000	It's kind of interesting looking
4954000	4956000	It's
4956000	4958000	It does look like
4958000	4960000	Kind of like a block matching game
4961000	4963000	I'm just trying to see
4963000	4965000	Like actually
4965000	4967000	How you match stuff together
4967000	4969000	I mean
4969000	4971000	It's interesting
4971000	4973000	It's interesting
4973000	4974000	S2100Matt in chat says
4974000	4976000	Oh how nice of Gearbox to come out with this feature
4976000	4978000	After hosting their employees on those
4978000	4980000	Performance bonuses
4980000	4982000	Yeah that's quite the
4982000	4984000	Retort although to be fair
4984000	4986000	It was probably those employees who actually made
4986000	4988000	This feature in the game so
4988000	4990000	You know
4990000	4992000	The other issue needs to be addressed
4992000	4994000	A little more at the top of the food chain
4994000	4996000	I believe so
4996000	4998000	Anyhow
4998000	5000000	That story aside
5000000	5002000	This is
5002000	5004000	I love these kind of like gamers doing good
5004000	5006000	Kind of like harnessing the power of
5006000	5008000	Games to do these other
5008000	5010000	Things is pretty neat
5010000	5012000	Yeah it's interesting
5012000	5014000	And it is
5014000	5016000	It's a little bit I mean it is still like
5016000	5018000	A match three type
5018000	5020000	But it's a little bit different
5020000	5022000	Arrows that you have
5022000	5024000	To basically insert at the bottom
5024000	5026000	Of your row to kind of move those rows up
5026000	5028000	To match three
5028000	5030000	And then it breaks them apart
5030000	5032000	So it's a little different but
5032000	5034000	It's interesting
5034000	5036000	And I guess with that you also get
5036000	5038000	weapons and stuff out of that
5038000	5040000	You earn the in game currencies
5040000	5042000	Alright
5042000	5044000	Well we'll have to check that out
5044000	5046000	I'll have to check it out I don't know
5046000	5048000	I don't know Borderlands 3 yet
5048000	5050000	Yeah I haven't played Borderlands 3 in a while
5050000	5052000	It's been on sale a lot
5052000	5054000	I'll have to look into it
5054000	5056000	Especially now it's off the Epic store
5056000	5058000	And it's available in more places so we'll see
5058000	5060000	Alright
5060000	5062000	Well anyhow moving on for now
5062000	5064000	Let's talk about Final Fantasy 14
5064000	5066000	A game I do play a lot of
5066000	5068000	And COVID-19 has had an impact
5068000	5070000	On Final Fantasy 14's development
5070000	5072000	Final Fantasy 14 has been on a pretty
5072000	5074000	Almost like clockwork it's release schedule
5074000	5076000	It's like they go X many a week
5076000	5078000	There's a patch then there's another patch
5078000	5080000	And then there's the expansion like everything is almost like clockwork
5080000	5082000	Which actually some people kind of criticize
5082000	5084000	14 about is that it's
5084000	5086000	Patch cycle almost gets too predictable
5086000	5088000	Like it's going to be a dungeon here and a raid here
5088000	5090000	And they don't tend to break that predictability
5090000	5092000	A lot well
5092000	5094000	The situation of what's going on in the real world
5094000	5096000	Is causing some things to get pushed back
5096000	5098000	Game director producer Naoki
5098000	5100000	Oshida put a
5100000	5102000	Update to the community this week about what's
5102000	5104000	Going on saying we are terribly sorry
5104000	5106000	For the disappointment this may cause our players
5106000	5108000	As we know you look forward to new patches
5108000	5110000	However it's also important to prioritize the physical
5110000	5112000	And mental health of our development team
5112000	5114000	Without whom we would never be able to release the
5114000	5116000	Quality updates and features you expect from Final Fantasy 14
5116000	5118000	So we ask under your
5118000	5120000	Ask for your understanding as we adjust our
5120000	5122000	Schedule in accordance with the situation
5122000	5124000	So basically talking about that this most
5124000	5126000	Recent patch most of the
5126000	5128000	Development was done for the fight because they just
5128000	5130000	Released a 5-2-5 patch
5130000	5132000	That was pretty much done right before they released
5132000	5134000	Or right before all this you know work at home
5134000	5136000	And all that kind of disrupted in Japan
5136000	5138000	So now this is going
5138000	5140000	To push some things back so they're
5140000	5142000	Basically saying 5-3 was going
5142000	5144000	To come out in June
5144000	5146000	It probably is going to miss that date
5146000	5148000	Due to the situation what's
5148000	5150000	Going on so you know
5150000	5152000	And he's got graphic designing
5152000	5154000	Teams in Asia, North America,
5154000	5156000	Europe and all over
5156000	5158000	So basically the game is going to
5158000	5160000	Have its content delayed for a month or two
5160000	5162000	And really quite an explicit
5162000	5164000	Apology there from Yoshida
5164000	5166000	To as somebody who's been playing Final Fantasy 14
5166000	5168000	Ever since the
5168000	5170000	Realm Reborn alpha
5170000	5172000	Let me say it's okay
5172000	5174000	We completely understand
5174000	5176000	Like it's really fine
5176000	5178000	Like do what the team
5178000	5180000	Has to do to
5180000	5182000	Take care of themselves and so forth
5182000	5184000	And yeah it's
5184000	5186000	If things slip a month or two it's okay
5186000	5188000	It's sad that
5188000	5190000	Fan fest may or may not happen in November
5190000	5192000	I mean I know that's a ways out we'll see
5192000	5194000	Where the state of the world is at that point
5194000	5196000	But it's
5196000	5198000	Really okay I understand there's other
5198000	5200000	Priorities right now and there's
5200000	5202000	Plenty of things to do in Final Fantasy 14
5202000	5204000	And you know what if I get burned out on it
5204000	5206000	I've got like a backlog a mile high
5206000	5208000	Of other games I need to be catching upon anyway
5208000	5210000	So it's fine so anyhow
5210000	5212000	I thought that was a very nice letter for them to write
5212000	5214000	They really don't owe us that
5214000	5216000	I thought it was very nice that they did
5216000	5218000	But they didn't have to
5218000	5220000	Alright let's move on Dark Soccer are you back?
5222000	5224000	Okay I know she went ahead
5224000	5226000	That's okay would you like to go ahead and do the next story
5226000	5228000	Or want me to come back to you
5228000	5230000	I can do the next story
5230000	5232000	Anyway
5232000	5234000	You know we've kind of
5234000	5236000	Gotten off especially with all the
5236000	5238000	COVID news and everything
5238000	5240000	About the protests in Hong Kong
5240000	5242000	And the free Hong Kong protests
5242000	5244000	So
5244000	5246000	Of all places for the protests
5246000	5248000	To find a new home in
5248000	5250000	It's an animal crossing
5250000	5252000	So since people
5252000	5254000	Can't go to the street
5254000	5256000	Protesting in force
5256000	5258000	Is not physically safe
5258000	5260000	People are going into
5260000	5262000	An unregulated
5262000	5264000	Area to do so
5264000	5266000	And that is animal crossing
5266000	5268000	So they are putting up
5268000	5270000	You know signs
5270000	5272000	You can do your patterns
5272000	5274000	And you can actually do nice big patterns
5274000	5276000	That you can lay out
5276000	5278000	Like as big mats on the ground
5278000	5280000	Like people normally do pads
5280000	5282000	Some people have signs
5282000	5284000	In their houses
5284000	5286000	Their characters are wearing
5286000	5288000	Gas masks and privacy masks
5288000	5290000	And doctors masks
5290000	5292000	And whatever things that can
5292000	5294000	Hide their face
5294000	5296000	As a version
5296000	5298000	Of what they're going to be doing in real life
5298000	5300000	And putting the information out there
5300000	5302000	And reposting it to Twitter
5302000	5304000	Or wherever they need to
5304000	5306000	Having pictures
5306000	5308000	Of
5308000	5310000	You know of people
5310000	5312000	They've lost in the struggle
5312000	5314000	People who are important to
5314000	5316000	The protest
5316000	5318000	And since you know
5318000	5320000	They're wanting to
5320000	5322000	And actually this is a quote
5322000	5324000	That one of the students involved in this
5324000	5326000	Was saying that animal crossing is a good way
5326000	5328000	For us to remind people
5328000	5330000	Not to forget what happened in the past
5330000	5332000	Eight months
5332000	5334000	Not everyone is open to political stuff
5334000	5336000	Animal crossing is a good way to promote our mission
5336000	5338000	To those who are politically apathetic
5338000	5340000	So
5340000	5342000	Keep going
5342000	5344000	You know do it where you can
5344000	5346000	I think it's beautiful
5346000	5348000	Now I believe there was
5348000	5350000	A follow up or something
5350000	5352000	Animal crossing I believe has been banned
5352000	5354000	And I think
5354000	5356000	This stuff might
5356000	5358000	Have something to do with it
5358000	5360000	Obviously they're neither confirming nor denying
5360000	5362000	But one can draw a pretty substantial
5362000	5364000	Conclusion from what
5364000	5366000	History has shown us in this situation
5366000	5368000	So yeah
5368000	5370000	Questbuster says just a week or so ago
5370000	5372000	There was news about how animal crossing had a big
5372000	5374000	Launch in China and people started using it
5374000	5376000	To recreate scenes including COVID
5376000	5378000	Checkpoints and now just recently
5378000	5380000	Animal crossing was pulled
5380000	5382000	I hope all these people have physical copies
5382000	5384000	Yeah well it's
5384000	5386000	Isn't that interesting because
5386000	5388000	You can't really pull it now that it's out there
5388000	5390000	I mean you can stop it from being sold again
5390000	5392000	But as you all know that just drives
5392000	5394000	Demand the product up even higher
5394000	5396000	Take your system offline
5396000	5398000	So it can't pull a
5398000	5400000	PT
5400000	5402000	I realize China is a very different society
5402000	5404000	And they have different ways of doing things
5404000	5406000	But I still feel like
5406000	5408000	Once it's out there
5408000	5410000	People are going to find a way
5410000	5412000	They will
5412000	5414000	Well let's move on we have a few more stories for you guys
5414000	5416000	Before we get to the classic game of the week
5416000	5418000	Loki
5420000	5422000	Let's see so
5422000	5424000	Let's talk a little bit about
5424000	5426000	Stadia
5426000	5428000	So Stadia of course you may know
5428000	5430000	Or are going to be hearing
5430000	5432000	That Stadia Pro has gone free
5432000	5434000	For two months so I'm assuming that
5434000	5436000	With the whole everybody having to be home
5436000	5438000	The whole COVID-19 stuff
5438000	5440000	So they said
5440000	5442000	Google basically said in their blog
5442000	5444000	Hey video games can be a valuable way to socialize
5444000	5446000	With friends and family when you're stuck at home
5446000	5448000	So we're giving gamers in 14 countries
5448000	5450000	Free access to Stadia for two months
5450000	5452000	That's from Phil Harrison
5452000	5454000	And so basically with that
5454000	5456000	You can access
5456000	5458000	Stadia Pro
5458000	5460000	You don't necessarily
5460000	5462000	Need a Stadia controller or
5462000	5464000	Chromecast
5464000	5466000	But you can
5466000	5468000	Use your controllers and stuff like that
5468000	5470000	You do need a Gmail account
5470000	5472000	To be able to participate in that
5472000	5474000	And then of course it comes with some free games as well
5474000	5476000	And they have
5476000	5478000	Of course
5478000	5480000	Destiny and Grit and stuff like that
5480000	5482000	So is this something
5482000	5484000	That you're going to jump back in
5484000	5486000	Since you've already got your free one
5486000	5488000	You know what's funny I wrote some tweets
5488000	5490000	About it because I was like I can't figure out how to
5490000	5492000	Reactivate this because
5492000	5494000	I was on Pro thanks to the friend code
5494000	5496000	Thing because Bobby had given me
5496000	5498000	His friend code and so I had it for three months
5498000	5500000	And then I remembered to cancel it before the 90 days
5500000	5502000	Ran out so that I
5502000	5504000	Didn't get charged for another month because
5504000	5506000	As much as I thought it was fine
5506000	5508000	I never really intended to buy
5508000	5510000	Any more games on the service
5510000	5512000	I was really just playing the free ones
5512000	5514000	That came with Pro
5514000	5516000	So I didn't really
5516000	5518000	See the need to keep it and keep
5518000	5520000	Paying $10 a month for games that
5520000	5522000	I kind of felt like there was more on
5522000	5524000	Something like Xbox Game Pass I wanted to play
5524000	5526000	But I was like alright well if they're giving it away
5526000	5528000	Free for another two months maybe I'll go back and try it again
5528000	5530000	Because I don't dislike Stadia
5530000	5532000	I think from a tech perspective
5532000	5534000	It's actually pretty impressive and I talked about this
5534000	5536000	When I talked about playing the Stadia
5536000	5538000	Before
5538000	5540000	It's like interacting with a YouTube
5540000	5542000	Live
5542000	5544000	And it works pretty darn well and so I think it is
5544000	5546000	A piece of technology worth checking out
5546000	5548000	My only concern is
5548000	5550000	Again I haven't gone in there so I don't know how this one
5550000	5552000	Is set up but is
5552000	5554000	This the gotcha gym membership
5554000	5556000	Thing where they get you to sign up for
5556000	5558000	So many days free and then oh your
5558000	5560000	Credit card is on file which with
5560000	5562000	Google it probably is already
5562000	5564000	On file if you've ever bought anything
5564000	5566000	Through Google they have your credit card
5566000	5568000	Info already if you forget to
5568000	5570000	Cancel are you going to get charged at the end of the 60 days
5570000	5572000	Again I don't know how
5572000	5574000	This one is set up so I don't want to accuse Google
5574000	5576000	Of doing something they're not doing
5576000	5578000	Yes so here's what the way it's
5578000	5580000	Says
5580000	5582000	You're cutting out a little bit Loki
5582000	5584000	It says what?
5584000	5586000	Sorry so it says anybody that
5586000	5588000	Signs up for Google Stadia
5588000	5590000	Will get access to all the games
5590000	5592000	It says if you're
5592000	5594000	Already a Stadia Pro member you won't be charged
5594000	5596000	Next two months
5596000	5598000	After that Stadia Pro is $9.99
5598000	5600000	A month but you can opt out of your subscription
5600000	5602000	Anytime so yes it is
5602000	5604000	The hey sign up
5604000	5606000	Now for free but remember to cancel
5606000	5608000	It before those two months are up otherwise
5608000	5610000	We're going to charge you $9.99
5610000	5612000	I
5612000	5614000	If I'm understanding this that
5614000	5616000	Way then I actually
5616000	5618000	Think this is an incredibly
5618000	5620000	Shitty thing that Google did
5620000	5622000	Because they're using this
5622000	5624000	Situation to get
5624000	5626000	People on their product
5626000	5628000	If I'm understanding it
5628000	5630000	That way that you
5630000	5632000	You have to cancel yourself
5632000	5634000	After 60 days
5634000	5636000	Or gotcha you're going to renew
5636000	5638000	At $9.99 a month
5638000	5640000	Then I kind of think
5640000	5642000	That's really shitty
5642000	5644000	Of Google to use this situation
5644000	5646000	It is what they're doing
5646000	5648000	So
5648000	5650000	The best business as usual
5650000	5652000	For a lot of subscription
5652000	5654000	It is
5654000	5656000	With that being said
5656000	5658000	All I'll say is
5658000	5660000	The technology is
5660000	5662000	Worth it but please
5662000	5664000	If you do decide to do it
5664000	5666000	Immediately set yourself a calendar
5666000	5668000	Reminder at 55 days out
5668000	5670000	To
5670000	5672000	Decide if you really want it or not
5672000	5674000	I will say this
5674000	5676000	Unlike a lot of gyms and that stuff
5676000	5678000	When it comes to gyms you have to call somebody
5678000	5680000	Or cable you have to call somebody
5680000	5682000	And they're going to try to talk you into staying
5682000	5684000	I will give Google credit with this
5684000	5686000	Canceling you just do it online
5686000	5688000	You click a button done
5688000	5690000	So I will say that you don't have to interact with anybody
5690000	5692000	You're not going to get pressured into staying or anything like that
5692000	5694000	But
5694000	5696000	Just be warned
5696000	5698000	Ain't nothing really free
5698000	5700000	In this world I guess
5700000	5702000	Alright
5702000	5704000	Make your own decision on if that's for you
5704000	5706000	Again from the technology perspective
5706000	5708000	I think it is worth checking out
5708000	5710000	But please set yourself a calendar reminder at 55 days
5710000	5712000	To evaluate if you really
5712000	5714000	Want it
5714000	5716000	YYR in chat says
5716000	5718000	Don't be evil slash strike through
5718000	5720000	That part
5720000	5722000	Alright
5722000	5724000	Moving on to how
5724000	5726000	Business is being affected on
5726000	5728000	Different sides of the ocean
5728000	5730000	The ESRB apparently
5730000	5732000	Still going amongst what's going on
5732000	5734000	With the coronavirus and COVID
5734000	5736000	Is that there is no delay right now
5736000	5738000	In assigning game ratings
5738000	5740000	At least that's what they're saying
5740000	5742000	I imagine most of that is still working from home
5742000	5744000	From what I recall of the ESRB
5744000	5746000	I don't think they're actually playing
5746000	5748000	A lot of the games
5748000	5750000	You kind of have to fill out a packet
5750000	5752000	And they kind of assign the rating based on the packet
5752000	5754000	And it's assumed that you did that in good faith
5754000	5756000	Because if they find out you didn't do that in good faith
5756000	5758000	Such as what happened with things like Oblivion
5758000	5760000	And Grand Theft Auto 4
5760000	5762000	With the hot coffee mod and all that stuff
5762000	5764000	That's when things get dicey with the ESRB
5764000	5766000	But they are still going
5766000	5768000	They are still doing ratings and so forth
5768000	5770000	Whereas the CERO
5770000	5772000	Or is it pronounced CERO
5772000	5774000	They are temporarily closed in Japan
5774000	5776000	Due to what's going on in that situation
5776000	5778000	So there are no ratings currently
5778000	5780000	Being assigned right there
5780000	5782000	That could cause a little bit of a backlog
5782000	5784000	It may impact some of the game releases
5784000	5786000	I don't know what's going to come of that there
5786000	5788000	But that is a little bit of a difference
5788000	5790000	Of what's going on over there in that situation
5790000	5792000	I don't know if they're actually playing the games
5792000	5796000	Or what happened in that scenario
5796000	5798000	Alright, well let's go back to a simpler time
5798000	5800000	Dang it, we're going to go back to when
5800000	5802000	The games weren't rated at all
5802000	5804000	Actually I'm not sure the selection is from that period of time
5804000	5806000	But we're still going to go back in time
5806000	5808000	At least ten years
5808000	5810000	And visit a classic game
5810000	5812000	Every week on this show Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault
5812000	5814000	And says, hey, brats
5814000	5818000	Instead of playing these modern newfangled remakes
5818000	5822000	Why don't you go back and play the demakes of yesteryear
5822000	5824000	Dark Sakura
5824000	5826000	This was top notch when it came out
5826000	5828000	It was, this is much more than 8-bit
5828000	5832000	A title from the CD and DVD era
5832000	5834000	Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?
5834000	5838000	This classic game is Project Justice
5838000	5840000	Which, like how have I not done this yet?
5840000	5844000	I mean, I actually had to go check multiple
5844000	5848000	Things to see if I, you know, had even remotely done it
5848000	5850000	So, as it was called in Japan
5850000	5852000	It was Moro Justice Gakuen
5852000	5856000	Which basically burned Justice Academy
5856000	5858000	The, you know, the previous before was
5858000	5860000	She Needs Justice Gakuen
5860000	5862000	Which is private, Justice Academy
5862000	5864000	So, it is a 3D fighting game
5864000	5868000	That came out released from Capcom
5868000	5870000	It's a sequel to Rival Schools and United by Fate
5870000	5874000	And, which was, you know, first released as an arcade game
5874000	5876000	In 2000 and ported to the Dreamcast in 2001
5876000	5880000	And fortunate enough to have been able to play
5880000	5882000	The arcade machine
5882000	5884000	Because they had it at SVGL
5885000	5887000	I do
5887000	5891000	I remember whenever we weren't doing that
5891000	5894000	TBR tournament that was inside there
5894000	5896000	Because I was doing Perfect Attack at that one
5896000	5898000	I was over there playing Project Justice
5898000	5900000	That was the one where Jessica and I
5900000	5902000	Switched out in platform shoes
5904000	5906000	Remember we said we were gonna, we did
5906000	5909000	A Perfect Attack wearing platforms
5909000	5910000	Which was pretty fun
5910000	5912000	I do remember that and I'm stepping away for just a moment, sorry
5913000	5915000	Okay, so at any rate
5915000	5917000	Project Justice is to this day
5917000	5919000	Probably one of my favorite fighting games
5919000	5922000	As far as I love the Rival Schools
5922000	5925000	This one is totally, totally, you know, for me
5925000	5927000	Just really goes there with it
5927000	5930000	So, it is still a team fighter
5930000	5933000	But you have teams of three instead of two
5933000	5935000	So you get extra team up attacks
5935000	5937000	That you can use
5937000	5939000	But another one called a party up
5939000	5943000	So that you would initiate by pressing any three attack buttons together
5943000	5946000	And it is a three person attack
5946000	5951000	That relates to whatever the school
5951000	5953000	Where that character comes from
5953000	5956000	You also have an additional
5956000	5958000	You know, your additional partner
5958000	5961000	Will also let you cancel an opponent's team up special
5961000	5964000	By putting in a team up of their own
5964000	5967000	So you have like a different short fighting sequence
5967000	5969000	Between one character from one team
5969000	5972000	And whoever gets the first hit in
5972000	5975000	Will, you know, be the winner of that one
5975000	5978000	And then it swimmers back to the main fight
5978000	5982000	So you have a bigger meeting
5982000	5985000	Also twelve that's five levels
5985000	5987000	Instead of nine from Rival Schools
5987000	5990000	The party up attack uses all five levels
5990000	5992000	Team up to two
5992000	5996000	Any attempts to cancel
5996000	5998000	Cost one level
5998000	6002000	Also carrying over from the first game
6002000	6005000	Project Justice from Dreamcast in Japan
6005000	6009000	Has a character creation mode that allows you to create your own team fighter
6009000	6012000	It can be used in all the modes except for single player
6012000	6015000	But its package is a board game
6015000	6018000	Which you do during an inter-school festival
6018000	6022000	Instead of the dating of the first Rival Schools
6022000	6025000	You also
6025000	6028000	And actually I have the Japanese version
6028000	6030000	So I got to do this, it was pretty fun
6030000	6034000	And you can also get sub characters
6034000	6037000	That you can unlock through this mode
6037000	6043000	You still have your players that are in the game
6043000	6046000	And a few things that have changed
6047000	6050000	So you've got
6050000	6054000	Like extra, you know, some of the other characters
6054000	6057000	When you have new people to be hinted at
6057000	6061000	Like in the Rival Schools revolution
6061000	6064000	Or I should say, Phoenix Justice
6067000	6069000	Right now I forgot what it was called
6069000	6071000	The Evolution Justice
6071000	6073000	Which I need to put back
6073000	6076000	Basically, things have gone back to normal in this
6076000	6079000	And then there's a group called Reverse Society
6079000	6082000	That comes back in so they have to fight again
6082000	6085000	We have a new character, Kuro Kirishima
6085000	6088000	And Momo
6088000	6090000	I always miss a person
6090000	6093000	Karui Zawa
6093000	6098000	Who is like this pretty violent player person
6098000	6103000	You also have the leader of the Gedo Gang, Daigo
6103000	6107000	Who was peripherally a character in the first game
6107000	6110000	Being mind controlled, so you have mind control
6110000	6114000	And then you also have a Batsu doppelganger called Vatsu
6114000	6118000	So trying to pin it all on Batsu
6118000	6120000	So you've got all kinds of different stuff
6120000	6122000	You have
6122000	6124000	You even have
6124000	6129000	They even go all out with your swimmer character
6129000	6135000	And you can play as the school president and everything
6135000	6137000	It's pretty fun
6137000	6141000	But again, one of my absolute favorite fighting games out there
6141000	6147000	There are people who didn't like it
6147000	6149000	And those people are wrong
6149000	6151000	Famitsu gave it a 33 out of 40
6151000	6155000	A lot of people, it got kind of an average review
6155000	6157000	Higher end of average
6157000	6159000	But you know what?
6159000	6161000	The game is fun
6161000	6163000	That's the important thing about it
6163000	6168000	It's got that goofiness
6168000	6175000	It was friends of mine who did the localization on the first tribal schools
6175000	6183000	And I think that we had just that same heart that went into the original localization
6183000	6187000	They kept a lot of the Japanese dialogue
6187000	6189000	The translation is like
6189000	6193000	It's so funny if you listen to what people say in the game
6193000	6195000	And you know enough to follow the conversation
6195000	6199000	Like, oh, I see what they went there with in this localization
6199000	6201000	That's fully not what they said
6201000	6203000	It's always fun
6203000	6205000	It's fun
6205000	6209000	I cannot state enough how beautiful this game is
6209000	6213000	And we need to make it trend rivals schools 3
6213000	6215000	Make it happen
6215000	6217000	We need to make it happen
6217000	6219000	We need like
6219000	6221000	I'm trying to think where they could go
6221000	6223000	Because we had Chirich Justice Gakuen
6223000	6225000	And then had Moro Justice Gakuen
6225000	6229000	What can they do that's even more than that?
6229000	6231000	Like maybe hot-blooded Justice Gakuen
6231000	6233000	We already have burning
6233000	6235000	We do
6235000	6237000	But anyway
6237000	6239000	The game is great
6239000	6241000	If you haven't played it, sucks to be you, go get it
6241000	6243000	Somehow
6243000	6245000	There it is, the classic game of the week
6245000	6247000	Project Justice
6247000	6251000	Which DarkSakura is amazed that she never picked before
6251000	6253000	But there's always more hidden gems to be found
6253000	6255000	Like how could I have not
6255000	6257000	Questbuster in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says
6257000	6261000	I love the days when Capcom could afford to be occasionally crazy with their ideas
6261000	6263000	Hugs copy of Pocket Fighter
6263000	6265000	I mean
6265000	6267000	There's
6267000	6269000	I wish that we would get
6269000	6271000	A 2D Capcom collection
6271000	6273000	So that we can have things like
6273000	6275000	CyberBots and Red Earth
6275000	6277000	I have two copies of CyberBots
6277000	6279000	I have the limited edition and the regular one
6279000	6281000	But
6281000	6283000	I would love to have
6283000	6285000	The not released in America
6285000	6287000	Fighting game pack
6287000	6289000	Oh yeah
6289000	6291000	There was just recently that Kunio-kun collection
6291000	6293000	With all these NES games
6293000	6295000	That were never released here
6295000	6297000	And then of course
6297000	6299000	Secret of Mana 3
6299000	6301000	Or Trials of Mana if you will
6301000	6303000	Finally broke that barrier
6303000	6305000	And the remake
6305000	6307000	Or remaster whatever you want to call it
6307000	6309000	Is on its way out pretty soon too
6309000	6311000	So it's almost like all these old things that never came out
6311000	6313000	Are finally new again
6313000	6317000	Is Nintendo listening?
6317000	6319000	Mother 3? Hello?
6319000	6321000	You know I actually bought
6321000	6323000	A repro cart that had been translated
6323000	6325000	Just to sit down and play it
6325000	6327000	Mother 3
6327000	6329000	If you want to borrow it you're welcome to
6329000	6331000	Did you see the Animal Crossing level?
6331000	6333000	That opted all the
6333000	6335000	Stuff from the Mother series
6335000	6337000	It looked really cool
6337000	6339000	It was really well done
6339000	6341000	Google it
6341000	6343000	It'll be out there somewhere
6343000	6345000	Did you hear what I read from Orange Wright?
6345000	6347000	The Not Street Fighter Anniversary collection
6347000	6349000	Oh yeah for sure
6349000	6351000	I'd love to see something like that
6351000	6353000	Just before we went on air tonight
6353000	6355000	I don't think it's coming up later in the show
6355000	6357000	Capcom I think said
6357000	6359000	They're looking at a rumor is
6359000	6361000	I think it's a rumor that's why I didn't really put it there
6361000	6363000	That Resident Evil 4 remake is coming up next
6363000	6365000	Even though
6365000	6367000	Who would surprise no one?
6367000	6369000	That one is so good I don't know if they should remake it
6369000	6371000	Whatever they're going to
6371000	6373000	Because the other two have done very well in sales
6373000	6375000	But there is a part of me that's like
6375000	6377000	Why don't you explore some other things
6377000	6379000	Some other games that you have
6379000	6381000	Well Dan and I were talking about this earlier
6381000	6383000	And if they're going to redo one
6383000	6385000	You know what?
6385000	6387000	I want Code Veronica
6387000	6389000	That's what a lot of people are saying
6389000	6391000	It's funny you say that because that actually is like
6391000	6393000	What comes the next breath
6393000	6395000	What a lot of people are saying when people are talking about
6395000	6397000	The Resident Evil 4
6397000	6399000	Code Veronica next
6399000	6401000	Yeah Thar66 in our chat right there
6401000	6403000	I would have preferred Code Veronica
6403000	6405000	Yeah a lot a lot of people out there saying that
6405000	6407000	So we'll see we'll see what happens from Capcom
6407000	6409000	Because I don't believe they've officially announced anything yet
6409000	6411000	Alright well there you go
6411000	6413000	Code Veronica though was to me pinnacle
6413000	6415000	So just saying
6415000	6417000	There it is the classic game of the week
6417000	6419000	Let's do some rapid fire news
6419000	6421000	Loki we'll start with you
6421000	6423000	So the updates for No Man's Sky
6423000	6425000	Just keep on coming
6425000	6427000	We've got pretty cool stuff
6427000	6429000	In the giant mechs
6429000	6431000	You get to pilot so the exomech
6431000	6433000	Is part of
6433000	6435000	Update 2.4
6435000	6437000	And allows you to pilot these mechs
6437000	6439000	And of course they are immune to planetary
6439000	6441000	Hazard and they
6441000	6443000	Have a pretty awesome cockpit as well
6443000	6445000	And look pretty awesome in fact I
6445000	6447000	Decided to make the picture of the mech
6447000	6449000	That they posted on Twitter
6449000	6451000	My background for my work here
6451000	6453000	Looks pretty awesome it's almost like a little bit
6453000	6455000	No Man's Sky-ish but of course much slower
6455000	6457000	Not as fast
6457000	6459000	But
6459000	6461000	I really do need to go play this game
6461000	6463000	Maybe I'll install it on my hard dress
6465000	6467000	But yeah so
6467000	6469000	Check it out it's free if you own the game
6469000	6471000	Yet another thing to go check out
6471000	6473000	Exactly
6473000	6475000	Well if you're looking for some
6475000	6477000	More pre-games to play during
6477000	6479000	This whole COVID-19
6479000	6481000	Situation then
6481000	6483000	You'll be lucky to know that
6483000	6485000	Just Cause 4 is going to be
6485000	6487000	Among the free games that are on
6487000	6489000	This coming week on the Epic Games
6489000	6491000	Store and that's pretty awesome because I
6491000	6493000	Did skip this game which I think I did
6493000	6495000	And maybe I have it in my catalog
6495000	6497000	I don't remember
6497000	6499000	And so
6499000	6501000	Yeah it'll be nice
6501000	6503000	To have this and actually be able to
6503000	6505000	Now I'm second guessing
6505000	6507000	Myself maybe I did buy this on PlayStation
6507000	6509000	4 and I just completely forgot about it
6509000	6511000	Maybe the first time that I've gotten the game
6511000	6513000	And completely forgotten about it
6513000	6515000	But anyways along with that
6515000	6517000	There's going to be some other games
6517000	6519000	Including a visual novel
6519000	6521000	Of Aurelia
6521000	6523000	That's also going to be coming
6523000	6525000	Free as well and then if you act now
6525000	6527000	Sherlock Holmes Crime and Punishments
6527000	6529000	And Close to the Sun are free
6529000	6531000	But those are only going to be free
6531000	6533000	Until Tuesday when these
6533000	6535000	New games will come up and we'll be free then
6535000	6537000	I get those annoying
6537000	6539000	Little messages in the system tray that remind me
6539000	6541000	To download those free games so that's
6541000	6543000	Kind of nice I guess
6543000	6545000	Yes so definitely do that
6545000	6547000	Just because I should
6547000	6549000	Probably convince my son to download it
6549000	6551000	Because he'd have fun playing that game
6551000	6553000	Alright well let's
6553000	6555000	Move on to some other stories
6555000	6557000	This one has to do with Discord and a new
6557000	6559000	Beta feature that's happening in Discord
6559000	6561000	Called the Background Noise Reducer
6561000	6563000	You may have seen this in your own Discord
6563000	6565000	It just showed up there for me in the bottom left
6565000	6567000	So it is a noise suppression
6567000	6569000	Beta feature
6569000	6571000	It's only on the desktop version of the app though not the mobile version
6571000	6573000	And it is supposed to reduce
6573000	6575000	And remove background sounds so voice
6575000	6577000	And video chat folks only hear you
6577000	6579000	Speaking and you shouldn't hear that clack clack
6579000	6581000	Clack clack of a keyboard or the
6581000	6583000	Kids in the background or the pots and pans
6583000	6585000	Clanging or whatever it is going on
6585000	6587000	The technology is from a company called
6587000	6589000	Crisp and it is running locally
6589000	6591000	It is not sharing data with anybody else
6591000	6593000	Development is still early on and they are
6593000	6595000	Working on a phone version of it
6595000	6597000	So that's cool
6597000	6599000	A lot of other meeting software could use something like that
6599000	6601000	That's for sure
6601000	6603000	I'm really excited about this other feature here
6603000	6605000	That Twitch is looking at doing or is actually
6605000	6607000	Rolled out to partners
6607000	6609000	It's called Prime Watch Parties
6609000	6611000	So it's kind of like that Netflix Party idea
6611000	6613000	Except you're kind of leveraging Twitch
6613000	6615000	And you have to have
6615000	6617000	A Twitch Prime or excuse me
6617000	6619000	A Amazon Prime to really like
6619000	6621000	If you don't have an Amazon Prime subscription
6621000	6623000	You don't see the webcam or whatever of the person watching
6623000	6625000	But if you have both
6625000	6627000	You get the webcam of the person watching in the corner
6627000	6629000	And then you actually get like the
6629000	6631000	Amazon Prime show whatever they're watching
6631000	6633000	Timed up to where they're at
6633000	6635000	In the main screen so you actually get both at the same time
6635000	6637000	So it's kind of like an interactive watch party
6637000	6639000	They've actually been kind of
6639000	6641000	Playing with this feature since October last year
6641000	6643000	But now all partners have available
6643000	6645000	Have the access to be able to use this
6645000	6647000	I was looking at one earlier today
6647000	6649000	And my instant reaction was like
6649000	6651000	I want to do this at VOG
6651000	6653000	I want to get some of the
6653000	6655000	Star Trek, Starboard power coupling people together
6655000	6657000	And watch episodes of Star Trek
6657000	6659000	Wouldn't that be great?
6659000	6661000	Except it's not out for affiliates yet
6661000	6663000	And I'm not sure
6663000	6665000	It's a little weird because you have to link
6665000	6667000	Your Amazon Prime account
6667000	6669000	To your Twitch
6669000	6671000	And since VOG Network
6671000	6673000	This account isn't really a person
6673000	6675000	I'm not sure we're going to be able to really do that
6675000	6677000	So it might just have to be something on my personal channel
6677000	6679000	But it's still something that I'm really interested in doing
6679000	6681000	Because I think that's really fun
6681000	6683000	And especially in this day and age
6683000	6685000	That's the type of stuff we could really use
6685000	6687000	So yeah
6687000	6689000	I think it's a really cool idea
6689000	6691000	It kind of takes that Netflix party
6691000	6693000	To the next level
6693000	6695000	Because Netflix
6695000	6697000	That used to be a thing on Xbox 360
6697000	6699000	Then they kind of shot it down
6699000	6701000	And then there's an unofficial
6701000	6703000	Google Chrome add-on
6703000	6705000	That kind of does the same thing
6705000	6707000	That hasn't been shut down yet
6707000	6709000	So I don't know
6709000	6711000	S2100matt in chat says
6711000	6713000	First name VOG, last name Network
6713000	6715000	Middle name Smush
6715000	6717000	You never know
6717000	6719000	I don't want to break the rules
6719000	6721000	We're professionals here most of the time
6721000	6723000	So I mean if I can just use
6723000	6725000	My personal account on VOG's thing
6725000	6727000	Then I would do it but I don't want to break the rules
6727000	6729000	So as long as everything is
6729000	6731000	By the rules then we'll figure out a way
6731000	6733000	But if I have to do it on my personal channel then I will
6733000	6735000	DarkSakura, how about you?
6735000	6737000	Well
6737000	6739000	We have an update
6739000	6741000	About Adi
6741000	6743000	Everybody's Animal Crossing
6743000	6745000	Grandmother
6745000	6747000	The one who logged 3500
6747000	6749000	Hours playing
6749000	6751000	On New Leaf
6751000	6753000	Well the internet got together
6753000	6755000	All of her fans out there
6755000	6757000	And had
6757000	6759000	A crowd funding
6759000	6761000	To buy her
6761000	6763000	The limited edition Animal Crossing
6763000	6765000	Switch
6765000	6767000	Which I watched the unboxing
6767000	6769000	It was adorable
6769000	6771000	She's like I don't know how to do the button
6771000	6773000	You know
6773000	6775000	I want to say
6775000	6777000	Is this her grandson helping her
6777000	6779000	Create her character and everything
6779000	6781000	But we need to see
6781000	6783000	If Adi actually gets Adi
6783000	6785000	In her town which would be great
6785000	6787000	As we know
6787000	6789000	Nintendo of America
6789000	6791000	So
6791000	6793000	We'll see
6793000	6795000	I just think it's an absolutely sweet
6795000	6797000	She just looked tickled to bits
6797000	6799000	And really amused by the whole thing
6799000	6801000	And then
6801000	6803000	In other news
6803000	6805000	Regarding Streets of Rage 4
6805000	6807000	It is coming quote soon
6807000	6809000	With classic characters
6809000	6811000	And with soundtracks
6811000	6813000	There was a tweet
6813000	6815000	By Lizardcube
6815000	6817000	That confirmed the existence
6817000	6819000	Of classic characters and the original soundtracks
6819000	6821000	And also
6821000	6823000	Bringing back returning
6823000	6825000	Characters like Max Gate
6825000	6827000	And Dr. Zahn
6827000	6829000	Are playable in their 16-bit forms
6829000	6831000	With a price of $24.99
6831000	6833000	Confirmed
6833000	6835000	But it does not confirm the April 23
6835000	6837000	Release date
6837000	6839000	And only that it is coming out soon
6839000	6841000	However there was an Australian
6841000	6843000	Nintendo eShop
6843000	6845000	Listing
6845000	6847000	That stated that it would have
6847000	6849000	A storefront release on April 23
6849000	6851000	With a price of around $38
6851000	6853000	Australian dollars
6853000	6855000	Which is roughly $25 US
6855000	6857000	Listing says 12 unique
6857000	6859000	Stages and the ability to unlock
6859000	6861000	And play as classic characters
6861000	6863000	An option to switch out the new
6863000	6865000	Soundtrack with the
6865000	6867000	Original Streets of Rage games
6867000	6869000	And so
6869000	6871000	Hey there we go
6871000	6873000	Alright sounds
6873000	6875000	Good I'm excited to hear that new

6881000	6883000	Let's travel around the world and check out the release
6883000	6885000	Dates for this week although I have a feeling
6885000	6887000	There might not be a lot but we'll check
6887000	6889000	In anyway and
6889000	6891000	Check out the releases so

6905000	6907000	And
6907000	6909000	Pretty much it
6909000	6911000	I was just gonna see
6911000	6913000	If there's any other digital games
6913000	6915000	Since this list doesn't have a lot of digital games
6915000	6917000	So I'm gonna read some of the weird named titles
6917000	6919000	That are on this list like for example
6919000	6921000	We've got a game
6921000	6923000	Called Save
6923000	6925000	Your Nuts on Xbox One and
6925000	6927000	Switch. The Double Dragon

6929000	6931000	PlayStation 4 and Switch so we have Double Dragon
6931000	6933000	On PS4 and
6933000	6935000	Double Dragon 3 on PS4

6941000	6945000	Lots of like digital games coming out this week
6945000	6947000	So yeah where is there may not be a lot of
6947000	6949000	Games coming out
6949000	6951000	There's definitely
6951000	6953000	Games you can check out like Super Forklift
6953000	6955000	3000 on PC
6955000	6957000	Alright nice
6957000	6959000	Alright let's travel over to Japan
6959000	6961000	And check out the release dates in Japan this week
6961000	6963000	Although I'm not seeing an awful lot
6963000	6965000	Happening let's see
6965000	6967000	On the 17th on the Nintendo Switch
6967000	6969000	There's a Guacamelee
6969000	6971000	Collection coming out that's I think the
6971000	6973000	Only thing I really see there
6973000	6975000	Looking on the PlayStation 4
6975000	6977000	Do we have anything different there? No that's
6977000	6979000	That's it it's a very quiet
6979000	6981000	Week in Japan this week but
6981000	6983000	Considering everything that's going on I'm kinda not surprised
6983000	6985000	How about the UK Dark Soccer
6986000	6988000	Crickets chirp chirp
6988000	6990000	Nothing until the 22nd
6990000	6992000	Yeah with all that's going on I'm not too
6992000	6994000	Surprised about that alright
6994000	6996000	We're gonna do things a little bit out of order because
6996000	6998000	I know Dark Soccer has to cut out soon here
6998000	7000000	So I'm gonna shake up what you see on the
7000000	7002000	Sidebar a little bit so Dark Soccer do you wanna take your
7002000	7004000	Next story here which is actually at the bottom
7004000	7006000	Of the list there for those watching
7006000	7008000	On Twitch for those on the podcast feed you have no idea what I'm talking about
7008000	7010000	We actually show the upcoming headlines
7010000	7012000	So we're gonna do this one down here at the bottom
7012000	7014000	Before Dark Soccer says goodnight
7014000	7016000	This one's a doozy so
7016000	7018000	It is a very very
7018000	7020000	Write up by
7020000	7022000	CNET and I'm more than happy
7022000	7024000	To share this with people but I'm gonna give you the
7024000	7026000	Cliff notes on it just because it is
7026000	7028000	Absolutely worth mentioning
7028000	7030000	So they're talking
7030000	7032000	About the upcoming
7032000	7034000	Systems in the climate crisis
7034000	7036000	That our next generation
7036000	7038000	Consoles could be worse for the
7038000	7040000	Environment
7040000	7042000	And
7042000	7044000	There's actually a
7044000	7046000	Game studio called Wildworks where
7046000	7048000	Their CEO Clark Stacey
7048000	7050000	Is quoted saying I don't think it
7050000	7052000	Occurred to many people in the games industry to ask
7052000	7054000	What sort of climate impact came directly
7054000	7056000	From making and playing
7056000	7058000	Games
7058000	7060000	But they're looking at
7060000	7062000	Things like the
7062000	7064000	Output of these
7064000	7066000	Systems and what they're releasing
7066000	7068000	In just carbon dioxide
7068000	7070000	For example the PS4
7071000	7073000	Said that
7073000	7075000	Basically if you have
7075000	7077000	100 million PlayStation 4 units sold
7077000	7079000	Since 2013
7079000	7081000	Generated approximately
7081000	7083000	9.8 million tons of carbon dioxide
7083000	7085000	Which would put it at
7085000	7087000	108th place for
7087000	7089000	Emissions in 2016
7089000	7091000	It would outrank Costa Rica
7091000	7093000	It would outrank the entire country
7093000	7095000	And then
7095000	7097000	In energy usage that number
7097000	7099000	Would double
7099000	7101000	And then
7101000	7103000	Xbox one
7103000	7105000	They have a slightly
7105000	7107000	Smaller
7107000	7109000	But a single
7109000	7111000	Xbox unit emits
7111000	7113000	1.23 tons of carbon dioxide
7113000	7115000	Over an eight year life cycle
7115000	7117000	And so
7117000	7119000	It is a lot more friendly
7119000	7121000	Than say the PS4 for its release
7121000	7123000	But it would still be 0.76 tons
7123000	7125000	And
7125000	7127000	If you were using a less conservative
7127000	7129000	Estimate
7129000	7131000	That
7131000	7133000	The general output from these systems
7133000	7135000	Would be something along the lines
7135000	7137000	Of taking between 40 and 95
7137000	7139000	Million flights from New York
7139000	7141000	To Los Angeles
7141000	7143000	So
7143000	7145000	Pretty intense
7145000	7147000	So the video games industry
7147000	7149000	Please Sony
7149000	7151000	And Microsoft
7151000	7153000	Have been challenged
7153000	7155000	To do
7155000	7157000	To do better
7157000	7159000	And so
7159000	7161000	Actually
7161000	7163000	For
7163000	7165000	The average PCs
7165000	7167000	And current generation of consoles
7167000	7169000	They account for 2.4%
7169000	7171000	Of residential electricity expenditures
7171000	7173000	In the US
7173000	7175000	And have a carbon emission release
7175000	7177000	Of 24 million tons
7177000	7179000	Which is about the same as Sri Lanka
7179000	7181000	In 2017
7181000	7183000	So a whole country
7183000	7185000	The devices associated with it
7185000	7187000	Like the TVs
7187000	7189000	Were responsible for 66%
7189000	7191000	Of home energy use
7191000	7193000	From gaming in 2016
7193000	7195000	So going back to what I was saying
7195000	7197000	The Microsoft and Sony
7197000	7199000	Have been
7199000	7201000	Definitely challenged
7201000	7203000	There was a
7203000	7205000	A conference
7205000	7207000	I'm trying to get the name again
7207000	7209000	Because like I said this is a big article
7209000	7211000	But they were challenged
7211000	7213000	By
7213000	7215000	In the UN's Playing for Planet
7215000	7217000	Alliance to create
7217000	7219000	825,000
7219000	7221000	Carbon neutral
7221000	7223000	Xbox One X consoles
7223000	7225000	Which would be under 2%
7225000	7227000	Of all consoles made
7227000	7229000	But every little bit helps
7229000	7231000	But they're trying
7231000	7233000	They're also wanting to
7233000	7235000	Make them
7235000	7237000	More carbon neutral by buying
7237000	7239000	High quality carbon offsets
7240000	7242000	Sony announced on March 18th
7242000	7244000	Mark Cerny who's the lead systems architect
7244000	7246000	On the PS5
7246000	7248000	Did not make
7248000	7250000	A single mention
7250000	7252000	Of energy draw or the environmental
7252000	7254000	Impact
7254000	7256000	The only thing we have about this
7256000	7258000	Comes from Jim Ryan
7258000	7260000	The present CEO of Sony
7260000	7262000	Interactive Entertainment
7262000	7264000	Who said that they would be able to
7264000	7266000	Suspend gameplay with much
7266000	7268000	Lower power consumption
7268000	7270000	And that if 1 million users
7270000	7272000	Enable this feature it would save the equivalent
7272000	7274000	To average electricity use
7274000	7276000	Of 1,000 US homes
7276000	7278000	And
7278000	7280000	Nintendo however
7280000	7282000	They
7282000	7284000	I mean Switch uses a
7284000	7286000	Bunch less energy than the other systems
7286000	7288000	Lower processing power
7288000	7290000	And graphic fidelity for one thing
7290000	7292000	Results
7292000	7294000	In less energy
7294000	7296000	Consumption
7296000	7298000	They're focused on
7298000	7300000	Better games
7300000	7302000	Even if they don't have that
7302000	7304000	Hardware
7304000	7306000	The size of those things
7306000	7308000	They practically run off a rechargeable battery
7308000	7310000	So it's kind of inherently built in
7310000	7312000	And even a solid three hours
7312000	7314000	Of playing using the handheld mode
7314000	7316000	It does not get hot
7316000	7318000	And that's kind of one thing
7318000	7320000	I was curious about is that
7320000	7322000	I don't know if it's going to be realistic to say
7322000	7324000	Oh we shouldn't have Playstation 5
7324000	7326000	Or Xbox Series X
7326000	7328000	Maybe there's better things they could do in the manufacturing
7328000	7330000	Process like you kind of brought up there with some of the
7330000	7332000	Carbon free consoles
7332000	7334000	But I wonder if there aren't maybe small measures
7334000	7336000	We can take on the consumer side
7336000	7338000	And you kind of brought one up there that maybe
7338000	7340000	There's a thing you can enable there to use
7340000	7342000	The lower power consumption in the background
7342000	7344000	Maybe our consoles don't
7344000	7346000	Necessarily have to be always on
7346000	7348000	I know it's very convenient to have
7348000	7350000	The patch downloads and things like that
7350000	7352000	I know my Xbox One started making weird noises
7352000	7354000	So I kind of like
7354000	7356000	I unplug it completely when I'm not using it
7356000	7358000	And then I'll plug it in
7358000	7360000	An hour before I plan on using it
7360000	7362000	To do any patch downloads and things like that
7362000	7364000	But maybe that's a thing
7364000	7366000	I don't know
7366000	7368000	I'm not saying everybody has to do it my way
7368000	7370000	But maybe there's things consumers can do
7370000	7372000	To cut back on some of that energy usage
7372000	7374000	There's a little bit more
7374000	7376000	There is
7376000	7378000	Clark Stacey again, the head of WildWorks
7378000	7380000	Has
7380000	7382000	Called out a few different things
7382000	7384000	For example, I'm going a little bit more
7384000	7386000	Into cloud
7386000	7388000	Networking for data
7388000	7390000	Saves for games for all that
7390000	7392000	Type of thing
7392000	7394000	And the fact that the data centers require a huge amount
7394000	7396000	Of energy pooling systems
7396000	7398000	That make it run 24 hours a day
7398000	7400000	Forever
7400000	7402000	And actually this is a different quote by Adele Tousie
7402000	7404000	Who's a data engineer at Monash University
7404000	7406000	A typical cloud data center consumes as much energy
7406000	7408000	As 25,000 households
7408000	7410000	And Clark Stacey
7410000	7412000	Who I mentioned earlier goes on to say
7412000	7414000	That Google and Apple are leading the way
7414000	7416000	Basically saying that since the data centers
7416000	7418000	Are 100% powered by renewable energy
7418000	7420000	Then
7420000	7422000	This actually requires
7422000	7424000	The companies that use renewable energy
7424000	7426000	To invest in renewable energy
7426000	7428000	For the open market
7428000	7430000	Ubisoft
7430000	7432000	Has gone 99%
7432000	7434000	Which has
7434000	7436000	Basically
7436000	7438000	Had them to release
7438000	7440000	Far less
7440000	7442000	Carbon dioxide
7442000	7444000	Into the atmosphere
7444000	7446000	But the thing is
7446000	7448000	That a lot of these other groups
7448000	7450000	Are using
7450000	7452000	Cloud-based services
7452000	7454000	Or even their own
7454000	7456000	I'm trying to think of
7456000	7458000	Just general
7458000	7460000	Operations
7460000	7462000	If they could
7462000	7464000	Lower that impact
7464000	7466000	That's how data centers
7466000	7468000	Make up
7468000	7470000	They actually could make up
7470000	7472000	Approximately 60% of all energy uses
7472000	7474000	In communication by 2025
7474000	7476000	So
7476000	7478000	We really need to be pushing them
7478000	7480000	Into
7480000	7482000	Using
7482000	7484000	Cleaner energy
7484000	7486000	Into
7486000	7488000	Finding renewable resources
7488000	7490000	And this has to start top down
7490000	7492000	But the thing is
7492000	7494000	They're not really having
7494000	7496000	The ability
7496000	7498000	For
7498000	7500000	Climate change
7500000	7502000	Based on
7502000	7504000	Their current operation status
7504000	7506000	They're not really having too much
7506000	7508000	Of an incentive
7508000	7510000	Other than
7510000	7512000	The public
7512000	7514000	Poking back at them
7514000	7516000	But
7516000	7518000	If they
7518000	7520000	We also need companies
7520000	7522000	Take to
7522000	7524000	EA
7524000	7526000	They haven't put any
7526000	7528000	Type of
7528000	7530000	Report on their emissions
7530000	7532000	Or their energy usage
7532000	7534000	And
7534000	7536000	Microsoft when their spokespeople did
7536000	7538000	Submit a disability
7538000	7540000	Sony and Nintendo did not
7540000	7542000	Respond to a request for comment
7542000	7544000	But
7544000	7546000	And of course we have all of our
7546000	7548000	Handhelds too
7548000	7550000	And some of the big companies
7550000	7552000	Are innovating and jumping the gun
7552000	7554000	On getting the
7554000	7556000	Emissions reduced
7556000	7558000	And making things with more
7558000	7560000	Renewable
7560000	7562000	I think now a lot of
7562000	7564000	Computers and
7564000	7566000	Handheld devices
7566000	7568000	Made from recycled material
7568000	7570000	So that's good but we need
7570000	7572000	To hold people's assets to the
7572000	7574000	Fire
7574000	7576000	And I think awareness
7576000	7578000	Is probably a big component of this
7578000	7580000	And one thing that we probably need
7580000	7582000	Our gaming media, our gaming press
7582000	7584000	To do is now that we know
7584000	7586000	Where these things are coming from
7586000	7588000	Cloud gaming is the future but at what
7588000	7590000	Cost as you point out there
7590000	7592000	We need our people that have access
7592000	7594000	To be able to interview these folks
7594000	7596000	To ask these questions. This doesn't have to be done in a
7596000	7598000	Punitive or a negative way but
7598000	7600000	This cloud gaming sounds great but
7600000	7602000	What are you doing to ensure that there's
7602000	7604000	No harm to the planet from it or what are you doing
7604000	7606000	To get back on these. We need these people
7606000	7608000	To ask those because unfortunately
7608000	7610000	We could say here on our little podcast
7610000	7612000	And say those types of things and think about
7612000	7614000	The things that we could do maybe a little more
7614000	7616000	Directly but we're not gonna
7616000	7618000	Realistically be able to really affect the change
7618000	7620000	The way that people that have more direct access
7620000	7622000	Have the ability to do that
7622000	7624000	If that makes sense. Like I was saying it has to start top down
7624000	7626000	You know but
7626000	7628000	You know we can also
7628000	7630000	I'm sorry but I'm really surprised on Microsoft
7630000	7632000	Side of things especially I know Bill Gates
7632000	7634000	Doesn't run it anymore and in fact Bill Gates isn't even
7634000	7636000	Involved with the board anymore but I'm just
7636000	7638000	Surprised with him kind of being the legacy
7638000	7640000	Of Microsoft and everything. Him and his
7640000	7642000	Foundations on the planet. I'm really surprised
7642000	7644000	They're not at the forefront of this
7644000	7646000	Which they ought to be
7646000	7648000	Microsoft has really been
7648000	7650000	I mean they're late to the game in terms of
7652000	7654000	Environmental viability
7654000	7656000	Other companies have really
7656000	7658000	Been doing a lot better than them
7658000	7660000	I mean I think
7660000	7662000	That will and here was what the exam
7662000	7664000	Say and
7664000	7666000	This actually brings our current pandemic
7666000	7668000	Into things. Look at how
7668000	7670000	Much these places
7670000	7672000	Around us have cleaned up
7672000	7674000	Without
7674000	7676000	The level of energy
7676000	7678000	And material and
7678000	7680000	Being put out
7680000	7682000	If we can get companies
7682000	7684000	To do you know
7684000	7686000	To what's the lack of a
7686000	7688000	Better description to
7688000	7690000	To have that same kind of
7690000	7692000	Control to keep things isolated
7692000	7694000	To you know using
7694000	7696000	This renewable resource keep them
7696000	7698000	Using recycled materials
7698000	7700000	To you know put pressure on
7700000	7702000	The government for example
7702000	7704000	To find cleaner ways
7704000	7706000	Of shipping
7706000	7708000	You know games and all of that we can
7708000	7710000	Really really make
7710000	7712000	Such a big impact. You know piggybacking
7712000	7714000	On that a little bit this is this is the hottest of
7714000	7716000	Hot takes but some would say
7716000	7718000	That you know and I don't know if it's right
7718000	7720000	Or wrong take it or leave it but some would say that
7720000	7722000	The pandemic and what's happening
7722000	7724000	Is in this I guess
7724000	7726000	This depends on what you believe in in science over this is
7726000	7728000	This is earth's response
7728000	7730000	To the humans living on it not
7730000	7732000	Responding to climate
7732000	7734000	Change. You know I mean when you see that
7734000	7736000	Direct impact that you know
7736000	7738000	The pandemic kind of isolating people in their homes
7738000	7740000	Or this having on the climate you know
7740000	7742000	Some would say that is the earth healing
7742000	7744000	Itself. At least it's not
7744000	7746000	The happening yeah right
7746000	7748000	So anyway I know that's I know that
7748000	7750000	Is the hottest of takes but it is it's one of those
7750000	7752000	Things that makes you go hmm
7752000	7754000	Yeah and you know what and there's
7754000	7756000	Also this thing going on oh
7756000	7758000	This is you know
7758000	7760000	I don't think it's people that
7760000	7762000	Are the virus I think that
7762000	7764000	Is people's decisions
7764000	7766000	We all have to be
7766000	7768000	Able to
7768000	7770000	And now I'm going to be getting into a bit more broad
7770000	7772000	Outside of video games but we all have to look
7772000	7774000	At what our personal impact is
7774000	7776000	And we have to make good on it
7776000	7778000	You know and I'm not talking about
7778000	7780000	Oh straight
7780000	7782000	Fuck that that whole thing was ableist as fuck
7782000	7784000	But I mean we have to
7784000	7786000	Look at the companies that we are
7786000	7788000	Shopping from and what they are doing
7788000	7790000	And the fact that our money is supporting their bullshit
7790000	7792000	You know
7792000	7794000	We have to we have to find this
7794000	7796000	We have
7796000	7798000	People accountable and we have to
7798000	7800000	You know and speaking
7800000	7802000	Of top down in this country
7802000	7804000	We have to fucking start with top down
7804000	7806000	Alright
7806000	7808000	So things don't shape up
7812000	7814000	Yeah you guys are both cutting in and out
7814000	7816000	I thought it was maybe just my wi-fi
7816000	7818000	And to my phone
7818000	7820000	Okay oh boy alright
7820000	7822000	So what I said is I said if
7822000	7824000	Things don't start shaping up
7824000	7826000	We're going to have to start bombing makeup
7826000	7828000	I think he's making a Final Fantasy 7
7828000	7830000	Remake joke
7830000	7832000	Oh yeah let's go hit Shinra
7832000	7834000	And run the balls
7834000	7836000	I definitely want to read this comment
7836000	7838000	Sorry no Bobby
7838000	7840000	It's not the new noise cancelling
7840000	7842000	Because I specifically said before the show
7842000	7844000	Don't turn that on until we have a chance to play with it
7844000	7846000	It's not the new noise cancelling
7846000	7848000	I didn't even know it existed so I didn't touch it
7848000	7850000	Yeah
7850000	7852000	VG Realness in Chat says
7852000	7854000	I feel like some gaming press is afraid to ask the hard
7854000	7856000	Questions for fear of not getting early releases
7856000	7858000	A big basket of bullshit in this industry
7858000	7860000	I mean it's not even about this climate
7860000	7862000	Change thing which I mean is certainly something
7862000	7864000	But I mean it's a whole thing
7864000	7866000	Where it's like we've known for
7866000	7868000	Some time that you know outlets who
7868000	7870000	Don't ask the hard questions get
7870000	7872000	They get their hands slapped
7872000	7874000	And you know unfortunately
7874000	7876000	As Darkstalk was talking about some things are from the top
7876000	7878000	Down and when you see the same type
7878000	7880000	Of thing happening at the highest of offices
7880000	7882000	In North America
7882000	7884000	Or excuse me in the United States
7884000	7886000	I don't know what to say
7886000	7888000	Anyway
7888000	7890000	I also want to respond to pod culture
7890000	7892000	To Brad
7892000	7894000	Digital only is pretty damn clean
7894000	7896000	But going back to the thing
7896000	7898000	In that CNET article I was going off of
7898000	7900000	Bear in mind that
7900000	7902000	It takes energy for the downloads
7902000	7904000	It takes energy to host
7904000	7906000	The digital copies
7906000	7908000	We're getting back into the cloud services
7908000	7910000	And those cloud services use a ton of energy
7910000	7912000	Unless they are doing a lot more to offset it
7913000	7915000	So even though it might be less physical waste
7915000	7917000	Which certainly would be a thing
7917000	7919000	Again there might still be a trade off
7919000	7921000	For that so anyway
7921000	7923000	And some folks in chat just kind of like breaking news
7923000	7925000	Folks in chat are saying playstation network
7925000	7927000	Is apparently down right now
7927000	7929000	So I wonder if there isn't a whole thing going on with the internet
7929000	7931000	And I thought maybe it was just me
7931000	7933000	Because for those that don't know
7933000	7935000	How things are wired
7935000	7937000	I actually have two accounts
7937000	7939000	On discord so I have one account
7939000	7941000	That strictly is on the wired
7941000	7943000	Connection and it also feeds in
7943000	7945000	My microphone and the mixing board
7945000	7947000	And so it kind of mixes everything with them on discord
7947000	7949000	And then the way I listen to them
7949000	7951000	So that you don't hear the feedback
7951000	7953000	Is I am in on my own personal account
7953000	7955000	On this wifi on my phone
7955000	7957000	That's why I've been wearing headphones
7957000	7959000	Ever since we started doing the
7959000	7961000	Social distance episodes of OLR
7961000	7963000	So I thought maybe my wifi was cutting in
7963000	7965000	And out so I was just kind of
7965000	7967000	Because I was watching the meters and they didn't seem to be dropping
7967000	7969000	But apparently it's a weird internet issue going on
7969000	7971000	So I don't know what's up
7971000	7973000	So sorry guys but we're doing our best
7973000	7975000	Wish we could all be in the same room but it is what it is
7975000	7977000	And as I said I was going to put
7977000	7979000	Because like I said there's a bunch more
7979000	7981000	In this article
7981000	7983000	So I posted it on
7983000	7985000	My own account
7985000	7987000	So
7987000	7989000	If you want to read up on it
7989000	7991000	And look at what you can do
7991000	7993000	Then
7993000	7995000	I'd say give it a look over
7995000	7997000	See what needs to be
7997000	7999000	Done who needs to be talked to
7999000	8001000	And hold their asses to the fire
8001000	8003000	Alright
8003000	8005000	I have spoken
8005000	8007000	Alright well on that note Dark Soccer I know you need to take off
8007000	8009000	So any final thoughts
8009000	8011000	Or last thoughts for our listeners tonight before you take off
8011000	8013000	Send me chocolate
8013000	8015000	Like legit
8015000	8017000	No one guessed my fucking favorite chocolate by the way
8017000	8019000	So it's
8019000	8021000	Vosages
8021000	8023000	It's the stout chocolate
8023000	8025000	I require many bars of this
8025000	8027000	Sent to my house, message me for details
8027000	8029000	And that is very true
8029000	8031000	Because every time I go to Chicago where they have a lot of it
8031000	8033000	That's what I bring back Dark Soccer
8033000	8035000	When she's doing the kitty sitting
8035000	8037000	I can find by the way
8037000	8039000	The bars at the nugget
8039000	8041000	But I cannot get those delicious truffles
8041000	8043000	Yeah those are harder to find
8043000	8045000	Alright
8045000	8047000	And I love you for it, love love love heart heart heart
8047000	8049000	Alright take care Dark Soccer
8049000	8051000	And we'll see you next week
8051000	8053000	Be well, be safe
8053000	8055000	You stupid people stay in your house
8055000	8057000	Alright
8057000	8059000	Let's move on to our mail bag
8059000	8061000	Participate at orangetontrader.com
8061000	8063000	It's the place where you can send us an email every week
8063000	8065000	We got one quick email tonight
8065000	8067000	This is from Robert M
8067000	8069000	Who emailed us to say
8069000	8071000	I haven't heard it discussed but after four years
8071000	8073000	WayForward released their formerly Humble Bundle
8073000	8075000	Subscription exclusive
8075000	8077000	Cat Girl Without Salad
8077000	8079000	On the Switch
8079000	8081000	Appropriately on April 1st
8081000	8083000	They will be getting repeated over multiple plays
8083000	8085000	At the few levels
8085000	8087000	Might not be worth the $9 for everybody
8087000	8089000	But a fun distraction between New Horizons sessions
8089000	8091000	$9 is really really low price though
8091000	8093000	And thank you for the email
8093000	8095000	Appreciate that
8095000	8097000	And just based on the title
8097000	8099000	It sounds like something I want to check out
8099000	8101000	The problem is
8101000	8103000	And for me this is a big problem with the Switch overall
8103000	8105000	It's great that they have a lot of games
8105000	8107000	But their eShop doesn't handle that avalanche of games
8107000	8109000	Very well
8109000	8111000	It's not like
8111000	8113000	Steam
8113000	8115000	Even Steam is starting to buckle under the weight
8115000	8117000	It's not very easy to explore and find things
8117000	8119000	Because I had no idea about this game
8119000	8121000	Until you send an email
8121000	8123000	So I think the best thing you can do
8123000	8125000	When you have a little indie game
8125000	8127000	That you like like this
8127000	8129000	Help spread the word
8129000	8131000	And I say it at the end of every Orange Launch Radio
8131000	8133000	Because it's true for us as an indie podcast
8133000	8135000	We're never going to get the types of views
8135000	8137000	That IGN Podcast
8137000	8139000	GameSpot Podcast
8139000	8141000	Or employees that formerly worked for those organizations
8141000	8143000	Having their own podcast
8143000	8145000	We're not going to have those types of numbers
8145000	8147000	Because we don't have that
8147000	8149000	So the best thing you can do for us
8149000	8151000	Is help us spread the word
8151000	8153000	And the same thing is true of these indie Switch titles
8153000	8155000	Because even though they're on the Switch
8155000	8157000	They don't have Nintendo's name on them
8157000	8159000	So spread the word
8159000	8161000	That's why I like to do that for YYR
8161000	8163000	We have a small audience here at Orange Launch Radio
8163000	8165000	But I like to pimp YYR's games
8165000	8167000	They're pretty good and I think people should see them
8167000	8169000	Especially, especially super multitasking
8169000	8171000	It blows my mind that that game has not gone viral
8171000	8173000	But you know, you gotta spread the word
8173000	8175000	Tell people about the products you love
8175000	8177000	So I will say this Robert M
8177000	8179000	You are doing the right thing
8179000	8181000	When it comes to how to spread the word
8181000	8183000	For finding those games on the marketplace
8183000	8185000	And I will check that out, Catgirl Without Salad
8185000	8189000	Spreading the word by streaming games
8189000	8191000	Is a big one as well
8191000	8197000	Do you want to rob Robert's super hot take, Loki?
8197000	8199000	Do you want a really unpopular super hot take
8199000	8201000	About streaming games?
8201000	8203000	Yeah
8203000	8205000	I think, and this is my opinion
8205000	8207000	And I'm speaking of no other streamer
8207000	8209000	Or no other watcher other than myself
8209000	8215000	I think it is a bad idea to stream Final Fantasy 7 Remake right now
8215000	8217000	Because I don't think narrative video games like that
8217000	8219000	Make for very good streams
8219000	8221000	Because if you drop in and out
8221000	8223000	You're either gonna be spoiling yourself on the story
8223000	8225000	For the game you hope to be playing
8225000	8227000	Or you're gonna be dropping in on something
8227000	8229000	Where you didn't see the whole few hours
8229000	8231000	Leading up to this particular point
8231000	8237000	And I just, there's a reason why I kind of stop streaming those types of games
8237000	8239000	Because I'm not sure it's always like
8239000	8241000	It's not really what I enjoy either
8241000	8243000	I don't necessarily like all the personalities
8243000	8245000	That I do see streaming some of these games
8245000	8247000	Kind of like doing their own voice acting
8247000	8249000	Doing their own voice acting
8249000	8251000	Or doing their own thing on top of this
8251000	8253000	Like I just don't think narrative games like that
8253000	8255000	Make for very good streams
8255000	8257000	On the flip side, I think Animal Crossing
8257000	8259000	And those more like evergreen games
8259000	8261000	That are meant for user created content
8261000	8263000	I think they're great games to stream
8263000	8265000	And I think that's why games like
8265000	8267000	Minecraft and like a lot of things
8267000	8269000	That are very like user, Stardew Valley
8269000	8271000	I think that's why those games have tended
8271000	8273000	To do very well on Twitch in the past
8273000	8275000	Because I think those streams are better
8275000	8277000	They also do a lot of creative things
8277000	8279000	Oddly enough so like
8279000	8281000	My kids watch a ton of Minecraft streams
8281000	8283000	And Roblox stuff and all that
8283000	8285000	I've started to watch more of those now
8285000	8287000	And it's because it's not necessarily
8287000	8289000	That it's just, it's vanilla playing Minecraft
8289000	8293000	They do interesting things with it
8293000	8295000	Like for example, one I watched the other day
8295000	8299000	It was two players trying to speedrun Minecraft
8299000	8301000	While they have a terminator after them
8301000	8303000	And the terminator is basically
8303000	8305000	A AI bot that just hunts them down
8305000	8307000	And while they're playing it
8307000	8309000	And that made it interesting
8309000	8311000	They have a person
8311000	8313000	One person trying to speedrun the game
8313000	8315000	And beat it, the other one has a compass
8315000	8317000	That points to where the other person is
8317000	8319000	And they're trying to stop them
8319000	8321000	From beating the game
8321000	8323000	And so those are fun
8323000	8325000	Or like some of the
8327000	8329000	Ultimate hardcore stuff that they do
8329000	8331000	Or like
8331000	8333000	Deathmatch stuff are pretty fun
8333000	8335000	They can mix it up
8335000	8337000	And of course my hot take
8337000	8339000	Is getting a lot of comments in chat
8339000	8341000	See what happens when you don't send emails
8341000	8343000	That's gonna happen now
8343000	8345000	You're gonna get a Rob Roberts really super hot take
8347000	8349000	Maybe it'll be on Drag Race, maybe not
8349000	8351000	So some comments here
8351000	8353000	That it's generating here
8353000	8355000	Bobby Blackwell says I only stream narrative games
8355000	8357000	If they were on MS-DOS in the 90s
8357000	8359000	And again, I'm not calling any single person out
8359000	8361000	And myself, I was streaming
8361000	8363000	Ni No Kuni 2 when it first came out
8363000	8365000	And then I kind of realized by the time I got to
8365000	8367000	Part 4 or 5
8367000	8369000	If you didn't see Part 1
8369000	8371000	Why would you come watch Parts 4 and 5
8371000	8373000	And that's why
8373000	8375000	When I see the tweets that are like
8375000	8377000	Come watch my Nier
8377000	8379000	Nier Automata was when I was looking for videos
8379000	8381000	Because I love the soundtracks
8381000	8383000	And I would see these videos that come up on the side
8383000	8385000	Watch my Nier Automata Part 23 playthrough
8385000	8387000	And I'm like girl
8387000	8389000	If I didn't watch Part 1
8389000	8391000	I ain't gonna watch Part 23
8393000	8395000	But if all your streaming is Part 1
8395000	8397000	I think that's different
8397000	8399000	And that's what kind of Bobby gets
8399000	8401000	So when you're doing the MS-DOS game in the 90s
8401000	8403000	I feel like you usually do that first
8403000	8405000	And then that's usually it
8405000	8407000	And that's kind of where it gets
8407000	8409000	Those first couple hours types of things
8409000	8411000	Yeah, if I streamed Final Fantasy 7 Remake
8411000	8413000	It would just be the beginning of the game
8413000	8415000	Exactly, that's different
8415000	8417000	That's a good little sample of the game
8417000	8419000	And then you're not getting too far into it
8419000	8421000	But I'm not gonna
8421000	8423000	And this is any streamer I'm following
8423000	8425000	And I love you guys, I love the community and so forth
8425000	8427000	But if you're streaming Final Fantasy 7 Remake right now
8427000	8429000	I'm not gonna visit your channel
8429000	8431000	Because you might be further along than I am
8431000	8433000	And I don't wanna be spoiled
8433000	8435000	It's just as simple as that
8435000	8437000	VGRealness says say their names
8437000	8439000	Everybody
8439000	8441000	Everybody is guilty, I've been guilty of it
8441000	8443000	You've been guilty of it
8443000	8445000	I'm calling out the planet
8451000	8453000	Let's see
8453000	8455000	I'm dragging everybody today
8455000	8457000	Says SSG100Matt
8457000	8459000	Questbuster says
8459000	8461000	I'll watch some classic game streams
8461000	8463000	Where no one says a thing
8463000	8465000	But because I love the gamer I'm really curious about retro
8465000	8467000	I'll stick with it
8467000	8469000	Again, different strokes for different folks
8469000	8471000	Again, I'm not saying you shouldn't watch these streams
8471000	8473000	You should actually, because I don't want to
8473000	8475000	So somebody should be
8475000	8477000	Supporting these streams
8477000	8479000	But I just think
8479000	8481000	It isn't the most compelling content
8481000	8483000	To be streaming narrative games
8483000	8485000	Part 23
8485000	8487000	That's all I'm gonna say
8487000	8489000	Alright
8489000	8491000	BobbyBlackWolf
8491000	8493000	I'm laughing because of the comments in chat
8493000	8495000	BobbyBlackWolf says Rob's being affected by Mako
8495000	8497000	I keep wanting to say Mako, but now we've learned it's Mako
8497000	8499000	Rob's being affected by the Mako
8499000	8501000	The planet is crying out in pain and he's mad
8501000	8503000	Yeah, I'm mad
8503000	8505000	Alright, let's move on
8505000	8507000	Loki, quick, change the subject before I get another
8507000	8509000	hot take out there that gets me in trouble
8509000	8511000	So we should stream this too
8511000	8513000	Because it's going to be pretty fun
8513000	8515000	No, I don't want to get cancelled
8515000	8517000	So the
8517000	8519000	LEGO Super Mario sets
8519000	8521000	They're going to be launching
8521000	8523000	August
8523000	8525000	They of course announced this
8525000	8527000	A few weeks ago
8527000	8529000	So now we have
8529000	8531000	Some pricing and what exactly
8531000	8533000	So I don't think it's
8533000	8535000	Necessarily too expensive
8535000	8537000	But the
8537000	8539000	Starter set, a $60 adventure
8539000	8541000	With Mario's starter course
8541000	8543000	Yeah, $60
8543000	8545000	If you pre-order it, you also get
8545000	8547000	A little
8547000	8549000	It's called Super Mushroom
8549000	8551000	And Monty Mole
8551000	8553000	So it's like a little collector's thing that you can
8553000	8555000	Get as well to add some more stuff
8555000	8557000	To that
8557000	8559000	I'm not sure if you'll be able to
8559000	8561000	I think they've stopped taking pre-orders
8561000	8563000	Because it's already been so popular
8563000	8565000	So there's that
8565000	8567000	And then they showed off some new sets
8569000	8571000	Piranha Plant
8571000	8573000	It looks like a little seesaw thing
8573000	8575000	With two piranha plants on it
8575000	8577000	And that's $30
8577000	8579000	And then of course the Bowser's Castle
8579000	8581000	Boss Battle expansion
8581000	8583000	Which is $100
8583000	8585000	When you're talking about Lego prices
8585000	8587000	That's not too bad
8587000	8589000	Not a lot of pieces though
8589000	8591000	But then again
8591000	8593000	The Mario's
8593000	8595000	The character itself
8595000	8597000	Is very sophisticated with these
8597000	8599000	A voice
8599000	8601000	And everything like that
8601000	8603000	So I can understand how that might be a bit more expensive
8603000	8605000	The Bowser's Castle thing looks pretty awesome though
8605000	8607000	I gotta say
8607000	8609000	Yeah, those Legos
8609000	8611000	As expensive as they are, what else is new with Lego?
8611000	8613000	They look so cool
8613000	8615000	Honestly
8615000	8617000	Sign me up
8617000	8619000	Uncle Sam's sending me $2400
8619000	8621000	Why not blow it on Legos?
8621000	8623000	I'm sorry
8623000	8625000	I should but
8625000	8627000	You know there's lots of people thinking it
8627000	8629000	Like
8629000	8631000	What dumb shit
8631000	8633000	Am I gonna spend that
8633000	8635000	And I shouldn't make a lie because a lot of people really need that
8635000	8637000	For very serious things
8637000	8639000	But there are a lot of other people that are like
8639000	8641000	I should spend that money on Legos
8641000	8643000	Why not?
8643000	8645000	Anyway
8645000	8647000	Pixel pockets in chat says
8647000	8649000	I want the Bowser set
8649000	8651000	Let's see
8651000	8653000	They're talking about the ability to post gifts in the chat
8653000	8655000	And I'm like yes I'm all for that
8655000	8657000	You should be able to post gifts
8657000	8659000	But Loki are you gonna buy the Legos and do some building?
8659000	8661000	Probably
8661000	8663000	Same
8663000	8665000	Big same
8665000	8667000	Let's move on and talk about
8667000	8669000	What's going on in the chat
8669000	8671000	What's going on in the chat
8671000	8673000	What's going on in the chat
8673000	8675000	What's going on in the chat
8675000	8677000	What's going on in the chat
8677000	8679000	What's going on in the chat
8679000	8681000	What's going on in the chat
8681000	8683000	What's going on in the chat
8683000	8685000	What's going on in the chat
8685000	8687000	What's going on in the chat
8687000	8689000	What's going on in the chat
8689000	8691000	What's going on in the chat
8691000	8693000	What's going on in the chat
8693000	8695000	Just wanted to know whether Blizzcon 2020 will be feasible
8695000	8697000	They have a lot of their own employees
8697000	8699000	In fact I think all their employees are working at home right now
8699000	8701000	At Blizzard
8701000	8703000	I mean certainly there's a whole side of event planning there
8703000	8705000	So those folks are still
8705000	8707000	Event planning
8707000	8709000	Because
8709000	8711000	They would rather
8711000	8713000	Plan something and have to cancel it
8713000	8715000	Than not have planned it at all
8715000	8717000	And find out
8717000	8719000	Miraculously we have a cure by the summer
8719000	8721000	I know
8721000	8723000	That's probably not realistic and I shouldn't even say that
8723000	8725000	But you know you always cross your fingers and your toes
8725000	8727000	Maybe something will come through
8727000	8729000	But anyhow Blizzard does acknowledge
8729000	8731000	That it could be several months before they know
8731000	8733000	If they're going to be forced to cancel Blizzcon or not
8733000	8735000	And that's the case with everything in the fall right now
8735000	8737000	Like early on in this process
8737000	8739000	It was definitely like
8739000	8741000	DragonCon, Blizzcon
8741000	8743000	FanFest, all those things that happen in the fall
8743000	8745000	We'll be fine, this will be over by the fall
8745000	8747000	And now the longer that this goes on
8747000	8749000	They talk more about the curve
8749000	8751000	The potential second waves
8751000	8753000	And we don't necessarily have all the answers
8753000	8755000	We don't really know
8755000	8757000	Is it going to be safe for all those nerds
8757000	8759000	Who don't always take a shower
8759000	8761000	To be crammed together
8761000	8763000	In the Anaheim Convention Center
8763000	8765000	That might not be a good idea actually
8765000	8767000	So
8767000	8769000	We don't know yet
8769000	8771000	We just don't know and neither does Blizzard
8771000	8773000	And so we'll have more information on that
8773000	8775000	In the coming months
8775000	8777000	But there is going to come a point
8777000	8779000	Where there is a go or no go
8779000	8781000	Like there is going to come a point where
8781000	8783000	They have to make their decision
8783000	8785000	So we'll see what's talking
8785000	8787000	Do you think they would try to do like a digital only event
8787000	8789000	And money?
8789000	8791000	I'm sure Blizzard would do a digital only event
8791000	8793000	Would they charge money for it?
8793000	8795000	That's a very good question
8795000	8797000	Because Blizzcon
8797000	8799000	Well, but Blizzcon is also all of their
8799000	8801000	Championship games
8801000	8803000	And if they can't really do that
8803000	8805000	I guess they could just do it via distance
8805000	8807000	I'm not sure
8807000	8809000	Like Hearthstone you could probably do that way
8809000	8811000	But I'm not sure you could do things like
8811000	8813000	Heroes of the Storm or Mythic Dungeon
8813000	8815000	That's like 5 people or Overwatch
8815000	8817000	I'm not sure you could do all those as easy
8817000	8819000	So I wouldn't rule it out
8819000	8821000	But yeah
8821000	8823000	It's not necessarily
8823000	8825000	Going to happen either
8825000	8827000	Sia Tabiri in chat says
8827000	8829000	I hope more comedians start doing Zoom shows
8829000	8831000	This is a big thing in the
8831000	8833000	Drag community actually too
8833000	8835000	There's a lot of drag kings
8835000	8837000	I know a lot of drag kings locally
8837000	8839000	That
8839000	8841000	Are doing their own shows on Instagram
8841000	8843000	And actually
8843000	8845000	I don't want to say who it is
8845000	8847000	But I actually follow a drag queen
8847000	8849000	On social media
8849000	8851000	And I actually chatted with them
8851000	8853000	And it's one of the Rugerolls
8853000	8855000	So you know who they are
8855000	8857000	That wants to start doing a Twitch stream
8857000	8859000	And so I was giving them
8859000	8861000	Like I was talking to them about
8861000	8863000	Oh well good news so do I
8863000	8865000	And I was telling them about how to download OBS
8865000	8867000	And all that stuff so we'll see if they actually do it
8867000	8869000	Because I think a lot of people really like
8869000	8871000	The Twitch bits system
8871000	8873000	As being able to donate and tip
8873000	8875000	And some of that stuff on demand
8875000	8877000	So a lot of drag queens are looking at Twitch
8877000	8879000	As the ability to do that
8879000	8881000	And so you know put any artist
8881000	8883000	You might kind of roll your eyes
8883000	8885000	Oh there's Rob talking about drag queens again
8885000	8887000	But where that goes comedians
8887000	8889000	And other types of artists
8889000	8891000	Really follow especially the longer
8891000	8893000	That this goes on
8893000	8895000	That's for sure
8895000	8897000	Yeah VGRealnessInChat says
8897000	8899000	That must be really hard without audience feedback
8899000	8901000	Or immediate feedback I should say
8901000	8903000	It is weird watching
8903000	8905000	Like even some of the late
8905000	8907000	The late night shows?
8907000	8909000	Yeah watching the audience
8909000	8911000	Normally laughing and stuff like that
8911000	8913000	Having their jokes without any of that
8913000	8915000	It's a little weird
8915000	8917000	I did watch some of the Saturday Night Live
8917000	8919000	And it was weird
8919000	8921000	Yeah I mean I appreciate that they did it
8921000	8923000	And they tried it but it was a little weird
8923000	8925000	But again for Twitch's benefit
8925000	8927000	When it comes to those types of performances
8927000	8929000	They have the chat room
8929000	8931000	So they are getting that stuff
8931000	8933000	I mean it might not be the actual audio laughter
8933000	8935000	But they do get their ha ha ha's
8935000	8937000	And their lol's and their emote icon spams
8937000	8939000	In real time and at least it shows them
8939000	8941000	Oh somebody's out there I'm not just talking to myself
8941000	8943000	And that goes a long way
8943000	8945000	Anybody that's done streaming before knows
8945000	8947000	Even though you still need to stream
8947000	8949000	Even when nobody's watching
8949000	8951000	And you need to act like the world's watching
8951000	8953000	It does sure feel a lot better
8953000	8955000	And rewarding when even one person
8955000	8957000	Is there saying hi
8957000	8959000	Oh lol or you know even this littlest thing
8959000	8961000	Will kind of like give you that motivation
8961000	8963000	To keep going for a long time
8963000	8965000	So anyway
8965000	8967000	Let's move on
8967000	8969000	So we already talked about the climate story
8969000	8971000	DarkSakura did that before she left
8971000	8973000	So let's go to Loki with our next story
8973000	8975000	Yeah so this is kind of cool
8975000	8977000	So you've been seeing a lot of company
8979000	8981000	Loki you're cutting out so bad
8981000	8983000	I don't know if there's even anything we can do about it
8983000	8985000	What I'm going to try to do
8985000	8987000	I'm going to reestablish your connection here
8987000	8989000	Can you just hang up on the channel
8989000	8991000	And come right back to reestablish your connection
8991000	8993000	Literally turn it off and then on again
8993000	8995000	It's the first thing I want to try
8995000	8997000	See if that helps
8997000	8999000	Because I don't know about you guys but it's very bad
8999000	9001000	Okay try again Loki
9001000	9003000	Alright
9003000	9005000	How's that? So far so good
9005000	9007000	Cool
9007000	9009000	Yeah I think there's just internet issues
9009000	9011000	And there's mosquitoes in the house
9011000	9013000	Okay
9013000	9015000	So anyways
9015000	9017000	So you have different companies actually stepping up
9017000	9019000	To build
9019000	9021000	Ventilators and one of those now is actually
9021000	9023000	A PC company of course
9023000	9025000	Main Gear
9025000	9027000	Who does a lot of different cases and whatnot
9027000	9029000	And so they're actually building
9029000	9031000	A ventilator called the Liv
9031000	9033000	And it's basically
9033000	9035000	It looks like it's built out of one of their old cases
9035000	9037000	But
9037000	9039000	It's a complex
9039000	9041000	Oxygen delivery system
9041000	9043000	With a touch screen interface
9043000	9045000	And they say it can supply
9045000	9047000	Oxygen in 1.5 seconds
9047000	9049000	So pretty awesome that they're
9049000	9051000	Going to be manufacturing that
9051000	9053000	They said
9053000	9055000	It can be manufactured at a scale
9055000	9057000	At a quarter of the price of traditional
9057000	9059000	Ventilators
9059000	9061000	Though it's pending FDA approval
9061000	9063000	But looks neat
9063000	9065000	I hope those sorts of things
9065000	9067000	Like FDA approval don't take so
9067000	9069000	Long that by the time they're able to do it
9069000	9071000	It doesn't matter anymore you know
9071000	9073000	Yeah I think a lot of that stuff is kind of relaxed a little bit
9073000	9075000	Because of the pandemic situation
9075000	9077000	But
9077000	9079000	I have a feeling that
9079000	9081000	The process will be a little bit quicker
9081000	9083000	And not to get like political
9083000	9085000	Or too off topic but I kind of think
9085000	9087000	These guys are getting ahead of the curve
9087000	9089000	Because I think what's going to happen
9089000	9091000	Is I think they are going to
9091000	9093000	I think they are going to invoke
9093000	9095000	That defense act or whatever it's called
9095000	9097000	And they're going to force more companies
9097000	9099000	To be creating things like tests
9099000	9101000	And ventilators and things to help
9101000	9103000	I'm kind of surprised it hasn't already happened
9103000	9105000	But I think they're going to force a lot more companies
9105000	9107000	To make these things in mass
9107000	9109000	So that we can have the appropriate level
9109000	9111000	Of response I really think that's
9111000	9113000	How this ends
9113000	9115000	Or not how it ends but how
9115000	9117000	We have a path to normalcy
9117000	9119000	I'll put it that way
9119000	9121000	But we'll see again I'm not a politician
9121000	9123000	That's just my tinfoil hat talking
9123000	9125000	But to bring it back to games
9125000	9127000	As you're seeing in this particular story
9127000	9129000	Game makers are not necessarily
9129000	9131000	Immune from that type of order
9131000	9133000	Right? So
9133000	9135000	I just ordered PC parts actually
9135000	9137000	Because my computer has been doing this weird
9137000	9139000	Like locking up thing lately
9139000	9141000	And I was like you know what I just want to buy new parts anyway
9141000	9143000	I actually got a new graphics card and I'm surprised
9143000	9145000	A. I was able to find one
9145000	9147000	And B. it got here as fast as it did
9147000	9149000	Because I was quoted the end of the month
9149000	9151000	For the card to get here and it showed up yesterday
9151000	9153000	So I was like alright I'll take it
9153000	9155000	But
9155000	9157000	I have a new graphics card for my games I'm really excited
9157000	9159000	Alright
9159000	9161000	That's cool? Yeah
9161000	9163000	Alright let's move on
9163000	9165000	Last story here before we get to
9165000	9167000	I think we are going to try to take calls tonight
9167000	9169000	Because somebody told me they wanted to call in
9169000	9171000	And I really wanted to hear from this person
9171000	9173000	So I was like alright not that I don't
9173000	9175000	I was like okay alright you know what I need to try to get
9175000	9177000	The discord call thing working again
9177000	9179000	So we're going to try to do it tonight
9179000	9181000	And video we need to do video too
9181000	9183000	Yeah we need to get video running again
9183000	9185000	I didn't think this would be for that long
9185000	9187000	So I wasn't going to force that issue
9187000	9189000	But here we are
9189000	9191000	So yeah that'll probably be a thing that comes
9191000	9193000	Just don't rush me
9193000	9195000	Alright if you want to call into the show
9195000	9197000	Join the green room
9197000	9199000	We'll get some folks here on the show
9199000	9201000	So get in the green room just like always
9201000	9203000	We're hiding in a different channel but go to the green room
9203000	9205000	And I'll still put you in the place you need to be
9205000	9207000	Alright
9207000	9209000	For now let's talk about a 35 year old bug
9209000	9211000	That's been patched
9211000	9213000	Or at least that's the way it's being reported
9213000	9215000	Although I'm not so sure I draw the same conclusion
9215000	9217000	However
9217000	9219000	An admin and a writer at the cutting room floor website
9219000	9221000	Which is a really cool website by the way
9221000	9223000	But the admin Gold S has released a patch
9223000	9225000	For Super Mario Brothers
9225000	9227000	Yes the 35 year old game on the Nintendo Entertainment System
9227000	9229000	That will change Lakitu's behavior
9229000	9231000	In saying in a quote
9231000	9233000	The spiny eggs are thrown by Lakitu
9233000	9235000	In a simple way
9235000	9237000	With no horizontal movement whatsoever
9237000	9239000	However
9239000	9241000	This is not the intended behavior
9241000	9243000	And is actually the result of a bug
9243000	9245000	The eggs are supposed to be thrown out
9245000	9247000	Relative to the player's speed
9247000	9249000	Lakitu's speed, the player's position
9249000	9251000	And a pseudo random value
9251000	9253000	As well as bounce off any blocks
9253000	9255000	Or walls that they hit on the way down
9255000	9257000	So how the heck did he find that this was a bug
9257000	9259000	He's just kind of assuming this was a bug
9259000	9261000	Right
9261000	9263000	But apparently when looking at the code
9263000	9265000	It was kind of one of those things where it's like
9265000	9267000	The code is in here but it wasn't really calling on it
9267000	9269000	Da da da da da
9269000	9271000	So that's where this patch came from
9271000	9273000	I'm really oversimplifying but I gotta try and keep this short
9273000	9275000	But
9275000	9277000	One could also argue
9277000	9279000	How many times has this game been re-released
9279000	9281000	At this point
9281000	9283000	We had the Wii version
9283000	9285000	We had the Super Mario All-Stars
9285000	9287000	We had the Game Boy Advance
9287000	9289000	We had the Game Boy Color
9289000	9291000	This game has come out again a fucking lot of times
9291000	9293000	And did they ever change it?
9293000	9295000	No
9295000	9297000	So was it truly a bug
9297000	9299000	Or was it one of those things where it's like
9299000	9301000	We just accepted that this is the way it is
9301000	9303000	And so we're not going to change it
9303000	9305000	I think that maybe they just didn't want to fix it
9305000	9307000	Because that's how it's always played
9307000	9309000	And it would be weird if we changed something
9309000	9311000	But it is interesting
9311000	9313000	And Dr. Suya says I just thought this was neat
9313000	9315000	Oh no, don't get me wrong, it is neat
9315000	9317000	And I'm not saying anything bad
9317000	9319000	Or mean against the person that found it
9319000	9321000	I do think it's neat, I do think it's cool
9321000	9323000	And it is just an interesting
9323000	9325000	It is an interesting relic of
9325000	9327000	We can't really patch the old games
9327000	9329000	So
9329000	9331000	Even though I'm saying maybe it just
9331000	9333000	It just kind of became accepted as the norm
9333000	9335000	It's interesting to think
9335000	9337000	Because Nintendo could not fix it
9337000	9339000	Did that just become embraced as the norm
9339000	9341000	Lakitu's behavior and that's why it was never
9341000	9343000	Fixed in a later release
9343000	9345000	That might really be the reason
9345000	9347000	We'll never know
9347000	9349000	But if Super Mario Brothers were released today
9349000	9351000	They could fix it
9351000	9353000	I mean that's what they do with Animal Crossing
9353000	9355000	So Nintendo can fix things
9355000	9357000	They can patch things, they do it all the time now
9357000	9359000	So it's just interesting
9359000	9361000	YYR in chat says do we know for a fact
9361000	9363000	That this was never changed in later versions
9363000	9365000	They did make at least some changes
9365000	9367000	In later versions
9367000	9369000	Specifically
9369000	9371000	Like All Stars
9371000	9373000	I'm sorry, specifically Lakitu's behavior
9373000	9375000	No, is not
9375000	9377000	Different
9377000	9379000	There's a great little side by side comparison
9379000	9381000	If you want to look at news stories on this
9381000	9383000	I was looking at an article at RetroRGB.com
9383000	9385000	That had this article
9385000	9387000	I think this was actually linked in our Discord
9387000	9389000	Because I know I stole a lot of stories from our Discord tonight
9389000	9391000	So thank you all to the Discord community
9391000	9393000	Over at vognetwork.com
9393000	9395000	Where I do borrow stories
9395000	9397000	Especially on news weeks
9397000	9399000	Where everybody's in quarantine
9399000	9401000	So the companies aren't always putting out news
9401000	9403000	At the same length
9403000	9405000	But anyway, I'm looking at this
9405000	9407000	And there's a nice little gif or a video here on the page
9407000	9409000	That actually shows the before and after behavior
9409000	9411000	And you definitely see in the after
9411000	9413000	You see how the eggs have more of an arc
9413000	9415000	More of a curvature
9415000	9417000	To the way they're thrown
9417000	9419000	Whereas in the normal game they just kind of go
9419000	9421000	They kind of just plop down
9421000	9423000	And you kind of outrun them in the normal game
9423000	9425000	Whereas with the arcing
9425000	9427000	It makes it a lot harder. You have to actually dodge them quite a bit
9427000	9429000	It does, it does. It's interesting
9429000	9431000	It's interesting
9431000	9433000	SSJ100Matt in chat says, Miyamoto is willing to fix it
9433000	9435000	But you have to put in a support ticket and he has to be billed
9435000	9437000	At his regular rate from 1985
9437000	9439000	I don't know about that
9439000	9441000	I don't know
9441000	9443000	I wonder how often
9443000	9445000	He gets in there and programs things anymore
9445000	9447000	I don't know. Alright
9447000	9449000	Let's get to some calls
9449000	9451000	I see a couple folks in the green room
9451000	9453000	So let's try this out and we'll see how it goes
9453000	9455000	Hello, you're on Orange Sounds Radio. Who's this?
9455000	9457000	Hello, it's Delvin from VG Realness
9457000	9459000	What a surprise to hear from you
9459000	9461000	Hi Delvin
9461000	9463000	Don't act like it's a surprise
9463000	9465000	I just missed hearing from you
9465000	9467000	I missed talking to you
9467000	9469000	And I just, I missed the world
9469000	9471000	The way it used to be, but how are you?
9471000	9473000	I'm doing great
9473000	9475000	I've been enjoying
9475000	9477000	The hell out of Final Fantasy 7
9477000	9479000	Which is what I'm here for
9479000	9481000	To talk about
9481000	9483000	Okay, before I let you talk about that, can I just say
9483000	9485000	Because I had to say
9485000	9487000	You came out here to visit and you were on an episode of OLR
9487000	9489000	Like a year and a half ago, right?
9489000	9491000	And I keep saying, I'm gonna go to Toronto
9491000	9493000	I'm gonna return the favor, I'm gonna go to Toronto
9493000	9495000	Last year I couldn't go
9495000	9497000	Because I ended up changing jobs
9497000	9499000	Right in the midst of that
9499000	9501000	And so I didn't have any time off, I couldn't do it
9501000	9503000	So this year I was all gung-ho about going
9503000	9505000	And then, womp womp, pandemic
9505000	9507000	Toronto Pride gets cancelled
9507000	9509000	And now the gag is
9509000	9511000	You're not even gonna be in Toronto much longer, right?
9513000	9515000	Well, who knows at this point
9515000	9517000	I guess that's true
9517000	9519000	Anyway, so I just
9519000	9521000	Yeah, it's just one of those running jokes
9521000	9523000	I'll go visit Delbert and return eventually
9523000	9525000	But anyway
9525000	9527000	In the meantime, you've been playing Final Fantasy 7
9527000	9529000	Yes, I have been playing it
9529000	9531000	And let me just preface this by saying
9531000	9533000	I had to take a phone call
9533000	9535000	Right at the moment when you started talking about it
9535000	9537000	So if I'm repeating anything that you said earlier, I apologize
9537000	9539000	Repeat away
9539000	9541000	I've been enjoying the game a lot
9541000	9543000	And I have a different perspective
9543000	9545000	On the game that I don't know that
9545000	9547000	Many people do
9547000	9549000	Is that I didn't play the original
9549000	9551000	Not by
9551000	9553000	A choice
9553000	9555000	I tried to play the first one
9555000	9557000	And I had a little brother
9557000	9559000	And anyone who has a little brother
9559000	9561000	May have also experienced this issue
9561000	9563000	They like to delete save files
9563000	9565000	Off from your games
9565000	9567000	It doesn't matter what it is
9567000	9569000	It could be a game that they don't even play
9569000	9571000	They would just go and delete your save file
9571000	9573000	I don't know why
9573000	9575000	But he did this multiple times
9575000	9577000	When I had it on PlayStation
9577000	9579000	And then I said, okay fine, forget it
9579000	9581000	I'm gonna play it on PC
9581000	9583000	So then I started it on PC
9583000	9585000	Way back when it was
9585000	9587000	98 or whenever
9587000	9589000	Yep
9589000	9591000	And then my computer crashed
9591000	9593000	So I lost the save file again
9593000	9595000	So I said, you know what?
9595000	9597000	This is just not meant to be
9597000	9599000	And I just never played it
9599000	9601000	Because I was like
9601000	9603000	I can't play disc one anymore
9603000	9605000	God is sending a message
9605000	9607000	Message received
9607000	9609000	Yes, message received
9609000	9611000	I'm not to play this game
9611000	9613000	So I left it alone
9613000	9615000	So anyway, here I am now playing this game
9615000	9617000	And it's really good
9617000	9619000	And the battles
9619000	9621000	Are really seamless
9621000	9623000	Honestly
9623000	9625000	This game feels like
9625000	9627000	This is maybe how they wanted
9627000	9629000	Final Fantasy 15 to feel
9629000	9631000	And what they were
9631000	9633000	Going for but didn't quite hit the
9633000	9635000	Mark because they ran out of time
9635000	9637000	But the battle
9637000	9639000	System just feels very fluid
9639000	9641000	And I mean in 15, yes it was
9641000	9643000	But this is just like perfected
9643000	9645000	At this point
9645000	9647000	So totally really good
9647000	9649000	But what really has me
9649000	9651000	Irritated is
9651000	9653000	The fans
9653000	9655000	Of Final Fantasy
9655000	9657000	And the haters
9657000	9659000	Get her Jade
9659000	9661000	I don't know
9661000	9663000	Where this hatred
9663000	9665000	And vitriol is coming from
9665000	9667000	For some people
9667000	9669000	Some of the comments I'm seeing online
9669000	9671000	Is that, oh you're paying $60
9671000	9673000	To replay something in better
9673000	9675000	Graphics just to pay another
9675000	9677000	$60 for some quote unquote
9677000	9679000	DLC when and
9679000	9681000	If it arrives. So some people
9681000	9683000	Are even going as far to say
9683000	9685000	Oh well Square's not even going to finish
9685000	9687000	The game. They're only going to release
9687000	9689000	One and maybe two and then not even
9689000	9691000	Release the completed
9691000	9693000	Product. And
9693000	9695000	I don't even understand where
9695000	9697000	That comment comes from. Why they
9697000	9699000	Would leave that money
9699000	9701000	On the table to not finish it
9701000	9703000	A fundamental misunderstanding
9703000	9705000	That this is not the same product
9705000	9707000	Anymore. That's
9707000	9709000	The other thing
9709000	9711000	Again I haven't played the original
9711000	9713000	So I don't know but just going on
9713000	9715000	Comments and things from
9715000	9717000	People who have played the game such as yourself
9717000	9719000	And other friends
9719000	9721000	This is not disc
9721000	9723000	One as it was
9723000	9725000	In its original game
9725000	9727000	Which is what a lot of people
9727000	9729000	Are making the comparison. A lot of people are saying
9729000	9731000	Oh it's just disc one in
9731000	9733000	Better graphics and
9733000	9735000	That's not what really is being put here
9735000	9737000	And then there's gamers who have
9737000	9739000	This purest attitude
9739000	9741000	Towards the game and saying
9741000	9743000	They don't want to buy the game until
9743000	9745000	It's completed
9745000	9747000	Because they feel it's incomplete or it's not long enough
9747000	9749000	And my argument
9749000	9751000	Towards that is
9751000	9753000	A lot of people are saying
9753000	9755000	Okay the game is only 30 to 40 hours
9755000	9757000	It's not long enough so it's not justifiable
9757000	9759000	To have the $60 price tag
9759000	9761000	$80 if you live in Canada
9761000	9763000	But whatever
9763000	9765000	And the way games
9765000	9767000	Are going today
9767000	9769000	Games are generally 30 to 40 hours
9769000	9771000	Long and
9771000	9773000	You know for those
9773000	9775000	Diehard RPG fans which I am
9775000	9777000	A diehard RPG person as well
9777000	9779000	We have to really think
9779000	9781000	And consider what was a 100 hour
9781000	9783000	RPG game back in the day
9783000	9785000	Was it really
9785000	9787000	100 hours worth of story
9787000	9789000	Or
9789000	9791000	Was at least a minimum
9791000	9793000	Of 40% of that time
9793000	9795000	So 40 hours of that gameplay
9795000	9797000	Grinding
9797000	9799000	Replaying dungeons
9799000	9801000	Over and over killing things
9801000	9803000	Over and over and over and over
9803000	9805000	To make the game feel like it's
9805000	9807000	100 hours
9807000	9809000	I mean
9809000	9811000	Don't get me wrong there are some games that
9811000	9813000	I truly enjoy that
9813000	9815000	But I don't want the game to be
9815000	9817000	100 hours
9817000	9819000	Quote unquote
9819000	9821000	Just and then
9821000	9823000	Making me have to grind
9823000	9825000	To make the game artificially feel
9825000	9827000	Longer just so RPG purists
9827000	9829000	Can be like oh yeah I can
9829000	9831000	Buy this game now because it's 60
9831000	9833000	It's 100 hours
9833000	9835000	And I don't know about your impression of what you've played so far
9835000	9837000	But for me like when you are in that main
9837000	9839000	Story this game has you
9839000	9841000	By the balls and does not let go
9841000	9843000	Like you are like it is intense
9843000	9845000	Maybe when you're doing side quests
9845000	9847000	And stuff you get a little bit of a cool down period
9847000	9849000	But like god you need it
9849000	9851000	Like
9851000	9853000	Let me have a nap for a minute
9853000	9855000	There's a lot going on
9855000	9857000	Like I mean I'm not like
9857000	9859000	Super like
9859000	9861000	Pro at like you know games and there were
9861000	9863000	Some battles where I like I died
9863000	9865000	Are you playing on normal or easy?
9865000	9867000	I'm playing on normal
9867000	9869000	Oh okay well that's to be expected
9870000	9872000	Yeah there were some battles I
9872000	9874000	I died and
9874000	9876000	It also goes against
9876000	9878000	That old school RPG mentality
9878000	9880000	Like I really think to get through
9880000	9882000	Normal mode even you have to
9882000	9884000	Use potions and high potions
9884000	9886000	Whereas like in the old Final Fantasy games
9886000	9888000	We would stockpile that shit
9888000	9890000	Like I got 99 potions in my inventory
9890000	9892000	I might need them I might need them
9892000	9894000	No you are never going to use those potions
9894000	9896000	Because you never do
9896000	9898000	The remake
9899000	9901000	So my number one advice to you
9901000	9903000	Delvin on those
9903000	9905000	Use the fucking potions
9905000	9907000	Oh honey
9907000	9909000	Honey
9909000	9911000	She is buying the potions
9911000	9913000	She is hitting the vendors
9913000	9915000	When they're on sale
9915000	9917000	Oh this merchant has it on sale
9917000	9919000	I'm buying them
9919000	9921000	I'm buying all of them
9921000	9923000	Trust and believe
9923000	9925000	All of them
9925000	9927000	But yeah it's crazy
9927000	9929000	I don't know where this attitude
9929000	9931000	Is coming from from people about this game
9931000	9933000	They want it to be a hundred hour
9933000	9935000	Experience
9935000	9937000	They don't feel like it's long enough
9937000	9939000	And I just really wish that people would put that thought
9939000	9941000	Out of their minds
9941000	9943000	This not being a complete game
9943000	9945000	You know and by that same
9945000	9947000	Thought you know
9947000	9949000	Do we look at movie trilogies as incomplete
9949000	9951000	You know like the Avengers
9951000	9953000	Whole movie saga
9953000	9955000	Do we just
9956000	9958000	We know more of it's coming
9958000	9960000	So I'm not going to go and watch
9960000	9962000	Captain America
9962000	9964000	Because I know it's not a complete movie
9964000	9966000	It's going to continue
9966000	9968000	That's just a bad attitude
9968000	9970000	You used the same argument I used on somebody on Twitter this week
9970000	9972000	Which is somebody I like a lot
9972000	9974000	So I don't want to make it sound like I'm fighting him
9974000	9976000	Or I'm cutting him down
9976000	9978000	But somebody whose opinion I value
9978000	9980000	Replied to one of my tweets and said
9980000	9982000	Well I don't really want to play the Final Fantasy 7 remake
9982000	9984000	Until the whole thing is available
9985000	9987000	And I just replied and I said
9987000	9989000	You know you got to do what's best for you
9989000	9991000	I said but I hope by that logic
9991000	9993000	You didn't watch any of the Harry Potter movies
9993000	9995000	Until all eight of them were out
9995000	9997000	Well I mean yeah
9997000	9999000	I don't know it just doesn't make sense to me
9999000	10001000	Some of these comments
10001000	10003000	That are being made that I'm seeing on Facebook
10003000	10005000	And social media
10005000	10007000	It's just unfounded
10007000	10009000	And what I will also say
10009000	10011000	One last thing
10011000	10013000	Is that
10013000	10015000	What Square is doing here
10015000	10017000	I would really like to see them
10017000	10019000	Go back and give this kind of refresh
10019000	10021000	On some of the other games
10021000	10023000	Because this is
10023000	10025000	And I don't like that they even call it a remake
10025000	10027000	Because it's not
10027000	10029000	What we have instilled in our head as a remake
10029000	10031000	This is not a remake
10031000	10033000	This is a complete retelling of a game
10033000	10035000	So to speak
10035000	10037000	Ooh I like that
10037000	10039000	I'm going to steal that one too
10039000	10041000	Retelling, reinvention, reimagining
10041000	10043000	For gamers to expect
10043000	10045000	You know
10045000	10047000	A developer to make
10047000	10049000	Such a game
10049000	10051000	That was originally 3 disc
10051000	10053000	100 hours and still release that
10053000	10055000	For you know 60 dollars
10055000	10057000	I still think it's a little bit
10057000	10059000	Unrealistic in today's world
10059000	10061000	And the reason I say
10061000	10063000	That is because
10063000	10065000	A developer can make a game
10065000	10067000	That is like
10067000	10069000	A single player game not talking about like the destinies
10069000	10071000	And the whatevers that are like
10071000	10073000	Constant ongoing games
10073000	10075000	Like a single player experience game
10075000	10077000	You have to think about
10077000	10079000	The amount of hours that would go into developing a game
10079000	10081000	To make a game that's say
10081000	10083000	100 hours worth of content
10083000	10085000	Not everybody is going to play that
10085000	10087000	Let's be real, how many of us
10087000	10089000	Have single player games that we've bought
10089000	10091000	And are sitting on our shelves incomplete
10091000	10093000	So we want developers
10093000	10095000	To put all this effort into
10095000	10097000	Making these games
10097000	10099000	So long that nobody finishes them
10099000	10101000	And they don't make
10101000	10103000	The money from
10103000	10105000	I just want to know it's there
10105000	10107000	I just want to know that the next time
10107000	10109000	There's a pandemic
10109000	10111000	I'll have entertainment
10111000	10113000	I just want that peace of mind
10113000	10115000	But no, I just think it doesn't make sense
10115000	10117000	So I think this is a good approach
10117000	10119000	Honestly, it may seem
10119000	10121000	Like price gouging
10121000	10123000	Like square trying to take our money
10123000	10125000	But really it's not, they're really giving us a completely
10125000	10127000	Different experience, the game is amazing
10127000	10129000	It's gorgeous
10129000	10131000	So to any haters out there I say
10131000	10133000	Put that thought out of your head
10133000	10135000	Go enjoy the game
10135000	10137000	I do want to say this
10137000	10139000	It's okay to not like the game
10139000	10141000	I want to make that clear
10141000	10143000	I don't want to say, oh my god something's wrong with you
10143000	10145000	Well I don't want to say
10145000	10147000	Oh there's something wrong with you
10147000	10149000	If you dislike the Final Fantasy 7 remake
10149000	10151000	Maybe it's just not your type of game
10151000	10153000	Maybe the battle system
10153000	10155000	There might be
10155000	10157000	But my point is
10157000	10159000	Know what it is you don't like
10159000	10161000	About the game
10161000	10163000	Don't assume you know
10163000	10165000	What you don't like about the game
10165000	10167000	Therein is the difference
10167000	10169000	Yes, I totally agree
10169000	10171000	So I just want to make that clear
10171000	10173000	Because I don't want somebody to feel like
10173000	10175000	Oh my god, is Rob going to drag me
10175000	10177000	If I don't like Final Fantasy 7 remake
10177000	10179000	No, as long as you know what it is
10179000	10181000	You don't like
10181000	10183000	Alright
10183000	10185000	Every time I see this whole like
10185000	10187000	Well I don't like it because it's only 10% of the original game
10187000	10189000	I'm just like, then you clearly haven't played it
10189000	10191000	No
10191000	10193000	And you're just making a
10193000	10195000	Flip in statement
10195000	10197000	You didn't even bother to look at the demo
10197000	10199000	You're making a snap judgment based off what everybody else on Twitter said
10199000	10201000	Your opinion is wrong
10201000	10203000	Sorry
10203000	10205000	This has actually inspired me now
10205000	10207000	I just actually downloaded Final Fantasy 7
10207000	10209000	On my Switch, the original
10209000	10211000	I'm dying to see
10211000	10213000	What's changed
10213000	10215000	I want to see how the first few hours of the game
10215000	10217000	Played out versus this
10217000	10219000	Just to see how different it is
10219000	10221000	Ok, so like when I was
10221000	10223000	Doing chapter 3
10223000	10225000	And again I got to keep things very vague
10225000	10227000	Because I don't want to spoil for those that haven't even touched the game yet
10227000	10229000	But when I was doing chapter 3
10229000	10231000	I was like, I swear
10231000	10233000	This sequence was like
10233000	10235000	5 minutes in the original game
10235000	10237000	Like you go to this area, you talk to somebody
10237000	10239000	And then you're on to the next area
10239000	10241000	You're not spending the type of time
10241000	10243000	So I had to go back
10243000	10245000	I actually looked at a playthrough
10245000	10247000	Somebody had one of those
10247000	10249000	5 hour plays
10249000	10251000	Maybe that's how I got on the part 23 and all that stuff
10251000	10253000	But somebody had a Final Fantasy 7
10253000	10255000	Playthrough and the whole
10255000	10257000	Midgar section was 5 hours
10257000	10259000	And I was watching it and I caught myself watching it
10259000	10261000	And I was like, this, ok
10261000	10263000	Some of these things
10263000	10265000	Were definitely not the same
10265000	10267000	I probably should have
10267000	10269000	Considered just watching on YouTube
10269000	10271000	Instead of downloading a game
10271000	10273000	But whatever
10273000	10275000	It's not like, like the question that came up earlier
10275000	10277000	You know, is Final Fantasy
10277000	10279000	Remake then better than the original?
10279000	10281000	I don't, like better is a very
10281000	10283000	Relative term, like the original
10283000	10285000	Is good for its own reasons
10285000	10287000	It's not the same game anymore
10287000	10289000	That's the reality
10289000	10291000	Yeah, that's like saying, is Final Fantasy 7
10291000	10293000	Better than Super Mario Brothers?
10293000	10295000	I
10295000	10297000	That depends on a lot of factors
10299000	10301000	Absolutely
10301000	10303000	Alright Delvin, I so appreciate your opinion
10303000	10305000	Are you producing any content these days?
10305000	10307000	Are you still streaming or what?
10307000	10309000	You got something to plug here?
10309000	10311000	I only stream like very
10311000	10313000	Very rarely
10313000	10315000	Every now and then on my Twitch channel
10315000	10317000	Twitch.tv slash VG Realness
10317000	10319000	Go ahead, throw a follow
10319000	10321000	And turn your notifications on so you know when I'm
10321000	10323000	Streaming, but it's
10323000	10325000	Here and there, but I'm probably gonna be
10325000	10327000	Doing it a little bit more now as we are in quarantine
10327000	10329000	But I need to finish FF7
10329000	10331000	First, because as we just talked about
10331000	10333000	It's not that interesting to watch
10333000	10335000	Well not that it's not interesting, it's just
10335000	10337000	Not good content
10337000	10339000	But I will say this, I
10339000	10341000	Downloaded and played Dotless because of you
10341000	10343000	Because you were streaming it one night and I was like
10343000	10345000	Oh I need to check out this game and then I tried playing it and I was terrible at it
10345000	10347000	Hey, it's free
10347000	10349000	It is free, so hey, I didn't lose any money
10349000	10351000	So
10351000	10353000	Alright, Delvin, thank you so much
10353000	10355000	It was so great to have you on the show
10355000	10357000	Thanks for having me
10357000	10359000	Take care my friend, bye bye
10359000	10361000	There was another person in the green room
10361000	10363000	But they disappeared, so I guess they changed their mind
10363000	10365000	But I'll give it another minute to see if anybody comes back
10365000	10367000	In the meantime, do we have any last minute
10367000	10369000	Stories, Loki?
10369000	10371000	Yes we do, so apparently
10371000	10373000	You may remember the whole
10373000	10375000	Atari VCS console
10375000	10377000	Well, we talked a little bit
10377000	10379000	Back in October about how
10379000	10381000	This company, Tin Giant
10381000	10383000	Had resigned
10383000	10385000	From project development
10385000	10387000	Because they were saying that they were
10387000	10389000	Citing six months worth of
10389000	10391000	Unpaid invoice as well now
10391000	10393000	Tin Giant, the head of
10393000	10395000	That company, Rob White, has
10395000	10397000	Formally filed a suit
10397000	10399000	In Colorado Federal Court
10399000	10401000	Claimed to breach a contract to the tune
10401000	10403000	Of $261,000
10403000	10405000	Because of unpaid
10405000	10407000	Contracts
10407000	10409000	So
10409000	10411000	It'll be interesting to see what happens here
10411000	10413000	I don't know
10413000	10415000	I didn't ever hear anything positive coming out
10415000	10417000	Of this Atari console, and I don't even know
10417000	10419000	When it's supposed to be coming out
10419000	10421000	The most recent release date apparently
10421000	10423000	Of the console was March 2020
10423000	10425000	And we haven't heard anything new yet
10425000	10427000	Well, I'll cut them a little slack
10427000	10429000	Because I'm sure the pandemic situation screwed everything up
10429000	10431000	Let's be real
10431000	10433000	The buzz for that Atari system
10433000	10435000	Wasn't there
10435000	10437000	Let's not mince words
10437000	10439000	The buzz for that Atari system just ain't fucking there
10439000	10441000	It's a very different story
10441000	10443000	Than say Intellivision last week
10443000	10445000	Obviously Bobby had Tommy
10445000	10447000	On his show and it was a great interview
10447000	10449000	I hope you guys all got to check that out
10449000	10451000	And he's working hard
10451000	10453000	To build buzz
10453000	10455000	He even stopped by our little tiny
10455000	10457000	Tent in the slums
10457000	10459000	Here of podcasting
10459000	10461000	To talk about Intellivision
10461000	10463000	Bobby's talking about that Atari system
10463000	10465000	Yeah, in fact
10465000	10467000	According to the lawsuit
10467000	10469000	Tim Giant actually
10469000	10471000	They basically said that
10471000	10473000	In fact it was Atari's own mismanagement
10473000	10475000	Of the console project that was the cause
10475000	10477000	Of the reason
10477000	10479000	Or reason for delayed launch
10479000	10481000	So
10481000	10483000	I want to mention this
10483000	10485000	In chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network
10485000	10487000	Because Pod Culture was the person that was trying to get through
10487000	10489000	On Discord and had some
10489000	10491000	So Pod Culture says
10491000	10493000	Just a quick anecdote about sending Christina
10493000	10495000	My OG Switch
10495000	10497000	So she could play Animal Crossing
10497000	10499000	New Horizons
10499000	10501000	While locked down
10501000	10503000	You know you're actually not the first person I've heard doing that
10503000	10505000	Because I guess the Switches are so hard to come by
10505000	10507000	I've heard of like people mailing their relatives
10507000	10509000	Because some people have a second Switch
10509000	10511000	Lying around because they might have bought the Switch Lite
10511000	10513000	Or they might have bought that Animal Crossing Switch
10513000	10515000	Or what have you
10515000	10517000	So for whatever reason they upgraded
10517000	10519000	You're actually not the first I've heard of somebody doing that
10519000	10521000	I only have one Switch
10521000	10523000	So I don't have one to mail out
10523000	10525000	But I have definitely heard of that
10525000	10527000	So that is a very interesting side effect
10527000	10529000	Of not many Switches being available
10529000	10531000	Either
10531000	10533000	So anyway
10533000	10535000	Just wanted to get that comment out there
10535000	10537000	Since he couldn't make the call work
10537000	10539000	Any other last minute stories Logie?
10539000	10541000	It says apparently
10541000	10543000	That Xbox has committed to
10543000	10545000	A digital only press conference
10545000	10547000	For E3 2021
10547000	10549000	That seems like a
10549000	10551000	Long way out to me
10551000	10553000	I do remember seeing that
10553000	10555000	I was going to bundle that with the inside Xbox thing
10555000	10557000	Yeah they basically said
10557000	10559000	They've made the decision to transition
10559000	10561000	All external and internal events
10561000	10563000	To digital first experience through
10563000	10565000	July 2021
10565000	10567000	That seems like a long way out
10567000	10569000	To say you're going to do digital
10569000	10571000	But okay if it's digital first
10571000	10573000	Then I can sort of
10573000	10575000	Just going more the Nintendo route
10575000	10577000	And keeping things with the direct and so forth
10577000	10579000	It'll be interesting
10579000	10581000	Yeah so we'll see
10581000	10583000	Alright
10583000	10585000	Alright well if that's it for last minute stories
10585000	10587000	I think we'll go ahead and wrap up tonight's show
10587000	10589000	We've been going for a little while tonight
10589000	10591000	It's a little longer than our last few shows
10591000	10593000	So we have a lot to talk about tonight
10593000	10595000	But I hope everyone enjoyed the show
10595000	10597000	And I want to say thank you so much for tuning in tonight
10597000	10599000	Whether it was live here at Twitch TV
10599000	10601000	Thank you so much for being here
10601000	10603000	Whether it was on iTunes or Google Podcast
10603000	10605000	Or Spotify don't forget we're there now
10605000	10607000	Or wherever it is you listen to podcasts
10607000	10609000	Help us spread the word, tell a friend or two about the show
10609000	10611000	Because we only get folks here
10611000	10613000	Listening if they know about the show
10613000	10615000	So we are the show where every gamer has a voice
10615000	10617000	But you've got to help us recruit those voices to get here
10617000	10619000	Auto host on Twitch
10619000	10621000	Those go a long long way
10621000	10623000	More than I could ever really tell you
10623000	10625000	So please those are all fantastic as well
10625000	10627000	Really appreciate those hosts
10627000	10629000	So I think that's all I have
10629000	10631000	On that side of things
10631000	10633000	So let's wrap up with our final thoughts
10633000	10635000	Loki, have a great week
10635000	10637000	We'll see you again next week
10637000	10639000	Stay safe and let's hope we get some good news
10639000	10641000	On the curve and maybe things start to go downhill
10641000	10643000	As far as, you know what I mean
10643000	10645000	Like down the hill
10645000	10647000	Not like things going downhill
10647000	10649000	But things going down the hill on the COVID situation this week
10649000	10651000	And maybe some good news to report next week
10651000	10653000	But any last thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10653000	10655000	No that's it
10655000	10657000	Hopefully we'll play some more games this week
10657000	10659000	I would like to start working on my game
10659000	10661000	I just haven't been able to work that out
10661000	10663000	I've been switching up my grocery shopping days
10663000	10665000	And so it's
10665000	10667000	It takes a long time to grocery shop
10667000	10669000	You just have to go to three different stores
10669000	10671000	To get everything
10671000	10673000	But we were like super stocked up
10673000	10675000	So hopefully next week it'll be a little lighter
10675000	10677000	Yeah that's good
10677000	10679000	And my final thought is
10679000	10681000	We do a lot of grocery shopping too
10681000	10683000	But I really like food delivery
10683000	10685000	And supporting local restaurants
10685000	10687000	But it's so expensive
10687000	10689000	Like if we could find any way to cut the cost down
10689000	10691000	That'd be great but you know
10691000	10693000	We gotta pay the drivers
10693000	10695000	We gotta pay the restaurants and so forth
10695000	10697000	So I guess maybe I need to do a little more takeout
10697000	10699000	But it's hard because you want to help everybody
10699000	10701000	But at the end of the day
10701000	10703000	I had an amazing Thai meal from downtown
10703000	10705000	On Friday it was so good
10705000	10707000	So
10707000	10709000	I definitely know as soon as this whole thing is over
10709000	10711000	I'm going back to eating out
10711000	10713000	Because it's so good
