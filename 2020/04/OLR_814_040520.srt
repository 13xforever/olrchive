Roberts joining you here live of course with everything that's going on in the world we are

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,480
still doing the social distance thing so it's just me in the studio tonight usually my co-host

10
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,240
would be here live in studio with me instead I'm joined by Captain Pikachu and via discord we have

11
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:10,200
welcome back tonight please DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Hello. Hi I hear that you're doing a lot

12
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:17,720
better? Yeah I'm doing better enough that they deem I can work tomorrow morning if I can ever get

13
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:24,520
the stuff I need from my work computer set up here at the house but yeah my I had a chest

14
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:31,800
x-ray and it came out clear they should have given me the chest x-ray three weeks ago but you know

15
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:40,280
it is what it is so she thinks that the breathing problems I have left over just inflammation from

16
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:47,240
having had pneumonia. Wow so but you never did find out if it was the big one or not just because

17
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:54,680
the testing shortage right? Exactly and I probably won't get to find out until they have the antigen

18
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,080
test ready. Well whatever way you slice it I'm really glad to hear you're feeling a lot better

19
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,360
because I know that was kind of you know if you go back and listen to that show it was about three

20
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,080
weeks ago or so when you were first calling in and you were you were feeling sick you you really

21
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,040
didn't sound good so I'm really glad to hear you're you're doing a lot better really really

22
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,800
happy to hear it and I know a lot of folks over in our twitch chat are cheering you on as well

23
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,800
because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock pacific nine o'clock eastern

24
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,840
at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network right after of course the Bobby

25
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,560
Blackwolf show. Also joining me in studio though I want to talk about Bobby's show tonight actually

26
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,640
with who else is also joining me excuse me on discord not in studio we'll usually be in studio

27
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,440
but not tonight say hello to tech master Loki our virtual studio say hello to Loki.

28
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:43,320
I was gonna say I'm not there. Yeah in spirit or I've been in quarantine for three weeks now

29
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,800
where Pikachu is just starting to look like Loki I don't know what it is maybe I don't know how

30
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:54,280
are you doing Loki? It's the jaundice it must be the jaundice. Clearly how are you doing? I'm fine.

31
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,560
So Bobby's show tonight he had a really big night because he had Tommy Tallarico on tonight who is

32
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:06,600
the CEO of Intellivision and I don't did you hear the whole interview Loki? No I like how like the

33
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,440
last five minutes. Oh bummer you should have heard the whole thing because there was a point where

34
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,280
Bobby actually brought up some of the things we had talked about on OLR before so and I won't

35
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,120
repeat everything because I know Bobby's want to get that interview out there but Tommy actually

36
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,400
addresses some of those things about the whole like remember the the no 3d games thing although

37
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,920
that's not really what it is he kind of clarifies that quite a bit and then he talks about the whole

38
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,680
average score thing which I guess people interpreted to be a 70 score a metacritic

39
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,160
but it's actually like an internal type of rating like think Nintendo CL quality type of thing

40
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,760
but anyway it was it was a good interview Bobby and Tommy had a lot of conversation and Tommy's

41
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:52,600
great he's a great salesman pitching his product and makes a lot of good cases for the Amico and

42
00:03:52,600 --> 00:04:01,400
I can say I put down the deposit on one Thursday so I'm excited to check it out. I looked at it but

43
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:07,240
I don't know I don't know if I'm gonna do that. All right well it's I can also understand who's

44
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,200
one of those things where you got to get your hands on the games that the games are the important

45
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,520
part and I thought it was interesting how he kind of said like he actually said this may not

46
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,040
really be or this is what I heard anyway sorry I don't want to I don't want to misattribute a quote

47
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,040
or anything but kind of the message I was hearing was you know if you're like a hardcore gamer this

48
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,680
may not really be the thing for you like that's not the thing that we're designing it for so

49
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,760
that's the message I heard anyway so I thought that was interesting that you know he did have

50
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,680
that kind of like realistic approach like he definitely knows the audience he's going for and

51
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,800
I think it's I think it's very interesting he makes a good case when he kind of says

52
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:44,920
your your best memories in gaming are usually when you're together in the same room you know you

53
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,600
think back to days of like you know playing Mario Kart or things that you would play like in the

54
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,200
same room those are your great gaming memories and he wants to be able to bring those back and

55
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,840
when was the last time you were able to play a game with your family members your parents your

56
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,920
you know extended family members probably Wii Sports or something like that so I thought I

57
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,240
thought he made some really good arguments for the direction the console is going I thought it

58
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:11,240
was really good so so props to him and also I I have no idea if Tommy's still watching you

59
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,520
probably turned it off by now but uh kind of an interesting little aside about Tommy and

60
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,720
video games live specifically uh video games live and not everybody maybe necessarily knows

61
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,720
I think I might have mentioned it once before on the show but video games live is actually where I

62
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,840
met my husband Alan for the first time we knew each other online like on a blogging site years

63
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,720
and years ago but it was actually due to video games live that we met face to face for the first

64
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,680
time there was a chance meeting we didn't know that the other was going to be there it was one

65
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,800
of those type of oh you're oh you're that and it kind of like things proceeded from there as they

66
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,640
say so I do I do have Tommy to thank for that for creating video games live because if I hadn't had

67
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:55,800
that chance meeting who knows what would happen so um pretty cool anyhow let's get into uh and I

68
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,640
will just say tune into Bobby's show for the rest of it it was it was a good interview and I know

69
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:05,960
he's putting that up on youtube as well as his podcast feed usually um the video content here

70
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,640
at vog network we kind of see that as something extra because we've been doing these podcasts for

71
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:15,400
a long time 15 years 18 years uh we've been doing podcasting a long time so the audio podcast they're

72
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,680
out there free as they have always been but when we made the move to twitch we thought you know

73
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,160
video is something extra so we're gonna put that uh with the subscribe subscription thing and most

74
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,840
of you have a twitch prime uh account anyway so you get one free subscription uh excuse me amazon

75
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,560
prime um account so you get a free twitch prime subscription every month so if you consider using

76
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,760
that at vog network you get access to the whole video library but because uh this is such a big

77
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,400
thing and and there's really important news uh and things to be seen tommy did really show off

78
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,920
that controller and kind of it was showing it from all angles and stuff so there is kind of a

79
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,800
video component to that so he's gonna put that on youtube for free so that way it's not gated

80
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,280
because uh we don't want to be we don't want to be absolute uh jerks here at vog network and we don't

81
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,920
want to put the good stuff behind the paywall we're not we're not the la times putting all the

82
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:06,600
good stuff behind the paywall anyway let's move into tonight's kickoff topic something else a

83
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,400
little different going on in the gaming world um obviously with all the news around us we've got

84
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:17,480
things that are being cancelled moved shifted and all that stuff left and right and uh loki

85
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:22,360
e3 kind of or lack thereof providing some uh different moving and shaking this week right

86
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:29,000
loki right i mean so it's kind of expected that a lot of stuff around e3 well e3 already being

87
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,000
cancelled um is being postponed or cancelled as well so to go along with e3 as um we've had in

88
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,760
the past few years uh bethesda won't be doing their digital event around june um so they're

89
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:49,640
working on some alternate plans as well um to go along with that though we've got ign announcing

90
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:55,320
that they're going to be doing their own digital event called the summer of gaming uh it's supposed

91
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:02,360
to be a collaboration between several different companies 2k square enix sega bandai namco amazon

92
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:11,480
google stadia twitter developer digital thq nordic and more companies and you know they're

93
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:17,000
basically going to have some sort of event that's gonna be kind of i guess showing off some games

94
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:25,080
maybe some of the footage that we would have gotten during e3 but aren't getting um no deadline

95
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,400
or no exact date on when that's gonna happen but i'm assuming sometime during the summer

96
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:36,440
and last but not least we've got esa talking about their plans for e3 2021 with the date being set

97
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:43,800
already from 15th through the 17th june 20 of 21 and they said it's going to be their reimagined

98
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:50,760
version of e3 whatever that's supposed to mean so i don't know but it is it is interesting they're

99
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,320
using the word reimagine so that's where they're kind of setting the expectations is that this is

100
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,600
going to be a different show when it comes back in 2021 so the cancellation you know certainly

101
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:06,200
i i think covid and and the the global crisis we have going on there i think that was going to get

102
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,640
e3 eventually one way or the other but um i think it definitely goes to show that some some of this

103
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:17,080
other thought about how to reinvent a show um may have come into play with that you know again i

104
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,880
think the pandemic would have claimed the show eventually um but it is you know a lot of people

105
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,600
when they pulled the plug it did seem still kind of early on um so it's just kind of interesting

106
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,440
that they definitely are looking at what is the show going to look like in the future um right

107
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,360
and then i was going to say also to kind of clarify i dig it i did find the information

108
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,320
about the ign event that's supposed to take place in june as well yeah and it's it doesn't

109
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,360
it strike you as very i don't it's it's oddly opportunistic of ign isn't it i mean i'm not

110
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,480
that i'm saying like they're doing anything wrong i mean it's a it's a smart business move but it

111
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:58,440
is interesting that ign is jumping on that before the esa because wasn't the esa supposed to announce

112
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:04,440
a digital event or wasn't the esa supposed to be doing their own thing i thought i don't remember

113
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,000
if that's i thought that was a thing or not well they kind of um it was like they said look forward

114
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
to this but they never like confirmed it's happening here it's this time it's just kind of

115
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,520
one of those we're figuring it out as we go along type of things right and i guess you know it could

116
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,960
be that they're just trying to get you know more traffic to their i mean obviously they're trying

117
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,520
to get more traffic to their site because they make a lot of money from these collaborations

118
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:35,000
with different companies for advertising um i mean i'm sure it's just all kind of a lot of um patty

119
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,200
in the back and stuff like that but i don't know we'll see how the coverage is i mean i don't really

120
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,480
it's been so long since i've been to ign i went there today i'm like wow their sites really

121
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:52,040
changed because it's been like months if not years since i've been to ign well but i mean

122
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,560
even though i say it's a little opportunistic i mean it's smart because you know clearly if they

123
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,360
were able to sign on the dotted line to get all these companies to commit to doing these types of

124
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,840
reveals um at an ign event then clearly the esa had not thought to sign them all already which is

125
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:14,440
a severe lapse in judgment on their part uh yet another in a string of bad decisions by the esa

126
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,880
sorry but i'm calling it like it is um so ign was able to step in there smartly and get all

127
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:25,640
those uh people to sign off and now essentially they are taking the hat of being the uh digital

128
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:31,000
e3 even though they can't call it that but that is essentially what they're doing and now ign can

129
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,720
basically cock block everyone else and you know they have the exclusive video will be you know

130
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,400
going to their site to see all that stuff although we all know that shit will get ripped and put on

131
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:46,360
youtube and what have you but you know essentially ign is going to make their site the place to go

132
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:52,280
to see all of that which you know hey digital journalism kind of needs a lot of help and that

133
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:57,480
stuff right now so again i'm not like shaming or saying it's a bad thing on ign it's it's

134
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,880
fucking smart but it's interesting that they were able to do it is what i'm really saying

135
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,720
so yeah i mean i it's not surprising that they would take the opportunity to do that but

136
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,000
we'll see how the coverage is i really don't care i like my information and i feel that with all

137
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,600
these announcements that things are getting postponed and canceled that we're not going to

138
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,680
hear a lot until at least you know uh gamescom and so i don't know it'd be nice to hear something

139
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,560
during june i mean nintendo wasn't listed as one of the companies participating obviously because

140
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,440
they have their own thing that they're doing so it'll be interesting to see i thought a lot of

141
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,240
these companies were going to be doing kind of that like you know kind of the treehouse life type

142
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:46,360
of um coverage where they're just going to stream some information or gameplay for a few days um

143
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,520
i don't know well i guess we'll have to wait and see what happens well yeah and it was also

144
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,240
interesting because um you know a lot of folks were saying the e3 and i guess maybe i'm one of

145
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:01,160
these folks e3 was kind of all digestible online anyway like you know many of us would sit here and

146
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,280
watch the digital press conferences online uh we would be watching the videos as they're released

147
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,360
online it's almost like you know you could get more out of the show sitting here watching it

148
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,640
online than you actually could um at the la convention center which is you know what what

149
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:21,880
broke me on e3 and why i stopped going was when i had to fight my way to get in to see this uh

150
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,200
demo of a new assassins creed game that was just on youtube later that night you know it was kind

151
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,720
of like well if i can just consume all this stuff online anyway then what am i what am i spending

152
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,520
all the money to come to la for well the parties were always pretty good but you know realistically

153
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,360
i can't spend that kind of money and time just to party you know i can party here at home

154
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,360
so this is you know kind of kind of interesting how this may be pushing e3 to where it was at

155
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:52,040
anyway so i'm at least encouraged to hear the e3 uh and the esa kind of gets the memo

156
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,880
because sometimes i worry about that and that they are going to reimagine it for 2021 i'm just

157
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,920
so curious what that would look like and to be quite honest i'm not sure i have the answer

158
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,840
um maybe it is somewhere in that hole you know we like to party we like to get together um the

159
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:13,000
people that i know that still like to go to e3 are like well i like to see all my industry people

160
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,760
it's the one time of year i get to see all those people so maybe e3 turns into something a little

161
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:25,000
more like twitch con but it's not twitch it's the whole industry kind of thing it's kind of that's

162
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,200
kind of where i see e3 kind of going not just twitch con but everything else gone i don't know

163
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:37,880
we'll see uh we'll see what develops uh in the coming weeks and months ahead uh june all things

164
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,440
considered is not that far off it's only what about seven eight weeks off i guess it depends

165
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,400
what part of june they're going to be doing so we'll see and then of course you know the the

166
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:52,600
world situation we're facing is also rapidly developing we don't necessarily know what that's

167
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,520
going to look like in in three or four weeks or even by the time june gets here i mean obviously

168
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,240
our fingers and toes are all crossed that we get on the other side of this you know thing within

169
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,880
the next month but i think you know we're kind of mentally preparing some of us for the fact that it

170
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,600
could go on excuse me a little bit longer uh and the reason why i say that is because you know

171
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,680
we're looking to games com maybe to deliver some of the news a little later in the summer but

172
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,400
maybe there won't be a games com either don't know i mean just because this thing is over

173
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,840
does that mean we can suddenly have conventions with thousands of people again that may not

174
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,000
necessarily be the best idea i don't know i'm gonna leave it to health experts and scientists

175
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
and listen to what they have to say on the whole thing so anyhow um let's move on from e3 and talk

176
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,320
a little bit about closer to home how was your gaming week and the types of video games that

177
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,720
you've been playing this week i bet i don't have to guess very much what game dark soccer has been

178
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:48,840
spending the most of her time on what are you up to i've been playing doom kidding cool that'll be

179
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:54,840
good somebody finally played doom on the cast great playing animal crossing um and i got dan

180
00:15:54,840 --> 00:16:04,040
playing now too so dan lives on koholint island and uh i just i i visited a friend in australia

181
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,720
right before the show so i have a couple of the southern hemisphere seasonal fish right now and

182
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,640
well just a ribbon eel and a couple of the bugs um but the funniest thing is like when you catch the

183
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:23,240
red dragonfly it says i didn't even have to roll initiative nice and that one's my favorite um

184
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,960
and then um i started playing pocket camp again once i realized that there's like a code for stuff

185
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,680
that they're gonna keep doing codes like this if you're playing both games so i started playing

186
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:40,520
that again um and that's really about i did play a little pokemon go when i had to go to the doctor

187
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:48,120
um and i'm disappointed because um i live just far away enough from the the gym that i can't

188
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,560
hit it but i can hit the pokey stop in my neighbor's backyard and what i mean in my

189
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:59,080
neighbor's backyard is it's actually at this uh this uh walking path or bike path that cuts into

190
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:06,200
my neighborhood and there's a sign there and um and sometimes if my gps is being wonky i can hit

191
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:12,120
it from the corner of my backyard um but now i can just sit in my bathroom and hit the pokey stop

192
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:18,280
yeah they also doubled the distance of the gym thing so you can actually hit a gym

193
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:24,280
from twice as far away as you used to be able to um which i know i did finish a gym battle oh nice

194
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:32,360
yeah yeah sadly i'm just out of range of the closest gym to the house now but there's a second

195
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:37,800
gym in the neighborhood i got a new um portal for ingress approved in uh opr or excuse me

196
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,480
niantic wayfare and it made a new gym in the neighborhood on my walking so now i have two

197
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:48,280
gyms on my walk path so it's great you should do my mailbox in my neighborhood uh i is it like

198
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:53,640
painted or something special yeah oh okay it's like a well not painted but it's a it's a mailbox

199
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,040
it's got mail on it i'll take a look if it's just a generic mailbox those usually don't meet

200
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:04,200
criteria i probably won't go through okay yeah all right so if that's it for your gaming week

201
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:12,360
then we will go to loki all right so i did play a ton of stuff uh this week so one of the things

202
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:18,120
i did is i'm like i said i mentioned i was replacing my laptop because my old one's kind of

203
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:26,760
dying so i got a nicer laptop um that it's got like an rtx 2070 in it and you know 32 gigs of ram and

204
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:33,160
you know a nice i7 processor so i was um loading up vr games so i played a little bit of half-life

205
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:39,720
alex and that's really immersive and fun so i really enjoyed that and then i finally got

206
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:48,600
around to playing beat saber a bit so um not uh it's still you know getting used to that because

207
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:54,440
it's quite hard to play it on normal and stuff so um it was pretty fun and then of course the

208
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:00,520
big thing i did this week was convert over my uh ddr cabinet to run step mania so now i have

209
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:06,040
a set medium machine with like 2 000 songs loaded in there so i did actually play some ddr this week

210
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,680
and stuff can you go back to the old way if you want or is that a permanent change um it's not

211
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:15,480
a permanent change this requires you know unhooking some things and plugging stuff back in

212
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:21,560
um so yeah i could go back if i want um so it's definitely not permanent i wanted to get it like

213
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:27,720
so that i could switch between the two but i that would require some more uh hardware and wiring

214
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,400
stuff up but it's got everything going i mean uh the lights work and everything i bought a while

215
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:41,080
ago a lighting board for it so that i could uh use set me to control the lights um but it looks nice

216
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:46,520
um i did find out though that the tv that they replaced in there so there's an lcd tv in there

217
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:52,840
um and apparently the remote doesn't work for it so i had to disassemble the front flex or the

218
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:59,400
front like a glass that was on there in order to actually get to the uh the tv to change the

219
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,760
settings on it which is kind of funny in order to get it to work with um how i have the computer set

220
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,160
up but yeah it's been pretty cool and um i'm just trying to get everything organized right now

221
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:16,440
because it's um there's a lot of songs in there and i need to organize it so i can get it down

222
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,440
to a more manageable level because i just kind of dumped everything on there and there's a lot of

223
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,880
duplicates and stuff too so uh that's what i've really been working on so can i ask you to expand

224
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,400
on half-life alex a little more because you kind of mentioned that one really quick but you know

225
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,600
since i i think many of us don't really have vr setups what makes half-life alex kind of like

226
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,320
different than a traditional first-person shooter because i guess most people are probably thinking

227
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,040
oh it's just a first-person shooter but you're in vr like what like what do they do that makes it

228
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:51,080
like you can't do this on a monitor this is a vr game it's very immersive so like the physics

229
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,080
in the game is really good so you can grab pretty much anything interact with pretty much all of

230
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:01,560
the objects in the game um you can use them in very creative ways so for example um and i i

231
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:06,600
don't remember what they're called but there's these creatures that have these giant like

232
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:12,680
tentacle things that hang from the ceiling and so if you get caught by one of them you can

233
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:18,120
basically get eaten so what you're supposed to do is you can throw things at them to have

234
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:25,880
them grab those and they can walk by or you can wear like you can find um you know stuff on the

235
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:31,880
ground to use to help you out as well like so for example there's construction helmets around so you

236
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:37,000
can put a hard hat on um my kids were saying put the button there's a bucket on the ground so

237
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,080
they're like put it on your head and yeah again once you put a bucket on your head if you really

238
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:49,000
wanted to um you can grab markers and draw on the windows and stuff um you can you know pick up

239
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,040
glass bottles and smash them you can i don't know you can grab like a explosive gas canisters and

240
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,520
throw them at something and then fire a gun at it plus then you get gravity gloves later on so you

241
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:05,720
can start grabbing you know things out of the air you can throw stuff up and catch it it's pretty

242
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:13,320
cool um and then it's just very immersive both sound and atmosphere um it's really great it looks

243
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:20,840
like the graphics look incredible like it's just a really great looking game um so i mean i i don't

244
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:26,280
know i got to play for about like an hour or so today and it was just really fun okay cool no

245
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,920
thanks i i was kind of curious a little more just because you know especially you know thanks to

246
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,600
quarantine like you know i have a couple friends that i probably could go to their place and check

247
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,240
it out you know play it but i i can't so i i kind of have to live vicariously through others right

248
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,400
now with all this uh quarantine going on but when this is over hopefully i'll get a chance to check

249
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,360
it out yeah definitely and then also i um i picked up boneworks as well which is supposed to be

250
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,240
another really immersive vr game so i'm going to be uh looking forward to play that as well

251
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:59,000
um and then even had fun with beat saber i like turning it up because you know i'm not too like

252
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,880
accurate with the um following the arrows so i like putting on the mode where there are no

253
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,120
arrows it just hit it in any direction whatsoever and then you just put it like you know expert

254
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,680
and just go crazy and it's that's a lot of fun so be sure to pick up autica too because that's a

255
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:19,640
really good music game as well all right i'll check that yep it's harmonix's uh game and it's

256
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,360
kind of like uh imagine if elite beat agents was a vr game it's easy simple simplest way i could put

257
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:30,840
it so all right cool all right well uh let's talk about my gaming week okay so last week i mentioned

258
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:35,720
i was going to check this game out and dark soccer this game is up your alley you really

259
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:42,200
have to check this game out okay this game this game is called demon's tilt with the uh headline

260
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:48,760
or with the subheading occult pinball action and it's basically yeah it's a it's it's basically

261
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,960
somebody took like their love of devil's crush and alien crush and like made a new crush table that's

262
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,320
basically what this is they made satan crush and that's what this game is basically uh it's okay

263
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:05,400
i'm getting it like right now it's like if heavy metal the movie was a pinball table which maybe

264
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:11,960
it was i don't know but it was i like there is so much going on in the game i couldn't tell you what

265
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,440
the fuck is happening but it's really pretty and it's one of the it's it's one of those pinball

266
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,200
games just like alien crush or devil crush where there's like you start on the middle table and

267
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,040
you can fall to the lower table or you go all the way up to the upper table like it's one of those

268
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,200
things there's the multi-levels like what was that like rollerball on the nes or something was like

269
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,040
the first game i remember doing something like that but it has those whole like different levels

270
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:38,280
um so i played it on xbox game pass but i believe it is on windows and mac if i'm not mistaken and

271
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,920
uh nintendo switch so dark sakura has no shortage yeah it's on steam but i think i'll probably get

272
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:47,800
it on switch that's pretty cool yeah so uh i i feel like this game's up your alley so i would

273
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,320
feel horrible if i didn't recommend it to you so i spent a good time some good time playing this game

274
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,000
and just watching all the pretty stuff and trying to get achievements and yeah it was pretty cool

275
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,560
so uh i look forward to your review next week dark sakura uh because you're the pinball queen

276
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,080
uh but i enjoyed it i enjoyed it and that was definitely my review will be i played animal

277
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:09,960
crossing was at some point you're gonna need a break from animal crossing at some point

278
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,240
anyway uh so i played that and uh i've been playing the usual stuff too i found sc14 orna

279
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,680
diablo uh but i played some other new well okay i play one other new game i play one old game too

280
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,080
so because you know i'm stuck at home i've definitely been making use out of my xbox game

281
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:31,400
pass i also played here's a jamie game sort of king of fighters 98 how random is that is on game

282
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:37,560
pass hell yeah so i was like i'm gonna play this why not oh i can put together my dream team of

283
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:43,000
kim kapwan and my and uh andy bogart all in the team and uh yeah there's uh you know it's it's

284
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,720
ba it's the neo geo game but it's when they did it for the xbox 360 because it's uh that

285
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,280
compatibility version but i thought it was like random and cool that that was on xbox game pass

286
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:57,960
so uh there was that but then the other game that i spent a bit of time playing uh was one of those

287
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:03,080
games where people have been telling me for like years you need to play this game and i don't know

288
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,160
why i resisted i guess maybe like watching the early trailers and stuff i was like i don't really

289
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:12,680
know if that's for me or i didn't like i had the first game on 360 and i don't really remember

290
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:18,200
playing a lot of it and now that i've played a good like 90 minutes or so of it i i fear i

291
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,400
may have made the same mistake that i made with the mass effect series the first time i played it

292
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,240
because and if you don't know what i'm talking about the first time i played mass effect

293
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,640
i thought i was like i don't get it but then i went back years later and played it and i was like

294
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:39,320
i am obsessed.com and i played the entire trilogy so what game was it that i finally played this

295
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:49,800
week near automata oh my god it's so fun it's like i i'm like oh it's so good like uh i played

296
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:55,080
through like that whole like intro level the only like frustrating thing was that you can't save in

297
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,160
that whole opening like you go through like an hour long opening and you can't freaking save

298
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,560
at all that was the only annoying thing but otherwise i i kind of didn't realize it's like

299
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,640
okay it's like an actiony kind of game like you're playing something like i don't know like maybe

300
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:14,600
like bayonetta i mean another platinum game i guess um but you're kind of playing a shooter game

301
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:20,360
at the same time it depends what difficulty level you're playing on if you play on bobby blackwolf

302
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:25,560
mode or easy mode then the shooter stuff i think is i i'm playing on normal but i believe i read

303
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,640
that on the easy mode the shooter stuff is kind of all done for you so you can just focus on button

304
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,640
mashing the um melee combat stuff but i'm playing on normal mode where you kind of have to do both

305
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:39,960
at once and it's it's really confusing at first but it's like really really fun so um yeah it's

306
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,880
and they just put it on game pass this past week so that's why i finally jumped in i was like oh

307
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:49,080
i should just play this already um hey rob yeah what if i can interject real quick demons till

308
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:55,240
just 13.99 on switch right now oh that's not bad that's not bad i mean i pay for xbox game pass

309
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,640
so it's free but not really free because i'm paying for xbox game pass so it's you know that

310
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:05,000
whole thing but if you have 20 on steam oh oh so it's a little cheaper on switch well that's good

311
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,080
cool um so yeah near i i definitely want to go back and play more so i can get further into the

312
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,000
game and tell you if there's like even more about it that i like um because now i feel like i kind

313
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,840
of hit like i feel like i played through all the prologue stuff and i was doing some of the stuff

314
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,080
around the ship and then i kind of like ran out of time um but i want to go back and do more and

315
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:29,400
see if like the later levels are as fun as that first one was um and i think finally like because

316
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,440
they have that raid in final fantasy 14 uh it has a really you know it's a really cool ambience and

317
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:40,040
the music in final fantasy 14 is incredible and like i didn't really realize they kind of lifted

318
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:45,720
stuff directly from the game i mean it's a little different but like the game's soundtrack is fucking

319
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:53,480
great like it's oh it's good so yeah uh my bad you all told me for a long time i needed to play it

320
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:59,560
finally got around to it you all were right what can i say finally played it so uh and i will be

321
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:03,640
playing more of it later on so it's near automata finally all these years later so playing the xbox

322
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:08,200
version which i guess is the i don't know if it's the definitive edition but it's like the most

323
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:14,200
recent one they put out so it has like all the extra stuff in it i think so playing that one uh

324
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,520
all right so there it is that's my gaming week so um don't really have a lot else to say here at the

325
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,760
top of the show i think we ought to just jump right into some gaming news so loki what's going

326
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:29,400
on in the gaming world this week all right so let's talk about rumors and speculation of course

327
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:39,320
um so there is the whole anniversary of mario coming up here pretty soon the 35 year anniversary

328
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:46,360
and the rumor is that nintendo is playing on remastering some of the 3d mario games to put

329
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:53,000
into a collection kind of like a new um mario all-stars type game so the thought is that there's

330
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:01,000
going to be remasters of the mario 64 the galaxy games uh sunshine that type of stuff as long as

331
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,480
um as well as there's going to be some information about super nintendo world and of course the

332
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:16,200
upcoming animated super mario movie that's being worked on um as well so apparently the thought

333
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:21,400
that the reveal is supposed to happen around e3 um but now it's gonna be rolled into maybe a

334
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:27,720
different trade show or maybe part of this digital event they're gonna do and usually you know i'm

335
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,600
i'm iffy on bringing up rumors here on the program it's obviously not the first time we've done it

336
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,920
but this is one of those rumors that's kind of coming from multiple places right like it's it's

337
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:42,040
not just like my uncle who works at nintendo told me this is happening like this is coming from

338
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:48,680
places that are right in historically and it's like several outlets are kind of cross-verifying

339
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:55,320
this information so it's it's a high pro on the plausibility scale it's pretty high right

340
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:00,840
um i think it's pretty reasonable that they would do something like this it seems like easy enough

341
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:06,360
to remaster some of these older games especially since they've kind of have remastered like some

342
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:15,080
of the galaxy games and stuff because they were running them on um the nvidia shield in china oh

343
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:20,200
that's right no you're right they did make those games on on the shield so so technically i mean

344
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,480
that's pretty i mean it's shield hardware is pretty similar to the nintendo switch already

345
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:32,120
so the work's been kind of already done um so i mean it's pretty plausible it's gonna happen in

346
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:36,920
more announcements regarding super nintendo world i mean that makes sense since they're already

347
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,960
working on it and we already know that the mario movie is coming it would be cool if we had a

348
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:47,160
trailer or something uh but i don't think i don't remember when that slated to come out that might

349
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:53,080
be 2021 or 2022 uh but yeah it'd be interesting to hear something about it i believe the mario

350
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,160
movie was supposed to be like holiday 2021 or something like that so you know maybe a trailer

351
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:01,240
or first look would make a lot of sense so we kind of get the idea like what does it look like is it

352
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,320
like a cartoon or is it like a and it's probably not it's probably gonna look like despicable me

353
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:11,000
that type of animation yeah oh i don't think i mean well not like you know what i mean like that

354
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,040
style of like pixar-ish type of art yeah it's not like the whole thing is gonna look like despicable

355
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:21,960
me but you know it's that same studio so it's that type of art yeah yeah um illumination is

356
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:28,920
like great stuff so i wouldn't be any surprise if it's gonna be great well and the mario uh world

357
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:35,320
was supposed to open in japan in time for the tokyo olympics and i don't know if they had

358
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,320
ended up ultimately pushing the opening back a little bit or if it was going to make it but we

359
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:44,200
saw some of those construction pictures out there it would have made a lot of sense that like early

360
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:51,400
june would have been a great time frame to get a first look at the mario park if it was going to

361
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:57,240
open soon for the tokyo olympics obviously the global pandemic has fucked up all of these

362
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:04,840
timelines so nothing is certain anymore but i mean it's it would seem like early june would

363
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:09,560
have been about the right time to hear more about the park and probably those sorts of things were

364
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:15,000
already in motion as far as getting the footage concept putting that stuff together before the

365
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,520
pandemic really hit so we could still still see some of that come out in june it just might be

366
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,040
the timetable of when this actually opens could really be up in the air

367
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:31,480
i suppose yeah i mean it'd be interesting to see uh i would like some more details of what's going

368
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:36,920
to be at the park because i'm very excited to go see that yeah i remember seeing some of the the

369
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:42,360
video shots that they had showing like those moving platforms and stuff um i mean it's looking

370
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,840
very much like their concept that they had in there so i'm very curious to see what kind of

371
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,920
rides and everything because i mean honestly once that stuff opens up especially over here in the

372
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:57,320
united states i'm down to go to go vacation there so we'll have to see uh sg100 matt with an

373
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:01,720
excellent point in chat saying theme parks are in big trouble so it's really up in the air yeah i

374
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,880
mean we don't know what it's going to look like on the other side of this you know we don't know

375
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,280
if theme parks are going to be able to reopen right away and i suppose just a lot of that

376
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,880
really depends on the science behind this thing you know can they test to see if people have it

377
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:21,640
really fast you know can they do more things to slow the spread down and so forth i mean a lot of

378
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:27,800
these factors are going to dictate if theme parks can open up really fast or not um because i i mean

379
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:34,120
again i am not a scientist or a doctor but i could see a situation where like small businesses open

380
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:40,760
up again and you can still kind of have small gatherings but they frown on the big stuff for a

381
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:47,880
few more months i mean again i have you that's just me you know being a fortune teller i have

382
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,600
no idea to listen to the people that are doctors and scientists and what they have to say but i

383
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,880
could just kind of see that that's like a logical progression that this sorts of thing is like

384
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:00,760
easier to track in smaller groups than it would be you know thousands of people at a theme park

385
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:08,360
type of thing so i don't know anyway um yeah and phoenix uh in chat is asking is it going to end

386
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:13,480
up being seasonal is another important question that's a hugely important question and you know

387
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:19,320
can we develop uh you know again the the rapid testing can we develop an immunity can we develop

388
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,120
a vaccine like we can do for the flu you know so much is dependent although all those things we

389
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:29,160
don't have an answer for yet but we know the world is working on it um and from a technical angle

390
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,880
you know that folding at home that we talked about a few weeks ago has never seen the type of action

391
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:38,840
that has been seen because everybody wants to help do something about all the bitcoin miners

392
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:45,080
are taking their resources and moving them more appropriately to be working on um this instead

393
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:49,160
maybe that's why cooking mama on the switch is it's actually where you know i'm just okay that's

394
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:52,040
that's a whole other thing i wasn't going to bring up because we don't know what the hell's going on

395
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,960
cooking mom on the switch but i'm sure you've seen some of the rumors going on out there so yeah

396
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:01,320
anyway but anyway uh so we just don't know there's still a lot of things that are going to find out

397
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,960
in the weeks and weeks and weeks ahead so uh we will see uh anyway going back to the

398
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:10,360
mario story for a minute uh what about these mario games that they're saying could be part

399
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:16,920
of the uh remaster i i think the mario sunshine and mario galaxy games really do seem like good

400
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,880
candidates to come back because especially mario sunshine i think was really under appreciated the

401
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,080
first time when it was out on the gamecube but i feel like it was one of those things like

402
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,600
a lot of people that played it still really loved it for its unique kind of water mechanic

403
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,760
and then you know bringing back mario 64 is kind of just like that sure thing you know especially

404
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:39,160
if they if they kind of up res it and make it look even better if they're gonna like truly remaster

405
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,560
it uh i think that has the potential to do very well because you know that's a lot of people's

406
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,400
all-time favorite mario game what do you think about specifically the games that they're choosing

407
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:54,920
loki or dark soccer well i don't think they've really announced yet what games they're gonna

408
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:00,600
choose i mean it's all kind of speculated right now um i don't know i it's been a while since i

409
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,440
played galaxy i would love to go back to play those because they were apparently really great

410
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,560
games which i had not you know wish i'd actually finished them i hear also that the rumor is

411
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:14,360
supposed to be that they're going to be announcing a new paper mario game and honestly i mean i

412
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:19,000
haven't been able to get into a lot of paper mario games but super paper mario that was on the wii

413
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,600
was fantastic and i love that yeah the wii one was really good how about how about super mario

414
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:29,480
rpg how about that although essentially i think that's kind of what paper mario is

415
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,880
it's kind of like well we can't make mario rpg anymore because that's the square enix thing but

416
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,480
hey anything is possible in this crazy world you never know i'm gonna cross my fingers i'm

417
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:43,720
personally looking for famicom grand prix f1 race i mean just saying it was only out on the

418
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:49,640
disk system and you know hey mario racing another car it isn't you know mario kart you never know

419
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:55,000
dreams really do come true sometimes you never know i'm rooting for mario is missing hell yeah

420
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,000
let's bring entertainment back all right anyway uh let's move on and talk about um you know this

421
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,280
this news is one of those like it's not surprising although it still kind of sucks but you kind of

422
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:12,680
saw it coming and that is that the last of us part two has been delayed again with no new release

423
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:17,720
date set we don't know when it's coming out it's like gaga's album it's been put on hold until

424
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:23,240
she's ready until we know when this whole thing is going to be behind us and so on so i'm sure

425
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:28,840
that news does disappoint people but i are y'all really surprised so yeah the game was going to be

426
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:34,840
coming out on may 29th but uh they did confirm via a tweet um sie has made the difficult decision to

427
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:41,000
delay the launch of the last of us part two and actually marvel's iron man vr until further notice

428
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,720
logistically the global crisis is preventing us from providing the launch experience our players

429
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:51,080
deserve currently there are no other delays to report but we'll keep you updated and i'm sure

430
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:55,880
a lot of people are wondering well why don't they just do a digital release and da da da da

431
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:02,680
and i think the reality is those day one sales are so important that i think they want to make

432
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:09,080
sure they're engaging not just digital but they are engaging the people that want to get retail

433
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:15,640
or physical or the people whose habits are more i want to go to target i want to go to game stop

434
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:21,560
i want to go to wherever it is that i get games um to to buy this game in a physical condition

435
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:25,400
because maybe i live in a part of the country where the internet isn't as strong so i can't

436
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:30,600
exactly download a 70 gigabyte game or whatever this thing chalks in as and so those day one and

437
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:36,200
those launch number figures are so important where it's like whereas sony could do an all digital

438
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:41,560
launch is it in their best business sense to really do that and i think the reality is no

439
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:47,240
it's not and that's why they're putting it on hold until they can really do a strong worldwide launch

440
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:52,040
i mean kind of look what's happening at the final fantasy 7 remake fantasy 7 remake kind of came in

441
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:56,360
like it went gold at a really weird time where it was like okay they've hit the ground running on

442
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:00,680
getting the distribution going and then the pandemic happens because you know these things

443
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:05,960
don't just ship from the factory the night before this is a a couple months long process to get from

444
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,160
the gold master of the game to what you see out there and now the final fantasy 7 remake thing is

445
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:17,480
kind of messy i suppose although certainly not square i feel weird saying messy because it's

446
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:22,760
certainly not square enix's fault or sony's fault or anybody's fault it's just well some copies got

447
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,760
there early and they don't give a shit anymore because of what's going on some copies are going

448
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:32,040
to be there late and i got my email from amazon saying mine is coming late and although i'm a

449
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,800
little bit like ah bummer i'm like you know what though i completely understand getting

450
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,600
things out like gloves masks groceries and things that people actually need right now

451
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,680
is more important than final fantasy 7 remake and if it i'm really that bent up about it

452
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,680
then i guess i could do digital so i'm not like you know that bent out of shape about it but

453
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:53,320
the final fantasy 7 if you were bent out of shape about it you need to evaluate your priorities

454
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:57,720
exactly exactly so i'm like you know whatever you know if i have to wait a couple more days

455
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:02,840
whatever uh it's i'll probably still be on house arrest through the month of april anyway so i'll

456
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:07,400
get a chance to play it uh plenty well in fact actually yes we all know we're going to be here

457
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,720
till at least may 3rd for uh it was was that the governor's thing was may 3rd or was that just the

458
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:16,360
bay area and where the bay area goes sacramento quickly follows regardless as a matter we know

459
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:21,560
we're going to be here till may so um you know if it's a couple days late whatever i'll still

460
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:27,880
have plenty of time to play it um i just don't think that sony wants to launch these games

461
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:33,400
and have it be as all over the place they want this to still be a gaming event and maybe

462
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:40,840
something when people aren't focusing on all these other more important things and can go back to oh

463
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:46,360
i'm just doing a game it's a fun silly thing and maybe it also may just be viewed in poor taste

464
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:50,440
right now to be doing a zombie related game i don't know i mean that that could certainly be

465
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:55,000
weighing to it as well i don't i don't think that's a big deal but it could be for some people i don't

466
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,720
know so um phoenix in chat says i'm curious about whether the delay is covid related or quality

467
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:08,440
related either way a good idea i really do think it's covid related as as its core and probably

468
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:14,200
because the quality can't really be finished like i don't know about you guys but like i'm working

469
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:19,000
from home right now and i and i'm very fortunate to be able to do that i'm very very fortunate and

470
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,600
very thankful that my position is something that can do that but it is a slower process

471
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:29,320
and that's nothing to do with you know i i still am a good little worker bee but it's that you know

472
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:35,080
sometimes the connection to the server is slower uh things working on a laptop is just not as fancy

473
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:39,240
as when i'm working on my dual monitor setup back at the office there's just things about it that

474
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,480
are inherently slower and the reason why i say that is that you've got all these sony employees

475
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:48,520
and so forth that are also working from home right now and so probably the quality process

476
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:53,640
is moving slower you know just and even just a little bit can kind of back up the whole system

477
00:42:53,640 --> 00:43:01,000
if you know what i mean so there is that to be uh uh put in perspective um and phoenix and chat

478
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,160
also says rob what do you think about them charging full price for a quarter of a game

479
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:09,240
um it's not going to be a quarter of a game for i'm assuming that's about fall 97 remake

480
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,000
it's not a quarter of a game from what i understand and apparently a new trailer released

481
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,760
this week really shows that they are doing some things that should not have been part of the mid

482
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:26,600
gar story so they're clearly and i i've read one thing i hear there's other spoilers i'm trying to

483
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:31,160
keep myself pure on it i will probably get spoiled because people are dicks on twitter

484
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:37,720
but i'm gonna try to go in it as pure as i can um and i know i was super surprised by seeing that

485
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:46,280
i'm glad you uh cut out there all right so anyway yeah um so i i don't think it's really going to be

486
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:51,400
a quarter of the game like it's not and even if you play the demo again i i kind of use that as

487
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:57,720
my there's things in that demo that weren't in the original game so they're they're whatever

488
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:02,920
what i was trying to say as really surprised in that latest trailer that you know erith decided

489
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:10,280
to put on the impenetrable vest that's you know no blade can pierce through so i'm really really

490
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:15,880
curious to see how this is going to change this yes somebody gifted her a bulletproof vest for

491
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,240
no particular reason and we'll see how that changes thing i'm a time traveler for the future

492
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:26,040
here take this anyway and don't go to 2020 all right anyway uh so there those games have been

493
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:31,640
delayed so we will hear when they get rescheduled when sony is ready to unveil it i would anticipate

494
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:37,560
don't expect to hear a new date until people are back at work when people are back at work across

495
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:43,640
the country then you'll hear a new date but not before so moving on dark sakura

496
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:52,760
i forgot where i had myself muted so um you know we had talked about amazon's whole gaming deal

497
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,640
before and it looks like they've actually released some information about some titles that are going

498
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:04,440
to be coming out their first original big budget stuff coming out in may one of them is a sci-fi

499
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:10,520
third-person shooter called crucible um been in development for a while i mean the description

500
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:18,600
is pretty you know out there you know very vague um you it's survival and control fighting with

501
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:25,800
fellow competitors it doesn't really so it looks like it's a team versus game so you know kind of

502
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:32,840
maybe overwatch-ish from what it sounds like um or like you know fortnite something like that

503
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:39,320
and it's supposed to be uh released in uh in may and then another one in may is an mmo called new

504
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:47,240
world that has been described as a tolkanesque reimagining of 17th century british america

505
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:56,360
um so basically it's you know colonialism and fantasy i guess kind of weird um i don't know

506
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:02,760
that i'm too happy about that as a theme because i mean well we all know how great colonialism

507
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:10,360
worked for native populations so just saying kind of not very well of them to do that as a theme

508
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,880
let's see what they let's see where it goes like you know we don't we don't know what the story

509
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:19,240
really looks like yet it better be void of other humans for me to enjoy it yeah well if they're

510
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:23,960
going to bring in like magic and fire and things like that then clearly it's not set in a realistic

511
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:29,560
world anyway so which is probably for the best um well i mean as long as it i don't know i'm

512
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:34,680
uncomfortable with the with the concept of a game that requires overtaking you know an indigenous

513
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:43,400
population but that's me um anyway yeah there there's us oh another uh cloud-based uh gaming

514
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:51,160
service that amazon is developing called project tempo and working um on titles that twitch

515
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:58,200
broadcasters can play with viewers in real time so uh we'll see what that is i guess it's supposed

516
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:04,040
to compete with stadia oh that could be interesting i mean the cloud cloud yeah

517
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:13,000
so who knows all right well we'll we'll see i guess uh amazon will still uh bring uh pull back

518
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,120
the curtain on this a little bit uh in the next month uh in may they can stop being shitty with

519
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:25,080
the rest of their practices all right let's move on to uh a game i think we've all confessed that

520
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:33,560
we've been playing recently right logi um correct so pokemon go is making some changes to uh their

521
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:42,840
game to you know kind of address the having to stay at home and quarantined situations so of

522
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:48,280
course you know they've done this in other games like uh minecraft earth had a thing where you can

523
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:53,160
actually bring some of those adventures to yourself now they're going to be doing something similar

524
00:47:53,160 --> 00:48:00,120
where you can take on raid battles um from the comfort of your own home with friends so that's

525
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:06,280
pretty cool they'll be able to raid it from home um no word exactly when that's supposed to go into

526
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:14,120
effect 100 but i'd imagine pretty soon so yeah that's got to be a huge change they're making to

527
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:19,000
the back end of it so that's uh it's kind of surprising they're going to go that far with it

528
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,760
so it's uh interesting for sure and you know um uh there are other games i i have not played

529
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:29,080
harry potter in quite some time so i couldn't tell you what's going on in that game um but i

530
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,600
have still been playing ingress a little bit and it's been interesting to see kind of the changes

531
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:37,880
they've been making there where um they really emphasize recharging which is something you can

532
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:43,640
do from your couch they bumped it up so you get like six times the ap or experience if you will

533
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:48,680
from like recharging that you used to get um so that's kind of interesting and then you're uh

534
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:54,200
streak badge for like there's like a badge for oh you hacked uh portals 60 days in a row or

535
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,960
whatever you can get all that from recharging now so it's interesting how they've kind of made that

536
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:03,960
the emphasis um lately but i've still been going out to ingress like once in a great while like

537
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:10,200
last saturday i went to a cemetery because there's a ton of portals there and it's a really easy place

538
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:14,920
to be socially distant from other people uh and just kind of you know messed around in ingress and

539
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:20,040
it's it was a nice little like take my mind off everything else for a little while type of thing

540
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:26,200
so oh yeah and as that brings up they brought a new uh uh double boost item as well that's right

541
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,200
i forgot about that they uh that is out as well so you can get some free ones in the shop right now

542
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:36,120
uh phoenix says are all the parks closed up there rob i know they closed them in oregon

543
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:42,840
um like city parks and like parks in the neighborhood no but i think like major one i

544
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,920
don't even think they've closed the river parks as far as i know because you know sacramento where

545
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:51,160
we're based is the river city as far as i know they haven't shut that stuff down yet i think

546
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:55,320
they've kind of said we're keeping our eye on it and everybody's been pretty well behaved so far so

547
00:49:55,320 --> 00:50:01,080
we're not going to shut it down yet um but i think if you try to go to any state parks and certainly

548
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:06,440
like if i were to go to the coast uh that's closed down and i know they put out an advisory that said

549
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:11,800
don't go to south lake tahoe like the people up there were like don't come here stay home you

550
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,520
know so they're those types of more like touristy park things i think they are trying to discourage

551
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:22,680
people from going to so but um i do know even at the parks around here the play structures

552
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:26,920
they've put a bunch of caution tape around or they've like roped it off so that kids can't play

553
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:33,240
on them um because they don't want the surface you know um especially because most kids don't

554
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:37,640
exhibit systems symptoms yes i know there are certainly some very sad exceptions we've heard

555
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:42,680
about in the news most kids don't exhibit systems so they don't want them all over the play

556
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:46,920
structure kind of like spreading it from family to family that way which seems like a smart thing to

557
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:53,560
do so yeah or as that says in chat cootie factories pretty much so yeah i did see that they did

558
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:59,400
surround those because and from what i've seen too even just like going to the park just to kind of

559
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:03,640
walk around or whatever um there's like tons of kids still playing on the parks and stuff

560
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:08,920
so they they they wrap those all up now with caution tape so that it prevents people from

561
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:14,280
doing that yep and they did a similar thing in this neighborhood as well so not surprised

562
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:19,080
yeah well anyhow um just to my next story was kind of about the twitch gaming thing which i

563
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:22,680
didn't realize was going to be part of what dark soccer had already hit on but there's a little

564
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:27,080
extra detail in this to talk about those games that are being um developed for twitch because

565
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:31,480
right now most things as a viewer you're acting a little bit more passively like when somebody's

566
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:36,040
playing marbles on stream you're not really like in there playing the game with them and then

567
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:39,800
i also kind of have heard jackbox party pack using that example but i don't know i feel like

568
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,800
a jackbox party pack you kind of are in there playing the game with somebody else i mean maybe

569
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:48,760
the massively ones like you're just in the audience but i would say i know a lot of people

570
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:55,080
that are using jackbox party pack like i feel like that game is doing more business and more success

571
00:51:55,080 --> 00:52:00,040
than anything else i know in gaming right now because a lot of like non-gamers are picking it

572
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:06,440
up and doing like zoom parties like my speaking oregon my cousins live up in oregon and um they

573
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:10,600
are doing they were doing a jackbox party pack thing on zoom the other night and i never i was

574
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,880
like you guys don't really play video games but that was the thing they were doing to keep in

575
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:18,920
touch with friends so uh that's uh you know obviously been a huge thing anyhow though um

576
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:23,080
amazon did mention in an interview with the new york times that they are developing games

577
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:28,840
that streamers and viewers will play together in real time which is interesting because twitch has

578
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:33,400
always taken a lot of shit about that lag although if you are which i actually don't

579
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:38,200
think is a big deal at all but then again we come from an era of shoutcast where there was

580
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:45,320
always a lag anyway so i'm used to it um but and i believe if you are a um partner you have and i

581
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:49,960
may be wrong and maybe bleeding some things with mixer but i believe you have access to like a very

582
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:57,080
fast uh bandwidth type of thing where the lag is lessened but if there's a new excuse me sorry

583
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:05,960
cough um i believe there's a new um um i lost my train of thought there's a new um technology

584
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:10,520
there yeah and bobby says in chat the lag is now only like three or four seconds oh affiliates get

585
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,760
low latency mode as well we actually have it turned on with vog oh i didn't even realize i

586
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:19,400
thought there was still a bit of the delay but even a three or four second delay you can't play

587
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:24,120
games on you can't live like an action game you play jackbox you can't really play like an action

588
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:29,640
game so hopefully uh you know with this cloud gaming and some of these other things that we're

589
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:33,880
hearing about that are you know because google stadia one thing that it does do very impressively

590
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:38,600
and when i've talked about google stadia i've mentioned it it does respond very well it is like

591
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:43,400
you're playing a youtube live so if they're kind of able to have some of that same technology when

592
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:48,120
it comes to playing with other people on twitch that could be very interesting um they are saying

593
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:52,040
games should be available throughout the summer it's not like this will be the first time that

594
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:57,080
twitch has had their own games uh twitch sings was a thing although obviously or is a thing

595
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:01,560
although obviously uh that's a little different because that's not something that viewers

596
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:06,280
play with the streamer all the time and so forth um so yeah they're saying they're going to keep

597
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,840
viewers engaged and interested enough to keep coming back and supposedly the thing that twitch

598
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:16,680
wants to have an edge over their competition mixer and youtube and so forth so we'll see where that

599
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:22,280
goes uh very interested to see what kind of games and so forth they come up with on that all right

600
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:31,480
let's move on dark sakura so um i i i'm going to go ahead and preface this story saying that it's

601
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:37,240
focusing a little bit too much on violent games when they're talking about addiction so i'm just

602
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:43,000
going to dive right into it um so there is a study published called computers in human behavior

603
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:49,720
that suggesting that playing violent video games in particular can impair anger detection and it

604
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:55,880
also will enhance a feeling of fighting abilities to make you overconfident in your response to how

605
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:02,360
you would uh think you could perform in a fight basically um and they're they're talking about

606
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:09,800
this bias that violent video games increases aggression and ultra social information processing

607
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:15,240
so they're going from that very flawed standpoint um but they're going a little bit more also into

608
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:19,480
pathological gaming but they're saying specifically that violent video games are leading to

609
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:25,320
pathological gaming which again is pretty flawed in general it's by uh thomas f denson who's a

610
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:31,320
psychology professor at the university of new south wales um where we've seen in other ways

611
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:35,320
that pathological gaming is like with any addiction it can be any kind of video game

612
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:42,200
um you know and it's it's defined as pathological gaming this is a quote occurs when people

613
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:46,920
prioritize playing violent video games he's saying violent i think it's others over facets other

614
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:51,720
facets of life even when doing so causes impairments relationships academic pursuits worker

615
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:59,560
mental health um but they did show a correlation and it's he did specify this as it's not perfectly

616
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:06,520
replicated but the general pattern shows that the violent video games in particular

617
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:13,800
um impair anger recognition and increase the self-perceived fighting ability and it also

618
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:20,280
is supposed he said it also lowers the perception of as and this is a quote again other men's

619
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:27,240
toughness um it was uh three experiments done with 868 participants are randomly assigned to

620
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:31,560
play either violent or non-violent games and then completing various assessments of social

621
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:37,640
cognition and threat perception so the first two they played the game for 15 minutes um on an xbox

622
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:42,760
360 connect i don't know what connect has to do with it because that's not really supported um

623
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:50,280
the third experiment um played internet browser games for five minutes and so with the non-violent

624
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:57,560
versus the violent the um the violent ones tended to be worse at recognizing an angry facial

625
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:04,680
expression and uh were less willing to back out of a hypothetical physical confrontation

626
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:11,880
um and i thought that they'd be able to take take whoever it was in a fight um i again the the the

627
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:17,080
experiment to me just sounds very flawed i went you know i wonder if they did the same thing

628
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:21,400
um you know with say watching a movie or something like that you know

629
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:27,560
again i think that this one went into the the research with a bias um and i'll go ahead and

630
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:32,680
just read this last quote from uh from the the paper this research extends to some other work

631
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:37,880
that we've done on why violent video games are so alluring in that study we found that people who

632
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:42,920
played a lot of violent video games also rated themselves as more of a good catch to members of

633
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:48,760
the opposite sex this is also running the gender binary which pisses me off and they also reported

634
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:55,240
a greater interest in sex um and it also says although those data record uh were correlational

635
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:59,960
they are consistent with our new findings that playing via video games may give people a boost in

636
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:05,960
confidence in both their mating and fighting abilities again flawed yeah well and it's the

637
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:11,240
fact that they used xbox 360 connect for one i can't think of what violent game unless it must

638
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:16,200
be one of those launch titles like the i i don't know there's got to be like some some stuff i'm

639
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,960
not thinking of in the moment like early but there wasn't a lot of like violent violent stuff on

640
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:24,600
xbox 360 connect and plus the huge flaw with that is that you're getting your physic if you're

641
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,400
playing connects you're getting your physicality up you're getting your heart rate up you're

642
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:31,000
getting your motion going versus an internet browser game where you're sitting there clicking

643
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,800
the mouse like that yeah why why aren't they considering the physical the heightened physical

644
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:41,400
senses that's i haven't read the whole study so i mean there could be possibly more in the study

645
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:49,560
but the the fact that this is number one focusing on a a gender binary you know which again is flawed

646
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:56,440
because that's not how people you know really work um there's also you know so many other factors to

647
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:01,880
consider like you were saying even just the physicality of using a connect game where what

648
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:08,120
happens if they're playing like a cutesy fighting game you know or say that they're watching a a

649
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:13,560
violent film or a scary film or say that they have them play a survival horror game you know

650
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:19,960
where where's the difference in there you know again flawed if we're gonna have this type of

651
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:25,400
research going then gamers with psychology degrees need to be on the freaking panel

652
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:29,880
or the fact that they're just being forced to play connect game might make them pretty angry

653
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:35,400
no that ain't me angry well no not if i was playing um dan central i'd be happy with that

654
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:40,600
because i missed that game but that game wasn't violent last i remembered maybe there maybe

655
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:44,280
there's a secret version i don't know about but yeah it's just someone's just really bad at it

656
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:49,800
i think i think you kind of hit your this sounds like it was a loaded thing and that's why you know

657
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:54,600
and again you know in full disclosure we're all saying we haven't really read it the finer details

658
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:59,640
but in reading this summary i think none of us want to because it just sounds like you you

659
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:04,520
really kind of misfired on a lot of different components of this like you go back to the

660
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:09,640
drawing board and start over number one you know get get some gamer experts on the panel get people

661
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:14,840
that you know no thing or two about games number two uh xbox 360 connect is not even a modern thing

662
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:21,160
anymore so modernize it up a little bit do some comparing with other forms of art i think you

663
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:25,160
made a good point when you said cutesy fighting games because you highlighted one it's the classic

664
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:31,400
game of the week well it wasn't a it was kind of a weird you know what i mean but it wasn't it wasn't

665
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:35,720
violent really you know all things are said and done you know there's some different controls here

666
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:41,320
that they're not even looking at that i think really kind of just like no this was ran to get

667
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:48,760
a certain result i don't know anyway um so bobby says fighter within fighter within is a oh god i do

668
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:53,000
remember that fighter within is a connect only fighting game that brings us motion fighting

669
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,760
where you'll be flailing your arms legs and doing other silly moves and hopes not only to beat up

670
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:00,520
your opponent but that the game will register what you're trying to accomplish by waving said

671
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:08,280
lips about so what about um they used a fighting game nobody's played crap now i can't think of the

672
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:15,640
of the name uh uh eternal champions with an activator well obviously well okay but just

673
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:21,000
looking at an activator makes me violent i'm just saying all right anyway so i think the study has

674
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,160
some problems an adventurous game as well too i don't know why they just didn't do that one that's

675
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:29,320
like a better option i know just play mortal combat 11 for god's sake if you want to test a

676
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:34,200
violent game use one of the most violent ones of all but you know it's it's more modern and it's

677
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:40,120
not you get you can sit there with a controller you're not getting your body and your heart rate

678
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:45,400
up and all that as well like i that that is the most flawed thing like and i'm no scientist or

679
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:50,760
it but i'm like even an idiot can tell you in one scenario you're also you're not really comparing

680
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:56,520
just this to this because the heart rate's going up the physicalness is going up it's it all this

681
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:01,400
other stuff is is is heightened and so you're not really like it's not you're supposed to have a

682
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:05,480
control because the control isolates the one thing you're trying to review and that's not

683
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:11,400
what's happening here at all so anyway just my thoughts on it anyway um let's move on

684
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:15,080
and talk about oh something else that might make you want to fight i don't know loki

685
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:29,560
all right well um yes so unfortunately we got news from um gearbox about some gearbox employees

686
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:36,040
about some um royalty checks that weren't going to be as high as they'd expected so

687
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:42,360
what i've been typical of gearbox employees is that they aren't paid as high as some of the

688
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:49,160
industry um employees in that same position but the way they offset it is they're paid i guess

689
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:56,520
a 60 40 royalty split between the company and the employees themselves so they get 40 percent of

690
01:02:56,520 --> 01:03:02,200
that um what has happened or at least been revealed is that because of the fact the

691
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:09,080
development costs on borderline 3 despite the game being incredibly successful were high because you

692
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:16,440
know the game took long to develop and also the conversion from unreal 3 to unreal 4 it cost 95

693
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:23,640
million to develop the game and apparently over 100 million to develop the dlc for that and because

694
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:27,720
of that the resulting checks that they were supposed to receive which these are supposed

695
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:33,720
to be much higher than they were previously um aren't the case anymore so it seems that

696
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:41,160
with this happening they're still being underpaid in general across the board now i'm not sure that's

697
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:46,200
going to increase as time goes on i'm not sure the frequency is of these royalty checks but it

698
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:51,240
still sucks that they're in that position in the first place especially with um coming out of the

699
01:03:51,240 --> 01:04:02,040
lawsuit that um they have as well for uh gearbox and everything with randy pitchford it was revealed

700
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:08,440
that he took a 12 million dollar bonus in 2016 um granted that would have been from the 60 percent

701
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:13,800
that the company gets not the 40 percent but in fact that he takes 12 million dollar bonus

702
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:19,960
when they're getting undercut kind of sucks hold up hold up that guy loki that guy point i'm

703
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:25,560
pointing at the poster in the studio that guy yes yes the guy that signed that poster maybe i'm just

704
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:28,360
gonna take that i think i'm gonna take this down for a little while i'm just gonna take it down

705
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:34,360
for a little while all right so anyways yeah so apparently yeah he took his bonus and of course

706
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:40,600
they're all getting underpaid um and then he had some kind words to tell his uh developers if they

707
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:45,240
were unhappy with it basically saying that hey if you're not happy with the royalty system you're

708
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:55,320
welcome to quit so um yeah that's unfortunate but um apparently they've been gearbox has been

709
01:04:55,320 --> 01:05:00,200
looking to go public at some point so it'd be interesting to see how that plays in the things

710
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:06,360
but um it's not a good look and especially with a lot of controversy surrounding randy uh pitchford

711
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:11,240
even before the game came out uh it's just it's not not a good look for them no it's not a good

712
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:14,680
look when you're taking 12 million dollars and then telling everybody else to go without that's

713
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:21,080
that's really really not a good look so uh i think we're gonna retire randy from the studio

714
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,200
for a little while i think that would be the i think that would be the best idea uh esta

715
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:28,440
200 mountain chat says shame on gearbox for this then again they did promise these six figure

716
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:33,560
royalties in writing when they signed on if so then they have a case well and it's just it's

717
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:38,520
just tacky when the person at the top is getting the most money and the people on the bottom are

718
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:44,280
getting no i mean it would be one thing if it was like i'm taking the pay cut too or i am taking

719
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:49,400
some of this money as as you've seen some like like guy fieri with all the shit this he's taken

720
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:53,240
over the years hey at least he's kind of like taking some of his own money and trying to like

721
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:57,000
put that back into the frontline restaurant workers and all that stuff like it would be

722
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:01,080
a little bit of a different story if something like that was going on but unfortunately it does

723
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:07,400
not appear to be so anyhow all right well thank you for sharing with that us with uh thank you

724
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:12,920
for sharing that with us nonetheless um maybe do you think it would have made more if they hadn't

725
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:18,200
done that whole exclusive to epic thing like where where's the payola from that going i think

726
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:23,240
it's fine i mean because if anything that would have probably been less because i think they got

727
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:31,320
some sort of discounts for using a reel on their own platform um i just think that it you know it's

728
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:35,320
the cost of making the game but i still think they should take care of their employees as well

729
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:40,680
uh it just unfortunately they've had a lot of flops lately with you know both aliens,

730
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:47,080
clone and lorraine's and uh their looters i can't remember the other game that they had

731
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:53,080
so they had battleborn was their other their hero shooter that didn't really take off um

732
01:06:54,280 --> 01:07:01,160
i just think yeah it kind of sucks that this is what happened but i'm hoping that maybe

733
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:08,680
with future success you know with the game that maybe they'll get paid better but i guess you know

734
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:15,560
you're in that position now where um you know maybe if opportunities arise you know in the

735
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:20,600
future or maybe they don't stay at the company very long but unfortunately i think a lot of

736
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:25,960
times in this industry that they don't really have the luxury of being able to choose going

737
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:30,360
choose to go to other companies because it seems like everybody is treating their employees poorly

738
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:35,960
in one way or the other well and right now things are kind of stuck you know like now is not the

739
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:39,160
time i think a lot of people want you know with everything that's going on in the world it's not

740
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:43,880
a great time i'm not saying you can't or you know so forth and um you know certainly in other

741
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:46,600
industry i'm talking about specifically about like gaming and tech types of things i think most

742
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,320
people are trying to like stay where they're at type of thing i don't think there's a lot of moving

743
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:56,040
and shaking going on in that regard so i mean yeah but after that who knows and i think there

744
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:59,560
are a lot of tech companies people are really happy to work for like i have some friends in

745
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:04,360
the industry and i i don't want to name it because i don't have permission to even though it's a good

746
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:07,640
thing it's just a tacky thing to do because i want my friends to be able to trust that i can

747
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:12,600
separate personal life from the show um but i have friends that work in gaming that absolutely love

748
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:18,600
where they're at and love their companies um and you know uh wouldn't think to you know but but i

749
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:22,840
i'm not hearing these types of stories about those companies either you know what i mean

750
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:29,720
true that that's awesome yeah definitely true and and i think you know different with even

751
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:35,320
leading up to the release of warlands 3 it was just always about randy pitchford doing weird

752
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:41,160
things whether it's leaving a jump drive in a strip club or something like it was like a jump

753
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:50,040
drive with like pornography on it and company you know personal company information it's just or you

754
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:56,200
know punching you know his what was it like getting into a fight with one of his colleagues or

755
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:03,320
just getting into a lawsuit it's just ridiculous all the stuff before the game came out all right

756
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:07,800
well let's move on and try to get to um some more hopeful news here before we get to the

757
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:13,240
classic game or pinball game of the month uh and that is a story about another humble bundle that's

758
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:17,320
out and i know you know humble bundle kind of became its own store so i think the news

759
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:21,400
the notoriety about different like charity bundles and humble bundles i think we haven't heard as much

760
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:27,480
of that uh in like uh the at the top of gaming like remember when these guys first started like

761
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:33,080
every bundle they did um would be a notable thing and that kind of died off a little bit when humble

762
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:37,080
kind of started you know becoming their own store in their own company and so forth but this one

763
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:41,720
is a pretty big one that's getting news headlines again and i think you'll understand why

764
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:48,200
it's the covet 19 humble bundle and it's it's a really pretty impressive bundle that they put

765
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:53,080
together there uh they're saying it is a thousand dollars worth of games and comics that they are

766
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:59,080
putting together for just thirty dollars or more but the 30 is the minimum to get everything

767
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:03,720
but if you want to contribute more you certainly can and all of the money is going to different

768
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:10,840
coronavirus outbreak organizations um and again you can kind of um mix and match how what charities

769
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:16,360
you want to support out of the four uh and so forth which um oh i don't have the names of the

770
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:20,520
charities right in front of me uh i'm loading that up right now let me mention some of the

771
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:26,680
games though that are in the bundle into the breach the witness super hot broken age undertale

772
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:33,320
psycho not psych psychonauts excuse me um and uh yeah so there's there's a lot of you know and

773
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:38,440
again these are indie titles that were probably big in the last like three four years but still

774
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:43,400
i mean this is a great collection of things you might have missed and it's pretty hard to say like

775
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:47,480
oh these games should have been better when it's going for a good cause because it's really about

776
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:53,000
the cause it's not about um you know all the games that you're getting so the charities are direct

777
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:59,240
relief international rescue committee doctors without borders and partners in health so um

778
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:05,000
i just when i donated i just split my money evenly between them all but some people might um you know

779
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,240
kind of mix and match a little bit um another one that's very interesting uh that's in there

780
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:14,040
music maker edm edition because that was uh another like utility file that i picked up and

781
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:17,800
i was interested in that one so and some of them are run it starting to run a little low if you

782
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:24,840
want zombotron uh they're down to less than 25 000 keys on that so um something to consider there

783
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:30,440
anyhow at least it's for a good cause and it's nice to see the gaming world come together

784
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:36,040
and uh sell their old games again for good causes so yeah i picked it up as well i just want to make

785
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:41,400
sure i didn't most of the keys i did have quite a few there's a lot of games that i own that i

786
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:48,360
didn't realize i was like oh yeah it's like you already have this i'm like i do yeah i had a few

787
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:53,960
of them like a win uh pac-man championship edition 2 is in there i was like oh uh i love i i already

788
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,400
have that game on switch and everything so i'm like oh i'll get that on sale and i was like oh

789
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:02,040
i guess i already had this on steam and i forgot but i still i bought it anyway just because i want

790
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:06,200
to support the cause you know and uh i i think uh there's there's enough stuff in there that'll

791
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:10,040
keep me busy uh the music maker thing too was kind of new for me so i was like oh i'll check

792
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:14,680
that out i want to i want to look at that so yeah really fun yeah for sure all right well let's take

793
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:19,640
a trip back down memory lane we're going to revisit some simpler times uh and dark soccer

794
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:23,560
likes to step into the gaming vault every week and pick a game that she thinks hey you guys should

795
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:28,760
check this out but in a yearly an annual twist once a month she does something a little different

796
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:34,040
and this time uh in the year 2020 she's highlighting classic pinball tables of i think

797
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:40,920
the late 80s and early 90s so uh dark and dark sakura what did you pick for the classic pinball

798
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:47,080
table of the month another one that i own um i picked black rose which is another of my favorite

799
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:53,480
awesome so black sorry the twitch uh twitch video coming in a moment here sorry guys i made a boo boo

800
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:58,600
on my end okay sorry go ahead and talk though we'll get the video up here shortly all right

801
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:08,440
well um black rose is a lady pirate themed game um it was designed by john trudeau and uh brian eddie

802
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:17,160
and it was produced by uh midway as bally and so um its slogan is this game is loaded and so uh

803
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:28,920
you use uh you know uh basically you're doing a pirate fight um so uh it uh actually had um

804
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:36,840
for uh the uk release there was supposed to be some x-rated artwork for the back glass

805
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:42,200
um but it was never produced and they also considered using black pinballs

806
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:50,840
as cannonballs but they abandoned that idea um so the game uh was manufactured in july of 1992

807
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:59,080
as i said by uh midway uh as a subsidiary of williams uh under bally um it uh it was using

808
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:11,000
the williams wpc electronics 2 um and uh there were 3746 units confirmed sold um and so as far

809
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:17,480
as its features it has three flippers three pop bumpers three ramps uh three bank stand-up targets

810
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:24,280
uh two or three multi-ball the left ramp is mechanically raised or lowered with a ramp um

811
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:30,120
to use the ball cannon lower playfield has below the playfield ball cannon a catapult type that

812
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:36,120
oscillates when it's load so basically what this is is that you have this one ramp in the center

813
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:43,080
and it moves side to side and you have to line it up where uh you want to basically shoot the

814
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:50,440
cannonball um and so you fire when you press the fire button on this lockdown bar um it has the

815
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:57,800
the broadside so it will kick the ball to the center of this rail um so we'll set it back to

816
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:04,520
the flippers that way um the art for the table was done by pat uh pat mcman who has done i mean quite

817
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:11,960
a decent bit of uh of various pinball art you know uh he did things like uh trying to think

818
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:18,680
of what people are seeing roller games um he did tales of the arabian knights uh he did baby pac-man

819
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:27,400
dirty harry dungeon dragons fish tales so he's done some big titles mr and mrs pac-man pinball

820
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:32,920
i'm gonna have to find that one day um i was just looking at other artwork that he did but now um

821
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:38,280
one of the things that i'm going to bring into this is a little bit of some crazy notoriety

822
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:46,280
about one of the designers john trudeau um basically he got busted for child porn

823
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:55,240
that's a yike yeah now let me tell you what else he designed that rob the machine bride of pinbot

824
01:15:56,040 --> 01:16:03,320
creature from the black lagoon uh judge dread i actually we actually owned judge dread and

825
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:09,800
creature from the black lagoon he did congo um and he had started working for stern in uh 19

826
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:15,560
sorry in 2013 and he had some tables all set up but yeah he was arrested and charged for

827
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:19,720
a possession of child pornography he might have done some cool stuff but what an asshole

828
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:28,680
now here's a little bit more about it is that he actually was um uh that he did plead guilty

829
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:36,360
to those and they had also gotten him on um abuse of a criminal sexual abuse of a female family member

830
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:46,840
um so yeah garbage absolute garbage um so you know i want to point out there that um

831
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:52,920
the uh you know we can have fun with with our tables we can enjoy our fandom but we need to

832
01:16:52,920 --> 01:17:00,760
also be aware that you know if you're gonna say oh i love this designer know about the people

833
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:06,120
your favorites are problematic so yeah he's done some great tables i mean creature is dan's favorite

834
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:12,600
um but again you know be aware of the people who uh be aware of the entertainment you consume

835
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:22,280
hello for sure no yes you're still good sorry i'm i'm working on some other projects while

836
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:28,200
you're talking i'm multitasking um back though to a little bit more information about black rose

837
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:36,600
um it was included as a license table for pinball arcade and um goodness i accidentally turned on the

838
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:45,160
stream when i didn't mean to there we go all right so sorry about that um it also was included in

839
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:51,800
williams pinball volume two for pinball fx3 um and included in williams pinball classics in 2001

840
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:58,920
that came out for pc so there you go now i will tell you this is seriously still one of my

841
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:06,200
favorite tables ever um it uh it you might you know if you go to like a trade show or something

842
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:15,000
and you see it out there um it is it's one that people tend to pass up because it seems kind of

843
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:22,120
generic blah blah blah whatever you know but it really is super fun that center cannonball ramp

844
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:26,680
is it probably just makes most of the fun in the game for me and you know you have like these

845
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:37,720
light up targets that say uh sink ship um so it really is just a lot of fun um and i mean as

846
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:42,360
people can see from the video up here it's fairly unique little table it's got enough in there i

847
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:49,160
think it'll keep bringing people back to playing it so um definitely wanna um make sure that all

848
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:53,720
of you out there give this table a shot because it's really a lot of fun don't pass it up if you

849
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:59,480
find one to play all right there it is your classic pinball table of the month black rose

850
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:06,040
and this is our maties yeah that's a fun table and you and it's in your collection at your house

851
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:14,200

852
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:19,800

853
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:23,880
leave us a little soon tonight um so do you want to get into your rapid fire stories here real

854
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:31,640
quick before we uh say goodbye sure um forever entertainment um uh has said that the revenue

855
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:38,840
from panzer dragoon remake has exceeded the production costs so um by more than double so

856
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:46,440
yeah they made the money back good for them hooray and um in other news um a first person resident

857
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:53,720
evil 8 is in the works and should be out by next year at least that seems to be some speculation

858
01:19:53,720 --> 01:20:01,080
they're thinking it might be switched but again i don't know i don't i they kind of lost me so

859
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:06,440
i only care about the early ones yeah i but i don't know if i want to see him remake resident

860
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:11,400
evil 4 because i heard resident evil 3 like they really kind of they they kind of changed it quite

861
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:16,680
a bit like they they didn't really stick to it well the big thing on there is with jill's design

862
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:22,680
i was reading is that they tried to make her like take out the sex appeal as much because honestly

863
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:26,840
who's gonna run around fighting zombies in a fucking mini skirt and tube pop yeah it's like

864
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:32,520
running away from dinosaurs in high heels yeah yeah so um but the thing is that you know and

865
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:37,240
this is actually the quote is that they didn't want her to be in something that would be

866
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:42,840
uncomfortable for her task um and i think that's great and it kind of makes me consider that maybe

867
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:47,640
this will be the next cosplay that i revisit because one of my very early ones uh for my

868
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:56,360
first anime expo actually was um jill valentine old school jill all right there you go looking

869
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:59,720
forward to seeing it all right well um dark sakura i know you're heading out but do you

870
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:04,840

872
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:16,920

873

875
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:32,360
great to hear from you tonight all right all right um let's move on with some other rapid

876
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:39,240
fire news uh loki you want to take your your stuff sure okay so i was unaware that they

877
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:48,680
were still even making um updates to this game but apparently rock smith uh 2014 remastered

878
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:55,560
has um ubisoft san francisco has basically said that they're done adding dlc to rock smith so

879
01:21:55,560 --> 01:22:03,800
right now they have a library of 1570 songs and yeah apparently they're working on a new project

880
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:11,080
now um it's interesting that's been going on this long i like i said i was completely aware that

881
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:16,760
they were still supporting that game so yeah i knew they were supporting it a while i didn't

882
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:21,320
realize it was like still going on even in 2020 i thought the last time i really saw the dlc was

883
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:27,480
last year but that's still very impressive and it was remastered so i was not aware of that either

884
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:33,560
so yeah neat um yeah so that's unfortunate but i guess we'll have to see what's coming from

885
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:39,480
ubisoft san francisco and then of course this time of the month since we're being a brand new

886
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:44,600
month and everybody is at home it's time to figure out what are the brand new free games that you can

887
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:50,040
get from your subscription services so we have playstation plus which is going to be gracing us

888
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:57,640
with uncharted 4 and dirt rally 2.0 so those are going to be available very soon april 7th through

889
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:06,520
may 4th on the xbox side of the house we've got project cars 2 and nights of pen and paper

890
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:12,920
and then of course on the xbox 360 side we have fable anniversary and toy box turbos

891
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:21,240
all right i didn't i i had forgot they even made a fable anniversary edition but i want to probably

892
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:27,080
check that out i like those games they're fun yep all right uh moving on over to some other news uh

893
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:32,200
this one's about saints row the third uh i don't know what do you think about this loki apparently

894
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:38,200
a remaster could be coming the esrb had a listing for saints row the third remastered uh do out on

895
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:43,160
pc playstation 4 and xbox one you might remember originally these games are on pc playstation 3

896
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:49,400
and xbox 360 um but it's um i guess there was a nintendo switch port as well but it wasn't

897
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:54,280
very good uh that just came out last year but potentially these games could be remade and coming

898
01:23:54,280 --> 01:24:00,040
out again on playstation 4 and xbox one although i would think why not start for playstation 5 and

899
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:03,480
the other one but maybe i don't know maybe it's not going to be that big of a remaster i don't

900
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:10,040
know what do you think um i thought that they i mean i guess i guess it was saints row 4 that

901
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:15,240
they had remastered um i mean i i guess it wouldn't be that much of a stretch since um

902
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:21,640
four wasn't that much of a stretch from three so i mean it's practically the same engine

903
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:29,400
so i wouldn't see how that would be a hard thing for them to um port in there yeah it's just kind

904
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:34,280
of killing time i guess until we get a new announcement for saints row oddly enough though

905
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:40,520
because i did end up buying the humble bundle the covet 19 one it did have agents of mayhem in there

906
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:46,280
i saw that it was probably never gonna buy that game but now you got it at least for a good time

907
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:52,840
yeah all right uh also in a quick rapid fire story our last one tonight uh cellar door games in a

908
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:57,560
tweet mentioned that they are working on rogue legacy 2 that's right they're confirming that

909
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:02,120
rogue legacy 2 is in development and they'll be releasing more info later this week in the coming

910
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:07,080
days and there's some screenshots there on their twitter account over at cellar door games and i

911
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:14,120
do want to thank all the folks on um our uh twitter uh and i'm sorry on our discord server for sending

912
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:20,040

913
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:25,000
a lot of the things you guys posted in our discord over at vog network dot com slash discord uh we've

914
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:31,080
included on tonight's show so thank you very much for that all right let's move on and travel around

915
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:37,160
the world and check out some release dates and we're going to start in the us loki all right not

916
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:43,560
a whole lot this week so we've got of course disaster report for summer memories on pc

917
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:49,480
nintendo switch and playstation 4 and then of course final fantasy 7 remake is going to be

918
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:54,520
coming out on playstation 4 and that's it yeah and i imagine with everything else going on in

919
01:25:54,520 --> 01:26:00,200
the world some of these uh things are you know in influx in limbo and all that good stuff so uh

920
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:04,120
trying to pull up the japanese release dates it's being very slow but i'm pretty sure that

921
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:10,280
final fantasy 7 remake is also a thing uh but on the nintendo switch you can look forward to

922
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:18,440
um let's see a uh i guess there's a whole bunch of animal crossing um like accessories that are

923
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:23,960
out this week but i don't see any actual new games on the switch this week probably because over on

924
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:30,440
the playstation 4 the final fantasy 7 remake is out and final fantasy 7 game or fun fantasy games

925
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:35,560
including 7 tend to do very well in japan uh the only other thing i see uh that is coming out in

926
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:41,240
japan this week is a tom clancy rainbow 6 siege deluxe edition uh that is getting a japanese

927
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:46,360
localized release this week otherwise enjoy that final fantasy 7 remake hell you can even get a

928
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:52,760
playstation 4 or a playstation 4 pro that's a special final fantasy 7 bundle so check that out

929
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:58,280
but that is your big release in japan this week how about europe not a lot coming out in europe

930
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:06,520
as well so we've got cooking mama cook star on nintendo switch and final fantasy 7 remake oddly

931
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:11,720
enough based on the release dates i have here unless that changes this is all we're getting

932
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:17,320
for the next few weeks uh with everything that's going on in the world i'm not completely surprised

933
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:22,920
to hear that to be honest so um it is what it is you notice we're hearing other things get shift

934
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:27,800
back and moved around and i think some of these retail sites that we use to get this information

935
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:34,280
are probably changing because the retail end of things is uh kind of closing down and changing so

936
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:39,640
yeah anyway uh i need to pull up the mailbag here you know what maybe we'll do things a little bit

937
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:43,240
out of order uh loki do you want to read the next story here while i pull up the mailbag

938
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:50,120
sure so this is kind of a continuation like we had last week where we're talking a little bit

939
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:55,320
about gamestop and there is a little bit we could talk about game as well but um talking a little

940
01:27:55,320 --> 01:28:01,400
bit more about game exchange so you may remember game exchange is kind of an independent retailer

941
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:08,040
that is similar to a gamestop in certain regions of the united states well um last week we had

942
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:14,040
employees kind of speaking out saying that you know there's issues with you know the sort of

943
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:19,080
thinking that it could be deemed essential considering that gamestop is they're saying

944
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:27,240
they're essential so apparently though now instead of actually uh providing them with you know

945
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:34,360
instructions to close their stores they've been providing them with tips to keep safe instead so

946
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:40,040
like take a sip of warm water every 12 or 20 minutes this keeps your mouth moist and washes

947
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:45,080
away any viruses that enter your mouth into your stomach where your gastric juices will neutralize

948
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:50,360
it these are no these are like fucking bullshit facebook chain posts that like really bored

949
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:57,320
karens are spreading around that are quite harmful actually yes so basically a bunch of these types

950
01:28:57,320 --> 01:29:06,920
of uh things you know try avoiding cold it's just doesn't make any sense um so yeah so they've been

951
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:13,960
given this kind of information via an email that was sent to staff on tuesday um and apparently

952
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:21,400
this is from their vice president of retail operations Mindy Kent it's just it's ridiculous

953
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:26,840
and they really need to close these stores down but based on what i'm hearing and there was

954
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:31,080
another video that came out this week about you know some of the gamestop stuff and of course

955
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:37,560
a lot of that is still like rumor until we get from like other sources but um basically saying

956
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:44,360
that gamestop legal is trying to find a way to find a loophole where they can stay as um

957
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:49,080
as trying to deem themselves essential and reopen their stores or they have reopened their stores

958
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:54,520
and are basically fighting the situation and i've read that there's several states that have

959
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:58,520
actually cracked down on them to the point where they've just sent in police to shut them down

960
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,960
yeah and i think it's logical we just flow into the next story here before you get to

961
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:09,960
the mailbag and talk about the game stops in massachusetts so all the game stops in

962
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:14,120
massachusetts have closed and uh it doesn't sound like it was something they really wanted to do

963
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:19,480
but here's what happened the inspection services department for the city of boston went to the

964
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:25,080
dorchester store and basically ordered them to close they didn't get a fine but they got issued

965
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:31,320
a nuisance order so yes gamestop got declared a public nuisance this week for their antics at

966
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:37,560
least in boston they did um so they actually followed up went back on wednesday to make sure

967
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:42,200
that it was closed and gamestop confirmed to a report in the boston globe they did close all

968
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:48,680
massachusetts stores on thursday um don't know if gamestop is shut down in any other states

969
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:53,160
although california where we're at they did all close they had to follow the governor's order

970
01:30:55,160 --> 01:31:00,040
yeah remember i i said that there might be a possibility of getting posters well i don't

971
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:03,960
think that's going to happen they've already taken signage of the store that's closing nearby here

972
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:08,040
and i mean it makes sense i don't even know when they would be reopening in the first place

973
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:14,040
yeah so oh well yeah it's it's a bummer we lost out on that but completely understandable due to

974
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:18,280
everything else that's going on in the world for sure yeah so all right i think we can now uh take

975
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:22,440
a trip back up to the mailbag and i can read some of these emails that came in uh because we

976
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:25,800
actually got some emails this week thank you very much and if you want to send some emails

977
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:30,920
participate at orange lounge trader.com is the place to send those emails so let's go to our

978
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:36,600
first email tonight from sia tabiri who says hello everyone i often mean to write in but because i'm

979
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:40,200
usually in the chat room i tend to neglect the whole email thing well that's okay we love that

980
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:44,840
you're participating one way or another i know that licensed games are generally not accepted

981
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:51,080
well but are there any non-video game properties you would like to see adapted into a game if so

982
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:55,720
what genre would best fit it and what specific mechanics would you like to see in that game

983
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:01,480
the easiest thing that comes to mind for me is i want to see more game shows adapted like one

984
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:07,000
versus 100 on xbox 360. i think that's like my easy go-to answer because that was a real crime

985
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:11,880
what happened with that whole thing and that it's not around anymore so that's like my easy

986
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:15,880
go-to answer but let me continue on with sia tabiri's email and then i'll get loki's answer

987
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:23,160
personally i would love to see a telltale games type enhanced visual novel a la wolf among us

988
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:28,040
for the tv series version of the magicians or perhaps something more along the lines of

989
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:32,840
psychonauts where you delve into different magicians power sets to tell a more original

990
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:37,480
story within the universe i hope you're all doing well and that this question wasn't as dumb as i'm

991
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:43,480
starting to feel like it was take care no it's not a dumb question uh what type of uh license

992
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:48,600
i open this up to chad as well what do you guys think what's like a um like a licensed property

993
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:56,600
you want to see put into a game loki any thoughts yeah so a licensed property i'd love to see

994
01:32:57,480 --> 01:33:06,680
would be a um a vr version of nailed it it's my head my my brain was going to nailed it as well

995
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:11,560
so i was thinking of a cooking mama crossover somehow except one that isn't farming for bitcoin

996
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:17,000
or or if we want to like really get rid of this aside from just vr let's just have the folks from

997
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:25,160
uh that created uh surgeon simulator to do nailed it just have a really crappy like control thing

998
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:29,960
where you have to move the hands and stuff i just want the commentary from nicole buyer because i

999
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:34,600
fucking love her speaking of nailed it by the way if i don't mention this tweet at some point during

1000
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:38,920
the show i'm gonna get a nasty gram from shane because he tweeted me earlier this week apparently

1001
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:46,440
in the first episode of the new season of nailed it they use music from mass effect and like it's

1002
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:50,360
it's like it's music that was made for mass effect and it's on the mass effect soundtrack it's the

1003
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:55,400
synthesis ending music of all things is in nailed it he even sent me the clip on my on my twitter

1004
01:33:55,400 --> 01:34:01,240
account uh and it's it's so it's just funny that you're seeing these uh video game things get used

1005
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:06,360
in other places how do they even find that music to use i don't know it's just like a there's weird

1006
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:13,080
probably some nerd on staff that decided that hey i'm gonna sneak this in there you know they

1007
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:17,240
i'm sure they have the license it but i'm just gonna slide it in there for the few people that

1008
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:24,680
will even get what it is uh phoenix 77 26 says how about trauma center like a game centered around

1009
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:30,600
house md i like that one uh tiger claw says how about a video game adaptation of the rocky horror

1010
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:35,720
picture show but call it the rocky horror video game show so believe it or not that's already

1011
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:43,080
happened except it was um a game adaptation of the play the rocky horror show um and that is on

1012
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:51,080
way back in the commodore 64 days uh and uh they did make a new one on cd rom when they did the i

1013
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:55,160
think there was a revival i don't remember if they made it around the new york city broadway revival

1014
01:34:55,160 --> 01:35:01,000
or if it was around a british revival in like 2005 or something like that but spoiler alert

1015
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:10,680
neither game can you mute loki loki go on mute classic zoom meeting uh but i guess here's

1016
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:16,600
mechanical keyboard but spoiler alert neither rocky horror game was very good um but just

1017
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:19,800
if you didn't know they actually did make those games and neither were very good

1018
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:28,680
um speaking of uh i said newer phoenix newer uh speaking of um uh things that didn't translate

1019
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:34,200
very well phoenix had suggested what would you think of a drag race game they did a dragopolis

1020
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:42,280
do you remember that it was on cell phones and also not the best game in the world sorry to say

1021
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:47,480
sorry i know some developers probably did their best on it but it was just too limited by the

1022
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:52,360
mobile phone and it's just i think that game is not the reason why people watch drag race you

1023
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:57,240
know people watch drag race for the horrible puns and the lip syncing and the fun challenges and

1024
01:35:57,240 --> 01:36:01,400
things like that and as much as i think sure a drag race game would be a great idea and i think

1025
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:06,440
i've joked about it before in like a dream game or something have you ever played project runway on

1026
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:11,480
the we and let's be real ruble's drag race is a spoof of like project runway and america's next

1027
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:16,280
top model it started as a spoof but then it like became self-aware somewhere along the line um

1028
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:24,200
but the point is project runaway on the we mama this is garbage it's the best way i could put it

1029
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:28,840
it's not good uh so i don't know how a rupaul's drag race game would just like be good like it's

1030
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:34,680
just it's just not going to be good um but i suppose you know i i linked in uh twitch chat

1031
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:39,880
be linked because thankfully all of these characters oh yeah the Commodore 64 games are in

1032
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:45,000
the archive so they have a rocky horror show thank you oh there you go tiger claw go check that out

1033
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,360
maybe it'll be a classic game of the week sometime although again it's not very good

1034
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:53,320
it's really not good all right uh oh and act deft are responding to the nailed it thing and

1035
01:36:53,320 --> 01:37:01,000
shane's tweet saying rob in mexico a lot of news shows use video game music a lot like no joke

1036
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:06,040
it's almost a meme it's kind of funny i don't know why that's so funny anyway well thank you

1037
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:11,240
see you tiberi for the email that was good uh moving on to another email from ronma tonight

1038
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:15,480
who emailed us participate at orange lounge radio.com and you should too for next week

1039
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:21,080
rama asks there hasn't been much in the way of talking about food so here's a question for you

1040
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:28,600
all what is your favorite go-to comfort food mine is what some people call roman holiday or goulash

1041
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:34,280
it's a mix of pasta sauce meat and cheese i can make a big batch of it and eat it all day and all

1042
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:39,800
week and not be bored with it that's all for now till next time i'm sure a lot of people i'm

1043
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:45,480
putting on i'm putting on quarantine wait because of all the stinking food i'm eating being trapped

1044
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:51,320
at home and there's plenty of comfort food snacks in there but do you have a go-to comfort food

1045
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:58,040
loki no but i have important information so you may remember that you know i was obsessed with

1046
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:04,440
bond's uh honey butter chicken for a while and they of course closed down and i have not been

1047
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:10,840
able to fill that void until recently when i decided to make wings and i found a honey

1048
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:19,000
butter recipe that i used and that stuff is crack it is absolute crack i love it i will make as much

1049
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:24,520
of that sauce as possible and i will literally now put it on anything and it is awesome so so

1050
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:31,640
loki's answer is honey butter basically yes three tablespoons butter three tablespoons honey one

1051
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:37,160
tablespoon of soy sauce and chopped garlic probably about two cloves or so mix that all

1052
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:42,840
together simmer it in a pot or whatever and just like dip everything in it i did not expect loki

1053
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:46,920
would be the one i'm getting cooking tips from on the show don't worry cooking loki will fix it

1054
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:53,240
um let's see so my comfort food uh so we have this local chain and they're not paying me to

1055
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:57,320
give an advertisement but i'm going to anyway and and loki mentions them all the time on the

1056
01:38:57,320 --> 01:39:00,280
show anyway because he brings their food in all the time but it's round table pizza i think they're

1057
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:04,760
a west coast thing i don't think they have them on the east coast but they have them like arizona

1058
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:11,400
and stuff right okay so they're pretty bomb pizza and like the pepperoni and olive specifically

1059
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:16,840
takes me back to being a kid and like that used to be the pizza that my grandma would order when

1060
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:20,760
i would go like stay with her for a weekend and things like like it would be it would always be

1061
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:24,200
exciting times to go to grandma's house for the weekend because she would without fail

1062
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:29,960
always order pepperoni and olive pizza from round table which is that's the one we just got so um

1063
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:35,160
yeah i guess i gave him free ad but whatever it uh it's it is comfort food i know that's weird

1064
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:38,520
because it's not really something you make in your kitchen but i still think comfort food kind of

1065
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:45,880
evokes a certain memory um the other one and this would go back to grandma's house as well because

1066
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:52,360
she always had a well-stocked cupboard of sour cream and onion pringles because i think they

1067
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:57,560
were probably her favorite but they're definitely mine as well and uh i i probably ate or had ate

1068
01:39:57,560 --> 01:40:02,760
her out of house at home uh on those um sour cream and onion pringles and that would be

1069
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:06,840
another comfort food and another company that didn't pay me to give them an ad but it is what

1070
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:13,480
it is i mean that's the comfort food i like so um act dev says i do remember them uh round table

1071
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:18,200
we used to have one in the city next to where i live i used to play in the arcade it had oh yeah

1072
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:23,320
the the i always forget round table like i guess they technically still have arcades but they're

1073
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:28,440
you know crappy crane games and things like that but back in the day they have the clubhouse once

1074
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:35,480
now they have uh crappy a little bit larger of an arcade yeah but yeah it's still they

1075
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:41,240
they still technically each have an arcade but they're like yeah they're crappy but that used

1076
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:48,120
to be the place where without fail there was always an iron man iron stewart super off-road

1077
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:51,560
game always that game was in every fucking round table i've ever been to

1078
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:56,680
and um so that which that game was fucking great it's one of my all-time favorite arcade games we

1079
01:40:56,680 --> 01:41:01,000
don't talk about it enough on the show how fucking great that game is the first round table and see

1080
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:06,120
because this is back pizza places used to be just like i don't know what it is nowadays where

1081
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:10,840
everything's all bright and cheery but they used to be dingy and dark that's always like all of

1082
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:15,320
these places even like like shakies do you forget am i am i that old that i'm the only one that

1083
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:20,680
remembers shaky's pizza but going to shaky's pizza was going to like a fucking like like damp castle

1084
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:28,360
with the gigantic doors it was something it was super dark but i remember like um

1085
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:34,280
at the first round table i'd ever been to uh i think it's the first one um they used to play

1086
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:39,000
pole position there because they used to have this arcade that was kind of just down these stairs and

1087
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:45,080
not really like a basement but it was like down some stairs in a room um but yeah it was it was

1088
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:48,920
always very dark i remember all of them being dark and even chuckie cheese was like that

1089
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:54,520
actually you know what that might have to do with some of the things these uh kind of are

1090
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:57,800
derivatives of because now that i didn't really think about this until you mentioned that but

1091
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:04,200
now that i think about it like i remember going to a fancy um uh deep dish place in chicago uh it

1092
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:09,080
was actually a misty because we were we didn't get to go because the weight was like forever but it

1093
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:13,160
was very dark in there and it was all like candle lit type of thing and then i'm thinking have you

1094
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:18,360
been to zelda's in downtown sac it's all candle lit it's all dark and candle lit there so i think

1095
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:24,040
there's something about like pizza places be and i feel like chicago fire is a pretty dark place

1096
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:27,160
too i don't know if it's only like chicago because zelda's is a really good deep dish place i don't

1097
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:31,400
know if it's like a deep dish pizza thing or what but i feel like the dark pizza place thing like

1098
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:38,200
goes back like it's not just chain restaurants that we remember growing up who knows but then

1099
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:42,040
i also remember straw hat which was in a strip mall and it was very bright because the windows

1100
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:47,240
were right there so they weren't all dark all right anyway there we go pizza discussion thank

1101
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:51,160
you uh rama i hope we didn't let you down with that and rama i know about it because i know

1102
01:42:51,160 --> 01:42:56,200
you're from new york i know better that it get into the chicago versus new york pizza i'm not

1103
01:42:56,200 --> 01:43:01,960
going to do that i'm i'm a fat boy and i'm going to say there is room for both there is i love them

1104
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:07,480
both so i'm not going to get into the chicago versus new york debate yes to both that is the

1105
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:12,920
correct answer what i want to find out though is they have this new pizza place pizza bar place

1106
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:17,880
that's opened up um that i haven't been to i keep driving by though it's called boston's pizza

1107
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:25,080
and i'm curious to see what boston style pizza is interesting it's just i don't know it's the

1108
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:29,160
new pizza place got chicken up do you remember though speaking since we've given chicago pizza

1109
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:35,000
a highlight do you remember though there used to be that new york pizza place um it was over in

1110
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:40,760
sowsack and it was i don't remember the name of it but they had a max it was the only max 2 machine

1111
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:45,320
in town for the longest time and they had some fucking delicious pizza do you remember that place

1112
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:50,760
it was no i don't remember no i know you went once it was in south sacramento

1113
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:55,240
off fruit ridge or something and like that's that's quite a drive for like i think at the

1114
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:57,960
time i was out in roseville or something that's quite a drive down there but it was

1115
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:02,040
like the only place in town you can play max 2 for a little bit so anyway

1116
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:12,520
uh i i don't think i ever went there act deft in chats no it wasn't godfather's it was it was

1117
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:17,080
definitely it was in new york was giovanni's because there is a giovanni one here in sack

1118
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:20,280
but it's not in south side but anyway i think it might have been that but anyway it was it

1119
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:25,800
was definitely new york pizza um let's see uh act deft in chat says which style of pizza do you

1120
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:33,400
prefer yes that is exactly exactly that the only i am not a fan of chicago style pizza

1121
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:38,040
yeah i love i love them both like there's a time and a place for both i really do and i

1122
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:41,960
understand i understand some people like poo poo on the chicago thing because you're eating

1123
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:46,360
it with a knife and a fork so it's not but you know what i'm just i'm i'm not here to debate it

1124
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:54,920
i'm just here to eat it if you want to fight me on chicago pizza i will eat that pizza before

1125
01:44:54,920 --> 01:45:00,200
you're done arguing and then you won't have a problem all right anyway let's move on all right

1126
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:05,000
we got past the game exchange and game stop thing uh let's talk about this because this is uh an

1127
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:08,680
another unfortunate kind of side effect of everything that's going on in the world and

1128
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:13,800
that is that the national game museum is saying that they are in danger of closing because of

1129
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:17,720
what's going on with the coronavirus i do want to point out this is the national video game museum

1130
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:24,440
in the uk uh and you can follow them on twitter at nvmuk and they actually made a tweet saying

1131
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:29,640
we need your help the uk's only museum dedicated to video game culture and education is threatened

1132
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:35,720
with permanent closure by coronavirus despite 40 000 visitors in 2019 we have no safety net of

1133
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:40,920
funding to ensure our new charity atlas a prolonged shutdown the uk is in danger of

1134
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:46,120
losing this unique venue with nearly 100 playable exhibits school workshops and family events so

1135
01:45:46,120 --> 01:45:50,920
they're actually doing a crowdfunding page to try to i guess make up some of the stop gap that

1136
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:56,200
they're losing because you know we're on a shutdown here in the us in most states

1137
01:45:56,200 --> 01:46:02,920
i think there are better than the yelp crowdfund idea that they oh yeah oh god that was horrible

1138
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:07,080
that was horrible no this isn't this is a officially sanctioned by and on their official

1139
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:13,960
twitter uh and nvmuk yeah if you guys didn't hear about that yelp man that's so shitty what they did

1140
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:19,800
they were setting up uh crowdfunding things and the owners didn't even know about it all the time

1141
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:25,960
it's just really shady anyway um anyway but this is official and is something you should look uh

1142
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:30,920
be checking into especially if you are over in the uk but you can certainly help uh from anywhere so

1143
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:37,560
um check that out over on their official twitter for more information nvmuk all right let's move

1144
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:41,720
on loki what do you have for us before we get towards the end of the show here so this is

1145
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:51,960
amazing uh but there's actually a new game coming from atari it's a pong rpg so it's pong quest and

1146
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:57,880
it looks very cute it's got these qt graphics and you play like a pong paddle that's dressed up in

1147
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:04,920
costumes and you fight other pong paddles as well so they have character customization and it's a

1148
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:11,640
very tongue-in-cheek looking game it's being developed by uh uk design duo uh checkered inc

1149
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:17,800
huh it's supposed to be coming out in consoles and pc this spring it's interesting to see all

1150
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:21,960
the different ways they've reinvented pong over the years that's for sure yeah they have like

1151
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:27,160
incorporate other atari games into it so they have like uh stuff in the trailer about centipede and

1152
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:33,480
adventure so it's kind of cool very cool all right and one more story for you guys about you know

1153
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:39,240
what what is sorry it has an autoplay video on the site uh what what are they doing on sports tv

1154
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:43,160
when there's no sports um because we're not able to get together in sporting arenas and things like

1155
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:46,920
that and of course as we've talked about over the last few weeks there seems to be this growing

1156
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:53,720
trend into esports and espn took that up another notch this past weekend i must admit i didn't see

1157
01:47:53,720 --> 01:47:58,440
it maybe some of you in chat did and want to tell me about it but my understanding is that the nba

1158
01:47:58,440 --> 01:48:04,840
and 2k kind of came together to do an nba 2k tournament that was on espn and espn 2 and it

1159
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:09,320
actually all started on friday and it's running through april 11th so we're in the middle of it

1160
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:15,080
right now um it was uh on espn on friday with a half hour pre-show and then they ran it um

1161
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:21,400
on espn for like an hour and a half and it went over to espn 2 uh and there are 16 nba players

1162
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:26,600
competing including kevin durant uh donovan mitchell devin booker so there's lots of uh

1163
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:33,480
nba celebrities competing in this the winner of the event will get 100 000 to give to a charity

1164
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:38,120
supporting coronavirus relief specifically so that's going to be a win-win situation

1165
01:48:38,120 --> 01:48:45,320
um all together and uh is definitely an example of what you got to do on tv right now to um

1166
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:50,600
fill in the time because we don't know when the nba or any of that stuff is coming back and it's

1167
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:54,840
kind of like something i alluded to earlier in the show you know a lot of these sports events have

1168
01:48:55,640 --> 01:49:01,240
thousands of people that go to the arenas and they may not want those large gatherings for a little

1169
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:08,920
while um maybe they'll allow and again i'm just fortune telling here listen to doctors as a

1170
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:14,680
scientist maybe they'll allow smaller groups like 50 so that maybe they can get the the the people

1171
01:49:14,680 --> 01:49:18,120
there to record the game and play the game and maybe that'll be okay maybe they just play it

1172
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:22,520
to empty stadiums but we don't know we we just don't know the future is kind of uncertain in

1173
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:28,360
that way um so they're having to fill the time right now with what to do um sj100 matt says the

1174
01:49:28,360 --> 01:49:32,200
reviews i've read is that it's kind of boring i don't know if these reviewers are gamers but i

1175
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:36,360
think people were expecting players to heavy trash talk each other and they're not doing that it's

1176
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:40,600
kind of quiet between the players i have yet to see it so it's kind of what the early vibe seems

1177
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:45,000
to say is that maybe it's not the side of the players we're used to seeing on the court because

1178
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:48,360
it's a little more casual maybe because for charity they're toning it down i don't know

1179
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:53,080
um act f says some soccer leagues are doing something similar and i think f1 racing is also

1180
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:58,120
doing it and streaming it on twitch and bobby blackwolf says espn was showing the madden

1181
01:49:58,120 --> 01:50:03,960
championships today but it was a rerun from back in december and january so uh very interesting

1182
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:10,840
to see the sports um folks having to really fill time i mean on the good side of things

1183
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:19,000
there's no bars right now to gather to see these in anyway but i'm sure these tv companies are like

1184
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:23,960
that's our bread and butter what are we going to do so it seems you know like definitely these um

1185
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:28,440
online things are kind of filling in the gap a little bit so that you know people will still uh

1186
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:33,880
be there to tune in and the flip side of that might be that tv ends up being the only way to

1187
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:37,960
participate in these things for a little while so there might you know might be a little time

1188
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:43,080
of weirdness but then it's going to kind of pay off double hopefully um well i don't know i'd

1189
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:46,920
rather go back to the old way but you know what i mean uh for the folks that all are working and

1190
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:51,960
making the tv they can um get back into that hopefully a little earlier than everything else

1191
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:58,600
we'll see so all right nifty 805 says chicken wing sales are down yeah when there's no football

1192
01:50:58,600 --> 01:51:04,520
parties that's not necessarily true chicken wings are very hard to find really well but wingstop is

1193
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:09,880
like that half their business comes from uh ball games and things like that i'm sure well true i'm

1194
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:14,280
talking about like in stores because people keep uh oh yeah that's doing awesome i've had to go

1195
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:18,200
like see recently when i go grocery shopping i have to go to three stores to get everything that

1196
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:25,240
we need yeah uh which is not necessarily fun but it's been less crazy this week um i did end up i

1197
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:31,640
found paper towels which is ridiculous um that was a random thing i found early on too is paper

1198
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:37,080
towels and luckily we have plenty of toilet paper because alan like the week before we went on the

1199
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:42,680
cruise alan bought some and then that was when all hell broke loose so anyway uh it is time for the

1200
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:46,360
listener roundtable i'm sorry it's a typo there in the sidebar because i used an old template it's

1201
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:49,720
listed around table via chat tonight we're not gonna be able to do discord so if you have any

1202
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:54,920
questions for us in chat uh go ahead and put those in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network

1203
01:51:54,920 --> 01:52:00,360
if you have anything uh you'd like to ask us there uh pod culture and chat saying yeah even wonderfest

1204
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:08,360
is up in the air now i am accepting the reality that dragon con could not happen i'm crossing my

1205
01:52:08,360 --> 01:52:13,720
fingers and toes that it does but i think there's just a lot of unanswered question marks still on

1206
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:18,840
the whole thing uh again just because we can get back to some sense of normalcy are they going to

1207
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:24,040
want 80 000 people to get together i don't know again i think it's just too early to say um i did

1208
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:31,640
buy my flights this past week because here this is what i think will happen flights are really

1209
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:36,440
cheap right now i don't know if you're aware but flights are really cheap right now so i wanted to

1210
01:52:36,440 --> 01:52:42,280
get in on the good deal because i have a feeling when they do say it's okay to fly again you're

1211
01:52:42,280 --> 01:52:48,040
gonna have all these business travelers snatching it up to catch up on lost work and the price of

1212
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:52,280
those air tickets is gonna go way up because that backlog of people who haven't been able to travel

1213
01:52:52,280 --> 01:52:56,600
for a while are gonna suddenly want to do it so that's just you know i i don't know anything and

1214
01:52:56,600 --> 01:53:01,480
if airlines do close or whatever i feel like airline tickets may be a little harder to come

1215
01:53:01,480 --> 01:53:06,520
by for a bit so i wanted to lock that in now and the airline that i'm flying has a pretty generous

1216
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:11,000
refund policy in this scenario you can imagine like they they change their policies specifically

1217
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:17,240
for things bought in the month of april uh and and march so i feel okay about it that if if for

1218
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:21,240
whatever reason the convention doesn't happen i could still use that money and just put it towards

1219
01:53:21,240 --> 01:53:27,640
2021 or go on a different trip when it's more appropriate too i don't know so we'll see again

1220
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:34,760
it's too early to say but i i am mentally preparing myself to be disappointed because it would be very

1221
01:53:34,760 --> 01:53:40,760
disappointing but i yeah it i mean it is what it is we have to save lives so that's the most

1222
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:46,360
important thing so uh anyhow uh dart tetsuya is wondering hey have any of you all seen king's

1223
01:53:46,360 --> 01:53:51,000
avatar on netflix it's a chinese drama but it's all about this online mmo thing a bunch of

1224
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:55,720
different guilds playing together no i haven't heard of that is it um is it like a documentary

1225
01:53:55,720 --> 01:54:03,480
or is it just a scripted thing that's kind of interesting be curious about that so let's see

1226
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:11,400
also um oh yeah some folks are talking about wrestlemania um because that's a sporting event

1227
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:16,040
that's going on right now peso paca says wrestlemania was definitely odd how quiet it is

1228
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:20,280
outside of hearing the narrators and wrestlers screaming and grunts yeah i bet that was really

1229
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:25,480
weird and i guess they did that at their own facility they didn't do it um they didn't like

1230
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:29,160
empty out a stadium or anything like that like they kind of did it in their own studio or

1231
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:33,080
something i didn't watch it so i couldn't tell you but i'm sure a lot of you guys were watching

1232
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:37,800
it and i'm sure i have plenty to say about it uh okay dark tetsuya says uh that was a scripted

1233
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:45,160
drama so interesting all right nifty by the way in chat is linking to an article one thing there's

1234
01:54:45,160 --> 01:54:50,440
definitely no short of right now is chicken wings so i guess that's just at your local store loki i

1235
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:55,240
don't know it probably was yeah we went to the store yesterday because we were starting to run

1236
01:54:55,240 --> 01:54:59,640
out of some things and oh but i don't want to i you can see how there's some people that just

1237
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:06,040
don't care about like what's going on and being very careless so i'm just like oh meanwhile i'm

1238
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:11,160
like i don't have any face masks but i have a scarf from those trips i've taken back east when

1239
01:55:11,160 --> 01:55:14,520
it's cold so i kind of like wrap the scarf around my face that's like all i could do

1240
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:18,840
even though i wasn't coughing or anything but still you know just to

1241
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:21,400
just out of an abundance of caution so anyway

1242
01:55:23,080 --> 01:55:28,360
all right well any last minute stories for us loki yes um so i wanted to talk about because

1243
01:55:28,360 --> 01:55:34,120
we didn't talk about i mean obviously this week april fool's day was and and i understand that

1244
01:55:34,120 --> 01:55:39,080
a lot of people think april fools is canceled yeah i'm one of them that's why i didn't slot it

1245
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:48,200
so one company though that took it very seriously of course is mojang and mojang released a brand

1246
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:56,920
new snapshot from minecraft that's absolutely incredible so it's called snapshot 20w14 infinity

1247
01:55:56,920 --> 01:56:04,840
and is the ultimate content update now what did they do to the game they added two billion worlds

1248
01:56:05,720 --> 01:56:15,080
into the game based on player input and um so what this does is actually you know in minecraft

1249
01:56:15,080 --> 01:56:21,160
there's another portal that'll take you to the nether so with this update if you take a book

1250
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:27,640
in the game and you write whatever you want in the book that creates a new seed for a brand new

1251
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:34,360
universe basically that you throw it into the portal walk through it and it'll take you to

1252
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:40,680
one of these procedurally generated worlds based on your seed that you create so it's all sorts of

1253
01:56:40,680 --> 01:56:46,680
weird glitchy looking things that are out there plus there's several different uh worlds that they

1254
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:52,600
made themselves kind of like easter eggs that you can work to as well or find amongst all of these

1255
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:57,080
two billion worlds that are in there and at first like when i saw like the youtube videos i thought

1256
01:56:57,080 --> 01:57:01,320
oh this is just like people trying to play pranks but i saw more and more of them and actually

1257
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:07,800
watched you know how it works and no it's a legit update that adds a ton of replayability

1258
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:15,400
into the game and funny enough they added an advancement or achievement into the game

1259
01:57:15,400 --> 01:57:21,560
for visiting one billion of those worlds so you know visit one billion of them in order to get

1260
01:57:21,560 --> 01:57:26,920
that achievement but they have all sorts of weird stuff in there and brand new blocks that they

1261
01:57:26,920 --> 01:57:33,240
created specifically for this now this is aside from um the nether update which is supposed to

1262
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:38,360
be coming as well to java but i mean i can't wait to check this out i downloaded this today to go

1263
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:43,480
um play around in it but i haven't gotten a chance to play it yet because i need to reload all my uh

1264
01:57:44,120 --> 01:57:49,000
i had some scripts for using controllers in the java version and stuff like that because i have

1265
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:54,360
a new pc now i got reload all that stuff and it sucks but yeah it's really crazy just some of the

1266
01:57:54,360 --> 01:58:00,200
stuff that generates in this game so right there's uh they have like skyblock stuff in there now

1267
01:58:00,200 --> 01:58:06,280
there's just a bunch of weird dimensions that this is created so um worth checking out if you

1268
01:58:06,280 --> 01:58:12,680
have the java version go download the beta client or the snapshot release and go jump into a billion

1269
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:21,000
different worlds all right anything else uh that's it all right let me get this last question here

1270
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:25,960
from s100 max i think this is a good one uh over in our chat question because i'm finding new ways

1271
01:58:25,960 --> 01:58:32,200
to entertain myself i challenged myself to 100 super mario world within a week on just pure

1272
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:37,080
memory no online checking are there any games that you know so well you can pick it up and

1273
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:42,120
beat without researching anything uh i might struggle a little bit especially in the water

1274
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:50,440
levels but uh super metroid i'm pretty sure i could uh pecking crash my way through uh probably

1275
01:58:50,440 --> 01:58:55,240
final fantasy two and three which are really four and six of course on super nintendo i could

1276
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:58,280
probably get through those again too but those those are actually kind of linear i don't think

1277
01:58:58,280 --> 01:59:03,160
it's that hard to pick those games up and um you know because everything is kind of like gated you

1278
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:06,680
know like metroid can't get to this point unless you have this can't get to this point unless you

1279
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:11,240
have this so um i don't know if either of those answers are as impressive but i feel like those

1280
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:14,760
are two games i could definitely pick up uh loki what about you is there something you could like

1281
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:23,000
pick up in full clear just from muscle memory um i don't know like it would have to i can't think

1282
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:28,040
of an older game that i would have played so much of that i could do that oh uh akuma jp says i

1283
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:32,280
think sftn symphony of the night i think um it would be yeah symphony of the night that's a good

1284
01:59:32,280 --> 01:59:37,000
one too i bet that's one jamie could do uh act f says i could also do shovel knight from memory oh

1285
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:43,480
that's a pretty good one as well so nice bobby blackwolf says adventure for the 2600 so

1286
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:48,840
that's another one that well no actually some some parts of that can be pretty tricky i think

1287
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:52,280
so but there's some other ones i'd like to challenge myself with like the original metal

1288
01:59:52,280 --> 01:59:56,680
gear on nes i bet that would be a fun one to try again see if i can remember how to get through

1289
01:59:56,680 --> 02:00:00,760
some of those mazes and things like that all right anyway we're gonna wrap up for the night

1290
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:05,000

1292
02:00:08,840 --> 02:00:12,200

1293
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:16,280

1294
02:00:16,280 --> 02:00:22,200
uh so help us spread the word we really appreciate it um uh auto hosting on twitch that goes a super

1295
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:26,760
long way really appreciate that but otherwise just tell a friend or two where you might have heard

1296
02:00:26,760 --> 02:00:31,240
about this show uh and how to find it and that would be awesome a nice five-star review on a

1297
02:00:31,240 --> 02:00:38,280
podcasting site like itunes those go a long way as well uh and again just take care of yourself guys

1298
02:00:38,280 --> 02:00:43,160
uh take it seriously what doctors out there are saying um staying at home means you got to stay

1299
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:46,600
at home like as much as you want to see your friends and you're probably uh really want to

1300
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:49,640
hang out with them like i would love to yeah you know there was a part of me that was like

1301
02:00:49,640 --> 02:00:54,520
why don't i just have loki over it's just loki but then i thought well it's you're you know who

1302
02:00:54,520 --> 02:00:58,920
knows i may be sick and not really showing it and then you know i don't want to i don't want to give

1303
02:00:58,920 --> 02:01:03,320
that to loki so uh staying away from people means staying away from people and if we can work

1304
02:01:03,320 --> 02:01:09,880
together uh we will uh get rid of this thing a lot faster so please stay safe stay healthy

1305
02:01:09,880 --> 02:01:14,280
make good choices and all that good stuff um with that loki your final thought tonight

1306
02:01:15,640 --> 02:01:21,800
my final thought is i'm gonna play more uh try to play more games i've been trying to get to

1307
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:28,040
where i can programming um i've worked so like this week i've got uh replacement parts coming

1308
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:33,400
from my switch as well because my switch has been acting up um so i'm gonna fix the joy cons

1309
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:39,320
manually and but i still have an issue with the stupid sd card we're like literally just holding

1310
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:44,360
the switch and it keeps saying that the sd card is being disconnected so there's something weird

1311
02:01:44,360 --> 02:01:51,560
at that so i'm gonna take it apart and hopefully not break it good luck with that uh where i'm

1312
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:56,760
actually getting some new computer parts as well because my main computer uh keeps freezing suddenly

1313
02:01:56,760 --> 02:02:00,200
like it doesn't happen all the time but i i was wondering if it's like an overheating thing or

1314
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:03,800
something is it'll like freeze in the middle of a game i have to shut the system off bring it back

1315
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:09,400
up but i don't know it's just it's just really annoying me so check your fans and make sure

1316
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:13,880
they're not they are we give it we give it a big dusting we took the and it still did a freeze up

1317
02:02:13,880 --> 02:02:18,920
on me so i don't know what the hell's going on so um i was like well maybe it's an excuse to buy

1318
02:02:18,920 --> 02:02:22,920
some new computer parts i've been wanting a new video card anyway you know so we'll order them

1319
02:02:22,920 --> 02:02:26,600
and they'll get here when they get here because you know i know all that stuff is not essential

1320
02:02:26,760 --> 02:02:33,640
and it's fine new weeks shipping pretty fast are they saying all right we'll see we'll see um okay

1321
02:02:33,640 --> 02:02:38,600
akuma jp says stop downloading porn it's not it's not porn that's causing it's final fantasy 14

1322
02:02:38,600 --> 02:02:44,360
unless you consider fantasy 14 porn which you might i don't know um so my final thought is um

1323
02:02:44,360 --> 02:02:49,400
yay i i hope to get new computer parts soon as well and i will definitely be playing more near

1324
