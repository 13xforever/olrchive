Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This week, digital game sales reached an all-time high in March. Not on the news tonight, water is wet.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's a safe bet that sales in April will be even higher, and also not on the news tonight, water is a liquid.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Stay tuned for the news you may not have already heard or guessed, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 817 of our show for this April the 26th of 2020.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My name is Rob Roberts with the hiccups, excuse me, sorry, and I am joined by nobody in studio because, again, we're still doing social distancing

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
like I think most people in the world are still at this point with everything going on, and I hope everybody's hanging in there okay.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm hanging here with Captain Pikachu with his giant oversized Famicom controller here in the studio because, unfortunately, my co-hosts are not able to be here in the studio with me,

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
but they are able to join me on Discord, so say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm generally always full of Discord, you know that.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You are, but especially so on Sunday nights, right?

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah, because, you know, reasons.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And how are you hanging in there during this whole thing?

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Well, believe it or not, I am still having the lung problem.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh, no.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah, I was taken off work for like another week and a half.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh, wow.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But I'm on like some hardcore medication again, something different this time.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And it seems to be helping, so I go back to work tomorrow and see how it goes, but I also did get a rotation I applied for the first week I came back to work, so I'm pretty excited.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Well, congratulations. That's a good thing, right?

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
May the odds be ever in my favor.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's like you got a birthday present from your work. That's wonderful.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Here, more responsibility. Enjoy.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Well, I hope everything went well with your birthday in light of the crazy stuff going on in the world.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Did you get a lot of people visiting you in Animal Crossing and leaving your presents?

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Actually, I did. Well, only four people left me a present, sorry.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
One person gave me money, which was great, and then I got some songs that I wanted, which is funny.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I wanted DJ KK, and like two days later it showed up in my store.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh, nice.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I was already giving it, so yay.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yay?

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But thank you, RNG, I guess.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Isn't that the way it goes? You go out of your way to try to get something special, and then the next day it's like, oh, it's just in your nooks or whatever, just ready to go.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Or as Gwen calls it, RNG-sus.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yes, yes. Well, that's a term that goes way back to Final Fantasy XI for me.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yeah. Well, I mean, random number generator has been a gaming thing since you could do that.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Since you rolled dice in the 70s, probably even before that, really, honestly.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But at any rate, it was great, and I have to thank Brad for the elaborate kimono stand, or is it exquisite or elaborate, one or the other.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But I really like it. I super wanted it, and someone bought it before I had a chance to in the game, and I was like, it was happening to me like days in a row. I was so mad.

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And finally, two of the things I super wanted people gave to me, and I'm like, well, thank you. You are quality humans.

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Songs will be sung about you, off key, and not by me.

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:59,000
All right. Well, I owe you at least a dinner or some other type of treat when we are allowed to see each other again, which hopefully won't be another year.

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But hopefully in the coming months, we can at least hang out in small groups, but we'll see, right?

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We'll see.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
We'll see. All right. Say hello as well, joining us on Discord, to Techmaster Loki.

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Hello.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hello. Coming to us with his rock band microphone, which I still love.

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I am, yes.

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Do you actually play rock band with that microphone anymore?

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't play rock band at all. It's all in the garage, falling apart.

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I miss the plastic instrument days, man. Like, I know rock band four maybe wasn't quite...

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Because, I mean, it was hard to get people to buy into rock band four when it was like, hey, we took stuff away from rock band three.

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And now we just kind of replicated the rock band two formula.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And yes, I know rock band four got a lot stronger with it, expansion later on.

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But, you know, you got to really come out the gate roaring.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But I miss those plastic instruments days, man. I wish...

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Good times. Good times.

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yeah, I'd have to hook the Xbox 360 back up in order to play all that.

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So, I mean, probably won't do that anytime soon.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Like, I know in this era of social distancing, a lot of people are doing jackbox games.

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Like, those jackbox games are probably more popular than they ever have been.

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And they were already pretty popular beforehand.

66
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Now they're, like, super popular.

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And I feel like if rock band had had a more recent release, we might be seeing more rock band parties virtually online.

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But sadly, I mean, I'm sure somebody's playing it, but probably just not as many as you'd hope.

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
That'd be cool. Yeah.

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yeah. So, all right. Well, my co-hosts are joining me.

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And you guys are joining me in the chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network, the voice of geeks network,

72
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
where we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So if you are listening to our fair podcasts on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, wherever it is that you get your podcasts,

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
don't forget that you can actually join in on a live taping on Sunday nights.

75
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And I know with a lot of people staying at home, as you should be right now,

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
you're probably looking for more things to do on Sunday nights.

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So please come on over and say hello over at twitch.tv.

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Going to the twitch chat room for some comments, Bobby Black Wolf is there saying,

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I want them to re-release new rock band instruments because they're falling apart.

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh, yeah. That's that's a big issue that happens, too, is that like old things and that's they fall apart.

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
They don't last forever. There's very few things that last forever, save for like the Atari 2600.

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Hey, and the NES. Yeah, those those things do last.

83
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Well, with the NES, though, you still have to get you have to blow on the cartridges, right?

84
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Or moisten the contacts or whatever it is. No, no, no. That's just a wives tale.

85
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's just because it's the problem with that had to do with the manufacturer of the machines in the U.S.

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
when they were sort of that slot that drawer slot loader because they wouldn't hit the contacts properly.

87
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That was the whole problem with you just have to reseat it on the Japanese ones.

88
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That hardly ever happened, from what I understand. Well, yeah.

89
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
If you're lucky enough to have a top loader NES, then you didn't have that problem.

90
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That's why. Lucky you. Oh, she's different.

91
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But but you got to blow it before you don't know it. So, you know.

92
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Wow. No, no, no, no. And oh, a zero from the French judge.

93
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Wow. Loki. Wow. That that bombed. All right.

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But well, now that all the trademarks and patents and things are expiring on hardware,

95
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
it's very easy to get like a third party and yes.

96
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And I know some people get a little with those things because they're not the real thing,

97
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
but they they'll still play all your cartridges. And if you don't want to you know,

98
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
if you don't want to do the emulation and the high fancy things, most of them will do like a straight,

99
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
you know, port through. It's just it's never going to look the same because your TVs are high definition now,

100
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
as opposed to be used in that.

101
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I don't even remember what's called coaxial cable in the back like you used to use back in the day.

102
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Unless, of course. And I bet Jamie's got one of these, too. You've got a coaxial television that still works.

103
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Did you hook up on your old devices, too? Yeah, we've got a Vega in the room that I'm in.

104
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah. And but but I mean, like the rock band hardware, those coaxial televisions

105
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
and things are going to give out eventually. Like you're kind of lucky that you still have a Vega that works,

106
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
you know, not not everybody's are going to work forever.

107
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Well, and Vega are last gen, you know, for the CRT era of TVs.

108
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So I'm feeling a little bit more confident about that.

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But there are places that will still do CRT repair. They're just very special, you know,

110
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
like getting tires for my husband's Mustang. They don't make those tires anymore, except special order.

111
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I guess that's true. There's always if there's if there's always going to be a retro audience or and it's not just for gaming,

112
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
but there's going to be people that want to hook up their laser disc players or, you know,

113
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
old media systems and things like that to their televisions. And, you know, you're only only going to be able to do that.

114
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If you have a coaxial television, there's always going to be an audience for that.

115
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I have a word for you. What? S-video.

116
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Is that you have to is that the red, yellow, white plug plugs?

117
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I would say that video was like the big one that preceded maybe HDMI.

118
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Oh, the one with the circle. I think I had that for a hot minute. The PlayStation support the PlayStation one supported that, right?

119
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah. S-video was like the thing for a hot minute. And then, you know, but I like to think of that as what led up to HDMI.

120
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I kind of agree with Bobby component was before HDMI because the component was like the five all in one.

121
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah, but still. But still, I remember component because my first high definition television, because remember I bought an HDTV kind of early.

122
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It was in what who did we do? Was it was it when Channel three interviewed us?

123
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We were playing on the Xbox and that was on my old ass HDTV that actually had like the giant back on it.

124
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You could only hook up through component. You couldn't use HDMI on that thing.

125
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And component was where you had like a red, a blue, a green and another red and white for the audio is like five plugs.

126
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah. Well, we still got stuff that hooks up that way. I mean, it's thankfully.

127
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I mean, and the thing to deal with, with like conversion boxes is that you're going to deal with input lag.

128
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yeah. And that can be brutal if you're trying to play a music game.

129
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That can be brutal if you're trying to play a shooter game.

130
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Absolutely. A lot of games. Really. Guardian legend. Impossible.

131
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Oh, that makes me sad. All right.

132
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Well, the trick to the trick to combat that is you just have to be not good enough at music games in order for the input like to not matter.

133
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Well, this is just normal for me. Exactly. Like I couldn't tell you there's input lag on TV,

134
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
on my DVR cabinet, because I'm just not good enough to be able to detect it.

135
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:56,000
To be fair, most music games have a sort of like calibration mode, like most anything modern really has a calibration mode.

136
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So you can kind of account for a lot of that stuff.

137
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But like Jamie said, like a shooter is not going to have a calibration mode.

138
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You know, music games kind of had to put those in there.

139
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But a lot of the other older games didn't really do that.

140
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Speaking of music games quickly, before we get to our kickoff topic, I know we're talking a lot here at the top of the show,

141
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
but at least it's somewhat gaming related.

142
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Loki, you were mentioning in chat that there's a big music game that's being given away for free right now.

143
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Kind of free in quotes, right?

144
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Yes. So if you are a Twitch Prime subscriber, then you can actually get it's what was it?

145
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
A video game musical, I believe, or old school musical. I'm sorry. Yeah. OSM.

146
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The old school musical is free right now with your Twitch Prime subscription.

147
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So go market for your account or whatever, because it's a great music game.

148
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Actually, I finished that one and it was pretty good.

149
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yeah, Bobby did a lot of streams of that, I know. So he really liked that too.

150
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And I think I played it once or twice. And it was fun. It's a good game.

151
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So, hey, and you can't be free. And again, I'm using my quotey fingers.

152
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I know many of you guys are Amazon Prime and therefore Twitch Prime subscribers, and you can go grab that.

153
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And, you know, if you haven't used your free Twitch sub, you might also consider spending it here at VOG Network

154
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
and giving us the subscription here at Twitch TV.

155
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And that will allow you access to the video archives where you can go back and watch all the old episodes of Orange on Trio,

156
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
back to when we were first doing video streaming. Same thing with Bobby Blackwolf and all the specials that we do here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

157
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
But, hey, even if you're just downloading the audio podcast that's free, as it always has been for almost 18 years now,

158
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
a big thank you to supporting the show. We appreciate it.

159
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Did you see what the other free games on there are? Because I'm looking at the list right now.

160
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I didn't, actually.

161
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
There's one called Earthlock, one called Yono and the Celestial Elephants, which just looks adorable.

162
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I think I've heard of that one, yeah.

163
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Kathy Rain, a detective is born.

164
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Turok, an OSM, like we said.

165
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Aetherborn and Light Matter.

166
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So there's a lot of games right now. That's interesting because I feel like Twitch Prime kind of took a break from free games for a while,

167
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and they were doing like Fortnite kits and Apex Legends kits, and it was like add-ons for a lot of other games.

168
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So it's interesting that they kind of went back.

169
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I mean, I don't know if that's just because of the world situation or if that was a long-time strategy of theirs anyway,

170
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
to go back to some of the game giveaways, but that's pretty cool.

171
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's hard to beat the price of free, right?

172
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Speaking of free games, one other game I guess we should mention here,

173
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
because it came up quite a bit in our Discord, and I ended up tweeting about it,

174
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and it's not on our show roll tonight, so I should mention as well, if you haven't grabbed it yet,

175
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 is free right now on PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam.

176
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I incorrectly tweeted that it was also on Switch for free, although the game does exist on Switch as a plus version,

177
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
because it is the plus version with the two-player mode, it is a separate game and therefore not part of this giveaway.

178
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But again, it's hard to beat the price of free.

179
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I know some people have problems with Championship Edition 2 because the whole ghosts on rails mechanic is kind of weird.

180
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I don't know, I enjoy it, like if you start to memorize certain patterns and things, it can be a lot of fun,

181
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
and it's one of those games where you make the tiniest little screw up and it's just going to throw your score in the garbage.

182
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And so for that, the challenge is kind of fun.

183
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And the music, like if nothing else, download it just so you can play the soundtrack in the background,

184
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
because the music is outstanding.

185
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So again, that's Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Steam.

186
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So lots of places to grab that.

187
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Alright, hey, that's a great kickoff topic is to talk about free games,

188
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
but let's get into talking about, well actually this is a free game as well that many people are playing,

189
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,000
and this game is such a huge cultural phenomenon that they're getting into other things as well, such as concerts.

190
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And I of course am talking about Fortnite, which admittedly I don't think we the hosts of OLR play a lot of Fortnite.

191
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Loki, do you play any Fortnite? I feel like if anybody's playing it, it's you and it's probably your kids, not you.

192
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I haven't. I don't have time to play it, but no, my kids do it quite a bit, but I don't.

193
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Okay, yeah. I have to admit, I don't play a lot of Fortnite.

194
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I've tried a couple times. I at least can say I have played it, but the building mechanic throws me off,

195
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
and I don't know how else to explain it.

196
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
But I do like when they do weird stuff in Fortnite, and I'm using that in a complimentary way.

197
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Like when they were debuting the new Weezer album in Fortnite,

198
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I thought, this is so crazy nuts, I have to see this.

199
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Like this is something Bjork would do or something. So I had to go check that out.

200
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And now, I forgot about this, so I didn't go check it out.

201
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
But I heard a lot about it, and I'm sure many of you checked this out.

202
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,000
There was a Fortnite in-game event that happened this past week featuring Travis Scott in concert premiering a brand new track.

203
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And this set an all-time record for viewers.

204
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:02,000
12.3 million players tuned in to view the astronomical event in Fortnite by Travis Scott.

205
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And I'm sure there's archives everywhere on YouTube and Twitch streams and things like that if you want to go relive it.

206
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And I think Epic Games has on their side as well.

207
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And it's interesting in these here times that we live in right now where we can't get together in person to go to a concert.

208
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's interesting that we are exploring this idea of a virtual concert.

209
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:41,000
This kind of led me to thinking about how video games are kind of helping to fill the void in a lot of places right now in this pandemic society that we're living in.

210
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I don't know what else to call it. That's really what it is, a pandemic society.

211
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And I think many of us are hoping this pandemic society isn't forever.

212
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:57,000
But we know this pandemic society is probably going to go on in some shape or form for quite some time to come, at least until there is a vaccine or cure for COVID.

213
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Or they find a way to effectively treat COVID where people are not dying from it in such staggering numbers.

214
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And so until those things happen, I think there will be some parts of a pandemic society still going on.

215
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And we've already had some stories about how video games are doing this on previous episodes of the show.

216
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:22,000
For example, Final Fantasy XIV last week, we talked about the memorial for a Final Fantasy XIV player who had passed because of COVID.

217
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And because you can't get together en masse for funerals right now, a virtual memorial is a way to do it.

218
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Animal Crossing. There's many things going on in Animal Crossing, like weddings, maybe not a real wedding.

219
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But maybe because somebody's wedding was supposed to take place on such and such day, they did a virtual ceremony in Animal Crossing.

220
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
We saw something along those lines within the past week.

221
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:57,000
We've had several stories in the past couple weeks about esports and how not just like, it's weird to say traditional esports,

222
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:07,000
but you know, the things we know as esports like Overwatch are filling the void of the lack of physical sports on our televisions right now.

223
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
But then we also have the physical sport players trying their hands with esports, right?

224
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And so we've seen these like NBA, 2K, 20 playoffs with NBA players for charity and things like that.

225
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So like video games are filling the void in that space as well.

226
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:31,000
So it's kind of fascinating to me for as much as I've grown up in my life and gamers have always been somewhat of an underdog,

227
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
at least, you know, when I was in high school and so forth, gamers, it was a niche thing.

228
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It was a thing you had to be a nerd kind of to be into it.

229
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:46,000
But now here we are in the society that we're in, in the year 2020, and it's like video games are helping to bring us together.

230
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And I'm kind of curious, and I'll open this to our chat room as well as my co-host,

231
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:58,000
what are some other ways that you're seeing video games specifically bringing people together in this current world?

232
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And how do you think video games might continue to do that?

233
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Are we going to see more virtual concerts in light of the real thing in things like Fortnite or perhaps another game?

234
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What do you think video games are going to do for this society that we're in as the months unfold?

235
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Do any of my co-hosts want to try to tackle that question? I know that's a long question. There's a lot to talk about.

236
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I haven't seen, I would say, like a super bunch for video games other than the stuff that you can already do online.

237
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You know, like, I mean, mostly what I see is the Animal Crossing stuff. I see, you know, I guess things more on that line, things that the users have done together.

238
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:50,000
But what in the bigger picture that we are seeing things like concerts and stage plays and things like that happening.

239
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:01,000
So right now, I think that we're looking at it expanding into the complete digital realm and just even into traditional arts going that way.

240
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yeah, I mean, you know, I still stand very much by the motion, the notion, excuse me, that video games are art.

241
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And, you know, you're going to see that the one silver lining in this whole pandemic world is that you're going to see some really beautiful art,

242
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
the flowers that kind of grow from the fertilizer that's happening right now.

243
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And I think there's going to be some great games that come out of it. But that doesn't just mean games.

244
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
There's going to be great songs that come from it. There's going to be great movies and television and plays and so forth.

245
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And you're right. These other artistic industries are also challenged with how do we adapt.

246
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And you've seen like like Broadway, my heavens, the live stage world hugely impacted by what's going on.

247
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But you're seeing, you know, YouTube. Right. Right.

248
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Like Andrew Lloyd Webber is putting his shows on YouTube once a week or something like that.

249
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Which reminds me, I forgot to watch the Love Never Dies one because I was like, how bad can a sequel to Phantom of the Opera be?

250
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And I was going to try to see if it could be that bad. But I forgot to watch because that was on Friday. Right.

251
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So. Oh, well. But anyway, you know, you see that getting put out there and you see movies have been really kind of challenged without the traditional movie theater.

252
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,000
But you're seeing a lot of, you know, kind of direct to the home type of things like we've seen with the Trolls movie right onward.

253
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It seems like a lot of family movies are kind of going that route because they know there's a lot of bored kids at home right now.

254
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Right. They need to be entertained. So there's a lot of things going that direction.

255
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Whereas I think the more adult films are pushing back, like the Top Gun movie will say, are pushing back until the fall because there's hopes that maybe the theaters will still come back in some type of capacity by then.

256
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Which I, I would really hope so, even if maybe there's more social distancing and things that are involved with that.

257
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Loki, what's your take on this question? Like, how do you think video games are going to continue to help us in this modern society that we're in now?

258
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm pretty sure that they're going to keep doing this type of stuff because it's good promotion for not only Fortnite, but for whatever they're trying to promote at the same time.

259
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I mean, they've already done concerts before in Fortnite as well. I want to say that they do like a Marshmallow concert or something like that.

260
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah. Yeah, they did.

261
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And then, of course, they've done cross promotions with all sorts of things from Avengers to Star Wars to John Wick.

262
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I mean, so I'm sure there's some sort of mutually beneficial relationship that they have with these advertising partners to do that in the first place.

263
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:41,000
As far as like, I mean, granted, we're going to see a lot of people turning to games like this because it's a good way to be able to socialize with folks to play stuff.

264
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Like my kids were talking to their cousins over Zoom today, and then I think they were playing Roblox together.

265
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:55,000
So, you know, it's kind of a way to be able to socialize without going outside. So it makes sense that a free play game like this would be pretty popular.

266
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Yeah, I keep forgetting how popular Roblox is with a younger audience. It's a huge game for tweens, really.

267
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Those darn kids.

268
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Those darn kids. Lots of great answers in chat. Let me get to it over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

269
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:15,000
SG100Matt says, I think we're going to see a renaissance in entertainment like how we saw after 9-11. Not in the same way necessarily.

270
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I think there's going to be a large need for comfort games after this whole thing. I just hope that the money is there to fund these new projects.

271
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Things have a funny way of working out sometimes. I think it'll be alright.

272
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Mr. Rhizos in chat says, I work on a manufacturing company and not video game specific.

273
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
But with all the production lines off, we're exploring ways to introduce VR and AR to light them up again.

274
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Interesting we're not hearing more about that, the VR and AR being used.

275
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Maybe that has to do with the fact that, you know, not everybody has or wants a VR headset.

276
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
So maybe, you know, Fortnite, it's very easy to get that on every computer and every phone and so forth.

277
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Might be a little harder for the VR AR stuff, but certainly if it's a tech oriented thing, then there's going to be more of a tech focused audience that has adopted that stuff.

278
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
So yeah, it's going to be very interesting.

279
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I wonder if some technologies such as like HoloLens, a huge AR technology, you might see some of those things like a rush to adopt some of those things because of continued social distancing and what have you.

280
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I don't know. Just theorizing. I don't know what the future holds. If I did, I'd have a lot more questions I'd want to answer.

281
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Let's see. Fifth Dream Today in chat says, a lot of people in my local goth community, since we can't go clubbing or to shows, have been in Animal Crossing lately.

282
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:46,000
LOL. And there are huge goth Animal Crossing communities on Facebook with so much traffic right now.

283
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I don't know why I love that image because Animal Crossing is such a cutesy little game.

284
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,000
And you know that the stereotypical goth, you know, is like very like, oh, it's so everything is so black and tragic.

285
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Have you seen the glowing skull wall wallpaper and the skull fort and the skull radio and the fortune tellings set and the magic rug and all.

286
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And the pen and paper that they give you so you can draw all your own things.

287
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I've seen the pentagrams on the ground where people are coaxing villagers into sacrifice in game stuff.

288
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
There's like this like total like strappy leather outfit.

289
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
There's I think that there is stuff for all kinds of kink and as well in the game.

290
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
We have some we have some special designs going on that were in game.

291
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Vinyl masks. There needs to be more owls in the game besides just blathers and Celeste,

292
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
because what other creatures are going to be out at night when all the goths are out?

293
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Apparently, Agnes. I know I was going to say Agnes never sleeps.

294
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
OK, so I have this lady gorilla named Rocket and she always was rocket.

295
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I like you. You do not speak bad of my rocket.

296
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
You know who I hate more than Rocket? Ed.

297
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Yeah, and you know who I hate almost as much as Ed and I'm glad she's not in the game?

298
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Who?

299
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Rilla, the Hello Kitty pink gorilla annoying thing.

300
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
No, I love Rocket. You do not speak bad about Rocket.

301
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Rocket is a female gorilla who wears like she wears bright pink lipstick and always wears pink clothing.

302
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And I love her. She's great.

303
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And the thing about her, she's never up before 10 a.m.

304
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And if I, for whatever reason, I'm playing the game at like three in the morning, she's still out there doing something.

305
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
So Rocket is my town goth for sure.

306
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Out there murdering.

307
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Maybe. I don't know.

308
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Anyway, I just I'm sorry. I love the fact that Animal Crossing, of all things, has gone to the goth community, which I've been to.

309
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:55,000
The worst thing about doing orange on radio when this show started, the worst thing was that I had to stop going to the goth dance night that they used to have here locally,

310
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
because I used to have a lot of fun going and people watching at those events and smoking, smoking cloves out front.

311
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I used to go on Thursdays and then like in my workweek.

312
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Oh, yeah. I remember when I would go with Jessica.

313
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Yeah. No, no. The work the workweek ones ended.

314
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
The best one was when they were doing it. Sorry.

315
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
We're reminiscing about local stuff, but I don't care because this is good times.

316
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
The best one was when they did it Club 21 and it was on like a Friday or Saturday.

317
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Oh, when they did.

318
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I don't remember the name of it.

319
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I thought that. No, that was the rage.

320
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
There was the rage. That was that was the Sunday one that I was just referring to.

321
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
OK. And I don't remember what they called that anymore.

322
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
But there was one asylum, the asylum. Thank you, Loki.

323
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:47,000
The asylum was the one they did at the rage hashtag things people from Sacramento will understand.

324
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
So there was the asylum. But what was the one like Club 21 did like a synthesis?

325
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Was that what it's called? So this is something on like a Friday or Saturday, something that was the one that was that country club lanes.

326
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Yes. I think it moved back and forth. Yes. Yeah. I've been to that one a few times.

327
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And I also went to the one that was at, oh, gosh, it was a lesbian bar usually.

328
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yeah, that was the night they turned it. That was OK. That was it.

329
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
OK. Yeah. That was on Thursdays. I thought they did it on the weekend.

330
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Maybe they moved it, but they were doing it on a Thursday.

331
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And that's when I had that rash from taking amoxicillin that made my skin raise up looking like a spider web.

332
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
So when I went, the place that was stretched out on my skin glowed under the black light.

333
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Because, yes, I am that pale.

334
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
There was like, well, that's great. You look so cool. Is that make them like, no, it's amoxicillin.

335
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And then I'd go in the bathroom and rub like steroid cream all over my arm so I wouldn't scratch myself to death.

336
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
OK, so try to get somewhat back on topic.

337
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,000
How can video games help us relive the goth dance days of our past?

338
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I don't know. There's all kinds of ways you can goth anything up.

339
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I mean, I've seen people build entire like gothly neighborhoods.

340
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And, you know, we've got everything going on in Animal Crossing. I mean, look at the old dream towns and Animal Crossing.

341
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
You remember Ica Village? I do. I do.

342
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Yeah, I Ica Village was was the shit.

343
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:24,000
But I mean, it of course, you've got like your your general horror games, which I mean, not necessarily gothy, but some of the elements can go in.

344
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
You can see at the very says you can wear a frankenfurter hoodie in New Horizons.

345
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
The SSG 100 Matt says save your bells for Halloween.

346
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Look, when you're goth, Halloween is every day.

347
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
That's that's that's that's what it is. When you're goth, you get to celebrate Halloween every day.

348
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
You kind of get to do that when Halloween is life.

349
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You get to do that as well when you're gay. And that's why there's so much crossover, just so you know.

350
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
And to tell Derek Tetsuya, KK does have KK Durge. Just saying.

351
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Yes. Yes. KK Durge. I have KK Durge. It was like the second song I got.

352
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I don't have it yet, but I can order it for you. Thank you.

353
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I do also have my DJ KK. So I get my Eurobeat on in my basement.

354
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:12,000
All right. It sounds like we need to transition into our gaming weeks, but I thought we could talk a little bit about how gaming might help the future.

355
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Or we could just take a look back in the past, which is what we did a little bit there at the end. But that's OK.

356
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Rob, what? There is no future. There is only now. Only Zool.

357
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:30,000
All right. Anyhow, let's go back to our gaming weeks and talk a little bit about the types of games that we have been playing this week.

358
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Dark Sakura, how was Animal Crossing?

359
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Ten hours of Animal Crossing a day, pretty much. I mean, and it's more like I'll leave the game on and go walk out, you know, and then I will go water my vegetables because I have an apocalypse garden.

360
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Three of my carrots are surviving. It's really awesome.

361
00:30:49,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Yes, from death comes life. But anyway, I'm also I started to play Pokemon because I decided that I was going to see how my lungs were doing and try to take a walk.

362
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
My normal little just quick neighborhood jaunt, like, you know, maybe half a mile.

363
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I made it a fifth of a mile and came inside and heaved.

364
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So no Pokemon happened. And that was really it.

365
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
We still haven't started Final Fantasy seven yet.

366
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It's just been Animal Crossing like I'll even tell Dan, hey, why don't we start Final Fantasy?

367
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:33,000
He's like, let me do this Animal Crossing first. And then before you know it, he built Teacup Park in Animal Crossing.

368
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Did you see Teacup Park? No. Have you collected all the Teacup rides? We only have one.

369
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Oh, I'm sorry. I have three of the four. I'm missing one. Other people have to order them for you.

370
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Yeah, I traded a lighthouse because one of my friends got the yellow lighthouse by default and she was like, I got that one, too.

371
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Well, if you want just a plain white lighthouse, I'm open to giving you one. So I gave me a red and white one.

372
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
OK, cool. I traded for that. And then somebody just gave me a black the black checkerboard one.

373
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So the only teacup ride I need to have all four is like the pastel one. There's like a very pastel looking one.

374
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I have the red and blue one. The like the mostly red bold.

375
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Actually, I don't know which one I have. Maybe I have the pastel. I'll have to let you look at it.

376
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,000
But yeah, Dan. Well, we have. OK, so here's the story. And this is going to lead up to a joke now that we have in our village.

377
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:27,000
So when I moved my orange grove to the south west section under where Dan's little plateau is,

378
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
where he built his house and his redneck kiddie pool and everything.

379
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And so Dan's like, I'm going to build a Disneyland.

380
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I'm like, with what? We only have teacups. Like, we'll do it with teacups.

381
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So he uproots all of the orange trees and moves them around and builds Teacup Park.

382
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And that's where I made that little QR sign that I like to do so that we can sign for Teacup Park.

383
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
So and Marissa gave me lights. I have green lights. We're doing all this crap to it.

384
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
It looks great and everything. And of course, Dan has it roped off because, you know, Disneyland is closed down.

385
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So earlier today, he was like, yeah, we have all these sections.

386
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
So you built Teacup Park for nobody to visit? Well, you can look at it.

387
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It's not on. That sounds like that South Park episode where Cartman buys the amusement park so no one else can go to it but him.

388
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Yeah, well, that's that's Teacup Park. So anyway, Dan's like talking about all the places that we have in in our island because I built this.

389
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I built a Japanese cemetery, sea goth.

390
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I moved all of my non-native fruit to, you know, a little four by four orchard.

391
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I made like a little botanical garden with all of the flowers I have any idea what the fuck to do with.

392
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:51,000
You know, I've got like the the the flower garden, you know, the breeding area for my flowers.

393
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:59,000
We have the town center. Dan has his house in Redneck Land. And then he says, and then we have Anaheim.

394
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Is he uprooted the orange trees to build a theme park? Yes. Perfect. Perfect.

395
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
So so now it's just called Anaheim, apparently. You'll have to rename your town.

396
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I'm not renaming my town. I know. All right. Anything else?

397
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I wouldn't rename it Anaheim anyway. All right. Anything else for your gaming week?

398
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
No, but now you all know the story of Anaheim and Animal Crossing of Teacup Park, which you're not allowed to visit.

399
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Teacup Park, which you can look at, you can go in the park, you can sit on the things you can buy popcorn.

400
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And because we couldn't get of course, there's not a churro machine and the teacups are all sealed off.

401
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
So no, no turning on teacups. It's just there. We even have like the little rope going across it. It looks really good.

402
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,000
It's pretty. I've been doing a similar ish thing. Like I have two gardens basically in my village right now.

403
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I think I've changed. I remember the last time he came to smush land, but I've changed a little bit.

404
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
So like one like on one raised cliff, I didn't terraform a lot. I was more like I'm going to work with what I've got.

405
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:07,000
So on one raised cliff, I built like a Zen garden. So I have things like the stone archway, the Japanese headstone,

406
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
the fountains, the very beautiful like fountains, the deer scare, things like that.

407
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
And I have a lot of like my five by five, you know, the guides online that show you how to,

408
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
which I know isn't is apparently now not the best way to do the breeding of the flowers.

409
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:29,000
But I, you know, I've invested enough to find the rare flower island, getting other people to water your flowers.

410
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Yes. Yes. That is a big one. And by the way, I did make my my whole bamboo forest Zen garden thing myself.

411
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:44,000
The only thing that ticks me off is that every time I go and I make sure I've watered every plant and I've like destroyed one or two watering cans doing it,

412
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:51,000
it inevitably rains an hour later. I always want to scream. Anyway, I did that in one area.

413
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And then I have another area that's my more modern park that's a little more inspired by like a Central Park or something.

414
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And that's where I put my teacups. And I have like the jungle gym thing is there.

415
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And I put the big monster Godzilla there because it looks and I put like the metro clock.

416
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
So it looks a little more like a modern ish kind of theme park in that area.

417
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
So I have like my my relaxing park and my loud park. That makes sense.

418
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
It does. Yeah. So that's kind of that's what I've been doing with Smoosh Smoosh Land anyway.

419
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I'm just trying to lure Wisp into my cemetery so I can get a screenshot with him there.

420
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Oh, look at you, goth. All right. Anyway.

421
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Loki, before I before I go on an Animal Crossing tangent, Loki, how was your gaming week?

422
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
My week was all right. I played mostly in let's see, Earth Defense Force Iron Rain.

423
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:48,000
So I'm like up through Mission 36 on that, I think. And that's been pretty fun.

424
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,000
It's a very pretty game, except the A.I. for the your teammates is absolutely garbage.

425
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Like it's I don't know how it's possible that it's actually worse than any other game that I've seen in in that series or ever.

426
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Or even like if I were to make up A.I. for like something like having never built A.I. whatsoever,

427
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I still think it would have been better than that because they literally they'll be these giant bugs coming in instead of shooting them.

428
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
They are literally turned around 180 degrees shooting the ground or like that.

429
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
You keep hearing them. There's these towers in the game that you're not supposed to attack.

430
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
If you attack them, then they send out a burst of energy that attacks things around it and they keep saying,

431
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:42,000
well, stop shooting the tower. And meanwhile, they're just shooting the tower, just constantly shooting the tower.

432
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
It's funny just because how how useless they are.

433
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:53,000
But like to the point where it's just like you release this game, you thought this was OK, because it's not.

434
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Thankfully, though, the excuse in the game is that you're like the super soldier.

435
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And so you're like a one man army anyways. And so, I mean, they're just there to be decorations.

436
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Basically, you do all the work. So, yeah. So I've been enjoying that a lot.

437
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,000
But it is just really weird, though. Otherwise, the game is pretty awesome and looks great.

438
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And then, of course, I've been playing Orna. They just put out a really big patch on that.

439
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
So it looks quite a bit different now. I got a new ornate drop.

440
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
So I have a really high quality weapon now that I'm leveling up.

441
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,000
That's going to do 200 or has 200 points of attack more than my current weapon once I level out of the way up.

442
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,000
And yeah, I've just been mainly playing those two games, a little bit of set mania as well.

443
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
So I'm playing that and that's about it.

444
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Yeah, I was kind of taken by surprise what a big update Orna got this week.

445
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Like it's now that map, you can turn the map any which way, which is kind of cool.

446
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Yeah, you used to be able to do that if you opted in for the beta features.

447
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
So they've had that for a while now.

448
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I didn't like the beta map because I couldn't see as much. I didn't learn about the rotating thing till later.

449
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
So whatever. It's cool now. Yeah.

450
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Yeah. So but I just the capturing a region interface I don't like.

451
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I think they tried to make it more complicated so that people couldn't do the drive by captures as easy, which I understand.

452
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:23,000
You don't want people to play when they're driving. But I've I've definitely I've definitely played when Alan is driving.

453
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And so I'm a little sad that that isn't as easy. Yeah, it was kind of fun.

454
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Yeah, we'll do that. But whatever.

455
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:38,000
All right. Jamie, do you still have Orna installed? You should fire it up sometime because your player is still showing on my house.

456
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I I do. Hold on. I'll just open it right now. I haven't looked at it in an age.

457
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
You probably you'll probably gain like 100 levels from all the XP we've been giving you.

458
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Thank you guys for doing all the work for me. Yeah. Yeah. Right. All right. Anyway, so let's see.

459
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
My gaming week then. What else have I been playing? I've been playing a bit of Animal Crossing as well.

460
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
You know, trying to play the turnip market and all that and doing some of the things on my island that I talked about already.

461
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I won't repeat that too much. I also played and beat.

462
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Thank you very much. The Final Fantasy 7 remake. So it's not often that I play a game start to finish.

463
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
So I think this is a notable occasion that I actually finished the Final Fantasy 7 remake.

464
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
There is so, so much I want to talk about, but I'm not going to be the one that spoils it.

465
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Don't worry. So I'm not going to get into that here.

466
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I'm I like want to do a spoiler cast with some other friends who have beaten the game or already know the ending or what have you.

467
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:38,000
So that we can talk about it because it's it's something that's I can't I can't say that's that's what it is.

468
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
But I want to play. That's the game I do need to go and play.

469
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Like I've been seeing like video clips online of like some of the mini games and stuff.

470
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
And I really do need to finish that. Yeah. They have a cool darts mini game pretty early on.

471
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,000
They have the squats and the pull ups like, you know, a lot of things that are kind of inspired by the original, of course, Final Fantasy 7.

472
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Of course it is. So again, my thoughts and things on the game haven't changed a lot since last week.

473
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:09,000
So I'm not going to go off for an hour about Final Fantasy 7 again. I'm just going to say I'm satisfied completely with the remake.

474
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I believe that I understand the ending. I believe I completely see what they're trying to do with it.

475
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And I am such a fan. Like I it was one of those like, what? What?

476
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,000
So that anyway. Yeah. That's why I was. Yeah. I'm so, so happy with what they did with it.

477
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I don't think everybody's going to be. But I was just like, it's incredible.

478
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:41,000
So, yeah, looking forward to seeing what comes next. So we'll see if they announce something at E3.

479
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I'm using my Cody fingers or what they're going to do if we're gonna have to wait another year.

480
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I don't know what happens now, but I enjoyed my 32 hours with the game that it took me from start to finish doing pretty much all the side quests that I could access,

481
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
because you intentionally can't access every single side quest until you go back through the game later on.

482
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:05,000
There's a particular chapter where you end up going this way or that way and you can go the other way when you go back through later on.

483
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,000
So that's all I'm going to say on the Final Fantasy 7 remake or else I'll spoil it.

484
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:19,000
So other things I want to talk about. I've been playing, of course, continuing on Final Fantasy 14 because I always play that game.

485
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Trying to do more of the crafting and gathering. That's a section of the game I've been ignoring for a little while.

486
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:31,000
But thanks to, I was reminded that Diadem was redone for gathering in this latest patch, so I was checking that out.

487
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Gathering is a nice little relaxing thing to do. I can do that on one monitor and watch somebody on Twitch on the other monitor, so that's cool.

488
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And then I've been playing a lot of random stuff on Xbox, thanks to Xbox Game Pass.

489
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,000
A couple games I've played before, actually, that I just wanted to re-experience on Xbox.

490
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Like Dead Cells, I'd played that a little bit on Switch, and so I ended up playing it on Game Pass on Xbox a little bit, because it's on Game Pass.

491
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Wizard of Lore, shoot, I forget the name of the game, but I'd also played that on Switch a little bit.

492
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,000
And it's a roguelike, I guess, slash Diablo type of game.

493
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Wizard of Legend, that's the name, I didn't even have to look it up. Wizard of Legend, I just took a minute for the name to come to me.

494
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I was playing a little bit of that as well, so I've just been enjoying, yeah, those games.

495
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
So I'm hoping they're going to add even more to Game Pass in the coming weeks.

496
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I need to go back and finish Nier, that's on my list of things to do, because that totally got derailed by my Final Fantasy VII play.

497
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
But now I'm also in the mindset where I'm like, I really want to play XII again, I want to play XIII again,

498
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:41,000
because we had that talk last week about how Final Fantasy VII Remake has a lot in common with Final Fantasy XIII.

499
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I kind of want to go back and experience that again, but yeah, we'll see, whenever they get all that on Game Pass.

500
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
But otherwise, that is about it for my gaming week.

501
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I also play a little bit of the game we're going to talk about here at the top of the show in the next news article,

502
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
so I'll save my thoughts until we get to that.

503
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Otherwise, I guess we should get into some news. I don't have a lot of housekeeping right now.

504
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
We're still going to continue to do this show distance-wise.

505
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:11,000
How long? I don't know. I realize some states are starting to reopen a little bit,

506
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:18,000
but California is not one of them, and I'm pretty sure I can speak safely for everyone when I say,

507
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
we're going to listen to our governor, because our governor is listening to science,

508
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
and so when he says it's okay, I'll trust that.

509
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Other ones, I'm not so sure I trust as much, but you do what works best for y'all.

510
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,000
But as far as OLR being in the same room, we'll do it when our science listening to governor says it's okay.

511
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I don't think they're doing what's best for them at all anyway.

512
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
What do you mean? Here in this state or other places?

513
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Not here in California, but just having talked to my mother.

514
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Oh, for sure.

515
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I'm not doing what's best for them.

516
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Anyhow, let's move on and talk about some gaming news. Let's get into our first story tonight. Loki.

517
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
So this was a big update this week.

518
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,000
So Super Mario Maker 2 was given its last update called World Maker,

519
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
and World Maker added a bunch of things to the game,

520
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,000
but namely the biggest being the ability to create your own Super Mario worlds.

521
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
So you actually get to create the overworld, much like you would see in Super Mario World.

522
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:30,000
You could add up to, I believe, eight levels and a total of 40 stages in there,

523
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:37,000
and all sorts of fun stuff, even like the toad houses, pipes, you name it.

524
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Aside from that, though, they did add a few more things, including, I believe, the rest of the Koopa Kids.

525
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:52,000
They added a Super Mario Brothers 2 mushroom in there, different head blocks, and a bunch of other stuff.

526
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I think the Mecha Koopas, I don't remember what they're called, but yeah, lots of stuff.

527
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
So definitely worth checking out. It's a free update. It looks pretty cool.

528
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I'm really curious to see what people are going to make with this.

529
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
So I actually jumped in there and played a little bit of Mario Maker 2.

530
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
That was the game I was referencing earlier.

531
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I played a little bit of it because I heard about this update, and I ended up playing some Rando's World.

532
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
So you can go into the course bot or whatever it's called,

533
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
and there's a section where you can just kind of explore different worlds.

534
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
You just go in and it shows you random people's worlds.

535
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,000
And I just picked some person at random, and you have a little world map,

536
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,000
and it's basically like they've strung their courses together to make a map and a full game, if you will.

537
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
So I think that's pretty rad. I think it's a nice little bookend on things.

538
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Yeah, I think it's pretty cool.

539
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I have not yet played a level that had the Mario 2 stuff.

540
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I thought that was a pretty bold thing for them to put in as well.

541
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Which is not a full Mario 2 Maker. I don't want people to get the wrong idea.

542
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,000
But there's the whole mushroom that lets Mario pick up monsters like he was Mario 2 Mario.

543
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I'm curious because you know how you can play four player multiplayer in that,

544
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
and each person's Toad or Luigi and stuff like that.

545
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I wonder if they have the physics of those characters with that mushroom.

546
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I would doubt it because it would break the balance of those levels,

547
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
but I don't know. I haven't tested it myself, but I'm assuming no.

548
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
But yeah, I want to get in there and play with some of the Mario 2 mechanics.

549
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I like it every time that Mario Maker adds a new mechanic,

550
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
because people think of ways to use that mechanic in all these different ways.

551
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Like the key and door thing. They do all these weird things with that, you know?

552
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Oh yeah, that's right. They also have that whole thing with the key and the...

553
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I forget what it was from Mario 2. The master attacks you when you take the key.

554
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Oh, the phantos. Yeah.

555
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Yeah, phantos. So that's pretty cool.

556
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I am a little disappointed with all the cool stuff that they've added to it,

557
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
and I understand that they can't support the game forever.

558
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
That this is the last update, because it's like, oh man, look at all this cool stuff.

559
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I was hoping it would be more like Mario 2 stuff,

560
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,000
or even it would be cool if you could get Samus' powers and stuff.

561
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,000
You know, do some cool things with that, like link.

562
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Well, you can't say they haven't provided a lot of content beyond the original game.

563
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
They've done a lot, but it makes me want more, that's all.

564
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Of course. The gamer is never satisfied, we want more.

565
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
But maybe they'll plan on doing a Mario Maker 3?

566
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Or maybe they'll expand the Mario Maker concept into one of their other franchises?

567
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I mean, after all, Link's Awakening kind of had that dungeon build.

568
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Yes, it was a dungeon builder, but it was a thought.

569
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,000
It was a thought, but it wasn't fully realized in Mario Maker 2 that it was in that game.

570
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
For sure.

571
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Dark Tetsuya says, yes, or NES Remix 3.

572
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Orange Right says, it was the last free update, but then says, nah, that was probably it.

573
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
But that is true, they said the last free update.

574
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Bobby Black Wolf says, Super Mario crossover, come on Nintendo, do it.

575
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Yeah, that would be awesome. And I would all be about an NES Remix 3 or some type of user remix.

576
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
You remix.

577
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Oh my god, can you imagine, as a fanboy for a second, can you imagine NES Remix?

578
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
NES Remix was the new Mario Maker game?

579
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Oh, I would, oh, oh.

580
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
It's so good, yeah, I would love that, I would love that.

581
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:34,000
That's a franchise I just want to see come back as NES Remix, or Super Nintendo Remix, or whatever they want to do.

582
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I would love that, but we'll see, we're kind of at Nintendo's mercy, I suppose, in that department.

583
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Alright, well, moving on to another game that got a big update this week.

584
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:49,000
It's one we've already talked about earlier in the show, but Animal Crossing, we didn't really talk about the update, we didn't really focus on that.

585
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Animal Crossing got a pretty big update this week, right?

586
00:49:52,000 --> 00:50:00,000
We saw that there was a museum upgrade that happened, that Red came in, and now I've already bought one piece of fake artwork from him, that little bastard.

587
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
And nerfing.

588
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Yeah, there was a lot of nerfing, the bugs got nerfed, the spawn of tarantulas and stuff got nerfed, right?

589
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:15,000
The bank interest took a nerf, but here, have a free mat to make up for it.

590
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
So a leaf showed up, which is cool, because they added the bushes, right?

591
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:25,000
So that's like a totally new thing for, at least New Horizons, to have the bushes in there.

592
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
And there's different types.

593
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
It was a new leaf.

594
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Yeah, it wasn't the last game, but it wasn't in New Horizons yet, but now it is.

595
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And everybody had the azalea bushes, but then the second bush was kind of, like, I had tea olive ones.

596
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
And then, like, I know my friend had holly bushes, and so there's different bushes.

597
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I'm missing the holly.

598
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Oh.

599
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
So I need holly if anyone has any.

600
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
They're gone? How do you, the bushes don't reproduce?

601
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
You buy them up.

602
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Yeah.

603
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Like, bulk of everywhere that I was.

604
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:05,000
See, you can come dig up a holly bush, but I want to keep my others that I have.

605
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
So hopefully, leaf comes back.

606
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
He should, though.

607
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
He shows up several times, right?

608
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
But he's just not there every day, right?

609
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
All right, anyway.

610
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Yeah, he comes at random.

611
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:29,000
What is notable about this update is that an earlier data mining that happened a couple days before actually spoiled, shall we say, some of what happened in this update.

612
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And the interesting thing is there were things in this data mine that wasn't in the update that could indicate that there are other updates coming.

613
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:45,000
One of them would include a museum café that could somehow incorporate the gyroids, because that isn't really in the game.

614
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,000
The only time you ever see a gyroid is when you're building a bridge or a ramp or something.

615
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Yeah, I was going to ask if those are back in the game.

616
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Not yet, but now we've seen Nintendo fully plans to patch this game, too, to add new stuff.

617
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:09,000
So it'll be, and that's kind of interesting, too, because, you know, I think we're getting right around the time where a lot of people, especially if you're playing the stock market, are paying off their loans.

618
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
So there might be less and less incentive for people to check in the game.

619
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:24,000
But if they kind of drip feed some of this extra stuff, like the art wing and the bushes and maybe the café and the gyroids in the future, it's going to give people a reason to keep going and keep checking in on the game, which I think is very interesting.

620
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Let's see. There's going to be vegetables, apparently, in a later update. They're saying tomato, wheat, sugar cane, potato, carrot, and pumpkin.

621
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Apparently something with a seafood critterpedia page that indicates that at some point you may be able to actually sea dive, which I think that would be brand new for Animal Crossing, right?

622
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I don't think we've ever had that in an Animal Crossing game where you'd actually sea dive.

623
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
We have.

624
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Oh, have we?

625
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Yes, we have.

626
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
What was it?

627
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
It was a new leaf.

628
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Oh, what did you do? I don't remember it at all. Was it just...

629
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Yeah, you would see a little dark shadow or something and you would be able to dive for it to get certain clams and things. It's been a while since I've played new leaf.

630
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Yeah.

631
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
But I mean, yeah, it was in there as of the last game.

632
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:19,000
So that's some interesting things to look forward to for sure. I think that's especially the vegetable stuff because I know some people have been missing some of the other.

633
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I'm not seeing in the data mine or whatever, I'm not seeing anything about bananas or some of the islands, the durians and some of the fruit that was more native to islands.

634
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I'm not seeing that that is coming over yet, but maybe that'll come much later. Who knows?

635
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
There's still plenty of months that they're probably going to continue to support this.

636
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I mean, heck, how long ago was Mario Maker 2 released? That's about a year old at this point, right?

637
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:48,000
So I think we can fully expect that Animal Crossing will probably get regular updates for about a year.

638
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Yeah, it was like last June.

639
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Yeah, last June. It was right before last E3, I think, when they released that.

640
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:58,000
And then I think Splatoon 2 is very similar where they got regular updates for about a year.

641
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
So hopefully we'll be seeing that sort of thing in Animal Crossing for quite some time.

642
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, yeah, Leaf needs to come back so I can sell off my weeds.

643
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Dark Tetsuya says, Rob, the trick is to look up the piece you're buying online to make sure it's the real deal.

644
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I do know that, but I don't always know the name of the painting. I'm not an art history student.

645
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I guess I could Google image search or something, but I kind of just have to go, does this look right?

646
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I've heard some of them are very obvious.

647
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:34,000
My friend got a David statue in his town that was very fake because what David was holding was something completely different.

648
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:41,000
But I think some of them are harder to spot than others if you don't have a rich knowledge of art, which I'm going to fully admit I don't.

649
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:47,000
So I know a lot of useless pop culture shit, but I don't necessarily know my art history.

650
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
If there was a way I could know the names of the paintings and Google them.

651
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I'm sure there's probably an online reference somewhere. That's just why I need to look up.

652
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
There's probably just a website out there that's like, here are all the Animal Crossing paintings and how to spot if it's a fake.

653
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,000
And that's probably just what I need to use, I suppose. Cheat. That's what I need to do.

654
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I need to cheat. Use my references.

655
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Well, no, in that case, something like that isn't cheating. I mean, for me, I took how much art history and I even still need to look a few of them up.

656
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I go, bitch, that's wrong. And others are like, is that did he wear a hat?

657
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Yeah, exactly. I need to teach Siri to understand whether or not those name paintings are fake or not.

658
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Hey, Siri, is this a fake painting or not?

659
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Amo three eighty seven in our chat says there are a couple where literally a hand is in a slightly different position and stuff.

660
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Yeah, that's the stuff. That's what worries me is that some of them are going to be like really like slightly different.

661
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,000
And that's the stuff I'm definitely not going to be able to spot, like David holding something completely different in his hand.

662
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I might be able to recognize that, but like some of these other paintings, I don't know so much about that.

663
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:01,000
And then Bobby Blackwell says it's an open book test. I like that. Yes, it is an open book test.

664
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
And Amo three eighty seven says there is a list. I shared it in different Facebook groups and discords.

665
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I'm in LOL. I'm sure I'm sure just like that, a flower crossbreeding guide, it's spreading like wildfire.

666
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Well, and don't forget, some of us have the guide on order. Dan got it for me for my birthday.

667
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Oh, yeah, the official guide, right? Yeah, it should be. It ships, I think, on the 30th.

668
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:29,000
But would the official guide cover this because it's in a patch? It might not cover the painting.

669
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Why not? Because since it's a sponsored strategy guide, I would think they'd have all that stuff ready to go for print.

670
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I wonder if the strategy guide might give away some other stuff coming in the future then. Who knows?

671
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
All right. Well, there you go. There's there's your other Animal Crossing update for this episode.

672
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
But I know tons and tons of people are living their lives in Animal Crossing right now.

673
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,000
And I can't say I blame you. All right. Moving on. Dark Sakura.

674
00:56:53,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Well, we had brought up earlier about just how video games were starting to go more digital, have more events.

675
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
We had that concert. We had other things going on.

676
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:15,000
But digital video games hit a record by 10 billion sales in March,

677
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:21,000
which I'm pretty sure some of those Animal Crossing people were involved in that and the Doom peoples.

678
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:35,000
So basically, it went from 883 million in February to 1.5 billion in March.

679
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:43,000
So basically, PC games actually climbed 56% in sales.

680
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:49,000
So it was, of course, widespread over Europe and North America for the most part.

681
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:55,000
They're looking really for reliable ways of getting the games or they don't have to leave the house.

682
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Nintendo sold five million copies of Animal Crossing New Horizons in March.

683
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:08,000
And it set a sales record for the most units of a digital console game sold in a single month.

684
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
That's pretty impressive.

685
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Mobile games rose 15%.

686
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:23,000
So most mobile games for the month of March was $5.7 billion.

687
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Pokemon Go saw its revenue jump 18% in March after Niantic changed the leveling rules so you don't have to be out of the house.

688
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I'm actually kind of surprised by that.

689
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I would have thought Niantic was doing that to kind of keep that game hanging on and yet it's actually having the effect where more people...

690
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
That's fascinating to me, actually.

691
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I'm kind of with Jason in the intro to tonight's show.

692
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
A lot of this news isn't necessarily surprising because, of course, we're all stuck at home.

693
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Of course, we're buying more games digitally.

694
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,000
But when you hear things like that, that is surprising to me.

695
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I don't really know. I really wasn't super surprised by it. I really was not.

696
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Well, the Pokemon Go one. Wow, yeah.

697
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
No, I'm really not surprised by that either.

698
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:18,000
And this is me incorporating the people who are...

699
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I don't want to say lazy, but people who are lazy.

700
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Who don't go walking around, who don't think about the game because they're not leaving the house.

701
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Or even that, for people who just might have been too busy in everyday life to remember to open up the app.

702
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Now they have time to do this.

703
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,000
And of course, if you're right next to your Pokestop, then yeah, I'll buy some coins.

704
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Get some more of this package stuff here and get some more eggs because I get that free walking stuff every day.

705
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
I'm not super surprised by it at all.

706
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
And let's also throw in that we've got some of the freebie services going on right now.

707
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Stadia is free for two or three months? Two months.

708
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
So free access to Stadia for two months right now.

709
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,000
You've got all the freebies offered up on PlayStation Network.

710
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I grabbed Pac-Man myself. A few other things.

711
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:18,000
They have actually a pretty decent list of just freebie games that look really fun.

712
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Uncharted and Journey were the other two big ones, yeah.

713
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Uncharted is only for PlayStation Plus, I think.

714
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
No, it was at one point.

715
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Because when I looked, it said...

716
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:36,000
It was at one point PlayStation Plus only, but Uncharted and Journey were free for everybody.

717
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I don't know how long. It may be over. I don't know how long.

718
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I think it said through May 4th.

719
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Yeah, chat is confirming. Bob Coffey says,

720
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Uncharted 1 through 3 collection free for everyone.

721
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Uncharted 4 is PSN Plus. There it is. That's the confusion.

722
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
The newest Uncharted is PSN Plus, but you can get the old collection for free.

723
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Gotcha, gotcha.

724
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:06,000
But yeah. So anyway, I think my bit of news was a big duh.

725
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
But at any rate, there you go.

726
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:16,000
We're seeing it actually now as the viable money maker that they thought it was going to be a few years ago.

727
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Even though, yes, I think we're all agreeing.

728
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Jason said in the intro and I said, and you're saying that it is kind of a duh.

729
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I think at the same time, how much of an increase is partially surprising.

730
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:36,000
The types of things like, again, Pokemon Go or just how much Animal Crossing.

731
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I think we all expected the digital games were going to take off in this situation.

732
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,000
But could anyone have predicted that Animal Crossing would sell that much?

733
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
That is huge. Well, you're biased.

734
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:53,000
No, seriously though, I'm paying attention to all of the hype that we saw online.

735
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I mean, and I keep in mind, I am in a few other groups, right?

736
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
But I was seeing just a lot of people who were like,

737
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Hey, I'm really looking forward to Animal Crossing or, you know,

738
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,000
people who I never thought would be Animal Crossing fans.

739
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Like, yeah, I can't wait to come out.

740
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,000
So I guess I wasn't surprised because I had seen so many people talking about it.

741
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
It could just be in the circles that I'm in.

742
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Maybe. And online hype doesn't always translate into dollars either.

743
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Because sometimes, and it might be because the reviews come out before the game does

744
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
and it kind of derails a lot of that hype.

745
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
You know what I mean?

746
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Like No Man's Sky maybe is kind of one that comes to mind.

747
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Although, again, where that game is at now is completely different.

748
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
But anyway, we've talked about that a million times before.

749
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I think also the other question I kind of want to bring up with this

750
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,000
and I think that this article that you've gone over raises this question is,

751
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Is there a permanent change now that's going to come because of this?

752
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:58,000
You know, we've been watching this industry kind of slowly trend towards digital.

753
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
But there's been many of us that have been holding out on it.

754
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
And I don't think suddenly overnight everybody is going to let go.

755
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
And again, just like, and I've said this before on the show,

756
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,000
just like the music industry, just like Blu-rays, CDs, records,

757
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
there's always going to be collectors that want physical media.

758
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
That part will never go away.

759
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:25,000
But as far as our industry as a whole and where the masses, the common players

760
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:29,000
and the casuals are going, do we think that there is maybe permanent change?

761
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
That's going to happen because of this.

762
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Because so many people went digital with Animal Crossing

763
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,000
and because so many people are going digital for the Final Fantasy 7 remake

764
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
and other things that are happening during this time,

765
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:44,000
is that going to have some type of permanent impact once this pandemic?

766
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,000
But I mean, once we come out of the other side of the pandemic, what do you think?

767
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
I think that there's no choice but to move with this.

768
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I really think that there is zero choice but to embrace the new reality.

769
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
This is our reality now.

770
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
We have proven, you know, so many companies just in general,

771
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
and I'm thinking big scope, right?

772
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Like, oh, we can't have our people work from home.

773
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
It's going to be too hard, too expensive, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

774
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
And they're doing just fine.

775
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,000
You know, people are like, oh, I need my physical copy and all the blah, blah, blah.

776
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
They're doing just fine.

777
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
You know, it's viable.

778
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
People are enjoying it.

779
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
And, yeah, there's still people who want their physical copies,

780
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
who wait for it to ship and everything, and that's fine, too.

781
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:36,000
But I actually, you know, me, I'm the big packaging whore.

782
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I love to see the packaging thing that comes in.

783
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I like to see, you know, what designers can do.

784
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
That makes me happy.

785
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
But they're still designing the artwork on the digital copies, too.

786
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
You like your dishes?

787
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,000
You have your dish that came with that one Dreamcast game that you have?

788
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Yes.

789
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
But I'm more talking about, like, artwork and design elements and all of these things.

790
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Sure.

791
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:06,000
And it's just like, and, you know, for me, who had a focus on print media when I was in college,

792
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I've gone digital with my work.

793
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
And I work just as hard as I would have worked doing something for print.

794
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Now I don't have to nail ink fumes.

795
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,000
A very good point from Bobby in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network,

796
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:26,000
who says, I will continue to buy physical as long as possible because my data cap will return once this is all over.

797
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I can't afford the additional bandwidth hit downloading an 85 gig game like Final Fantasy 7 Remake after buying the game.

798
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Right now, I have no data cap.

799
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
That data cap is returning in a few months.

800
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
And you do raise a good point.

801
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
And, you know, I think that's another reason why more people are willing to go digital right now

802
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
because there's that kind of digital free for all.

803
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
But let me ask this question, too.

804
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
We're all assuming the data cap is coming back.

805
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Will it?

806
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:59,000
That leads it back to the other point about companies saying, oh, it was too expensive to let people do this or this way.

807
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:05,000
We'll lose money if we, you know, drop the data cap.

808
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Yet they're still making their money.

809
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Uh-huh.

810
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,000
And I think it's easy to have the knee-jerk reaction of, yes, the data caps will come back.

811
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
And, you know, I tend to agree, yes, the data caps will come back.

812
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:24,000
But now, like, you know, piggybacking on what Jamie's saying, they're going to have a lot harder time holding on to the argument on why the data caps exist in the first place.

813
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:30,000
And you have to look at where are some of the permanent changes to society happening.

814
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
We also have to consider where people live, too.

815
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
That is, yeah, of course, of course.

816
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
You know, for them having a physical, going back to the physical copy thing, that's going to make more sense for them.

817
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
They should have limited prints of it.

818
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
But, I mean.

819
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Nobody's talking about physical going away.

820
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:50,000
But I'm talking about, you know, is digital going to really start to take over the way that the industry has kind of thought it would several years ago.

821
01:06:50,000 --> 01:07:00,000
And even so, as we're also looking into people doing a bit more minimalist living and focusing a bit more on actually what they need to have.

822
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:07,000
And I've seen more people, I have personally talked to people who are like, you know what, I have all of this excess in my house.

823
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:12,000
And now that I'm here 24-7, I didn't realize just how clogged up my home is.

824
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
And donating things and getting rid of things and downsizing.

825
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,000
And I think we're going to see that continue to trend as well.

826
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,000
And that's going to go right into all these physical copies of games where people can afford to do that.

827
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I just think, you know, there may be some type of societal changes that happen when it comes to these data caps in the first place.

828
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:38,000
What I mean by that, let me explain myself, is that like, and I don't like to talk too much about my day job because I like to separate my day life and my night life.

829
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:45,000
But my day job has said that there will probably, like we haven't really done this working at home thing before.

830
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
We obviously kind of had no choice because of the situation.

831
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:54,000
And now they're saying, you know, this will probably be a part of our culture in some shape or form for the foreseeable future.

832
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:00,000
So meaning that because this whole thing happened, it kind of showed that work at home was possible and everybody's able to kind of succeed in it.

833
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
And so it's something they're thinking about working into the culture in the future.

834
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,000
And I'm sure this company I'm at is not the only one that's thinking about that, right?

835
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:14,000
There's probably lots of companies out there that are like, huh, you know, now that we've tried this work at home thing, we might kind of do this a little more in the future.

836
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:23,000
And so that starts this snowball of now there's going to be more demand for Internet and bandwidth and things like that.

837
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:30,000
So it's going to, I think, force some of these Internet companies to, you know, it's going to drive up demand for Internet companies.

838
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:35,000
And if Internet companies are not willing to get rid of the bandwidth on their own, there's going to be more competition that opens up,

839
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:42,000
especially as we start to move into 5G, which did not cause this whole situation, of course.

840
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:47,000
But I've heard that stuff, of course. But we know that that's the technology that things are going in.

841
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:55,000
But, you know, it is certainly a fair point to say, I live in a big city, so that type of stuff is still accessible for me.

842
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:00,000
There's still a lot of rural parts of the nation where the dialogue is going to be very different.

843
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:10,000
And so, sure, for that part, I kind of understand. But I just, I think it is a fair question to say, we're all assuming these data caps are coming back.

844
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,000
But are they going to come back, if they come back, is it going to be the same way we've always known it?

845
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I think there's going to be a lot of pressure kind of pushed back on the companies to do it a little differently next time.

846
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
But we'll see. I mean, we'll see. Anything's possible, I suppose.

847
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Again, I can't tell the future. If I could, I might have done a lot of things different in the early months of 2020.

848
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
I'll put it this way. I don't think we're going to go back to where we were.

849
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
I don't think so either.

850
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I think that change, keeping a lot of the aspects of this, that we are, I think we're going to have to get used to it.

851
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:49,000
And not going more into history, but if you study any epidemiology, especially looking back to the 1918 influenza outbreak,

852
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
the second wave is always worse, and China's already seen it.

853
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:58,000
The quarantine, the shelter in place is not over.

854
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
And theirs went for, what, three years?

855
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:08,000
And we're looking at something that's probably killing more people in light of the medical advancements that we have.

856
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:14,000
So, I think we are looking at this being our new normal.

857
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I think a lot can change in a few months.

858
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,000
And I think five months ago, we had no idea what any of this was.

859
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,000
And so I think it's very, very hard to say what's going to happen five months from now.

860
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I think the answer is we don't know. Nobody knows.

861
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I think, actually, history is a very good teacher.

862
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:38,000
And we are seeing it actively repeating itself right now.

863
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,000
It can be, but I also don't necessarily want to be doom and gloom about it all.

864
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I'm not being doom and gloom. I'm being realistic.

865
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
The same thing happened, and it's happening again right now.

866
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
All right. I'm going to just move on to the next topic.

867
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
So let's move on to our next topic. Loki.

868
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:00,000
All right. I was just going to say, I've been hearing a lot of good things from this Umbrella Corp.

869
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
And I think they have the answer to solving this whole COVID-19 problem.

870
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:09,000
In the meantime, though, we should be concerned about our Nintendo accounts.

871
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:15,000
So if you have a my Nintendo account, you might want to go ahead and turn on that two-step verification,

872
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:24,000
because apparently there's been a breach and about 160,000 accounts have been breached by hackers as well.

873
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Apparently earlier this month, while payment information was not accessed,

874
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:37,000
so they don't have the ability to see your payment, they can make unauthorized purchases with your account.

875
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:46,000
As I've seen some of the comments in there, but so apparently these network IDs were originally connected to the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS.

876
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:59,000
So it's a bit older. So basically, they have decided to disable the login function and reset the passwords of the affected accounts.

877
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
So if you haven't had that happen yet, good luck for you.

878
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,000
But still, good idea to put on that two-factor authentication wherever possible.

879
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:12,000
And that doesn't just necessarily go for your my Nintendo account, but anywhere you can get it.

880
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:20,000
You know, this whole news, like, well, I'm also kind of not surprised because, you know, these types of breaches are always going to happen.

881
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
But there were a couple of elements that surprised me about it.

882
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Number one was that Nintendo has two-factor authentication in the first place.

883
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:32,000
I didn't even know that because, you know, we always kind of joke that Nintendo lags behind in some of the online stuff.

884
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
And I swear they haven't always had it. And I don't know when they rolled it out.

885
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Yeah, I don't remember that either because usually we'd see some sort of story on, like, the blog sites or whatever saying, hey, yeah, they have it.

886
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Because that's what it was with PlayStation Plus and or the PlayStation accounts.

887
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:52,000
And that's when I added it there. But yeah, I don't remember when they would have added this.

888
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Yeah, but I'm glad to know it's there now because I absolutely went and enabled it.

889
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Because it's funny because I was using Nintendo Network as my universal sign in because it was what we used on the Wii U.

890
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:10,000
And it just at the time, the Switch, I don't see anything wrong with it until this whole thing happened.

891
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:16,000
But luckily, so far, knock, knock, I wasn't reset. Like, Nintendo did not reset my account.

892
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:22,000
So I'm assuming I wasn't part of the breach. And I haven't had any problems.

893
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Again, knock on wood. But I went and enabled two-factor authentication right away so that if something does happen, at least they'll have that hurdle to get over, which will be a pretty big one.

894
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
I was also surprised that they're using Google Authenticator.

895
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I did not learn until I was listening to Bobby tonight that you could just load any Google Authenticator thing into Authy, which is the app I use for Discord and Twitch and all that other stuff.

896
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:49,000
So I didn't even know you could roll it all into one app. I thought you had to use Google Authenticator, so there's that.

897
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:56,000
But I thought it was interesting that Nintendo instead of like, because like Sony and Microsoft, they text message you numbers.

898
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:05,000
And I think Apple is very similar as well, where they pop up that number on my iPhone when I try to log into something online.

899
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:10,000
So it's interesting that Nintendo is kind of using a third-party authentication system rather than their own.

900
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:20,000
And I had it on my phone already, and I was like, well, why do I have this? And then I noticed that the account that's stored on there was for Rockstar Social Club.

901
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:26,000
So for Grand Theft Auto, which I haven't played in forever, is where that was.

902
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:33,000
But yeah, most of the other companies have kind of the whole thing where they'll text you a code to get in and that type of thing.

903
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:38,000
And then Steam has its own authenticator built into their app, so that helps too.

904
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Tiger Claw on Chat says, friend codes are just about the most secure system they had. You didn't use friend codes to log in, though.

905
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Friend code was what identified your Nintendo Wii, let's say, because you didn't really log into your Nintendo Wii, and a friend code would identify your Wii.

906
01:14:53,000 --> 01:15:04,000
But nobody could use, because you didn't log into it, nobody could use your Wii to buy your information, unless they physically had your Nintendo Wii.

907
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:11,000
So friend codes were how you identified your Wii to someone else's Wii. It's so funny to say, but you know what I mean.

908
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:18,000
So you didn't really have a log in. Log ins didn't start until they had the Wii U.

909
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:26,000
And then that's when they used the Nintendo Network, and now they have just a unified Nintendo Online system, because they wanted to tie it all together with their mobile phones and all that.

910
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:39,000
If you look at some of the early, early stuff about Nintendo Switch, when they were actually calling it NX, you actually saw some of this Nintendo Online unified system between mobile and Wii U and NX,

911
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:45,000
as they were calling it at the time and so forth, because this was a big deal for Nintendo, was to bring that all together.

912
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:53,000
But anyway, AMO 387 in our chat says you can set up Microsoft with Google Authenticator 2. I didn't know that.

913
01:15:53,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Okay, so I have something where they text message me, and I don't know if that's just through Google or what, but it doesn't use the actual third party authenticator.

914
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:09,000
I prefer that. I mean, I get it that someone could clone your phone or something like that, but I'm like, eh, really?

915
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Yeah, I doubt that anyone would do that, but yeah, I kind of prefer that than having to open another app.

916
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Because a lot of times where they're having me sign in because, oh, we don't recognize this computer, it's always my own computer.

917
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Like, I've used this computer dozens of times to sign in. They're like, well, do you want us to remember this computer?

918
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Yes, please stop asking me to sign into this computer, and then two days later, I don't know this computer.

919
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:39,000
It's like, Jesus Christ, you know, work.

920
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:47,000
All right. Well, anyway, I would strongly, strongly advise that you all enable your two factor authentication on Nintendo if you haven't already.

921
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:53,000
You know, especially if you have any type of credit card information saved on Nintendo, then you double want to do that.

922
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:58,000
If you are the type that uses point cards to do everything, then you kind of at least have that type of security.

923
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:07,000
But I don't know. I still wouldn't want people getting into my account, so I would highly recommend two factor authentication unless there is some legit reason why you can't do it.

924
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Which I can't think of anything off the top of my head, but maybe you don't have a cell phone. I don't know.

925
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:18,000
So, yeah. Yeah, I agree with AMO 387 in chat. Always set up two factor authentication if it's offered. Absolutely.

926
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:23,000
I'm definitely, especially because I have had my crap hacked before, and it's stupid.

927
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Like, Xbox 360 was the biggest example. Many years ago on this show, somebody logged into my account, spent like a hundred bucks on FIFA, and that ticked me off.

928
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:38,000
You know, two factor authentication wasn't really around as much then. But even more recently, I would say my Epic Game Store account was the one that also got hacked.

929
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:45,000
And luckily, I didn't have a credit card. I have not bought anything with a credit card on the Epic Store, and I won't now because it was hacked.

930
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:54,000
But I did find out they have two factor authentication as well, so maybe I feel a little bit safer, but I still think Epic Store should put out those point cards for sure.

931
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:04,000
All right. Anyway, let's move on and talk about kind of a follow-up to something we've been following for the past couple weeks, and it has to do with Nintendo Switch productions.

932
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:09,000
As you guys, of course, know, Nintendo Switches, they're a little hard to find right now.

933
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:17,000
And we've been talking in previous episodes about how some of the COVID issues in Japan were stopping some of the production from happening for a little bit.

934
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Last week, we talked about that they're back on, but we still have like scalpers and robots that buy these things up just as soon as they're available.

935
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,000
So Nintendo is really trying to get that worked out.

936
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Nikkei did an interview with Nintendo saying, we hope suppliers will be responsive to the production increase, but for procurement of some parts, the outlook remains uncertain, and we can't forecast exactly how many Switches can be supplied.

937
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:55,000
But their goal is 10%. According to Nintendo, the company hopes to produce about 10% more units of the Switch series in 2020, up from around 20 million last year.

938
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:04,000
And I did a little double-take when I heard Switch series, and I was like, oh yeah, the Switch Lite and the regular Switch would be a series, because I was like, ooh, are they giving away that there's another one?

939
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:09,000
There might be, but we don't know anything about that yet. So they're talking about the Switch and the Switch Lite.

940
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Obviously, the supply chain is part of the problem here, which probably doesn't surprise people.

941
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:21,000
We know there's been issues with factories because in other countries, they're having to deal with these COVID issues as well and shutting down and so forth.

942
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:27,000
So a lot of that's just kind of snowballed into what's going on now with Nintendo Switch and why they're getting to be a little harder to find.

943
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:37,000
But Nintendo is committing to ramping up productions and has, I guess, signed the deals necessary to increase production. So we'll see.

944
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Again, please don't buy from scalpers and third-party sellers. Unfortunately, I don't think the audience of this show would really do that type of stuff anyway.

945
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:52,000
I think, unfortunately, the reality is we could all form a pact that we're not going to do that sort of thing.

946
01:19:52,000 --> 01:20:03,000
But there's going to be people that just don't know better, who have a lot of disposable money, who are willing to throw a lot of money at these things to make their kids happy.

947
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:15,000
So I don't know if we alone here at OLR can stop it. But urge your friends, urge people, please don't buy from these third-party sellers because it only creates problems for everybody.

948
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,000
But that's all we can really do. All right, moving on, Dark Sakura.

949
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Sorry, I thought I hit my unmute button. I was going to say, but Rob, Karen needs one now. You don't understand.

950
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:32,000
I know. Well, it's not Karen that needs one. It's Karen Jr. that needs one. But anyway.

951
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:41,000
My little Carlisle needs one now. Where's your manager? No. Right? Anyway.

952
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:50,000
My Hannah spelled with a silent C and an extra H. My little Hannah needs a switch right now.

953
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Rob, that's Hannah.

954
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Hannah.

955
01:20:53,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Hannah. Anyway. So going back to Nintendo systems, though, we have systems that are available to people in Japan.

956
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:09,000
So you know what it is? It's Super Famicom.

957
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:23,000
So there is a group called the Japan Retro Game Association who has a buttload of Super Famicom ready to hand out to families with children under 16 who can pay the shipping fees.

958
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:28,000
But basically, you know, those are the most eligible of them. So they have kind of a lottery system open up.

959
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:39,000
It's open until tomorrow in Japan, April 27th, where, you know, you are chosen, you just pay the shipping fees and you get yourself a Super Famicom.

960
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:51,000
It looks like they have 100 units. So I mean, they are some of them are pretty yellow in that classic, you know, Super Famicom, Super Nintendo style.

961
01:21:51,000 --> 01:22:02,000
But, you know, it looks like some of the games that are in here, we have some Final Fantasy 3 and Final Fantasy 2 and some Donkey Kong Country.

962
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:08,000
I'm just trying to look at the picture and get a close up on it. So they're setting some good games with it. I mean, that's really awesome.

963
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:17,000
And of course, I've seen stuff that, you know, would pay, you know, out the nose for over here for classic games, you can get super cheap in Japan.

964
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:29,000
I'm not saying, you know, go run out to the store. But I mean, you got Yahoo! Auction, you have Yahoo! Japan, you've got all kinds of different, you know, ways of having classic games shipped to you.

965
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:38,000
So I think with such a massive log on there too, or shoot, people get an EverDrive for it. Not that I'm saying necessarily play the ROMs, but this is the time to do it.

966
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:47,000
You know, you'd be amazed at everything that you'd have access for and you discovery that kids are going to be able to make for their games.

967
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Well, this is a nice little thing for Karen to get little Skylar and that's spelled S-K-Y-L-A-H-R out of her hair for a little bit.

968
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
She doesn't need to buy the Switch from a third party seller.

969
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Don't forget, Mackenzie wants to play too.

970
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I know. And she can get, for her twins, she can get a Super Famicom because, you know what, kids need to grow up on the classics, right?

971
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:22,000
This is in Japan, so it'd be someone with like one of those kid-a-kid-a names that are like the equivalent of our, kid-a-kid-a means sparkle. It's, you know, one of those.

972
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:28,000
So they call them sparkly names where they don't actually are like a real name. They're just more like something that sounded pretty.

973
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:35,000
So I really am trying to think of what a good millennial Japanese housewife name is.

974
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
It's all good. It's all good.

975
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Yeah. But at any rate, this would be in Japan. So not a bad thing, you know, and quite likely I think it would take better care of the systems and folks over here might so in general.

976
01:23:50,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Yeah. And also to be clear, this is not the Super Famicom mini. This is a legit Super Famicom and, you know, that still plays.

977
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:06,000
You know, we were joking earlier in the show about, you know, consoles that are built like a brick and still run solid.

978
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Super Nintendo is another very good example. And Super Famicom, of course, is another very good example of like, do you know anyone with a broken Super Nintendo?

979
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
I mean, they might look gross as hell.

980
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
It has to be physically broken.

981
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Yeah. You you cannot break those things unless you want to. I mean, like, you know, if I challenged you to break one, you probably could.

982
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:29,000
But I'm saying like those things do not die unless you killed it.

983
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:36,000
They might look ugly because they brown that with that oxygen thing or whatever. But yeah, you are smokers.

984
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Yeah, that too. But yeah, those those things are hard to break. So it's not surprising that there's 100 working Super Famicom. Somebody has a warehouse somewhere.

985
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:49,000
So, wow. You want to know what the number one kirakira name is in Japan?

986
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
What is that?

987
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Caesar. Sisa.

988
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
OK. I didn't. You learn something new.

989
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Number three. Number three is Luvha.

990
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:04,000
AMO 387 talking about the GameCube. The GameCube was great. Someone could break into your house.

991
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:09,000
You can knock them out with your GameCube, call the police and go back to playing Metroid Prime just fine.

992
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Well, it has a handle on it. That's perfect.

993
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:16,000
The GameCube had that convenient little carrying handle so you could just pick it up and flack somebody with it.

994
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,000
I mean, have you ever dropped a GameCube cube on your foot on the corner?

995
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:23,000
No, I did. No. Well, it was running a game and we're still playing still caliber.

996
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:28,000
The GameCube was such a badass little system. It really did not get enough credit.

997
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:33,000
If you didn't mod it, you could just get one of the disk loaders and play all your imports, because I mean, I was playing.

998
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Remember when I decided that I was going to play Dōbutsu no Mori i Plus to try to get better at reading Japanese?

999
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:51,000
I learned very quickly that getting better at reading it and actually understanding all but, you know, I was maybe getting through 75% of the game OK.

1000
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
But I was like, is this someone's name?

1001
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
You know what else I...

1002
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
What is...

1003
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Go ahead.

1004
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Oh, I was just like, and that's how I learned like half of the Japanese names playing that.

1005
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:10,000
You know, you know what I miss about classic consoles are the splash screens when you first boot up the console.

1006
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
And the GameCube had a badass one, that little...

1007
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:20,000
And like people made the most hilarious fucking vines out of that GameCube loading screen.

1008
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:25,000
I'm sure you guys have seen your short, short little parody GameCube loading screens.

1009
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:30,000
And then, of course, the Dreamcast or the original PlayStation. I kind of miss that.

1010
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Consoles don't really have that so much anymore.

1011
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Like, I guess...

1012
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
I guess like the Xbox 360 had that little...

1013
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
But it's not as exciting.

1014
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Nothing is going to beat the OG PlayStation one.

1015
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,000
It's one of my ringtones on my phone. It's actually one of my alarms.

1016
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
I would say...

1017
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,000
And for the record...

1018
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:51,000
I would say the GameCube was actually a little better than the PlayStation.

1019
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
But I loved...

1020
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Like the PlayStation was one of those like theater sound tests you hear before the beginning of the movie.

1021
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
You know, like...

1022
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Like the THX.

1023
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Yeah, the THX.

1024
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
It was totally like the THX thing.

1025
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:10,000
And for the record, if no one knows, Tom Luke's Japanese name is Tanukichi.

1026
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,000
So there you go.

1027
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Do you know what I learned about...

1028
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
And you probably already knew this, but I didn't know this.

1029
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,000
I learned this today about Animal Crossing and the funny localization thing.

1030
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:27,000
The reason why the turnips are the stock market is that the word for turnip and the word for stock are the same.

1031
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I didn't know that.

1032
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Yeah.

1033
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
I never do that until today.

1034
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Of course, to me, they're just stonks.

1035
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Yeah, no, I know.

1036
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
And I was just always like, oh, it's just silly.

1037
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
It's turnips, you know, whatever.

1038
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
It's a silly game.

1039
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Oh, that's clever.

1040
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,000
How about that?

1041
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,000
I actually wasn't really surprised at all.

1042
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Because, you know, the character Cap'n...

1043
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
I was like, oh, he's a Kappa.

1044
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
And that was his name in Japanese.

1045
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:55,000
And to go ahead and let people know, the little indentation on his head is because Kappa have a bowl of water built into their heads.

1046
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:02,000
And the way you defeat a Kappa is to give him a cucumber and he will be thankful and bow and the water will spill out of his head.

1047
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000
He loses his powers.

1048
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
I thought he just had a giant bald spot like me.

1049
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Girl.

1050
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
All right.

1051
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Anyway, let's move on.

1052
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Do you have water sitting on top of your head?

1053
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Are you really a giant?

1054
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Not in the...

1055
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,000
You don't know it?

1056
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
You don't know what's under this hat.

1057
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Anyway, let's move on and let's get into the next story.

1058
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Loki.

1059
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
All right.

1060
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
So this is pretty cool.

1061
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Since we've been talking about the Final Fantasy 7 remake and is obviously one of the bigger games of the first part of this year, it should be not as big surprise that Square Enix has reported that they have shipped 3.5 million copies.

1062
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Oh, I guess that's shipped and sold digitally because now we're including those.

1063
01:28:50,000 --> 01:29:04,000
So that's pretty much as a pretty decent size amount already and kind of hopefully that will be enough to them because I remember like back when they were like Tomb Raider and stuff, they were not so satisfied with the sales of that.

1064
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:10,000
But being that this is something they're kind of lauding, I would imagine that it's good news for them.

1065
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Well, there was an article that was comparing some of the sales and like God of War in the same timeframe was like 3.1 million and that was a huge game.

1066
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:24,000
We just had Jamie talk about Animal Crossing moving 5 million units, although I believe that captured an entire month.

1067
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,000
And this is just capturing three days.

1068
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Yeah, we're not done with the month yet.

1069
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:33,000
But I mean, we don't have to compare like who's got the bigger Wang.

1070
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:39,000
You know, these are both incredibly well sold games in this type of era.

1071
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:46,000
So I feel like it's enough to justify the game's existence and make sure a part two will come.

1072
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Oh, yeah. I'm sure the sequels are going to be coming.

1073
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:56,000
For sure. Because I don't think Final Fantasy 13 sold 3.5 million in the same time frame. Maybe it did. I don't know. I'd have to go back and look.

1074
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,000
And we ended up getting two sequels for that. So, you know, we'll see.

1075
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Yeah, 3.5 million. That's great. That's a great number.

1076
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,000
So, yeah, people people wanted that Final Fantasy 7 remake real bad.

1077
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
That they did for several years.

1078
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:14,000
All right. Well, another game people are wanting real bad apparently is Valorant.

1079
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,000
You know, that's the riot shooter game that's a little bit Overwatch-ish.

1080
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:24,000
We talked a little bit about it on last week's show because we were talking about some of the anti-cheat system and how some of that was controversial.

1081
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Well, this week we're talking a little bit about two different sides of Valorant and some of the problems that Twitch is having because of the beta key handout system.

1082
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:39,000
If you were not aware, one of the ways to get into the Valorant beta is to watch people play it on Twitch for what, like two hours?

1083
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:43,000
And then you can possibly get a beta key. I'm not sure if it's guaranteed or if it's possible.

1084
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Oh, you have to watch at least two hours and I guess then you get the drop or whatever.

1085
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:57,000
But what's happening is that you have these Twitch channels that are streaming Valorant 24-7 but they're not really there playing it.

1086
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Like it's just them sitting there or it's just, you know, maybe somebody running a rerun of an old stream but they're not using the rerun mechanism to do it.

1087
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,000
They're streaming it like it's live. And so they're doing all these like weird things to kind of game the system.

1088
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:20,000
And then of course you have those really shitty people that are doing things like if you go sub for my stream you'll get a better chance at getting a key or something.

1089
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:25,000
I don't know. I don't know what these people are doing. But there's always somebody that's going to try to take advantage of somebody else.

1090
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Please remember you do not have to pay other Twitch streamers anything in order to get a Valorant beta key or really any type of key unless the publisher's official Twitter says something.

1091
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Like I think Blizzard did something like this once where you got a skin when you watch certain people's streams but the official Blizzard account tweeted about it and had a whole thing on what to watch and when.

1092
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:57,000
If the official Riot or Valorant account isn't saying it, it ain't true. So just remember that as you go on your search for a beta key.

1093
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:07,000
ActDeft in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network saying, oh yeah, I heard of this. They're using the video on demand and restreaming it like if it were live. Yeah, that is another thing that people are doing.

1094
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:13,000
But no matter which way you slice it, you know, there's a lot of people doing it legitimately too. Let's not focus on the bad news.

1095
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:16,000
But that is happening. It is an interesting side effect of this mechanism.

1096
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:22,000
But the other interesting side effect of this way of distributing the game is it's getting huge views for Valorant.

1097
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:27,000
And it's one of the top viewed games on Twitch right now, which is a great way to get people talking about your game.

1098
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Valorant is one of the top titles and usually has double what like Fortnite and Grand Theft Auto 5 and so forth have right now.

1099
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:41,000
At least, you know, I know these numbers fluctuate depending on who's streaming and so forth, but it is doing very, very well.

1100
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:45,000
And part of this is really because of, you know, how they're doing it.

1101
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Valorant now also has the title for the most hours watch of a specific game in a single day on Twitch with 34 million.

1102
01:32:52,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Combine this pandemic, we're all stuck at home situation with everybody wants to get a beta key and you got a recipe for why a lot of people are doing this.

1103
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:12,000
And this game is like a legit win if you're like basically incentivizing your people to watch your stream to get something like that.

1104
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
That seems a little ridiculous.

1105
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:21,000
It is, but it's not like they're the first to do it. Like I said, Blizzard has done this type of stuff before as well and many other companies do it.

1106
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,000
And for what it's worth, you know, I'm not going to dog on the game because I haven't played it.

1107
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,000
B, and I'm not going to watch somebody stream for two hours to do it.

1108
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:32,000
I'm going to watch somebody stream for two hours because they're playing something and are a personality that I really enjoy watching.

1109
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:38,000
However, you know, this game will come out of beta at some point and we'll all be able to play it openly.

1110
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:48,000
And maybe I'll check it out then, but I still think it's kind of noteworthy because not every game takes off even doing that with the same level of success.

1111
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:54,000
So it must speak to the strength of this game in particular and what people are drawn to with this game.

1112
01:33:54,000 --> 01:34:04,000
And you know, I will say that the launch of it and the timing of it and when they're doing this is at a pretty good time because it is kind of a competitor in the same space as Overwatch, right?

1113
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:16,000
And Overwatch is kind of in a slow spot right now. Yes, I know they just released Echo, but let's be real, it's kind of a lame duck until Overwatch 2 comes out because that's the big thing we all know Blizzard's really working on.

1114
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:23,000
And I'm sure, you know, when Overwatch 2 comes out, it's going to snatch wigs and break the records on Twitch all over again and all that stuff.

1115
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:27,000
But until then, there's room in the space for something else to kind of sneak up.

1116
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:32,000
So I think that's, you have all these different factors I think as to why Valorant is succeeding.

1117
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:39,000
But one of the biggest things we can ignore is that, you know what, the game is pretty good and people like it well enough.

1118
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:46,000
You could say the exact same thing about like Apex Legends all happened before Fortnite did their 2.0 and all that, right?

1119
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:50,000
So, you know, sometimes it's a good time to strike.

1120
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Questbuster in chat says, it was funny seeing one streamer that had massive Valorant numbers run with drops not enabled as a stream name for a while.

1121
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:05,000
And then their numbers had several tens thousands fewer viewers than they used to have. Wow.

1122
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Hype Mayhem says, I've been watching Valorant for years since it was called Counter Strike Go.

1123
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Oh, I think that's shade. All right, anyhow.

1124
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:20,000
So at some point I'll have to check this game out. I liked Overwatch well enough and I'm willing to check out, you know, some of the competitors and what they bring.

1125
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:26,000
I tried that Paladins for a little bit. That was interesting. And I know our buddy Flaco Jones is a huge fan of that and streams that occasionally.

1126
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:34,000
So, you know, there's room in the pool for multiple shooter games to do well. So good luck to all of you.

1127
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,000
But don't run fake streams just to get more viewers.

1128
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Like that's, you know, look, I'd love to have more viewers and subs here at Vaga Network, but there's lines I'm just not willing to cross.

1129
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:51,000
OK, so we want to be ethical in the way we're doing things. All right.

1130
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Anyhow, let's move on. Let's go to let's go to something more traditional.

1131
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Every week here on Orange Launch Radio, we like to take a look back down memory lane and spotlight one classic game of the week.

1132
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and says, hey, hey, this this system has a pretty cool splash screen and a pretty cool game.

1133
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:14,000
You should be playing on it. So Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

1134
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Well, I think we're about to make active after really happy because it's Kirby's Dreamland.

1135
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Yay, I freaking love this game.

1136
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:33,000
So Kirby's Dreamland is a side scrolling action platformer that was developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy.

1137
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:39,000
It came out in 1992. It is the first Kirby game and the debut of Kirby.

1138
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I am currently surrounded by four, five Kirby's. Six. Six Kirby's right now.

1139
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:52,000
One of them you got me, Rob. Hello?

1140
01:36:52,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Sorry, I used this opportunity to run to the kitchen, but yes, I was like I wasn't getting any feedback, so I was making sure that I was coming through.

1141
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
You're good. I mean, see, this is a camera trick because the camera's not on me, so I don't have to be sitting there.

1142
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,000
So anyway, but yes, I did get you a Kirby when I was in New York. Yes.

1143
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Yes, I love my Kirby pillow. But at any rate, Kirby's Dreamland was developed by none other than Sakurai Masahiro.

1144
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:21,000
He also gave us the Smash series, of course.

1145
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:30,000
So it had so much that was involved in it. It really was quite the dynamic game, I think so.

1146
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:42,000
So moving on with this one, it was considered an action platformer and it had side scrolling, two dimensional levels.

1147
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:49,000
You had your foreground and your main ground and everything. And the way that Kirby rules is by sucking.

1148
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Yeah. So his main method of attack is to inhale enemies and objects.

1149
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:59,000
You know, he's basically every two year old. Don't put that in your in your mouth, except he does.

1150
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:05,000
So so at any rate, and by the way, going back to what Fifth Dream asked, who came first, Kirby or Yoshi?

1151
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:11,000
There was concept for Yoshi Run for Super Mario Brothers 2, so I think Yoshi was conceived first.

1152
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Anyway, going back to Kirby, basically, he would also, you know, to attack other enemies,

1153
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:26,000
he could spit the enemies back out or he could swallow and digest them slowly for 10,000 years.

1154
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Oh, sorry, that's the Sarlacc. Anyway, the other things that he can do is that by sucking in just air,

1155
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:40,000
he can hover and, you know, inflate himself and fly a little bit.

1156
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:48,000
But the only way he can attack is to release that puff of air, which would cancel his flight.

1157
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:54,000
So you kind of think of it like, you know, an air bladder and how fish stay afloat kind of.

1158
01:38:54,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Anyway, the game has five levels and the levels are actually made up of rooms,

1159
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:05,000
which, you know, honestly, pretty novel concept for a platformer.

1160
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:11,000
So each of these different rooms lead Kirby to a different area.

1161
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:15,000
And some of them are doors to hidden places or different pathways.

1162
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:19,000
You can beat the levels in different ways. The doors act as your checkpoints.

1163
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:23,000
So if you if you die in the game, you don't have to restart the level.

1164
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:29,000
You just return to the room that you were in. Excuse me.

1165
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:36,000
You know, and the way, though, that Kirby would suffer damage is if he touches an enemy or a dangerous object,

1166
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:42,000
he'll lose his hit. Depending on the enemy or the object, he would lose more or less.

1167
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,000
If all of them are lost, he falls into a bottomless pit.

1168
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:50,000
And then you lose your life after you start that, you know, that doorpost that you came in.

1169
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:55,000
So, of course, losing losing them all, game over, yada yada.

1170
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:03,000
And Kirby Kirby's Dream Land had very traditional power ups because, you know, in this one,

1171
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:08,000
remember, he didn't have the copy abilities in later games. This was the first one.

1172
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:14,000
So he could pick up different food, like spicy curry, gives fire breath or a mint leaf.

1173
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:20,000
In Japanese version, the sweet potato would get puffs of air rather quickly.

1174
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:27,000
He could let out that losing flight. And then there was the boss levels, you know, so he could obtain the sparkling stars.

1175
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Most bosses would be beaten by, you know, sucking up a projectile or an object to throw back at them.

1176
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Although one of my favorite ones was and actually it's even mentioned in the thing that I'm looking at,

1177
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:48,000
was Kabula, where it's basically a shooter level. So that's pretty cool.

1178
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Yes, I guess says the Japanese name Hoshi no Kage, which is basically Kirby's dream.

1179
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:03,000
So but anyway, or dream of course, I always get a little bit backwards.

1180
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:07,000
But at any rate, you could also accumulate points and get items.

1181
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:11,000
You could get extra lives if you have enough points, but it doesn't have to save functions.

1182
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:18,000
You can't really save your game. You have to start over, you know, old school, no battery backup.

1183
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:25,000
So and yes, I will be getting to all of these facts after. Thank you very much.

1184
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:31,000
So like I said, it was developed by Sakurai Masahiro of HAL Laboratory.

1185
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Kirby was supposed to be a placeholder character.

1186
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:40,000
He couldn't really, you know, they were going to make something a little bit more sophisticated.

1187
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Right. And he was called Popopo and they were going to call the title Twinkle Popo.

1188
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Although it looks like it's Tinkuru Popo, which would be Tinkle Popo.

1189
01:41:51,000 --> 01:42:01,000
So go big. But at any rate, he was named Kirby and the game was renamed Hoshi no Kabi or Kirby of the Stars.

1190
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:08,000
I always you know what? Another thing about Hoshi is it could also I think mean wish.

1191
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:14,000
So I kind of like the double name on it at any rate.

1192
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:25,000
So they decided to make him pink and Miyamoto actually thought he should be yellow, but not Nintendo agreed with Sakurai.

1193
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:33,000
So he has always been pink and a yellow Kirby has denoted the second player when you're doing multiplayer.

1194
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:40,000
So moving forward, music was done by Ishikawa Jun, who has been the regular composer for the Kirby series,

1195
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:45,000
even on the most recent one, Kirby Star Allies, which I need to get my own copy of.

1196
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:51,000
I borrowed Jamie's copy, like indefinitely, and then finally gave it back.

1197
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:59,000
But even some of the songs have been reused, like in Smash Brothers and in the green green stage of Super Smash Brothers Melee.

1198
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:09,000
So it's all over the place. But at any rate, the game has an aggregate score of 62.22 percent on game rankings, nine reviews.

1199
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:16,000
So it's on that ranking alone is 17 best gameplay games with a 62.

1200
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Yeah, I don't know people. That's not a very good score. I mean, but nine reviews, though, Rob.

1201
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Yeah. Who cares? People go to sleep more reviews. Who cares what they think?

1202
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:36,000
But Kirby's Dreamland as of May 20th, 1995, sold one point three million copies and to date over five million copies worldwide.

1203
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:41,000
And honored for having innovations in the platformer genre.

1204
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:52,000
So we do have that. It has basically the game being successful was also attributed somewhat to Iwara Satoru,

1205
01:43:52,000 --> 01:44:03,000
you know, our long lost Nintendo boss who said had a very simple minded passion for creating games and really love this kind of game.

1206
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:07,000
And it was also considered to be a fun yet relaxed game.

1207
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Some people said it was too elementary, but I think those people are wrong. You know, it's meant to be fun.

1208
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Well, I think it being on the Game Boy is a good boost as well,

1209
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:23,000
because, you know, we forget how transformative the Game Boy really was to making portable gaming a thing.

1210
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Portal gaming was really not a huge thing until the Game Boy made it huge.

1211
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
You know what I mean?

1212
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Well, and again, it was the first intro into it. I think it really laid down a great foundation for a series of games.

1213
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:45,000
I mean, I really thought that Star Allies was way fun and it kind of brought back a lot of what I loved about the first game.

1214
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:49,000
But at any rate, we have some bigger games.

1215
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:55,000
So starting at the beginning, the first sequel was Kirby's Adventure for the NES,

1216
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:02,000
which was the first game that introduced power stealing, and I think I've done Kirby's Adventure for a classic game.

1217
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:12,000
We have had spin-offs like Kirby's Air Ride, a pinball game called Kirby's Pinball Land, a golf hybrid called Kirby's Dream Course.

1218
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Kirby's Dream Land had a sequel in 1995 called Kirby's Dream Land 2 that had the coffee mechanic from Kirby's Adventure.

1219
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Kirby's Super Star had a shortened remake of Kirby's Dream Land called Spring Breeze, as I said, beautifully mentioned in chat.

1220
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:34,000
And it did have the coffee ability, and you could summon helpers for co-op.

1221
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:41,000
But it was, of course, missing the Castle Lololo stage and the Kabula boss fight, which the Kabula fight is one of my favorites.

1222
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:46,000
And instead, La La La became the boss for Float Island instead.

1223
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Kirby's Super Star Ultra had an expansion with Revenge of the King, a harder version of Spring Breeze.

1224
01:45:54,000 --> 01:46:00,000
And by the way, you could unlock the hard mode for Kirby's Dream Land, just saying.

1225
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:07,000
So you also have Kirby and King Dedede as characters in Smash Brothers,

1226
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:16,000
and they have their alternate costumes that are monochrome, that look like Game Boy's graphics, and even some of the levels.

1227
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
I was like, it's Whispy Woods!

1228
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
So yeah, there you go.

1229
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:30,000
We have one of, I think, the best games ever, not just a Game Boy game.

1230
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:36,000
This game is classic, and it's classic for a reason, and I probably should have done it a while back,

1231
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,000
but this has been the month for me going, why did I do that game?

1232
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Or did I do that game?

1233
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Yeah, this is you rediscovering all the games you haven't done as Classic Game of the Week.

1234
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,000
So, I mean, I know you've done other Kirby games. You've done several other Kirby games.

1235
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,000
I did Kirby's Adventure.

1236
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Yeah.

1237
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
I think I've only done Kirby's Adventure.

1238
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:54,000
But not this one. Well, there you go. There it is, your Classic Game of the Week.

1239
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Who doesn't love Kirby? Besides Zach Def, we all know he loves Kirby.

1240
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:03,000
And everyone who follows me on Twitter or one of the sacred few on Facebook,

1241
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:10,000
I think I did recently post the first level music.

1242
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Every iteration of it that had ever existed in a game, I think I posted it on my Twitter last night.

1243
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
So, enjoy.

1244
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Now, you said as part of that, one of the original names of that was Tinkle Lolo, was it? Tinkle something?

1245
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:27,000
It's written as Tinkaroo.

1246
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Ah, well-

1247
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,000
But they're saying, they're calling it Twinkle Popo, but it's written Tinkaroo.

1248
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:36,000
It made me think of Tingle, which of course made me think of Loki, which made me think of, and I didn't know this,

1249
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:40,000
did you know there's a Tingle outfit in Animal Crossing?

1250
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
It was in my 80s today.

1251
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Oh, are you talking about the Kappa outfit?

1252
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,000
No, it's like, they call it the Sprite, or what is it called, the Sprite outfit?

1253
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Oh, yeah, the Sprite. Yeah, there's like a pink one and all the other colors.

1254
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:55,000
It's definitely a Tingle outfit. You just need that.

1255
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,000
That's great.

1256
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Anyway, Dark Soccer, I think you have to peace out because of work, right?

1257
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Did you want to do your rapid-fire stories real quick and then say goodbye?

1258
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Yeah, sure, and we also do have a couple of emails, but I'll leave those for you.

1259
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,000
I can read those, yeah.

1260
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Because I'm kind.

1261
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,000
And make sure you empty the trash when you're done.

1262
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Yes, I will not.

1263
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Anyway, the Pokemon company has released Pokemon backgrounds that you can use for your Zoom calls.

1264
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:24,000
There is a Magikarp one, is that a Magikarp one? No, there better be a Mag-

1265
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Yeah, there's a Magikarp one, which I'm going to use.

1266
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:32,000
If it doesn't work on WebEx, you know I'm going to use those two, but at work.

1267
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:36,000
But at any rate, yeah, you can have all kinds of different, neat-looking Pokemon backgrounds.

1268
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:41,000
There's a Mew and Mewtwo and all kinds of stuff. It's really cute.

1269
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:51,000
And then there's also going to be, dun, dun, dun, a new Splatfest, and it is a rematch.

1270
01:48:51,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Splatoon 2 Splatfest is happening in May, and it is, again, mayonnaise versus ketchup.

1271
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Mayonnaise better win, because ketchup is gross.

1272
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Ugh, disagree. Mayonnaise won the first time, which was a travesty, so maybe this is ketchup's chance to take its rightful crown.

1273
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Yeah, but maybe it's the more superior Japanese mayonnaise, which has a bit more vinegar to it.

1274
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Ugh, anyway.

1275
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Oh, come on, Kewpie mayonnaise is amazing.

1276
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:25,000
I will not be playing, because it was gross, because the things you're splatting actually look like ketchup and mayonnaise.

1277
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:29,000
I'm sorry, I'm not going to subject myself to something to be splatted with mayonnaise. That's disgusting.

1278
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Yeah, that's how I feel about ketchup. Ketchup is disgusting.

1279
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Why don't we do, like, barbecue sauce versus mustard?

1280
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Because I don't like mustard.

1281
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
I like them both, so...

1282
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:42,000
You know what we need to do?

1283
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Huh?

1284
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Because I'm thinking of, uh, pancakes. We need peanut butter versus syrup.

1285
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:54,000
I don't know a lot of people to do peanut butter, but it's not... I'm not opposed to that idea.

1286
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
People don't do peanut butter?

1287
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,000
I don't know a lot of people to do peanut butter. It's, like, always syrup.

1288
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Okay, before I go, I have to tell you what my newest food, like, obsession has been, because I eat waffles every morning now.

1289
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Waffle.

1290
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:13,000
I eat waffles. And I have been taking unsalted cream butter...

1291
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Dan! Dan! Dan! Waffle.

1292
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
And drizzling raw honey over it.

1293
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Yum.

1294
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
And it has been a delight. The end.

1295
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
You're welcome. Go eat.

1296
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Alright, Dark Soccer, thank you for being on the show. I mean, you're always here, but I feel like I need to say thank you anyway.

1297
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Do you have any last thoughts for our listeners before you head off to sleeping for work?

1298
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Pray for me. I start back to work tomorrow, and I am apprehensive. Hello?

1299
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Yeah.

1300
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Did I kick myself out?

1301
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,000
No, here, here.

1302
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
No, I accidentally closed my Discord window. I'm like, oh, crap.

1303
01:50:51,000 --> 01:51:03,000
I am... I'm apprehensive, but I think I'm gonna do well, and my doctor is still like, hey, if you need to log off, do so, but then I go into training for a week.

1304
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:11,000
So that means, again, not having to talk a lot, not being on the phone a lot, so I think a couple weeks, I'm making it through the show great today.

1305
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:15,000
I only needed my inhaler once. So, let's take that as a good sign, right?

1306
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Yeah. Well, as you requested, here are some thoughts and prayers.

1307
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Oh, you know what? Thoughts and prayers do jack shit, so just give me money.

1308
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Okay. Maybe. We'll see. Alright. Thank you again, Dark Soccer. We'll see you next week.

1309
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Alright. Love, everybody. Love, EndoPisu, and reject false icons. Bye.

1310
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Bye. Loki, you got some rapid-fire news for us.

1311
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Sure do. So, Red Dead Redemption 2 is gonna be coming to Game Pass, so that's awesome, starting May 7th.

1312
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:50,000
So, if you haven't got a chance to play the game, now you can play the game, at least if you have Xbox.

1313
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,000
That would be me. I am a perfect candidate for this. Thank you.

1314
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:59,000
You are, and you'll probably enjoy it. I don't know. I didn't enjoy as much as Grand Theft Auto,

1315
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:06,000
because there's a lot of simulation stuff in it, like having to eat and sleep and do work and stuff like that.

1316
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:13,000
I'd rather just go shooty-shooty-bang-bang, but, you know, I guess there's games for everybody.

1317
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:18,000
This is where I need to get this on PCs. I can play with a trainer and then not have to do all that stuff.

1318
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
There you go. That's where I need to do it. Now you're talking.

1319
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:29,000
And then WWE 2K is skipping 2020. Apparently, 2K Games is gonna be sharing more details.

1320
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:35,000
I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact that the last one sucked really bad. It was really a buggy piece of crap.

1321
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:41,000
So, I'm sure it's just because of the COVID or something like that and not because it's absolute garbage.

1322
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:45,000
But, we'll see. Nothing will be missed.

1323
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:53,000
All right. Moving on to arcade archives. Do any of you like to download the arcade archive stuff on the Switch?

1324
01:52:53,000 --> 01:53:00,000
I think they have them on PlayStation 4. It's MAME that you pay for, but that makes it legal and okay.

1325
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:06,000
So, downloading arcade ROMs on your Switch so you can take them on the go and PlayStation.

1326
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Then you get trophies and you get to use your good controllers and all that good stuff.

1327
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:16,000
So, there are some new arcade archive games that are coming in April of 2020 this month.

1328
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:20,000
So, I guess they better be out soon because I haven't heard of these games hitting yet.

1329
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:27,000
But, these games include BurgerTime, Burnin' Rubber, Trio the Punch, and Darwin 4078.

1330
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:32,000
You know I'm all about BurgerTime coming out. Maybe this is meaning they're confirmed now to come out in the near future.

1331
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Some other titles you may have forgot that were announced previously that still haven't arrived yet include Sunset Riders by Konami.

1332
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Versus Wrecking Crew was also one of those games that's supposed to be coming.

1333
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Guerrilla War by SNK and there's other stuff too. There's a lot of those arcade archive games if you weren't aware.

1334
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:56,000
So, if you haven't seen them yet, go check it out because soon you get BurgerTime.

1335
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Anyhow, one place that doesn't have arcade archive games yet, but maybe they'll get them, I don't know, is Google Stadia.

1336
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:09,000
Yes, Google Stadia is still a thing and they are giving away that Pro Pack for two months if you weren't aware.

1337
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:12,000
But, if you don't want to keep it, make sure you cancel it.

1338
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:17,000
However, they're about to do a stream and that stream is coming up on April 28th.

1339
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
So, that is what? That's like in two days, right?

1340
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:28,000
So, two days. So, in two days they're going to be doing the stream and the stream will be at 9 o'clock Pacific time, 9 a.m.

1341
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:34,000
and 12 o'clock Eastern time and 5 o'clock or 6 o'clock depending on what time zone you're in overseas.

1342
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:37,000
It is new Stadia Connect. We have no idea what they're going to be announcing in it.

1343
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:41,000
We would theorize that they could have some new exclusive games they're revealing.

1344
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:49,000
My thought is it should be about the time that Google is talking about how non-pro subscribers can get into it.

1345
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Especially in the state of the world that we're in right now, I think there's more people that want to take advantage of it.

1346
01:54:55,000 --> 01:55:04,000
And yes, I know they have that two-month offer, but when do I just get to, without a pro subscription or whatever, fire up my browser and play Stadia?

1347
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:10,000
So, maybe this is going to talk about kind of that future of what Google Stadia looks like. That's my thought anyway.

1348
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:15,000
But we'll see. And of course, some really good games are going to get some eyeballs on it, so we'll see.

1349
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:21,000
I hope they're not just announcing, ooh, we got these games that have been on other platforms for two years.

1350
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:25,000
Because that's what killed the Wii U, y'all, and hopefully Google learned from that.

1351
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Okay, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates. I know things are a little slow right now, but we'll talk about it anyway.

1352
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Loki, what do we have in the U.S.?

1353
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:41,000
There's some stuff coming out. So we have Gears Tactics coming out on PC, moving out on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1354
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Sakura Wars on PlayStation 4, No Runner on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1355
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Telling Lies on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1356
01:55:55,000 --> 01:56:01,000
We have Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered on PC and Xbox One.

1357
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:08,000
And Street Rage 4 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1358
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:14,000
And then there was a digital game I was going to mention as well coming out called Pocket Arcade Story from KeroSoft.

1359
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:20,000
You may remember them from such games as, of course, Game Dev Saga, or Game Dev Story.

1360
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:25,000
So that was a fun little iOS game and Android game. Now that's going to be on the Switch.

1361
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Neat. Going over to Japan, kind of slow on the Nintendo Switch this week.

1362
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:34,000
The only title I see coming out is Moving Out is coming out on the Switch this week.

1363
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Going over to the PlayStation 4, there's not a lot there either.

1364
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:43,000
I guess it's a very slow week over in Japan, probably due to what's going on in the world.

1365
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:48,000
So no real big releases to speak of this week in Japan. How about the UK, Loki?

1366
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:53,000
UK, we've got Sakura Wars coming out on PlayStation 4.

1367
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Moving Out as well on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

1368
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:03,000
I don't think this is coming out, but they still have it listed there.

1369
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Fast and Furious Crossroads, I believe that's probably been delayed.

1370
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Daymare 1998 Black Edition on PlayStation 4.

1371
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:16,000
And a game called Arcade Spirits, which is on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.

1372
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:20,000
And I was trying to look at that because the little icon looks like a little Taito thing or something.

1373
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:30,000
But apparently it is some sort of visual novel set in a world where the 1983 video game market crash never happened.

1374
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Oh, interesting.

1375
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
It's a romantic comedy.

1376
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
It looks interesting.

1377
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Okay. Fascinating.

1378
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Alright, I guess you'd have all this commercial shovelware garbage.

1379
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:47,000
I mean, not to say that stuff doesn't exist today, but that's what really killed the Atari 2600 was, you know, like anybody could make a game for it.

1380
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:53,000
So you had like the Purina dog chow game and like all these like really like crap shovelware type of games.

1381
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:57,000
And that's why Nintendo, when they released in the US, had the seal of quality.

1382
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:01,000
And, you know, it's the crash is very interesting.

1383
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:04,000
And we're getting because of it thrown out the window once the week came out.

1384
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Yeah, right. I'd be very curious, like kind of what their take on it is.

1385
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:12,000
So I'm curious about their narrative on that crash never happening.

1386
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:15,000
I think that's a very clever idea for a game.

1387
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
All right, let's move on to emails.

1388
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Every week you guys send us emails.

1389
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us emails.

1390
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
And we read some of our favorites here on the air.

1391
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
And we do have some emails this week.

1392
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,000
We have a couple of good ones tonight.

1393
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:32,000
I mean, all the emails we get are great, but it's always nice to have some really good talking points in your emails.

1394
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:39,000
So let's get to our first email tonight from Redertainment, who says, hello, peoples, and then links us to an article that he discusses.

1395
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:44,000
This week, World of Warcraft unveiled official controller support for the first time.

1396
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:49,000
I'm curious what people with more MMORPG experience than I feel about this move.

1397
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Could this lead to an expansion of WoW to the consoles or just making the game more accessible to players through methods that they're already familiar with?

1398
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:04,000
I believe Blizzard responded to this on their official forums and insisted it's more about accessibility

1399
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:09,000
and that you're not going to be able to do everything in the game via a controller.

1400
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:13,000
And this is not some type of thing to take on Final Fantasy XIV.

1401
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:17,000
But, I don't know, there's a part of me that kind of says, yeah, right, to a lot of that.

1402
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:24,000
And the fact that maybe they're having to give in a little bit because every other MMO that's out there right now is for PC.

1403
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Even things like Black Desert, which is a pretty big MMO that I haven't personally played a lot of, they exist on consoles as well as PC.

1404
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:40,000
So I think they realize that maybe by having that controller they might be able to lure a few more people into it.

1405
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:45,000
I don't know if WoW is going to feel great with a controller because the game just wasn't designed with that in mind.

1406
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:51,000
I think it's an interesting pivot, but I'll be curious to see what kinds of things they let you do with a controller.

1407
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:57,000
And I'm all for accessibility. I mean, if it's going to let more people play WoW, then I think that is a great thing.

1408
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:00,000
So, yeah, let's see where they go with it.

1409
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Anyway, moving on with Redertainment's email because there's more.

1410
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Also, have you people been experimenting with crafting your own recipes during our time of social isolating?

1411
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:13,000
I've come up with my own cocktail recipe, the Double Ginger Double Martini.

1412
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Ooh, I love ginger drinks. You know, my favorite drink, my absolute favorite drink is a Moscow Mule.

1413
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:23,000
And that's because I love ginger stuff. But it has to be served in the little copper mug to keep it cold.

1414
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:27,000
So, anyway, the Double Ginger Double Martini.

1415
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Two parts vodka or rum, depending on your preference.

1416
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:33,000
One part ginger beer. One part ginger honey syrup.

1417
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Combine the ingredients into a cocktail shaker, shake, then pour into a glass of your choice and stir.

1418
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Because why the fuck not?

1419
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Because Roberts, Rob Roberts, prefers shaken, not stirred. Just saying.

1420
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Finally, thanks again for posting episodes of OLR on Spotify.

1421
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:55,000
You're welcome. Thanks to Spotify for having us and thank you guys for listening.

1422
02:00:55,000 --> 02:01:01,000
And stay care, Redertainment. This message has been brought to you by the Double Ginger Double Martini.

1423
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
Well, it sounds like a very good drink.

1424
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:07,000
So, I will, I don't really keep a lot of alcohol at home.

1425
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:11,000
I have like a little bit of wine. But maybe we can go forth into the world again.

1426
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
I can talk to some of my alcoholic friends.

1427
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:18,000
I keep thinking about every time I go to the store, I'm like, I should grab a bottle of something.

1428
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Right? It's, yeah, I still have like bottles of wine.

1429
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:25,000
I can't open wine because Alan doesn't drink at all.

1430
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:28,000
And I'm not going to get through a bottle of wine by myself. Like, I'm just not.

1431
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Like, I'll pass out by the time I'm halfway through. Anyway.

1432
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Next email. Maaten from Belgium emails us saying,

1433
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Hello, LR. Maaten from Belgium here.

1434
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:43,000
You were talking last week about games to stay fit with during the COVID lockdown.

1435
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
I've been playing a game called Zwift.

1436
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:51,000
It's basically an MMO cycling game in which you ride an indoor bicycle with other people around the world.

1437
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:54,000
You just run the game on your laptop or iOS device.

1438
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:58,000
The game connects via Bluetooth to your indoor trainer setup.

1439
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:04,000
You just use a regular bicycle hooked up to a smart trainer, which sends your power data to the game.

1440
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:14,000
The trainers range anywhere from about $180 for the cheapest to over $1,000 for setups that simulate hills, road surface, et cetera.

1441
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Oh, things that must like vibrate and do resistance. That's interesting.

1442
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:20,000
You can sign up for virtual races or just join a friendly group ride.

1443
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:24,000
The game has chat. Players give each other little thumbs up, encouragements, and so forth.

1444
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:28,000
You see the little flags for players around you that show which country they're from.

1445
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Anyway, it's an extremely fun way to race your friends virtually or to stay fit during lockdown.

1446
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Thought it would be interesting to share.

1447
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Thanks for continuing the shows and stay healthy.

1448
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
All the best. Maaten from Belgium.

1449
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:40,000
That's pretty cool.

1450
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:43,000
Yeah, there was a picture that was attached to this.

1451
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
If you want to look it up, it's called Zwift.

1452
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
So think Zwift but with a Z.

1453
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Yeah, I was looking at it and it looks pretty cool.

1454
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:54,000
I mean, that $180 for the cheap one price tag kind of scares me.

1455
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:58,000
And this might shock you. I don't own a bike.

1456
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:05,000
I used to, but it got stolen when I was in college and I just never replaced it because bike thieves are assholes.

1457
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:10,000
But yeah, I never really picked up another bike, which is kind of a shame because we live in a really good biking town.

1458
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Like they actually have protected bike lanes downtown, which you don't see everywhere,

1459
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:19,000
which means like you have the bike lane and then or like, no, what is it?

1460
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:23,000
The cars are parked. You have the bike lane, then the parked cars.

1461
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:27,000
So that way people like can't hit you in the bike lane. It's kind of fascinating.

1462
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:30,000
So, yeah, I should get a bike.

1463
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Maybe I should put that on my birthday list, but I don't have one.

1464
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:39,000
But this sounds like a neat setup. I like I love the idea of gamifying it and making it a little more virtual.

1465
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:45,000
I'm, you know, also here where we live, we're surrounded by all these river trails.

1466
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:48,000
And so it would be hard to tell me to not bike out.

1467
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:51,000
But I guess transporting a bike can be a pain in the ass.

1468
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:54,000
You have to bike to the trail before you can really get on the bike trail.

1469
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:57,000
But I don't know. People ride a long, long way on those bikes.

1470
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:01,000
But I think that was neat. I think there's a neat little thing that more people should check out.

1471
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:04,000
So Zwift is where you can check that out.

1472
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:11,000
All right. Again, if you want to email us for a future week, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your email.

1473
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
We'll be looking forward to some emails next week.

1474
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:18,000
In the meantime, a few more stories for you guys. Let's go to Loki.

1475
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:27,000
All right. So let's talk a little bit about I swear it's like a constant topic with Nvidia streaming service and what it's losing.

1476
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:33,000
So more games, unfortunately, are being removed from their service starting this week.

1477
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:41,000
So apparently they have lost games from Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment, Xbox Game Studios,

1478
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:49,000
which I mean, that makes sense with their own streaming services, Codemasters and Clay Entertainment.

1479
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:54,000
They're going to they have been removed as of Friday.

1480
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:58,000
So that kind of sucks. So what does Nvidia have left on their streaming service?

1481
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:02,000
I don't know. But see, their streaming service is not necessarily I mean, it's your own library.

1482
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:11,000
So it's basically these companies just saying, hey, yeah, we know that you purchased this stuff already, but we're just not going to let you.

1483
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Well, isn't it more the fact that Nvidia is charging their five dollar a month fee and game companies are, I guess, not are not happy that they're not getting a part of that.

1484
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Although I thought they maybe it came up in a preview because this story's come up a few times now because what Blizzard took their stuff off and, you know, in Activision, of course, a part of that and so on.

1485
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:32,000
So we've got all these game companies that took their games off the service.

1486
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:44,000
And, you know, there's like it came out one of the stories that they actually were getting a share of the profits, but it wasn't enough because people always want more profits.

1487
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Yeah. Well, whatever. You know, I'm sure they'll try to come up with their own game streaming services, and I'm sure no one will do it because it's going to be too spread thin.

1488
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Really what needs to happen is people just need to come up with, there needs to be some sort of independent solution that just does the whole Steam link, but like from afar.

1489
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:11,000
I agree with pod culture in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network who says, how would this be any different from renting a computer?

1490
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Yeah. I mean, they didn't pull their games out of computer cafes. Right.

1491
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:20,000
I know that's a stretch and that isn't really a part of our culture here in the US. Like, I know they exist.

1492
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Well, in this pandemic situation, they don't exist, but they exist. But certainly in like, you know, Korea and some of the Asian market, like computer cafes are very commonplace.

1493
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:39,000
And so, I mean, I guess you also kind of pay for games on a time scale, but it would be weird if like you went to one of these places and you couldn't play games that you've actually bought.

1494
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:47,000
You know what I mean? So I kind of, I think that's a good comparison. You're kind of renting somebody else's computer, right?

1495
02:06:47,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Not necessarily, but like, I get it. I don't know. I just, it doesn't matter to me because I'm like, I'm not going to use the service anyways because I would play on my PC, my laptop and wherever I'm going.

1496
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:13,000
So if I'm going somewhere else, I wouldn't have access to it. I mean, I'm not going to want to try to even play a game, let alone like, you know, playing like order and stuff just drains my battery as it is.

1497
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:21,000
I can't imagine what streaming a game on my phone would even do. It would just, it would like toast that battery.

1498
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:31,000
All right, Bobby Black Wilson chat with the harsh dose of reality who says broadcasting over the internet is the issue. If you rent a computer, it's not broadcasting over the internet to you, but you're still broadcasting it over the internet.

1499
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:39,000
It's not the computer that's the problem. It's the act of broadcasting it over the internet. Even if you're the only viewer, it's still being broadcast to you.

1500
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:52,000
So, I mean, that's essentially what Google Stadia is doing as well. But yes, I mean, Google, that's why not every game is on Google Stadia and it's a different model. Yes, I understand the difference here is because, you know, you're buying those games on Stadia and that's part of the agreement.

1501
02:07:52,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Whereas here, you know, you're trying to play your existing library. So, but I mean, people broadcast tons of games here on this site on Twitch, and you don't necessarily see the kickback. But again, you're not, you're not playing it.

1502
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Oh, I know a good example though. Okay. How about PlayStation 4's SharePlay? Isn't that broadcasting too? And doesn't Sony, like by default, don't all the games on PlayStation 4 have that SharePlay thing going? And that's what you're doing, right?

1503
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:28,000
You're broadcasting to one person, but it's like a privatized environment. You do have to have PlayStation Plus. So, maybe there's some type of money thing going on there.

1504
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Maybe something in the agreements with the game makers for PlayStation 4 are kind of like signed into that. But that is worth acknowledging. SharePlay's kind of a similar setup, right?

1505
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Bobby says, Sony has the broadcast rights. Nvidia does not pay for broadcasting rights and the publishers can turn it off. I suppose, yeah, I do, I will say this, the entire last chapter of Final Fantasy 7 Remake, the broadcasting thing flips off.

1506
02:08:54,000 --> 02:09:06,000
I wasn't broadcasting or anything. But you actually, because you get a screenshot every time you get an achievement, and every time you beat a chapter in the Final Fantasy 7 Remake, you get an achievement, a little trophy pops up, right?

1507
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:17,000
So, the trophy popped up for the last chapter, chapter 17. And then it said, unable to take screenshot, because you know, your PlayStation 4 always takes a screenshot when you get a trophy, because this scene is blocked.

1508
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:32,000
So, I suppose you're right. SharePlay could be blocked as well. I didn't try doing that. Maybe I should try doing that. Anybody beat Final Fantasy 7 that wants to see? I'm assuming it doesn't work. That that's probably part of what goes with it.

1509
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:42,000
And Bobby does say, Atlus goes after streamers who stream too far in Persona 5. Well, that's a bummer. But that is, yeah, that is something that has been in the news before as well.

1510
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:52,000
All right. Moving on. Let's move on to Xbox and some things that they're doing and Series X. And everybody wants to know, where's more games for Series X?

1511
02:09:52,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Because we know Hellblade, As soon as Sacrifice 2, and that whole thing is happening. But I don't think we've had a lot of announcements outside of that.

1512
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:14,000
And in a tweet this week, because that's the way we get news now is on Twitter, Phil Spencer, the head of Xbox, talked about what is happening with Xbox Series X, saying, reviewed plans yesterday for continued sharing through launch.

1513
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Team is doing great work and adapting. I've never been more excited about Xbox plans. We've heard you. You want transparency and authenticity.

1514
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:37,000
We plan to keep showing that way. Next step is not too much of a wait. And then in parentheses, games. So, yeah, it's kind of teasing that we know you want more information and you'll get it soon.

1515
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:50,000
But we don't know when soon is. Although one could certainly theorize, well, in a non-pandemic world where COVID wouldn't have happened, E3 would have happened in June and Microsoft was still planning on participating in that.

1516
02:10:50,000 --> 02:11:00,000
June is not that far away at this point. We're talking less than six or about six weeks, right? So, I mean, is there a plan to just do things during the week E3 would have been?

1517
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Maybe with some of these people that have stepped in to fill in for E3, such as IGN and so forth. What do you think, Logie?

1518
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Either that or around the same time. I'd imagine that any time between now and probably June is when we're going to hear something. So, I don't think it's hard to imagine that that's going to happen.

1519
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:25,000
I don't know if they would necessarily do something through IGN per se, but like I could see them doing their own event around that time.

1520
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:34,000
Yeah, I think that's a good point. They'll probably do their own event, but they might supplement with IGN because IGN will still, you know, they're a media outlet. They're still going to be all about exclusives.

1521
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:45,000
So, if they get, maybe the trailer gets unveiled at a Microsoft event, but then IGN gets, oh, here's the deeper exclusive on Fable 4 first gameplay outside the trailer.

1522
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:54,000
I'm obviously making that up. That's on my wish list of things I would like Microsoft to announce, but let's say that, you know, IGN gets first look at Fable 4 gameplay. They'll still do it as part of their event, right?

1523
02:11:54,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Even though Microsoft might show the trailer at their own thing that they're going to stream on Mixer and, you know, what have you, easily available on Xbox One and so forth.

1524
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:18,000
They've done that even with like E3 stuff where they'll have like the exclusive trailer at the PlayStation event and then, but we're going to get some extended footage or different trailer on the Xbox event or Activision or whatever.

1525
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:30,000
Maybe Microsoft needs their own tree house. Like, cause that's what Nintendo does. They show the trailers in their little 30 minute direct and then, oh, Nintendo tree house for three days will give those deeper dives and so forth.

1526
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
Yeah. We can bring back the space ponchos.

1527
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Hey, I love that E3. The space, the Cirque du Cirque du Connect, that whole thing with the space ponchos. That was rad.

1528
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Man, good times. You know what? What I'd give, what I'd give to be rid of this COVID shit and back into the era of space ponchos when that was the joke. All right. Anyway.

1529
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Uh, moving on, uh, dark soccer had to leave and she was going to talk about this, so I'm probably not going to do this story justice. I apologize in advance, but this was kind of more one of those like human interest stories involving games.

1530
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Uh, a nine year old Italian boy has created a game during this whole lockdown situation because of course, uh, Italy has been going through it a lot of what you're seeing here in the U S you know, Italy had it really bad.

1531
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Uh, those first few weeks when we were just starting some of our shut-ins and lockdowns and so forth. So the folks in Italy had been locked down for some time and a fourth grader has taken this time to actually create a video game to play with friends online.

1532
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:47,000
And again, another reason why I think this is nice to bring up is because it shows that whole art coming from crappy scenarios type of situation.

1533
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:55,000
You know, yes, it is fascinating that a nine year old did this and insert the joke here about how a nine year old finished his game before Loki. It's the easy.

1534
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Yes, but that's because he, he picked something small to do, I'm sure. And, and he's also a nine year old that doesn't have a daytime job.

1535
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Right. But the reality is, is that not only did the nine year old create a game, the nine year old created a game that was kind of about COVID-19 being the backdrop here.

1536
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Uh, the name of the kid is Lupo Da Turi. I hope I said that name right. Sorry if I didn't. Uh, he lives on the outskirts of Milan and of course they've been on lockdown since March 8th there.

1537
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:29,000
And so he said, I had to stop all the sports I did because of COVID-19. I can't even go to the pond with my dog.

1538
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Instead of playing sports, skiing, swimming, karate, I have to make do with an exercise bike. So he did some online tutorials and made a game called Surba 20.

1539
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:50,000
It's a search and destroy type of game and you have lasers, but you're in the captain's chair of the Surba 20 spacecraft and you are fighting COVID-19.

1540
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:59,000
You know, again, the kid is nine. It's fine to have a simple plot for a game. A lot of great games have a simple plot. Go back to anything on the Atari 2600.

1541
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:09,000
Okay. Uh, so Lupo, uh, the, the child Lupo talks out, he's playing with his friends and now wants to do a project on how to teach his friends how to program so they can make their own games.

1542
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Um, he's getting requests from his teachers to program things, not just games. And that's according to his father. That's very fascinating.

1543
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Um, what's interesting, uh, I guess folks, there might still be a negative comment, connotation. If you play a lot of video games, you're a nerd.

1544
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Uh, because his mom, uh, commented, I'm not worried because my son is not a nerd, happy because he's passionate about something that can help him.

1545
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:41,000
The fact that he invented a game that has gone viral makes me happy because it motivates him to do even more.

1546
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:49,000
So, uh, there you go. Uh, a, a COVID-19 commentary piece by a nine-year-old called Serba 20.

1547
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:57,000
Meanwhile, I'm struggling to get out of bed on the weekend. So you gotta, you gotta tip your hat to this kid and, uh, congratulations.

1548
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:05,000
And maybe he'll continue to make awesome video games in the future. If he likes sports, maybe he'll program sports video games when he grows up. Who knows?

1549
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
All right. Anyhow, uh, look, you want us to take the next story.

1550
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:26,000
All right. Um, so you may remember when, uh, Fortnite was released on Android that they went about some way where you have to side load it basically onto your device in order to get around having to put it on the Google Play Store.

1551
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Well, apparently they have decided that after 18 months of being without it, that they're going to go ahead and take part and put it on the Google Play Store.

1552
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:46,000
Um, because apparently, you know, despite the fact that they're not, they're going to lose a third, that 30% cut that Google takes, it's, I guess, better exposure.

1553
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:58,000
So Google put software, uh, downloadable outside of Google Play at a disadvantage through technical and business measures such as a scary repetitive security pop-ups for download and updated software,

1554
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:17,000
restrictive manufacturer and carrier agreements and dealings, Google public relations, characterizing third party software as malware and the new efforts such as Google Play Protect outright block software obtained outside of the Google Play Store is one of the reasons why they felt pressured to put it on there.

1555
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Uh, they said, we hope that Google will revise its policies and business dealings in the near future so that all developers are free to reach and engage in commerce with the customers on Android and Play Store through open services, including payment services that can compete on level playing field.

1556
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:43,000
Well, I'm sorry to tell you that's never going to happen because on the Apple side of the house, you know, there's the whole iOS, um, you know, app store that you can't get around that either.

1557
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:54,000
And the fact that you could get around the Google Play Store at one point was kind of a nice bonus, but they don't have to do that. So yeah.

1558
02:17:54,000 --> 02:18:08,000
And I know, I was just to say, I know Apple takes a lot of crap for things having to go through their store, but at the same time, you know, for the most part, it means the quality is there and you don't have a bunch of, you know, things trying to hijack your phone to mine Bitcoin and things like that.

1559
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:18,000
Not to say it's perfect, you know, things have snuck through the store that probably shouldn't have, but they it's, it's, it's usually in the news and notable each and every time that happens, you know, so there's, there's gives and takes.

1560
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Yeah.

1561
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:30,000
So it's a good, at least to be a little bit more accessible to folks. Um, but I know that's not ideal for them.

1562
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:51,000
It's interesting though, because you would think at this point, like if you haven't tried Fortnite, are you ever going to, so it's interesting that they, I guess, believe that this is going to open it up to more people putting it on their phone, but they must have really seen like, you know, maybe comparing to iOS and so forth. Like people just aren't installing Fortnite on their Google phones, uh, androids the way they would on other platforms, I guess.

1563
02:18:51,000 --> 02:19:17,000
Well, look at, look at your target demo, like is, you know, children playing the game. Do you, I know a lot of children are pretty tech savvy, but even my kids who use technology all the time, they wouldn't know how to do it. I'd have to load that thing on their forum. So, um, I mean, hell, they don't even know what updates are sometimes when they get pop up message on the switch to update software. So it's, it's very understandable.

1564
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:43,000
It's a barrier to entry for some of the more casual players on the platforms and stuff, especially if you're playing a game like Fortnite on a phone or on an Android device like that. I mean, I don't want to categorize someone as more casual doing that, but you know, I would think that the folks that are on a PC are probably a little bit more knowledgeable on how to do stuff. Plus it's definitely a lot more accessible on PC, whereas this was still a barrier to entry.

1565
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:58,000
And with all the popups, you know, and especially if you're a parent and maybe not too tech savvy yourself, you're like, Oh, I don't know. It's telling me that I shouldn't do this. I, I'm very hesitant of wanting to put it on here. So I can see why they want to get around that.

1566
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:13,000
All right. Well, one more story for you guys before we wrap up for the night, and that has to do with Guild Wars. That's right. Guild. I'm not even talking about Guild Wars 2. I'm talking about the original Guild Wars. Did you know that game is about 15 years old? It's celebrating its 15th anniversary.

1567
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:28,000
And right now going on in the game, there is a celebration on Embark beach going on in Guild Wars with 10 new weapons, one for each profession on sale for the anniversary vendor and a new trophy that lets you spawn a boss in one of the four end game location.

1568
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:40,000
The bosses are not new, but they have new skills. They get, I guess, icons from Guild Wars 2. So kind of trying to, you know, I guess bring some of the Guild Wars 2 into the old Guild Wars, just even if only visual.

1569
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:57,000
And obviously a lot of people from the original game have moved on to Guild Wars 2, but you know, part of the reason why people love Guild Wars is that it didn't have a monthly fee. So if you bought it, you can log in right now and play it. If you can remember your login or you still have it installed somewhere and check out the anniversary. So pretty cool.

1570
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:16,000
By the way, if you want to know how popular Guild Wars 2 was, estimated about 1.5 million in 2018. So probably only a fraction of that still on the old school Guild Wars. But I think that is really cool that they are adding some stuff for the anniversary to help people celebrate and acknowledge the game.

1571
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:30,000
You know, why not? Blizzard has World of Warcraft classic and you know, sometimes people like to go experience the old games again, which reminds me, are we ever going to get an update on the future of Final Fantasy 11? I don't think so. I'm starting to think no at this point. It's just done.

1572
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Disappointed. Yeah, a little bit. All right. If you have any questions for us, I'm going to open up the round table in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network.

1573
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:51,000
If you have any questions or general statements for our show tonight, please feel free to ask away over twitch.tv slash vog network. Probably not going to do calls tonight. I'm looking to wrap up here in the next few minutes, but please, if you have any questions, go ahead and ask there.

1574
02:21:51,000 --> 02:22:01,000
And I know Loki probably has a couple of last minute stories that he wants to get to. I think I do. I thought there was at least one or two stories we didn't put on the show tonight.

1575
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:18,000
Uh, sure. Let's take a look here. Uh, I will, let me read some comments from chat to buy you time here. Um, uh, Phoenix 77 26 in our chat says, Rob Guild Wars one had a different skill system to Guild Wars two that many old players think is a lot better.

1576
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:29,000
Yeah. The games did play a little differently. And you know what? Anytime you release a sequel like that, like even when they did EverQuest two, there was still going to be people that are going to be loyalists to the old EverQuest.

1577
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:38,000
And that's why there's not going to be a world of Warcraft two. I bet I would be, I would be very shocked if they ever did a world of Warcraft two. If Blizzard wanted to do another MMO, they'd use one of their other properties or something.

1578
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:54,000
They're not going to make a world of Warcraft two because there's just going to be people that are stuck on World of Warcraft Warcraft. They just, or, or what you see, I guess what you really see happening because this is what's happening at Blizzard is that they evolved the game through so much through its expansions that people long for the way the game they used to be.

1579
02:22:54,000 --> 02:23:01,000
So you have World of Warcraft classic and now World of Warcraft the way the game is now. So it's kind of, I guess, different evolution patterns in that way.

1580
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Phoenix is also asking, do we have any idea on what WoW's current numbers are? No, because Blizzard stopped releasing those numbers because they were slowly going down and down and down and everybody was screaming doom and gloom. So they just stopped putting the numbers out there.

1581
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:26,000
So, um, no, we don't know. And we don't, we don't really know. And when Final Fantasy 14 reports numbers, they only report the number of accounts. They don't really talk about what's active and what's not.

1582
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:40,000
It is assumed right now by some that Final Fantasy 14 is the dominant MMO, but we don't know. Nobody's putting out the numbers to justify it. We just, we have to rely on like third party data that analyzes what people are playing. And otherwise we don't know.

1583
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:49,000
They should have totally done in like an April fool's joke that say that they're going to put out Final Fantasy 14 classic. It's the version one.

1584
02:23:49,000 --> 02:24:03,000
There's, there's people that want that. There's people that are asking for that. And I'm like, okay, if you think World of Warcraft classic is through some Rose colored glasses, then let me tell you, Final Fantasy 14 one sucked ass and you don't want it.

1585
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:16,000
Like you, you think you want it. You don't want it. It's bad. All right. Can we call 14 class or 11, 14 classic and just bring that back? Yeah. Bring 11 back. That's well, 11, 11 tightly hasn't gone anywhere.

1586
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:28,000
It's still there. Uh, just not on PlayStation or Xbox anymore, but it's still cooking along on the PC. So, um, bonds, double six is saying no Pokemon go news. I don't, I don't think they have any major news this week.

1587
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:39,000
Um, I don't know if that's teasing us cause we tend to talk a lot about what's going on in Pokemon, go on the show. Uh, they did, they did a community day. They had the Auburn community. I, I did a little bit of it from home. I didn't catch a single shiny and I was, I was kind of over it.

1588
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:50,000
I haven't played the game in a long time. I just, yeah. Yeah. I guess, I guess their news would be that that community day happened at home. I liked that it was a nice big window to play it though. I wish they were all like that.

1589
02:24:50,000 --> 02:25:00,000
Yeah. So, uh, I was going to mention though, uh, we talked a little bit last week about Corona relief done quick because that was going on while we were recording the show or at least it just about wrapped up.

1590
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:19,000
So they had succeeded in raising over $400,000, um, towards that, um, their charity as well. So that's pretty awesome. I was watching a little bit of the, um, uh, the YouTube clips during the week. So that was pretty cool. Uh, summer games done quick.

1591
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:40,000
Currently scheduled for August 16th through the 23rd. So we'll have to wait and see what happens there. Um, and then this was kind of cool. I saw this mod that was put out for Mario 64 called super Mario Odyssey 64, which basically includes several Mario Odysseys worlds like sand loss in Bowser's kingdom.

1592
02:25:41,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Uh, they have 80 moons in there plus cappy mechanics as well. And the different characters, um, or the different, um, mobs and stuff from the game as well. So, uh, go find that out on the, uh, internets as well. Thankfully, this is one of those cases where, Hey, mods done.

1593
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Now I'm going to talk about it and release it before you can get your C and D. So good times.

1594
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:19,000
A hype mayhem is mentioning in our chat at twitch.tv slash vog network. You forgot to mention that the source code to team fortress two and counter-strike go were leaked and left players open to hacking. If an exploit in the source code is found. I did hear about that.

1595
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:38,000
Yes. And I remember, um, valve had said it wasn't such a big deal because it was really old source code. And so I don't think that anything, um, a lot of the code has changed since then. So they didn't feel that it was going to leave them open to vulnerabilities or anything.

1596
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Yeah. It does seem they're trying to laugh it off and sweep it under the rug, but, uh, I guess, I guess the only way we will find out is if hackers actually succeed in exploiting the game based on what they find in there. So we'll see.

1597
02:26:49,000 --> 02:27:00,000
So, yeah. All right. Well, if that's that, then we're going to go ahead and start to wrap up the show tonight. We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts. Uh, first off, thank you guys so much for listening to our program.

1598
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:09,000
Whether you were here live with us at twitch.tv slash vog network on Sunday night, or you listen to us on the podcast feed throughout the week, however you participated with the show, we really appreciate it.

1599
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Um, tell a friend or two about the show, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice. But, um, if the voices aren't here to put on air, how can we possibly, you know, share more voices?

1600
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:30,000
Uh, auto hosts on things like Twitch go a long way. Let me tell you a nice five star reveal on iTunes or things like that. Also love that as well. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you to everybody that goes the extra mile, uh, with all of that stuff.

1601
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Um, final thought time, Loki, your final thought.

1602
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:49,000
Uh, my final thought is I'd like to work more on my game this week. I did work on a little bit on it, um, but not a whole ton. Um, mainly because I'm switching from computers and everything is kind of put me back behind the things.

1603
02:27:49,000 --> 02:28:05,000
And, um, I was toying with different art styles and stuff and using different tools to build levels. So, um, I found that my importer that I was using for the voxel stuff isn't working quite right. So I've got to kind of redo that.

1604
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:11,000
So that's putting me back a little bit, but, uh, I'm still trying to get in the swing of things and do it on a more regular basis.

1605
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:30,000
All right. Um, my final thought is, um, now that I've beaten Final Fantasy 7 Remake, I need another 30 hour game to play through. I guess I still have Nier and that seems like the one I'm going to gravitate to, but I also know me and I feel like I'm gonna like, it's time to get back on my Final Fantasy 10 bullshit or Final Fantasy 12.

1606
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:39,000
And I'm probably going to go back and revisit one of the classics cause I just know how I am. Uh, and that's probably what I'll end up doing, but we'll see, stay tuned. I'll let you know what happens in seven days. Sound good?

1607
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:56,000
All right. Uh, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Thanks again for tuning in. We will see you next week when we do it all over again. Uh, in the meantime, stay safe, uh, stay indoors, help stop the spread, wash your hands, all that good stuff and, uh, take care of yourselves.

1608
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:03,000
That's really all we can ask and have fun gaming online and all that good stuff. Be nice to other people when you play online. Take care. See you next week.

1609
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:20,000
