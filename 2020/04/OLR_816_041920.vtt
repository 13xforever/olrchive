00:00.000 --> 00:18.240
This week, Facebook makes game streaming a first-year citizen. The ESRB adds new rating

00:18.240 --> 00:21.960
information and Beat Saber works to keep you healthy. There's also speculation, sad news,

00:21.960 --> 00:25.180
squabbles, and plenty more to discuss. So let's kick off episode two to the power of three

00:25.180 --> 00:28.180
and four right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.180 --> 00:32.180
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.180 --> 00:36.180
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

00:36.180 --> 00:42.020
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 816

00:42.020 --> 00:49.620
of our show for this April the 19th of 2020. My name is Rob Roberts, joining you live and

00:49.620 --> 00:54.340
here in our studio that usually we all gather live in, but due to the circumstances going

00:54.340 --> 00:58.460
on in the real world right now, of course, we are recording over distance. So thanks

00:58.460 --> 01:02.740
to the magic of Discord, I am joined by the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:02.740 --> 01:03.740
Oh, hi.

01:03.740 --> 01:04.740
Hi, how are you?

01:04.740 --> 01:13.020
I'm doing all right. It's been a long day and a long week and the better times are ahead.

01:13.020 --> 01:22.180
Well, let me be the first to say tonight. Happy birthday, DarkSakura. It is your birthday.

01:22.180 --> 01:26.620
Yes, it is. And I am this many years old.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.620
And she's holding up 21 fingers.

01:28.620 --> 01:37.940
Oh, well, don't tell people where I got those hands from. Okay. But anyway, yeah, it's my

01:37.940 --> 01:46.540
my birthday. I was squirted out a while ago. Wow. pain and general disappointment of the

01:46.540 --> 01:47.540
world.

01:47.900 --> 01:53.220
Well, congratulations on hitting a milestone. I know I know that birthdays during the pandemic

01:53.220 --> 01:56.860
are a little because, you know, I've known quite a few people at this point who've who've

01:56.860 --> 02:01.140
had birthdays, but hopefully you're able to kind of make the best of the situation and

02:01.140 --> 02:03.780
you get a makeup birthday when this is all over.

02:03.780 --> 02:10.760
I reckon so. And Phoenix7726 said happy 21st. Now you can have a drink. I've been day drinking

02:10.760 --> 02:14.220
all day. I started 11.

02:14.220 --> 02:16.300
What's your drink of choice today?

02:17.060 --> 02:26.340
Well, a good friend who I think she's been on the show a long time ago, sent me a bottle

02:26.340 --> 02:33.220
of Godiva chocolate liqueur, which I have just had the biggest craving for for like,

02:33.220 --> 02:39.020
at least since I had better lung capacity. So maybe after I was first done with the actual

02:39.020 --> 02:46.420
sick part of pneumonia. So, yeah, and I have my bottle and it makes me happy and I've been

02:46.420 --> 02:52.500
pouring it in coffee and also some Kraken, which I'm not drinking anything right now.

02:52.500 --> 03:00.700
I have one left of my Trader Joe's chocolate Botswin stout. So I'm going to have that tonight.

03:00.700 --> 03:05.620
I should have brought the can to Frivolo and left it on your doorstep, but I took a nap.

03:06.500 --> 03:10.180
I took a nap. I took a very important nap. Well, you know what? It'll just be one of

03:10.180 --> 03:11.140
those things I'll have to do midweek.

03:11.140 --> 03:15.860
You can work from home and tomorrow and just drop it off after the show. I got you.

03:15.860 --> 03:22.580
I do. I do work from home right now. Yeah. And I'm very fortunate. I'm a big. Yeah. I know there's

03:22.580 --> 03:27.340
a lot of just like instability with things going on out there. So I trust me. I'm very,

03:27.340 --> 03:29.820
very thankful for the situation I'm given right now.

03:30.140 --> 03:35.860
SSJ 100 Matt asked how the stout is and given that it's on one of my lists of favorites and

03:35.860 --> 03:41.500
I will sometimes drink it over a Guinness. Yeah. It's pretty good. Ooh. Mel Chan 13 in

03:41.500 --> 03:46.300
chat says I have a whiskey ginger lemonade. It is tasty. That sounds really good. It's very close.

03:46.300 --> 03:50.980
You say ginger. My absolute favorite drink is a Moscow mule bonus points. If you can actually

03:50.980 --> 03:55.380
serve it in the copper cup. So, uh, yeah, that kind of made me think of that. Cause it's,

03:55.380 --> 03:59.460
I'm one of those girls that I get very expensive whiskey and I drink it neat.

04:00.060 --> 04:04.500
All right. Well, we know what to get you for your birthday. So, so lately I've actually had to drink

04:04.500 --> 04:11.060
whiskey and bourbon on the rocks just because it hits me so much faster. Um, now, uh, they're

04:11.060 --> 04:15.340
saying in chat that you actually like your audio qualities actually sounds better tonight, but I

04:15.340 --> 04:20.060
think that I don't think you've changed mics. I think that may be a side effect of your like

04:20.060 --> 04:25.580
healthier than you've been in weeks. Right. Oh yeah, no. Um, I, my whole medication, uh,

04:25.620 --> 04:32.140
like regimen has been, uh, bumped up quite a bit. I still, I still get a little short of breath,

04:32.140 --> 04:39.020
but I feel like I've got better, better vocal capacity. Um, and uh, yeah, and I have been

04:39.020 --> 04:44.220
drinking, so maybe that helped. That's right. And by the way, we are reading shout outs in

04:44.220 --> 04:47.900
our chat room because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network,

04:47.900 --> 04:53.660
twitch.tv slash vog network, V O G voice of geeks network. And we are on at six o'clock Pacific

04:53.660 --> 04:59.740
nine o'clock Eastern ish right after the Bobby black Wolf show. And, uh, also speaking of voice

04:59.740 --> 05:07.100
quality and I think improved voice quality, let's say hello to tech master Loki. Hello. Hi, how are

05:07.100 --> 05:12.700
you? I'm fine. You sound much better. You do not sound like you're on a tin can anymore. This is

05:12.700 --> 05:19.820
great. Well, that's because before I was on a webcam mic and now I'm on a rock band mic. I love

05:19.820 --> 05:25.260
it. You are legit on a rocket for a PlayStation two, like USB mic. It was an X-Box three 60,

05:25.260 --> 05:29.260
but yeah, it's the, the old logitech mic. So they used to actually, I don't even think this is from

05:29.260 --> 05:34.060
rock band. I think this may be from karaoke revolution. Um, just had it leftover from all

05:34.060 --> 05:40.220
that stuff, but Oh my, they're all compatible. Oh my God. I have one of those that, that sealed

05:40.220 --> 05:45.660
karaoke revolution country. That's been sitting in the studio. Who knew there's a freaking mic

05:45.660 --> 05:50.220
in there. Maybe that's how I fixed some that are watching on Twitch will notice I'm using a

05:50.220 --> 05:54.620
different mic too, because I think, you know, we upgraded the mics in the studio a few months ago,

05:54.620 --> 05:58.860
but I honestly think they've been causing more problems, which is unfortunate. So I'm actually

05:58.860 --> 06:02.780
trying to switch mics tonight to try to get some of the popping, um, to calm down a little bit.

06:02.780 --> 06:07.420
Maybe I need to switch to the fricking karaoke. I'm looking around, but they're all USB mics,

06:07.420 --> 06:11.580
but they're not bad. And this one must be brand new because it's wrapped up nicely. The cord is

06:11.580 --> 06:15.340
wrapped up neatly because whenever I rewrap that it's never going to be like that again.

06:15.340 --> 06:21.100
So, um, yeah. Rob girl, you are not Alyssa Edwards. Stop the popping.

06:22.700 --> 06:29.500
Oh, okay. Uh, let's see going to our chat. Uh, yeah, a lot of compliments on Loki sound tonight

06:29.500 --> 06:34.060
and people are, are really hilariously digging the fact that you're using a rock band mic

06:34.060 --> 06:39.420
and people's confessing. This is just, this is like a, it's a good entry-level podcast, Mike.

06:39.420 --> 06:43.260
Maybe that's the advice we want to give to people that want to use this opportunity to start a

06:43.260 --> 06:48.860
podcast, which unlike Twitter and people trying to be funny on Twitter who are not funny, ever

06:48.860 --> 06:54.300
funny, uh, saying, Oh, please, whatever you do, don't start a podcast. Uh, to that, I say,

06:54.300 --> 07:00.620
fuck that. I say, absolutely yes. Start a podcast, especially if you think you're the type of person

07:00.620 --> 07:04.940
who shouldn't be podcasting and you probably are the type of person that should be podcasting.

07:05.340 --> 07:11.260
And I think this is great advice. Dust off your rock band or karaoke, uh, karaoke revolution

07:11.260 --> 07:16.140
microphones. And you've got a good starter kit right there. Uh, VGRealness when VGRealness did

07:16.140 --> 07:20.940
a podcast, we did it with four separate rock and Mike and Mike's attached to a USB hub.

07:20.940 --> 07:27.260
Uh, Bobby says my first podcast microphone was a karaoke microphone. Um, tiger class

07:27.260 --> 07:31.180
says someday you'll get one of those mic holder things that you mount on a desk so that you don't

07:31.180 --> 07:36.140
always have to hold it. Uh, yes, I want to get one of those like elaborate, like hook type things,

07:36.140 --> 07:40.700
because the problem is I do have, we do have like a tiny baby stand. I had one sitting around here

07:40.700 --> 07:45.180
cause, um, dark soccer was using it for like two weeks before this whole thing started. Um,

07:45.180 --> 07:50.380
but it's too, it's, it confines like I would have to sit here and talk like this for the entire show

07:50.380 --> 07:54.380
and it would be very awkward. So I need something that lets me move a little more naturally because

07:54.380 --> 08:00.540
I think I paid five bucks for it. Yeah. I think granted when we are all in the same room, which

08:00.540 --> 08:04.700
is how this podcast is intended to be, obviously we're not right now because of the state of the

08:04.700 --> 08:08.460
world and setting a good example, but when we're in the same room, we'd like to kind of look at

08:08.460 --> 08:13.820
each other and interact and play off each other and stuff. Um, and so I think movement is very

08:13.820 --> 08:19.340
important and not, and that's why I've always been a big proponent of hand mics. Although most

08:19.340 --> 08:24.700
podcasters would think I am nuts, but I'm like, there's positives and there's negatives. The

08:24.700 --> 08:29.580
positive is I get an additional energy off being able to feed off my co-hosts that I think a lot

08:29.580 --> 08:33.580
of people don't always get. So, and that's the type of stuff you have to weigh for what works

08:33.580 --> 08:40.780
for you. So anyway, uh, tiger class says, have you thought of headset mics? Um, yes. Uh, in fact,

08:40.780 --> 08:46.860
I think, aren't you using one right now? I am. I'm using my work mic. Um, not, I mean, it's,

08:46.860 --> 08:51.740
it's one of those Jabra mics. They're not cheap. I mean, but I think it sounds okay. Sounds pretty

08:51.740 --> 08:56.140
good. Honestly, in the perfect world, I'd have those little lavalier mics, just like they have

08:56.140 --> 09:01.260
on, um, the nightly news or, you know, when you, uh, professional grade stuff that that's ideal

09:01.260 --> 09:06.620
for me, honestly. So, um, who knows, maybe with enough biddies and subs, we'll get there. I'm just,

09:06.620 --> 09:10.780
I'm teasing what, I'm not really going to beg for money. Although certainly we always welcome

09:10.780 --> 09:15.020
that type of stuff. And it does go back to running the show and all that good stuff. But, um,

09:15.020 --> 09:19.980
who knows? We'll see. Uh, the nice thing is, again, not that any of this going on in the

09:19.980 --> 09:24.940
real world right now is nice, but if there is a silver lining, I don't know about you guys,

09:24.940 --> 09:31.660
but I'm saving money because I'm not driving. Uh, I'm not going out to eat as much. I'm not like,

09:31.660 --> 09:36.140
there's certain places where I'm like actually saving money. And again, I completely realize

09:36.140 --> 09:40.860
there are other people right now that are in a very much financial hardship. So I don't want

09:40.860 --> 09:46.540
to sound like I'm, I'm, uh, unaware of, of some of that privilege that I have with, with my work

09:46.540 --> 09:51.580
situation, everything, but I am able to kind of like save money so I can hopefully maybe invest

09:51.580 --> 09:57.340
in some of those things. So for what it's worth. So anyway, our gas bill though has been much

09:57.340 --> 10:03.180
higher because Dan has been, well, he cooked the entire time that I've had pneumonia and since,

10:03.180 --> 10:08.540
since I was still recovering. So yeah, that's, and yeah, Alan's been doing a lot of cooking around

10:08.540 --> 10:12.540
here too. Like he made muffins the other day. That's never happened. So that's fun. So,

10:13.100 --> 10:17.260
all right. Uh, anyhow, let's actually, we, we are a video game show, so let's get into talking about

10:17.260 --> 10:21.260
some video games. Although this kickoff topic tonight is a little bit like video games are

10:21.500 --> 10:25.900
like a part of it, but it does have to do with, um, somewhat kind of like our world situation

10:25.900 --> 10:30.700
right now, where most of us are staying at home. In fact, everybody really should be staying at

10:30.700 --> 10:35.500
home unless you are in a country that is somehow unaffected by this. But I think every country is

10:35.500 --> 10:39.340
at this point. Um, so most people are staying at home so that they're not, you know, spreading the,

10:39.340 --> 10:42.620
well, and you're not staying at home if you're an essential worker, that's, that's what I'm looking

10:42.620 --> 10:51.500
for. Um, and so, um, many people are, um, trying to, you know, with the gym's clothes and, um,

10:51.500 --> 10:56.860
other ways that maybe have been ways that you were getting fit before, maybe like walking to

10:56.860 --> 11:01.100
a subway or walking to transit or a bus or something and back, maybe you're not doing

11:01.100 --> 11:06.460
that as much anymore. Um, so you're looking for other ways to get, uh, fitness. And so video games

11:07.420 --> 11:13.420
is a big kind of method for that for a lot of people. Uh, and, uh, kind of knowing that that

11:13.420 --> 11:19.580
is the case, one big video game this week released a kind of fitness related song.

11:19.580 --> 11:24.700
Uh, Beat Saber is the game. And of course, a lot of you guys know, Beat Saber is a hugely popular

11:24.700 --> 11:29.580
VR game. It's almost in some ways, the, the flagship, the Wii Sports of VR, almost, I don't

11:29.580 --> 11:33.420
know Half-Life, Alyx might be there soon, but I think a lot of people recognize Beat Saber as like

11:33.420 --> 11:39.020
one of the VR games. And of course, Beat Saber is a music-based game and it's kind of a workout.

11:39.020 --> 11:42.300
You know, when you're waving those hands around frantically and, you know, you're kind of trying

11:42.300 --> 11:47.180
to dodge pillars in that game, so you're moving your whole body up, down, side, side, it can be

11:47.180 --> 11:53.580
quite a bit of a workout. Well, uh, there was a new song released this week called Fitbit,

11:53.580 --> 11:59.260
excuse me, Fitbeat, excuse me. It is a free official song and is going to help you get a

11:59.260 --> 12:02.940
workout. And in fact, looking at the preview video, they're playing it an expert or whatever

12:03.020 --> 12:06.860
the most hardcore mode is. And it looks like a heck of a workout. Luckily, I'm sure there's

12:06.860 --> 12:11.660
easier modes that I could actually play. But the interesting thing about Fitbeat is that the song

12:11.660 --> 12:18.220
is actually designed to, to give your body a workout. So it's designed with the step pattern.

12:18.220 --> 12:22.700
I say step pattern because my mind goes to DDR, but you know, with the note pattern and that

12:22.700 --> 12:26.460
in mind to really work your body out. And I thought that was kind of a neat

12:26.460 --> 12:31.900
concept is that, you know, especially when you consider this particular show's roots in music

12:31.900 --> 12:36.620
gaming and the fact that, you know, a lot of us back in the day in 2002, when we started,

12:36.620 --> 12:41.260
we're using things like Dance Dance Revolution and Power Power Paradise, and, you know, those

12:41.260 --> 12:46.540
types of games for fitness as well as fun. It's, it's kind of interesting that in this world

12:46.540 --> 12:51.820
situation, we have Beat Saber is one option of many. We'll talk about some of those other

12:51.820 --> 12:56.700
options in a minute. Beat Saber is kind of one option for people to stay fit. And now it's like,

12:56.700 --> 13:01.340
not only is it just that you're playing the game to be fit, but this is designed with fitness in

13:01.340 --> 13:05.980
mind. It's kind of like, uh, you guys remember Dance Dance Revolution on the PlayStation 2

13:05.980 --> 13:09.980
had like a fitness mode, right? Did you guys ever use fitness mode to actually be fit?

13:11.260 --> 13:14.140
Well, not to be fit just as a personal challenge. How so?

13:15.660 --> 13:18.940
Just to keep up with it. Can I do this? Can I do this round?

13:19.740 --> 13:24.060
Okay. Um, did you guys actually, let me, let me sidetrack a little bit. How,

13:24.060 --> 13:29.020
you know, especially because if in a weird way, the DDR stuff is kind of older at this point,

13:29.020 --> 13:32.620
right? Dance Dance Revolution and all that was, you know, 10 plus years ago when we were playing

13:32.620 --> 13:37.740
that stuff on the PlayStation 2, what was the fitness mode and what was the fitness kind of

13:37.740 --> 13:46.140
like in those games? It's similar to the arcade. Basically it calculates the number of steps that

13:46.140 --> 13:52.060
you're taking based on the steps that are in the song and assigns it a calorie value based on that.

13:52.060 --> 13:57.580
That's how the, um, like I think a, and I don't even know when they started, but with all the,

13:57.660 --> 14:04.540
um, profiles and everything on there, they do calculate, uh, calorie burning in there as well,

14:04.540 --> 14:08.060
based on the number of steps and difficulty of the song, right. And maybe beat him or something

14:08.060 --> 14:13.660
like that. And it's super inaccurate. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's, it's a little bit rudimentary,

14:13.660 --> 14:18.620
um, because it's, it's, I don't think it's taking into account height or weight or any of that when

14:18.620 --> 14:23.420
it does the calorie calculation, does it? I think you can set it up online when you're

14:23.500 --> 14:28.140
setting up your, your account, um, to actually put your height and weight in there, but yeah,

14:28.140 --> 14:32.300
it's still pretty even, yeah. Even then, you know, everybody is different. So it's,

14:32.300 --> 14:37.580
it's going to be an estimation at best. Um, lots of folks in chat lighting up on this topic,

14:37.580 --> 14:41.500
uh, cause I know we have a lot of old school music game fans and chat, uh, pixel pocket says I've

14:41.500 --> 14:46.860
been playing a ridiculous amount of DDR with my step mania stage. Uh, Mel Chan said, uh, I wanted

14:46.860 --> 14:50.460
to get ring fit adventure, but it's gone through the roof price wise. We'll talk, come back and

14:50.460 --> 14:56.060
talk about ring fit adventure in a bit. Uh, mr Rizzo's in chat, uh, says I'm still playing

14:56.060 --> 15:02.540
just dance. So kind of like a cousin to DDR kind of like a modern, you know, day, uh, dance game.

15:02.540 --> 15:06.940
Uh, obviously those games are still huge. I'm still playing just dance in sweat mode to try

15:06.940 --> 15:13.340
to keep moving. You know, and I've seen tweets of even in this type of situation, I've saw tweets

15:13.340 --> 15:18.220
of friends who are setting up their old school PlayStation two, or I think in this one case,

15:18.220 --> 15:24.860
I saw an Xbox three 60 Matt with the universe games, um, setting that up on the wooden panels

15:24.860 --> 15:30.460
to prevent the mats from bunching up and like, like this is my workout regime right now because

15:30.460 --> 15:34.700
24 hour fitness is closed or whatever it is. Or, you know, I know a lot of people are still going

15:34.700 --> 15:39.180
outside, which is, it's a good thing. Doctors recommend you should still be going outside for

15:39.180 --> 15:42.300
30 minutes a day, just as long as you're maintaining social distance rules and everything

15:42.300 --> 15:48.060
like that. But not everybody necessarily wants to run outside or, you know, exercise and sweat

15:48.060 --> 15:52.700
and all that outside. Maybe, maybe going outside is literally just catching some sun and you want

15:52.700 --> 15:55.980
to do the working out in the comfort of your own home. That's, you know, so a lot of people set up

15:55.980 --> 16:04.060
those types of home gym types of setups and video games are a great way to do that. So, um, anyhow,

16:04.060 --> 16:09.660
uh, continuing with the fit beat story, uh, if you want to grab this song, it is free. It's available

16:09.660 --> 16:16.380
for PlayStation VR, as well as Oculus steam. Uh, it works with the one saber mode and 360 degree

16:16.380 --> 16:20.300
modes in addition to the regular two saber. So they, they flushed out with all the different

16:20.300 --> 16:24.860
modes that beat saber supports. Um, and I know when I've played beat saber on PlayStation VR,

16:24.860 --> 16:29.260
where I own it, I get quite a bit of exercise from that game. So that is a good way, I think,

16:29.260 --> 16:34.380
to get some exercise. I also really liked Otica, which is another music game. You don't flail quite

16:34.380 --> 16:38.460
as much, but I think it's still a bit of workout and that's a really good one as well. Although,

16:38.460 --> 16:45.020
um, not everything has to be VR for exercise. Not everybody necessarily enjoys VR. Uh, some people

16:45.020 --> 16:50.300
may find working out with that headset a little awkward. Um, so there's certainly other ways to

16:50.300 --> 16:55.580
do it, such as we had just dance was mentioned, uh, old school DDR and those types of games

16:55.580 --> 17:00.780
and ring fit adventure, uh, and SSJ 100 Matt and our chat at twitch.tv slash VOG network says,

17:00.780 --> 17:06.140
I've been playing ring fit adventure since this whole thing started. I lost five pounds playing

17:06.140 --> 17:13.260
it in the past 30 days and feeling stronger in my arms and legs. Still hate doing squats though,

17:13.340 --> 17:17.660
but squats are awesome and Final Fantasy seven remake, just saying, anyway, um,

17:18.380 --> 17:24.300
Bobby Blackwell says, Otica is arm day. Uh, Beat Saber does some leg day. Uh, Bobby says,

17:24.300 --> 17:29.820
pull out your old Wii fit. Uh, and she hold 10 kind of, uh, piggybacks on that saying

17:29.820 --> 17:36.060
we tennis. Absolutely. Uh, so there's all sorts of ways that people are using video games to stay

17:36.060 --> 17:40.780
fit. I'm kind of curious for my co-hosts and that we've heard from some of the chatters,

17:40.780 --> 17:46.300
but if you guys want to expand on that more, are you guys using video games at all to stay

17:46.300 --> 17:51.260
fit and get X exercise during this? If so, like what is kind of your routine?

17:53.500 --> 17:59.180
Um, well, I've been playing step mania on my arcade cabinet, so doing that a little bit.

17:59.820 --> 18:03.100
Oh yeah. You're not as much, you're fortunate to have the whole stinking cabinet in your garage.

18:03.100 --> 18:09.100
That's pretty good. Yeah. Not as much as I would like to be, but, um, easy myself back in there.

18:09.100 --> 18:14.700
Nice. Uh, dark Sakura, I don't know if you have cause you've been kind of sick, but anything.

18:14.700 --> 18:21.820
I've been a lot sick. Yeah. So I've done two things, Jack and shit. So, um, no plans

18:21.820 --> 18:26.620
maybe now that you're feeling better. Well, I'm going to try to see if I have the lung

18:26.620 --> 18:35.260
capacity to take an actual walk around my block tomorrow. But, um, you know, um, Dan and I talked

18:35.340 --> 18:42.380
about busting out the dream cast for second, uh, for second mix, just kind of off hand. Um,

18:43.260 --> 18:47.180
um, I'm kind of thinking I might do the DDR thing again, but just so far, I've just been doing,

18:47.180 --> 18:52.700
um, standard exercise, uh, yoga while listening to, uh, my, uh, my favorite podcasts really.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.660
Including orange sounds radio. I'm just kidding.

18:58.700 --> 19:03.820
But I do subscribe to us. Okay. That's good. That's good. Um, go ahead.

19:04.460 --> 19:09.020
Oh, but you know, if, if anyone wants to know what my favorite podcasts are to ask me later,

19:09.020 --> 19:15.260
I will tell you, cause they're awesome people. Um, I will say the one answer that nobody said

19:15.260 --> 19:22.460
yet, uh, is my good old GPS games. I use a lot when walking, um, Orna has been a big one lately,

19:22.460 --> 19:25.980
just because that's kind of been the game of the moment. But also the nice thing about Orna

19:25.980 --> 19:32.780
is that it's not tied to, um, pokey stops or, you know, certain areas specifically, uh, Jamie,

19:32.780 --> 19:37.580
we can hear your keyboard, just, you know, um, that's all right. Uh, so it's not tied to like

19:37.580 --> 19:41.980
specific places like pokey stops and gyms of monsters and those types of things and Orna

19:41.980 --> 19:47.100
spawn everywhere. Um, so if I just kind of like walk around the block where there might not be

19:47.100 --> 19:51.020
any pokey stops, I can still do something. So that's been a really good game for that.

19:51.020 --> 19:54.940
Um, but I know a lot of people still play Pokemon go and I've played that too, because I might go

19:54.940 --> 20:01.180
to the park and play that, um, Ingress, um, that the, the play in that has slowed down tremendously

20:01.180 --> 20:04.620
because most people are kind of staying in their own neighborhoods. So it's kind of one of those,

20:04.620 --> 20:10.300
I like to go walking at one of the local parks, but like, if my competition hasn't taken it over

20:10.300 --> 20:15.180
for their team, they don't go there as much as I do. So I oftentimes go there and I have nothing

20:15.180 --> 20:20.380
to do because it's still, uh, my team's color. So, but they took it today. So I need to go,

20:20.380 --> 20:24.380
uh, take care of that tomorrow, but we'll see. But yeah, I mean, that's been a good way to just

20:24.380 --> 20:29.340
get out, get some sun and so forth is the nice, uh, GPS gaming. So there's that as well. Um,

20:30.220 --> 20:35.900
and I know Pokemon go, especially has really been trying to, uh, rely on the incense. Um,

20:35.900 --> 20:39.980
so you can really make more Pokemon spawn, even if you're just sitting in place. I know they did

20:39.980 --> 20:45.500
a big event today. I checked it out for a little bit, but I wasn't going to sit there for six hours

20:45.500 --> 20:50.380
playing that rating at home stuff yet. I don't think they've actually turned it on yet.

20:50.380 --> 20:54.620
I know they've announced it, but it's not turned on yet, but I would imagine that's coming in the

20:54.620 --> 20:59.500
next week. Uh, or very, very soon. I think before community day, cause community day is being

20:59.500 --> 21:07.340
advertised with that new raid pass. Uh, and I got a new gym right nearby. So obviously I have to

21:07.340 --> 21:13.180
keep it vague cause I don't like giving my address away on air, but I got a second gym added within

21:13.180 --> 21:18.540
my site, what I can see from the house. So that will be like, um, something I can use, uh, cause

21:18.540 --> 21:23.820
it says you can rate anything in your nearby view. So that's kind of nice. Oh, that's cool. Yeah.

21:23.820 --> 21:28.140
So, um, I wonder if I can hit the, hit the one for my part. Um, you might as well, if, if it

21:28.140 --> 21:33.420
comes up in your nearby, if like an egg is on it, then it's something you'll be able to remote raid.

21:33.420 --> 21:38.300
That is apparently what the rules are supposed to be. Um, as to 200, Matt and chat says, I have

21:38.300 --> 21:42.220
still been playing Pokemon go during this whole thing. I just play late at night when not a lot

21:42.220 --> 21:46.780
of people are around. And that's 200. Matt says, I forgot about the event. I think that might also

21:46.780 --> 21:51.660
tie into Pokemon goes kind of event fatigue. They've they're almost doing so many events.

21:51.660 --> 21:56.140
It's hard to keep track of them sometimes. And some of them just fall off the radar. Like I've,

21:56.140 --> 22:00.700
I've kind of given up on tracking all the Pokemon go events. Like I just play when I want to play.

22:01.340 --> 22:06.700
They're clearly not increasing the level cap anytime soon. I'll catch them all eventually.

22:06.700 --> 22:11.580
So I've kind of, I've kind of turned into filthy casual when it comes to Pokemon go. And that is

22:11.580 --> 22:16.940
a okay. So, all right. Well, anyhow, I don't think I've touched it in a while to be honest.

22:16.940 --> 22:21.180
Well, Hey, you know, if you start going for more walks that might that or order or so whatever's

22:21.180 --> 22:25.180
up your alley might be the type of thing. That's just a kind of something that motivates you to

22:25.180 --> 22:29.420
take a few more steps. You know what I mean? Yeah. I just saw that we unlocked falling King

22:29.420 --> 22:34.140
Arthas, but apparently I can't bite him yet. Yeah. I doubt anybody. Yeah.

22:35.100 --> 22:41.180
Well, that's doing that. Yeah. I'll be honest now though, when I'm walking or something like that,

22:41.180 --> 22:47.180
I don't want to be distracted by looking at my phone when I'm trying to enjoy the scenery around

22:47.180 --> 22:52.460
me. I'm just saying that's fair. Um, you know, I, I think you can find a blend of both. I try to

22:52.460 --> 22:56.460
try to have a little bit of both, especially if I'm playing around sunset. Um, I find that the

22:56.460 --> 23:00.220
phone can motivate me to kind of keep out there and then, Oh yeah. It's kind of look up once in

23:00.220 --> 23:04.940
a while, you know, especially, um, if I'm well, you know, before the pandemic started, uh, when

23:04.940 --> 23:09.340
I was playing Ingress in new areas, then it was very encouraging to kind of like, Oh, I never

23:09.340 --> 23:12.860
would have thought this was here before. And you kind of stopped to check out, uh, that world

23:12.860 --> 23:17.100
around you. So it's, um, kind of cool. So, all right. Kind of, I thought it would be interesting

23:17.100 --> 23:21.580
to kind of hear about some of these fitness type of ways that were, you know, still staying fit in

23:21.580 --> 23:27.020
this particular circumstance. Um, especially, uh, with this Beat Saber track, uh, having come out

23:27.020 --> 23:31.580
this week specifically about fitness, let's move on though, and talk about, uh, the types of games

23:31.580 --> 23:35.580
that we have been playing this week, whether they're fit or otherwise, and how was your gaming

23:35.580 --> 23:40.060
week? So dark Sakura, how was your gaming week? What do you been playing? Animal crossing.

23:40.060 --> 23:47.580
Of course. How's that going to be my gaming week for the next two years. Okay. Yeah. Um, really,

23:47.580 --> 23:52.780
um, we finally, you know, got the KK things to the end of the storyline. I never say it's the

23:52.780 --> 23:56.700
end of the game because the game is always ongoing. Dan still has the 2 million bell

23:56.700 --> 24:04.540
loan to pay off for his basement. Now you're in the end game. Um, the animal crossing end game,

24:04.540 --> 24:11.420
five star rating and the stonk market stonks. I actually did buy my first, uh,

24:11.420 --> 24:17.980
Torps for actual doing a stock market. Well, you've got that whole little Facebook group

24:17.980 --> 24:23.180
to share prices. And I've been added to two different Facebook groups for animal crossing.

24:23.180 --> 24:29.020
Uh, there's yours. Yeah. And there's another one I got added to as well. And, uh, it's just,

24:29.020 --> 24:32.940
it's great for checking up on turnip prices and stuff. So I wonder how long that's going to go.

24:33.420 --> 24:37.420
Well, mine hasn't really died down at all in livelihood either.

24:37.420 --> 24:41.180
And we know one of the other fun things about it is that, um,

24:42.620 --> 24:48.300
it actually has been growing by more people. Like when I started this, I started it with 10 people

24:49.100 --> 24:53.900
and I was like, Hey, you can add a friend here and there and a friend here and there turned into,

24:55.420 --> 24:58.620
I don't know how many people we have in there. I'd have to go look at the statistics again,

24:59.180 --> 25:05.740
but that group is just really growing. And if you're on, um, on Facebook, I do keep my Facebook

25:05.740 --> 25:12.300
very, very hidden. Um, so if you're not, you know, a mutual or something, um, if you're a mutual

25:12.300 --> 25:19.580
reach out, let me know. Um, if you find me on, uh, Twitter, I might be able to get you

25:19.580 --> 25:24.620
away into the group. So we'll see, but the group is doing pretty well. Um, and everyone's been

25:24.620 --> 25:29.100
really forthcoming. No one's like, Hey, I'm selling this for 50 million bells. You have

25:29.100 --> 25:34.140
to pay it up or nothing. You need to leave a 50,000 bell tip and there will be a bodyguard

25:34.140 --> 25:39.660
there amongst the fence path to collect. I can't stand that side of the game. I'm sorry. Those are

25:39.660 --> 25:43.420
the types of groups I don't want to be in. You know, the only thing that I do, if it's an

25:43.420 --> 25:50.140
absolute stranger, I'll do a limited code. And I got the idea from somebody of, um,

25:50.140 --> 25:58.220
uh, putting, uh, a booth, like one of those little stands in front of, um, where the, uh,

25:58.220 --> 26:04.620
airport is so that they can't get past it. Although I did wall off most of my, uh, village

26:04.620 --> 26:10.860
because, um, and I'm not, you know, I'm not mad about it, but I've been more cautious that, um,

26:10.860 --> 26:15.420
one of my friends, um, husband was playing on her account while she was, you know, tending to their,

26:15.420 --> 26:23.340
their two-year-old. And, um, he came and shot down a bunch of my bamboo. Oh, yikes. Okay.

26:23.980 --> 26:30.620
Cause I had, I had, um, cause the character in as a best friend. Yeah. Yeah. Or just,

26:30.620 --> 26:34.540
you just the normal friend opening. But if you're someone's in with a dodo code, then they can dig

26:34.540 --> 26:38.940
up your flowers and all of that. And I normally, you know, I'm fine with it. Usually I'm like,

26:38.940 --> 26:43.500
Hey, look, I have extra of these blue pansies and I've got purple pansies now for the record.

26:43.500 --> 26:49.180
Um, yeah, yeah. Go ahead and dig yourself up too. You know, and they chopped down. I mean,

26:49.180 --> 26:54.460
thankfully I had sprouts. I could, you know, I could regrow the bamboo. It was fine. But I was

26:54.460 --> 26:58.540
like, Hey, just talk to your husband and tell him that ain't cool. And she's like, Oh, he didn't

26:58.540 --> 27:03.820
know any better. He's sorry. He says he's sorry. I'm like, okay. But still, I, I actually now I

27:03.820 --> 27:09.980
have a, we call it our gated community. Um, and I'm finally getting my 10th villager, but I have

27:09.980 --> 27:15.260
the way I have it laid out is the fences go, and they're really unobtrusive until you actually try

27:15.260 --> 27:20.940
to leave, to go across the bridge. My river is, you know, four spaces wide now, you know,

27:20.940 --> 27:27.580
at that cutoff point. So I've got pads that end. So, um, I've really, uh, you know, it's kind of

27:27.580 --> 27:34.780
like how you can like at Disneyland, how they redo the chains to reform the Cuba reroute that I live

27:34.780 --> 27:40.860
in Disneyland now. See, I just, I just wouldn't invite anyone. I didn't trust to not screw up my

27:40.860 --> 27:44.460
town. Like, and you know, unless you put them on your best friends list, they can't, and you know,

27:44.460 --> 27:48.620
you're not, you're just not going to be able to a hundred percent prevent the, like the, the husband

27:48.620 --> 27:51.900
signing on the wife's account or whatever that whole thing, like, you're not going to be able to

27:51.900 --> 27:54.780
a hundred percent stamp that out. Those types of issues are going to happen, but I just wouldn't

27:54.780 --> 27:59.100
invite anyone in my town that I didn't trust to like, go to nooks, do your thing, please don't

27:59.100 --> 28:02.460
run through the flowers, but if they run through flowers and they don't run through flowers,

28:03.260 --> 28:06.700
but if they run through flowers and they grow back in two days, they're just going to irritate me.

28:06.700 --> 28:10.460
Yeah. It doesn't destroy the flowers. Yeah. It's not like it wasn't the older games. Like,

28:10.460 --> 28:14.460
as long as you don't add them to your best friends list, they're really limited on what they can do.

28:15.180 --> 28:20.780
Well, the thing that I'm really doing is I'm trying to still encourage that open trade in the,

28:20.780 --> 28:26.620
uh, in the community. So like today I walled off my sections and I stuck down my happy birthday

28:26.620 --> 28:30.700
sign, which there'll be pictures up on my Instagram. That's, uh, double to no Shema,

28:30.700 --> 28:38.620
uh, you know, double to underscore no underscore Shema. Um, and, uh, I, uh, you know, I had like

28:38.620 --> 28:42.620
a little birthday party and everything that Agnes threw for me who I'm actually liking Agnes,

28:42.620 --> 28:48.060
even though I call her a, you know, a bitch whenever I'm looking for. Um, but I had it to

28:48.060 --> 28:54.300
where people could go visit my villagers. They can go to my stores, they could go in my museum,

28:54.300 --> 28:58.700
you know, I can do little pictures and everything. I had my happy birthday sign it and a cake and

28:58.700 --> 29:03.420
everything out. And I sat in the director's chair and, you know, and, you know, had a held

29:03.420 --> 29:11.260
court PRI outfit. Cause it'll have enough bells for the crown. Um, and so, um, and you and Dan

29:11.260 --> 29:16.780
and I last night, you know, we'll more like up to two in the morning. We, since I got terraforming,

29:16.780 --> 29:21.420
we, you know, redid the grounds and we move things around and we just had a great time, you know,

29:21.420 --> 29:26.380
it's been something, and I'm surprised that Dan has gotten as into it as he has. Um, but it's

29:26.460 --> 29:31.100
something that he and I can do together. Um, and for the record, we do have a final fantasy

29:31.100 --> 29:37.900
seven remake, but we haven't been so inclined to play it. Not yet. Interesting. Just cause you're

29:37.900 --> 29:43.340
just so into animal crossing. Oh, that too. And it's just like, when we're not doing animal

29:43.340 --> 29:47.740
crossing, we're watching our normal, you know, YouTube channels that we like to watch. Like we

29:47.740 --> 29:54.060
like the, uh, the four levels of chef videos and we like the gourmet recreates videos and we like

29:54.140 --> 29:57.420
binging with Babish. So you're just, you're just not in a rush to get to it. You'll get to it when

29:57.420 --> 30:02.220
you get to it. Yeah. Retro core. That's another one. And we've also played a little bit of pinball

30:02.220 --> 30:06.220
together. It's going to be two years before the next episode comes out anyway. So, I mean,

30:06.220 --> 30:12.700
it's not a big deal. I don't think. No. Yeah. So yeah, we've got time. I'm cool with it. Cool.

30:12.700 --> 30:17.020
All right. Well, um, by the way, I don't think you heard the end of Bobby's show because he was

30:17.020 --> 30:21.580
telling a story, uh, that would have piqued your interest. Now I would encourage everybody to

30:21.580 --> 30:25.420
listen to the Bobby Black Wolf show. Uh, but I will, I will summarize his story.

30:25.420 --> 30:30.540
So Bobby has been trying to get one specific villager to come to his island and it's the

30:30.540 --> 30:34.540
villager everybody wants. It's Oddie, right? The, the one named after the grandmother,

30:34.540 --> 30:40.460
um, that played. So he's been using, um, Nook Miles tickets to go talk to, uh, all those,

30:40.460 --> 30:44.700
you know, villagers that hang out on the island, right? Because when you have an open house,

30:44.700 --> 30:49.900
uh, there will be villagers on the Nook Miles Island. Uh, like I just got boomer, uh, yesterday.

30:49.900 --> 30:53.900
So I finally have a penguin in my town for the first time ever in all of my Animal Crossing

30:53.900 --> 30:58.060
history. I finally have a fricking penguin in my town. Thank you very much. Um, but you can

30:58.060 --> 31:02.460
talk to them and they'll, they'll move into the empty house if you want them to. Well, he went to

31:02.460 --> 31:09.900
an island and he realized that he was fishing up nothing but garbage. He was on garbage Island and

31:09.900 --> 31:15.900
Jamie, guess what villager was living on garbage Island? I think I know. Yeah. If you look to chat,

31:15.900 --> 31:22.700
you probably know it was Ed. Ed, Ed lives on garbage Island. Ed is full of garbage.

31:23.340 --> 31:28.940
I ran into Ed at somebody's, somebody else's, uh, town and I wish he'd been outside because

31:28.940 --> 31:33.660
I would have beaten him to shit with a bug net or, or tried to ax him or something.

31:33.660 --> 31:37.180
My friend that I visited the other day had Dina and I thought of you. Um,

31:37.180 --> 31:41.660
she gave me a recipe. She was very nice. You know what? I have the card for Dina.

31:42.620 --> 31:49.100
I'm getting a spare Dina of which when it arrives, I'm giving it to you. Oh, um,

31:50.060 --> 31:54.700
I I've already given out my other spare cards except some of my specials,

31:54.700 --> 32:01.580
but I discovered something as well. I have one Sanrio card. I have the 12 card,

32:01.580 --> 32:07.900
which is the, the, the little twin stars. And I got it because I wanted, um, I was going to do,

32:08.860 --> 32:15.260
the, uh, amiibo thing on new leaf. Um, and I wanted a 12, you know, the little twin star set

32:15.260 --> 32:20.860
and it never did it. And when I saw that you can use the little twin stars amiibo cards,

32:20.860 --> 32:26.460
I was like, Oh shit. And I found where my card went. And so what happens is that if you've got

32:26.460 --> 32:30.220
villagers that you want to summon from amiibo cards that you can't thumb and like,

32:30.220 --> 32:34.780
you can't bring in at 12 and you can't do Digby or reset or any of those, you know,

32:35.660 --> 32:42.460
when you still scan the amiibo card, you, when you get back on your, uh, your nook

32:42.460 --> 32:46.700
kiosk thing, when you go into do a special order, you now have a place for posters.

32:48.060 --> 32:52.140
Yep. So I have a little twin stars poster.

32:52.140 --> 32:55.500
That's awesome. See, okay. We need to do a little amiibo trading that I don't know.

32:55.500 --> 32:59.740
Maybe I have some figures you don't have. Cause I I'm obsessed with those little posters. I

32:59.740 --> 33:03.100
have a room that has a bunch of them in it. Um, so I have like those little,

33:03.100 --> 33:08.220
those little goats that are friends. I have them cause some of them form like super posters.

33:08.220 --> 33:12.540
So you there there's, um, use the Tom Nook amiibo and then the Timmy and Tommy amiibo.

33:12.540 --> 33:16.140
And it's three posters and they go together to form like a super poster.

33:16.140 --> 33:20.380
It's really, I need to put it back in cause I have the Timmy and Nook and I need to rescan

33:20.380 --> 33:28.700
my Nooklings for Tommy. Um, but right now, um, I have a reset poster in my house. I have a DJ

33:28.700 --> 33:33.100
KK downstairs. I have, you know, my regular KK and I have my little, and it actually,

33:33.100 --> 33:39.660
the little twin stars one is Timmy and Tommy as a Kiki Lala and Rob, I will absolutely order you

33:39.660 --> 33:45.980
a poster tomorrow. Um, I think I used up my, my orders, but I'm also willing to say that if any

33:45.980 --> 33:54.220
of our listeners, you know, if you want a Kiki Lala poster over, I'll say the next two weeks,

33:54.220 --> 34:01.980
I will give out four of them and you have to message me on Twitter and we'll, we'll work out

34:01.980 --> 34:08.220
the code or the dodo code or whatever. And you can't give out that code to anybody, but I will,

34:08.220 --> 34:13.500
I will make sure that you get a Kiki Lala poster or one of Timmy and Tommy is Kiki Lala.

34:13.500 --> 34:19.660
Fun. All right. All right. Well, let's move on. I think we've talked a lot of animal crossing,

34:19.660 --> 34:23.500
but I know it's, it's, it's not enough. You can't get away from it. It's everywhere.

34:23.500 --> 34:26.860
Anyway. Uh, Loki, maybe, maybe your week was filled with animal crossing too. I don't know.

34:26.860 --> 34:31.020
How was your gaming week? No, I have still not touched animal crossing, unfortunately,

34:31.020 --> 34:35.980
even though I have it. Um, no, this week was pretty much just step mania. I've been,

34:35.980 --> 34:42.060
you know, still trying to curate my, uh, song list and keep adding to it. They have too many

34:42.060 --> 34:46.940
songs in there. And so right now, mainly just trying to get the repeats out of there and,

34:47.020 --> 34:53.580
um, trying to take out stuff that's just ridiculously, like irritating or just,

34:53.580 --> 34:59.100
you know, uh, the steps are ridiculous on them. Um, cause going through his stuff,

34:59.100 --> 35:03.660
there's a lot of, I know like folks love doing like step files for anime music. And

35:04.700 --> 35:12.780
I mean, it's fine, but like when you have like 500 songs of like various anime tracks

35:12.780 --> 35:18.940
for animes I've never seen, like that's too much or like even like hardcore techno or,

35:18.940 --> 35:24.620
and you, uh, rave music and stuff. It's like, okay. It's just so much of it just sounds the

35:24.620 --> 35:31.260
same. Like I need to whittle down some of that stuff so that it's not so crazy. Um,

35:32.540 --> 35:37.980
so yeah, so I've been doing that, um, and actually playing some of it as well. Um,

35:38.700 --> 35:44.220
and then aside from step mania, I've been playing a little bit of stuff on my PC. So I played

35:44.220 --> 35:49.500
Minecraft this week as well. Uh, we were playing with my kids this morning and so I have a realm,

35:49.500 --> 35:55.580
it's kind of like a server, um, that we all play as a family. And so they wanted to go

35:55.580 --> 36:00.380
kill the other dragon. So we found the, uh, fortress and, or I'm sorry. Yeah,

36:00.380 --> 36:05.580
I think it's a stronghold. And we went to the end and, uh, killed the under dragon as a family.

36:05.580 --> 36:10.540
So that was kind of fun. And then, uh, what else? Uh, look played a little bit of earth

36:10.540 --> 36:16.780
defense force, iron rain, uh, because I picked that up on a steam sale at some point. And so,

36:16.780 --> 36:21.820
uh, of course, you know, I love my earth defense force games and that one's kind of ridiculous as

36:21.820 --> 36:26.940
well, but it's, it's a fancier looking earth defense force. So, um, I like that. The only

36:26.940 --> 36:31.660
thing I didn't quite care for is a lot of those games are kind of shoddily put together. So

36:32.620 --> 36:39.340
for whatever reason, it like, it really wants to play on my laptop monitor, which I have two

36:39.340 --> 36:44.540
dedicated monitors, you know, at my desk and it's just trying to play on the side here.

36:44.540 --> 36:49.020
So I have to disable my laptop, uh, display in order for it to play on the right screen,

36:49.020 --> 36:55.180
which is stupid. Absolutely dumb, but it's earth defense force. So what are you going to do?

36:56.620 --> 37:00.140
So that's pretty much it. All right. Sounds like you've had a pretty, pretty busy week.

37:00.140 --> 37:04.140
I love that story of killing the ender dragon as a family. That's adorable.

37:04.140 --> 37:09.100
Uh, some people play board games, your family kills dragons. That's cool. Uh, so, uh, my gaming

37:09.100 --> 37:13.180
week. So yeah, I've had some time to play video games. Um, so I'm still playing a lot of final

37:13.180 --> 37:18.140
fantasy 14, cause that's my MMO time seek of choice. Um, and I've also been playing animal

37:18.140 --> 37:22.700
crossing, just like dark Sakura, probably not as much as star Sakura. Although I also,

37:22.700 --> 37:27.180
today was my KK to concert actually this morning when I signed in to get the turnips,

37:27.180 --> 37:31.340
I got the KK concert, which is when the credits roll. So does that mean I beat animal crossing?

37:31.340 --> 37:35.180
Can I count that as IB animal crossing for the year? Cause you finished the storyline.

37:35.180 --> 37:38.780
Okay. Like, like you were saying, you're now in end game. I'm in the end game now. Yeah,

37:38.780 --> 37:41.980
no, but I I've been, uh, I've been getting a little more into the gardening thing. So I'm

37:41.980 --> 37:46.380
starting to collect the flowers. Like you brought me like blue pansies, I think. And so I've been

37:46.380 --> 37:50.300
trying to set up those efficient cross breeding gardens. You've probably seen some of the pictures

37:50.300 --> 37:55.420
floating around out there. Um, so, and I, I have a cute little area. I've been really into

37:55.420 --> 38:00.540
customizing the things I build. Like I did not realize like, Oh, not only can you build a

38:00.540 --> 38:03.900
fountain, but you can paint it black. And I was like, Ooh, so I set up this whole little like

38:03.900 --> 38:07.900
garden and I love it. So, um, yeah, you'll have to, you'll have to come see what I did dark Sakura.

38:07.900 --> 38:12.060
Cause I kind of changed a lot in that. And I finally got able sisters, which I know you

38:12.060 --> 38:18.460
were looking for last time. So, uh, that is there. Hey, if, if during your lunch tomorrow, cause I,

38:18.460 --> 38:22.380
I had already taken two days off for my birthday because I was supposed to be in San Francisco,

38:22.380 --> 38:31.260
but no disease. Thank you dump anyway. Um, but, um, tomorrow we'll have to, um, to do some cross

38:31.260 --> 38:35.500
visiting so that we can see each other's new changes. Cause like I said, I've done a lot of

38:35.500 --> 38:40.060
work in my town. Yeah. So, and then I built himself a redneck paradise. I just unlocked

38:40.060 --> 38:45.180
all that terraforming. So now, and now I'm, I had like 40,000 miles in storage cause I never go to

38:45.180 --> 38:49.100
the islands. So like, I'm like, Oh, I'm buying that. I'm buying that. I'm buying that. So yeah,

38:49.340 --> 38:54.460
you'll have to see anyway. Um, I also, I keep thinking I'm going to do a stream on my personal

38:54.460 --> 38:58.860
channel and I will get to it. Here's what's kind of been slowing me down on streaming on my

38:58.860 --> 39:05.660
personal channel. I've actually had to use some of the equipment to set up my work stuff on my,

39:05.660 --> 39:11.020
in my personal office. Some of like the splitters and HDMI cables and stuff are actually making me

39:11.020 --> 39:15.260
able to work in my office. So if you're wondering like why I haven't streamed in a long time,

39:15.260 --> 39:19.020
that is a big part of the reason, but I need to just fix all that. Cause I really want to do

39:19.020 --> 39:23.500
like a stream where I visit people's animal crossing towns, uh, and, uh, hit their villagers

39:23.500 --> 39:29.100
with bug nets. No, I'm kidding. I'll be respectful. It'd be fun. So, uh, yeah. Um, there's that. So,

39:29.100 --> 39:34.060
uh, I, I've been making progress in animal crossing, which is cool. I've also been playing

39:34.060 --> 39:40.620
a crap ton of final fantasy seven remake. Still haven't beaten it yet, but I'm at least 20 hours

39:40.620 --> 39:49.660
in I'm thinking beyond that. And I am in chapter 13, 14, maybe I don't, I just opened up a lot of

39:49.660 --> 39:54.780
sub quests and that is probably what I can say without spoiling. Cause obviously I'm not going

39:54.780 --> 39:59.420
to be that guy who spoils, uh, how can you spoil a game that is so many years old and just being

39:59.420 --> 40:04.460
remade because, and I said this last week and I'll say it again because not enough people understand

40:04.460 --> 40:11.820
this final fantasy seven remake is not the same story. I mean, it kinda, it's the same plot.

40:11.820 --> 40:17.660
It's the same characters, but they've changed quite a bit. And so if you're again going,

40:17.660 --> 40:22.380
well, I'm not going to play a game. That's only a quarter of the experience. You're wrong.

40:24.140 --> 40:28.140
It's it's it's you're, you're thinking of it, not the right, you're not putting it in the right

40:28.140 --> 40:35.100
framing because it's not a one for one remake of the original whatsoever. It is completely a new,

40:35.100 --> 40:38.540
uh, plot because they have fleshed things out and all that good stuff are really good.

40:38.540 --> 40:43.100
So I was making comparisons on last week's show and a really good one came up on Bobby

40:43.100 --> 40:47.420
Black Wolf show from pod culture. And I think this is the best comparison I've heard yet.

40:48.060 --> 40:54.380
It's the battle star Galactica 70 series and the battle star Galactica reboot series.

40:55.180 --> 40:59.420
They're different. There's a lot of similarities, a lot, a lot of similar characters, a lot of

40:59.420 --> 41:04.140
things, but a lot's changed for one. The special effects are much better in the newer version.

41:05.020 --> 41:10.700
So I think that was a really, really good, um, comparison. Um, Tiger claw and chat says,

41:10.700 --> 41:15.820
does a certain character meet the same fate? Um, I don't know yet because it has not been addressed

41:15.820 --> 41:20.780
in the story. And even if I did know, I was not, I would never spoil for the listeners and, uh,

41:20.780 --> 41:25.260
we'll, we'll, we'll find out, uh, play the game and find out. And maybe in six months,

41:25.260 --> 41:29.340
we can talk a little more openly about it when, uh, enough people have played it at this point.

41:29.340 --> 41:36.300
Um, let's see, um, going to chat for some other comments, uh, Phoenix 77 26 says,

41:36.300 --> 41:40.460
I wonder if they will make certain decisions in that game again, or if certain party members will

41:40.460 --> 41:45.100
stay until the end, Rob, I don't know. It depends. It depends. I don't know what they're going to do

41:45.100 --> 41:50.700
for the future episodes. Um, because there's really only four playable characters in this game.

41:51.260 --> 41:55.340
Um, and so I don't know what's going to happen when you open up things like Vincent Yuffie and,

41:55.340 --> 42:00.300
uh, Sid and like all the characters you get later on. Oh yeah. And that was, that was the thing too,

42:00.300 --> 42:07.820
is member. You could also get you earlier in the game, um, in Midgar actually in the original that

42:07.820 --> 42:14.940
is rare to do that, but you could do it. Yeah. So I, the answer, the answer is I don't know. And I,

42:14.940 --> 42:20.780
again, I think it is incorrect to assume because anything happened in the original,

42:20.780 --> 42:25.020
it's going to happen the same way in this one. This game makes it very clear. They're not going

42:25.020 --> 42:30.300
to follow the exact same script. Um, so they're going to do their own thing. So we, we, we really

42:30.300 --> 42:34.140
don't know. So what's going to happen in that department. Uh, maybe there'll be new characters

42:34.140 --> 42:41.500
you can play. Who knows? Um, I, uh, what, what, Oh, I will say this. So, um, they've said openly,

42:41.500 --> 42:49.020
you know, you know, you can play Aerith Barrett, uh, Tifa cloud, and then red 13 is there,

42:49.020 --> 42:53.820
but you, he's a guest character. They've said that in pre-release interviews. I'm not like spoiling

42:53.820 --> 42:58.060
anything. They haven't talked about openly the official staff before the game came out. It's

42:58.060 --> 43:02.860
pretty limited to those characters. However, another character, and this is the part I am

43:02.860 --> 43:07.660
going to leave vague, did show up in a cut scene. And I was like, like, I was like, I,

43:07.660 --> 43:12.140
I was not expecting to see that. And it was, it was, it was like a blink and you'll miss it thing.

43:12.140 --> 43:18.300
And I was like, that's, that's, and that was it. So, uh, there's, and I don't think in the

43:18.300 --> 43:23.580
original, the character was in the Midgar part of the story. So I'm there's again,

43:23.580 --> 43:29.900
they're doing their own thing and I think it's great. So, um, Phoenix 77 26 says, Rob,

43:29.900 --> 43:33.580
do we know when the next episode is coming out? No, we don't. And we don't even know if they're

43:33.580 --> 43:40.380
calling it an episode. They're going to do their own thing and that's fine. So, um, anyhow, so

43:40.380 --> 43:45.900
that's enough on Final Fantasy 7 Remake. I'm, I'm still loving it. Um, oh no, I should say one other

43:45.900 --> 43:50.460
thing because I think now some things where I could see like some criticisms of the game,

43:50.460 --> 43:58.540
um, not so much the story, but I did notice in playing chapters 10 and 11, some of it started

43:58.540 --> 44:03.100
to feel, and Alan was actually watching me play because, um, Alan wanted to see a certain sequence

44:03.100 --> 44:07.660
that happened in the game. And then it led into chapters 10 and 11. And even he had kind of

44:07.660 --> 44:11.500
commented like, this is getting to be a little like these maps are getting a little long. Like

44:11.500 --> 44:16.220
these, this is getting a little samey what you're doing. And I would say it was starting to get

44:16.220 --> 44:20.700
luckily the game picked up again, but it was starting to feel a little bit grindy and a little

44:20.700 --> 44:25.580
bit like, okay, this is getting a little like, yeah. Um, and then the other thing I think is

44:25.580 --> 44:29.180
that really needs to be brought up about Final Fantasy 7 Remake is that

44:30.140 --> 44:34.940
a lot of people that are praising Final Fantasy 7 Remake, and I'm not saying Final Fantasy 7 Remake

44:34.940 --> 44:39.900
isn't deserving of lots of praise. I'm praising it. It's a great game, but it is fascinating to

44:39.900 --> 44:46.860
me. How many people are praising 7 Remake who completely took a shit on Final Fantasy 13?

44:48.300 --> 44:55.020
Because I'm gonna tell you what, Final Fantasy 7 Remake almost has just as much in common

44:55.020 --> 45:02.380
with Final Fantasy 13 as it does with Final Fantasy 7. You'll see what I mean when you get

45:02.380 --> 45:08.860
around to playing it. But part of it is some of the maps do get kind of linear, except you might

45:08.860 --> 45:13.420
have a little branching path that takes you to a treasure chest. But like, I'm kind of surprised.

45:13.420 --> 45:19.660
And again, it didn't bother me in 13, because I still felt like there was enough like progression.

45:19.660 --> 45:22.860
There was enough where it kind of fit the narrative and the story they were trying to tell

45:22.860 --> 45:28.860
like the the linearity in Final Fantasy 13 didn't really bother me. But I want to be clear,

45:28.860 --> 45:35.100
it's no better in Final Fantasy 7 Remake. So it's interesting to me how people that were really

45:35.100 --> 45:40.620
bothered by... I really think if you play Final Fantasy 7 Remake and you finish it and all that

45:40.620 --> 45:45.980
stuff, you should go back and play Final Fantasy 13 and reevaluate some of your feelings on Final

45:45.980 --> 45:51.660
Fantasy 13. Because I think that game, I think time will treat that game more favorably than

45:51.660 --> 45:55.980
what it got when it first came out. I think as people go back and play it again. That whole

45:55.980 --> 46:02.540
stagger mechanic that's in Final Fantasy 7 Remake, guess what game that came from? 13. So, you know,

46:02.540 --> 46:07.420
put some put some respect on Final Fantasy 13's name. That's what I'm saying. And what a perfect

46:07.420 --> 46:12.620
time to re-release the trilogy, although I don't think Square Enix has any plans to. But if I

46:12.620 --> 46:20.940
remember right, at the end of last year, Microsoft said at least 13 would be coming to Game Pass at

46:20.940 --> 46:25.020
some point. I don't know about 13 to enlightening returns. I can't recall if that was included.

46:25.740 --> 46:31.180
But we should be seeing at some point 13 hit Microsoft Game Pass. So if you happen to have

46:31.180 --> 46:36.780
that, what a great opportunity to revisit, hopefully coming soon. I don't know. We'll see.

46:38.220 --> 46:42.300
So some comments in chat because I knew my hot take would get some comments here in chat.

46:42.860 --> 46:48.540
Bobby Blackwell says, it's very corridor heavy. I enjoyed 13. Akuma JP says, nope, Rob, you're

46:48.540 --> 46:54.940
wrong. How dare you? Final Fantasy 13 has shitty story. Final Fantasy 13 battle is shitty without

46:54.940 --> 47:00.220
materia. Final Fantasy 13 has shitty dialogue. Final Fantasy 13 says has shitty character

47:00.220 --> 47:06.860
except lightning. But Final Fantasy 13 also has a decent ending. And I don't know if I

47:06.860 --> 47:11.820
necessarily agree. I enjoyed the battles, to be honest. I don't. Yeah. So anyway.

47:12.780 --> 47:18.780
VG Realness says, I never understood why people complain about Final Fantasy games being linear.

47:18.780 --> 47:24.300
They always were. I know I personally dislike 13 for other reasons. And that's fine. Again,

47:24.300 --> 47:29.820
people can have their own opinions on games. It's fine. But it's just interesting to me sometimes

47:29.820 --> 47:34.460
how the criteria here doesn't match the criteria here all the time. But that's fine. If you didn't

47:34.460 --> 47:39.500
like the story and you didn't like the characters, I don't think I can like change your mind on that.

47:39.660 --> 47:44.380
That's just one of those things that's open to interpretation like any movie or book or what

47:44.380 --> 47:47.820
have you. It's just going to click for some people. It's not going to click for other people.

47:47.820 --> 47:53.820
And I will say Final Fantasy 13 did get a little alphabet soupy with some of their,

47:53.820 --> 47:59.980
like the lacy and the falcie. And it did get a little, okay, I'll give you that. It got a

47:59.980 --> 48:06.540
little crazy with all that stuff. So it's fine. VG Realness says, I mean, name a Final Fantasy

48:06.540 --> 48:13.180
game prior to 15 that was not linear. 14 and 11, the MMOs. Okay. If I can't count those though,

48:13.180 --> 48:16.380
yeah, no. I mean, even go back to the very first Final Fantasy. You're right.

48:17.020 --> 48:22.380
A lot of that game's design is very gated. It's like you have this part of the map and then you're

48:22.380 --> 48:25.740
going to go to this dungeon and get the dynamite that opens this part of the map. And then you're

48:25.740 --> 48:29.100
going to go to this dungeon and get the canoe that opens this part of the map. And then you're going

48:29.100 --> 48:32.060
to go get the boat that opens this part of the map. And then the airship that opens this part

48:32.060 --> 48:35.740
of that. You're right. Final Fantasy games have kind of been linear in design for a very long

48:35.740 --> 48:43.660
time. So VG Realness says about the MMOs, they don't count. Don't get cute. I can't help it.

48:43.660 --> 48:48.700
I was born cute. All right. That's enough of my gaming week. Uh, let's talk about some other stuff

48:48.700 --> 48:54.060
like what's going on in the news. So, uh, Loki, if you didn't fall asleep during my rants,

48:54.060 --> 49:00.300
why don't you start us off with some gaming news? Um, so like this isn't a really big surprise,

49:00.380 --> 49:04.860
but apparently, uh, Sony is, they're saying they're going to be making fewer PlayStation

49:04.860 --> 49:12.140
fives this year. Um, due to its price, basically, um, you know, the thought is that a lot of these

49:12.140 --> 49:16.060
consoles might be a little bit behind in production because of the whole COVID-19 thing

49:16.060 --> 49:20.460
and folks not being able to return to work and that kind of stuff. But apparently they're saying

49:20.460 --> 49:28.700
that, um, they're expecting that the pricing of course is going to be a factor in, um, not being

49:28.700 --> 49:32.940
able to manufacture these units. I'm guessing maybe because the longer that they wait or because

49:32.940 --> 49:37.660
production right now is impacted by that, there's high prices for that stuff. We don't even really

49:37.660 --> 49:43.100
know what the price of the console is going to be yet, but we'll have to see. Um, right now they're

49:43.660 --> 49:47.820
been telling their partners that they're going to make between five to 6 million PlayStation fives

49:47.820 --> 49:53.980
during the financial year, which is, I mean, uh, March 31st of next year. And apparently they've

49:53.980 --> 49:59.020
sold of course more than that for like PlayStation three and four and stuff within the first two

49:59.020 --> 50:07.820
quarters. So, um, I don't know. I mean, I think a lot of these stories seem to be just, let's

50:07.820 --> 50:12.860
speculate on stuff because we got nothing to go with. Cause it's slow. No, I think there is

50:12.860 --> 50:17.020
definitely some of that coming into play, but I think, I think like, I think people are already

50:17.020 --> 50:22.460
concerned about how might the COVID situation and how it impacts the various factories and all

50:22.460 --> 50:26.460
these different countries that produce products. How is that going to ultimately play out in the

50:26.460 --> 50:30.940
situation? But I think it's interesting about this. Um, buzz, if you, I don't know what else

50:30.940 --> 50:35.500
to call it a rumors, you know, what have you, uh, admittedly, uh, what's interesting about it is

50:35.500 --> 50:39.180
that they aren't really blaming the COVID situation, but they're saying because these,

50:39.180 --> 50:43.820
these parts are still very expensive and they're not projected to come down in price for a little

50:43.820 --> 50:49.420
bit. Uh, Sony is like, kind of like purposefully making less of it. So that way it doesn't feel

50:49.420 --> 50:53.500
like they're like, like the store shelves are full of them and it's not selling well, I guess

50:53.500 --> 50:56.540
that's kind of what I'm reading. I don't think it's necessarily that they're saying that

50:56.540 --> 51:00.620
basically certain components are scarce and expensive, which would cut into the company's

51:00.620 --> 51:06.460
profits. So they're basically holding back on producing a large number of these right now,

51:06.460 --> 51:12.300
while the component pricing is high and waiting to produce more, once all that stuff settles down

51:12.300 --> 51:16.780
and everybody's back to work and then all the pricing will come down. Yeah. And I was to say

51:16.780 --> 51:21.340
that would make more sense is that during this COVID situation, like, you know, technology gets

51:21.340 --> 51:25.420
cheaper and cheaper and cheaper is the usual trajectory. Right. But during this situation,

51:25.420 --> 51:30.060
that's probably not happening. And so maybe that's kind of throwing off Sony's patterns as to

51:30.060 --> 51:33.820
how much money are we going to make off this console and when, and all that stuff,

51:33.820 --> 51:38.140
um, as Joanna. No, go ahead. I was going to say, and we have to even see when it's going to come

51:38.140 --> 51:43.180
out because right now we're targeting the end of the year, but I mean, there's no, that's not set

51:43.180 --> 51:48.780
in stone. So we'll have to see. Absolutely. I mean, depending on how this whole COVID stuff

51:48.780 --> 51:54.140
plays out, which we just don't know, you know, especially if the recent wave of, you know,

51:54.140 --> 51:58.700
and again, I'm, I'm really trying not to go there on the show, but this, it is the reality and could

51:58.700 --> 52:03.740
have an effect on games and stuff. But if this recent wave of people clearly not giving a fuck

52:03.740 --> 52:09.260
anymore and just wanting to go out in mass and like, you know, I would rather make money, uh,

52:09.340 --> 52:16.300
for my boss than, uh, be healthy and all this stuff. If this plays into this situation,

52:16.300 --> 52:21.820
just getting drawn out longer, uh, because a second wave ends up happening, like what happened,

52:21.820 --> 52:29.020
uh, in the 19 hundreds with that flu pandemic, um, then maybe we're not going to see this end

52:29.020 --> 52:33.260
by September or October, which is when you would expect a new console to come out.

52:34.140 --> 52:37.980
Well, also something to add with that too. I'm glad that you brought that up because with these,

52:37.980 --> 52:45.340
uh, I'm just going to say it with these absolute idiots. I hate using the word, but they're

52:45.340 --> 52:52.220
idiots. Um, people who are trying to protest about going back to work, um, they don't seem to realize

52:52.220 --> 52:57.500
that yes, in 1918, when they, uh, during the height of the Spanish flu, when, um, after the

52:57.500 --> 53:02.220
end of world war, world war one, yeah. When, um, you know, the rates were going down, people were

53:02.220 --> 53:07.740
getting better. The moment they had a big massive celebration for the end of world war one,

53:07.740 --> 53:13.260
guess what happened? The pandemic spiked even higher than it did before resulting in,

53:14.060 --> 53:19.100
I would, I think it was like another 20% more deaths than the first spike had cost.

53:20.860 --> 53:26.220
Yeah. And it's just, I, I, I understand, like, I understand the frustrations where people like,

53:26.220 --> 53:30.540
you know, are like, they're not able to work right now, you know, especially in people that are in

53:30.540 --> 53:35.740
like the bar industry or the entertainment or the, you know, um, live concert type of experience

53:35.740 --> 53:39.980
stuff. Uh, you know, these people are not able to work right now and I understand those frustrations,

53:39.980 --> 53:44.620
but at the same time, I don't, for me, and I guess now this is a political issue,

53:44.620 --> 53:50.780
which is so weird to think, cause I didn't think this should be, but clearly, but like,

53:50.780 --> 53:54.300
instead of begging to go back to work and expose all these people to this,

53:54.300 --> 53:59.180
why aren't we protesting that the government should be providing for us?

53:59.180 --> 54:03.420
Exactly. Well, and that should be the protest, shouldn't it? I don't know. This is weird.

54:04.140 --> 54:07.340
One thing that I tried to tell my mom too, is she's like, Oh, you know,

54:07.340 --> 54:11.340
she's one of those good old days, kind of, Oh, the fifties, blah, blah, blah, you know?

54:11.900 --> 54:17.180
And she doesn't like when I point out to her the tax rates that we were, that, that America

54:17.180 --> 54:23.500
in general had in the fifties and that we were coming right out of FDR's new deal. He's like,

54:23.500 --> 54:28.140
Oh, but, but the last two months, you can't say that you want things to go back to the

54:28.140 --> 54:34.940
prosperity that we had before yet vote against the things that made us have that prosperity before.

54:36.620 --> 54:40.060
Yeah. You cut out there. Did you have anything else?

54:40.940 --> 54:41.660
Um, no.

54:41.660 --> 54:46.140
Okay. Sorry. Um, so, um, anyway, I, sorry, I didn't mean to get tangenty,

54:46.140 --> 54:49.500
but it's going to happen with everything that's going on in the world. Sorry. But I mean,

54:49.500 --> 54:55.340
and like I said, it could affect all of this because if we, if we do not succeed in eradicating

54:55.340 --> 55:00.700
this or minimizing it to a traceable testable thing that's controlled, let's say, uh, within

55:00.700 --> 55:04.940
the next couple of months, then we could be looking at things in the fall, get pushed back

55:04.940 --> 55:08.860
to, and we don't get new game consoles because you know, companies don't want to risk that type

55:08.860 --> 55:12.940
of financial state or whatever. Um, because that should not be the type of stuff that we're rushing

55:12.940 --> 55:18.220
to target to get. Uh, as somebody is pointing out in chat, Phoenix 77 26 says, I get those,

55:18.220 --> 55:22.140
but then you have asses whining about how they can't get fertilizer for their hobby garden,

55:22.140 --> 55:26.300
or can't get their hair cut or some ass, nine shit like that. And that's, that's the thing is

55:26.300 --> 55:32.380
that, you know, essential means essential, right? So, um, video game consoles, I'm sorry,

55:32.380 --> 55:37.820
they're not, they're not essential. You probably have a gigantic backlog of games on steam and so

55:37.820 --> 55:42.300
forth. Um, or you know what, let me, let me introduce you to a fantastic website. It's called

55:42.300 --> 55:51.500
itch.io and games as far as the eye can see low cost and free that will keep you busy for the next

55:51.500 --> 55:58.540
10 years if you want it to, uh, even that might remind everybody that Ludum Dari is this weekend

55:58.540 --> 56:02.700
as well. There is going to be literally hundreds of games available for you to play. And plus all

56:02.700 --> 56:07.740
those other game jam games from previous tons of game jams all the time, free games all around.

56:08.300 --> 56:13.820
Yeah. So we don't, we don't need a PlayStation five this year. Sure. It would be nice as a

56:13.820 --> 56:19.340
gaming fan. I would welcome that, but I understand there's a lot of crazy shit going on in the world

56:19.340 --> 56:24.860
right now. And if the PlayStation five doesn't happen as a result this year, I'll be okay. I,

56:24.860 --> 56:32.860
I got food and water. I'll be okay. So it's yeah. Anyway, we'll see, we'll see what happens though,

56:32.860 --> 56:39.260
as, um, you know, the, the, the weeks and so forth continue. And, uh, especially if Sony is kind of

56:39.260 --> 56:43.820
running up against the clock to maybe announce some of this stuff, a lot of folks expecting

56:43.820 --> 56:49.420
that Sony would announce things in a June timeframe because June would have been E3.

56:49.420 --> 56:54.620
June is typically the month when these things are unveiled. Although I suppose if Sony shown

56:54.620 --> 56:58.540
anything in the past couple of years, it is that they're going to do whatever the fuck they want

56:58.540 --> 57:04.460
and they're going to do it on their timetable. So, um, do we expect a Loki or dark side? Do we

57:04.460 --> 57:08.620
expect Sony to make an announcement in June or, or do we think that doesn't even happen at this

57:08.620 --> 57:13.900
point? Um, it, I think it's going to happen at some point they're going to have some sort of

57:13.900 --> 57:18.540
announcements, but yeah, a lot of these, they don't really seem to have much of a digital

57:19.580 --> 57:25.500
plan for, um, well, aside from what IGN is supposed to be doing for that, but like,

57:25.500 --> 57:29.340
there's not really anything been announced yet for that. And I don't know if they're in a big

57:29.340 --> 57:36.220
hurry to do that. Um, I don't know. I hope we get some announcements. I think it would

57:36.220 --> 57:41.180
behoove them though, to try to keep some kind of hype running, you know,

57:41.180 --> 57:44.940
I think that's also why we are getting a little bit, we are getting kind of like the drip feed

57:44.940 --> 57:50.060
of like, for example, we had that Mark Cerny, uh, game developer conference, uh, clearly crafted

57:50.060 --> 57:55.980
presentation that came out. We just had a game that's getting up, up dude for PlayStation five,

57:55.980 --> 58:00.220
had a trailer come out this week. And, uh, so it's showing off a little bit of what the PlayStation

58:00.220 --> 58:04.940
five can do. Uh, that was available. So I, I do feel like they're still going to kind of like

58:04.940 --> 58:09.580
drip feed us little bits and pieces here and there, but as for the big unveil, who knows?

58:09.580 --> 58:14.300
And I think SGL 100 Matt has an excellent point in chat. It's kind of bad timing to announce a

58:14.300 --> 58:19.740
price for things when people are struggling to pay rent. I don't even know if June is the time,

58:19.740 --> 58:24.700
like Loki is saying they don't need to rush. And that's a very good point as well is that, um,

58:25.340 --> 58:31.900
it might be kind of tacky of Sony to announce something like that until we have a solution for,

58:31.900 --> 58:38.540
you know, when will things start to get back to some sense of normalcy and when will

58:38.540 --> 58:42.220
the majority of people be able to go back to work and some of those things get answered?

58:42.220 --> 58:46.540
I don't know. Um, I would hope by June, we're starting to get to some of those questions, but

58:46.540 --> 58:50.380
I will listen to the West coast governors on that because they're listening to scientists.

58:51.100 --> 58:57.580
So I don't think normal is going to exist. Well, that's why I said some sense of normal.

58:58.540 --> 59:02.620
This is the new normal. I really think this is it. This is the new normal.

59:02.620 --> 59:05.340
I don't think shelter in place is the normal forever.

59:06.700 --> 59:11.100
I think some things are going to be different, but I, and like mass gatherings may still be

59:11.100 --> 59:15.980
impacted for a while. I think conventions and Disneyland and those sorts of things could be,

59:15.980 --> 59:21.260
uh, on hold for a lot longer. But I think, I mean, it just, it all depends on the testing.

59:21.260 --> 59:25.500
It depends on the testing and tracking. That's what it boils down to. Uh, listen to those, uh,

59:25.500 --> 59:30.860
six points that the governor laid out previously. I think they will start to open restaurants and,

59:30.860 --> 59:34.940
you know, allow you to go visit friends and things like that, but it's going to be situations where

59:34.940 --> 59:40.780
the contacts are traceable when it comes down to, but anyway, um, yeah, I agree with Bobby.

59:40.780 --> 59:45.420
There's no way we're going to shelter in place until fall of 2021. I just, that's not what I

59:45.420 --> 59:52.860
meant. Okay. I mean that it's the taking extra precautions, having more social, um, windfalls,

59:52.940 --> 59:56.540
especially here in California. I think that they're really going to, I honestly think that

59:56.540 --> 01:00:02.540
we're going to get a, uh, quite a bit more of a, uh, a socialist turn in some of this because we

01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:07.740
are enacting more and more policies now to protect people who have no means of,

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:12.460
of their livelihood anymore. And I think we're going to start to see things like, um,

01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:17.580
a little bit more involvement and hopefully on a national scale, I'd really like for us to see

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:25.580
more of a, uh, what's the word I'm thinking of more, um, foresight more, um, uh, gosh,

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:29.980
I can't think of the word right now when you're, um, when you're ahead of the curve, you know,

01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:36.860
for when you're prepared. Yeah. Yeah. Not the word I was thinking of, but it's kind of like that

01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:42.620
anyway, but that's, um, I'm having word problems. Um, but I think that we're hopefully that we're

01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:46.700
going to see, we're going to actually learn from this. I mean, not with, of course,

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:52.380
the current administration, but I also think that we might, there's going to be a big turn against

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:58.540
that kind of backwards thought. We're going to start seeing people look more appreciatively at

01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:03.020
those who provide the services of, of, of our country. I really do hope so. That's what I'm

01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:09.100
thinking is going to be the new normal. Oops, I hit my button by accident. Um, the new normal

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:15.500
is going to be that we, we also hopefully we'll do a lot more for each other and live more frugally

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:20.300
that we're not going to be as we need, need, need, need, need all of this stuff.

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:25.260
When we know that it's not a need, it's a want, and we have bigger things that we need to be

01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:30.540
worrying about just saying, and this is me as a gamer saying this. Yeah. So that made sense.

01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:35.020
Yeah, no, I get it. I get it. Anyway, I'm trying again, it's, it's hard for the subject not to come

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:39.500
up, but I mean, it is impacting the video games that we're talking about. And, you know, I think

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:44.300
a lot of these expectations as gamers of, Oh, things are announced in June and dah, dah, dah,

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:47.820
like this is all up in the air due to this situation, which you just kind of like have

01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:54.300
to understand, um, you know, that, that if anything is the new normal, it's uncertainty

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:58.540
and uncertainty is that normal, you know, so not everything is necessarily going to go

01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:05.500
according to a whatever, whatever type of plan. Um, also I think worth pointing out,

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:11.740
remember the Nintendo switch, Nintendo switch, what they announced that in early January.

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:15.740
And it locked cause it was right after new year's day. It was around like January

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:20.220
seventh or so they announced that. And then it launched in what, like early March.

01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:26.300
So not even like two months between announcement and launch and the Nintendo switch has done very,

01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:33.340
very well. So there's nothing to say that Sony couldn't announce in September and then launch

01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:37.500
it in November, two months be plenty of time for them. I don't know if that's what the investors

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:45.420
would like, but they could do it could happen. We'll see anyhow. All right, let's move on,

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:52.940
get into some other topics. Uh, let's talk about Facebook, uh, which I know, I know in some ways

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:57.340
I'm like, I'd rather not, because if you want to talk about where a lot of this misinformation

01:02:57.340 --> 01:03:02.700
and people going crazy and, and 5g caused this and all this stuff, I mean, look at Facebook,

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:08.060
like where does, where does all that BS said about that, Rob, about, about certain technologies

01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:14.460
causing problems like this. Um, electricity. Yeah. Anyway, it's silly. We all, I think anybody

01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:19.180
listening to this show on a cell phone connection probably knows that that's talk is silly, but

01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:23.500
people, people spread it. People spread things and Facebook is one thing they used to do it,

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:30.460
but I guess we get Facebook to spread the rumors that like loop boxes cause COVID-19.

01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:34.700
I don't know. At least that's a positive, you know, like we can get rid of loot boxes at the

01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:39.500
same time. We need those clickbait articles. I don't know, but, uh, maybe Facebook doesn't

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:44.300
want to be known as the capital of misinformation anymore. And they want to be known as a gaming

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:50.060
site. So Facebook is going to be releasing their own gaming mobile app this week. Supposedly it

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:55.740
launches on April 20th. Uh, so meaning Monday tomorrow. So we'll see. Uh, I don't know if it

01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:59.980
will, but that's the date they're targeting. I can't wait for all of the apps to shove that

01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:04.620
down my throat. Yeah. Right. Uh, there will be, uh, some casual games built into the app

01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:09.980
that you can play, but you can also watch and create gaming live streams because Facebook

01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:15.020
is trying to go after that audience with the Twitch and the YouTube and all that. They are

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:20.300
saying that the apple initially be available for Android. They are simply waiting on the iOS, uh,

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:26.860
apple approval type of a situation for, uh, that side of things. Maybe, maybe they won't. I don't

01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:32.220
know. I think it will go through, but anyway, uh, doesn't talk about how broadcasting is going to

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:38.540
work on the apple devices. Um, that could be interesting, but I think stream labs works,

01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:46.140
so I'm sure it's possible, but we'll see. Um, honestly, I'm not ready to really sign on to

01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:51.340
Facebook gaming. I think before Facebook tries to, this is a personal opinion. I think before

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:56.140
Facebook tries to put its hand in all these other cookie jars, they need to fix the jar they're in

01:04:56.140 --> 01:05:00.780
and the spreading of misinformation is that jar that needs to be fixed. Sure. I think I heard

01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:06.140
they made it so that if you like an article that has misinformation about COVID-19, a pop-up comes

01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:14.220
up. Um, that's a start, a really small delayed late after the fact start, but here, you know,

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:21.980
have a, have a cookie, you know, you did that now do more. Um, so we'll see, but in the meantime,

01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:26.380
I'm not interested in their gaming app whatsoever. Um, but maybe some of you are and you know what,

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:30.220
who knows, maybe it really will be the next big thing and I'm completely underestimating it,

01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:36.380
but I am a-okay with Twitch in the meantime. And Mixer's pretty cool too. Uh, and, uh, yeah,

01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:40.620
I'll leave it at that. So if we don't have any other comments on that, let's go over to, um,

01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:45.100
Dark Soccer with a bit of, um, kind of sad news. Bummers. Yeah. Lots of bummers. Sorry. Lots of

01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:52.380
bummers, but. So we have, uh, lost some people in the gaming industry and I, I'm always like,

01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:57.420
I read these articles. So-and-so has died. I'm like, that's very passive. They just died.

01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:02.380
So-and-so died. Just say it, you know, I hate the, the passive, make it gentle thing. I want it

01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:09.580
final, you know? But anyway, um, uh, among those lost was Rick May, who was the, uh, one of the

01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:17.820
voice actors in Star Fox 64. He was Peppy, Peppy Hare and Andross, you know, bad guy. Um, he also

01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:24.140
was, uh, the soldier in Team Fortress 2 and the narrator and voice of Genghis Khan in, uh, Age

01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:33.340
of Empires 2. He's done movie work. He was a teacher. Um, so, uh, you know, the community has

01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:39.340
suffered a, a loss, uh, with the hold that he's left. Um, another, you know, big name, um, a lot

01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:46.060
that we know, um, it was Paul Haddad who was the, uh, voice of Leon in the original release of

01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:52.940
Resident Evil 2 or Biohazard. Um, you know, and again, he had done, uh, some other movie work.

01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:58.860
Um, he's done some animated work in the 1990s. X-Men, he was Quicksilver. So, um, he was also

01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:04.060
like the Adventures of Tintin and Babar, you know, a lot, you know, classic video game,

01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:08.780
video game and, uh, animation voice actor. And again, another, another hole is left.

01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:16.220
And then our last one was the, uh, voice actor for, um, uh, Axel in, uh, Kingdom Hearts. It was,

01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:23.340
uh, Fujiwara Keiji, um, also, also died. Um, 55 years old, too. Um, he died of cancer.

01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:30.460
Um, and he had taken a break from voice acting in, um, from August, 2016 to June,

01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:36.700
2017 to go through treatment. Um, but, uh, you know, one of his other big roles, um,

01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:43.580
he was the father, um, in Crayon Shin-chan, uh, Hiroshi. And he, um, was also Arden in

01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:50.540
Final Fantasy 15 and Reno in Final Fantasy 7 Remake. So very recent loss, very recent voice

01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:55.660
actor. So there you go. And it is, it is interesting that the first question everybody's

01:07:55.660 --> 01:08:01.260
asking in this day and age is, was it COVID? Um, and in this case, um, I believe Rick May

01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:05.980
passed from COVID related complications, but, and they're, they're not St. Paul Haddad, the

01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:12.140
cause of death was not released. So, um, don't know on that one. Um, or do you? No. Um, I,

01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:15.740
I actually, I just closed it, but I thought that they had released it. Let me just double

01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:23.180
check it again. And then, uh, Keiji, uh, Fujiwara, uh, was cancer, as you said. Yeah. So, um,

01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:30.940
yeah, they did, they did release, um, what the cause of death was. Um, but, um, in other,

01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:35.100
you know, we've also, uh, for COVID things, now this has nothing to do with video games,

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:43.420
but everyone knows who Christopher Cross is, right? Like from the eighties, you know, um,

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:51.100
but he is paralyzed because of COVID. We've lost some amazing people. One of our, our, uh,

01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:58.220
or, uh, one of our, uh, big, uh, uh, names in trans right activism, uh, died as well. Very,

01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:04.300
uh, very recently only, I think a couple of weeks ago. So, um, that definitely is the first thing

01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:08.540
that we look at. Cause that seems to be the biggest killer in the United States is above

01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:13.420
every other country in the world combined. Um, Tiger Claw and Chad is mentioning the,

01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:19.100
uh, Danny Goldman passed this week. Uh, uh, not maybe known for games, but definitely known to

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:23.660
people for, uh, his role in young Frankenstein and was the voice of brainy Smurf. Uh, and then

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:29.420
I know we lost, uh, Brian Dennehy this week, who was very much a, that guy actor. Although

01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:34.300
again, Brian Dennehy was not COVID. It's just, you know, people die of other causes and that

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:40.380
is all happening. Go back and watch Cocoon. Yeah. Yeah. He was very much at that. I always

01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:44.540
think of, um, I know this is terrible, but I always think of the South Park movie cause

01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:49.340
they're singing the Brian Boy Tonto song. And at one point they have Brian Dennehy showing up and

01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:55.180
somebody goes, not fucking Brian Dennehy, Brian Boy Tonto. So, but he was definitely like, everybody

01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:58.300
still knows who Brian Dennehy is. Like he's one of those like people you look at and you just,

01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:04.300
yeah. Tiger claw mentioned, uh, first blood, you know, Rambo. So big girl. Yeah. Yeah. So,

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:09.900
um, very, very sad that, um, we're having all these losses, um, whether it be COVID or otherwise,

01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:15.820
I know, especially with those people going out to the beach or gathering in groups,

01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:21.660
protesting the thing that's keeping us safe. And my mom just told me that they lifted the work

01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:27.100
restrictions in Alabama. Oh, wow. She's going back to work full time. Well, full time for her.

01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:33.580
So yeah, I'm pissed and people are stupid, but it's, I'm trying not to get political,

01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:38.060
but America is broken. America is broken. There's going to be a very hard lesson learned and it's

01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:43.740
going to, it's going to be really, really unfortunate. So it's going to, the, the lesson

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:49.580
will be learned in blood and a story. All right. Well, let's move on to, um, something a little

01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:55.900
less serious. Hopefully low key. I don't know. We're talking about Nintendo switch updates,

01:10:55.900 --> 01:11:00.540
so, you know, that could be a pretty serious stuff. Yeah. It's some serious stuff. No,

01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:04.860
in this case, they're talking a little bit about, um, allowing you to actually be able to remap

01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:10.060
your buttons on your Nintendo switch. So that's kind of cool because it's not something that

01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:14.540
has been available. And I know that's something that was added to, like, I know the PlayStation,

01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:18.940
not to, well, it was probably a while ago, but it's still pretty nice that they have that feature

01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:24.060
available. So you can swap different things like A and B buttons, or, you know, change the

01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:30.140
orientation of the analog stick, um, you know, whatever, whatever you want to do,

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:36.380
uh, which is pretty cool. So, um, pretty neat that they have that available, that you could

01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:43.100
make those changes. So that was, um, that was pretty awesome. Uh, I have not planned on using

01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:47.340
this at all though, unfortunately, cause I haven't got to touch my switch in a long time.

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:54.860
It just hog that thing for Minecraft. Your switch needs some touch.

01:11:55.900 --> 01:12:03.740
Well, it's, it misses proper affection. Yeah. I mean, um, I, I probably won't use this feature,

01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:10.300
but I understand as far as accessibility reasons go, this is a very like easy fix for, um,

01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:15.420
consoles to make, to help more people be able to play games on said consoles. So, um, I'm all for

01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:20.380
it for that reason. You know, anything that opens up gaming or people is a good thing. So, um, yay

01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:25.100
to have those features in, even if it won't be something I use myself, maybe I'll use those new

01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:29.820
animal crossing pictures. They put it, cause I think now your little icon, uh, on animal or on

01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:35.500
the switch can be like six animal crossing characters, but yeah. Hmm. Do they have Ed?

01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:39.580
No, I don't think they have Ed, but they might have her SETI, but don't quote me on that. I'd

01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:45.660
have to, uh, I have to look. So, all right. Anyway. Um, all right. Well, let's move on and

01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:49.660
talk a little bit about, uh, a game that I think is getting a lot of attention over on Twitch and

01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:56.380
a lot of other places. And that is a game called Valorient, uh, which is a new Riot game, right?

01:12:56.380 --> 01:13:01.340
Of course, it's the makers of league of legends, which has been hugely popular on Twitch and other,

01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:06.460
um, you know, competition type things, e-sports websites and stuff. Um, so many people have been

01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:09.500
looking forward to, you know, what are some of the other things that Riot is going to develop

01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:14.140
and one of those games that Riot's been working on, there's been others, uh, is Valorient, which

01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:20.060
is, or is it Valorant? I thought there, is there an I in it or not? I'm not sure. Is it Valorant?

01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:25.420
Maybe. Um, maybe somebody in chat's going to yell at me that I'm pronouncing it wrong. Yeah. I,

01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:29.500
I don't know why, but I had an I inserted in it. Okay. So Valorants, excuse me. Sorry. I got it

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:34.300
wrong. Um, but, uh, for that game, I don't know. You have to apparently have a key to get in. So

01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:38.060
it's not something I'm even playing right now anyway. So how would I, how could I be expected

01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:44.300
to know the title? Uh, but Valorant, uh, is a new first person shooter game from, uh, Riot.

01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:48.940
And, uh, it's causing a little bit of controversy though, because there is an anti-cheat system

01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:53.020
that's being installed with the game. Now, not the anti-cheat systems are necessarily

01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:59.180
controversial by nature, but this one called Riot Vanguard is apparently pretty aggressive because

01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:03.260
it actually starts up when you start your computer up. It is not something that starts

01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:08.460
when the game starts, such as say Fortnite's anti-cheat system launches when you launch the

01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:12.780
game. But, you know, some folks, you know, that are kind of defending what Riot is doing with

01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:18.780
this are saying, Hey, a lot of the ways people get around the Fortnite anti-cheat is that they

01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:24.540
start those anti-cheats before they start, uh, Fortnite. So that way it kind of bypasses the

01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:29.900
anti-cheat system. This being a little deeper in your computer boot up sequence, um, is a little

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:35.100
harder to subvert in those ways. Um, but of course, you know, people that want to really

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:39.500
control the type of information that's going in and out of their computer, not everybody's super

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:44.700
into that. Uh, in fact, on Reddit, some people are saying you have a piece of software that can't be

01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:49.260
turned off. It runs with elevated privileges nonstop on your system. Let's say the anti-cheat

01:14:49.260 --> 01:14:53.980
gets compromised tomorrow. You won't know that your computer is exposed and it won't update

01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:59.980
until you start the game. Now, uh, one of the, uh, leads on the anti-cheat Paul Chamberlain

01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:07.900
responded on subreddit to some of these, uh, uh, issues, um, saying, um, that basically, uh,

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:12.540
Vanguard is functioning the way it's supposed to. The anti-cheat driver itself is only one

01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:17.340
small component of Vanguard. We've also built a new backend that allows us to be more specific

01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:21.980
with our anti-cheat checks. Instead of running the same security stigands on all the computers,

01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:25.660
we can run checks and response to player reports or other suspicious behavior,

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:29.660
which allow us to reduce the frequency and intensity of scans on the majority of players

01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:35.740
computers. And it kind of, it kind of ends in this whole, like, you just have to trust us type of

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:42.460
thing. Um, we invite players who are unsure to observe our actions and call us out. If they don't

01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:47.180
like what they see, we think most players will appreciate our efforts, but if they don't, then

01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:55.580
we'll change tactics and find another way to meet our players' expectations. Hmm. So, um, and Quest

01:15:55.580 --> 01:16:00.700
Buster, uh, giving the secret on how to get into this game saying you have a chance to get a beta

01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:05.900
key drop by watching a Valorant stream with a Twitch account linked to Riot. It's one reason

01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:11.020
why Valorant streamers have titles emphasizing drops enabled. So people want you to come look

01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:16.300
at their stream so that you have a chance to get into the game for yourself. So, um, but obviously

01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:20.060
this anti-cheat thing being on all the time, it's something some folks may want to consider.

01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:25.980
Something to go with that though, and I think this is important to say as well, um, Riot is offering

01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:33.980
up to $100,000 if you can find a security flaw in Vanguard. Uh, it is a contest, I guess you could

01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:39.100
say, being hosted at HackerOne. And, uh, that is a site where there's all sorts of tech companies

01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:44.380
offering bounties for finding issues with their, um, uh, software and so forth. Um,

01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:50.540
this starts at $25,000 for a bug that allows outside entities to access a user's private

01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:57.100
information all the way to $100,000 for code execution at the kernel level. Basically meaning

01:16:57.100 --> 01:17:04.780
that somebody kind of like, I guess like an alien in the movie kind of face hugs on to this software

01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:08.620
to do very bad things to your computer because it's something that boots up when your computer

01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:14.860
boots up. So, um, I suppose that's one way to, uh, make a point about this software and make

01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:20.460
some money off of it if you want. So, let's see, um, TigerKlonchat says, I wonder if it's

01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:23.820
something you can go into the task manager and disable in the startup. I don't know,

01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:27.740
because I haven't used it myself, but Bobby does make a good point. If it was, people wouldn't be

01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:32.220
complaining. So yeah, I think, I think if it was easy enough to kill it like that, people probably

01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:36.060
wouldn't be complaining. Um, so, you know, something to think about when you're going to

01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:39.020
install the game, this isn't going to stop everybody from installing the game, you know,

01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:45.660
and, and riot to give them some credit. They are saying, if you think there's a problem with it,

01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:49.820
call us out, watch it, see what it does for yourself. And if you think it's doing anything,

01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:54.540
it shouldn't be call us on it. So it is interesting. They're kind of taking that stance

01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:58.300
where it's like, no, really, we're not taking any personal information. We're not doing anything

01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:03.980
like watch, you know, so it's, I'm less interested in what it's potentially going to do to my system

01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:08.940
in one more interest in if it's actually going to still work, because it seems like whenever

01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:14.620
these anti-cheat things are put in place, it just prompts people to try to find something that's

01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:19.420
subverted. So I guess we'll have to wait and see. So it'd be interesting. It'll be interesting to

01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:24.780
see if somebody wants to do it for the $100,000 bounty or wants to do it just so they can do it.

01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:29.580
We'll see what happens. The internet's an interesting place sometimes.

01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:31.660
Why can't we have both?

01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:36.620
And we probably will. But in the meantime, we'll go to our next story, Darsakra.

01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:43.100
Well, how about something happy, something positive? Well, I mean, it's not really happy.

01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:49.260
But it's, I guess, positive. Because remember, positive things aren't always happy things.

01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:58.380
So there is a gamer who played Final Fantasy XIV. Rob, this is relevant to your interests,

01:18:58.380 --> 01:18:59.420
I'm sure. Yes, of course.

01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:08.940
But in-game, he was known as Fern LeRoy, L-E apostrophe R-O-Y. And he was very, very popular,

01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:15.900
well-liked by his free company and lots of people. And he died of the novel coronavirus.

01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:23.180
And it went out on Reddit about it. They started talking about it. And they had a funeral

01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:30.540
procession. So on his server, which is the Zalera server, they started off in Uldah,

01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:37.740
in the desert. And they were joined by characters from another server, Core, where his alt was on,

01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:46.860
named Poppy Rose. And the whole group wore black. They had black parasols. They wore very funeral

01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:53.580
appropriate clothing. And they walked all the way through the central shroud and ended up at

01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:59.980
the Guardian Tree. I mean, sacred site in the game. It took 30 minutes of in-game time to make

01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:06.060
the walk. Because they were walking and not running. Many people run by default, but these

01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:13.980
folks walked. Yeah, it was a very slow procession. As I recall, there's videos of it. There were live

01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:24.540
tweets of it, all of that. And they finally ended with some words and, I guess, a virtual funeral.

01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:34.220
So as it went, they all went on to Twitter, talked about what the people did. And one of the quotes

01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:39.340
on there is, the Final Fantasy XIV community never ceases to amaze me. Such a huge turnout and show

01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:44.540
respect to community and camaraderie at this memorial service. My view distance couldn't

01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:50.620
handle so many people. May the fallen player rest in peace. My condolences to all involved. Be safe,

01:20:50.620 --> 01:20:57.340
everyone. And I mean, basically, another person said that it took up two to three zones of the

01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:03.980
base game. So pretty big. And so many people offering their condolences. It was just really,

01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:12.060
really beautiful. And not the first time we've seen other players honor somebody in a game.

01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:19.740
For sure. But this is a very big one to do it in a big MMO and cross server. So, hey.

01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:25.020
Well, and I think also, yes, you're right. We've heard of this type of memorial before. It's not

01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:29.820
the first time it's even happened in Final Fantasy XIV. And I'm sure many people have seen this sort

01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:39.260
of similar memorial in EverQuest or World of Warcraft or insert many other major MMOs here.

01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:45.260
But I also think the reason why this is kind of newsworthy all over again, and why this particular

01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:51.500
story is getting the credit it is, is because for many people, you can't really memorialize in

01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:56.380
person right now. That's what makes everything that's going on almost even more tragic is that

01:21:56.380 --> 01:22:02.620
those that pass really can't be properly, and I'm using my quoting fingers, memorialized because

01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:08.940
people can't gather in one place. So this is one way that people are getting around that of sorts

01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:13.900
by doing a virtual type of memorial. And I almost wonder if this isn't the type of thing you might

01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:21.420
see more of in these. I mean, not that I would wish that, but I think it might just be one of

01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:30.380
those, because of that issue we have, you might see this happen more often. And even in things

01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:36.700
like Animal Crossing, not even things like funerals, but like weddings, drag shows, I mean,

01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:42.380
you name it, things that people gather to do in person, they're doing an Animal Crossing, and MMOs

01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:48.860
and stuff, I'm sure. So it's an interesting sign of the times, even if this isn't the first time

01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:53.500
we've heard a story like that. There was one instance in Animal Crossing where the person made

01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:58.780
an 18 tile image of her mother who had just died and they couldn't hold a funeral.

01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:09.180
That's really sad. Yeah. And so she spent time taking an actual photo, bringing it into the

01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:15.340
pattern maker and trying to get it all just right to have a picture, a memorial to her mother. And

01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:22.300
it was like, it took her two weeks to do it and then have a funeral in game.

01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:29.900
And not to go on the sad point of this, but unhappy things, like I said, I was using this

01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:37.100
for my birthday, to have a little birthday party today. So people are also using the games for

01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:42.140
happier occasions. For sure. Not everything is a Zoom meeting, although certainly that's getting

01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:48.060
used a lot too. So, all right. Well, let's move on. Just a couple more stories before we get to

01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:54.380
the classic game of the week. Loki. Let's talk about more things that are closed. So unfortunately,

01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:59.260
with E3 and everything being canceled, we were kind of hoping that maybe Gamescom might be the

01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:05.340
answer to getting some of our gaming news. Fortunately, because of a ruling in Germany

01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:10.940
that has basically banned any large gatherings until the end of August, Gamescom is also going

01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:17.820
to be canceled. So what's good though is they are refunding all the tickets that were already

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:23.100
ordered, but unfortunately they're not going to have a live event. Now they're planning on maybe

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:28.780
doing a digital event. So they're working on that, but there's not really any details on that just

01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:37.660
yet. So hopefully we'll have something digital from them coming around the same time. That,

01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:45.180
as well as we also news that San Diego Comic-Con has also been canceled. San Diego Comic-Con,

01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:50.940
of course, mostly a comic convention as well as like moving properties like that,

01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:56.540
but they do have some gaming announcements and gaming stuff sometimes coming out of that as well.

01:24:56.540 --> 01:25:02.460
So unfortunately this year they're not going to be doing that either. Yeah. I think like when

01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:07.900
Marvel versus Capcom 3 or Infinite or whatever it was called was coming out, like they announced

01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:13.820
a lot of stuff at Comic-Con. So sometimes you get some kind of gaming tangents, we'll say.

01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:17.980
Yeah. So that's unfortunate that they're not going to be doing that, but they did announce

01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:24.300
that they'll be returning next year, July 22nd through the 25th. So that's unfortunate,

01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:27.900
lots of stuff that we're looking forward to. Hopefully we'll get those announcements anyways.

01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:31.340
And besides, you know, I can't go to Comic-Con, so I got to wait for all those trailers to hit

01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:36.860
online anyways. So whatever. Yeah. I mean, it honestly, at this point just seems like if it's

01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:42.940
a convention in 2020, it's probably not going to happen. So, you know, and that obviously makes me

01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:48.700
sad and I still I'm crossing my fingers and my toes that maybe a miracle happens. Maybe anything

01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:53.900
is possible after all, especially the whole world working on it, but I'm slowly accepting that

01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:58.700
reality as sad as it is. So it'll just make that next year. And once we get on the other side of

01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:06.380
this, it'll make it all that much sweeter, I suppose. So, all right. Well, maybe some good

01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:13.020
news about what's going on with the ESRB is that finally, after all this time, and it feels like

01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:18.860
really one of those things where it's like, finally, they did this. The ESRB is now adding

01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:24.460
to their ratings if a game has loot boxes, except they're not calling it that, they're calling it

01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:30.060
in-game purchases. So if the game has microtransactions, it will have a little

01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:33.340
addition to the label underneath. It doesn't affect the letter rating and that can still be,

01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:37.740
you know, E for everyone or, you know, excuse me, the typical ratings that the video games use.

01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:43.260
But, you know, it always says why, like, why did this game get an M? It's not just in-game

01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:46.540
purchases because that's been a thing that's already been happening, but now they're including

01:26:46.540 --> 01:26:50.380
if it includes random items. I'm sorry. Yes, thank you. I would have gotten there eventually. Yes,

01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:55.500
it includes random items is the other key word there with the in-game purchases. And that means,

01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:59.900
because they're not saying loot boxes, because I guess that's not really a term they expect

01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:03.900
everybody to know. They did explain it on their website why they didn't use loot boxes, but,

01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:08.940
you know, whatever. They're still kind of making it clear that that is the reason why they're

01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:13.420
putting it on the rating. And so it will be assigned to all games that include purchases

01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:19.820
with any randomized elements, including loot boxes, gotcha games, item or card packs. So

01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:25.820
that would affect things like Magic the Gathering online and stuff too. Prize wheel or what's

01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:33.100
blizzards? Hearthstone, things like that. Prize wheels, treasure chests, and more. Games that have

01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:38.540
the in-game purchases includes random items. Notice may also include other non-randomized

01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:43.100
paid elements. And I'm thinking that might be something like Overwatch that, you know,

01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:48.700
it kind of has a little bit of both. So not, well, not very often, but I have seen them sell skins

01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:55.260
for charity. So that would count. So anyway, there it is. That is what they're doing.

01:27:56.380 --> 01:28:02.700
What do you guys think? It's about time, right? It's one of those things where it's like, oh,

01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:07.100
now that it's happened, there's so much other crap going on in the world. It's like, oh,

01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:14.860
you finally caught up. Great. Have a cookie. It's not hardly even catching up. It's just like,

01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:18.940
they're just kind of checking off that box. Like, see, we're doing something. We care.

01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:23.260
But really they don't. I mean, I just, I don't think anybody,

01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:29.660
they're never going to do anything because unfortunately the ESA, well, this isn't

01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:38.060
necessarily ESA, but I don't know. A lot of lobbying done by the ESA because for these

01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:42.300
publishers, this is a very big revenue source for them. So of course they're not going to want to

01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:46.620
get rid of this stuff. And so they're just basically saying, you know, kind of checking

01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:51.980
the boxes so that when this controversy comes up, oh, it's gambling. But we tell you that it's in

01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:56.060
the game. We have the ratings. It shows it on here. See, we're not trying to trick you,

01:28:56.620 --> 01:29:02.060
you know, that type of stuff. So it'll be interesting to see that also includes like,

01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:08.780
you know, some of these games that add it after the fact, because I know that a lot of times the

01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:16.060
boxes will be printed with these certain ratings. And then like, for example, the crash team racing

01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:21.100
stuff had loot boxes added after the game came out and after it's been reviewed. And I'm thinking

01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:24.700
that a lot of times when these ratings are updated, they don't necessarily update them

01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:30.300
to the printed box copies, but they will update the ratings on the ESRB website. Like anybody

01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:40.060
even goes there to look at anything. So I don't know. I just, good job. At least you tried.

01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:48.540
All right. ESRB, this claps for you. Here we go. One clap instead of a round of applause. You get one

01:29:48.540 --> 01:29:53.180
clap. All right. Let's move on. Let's move on to simpler times when there was no, there were no

01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:58.380
random items purchasable for money. You got what you got with your cartridge and you were happy

01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:01.900
with it. It's a classic game of the week. Dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault

01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:08.620
and find a game that she thinks, Hey, Hey, you play this, not that, uh, dark Sakura,

01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:15.180
what is your pick for the classic game of the week? I picked F zero, which is another thing

01:30:15.180 --> 01:30:20.140
I'm surprised I've never picked before. Me too. This is, this is one of my big classics. I love

01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:26.700
this game. Yeah. I love me some F zero and I might've sat and jammed out to the mute city,

01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:30.460
you know, uh, level, cause honestly it's my favorite music in the game.

01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:38.860
Um, so yeah, um, F zero is, uh, one of those, uh, early racing game. Well, not really early

01:30:38.860 --> 01:30:45.180
for the super Nintendo, but it was, uh, I'd say one of those notable games. It was the first,

01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:50.620
of course of the F zero series. It was a launch title for the SNES. So yes, it was early for,

01:30:51.020 --> 01:30:57.420
for the super Nintendo. Um, it has been emulated on a virtual console services. Um,

01:30:57.420 --> 01:31:02.940
and I'll, I'll get into, of course, other releases of it, but the game is taking place in 2560

01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:12.060
where, um, you, uh, race formula one races, uh, called F zero. Um, and basically it's just bored

01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:17.580
rich people who made up these kinds of races. And so you have, uh, you know, all of your,

01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:22.540
you know, various characters who race and you've got, you know, power ups here and there are very

01:31:22.540 --> 01:31:31.340
futuristic, really good music, some floating areas. Um, um, but the races and F zero, uh,

01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:37.180
are five laps around a track. You have to complete each lap in a successfully higher place so that

01:31:37.180 --> 01:31:43.100
you're not disqualified as you're going through. So, um, you are also given a four second speed

01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:49.260
boost when you pass, um, a lap called the super jet and you get points determined by what place

01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:57.340
you're on. Um, and you can even, uh, get an extra machine so that you can, uh, retry the course.

01:31:57.340 --> 01:32:02.060
Um, if you, if you've got a certain points and you haven't made it through. So, um, you've got

01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:06.780
two different methods of boosting your speed. You have these plates that will launch you into the

01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:16.860
air with, um, extra acceleration. Um, and then, um, you, uh, also have, uh, uh, just the, the

01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:22.300
general, uh, dash zones that, uh, increase your speed on the ground. Um, you have two modes of

01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:26.700
play of grand prix mode where you choose a league and you race against other vehicles in there,

01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:32.220
and then practice mode where you just basically play, play along, play along. Um, your, your

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:37.900
15 tracks divided into three leagues. So you have a knight queen and king. Those are the difficulty

01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:43.100
levels. Um, and each league has up to four selectable levels in there. You have beginner

01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:49.180
standard expert master. Um, you've got multiple courses for death, wind, port town and red canyon.

01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:55.980
Um, they have a pathway that's not accessible, um, until you're on another iteration of that,

01:32:55.980 --> 01:33:00.140
of that track. And then it closes the previous pack. So it kind of moves things around here.

01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:07.420
Um, as far as, um, the development in this game, it, um, in Japan, it was a launch title,

01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:13.020
November 1st, 1990. Um, it came out in the U S August, 1991 in Europe, uh, sometime in 1992.

01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:16.940
And in the Japanese market, it was only that in super Mario world that came out.

01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:23.260
Um, in North America, of course, we had zero pilot wings, uh, SimCity, Gradius three, and,

01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:31.180
uh, and super Mario world. But, um, the game was produced by Miyamoto. Um, uh, artwork was done by,

01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:40.220
uh, Shimizu Kazunobu. Um, one of the, uh, art designers, um, was, uh, basically, uh, and his

01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:45.660
name, sorry, Imamura Takaya, um, got some pretty free reign for doing some of the design for the

01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:51.500
characters and the courses. Um, so they really kind of went all out. And one of the good things

01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:55.900
about this game is that this is really, I think one of the games that gave us a clear introduction

01:33:55.900 --> 01:34:04.700
to mode seven. Um, yeah, that's like the cute. Yeah, go ahead. So mode seven for, for, for y'all

01:34:04.700 --> 01:34:12.460
kids, you don't know what the mode seven is. Um, it is a way of raster scaling. So basically,

01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:17.340
I'm sure you've heard the word vector. I'm sure you've heard raster, um, vector uses mathematical

01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:22.940
calculations. So that's why, say in a vector designed game or vector art, no matter how much

01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:27.420
you resize it, it stays the same because it's all mathematically recalculating itself. Raster

01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:32.940
is going to be basically pixel. So yeah, you did get like zoomed in pixels on everything. I mean,

01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:41.500
think of, uh, uh, what am I trying to think of that had a really bad zoom in? Um, but at any rate,

01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:48.940
you, you had, you know, but it would move and scale and it gave you this, uh, pseudo 3d. Um,

01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:56.060
and, uh, it really was mind blowing at the time. I mean, we had racing games before,

01:34:56.060 --> 01:35:00.300
but this was the big one. Yeah. Like, you know, and again, I know, uh, we have, you know, a lot

01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:05.420
of folks in their twenties and low thirties who may not have really been around or were very,

01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:09.660
very, very young when this game first came out. But like, you know, many of us that are hosting

01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:14.380
the show were like, you know, like 12 and 13 and so forth when this game first came out.

01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:20.540
And I got to tell you, it was mind blowing. Like it, like the 3d in this game, the fact it was

01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:26.700
like all in a cartridge and just like how it moved so fast. And I don't know if that was part

01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:30.860
of the intentional design of why they did the game the way that they did, but in a stage like

01:35:30.860 --> 01:35:36.780
mute city, it's going by so fast. It looks like it's a real city down there, even though if you,

01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:41.260
even though if you take a look, cause it really it's, it's just like a painted sprite. It's like

01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:45.900
something you could have done a Mario paint, really a 2d Mario paint that they do this mode

01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:50.940
seven effect on and then layer the, um, sprite of the car on top of it. It's, it's really brilliant.

01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:54.380
But when it goes that fast, it looks like a city. But when you look at it kind of standing still,

01:35:54.380 --> 01:36:01.260
you can see it's kind of garbage, but it doesn't matter. That's something that, that designers do.

01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:04.700
I mean, like for example, if you have a billboard, you know, your print in a book,

01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:10.700
resolution should be 300 DPI, 300 dots per inch. When you're doing, say something on a billboard,

01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:14.540
it's going to be half that, you know, it's going to be higher than web quality, for example. But

01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:18.940
when you're looking at it from that distance, moving that fast, it doesn't need to be 300 DPI.

01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:24.460
And that's what they're going with. It's, it's an illusion. It's a, uh, chunk dull, you know,

01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:28.300
the, the trick, the eye. Yeah. And it's, and I don't know if you were going to bring it up,

01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:33.740
so I'm sorry if I'm talking ahead of you, but, um, you know, Mario Kart obviously was a huge,

01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:38.460
you know, in some ways successor to this, but Mario Kart essentially uses all the same tricks

01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:45.740
of F-Zero. It's all the same tricks. The only, in many ways, Super Mario Kart is F-Zero too.

01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:51.180
And I know that sounds a little weird, but without F-Zero, you would not have Mario Kart.

01:36:51.180 --> 01:36:56.860
It's really, it's really that simple. No, I, I get that. I absolutely get that.

01:36:57.660 --> 01:37:00.380
Um, and you know, there is really

01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:10.540
so much, you know, that people, I think, take for granted about, um, about this game and what it

01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:15.500
really is offered, you know, and we've had many other ones, which I'll be touching on, uh, later

01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:20.460
and, you know, they've been certainly popular and well talked about on this show. So, um, you know,

01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:27.980
looking at this, it really is, I think what modernized the racing game for the home console.

01:37:28.780 --> 01:37:35.900
Make sense? Yes. And a few other things with that mode seven is that it also allowed for

01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:40.300
different texture mapping, you know, and I'm not going to get in way too much into a little bit

01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:43.740
more of that. We talked about what it does in practice as opposed to what it does on the back

01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:49.020
end. So I'm going to get into a little bit more of the periphery about it and how it was received

01:37:49.020 --> 01:37:55.420
when we had come on since then. So did you know there was an F-Zero jazz album? I did. Somebody

01:37:55.420 --> 01:38:01.820
got me a copy of that way back in the day. I did. The songs translate well to jazz. In fact, um,

01:38:01.820 --> 01:38:07.580
in Mario Kart 8, because they bring back, I think those like, they're kind of jazzy covers. They're

01:38:07.580 --> 01:38:12.700
not the same jazzy covers, but they're, they're also jazz inspired, uh, versions of the tracks in

01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:19.260
Mario Kart when they do the F-Zero levels. Well, and the other one of the other things too, is that,

01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:26.940
um, the, uh, great. I lost my train of thought. Um, the album actually did bring in some, some

01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:32.300
notable musicians. I mean, basically maybe, maybe if you weren't super big into jazz might not know

01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:37.980
them, but we had, uh, uh, uh, for playing on saxophone, Mark Russo of the yellow jackets,

01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:44.460
Robin Ford on electric guitar, um, you had for your, uh, 12 tracks on, uh, from the game were

01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:51.180
composed by, uh, Kanki Umiko and Ishida Naoto with arrangements by Robert Hill and Michiko Hill.

01:38:51.180 --> 01:38:55.820
Um, so it actually, I think it's a really good album. It's a kind of a, kind of a chill fun thing

01:38:55.820 --> 01:39:02.540
to listen to, you know. Um, but the game itself was very well received. Um, and basically they,

01:39:02.540 --> 01:39:09.420
they thought it was some of the most fluid pseudo 3d of its time. Um, it got, I mean, just, you know,

01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:17.180
I'll put it this way, Famitsu gave it a 37 out of 40. That's pretty good for Famitsu. Yeah. Yeah.

01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:23.020
IGN gave it a 7.5 out of 10, which I don't know why, because it was better than that. Um, it had

01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:30.620
variety of tracks. Um, it had really, uh, I'm trying to think of a good way. Well, actually,

01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:36.620
GameSpy, uh, one of the writers said that it was a finesse racer. Um, it took practice and

01:39:36.620 --> 01:39:44.060
memorization and a fine, uh, sense of control. So I think that it really did bring more excitement to

01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:50.700
a genre that maybe had started to fall a little bit. Um, and as far as, uh, its, uh, legacy,

01:39:50.700 --> 01:39:55.900
it did invent that futuristic racing genre. Would we have had Wipeout without that? Um, would we

01:39:55.900 --> 01:40:02.940
have had, um, any of these other kind of high-tech future racing games? Um, Daytona, um, USA even was

01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:11.900
inspired by F-Zero. Um, and, uh, in fact, even, uh, the president of, uh, amusement's vision,

01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:19.980
uh, Nagoshi Toshihiro stated that, um, F-Zero taught him what a game should be and influenced

01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:26.220
him to create Daytona USA. So, and then it's also amusement vision that did work with Nintendo,

01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:33.260
um, to create F-Zero GX and AX. And Nagoshi was one of the, uh, co-producers of the game. So,

01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:39.260
like I said, there were sequels. Um, of course, they had developed a sequel of F-Zero on this

01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:46.460
nest. Um, but, uh, it was supposed to be for the Satellaview, um, subscription, uh, using that add

01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:53.660
on. Um, and in fact, you could get F-Zero from one of the download kiosks, um, in Japan. It was,

01:40:53.660 --> 01:41:03.420
oh crap, what was it called? Um, the, uh, I know what it was called. It was, um, I'm forgetting

01:41:03.420 --> 01:41:08.780
what it was called. It was like a download kiosk that gave you, um, one of, you know, it kind of

01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:12.460
was like how the, um, the Famicom disc works. Yeah, I was gonna say, I've read about those,

01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:16.220
especially for the Famicom disc system. Nintendo Power. It was called the Nintendo Power. Oh,

01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:19.820
how funny. Maybe that's where the magazine got its name, but yeah, we didn't have anything like

01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:24.060
that in the US, obviously. That was very much a Japanese only type of thing, but that's, you know,

01:41:24.060 --> 01:41:28.380
a big reason why Famicom had a disc system. Yeah. Yeah. And the Satellaview too, obviously,

01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:35.180
would never hear either. Um, but at any rate, um, you, uh, if you had the, uh, Saint Giga

01:41:35.180 --> 01:41:40.380
subscription for Satellaview, um, on the Super Famicom, you could, you could get that kind of

01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:45.020
add on version and then you could download those titles and save it on the flash ROM cartridge.

01:41:45.020 --> 01:41:48.860
Um, the sequel was released as the name of BS F-Zero Grand Prix, cause you know,

01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:54.220
they're all the BS Satellaview and BS F-Zero Grand Prix too. Um, you can get lots of them

01:41:54.220 --> 01:42:01.980
to say it now in the words, but, um, the F-Zero, uh, Grand Prix had a new track along with the

01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:07.740
original 15 and four different playable vehicles. And according to Nintendo Power, um, they wanted

01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:14.700
to bring it to North America via a game pack. Um, but it didn't. Um, so as far as other ones we had

01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:22.220
on the Nintendo 64 F-Zero X, where, um, they continued to, um, you know, to, to try to push

01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:27.340
what that system could do. Um, and there was a lot of pushing to be done. Let me tell you, um,

01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:32.220
they also brought the mode seven graphic effects into the Game Boy advanced version for

01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:41.020
maximum velocity and GP legend, um, which, uh, the former was released in 2001. Um,

01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:47.580
and it was considered to be a hard over overhaul of F-Zero. Um, there was also F-Zero GX and AX,

01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:53.740
which were, um, uh, uh, respectively released for the Nintendo GameCube and Triforce arcade

01:42:53.740 --> 01:43:00.940
system boards in 2003. And it was the first, uh, big video game collaboration between Nintendo and

01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:06.620
Sega. And I really, we, we, we here at orange on radio cannot understate how good those games were

01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:13.420
and how fabulous that whole like arcade connection was. It was just, it was amazing. Unmatched since

01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:22.060
then. And GX was the first of zero game that had a story mode. Um, AX was also, um, uh, called,

01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:27.180
uh, little GameStop said that, you know, GameStop GameSpot said they're the first to get a proper

01:43:27.180 --> 01:43:33.340
arcade release. So, um, and then of course the most recent one is F-Zero climax that came out

01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:39.340
for a Game Boy advanced in 2004 and the first, uh, F-Zero game to have a built-in, uh, track

01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:44.860
editor without needing an expansion or add-on. I was going to say, uh, GX actually has, well,

01:43:44.860 --> 01:43:51.420
it's hidden in the code, but actually has the AX like interface in tracks and everything in there.

01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:56.380
I know you can unlock some tracks when you link it with the arcade, but they actually had the

01:43:56.940 --> 01:44:03.660
AX mode in there that they never enabled. Yeah. I remember that. But at any rate, I mean,

01:44:03.660 --> 01:44:11.500
there we go. It's such a prime game and I'm sorry, I had never even done this on, uh, uh,

01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:16.460
for the classic game of the week because I really, really believe that we are due for a new F-Zero.

01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:23.500
We are over due for a new F-Zero. It's been 16 years, Nintendo. I'm just, I am sad that Mario

01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:27.980
Kart has just taken over Nintendo, which I, and don't get me wrong, I love Mario Kart. So it's

01:44:27.980 --> 01:44:33.180
not like I'm like really mad about it. I think, I think Mario Kart has just taken over Nintendo's

01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:36.700
racing thing because I think at the end of the day, Mario Kart sold better. You put Mario in it

01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:41.260
and it sells better. And you know, that's, that's on us for not supporting F-Zero. Well, I mean,

01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:46.700
you, me and Matt have always supported F-Zero, but, uh, you know, it's on the general gaming

01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:51.580
populace for not supporting it the same way that they support Mario. I wish they would do more DLC

01:44:51.580 --> 01:44:58.940
maybe 16 years. There's a good portion of the populace that wasn't alive. I know, I know,

01:44:58.940 --> 01:45:03.580
I know. No, you're right. You're right. But, um, yeah, it is funny because some folks in

01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:07.580
chatter, like I swear you've done F-Zero this game of the week before, but like, I know,

01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:11.340
I think that's just because I looked on the Wiki. No, I don't think I know, but it's, it's one of

01:45:11.340 --> 01:45:16.140
those. I think it's because we talk so much about, and maybe we've done F-Zero AX and GX. We probably

01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:20.620
did those games in some way, but, um, maybe it's because we talk so much about how much we love

01:45:20.620 --> 01:45:25.500
F-Zero and that these games need to come back that it seems like we've done it as a classic

01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:31.740
game of the week. So anyway, um, orange right says, isn't F-Zero on the super Nintendo switch

01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:36.620
online? Yes, it is. And it's on the classic, uh, super Nintendo mini. So, uh, many ways to still

01:45:36.620 --> 01:45:42.300
officially revisit this game legally without having to download a ROM. So, um, yeah, get on it,

01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:46.860
kids check out, uh, F-Zero and, uh, think about how you wouldn't have Mario Kart without it.

01:45:47.660 --> 01:45:51.500
So we talked a lot, we let the video loop twice on that. We talked about that. What are you doing

01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:56.860
with your life? Seriously? Get with game. Uh, honestly though, like, even if you can't like

01:45:56.860 --> 01:46:01.100
super get into the original, because the original does feel a little plain now, uh, you know,

01:46:01.100 --> 01:46:05.900
cause like there's only like one type of car you're ever passing us over, like try somehow

01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:10.460
to play F-Zero GX. And I really wish Nintendo would bring that back somehow, even if they just

01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:15.180
bring back F-Zero GX, like I would so support that coming out on, on switch.

01:46:15.980 --> 01:46:20.780
I also want to point out to Bobby who says, you know what they need to do. They need to

01:46:20.780 --> 01:46:23.900
make a spinoff game. That's based on the smash brothers character, captain Falcon

01:46:24.940 --> 01:46:34.460
whale. There was an anime called F-Zero GP legend that, um, talked, uh, had quite a bit of, um,

01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:38.300
of captain Falcon in it. He is actually one of the main protagonists in it. Um,

01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:47.420
uh, he is, uh, named Bart otherwise, but yeah, it's, uh, basically, uh, had this whole plot

01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:51.580
around, uh, captain Falcon. And yeah, he was the main protagonist in the GX story mode.

01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:57.100
All right. Well, let's, uh, yeah. And the other interesting thing about GX is that they had

01:46:57.100 --> 01:47:02.220
a record. I was saying something about it because not everyone knows that they have like,

01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:07.340
like something like 32 characters in F-Zero GX. So there's a ton of characters,

01:47:07.340 --> 01:47:12.540
every single one of them has a theme song. And like, unless you go into the character

01:47:12.540 --> 01:47:17.020
information screen, you'll never hear it. It's so interesting to me how like, there's so many

01:47:17.020 --> 01:47:23.100
characters and so many theme songs and you probably missed them in F-Zero. It's just

01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:31.500
interesting. So audio blink. Yeah, for sure. And I was going to say, and if for those fans of DDR,

01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:37.260
a couple of the characters had clips, uh, from, um, it's not, well, it's not clips,

01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:46.140
but it, it, it samples the same samples as legend of max. Really? Yes. I, I, I back in the day when

01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:53.740
I did these, like some, I did a lot of the Loki remix things. Those are good. Some of the lamer

01:47:53.740 --> 01:48:00.460
low key remixes were like, uh, with one of those songs and yeah, it has, has the fly and stuff

01:48:00.460 --> 01:48:03.900
like that in there. I wonder if I need to play those on Twitch some night. I wonder if I could

01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:07.580
get away with playing those on Twitch. It would depend which ones, probably the, the ones rooted

01:48:07.580 --> 01:48:11.740
in Bamani are probably fine, but maybe some of your, like the ones from the matrix soundtrack,

01:48:11.740 --> 01:48:15.500
I probably couldn't do those, but, uh, yeah, we'll have to play some of those some night.

01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:19.420
All right. Anyway. Uh, thank you. It was a good classic of the week. Really good. Um,

01:48:19.420 --> 01:48:23.820
well, I mean, they're all good, but that one was particularly good. Extra good. Extra good. All

01:48:23.820 --> 01:48:28.860
right. Uh, anyway, let's move on. Uh, rapid fire news. Uh, we got still a lot of news to cover.

01:48:28.860 --> 01:48:35.580
Let's get to it. Loki. All right. So let's talk a little bit about, uh, Terraria. So that's a game

01:48:35.580 --> 01:48:40.940
that we haven't brought up in a long time, but Hey, they're doing their final update on May 16th

01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:49.420
on PC. So the game's been out since 2011 and their final update called a title or is it journeys end

01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:54.780
is going to be coming out on all of the, I at least on PC at first. And then I assume

01:48:54.780 --> 01:48:59.340
the other platforms as well. Uh, it's going to add a bunch of new items, characters, and

01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:03.980
mini biomes. So look forward to that. I think that's something that's in my library that

01:49:03.980 --> 01:49:11.820
haven't played ever. So maybe I'll have to check it out and then, well, just when you thought your

01:49:11.820 --> 01:49:16.620
PC can run everything, they have to go and remaster crisis. So that's going to be coming

01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:22.780
out as well on PC PlayStation four, Xbox one and the switch. So if you got that brand new switch

01:49:22.780 --> 01:49:28.300
and you really want to turn it into a melted piece of rubble, then run some crisis remastered

01:49:28.300 --> 01:49:34.540
on that. And that should be coming out. Uh, let's see, I don't know if they have a date on that yet,

01:49:34.540 --> 01:49:40.300
but later this year. And, um, so what are we going to get with the remastered? Uh,

01:49:40.300 --> 01:49:47.660
it's going to actually have HD texture packs. I, uh, enhance campaign, improved art assets,

01:49:47.660 --> 01:49:53.900
temporal anti-aliasing, um, a lot of other fun stuff. And I assume that you have obviously

01:49:53.900 --> 01:50:00.460
switched probably running a little less of that, but, um, maybe even some retracing and stuff. So

01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:07.580
pretty awesome. Uh, we'll have to, uh, check it out. And fun fact, uh, the game was set in 2020.

01:50:07.580 --> 01:50:15.660
So yeah. How topical. All right. Well, moving on a little bit of a follow-up something we talked

01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:20.620
about last week and the fact that the, uh, Japanese Nintendo switch shipments were on hold

01:50:20.620 --> 01:50:24.860
because some of the, um, COVID related, uh, lockdowns and et cetera that are going on

01:50:24.860 --> 01:50:30.540
overseas, uh, a follow-up this week indicates that Nintendo will, uh, begin to resume shipping

01:50:30.540 --> 01:50:34.940
of Nintendo switch units later this week, which probably by the time now that I'm reading this

01:50:34.940 --> 01:50:39.740
already occurred, uh, they did halt the distribution of the console because of COVID-19

01:50:39.740 --> 01:50:44.940
related issues. Um, but because of global demand, they are continuing shipments. Um,

01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:50.940
so there you go, uh, that, that is continuing. So hopefully those get to be a little bit easier to

01:50:50.940 --> 01:50:55.420
find, but I also hope they are being done safely. I don't have a lot of details as to

01:50:56.060 --> 01:51:01.180
how they made that happen again, but hopefully it is safe. I don't know. Uh, also, uh, a quick

01:51:01.180 --> 01:51:06.460
update, awesome games done quick, uh, is going on. Well, it's not the awesome games done quick. It

01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:12.220
is actually, uh, Corona games done quick, I believe is the name of it. Um, Corona relief.

01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:17.820
Thank you. Corona relief done quick is going on right now. Uh, and they're actually wrapping up.

01:51:17.820 --> 01:51:22.860
I think they're on the last run they're on the, or did they finish? I think they might be completely

01:51:22.860 --> 01:51:27.340
done now. It might be. Yeah. I think I was anticipating we'd be at this story by seven 30,

01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:30.540
but they, uh, they're done now. It's eight o'clock. So they finished their last speed run.

01:51:30.540 --> 01:51:34.300
They are done. I didn't get the final fundraising number. I was going to go to the website to get

01:51:34.300 --> 01:51:37.820
the final fundraising number. Does anybody know how much they raised? It was that like

01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:42.060
200,000 or something when I checked earlier today, maybe somebody in our chat knows,

01:51:42.860 --> 01:51:48.940
but they, for being, um, all virtual and not being in a hotel and only being a weekend,

01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:53.980
not a week. Uh, they did a pretty darn good job. Uh, so I was going to get people an update on

01:51:53.980 --> 01:51:58.380
that, but unfortunately, since we got to it a little late, uh, they're done, it's over.

01:51:58.380 --> 01:52:06.140
So I don't know what the, thank you orange. Right. For just over $400,000, $400,529 and 60 cents.

01:52:06.140 --> 01:52:10.060
Thank you. Orange. Right. Uh, that's how much they ended up raising. So that's really good.

01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:14.060
Uh, again, considering that most of them go for a week and this one was just a weekend.

01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:19.020
Um, that's really good. Cool. Cool. All right. And they had an exhibition with a pump it up too.

01:52:19.020 --> 01:52:22.860
So that was pretty awesome. Oh, did they, I missed that. I saw a little earlier today when

01:52:23.740 --> 01:52:27.340
something like that I think was the username, but, um, they did like,

01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:32.860
uh, a live stream of some guy playing pump it up in his room or I assume in his house.

01:52:32.860 --> 01:52:35.260
That's awesome. All right. Uh, dark Sakura.

01:52:37.660 --> 01:52:41.740
Well, in, uh, other news, you know how we every so often bring in some like,

01:52:42.380 --> 01:52:46.940
like, I'm not going to say legit, but just like the financial, you know, stuff, right.

01:52:47.820 --> 01:52:54.540
You know, Bloomberg has touched on, um, on animal crossing and actually has named the game,

01:52:54.540 --> 01:53:01.820
the biggest hit of the lockdown. Um, and one of their, uh, research analysts that they work with,

01:53:01.820 --> 01:53:07.100
um, was saying, uh, that they have, and I'm going to read the quote. I have never seen so many

01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:13.580
people sharing so many screenshots of a single game on social networking sites. Um, and, uh,

01:53:13.580 --> 01:53:19.420
they're actually saying that Nintendo was likely to surpass its fiscal year sales numbers, um,

01:53:19.420 --> 01:53:24.780
which are going to be out on May 7th. Um, that basically, you know, we were talking last week

01:53:24.780 --> 01:53:28.860
about this being like the prime time to release this game. Right. I mean, not that it was done

01:53:28.860 --> 01:53:32.860
that way on purpose or that we would ever wish this, but it's just the way the cards,

01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:36.620
it was a silver lining. It was a blessing in disguise. And in this case, it looks like it's

01:53:36.620 --> 01:53:41.820
going to be an even bigger financial blessing for Nintendo, but, you know, again, on the personal

01:53:41.820 --> 01:53:47.980
side, it's been a blessing for the players. Absolutely. So it's brought people together

01:53:47.980 --> 01:53:53.100
in a way that they couldn't. And as you say, it's, it's more the mainstream financial press

01:53:53.100 --> 01:53:56.540
that's picking this up now. Like it's not just, we're saying, Oh, some blog is say this is,

01:53:56.540 --> 01:54:00.380
you know, what investors Bloomberg has, what investors look at. And on top of that,

01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:05.260
isn't Bloomberg, um, more conservative leaning as well. So to hear positive things from,

01:54:05.260 --> 01:54:10.460
you know, from Bloomberg about video games, their owner ran for the democratic nomination. So hard

01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:16.700
to say. Yeah. I might be thinking of Forbes. Yeah. And Forbes also runs a lot of clickbait.

01:54:16.700 --> 01:54:21.820
So I don't like if they run the article, I don't know. And they, yes, they're because, uh, that

01:54:21.820 --> 01:54:26.300
guy ran for Republican governor once, but it doesn't matter. Uh, the reality is Forbes has

01:54:26.300 --> 01:54:30.860
a lot of clickbait trash on their site. Sorry. Not sorry, but that's what it is. And, um, you know,

01:54:30.860 --> 01:54:36.620
this is a little more of the mainstream press. Exactly. Okay. Neat. What else?

01:54:36.700 --> 01:54:43.500
Yeah. Um, well, and also, um, I don't, I really don't know anyone who is still playing this. Um,

01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:47.180
so I guess this is actually maybe not be a big deal, but I know a lot of people still

01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:54.940
love to Pokemon rumble rush. Um, they are shutting it down on, uh, July 2nd, 2020. Um,

01:54:55.740 --> 01:55:05.020
that's, uh, been confirmed by, um, uh, Saturday who, um, I believe is hold on just a second.

01:55:07.020 --> 01:55:13.340
Yes. Uh, said it'd be.net, um, who basically follows a Pokemon news has, uh, got confirmation

01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:20.860
on it that, um, buying, uh, the purchase of Poke diamonds in the game. Um, it has been disabled.

01:55:20.860 --> 01:55:27.020
The unused diamonds in the game will be refunded when the game shuts down. So that's at 1 59 AM UTC

01:55:27.020 --> 01:55:33.340
on July 2nd, 2020. That means that the game was only on the market for just over a year.

01:55:33.340 --> 01:55:37.980
And I must admit, I forgot that rumble rush was even a thing. So I probably did not help

01:55:37.980 --> 01:55:42.220
this situation, but, uh, sorry to those that are fans of the game. Um, but it was,

01:55:42.220 --> 01:55:45.420
it was probably like, uh, when it comes to Pokemon and the mobile devices, I mean,

01:55:45.420 --> 01:55:50.380
Pokemon go is really, you know, the royalty thing it's, it's, it's going to be hard to compete. Any

01:55:50.380 --> 01:55:55.500
other Pokemon game kind of has to compete against itself. You know, I realized they're very

01:55:55.500 --> 01:56:00.860
different in how they play, but you know, there's still Pokemon, right? Yeah. And well, I mean,

01:56:01.100 --> 01:56:05.580
we know what the shit is, right? Yeah. So, all right. Well, this is the part of the show where

01:56:05.580 --> 01:56:11.100
we travel around the world and check out release dates. Um, I mean, cause we always have, but I

01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:14.780
know it's probably a little smaller just because of what's going on in the world, but I will ask

01:56:14.780 --> 01:56:20.620
anyway. Uh, Loki, do we have any U S releases this week? Uh, yeah, we have a few things. So,

01:56:20.620 --> 01:56:26.700
uh, starting off, we've got Azure Striker gun volt Striker pack coming out on PlayStation four.

01:56:27.420 --> 01:56:34.140
We've got, um, Boku Jaime project. That's going to be on Nintendo switch and PlayStation four,

01:56:35.020 --> 01:56:42.940
Moto GP 20 on PC, Nintendo switch PlayStation four X-Box one and Stadia, uh, Picross S4 on

01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:49.820
Nintendo switch. We have Naruto Shippuden ultimate Ninja storm four road to burrito.

01:56:50.780 --> 01:56:57.260
Uh, it looks like predator hunting grounds on PC and PlayStation four, uh, trials of Mana on

01:56:57.260 --> 01:57:03.980
PC and it's in the switch and PlayStation four. And last but not least, uh, X-Com chimera squad

01:57:03.980 --> 01:57:11.020
on PC. All right. Well, traveling over to Japan, boy, it was really slow in Japan last week,

01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:15.020
but this week is making up for it. There's a lot of new releases. Now, uh, things are picking up

01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:18.860
again again, though. I don't know how the current situation may affect some of these releases,

01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:23.100
but the information we have as of today are that these games are coming out in Japan this week on

01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:28.540
April 23rd on the Nintendo switch, uh, Naruto Shippuden ultimate Ninja storm four is coming

01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:35.100
out this week, uh, as well as super real mahjong love two through seven. That's clearly a mahjong

01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:39.500
collection of sorts is out this week. Little busters converted edition is out this week.

01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:43.580
Uh, that Boku Jaime project that Loki mentioned for the U S is also out in Japan this week.

01:57:43.580 --> 01:57:49.500
Celeste gets a physical release, uh, in Japan this week, uh, little town hero as well. And

01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:54.860
enter the Gungeon gets a Japanese release as well as Metro redo. Uh, all of this on the switch,

01:57:54.860 --> 01:58:02.140
Moto GP 20. And this game sounds awesome. B simulator is out on the switch this week.

01:58:02.140 --> 01:58:06.860
Is this a game that's been out over here for a while? Yeah. Oh, I got a, is it, is it good?

01:58:06.860 --> 01:58:12.380
It looks really pretty for the, and it's kind of, it looks neat. I I've actually browsed it at the

01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:17.020
store several times. So like, should I pick this up? But I need to look into this. Well,

01:58:17.020 --> 01:58:22.540
I'm going to, I'm going to read the description, see the world through the eyes of a bee compete

01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:26.460
with other bees in race. That would be kind of like, unfortunately it isn't actually showing

01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:31.980
you what a bee would see, uh, compete with other bees in races, collect pollen, perform waggle

01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:38.140
dances and explore a world inspired by central park in New York. I had no idea B simulator was

01:58:38.140 --> 01:58:43.100
a thing. Oh, the fact that's near central park and it has to do with bees reminds me it's,

01:58:43.100 --> 01:58:49.580
I'm getting too many bee movie vibes. Well, that's what that was. Can you, can you narrate bee movie

01:58:49.580 --> 01:58:52.940
while you play bee simulator? That's what I want to know. All right. Anyway,

01:58:53.500 --> 01:58:57.260
that is all good. Anything's possible. Anything's possible. Anyway, that's all on the Nintendo

01:58:57.260 --> 01:59:02.620
switch. I hope, I hope it's not one of the things where it's like, it sounds awesome. And then it's,

01:59:02.620 --> 01:59:07.820
it's garbage. It's shovelware. I really, my hopes are high for bee simulator. Let's just put it that

01:59:07.820 --> 01:59:13.820
way. Um, and on the PlayStation four this week, also bee simulator, Celeste Boku Hime project,

01:59:13.820 --> 01:59:19.820
a lot of the same games, um, Anoatsu line, uh, is out this week as well as zombie army four dead

01:59:19.820 --> 01:59:26.860
war, uh, Azure striker gun volt is out this week and, uh, trials of mana, uh, coinciding with the

01:59:26.860 --> 01:59:31.500
us and around the world on April 24th on the PlayStation four. And I might've missed that

01:59:31.500 --> 01:59:36.220
on the switch, but that should be the same on the switch as well. Yes it is. Well, it's an average

01:59:36.220 --> 01:59:46.380
of 6.5 on the, uh, well 65 on Metacritic. So that's too bad. That's too bad. All right.

01:59:46.380 --> 01:59:53.980
Uh, let's move on. Uh, dark soccer. How about the UK? So going on in the UK, a whopping three games

01:59:53.980 --> 02:00:02.380
we have, um, on 22nd of April, MotoGP 2020 on a PlayStation, Xbox switch and PC. We have deliver

02:00:02.380 --> 02:00:08.780
us the moon on, uh, the 23rd of April for PlayStation, Xbox and PC, and then on PlayStation

02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:17.020
and switch on the 23rd trials of mana. That's it. All right. Sad trombone expected. It's a little

02:00:17.020 --> 02:00:20.780
slow with the releases right now with everything else going on in the world. But, uh, I know even

02:00:20.780 --> 02:00:24.700
if it's, even if it's getting a not so great reviews, I know a lot of people are looking

02:00:24.700 --> 02:00:28.380
forward to that trials of manna. So there is that. All right. In this part of the show,

02:00:28.380 --> 02:00:33.260
we would typically go to our mailbag, participate at orangelandradio.com and read the emails,

02:00:33.260 --> 02:00:37.180
but I don't think we have any this week. At least last I checked, we didn't. We have no

02:00:37.180 --> 02:00:43.660
none after I cleaned out the leftover face. All right. Participate at orangelandradio.com is the

02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:48.620
place to send emails. If you would like to have your opinions or your, your, your thoughts read

02:00:48.620 --> 02:00:56.140
on a future week's show. So we'll get back into some more news. So Loki. All right. So, um, we

02:00:56.140 --> 02:01:01.500
talked about this a little bit before they, where they had a steam games festival. I want to say

02:01:01.500 --> 02:01:07.660
that was back in March or something, um, where it's basically a bunch of demos and whatnot

02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:11.900
that are put up by independent developers. So you can check out their games. Yeah. Kind of

02:01:11.900 --> 02:01:17.900
replaced GDC. If I remember, it was kind of the, the, yeah. Yeah. So, um, because we are lacking

02:01:17.900 --> 02:01:23.100
an E3 this year, they're going to be doing a steam games festival summer edition from

02:01:23.100 --> 02:01:28.380
June 9th through the 14th. And they have registrations up now for developers to submit

02:01:28.380 --> 02:01:33.660
games for that as well. Um, so it could be, you know, limited time demos, short playable

02:01:33.660 --> 02:01:38.300
experiences, uh, allows you to actually, you know, connect with developers and whatnot.

02:01:38.940 --> 02:01:43.660
Plus you can wishlist any of the games that you see there. So, uh, that's pretty cool. I didn't

02:01:43.660 --> 02:01:48.540
get a chance to check it out last time during GDC. So I'm hoping that this time I can actually play

02:01:48.540 --> 02:01:53.740
some of these things, uh, because there were some that were mixed in there for the GDC one that,

02:01:53.740 --> 02:01:57.340
um, were actually games I was looking forward to checking out. So we'll have to see.

02:01:58.780 --> 02:02:03.260
Yeah. I love the idea of a virtual expo that we can all participate in. If nothing else,

02:02:03.260 --> 02:02:06.860
um, I'm sure it'll be primarily a lot of indie titles, but there's a lot of great

02:02:06.860 --> 02:02:13.420
indie titles. So why not? It'll be a really good thing. So, uh, and, uh, Jeff Keeley being involved

02:02:13.420 --> 02:02:19.980
it's interesting too. So, yeah, we'll see how that goes. All right. Uh, moving on talking about,

02:02:19.980 --> 02:02:24.060
uh, you know, earlier I talked about how Japan is making Nintendo switches again,

02:02:24.060 --> 02:02:29.580
and it does seem like everywhere Nintendo switch is having a shortage and, uh, bots apparently

02:02:29.580 --> 02:02:33.420
are to blame for some of this. This was something that was linked in our discord server, actually.

02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:38.780
So thank you guys for sharing the story over at vognetwork.com slash discord, where we do pull

02:02:38.780 --> 02:02:44.300
some of our stories from, uh, what you guys want to hear about. Um, so there's actually the story

02:02:44.300 --> 02:02:48.780
that vice, uh, was running with. That's talking about how there is a bot out there that was built

02:02:48.780 --> 02:02:55.020
for discord, uh, that somebody built, uh, that really it wasn't originally built for the switch

02:02:55.020 --> 02:02:58.700
because there's all these other like markets where they try to buy things up and resell them.

02:02:58.700 --> 02:03:04.060
Sneakers is what this was really made for. Um, but the switch seemed like a opportune market.

02:03:04.060 --> 02:03:08.620
So it was used, uh, for this as well. And of course, uh, in this day and age,

02:03:08.620 --> 02:03:12.940
a lot of folks are, uh, looking for Nintendo switches to help

02:03:12.940 --> 02:03:18.860
fill time with kids around and not a lot to do at home outside of virtual studies.

02:03:18.860 --> 02:03:23.660
So it's kind of driving up the demand for a switch. So resellers are looking to make a quick buck.

02:03:23.660 --> 02:03:30.540
Um, obviously the easiest way to stop resellers for being successful would be to stop buying.

02:03:30.540 --> 02:03:36.540
But I think the reality is you have a lot of families, uh, that don't understand and that

02:03:36.540 --> 02:03:41.100
are just like, I need this. So I'm going to spend all this money because maybe they have

02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:45.740
more disposable money to then turn around to these people who are flipping these things.

02:03:45.740 --> 02:03:51.660
And there's a discord bot that is actually running a lot of this, uh, where they, you can actually

02:03:51.660 --> 02:03:57.580
buy through discord and it kind of does a lot of the process for you so that you don't have to like

02:03:57.580 --> 02:04:01.980
go in and fill out your address and all that stuff by hand. These bots are kind of tailored

02:04:01.980 --> 02:04:07.420
to the websites to move them, move through them for you. Um, I would wish that these retailers

02:04:07.420 --> 02:04:11.740
would limit how many of this stuff you can buy. And I imagine they probably do. And there's

02:04:11.740 --> 02:04:16.140
probably ways that these guys have worked around that as well. So I don't want to say like, Oh,

02:04:16.140 --> 02:04:20.220
they haven't thought of it because I'm sure a lot of these retailers are trying to think of ways to

02:04:20.220 --> 02:04:24.780
combat this as well. Cause the reselling market doesn't always look good for them either. Um,

02:04:24.780 --> 02:04:30.460
but the reality is it hasn't happened yet. Um, but what I think is just crazy about this and also

02:04:30.460 --> 02:04:35.740
kind of sad is that what's happening in the discord server, people are trying to capitalize

02:04:35.740 --> 02:04:40.700
on the stimulus payments that just went out this week. Uh, one apparent reseller in the discord

02:04:40.700 --> 02:04:45.180
said quote, yeah, mine are taking so long to deliver. I want them to hurry up while everyone

02:04:45.180 --> 02:04:52.860
still has some money. So people hoping to make all that, you know, get, get that stimulus money,

02:04:52.860 --> 02:05:00.060
uh, to buy upsold Nintendo switch again, obviously these folks can't be stopped.

02:05:00.060 --> 02:05:05.660
They're just going to change the technology to match whatever the websites do to stop them.

02:05:05.660 --> 02:05:12.220
It would be great if the stores would only allow one per address, but I also realize, you know,

02:05:12.220 --> 02:05:16.540
people are probably buying them for pickup. They put them in kids' names. They have go to other

02:05:16.540 --> 02:05:20.540
places. They probably have all these ideas they do to work around them. So what we really need to do

02:05:20.540 --> 02:05:25.500
is stop supporting the resale market because that's ultimately what's going to dry it up.

02:05:25.500 --> 02:05:31.260
But the reality is you and me are not the ones that are driving that market up.

02:05:31.900 --> 02:05:37.500
So we have to help spread the word that the, thank you, that the reasons are Alan just for the,

02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:41.740
on the podcast, Alan just brought me a drink. Thank you. Um, oh wait, they're not paying for

02:05:41.740 --> 02:05:46.140
advertisement. Why am I putting their label forward? Um, here, look at the nutrition facts.

02:05:46.140 --> 02:05:52.060
Um, so, uh, yeah, we have to stop supporting the resale market and then they'll stop doing this.

02:05:52.060 --> 02:06:01.500
But until then, this is unfortunately part of it. So anyway, let's move on. Hopefully you're to

02:06:01.500 --> 02:06:05.100
happier news. Actually. Yes. I think this story is very cool. Dark Sakura.

02:06:06.380 --> 02:06:13.020
Yeah. So, um, and now it is kind of hit or miss cool in my opinion. And I'll tell you

02:06:13.100 --> 02:06:20.300
after I've announced it. So, um, the Getty, um, as in the Getty center, um, you know, art,

02:06:20.300 --> 02:06:25.820
all of that, um, basically they have a tool, um, called the animal crossing art generator,

02:06:25.820 --> 02:06:31.500
which you can pick out one of your favorite works of art, crop it down and auto-generated QR code

02:06:31.500 --> 02:06:35.980
that you can use in new horizons using the switch online mobile, uh, tool, you know,

02:06:35.980 --> 02:06:40.540
using the switch online tool. And it's pretty cool. So you can get it through your milk link.

02:06:40.540 --> 02:06:48.780
Um, now the one thing that I do not like, um, is that it really isn't very clear at all. Um,

02:06:49.580 --> 02:06:53.580
it looks like blurs on the wall, really. So, I mean, you get the concept of the art way. I mean,

02:06:53.580 --> 02:06:57.340
and then again, it is pretty neat, you know, it's a great thing. I think that I used, um,

02:06:57.340 --> 02:07:02.620
the pattern maker tool in conjunction with this one. Um, and they also have like their full step

02:07:02.620 --> 02:07:06.460
by step walkthrough on how to get you through that for people who haven't done this before.

02:07:07.340 --> 02:07:15.180
Um, but really, um, it's a good way for people to, I guess, expose more, more natural art out

02:07:15.180 --> 02:07:21.020
there. Now I did open up and take a look through the Getty museums, um, uh, art generator.

02:07:21.020 --> 02:07:25.180
They didn't have any of the artists that I was interested in. I like, I looked for Frida Kahlo.

02:07:25.180 --> 02:07:32.380
I looked for Banksy. I looked for some more, uh, you know, uh, uh, crap. What was her name? Uh,

02:07:32.380 --> 02:07:37.580
Hannah, I always forget her name, but she actually was, um, one of the Weimar Bauhaus.

02:07:37.580 --> 02:07:40.860
I could see if there's Mondrian, that would probably translate very well. Um,

02:07:41.660 --> 02:07:46.620
but I mean, the thing is that, um, it's a good way to expose, uh, people to art, to have some

02:07:46.620 --> 02:07:51.500
fine pieces of art in their own museum. There's no Mondrian. That's sad. Yeah. It is kind of a

02:07:51.500 --> 02:07:56.940
limited, uh, search on here, but it is still pretty cool. It just doesn't come out very cleanly,

02:07:56.940 --> 02:08:02.140
if that makes sense. Yeah. Um, and you know, I know some folks might be thinking, Oh God,

02:08:02.140 --> 02:08:06.300
another animal crossing story. But I mean, this is like, when you have a museum,

02:08:07.900 --> 02:08:12.940
well, and then when you have a museum embracing that part of pop culture to try to get more people

02:08:12.940 --> 02:08:16.940
interested in what the museum does, the art, I kind of think that's extremely newsworthy.

02:08:16.940 --> 02:08:21.980
Don't you? Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. And especially to the links, like the fact that

02:08:21.980 --> 02:08:26.380
they are, it's not just like, Oh, T he, somebody set up a fit. It's like, no, the museum is

02:08:26.780 --> 02:08:32.540
getting these QR codes for you to put in your town. And yeah, I mean, the QR code stuff is

02:08:32.540 --> 02:08:38.300
limited. Like I have a picture of Mr. Smoosh in Smoosh land, but, um, and when you see it,

02:08:38.300 --> 02:08:42.460
it's grainy and it's not that great, but it gets the point across. And I think that's what this is

02:08:42.460 --> 02:08:49.020
for too. If it starts a conversation about art, then it's a win. Right. So I think it's pretty

02:08:49.020 --> 02:08:54.380
cool, but yeah, probably, probably very limited on what they have the rights to reproduce in this

02:08:54.380 --> 02:08:58.860
manner. Um, although it would be cool to, you know, a lot of that stuff that you're talking

02:08:58.860 --> 02:09:03.500
about would be very cool. Um, Marissa, uh, Marissa's in our chat. It's so good to see you

02:09:04.380 --> 02:09:08.220
saying, uh, you could probably get an idea of what would be available by checking out the Getty

02:09:08.220 --> 02:09:13.260
museum collections online. Yeah. And then, you know, if it drives you to their website to get

02:09:13.260 --> 02:09:17.900
these QR codes, then you're exploring the museum in a sense, or you're thinking about, Oh, maybe

02:09:17.900 --> 02:09:23.180
I want to see this art in real life and all that good stuff. Yeah, exactly. So win, win all around,

02:09:23.180 --> 02:09:27.420
especially when museums are probably hurting right now because they don't have foot traffic.

02:09:27.420 --> 02:09:32.780
So, yeah. Anyway. All right, moving on, uh, just a few more stories and then, uh, we'll take a

02:09:32.780 --> 02:09:39.500
listener round table questions in our chat room. Uh, let's move on to Loki. Yes. So, uh, one of the

02:09:39.500 --> 02:09:44.860
things, I mean, we've been all waiting for the Minecraft, you know, uh, fancy graphics pack to

02:09:44.860 --> 02:09:50.620
come out. And unfortunately, since, um, the 4k texture pack that was supposed to be coming out

02:09:50.620 --> 02:09:54.380
Xbox one and PlayStation four, I think we're just Xbox one and PC at one point,

02:09:54.940 --> 02:10:01.580
uh, got canceled. We had to kind of wait for the whole, uh, Minecraft RTX, um,

02:10:02.460 --> 02:10:08.380
update to be coming out to actually add real ray tracing to the game. And so now they have that in

02:10:08.380 --> 02:10:16.140
beta as well to actually check it out. So if you opt in through the, um, Xbox, uh, beta program

02:10:16.140 --> 02:10:24.140
and actually get the, uh, Minecraft with RTX and happen to have a computer with an RTX, uh, GPU,

02:10:24.140 --> 02:10:30.380
so, uh, RTX 2060 through 2080, uh, then you can actually check this game out. Um, they also,

02:10:31.260 --> 02:10:36.540
what's unique about it though is because they're changing the way the graphics are set up in the

02:10:36.540 --> 02:10:42.700
game, all the textures, um, they only have specific texture packs and maps that work with it right

02:10:42.700 --> 02:10:50.380
now. So you, those are being offered for free as well. I happen to have a PC that can run RTX. And

02:10:50.380 --> 02:11:00.060
so I did get to check that out this week. Well, lucky you, cause I don't, it, it looks really

02:11:00.060 --> 02:11:07.500
cool. I mean, it really does look like a different game. Um, it's, it's interesting though, like some

02:11:07.500 --> 02:11:13.260
of the, like just everything they have there, like the atmospheric lighting that's in there now

02:11:13.260 --> 02:11:18.140
is just pretty incredible. Like if you actually go and try to go down into caves and stuff like that

02:11:18.140 --> 02:11:25.020
with torches, like it doesn't illuminate very much and it gets extremely pitch black and, um, they

02:11:25.020 --> 02:11:30.060
have surfaces now they can set up like mirrors. I mean, you, if you're swimming under water,

02:11:30.060 --> 02:11:35.900
you see the reflection of everything under the water and the top of the water or the surface.

02:11:35.900 --> 02:11:43.420
Um, just some incredible looking, um, graphics there, the god rays and everything. Um, and

02:11:43.420 --> 02:11:48.460
actually runs pretty good on my laptop. So that's pretty cool. Um, you have to show it to me when

02:11:48.460 --> 02:11:53.980
we can hang out again. Yes. Yes. I'll have to do that. Um, I did end up uninstalling it after I

02:11:53.980 --> 02:11:58.460
played through for a little bit because it's not compatible with my realms and everything,

02:11:58.460 --> 02:12:04.220
uh, because it's beta, but it's pretty cool. There were some glitches I ran into at one point where

02:12:04.220 --> 02:12:09.980
stuff, uh, stop drawing in a little bit. So obviously it's in beta and they're working on

02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:14.220
it, but it looks incredible. Like if this is something that maybe can be supported with the

02:12:14.220 --> 02:12:19.020
next generation of consoles, I mean, I think people are going to be having a pretty good

02:12:19.020 --> 02:12:24.940
time with it. So, um, definitely check it out. If you own Minecraft on PC and can get into this

02:12:24.940 --> 02:12:28.860
beta program, which is pretty easy to do. I was going to say I was really f*****g bitter

02:12:28.860 --> 02:12:33.100
that the super duper graphics pack kind of got scrapped. And then this came out instead

02:12:33.100 --> 02:12:40.700
for a $500 graphics card that I don't own, but, um, it does seem very logical that the PC folks

02:12:40.700 --> 02:12:45.020
and the folks playing this right now are the beta test crowd. And that where this is ultimately

02:12:45.020 --> 02:12:50.860
going to end up is on the next X-Box and presumably PlayStation five. I mean, yes,

02:12:50.860 --> 02:12:56.700
Minecraft is a Microsoft product, but they still kind of put stuff on switch and Sony. So, I mean,

02:12:56.700 --> 02:13:00.220
assumably it'll be there too. It'd probably just come out later for PlayStation, but yeah,

02:13:00.220 --> 02:13:04.700
they're going to have, I don't know if it would necessarily work on those consoles because their

02:13:04.700 --> 02:13:12.300
GPU's are based around the ATI technology. So, uh, it's hard to say, or it's ATI is kind of

02:13:12.300 --> 02:13:18.700
antiquated AMD technology, but, um, I, I would be interested to see if they can adapt it for that,

02:13:18.700 --> 02:13:22.940
but like if they still have the groundwork for the stuff, then maybe it'll work or it'll come up.

02:13:24.940 --> 02:13:28.220
Yeah. Cause when I heard it was like Ray tracing, I was like, Oh, well that's where the next,

02:13:28.220 --> 02:13:31.580
that's what they keep talking about for the next series of consoles. So that seems like the logical

02:13:31.580 --> 02:13:36.940
progression, but okay. Maybe not so easy then. Interesting. Okay. Bobby says in chat, uh, by

02:13:36.940 --> 02:13:41.660
Blackwell says hardware Ray tracing is hardware Ray tracing the ATI cards will have it. They'll

02:13:41.660 --> 02:13:47.980
just have to port it. So it won't be such a, maybe like easy type of transition, you know,

02:13:47.980 --> 02:13:52.540
hopefully not too bad, but we'll see. All right. Yeah. I could, I could see support for it at some

02:13:52.540 --> 02:13:58.940
point. All right. Lastly, but not leastly tonight, this is a story. What like, honestly,

02:13:58.940 --> 02:14:03.100
what the fuck is going on with cookie mama? That is, that is what we're calling this segment.

02:14:03.100 --> 02:14:07.740
What the fuck is going on with cookie mama? Because like there have been stories all over

02:14:07.740 --> 02:14:13.900
the internet about cooking mama and it's, uh, that the, the cooking mama is mining Bitcoin.

02:14:13.900 --> 02:14:19.180
Remember that one that was around like two weeks ago. Um, yeah, it's just a mess. And apparently,

02:14:19.580 --> 02:14:25.020
mama, mama can't even fix her own damn game. Um, there's issues going on with cooking mama cook

02:14:25.020 --> 02:14:31.180
star is the actual name of the game that just came out for switch. Well, sort of, um, the game's

02:14:31.180 --> 02:14:36.860
license holder and the publisher are fighting online about who is controlling this. The original

02:14:36.860 --> 02:14:43.580
developer of the DS game office create licensed cook star to planet entertainment in 2018.

02:14:43.580 --> 02:14:48.140
Uh, they decided together on a game design and then it came out on the Nintendo switch in March

02:14:48.140 --> 02:14:53.100
and then was pulled from the shelves because office create said it failed to meet the

02:14:53.100 --> 02:14:57.580
standards its customers expect and deserve. So I guess it wasn't really mining Bitcoin.

02:14:57.580 --> 02:15:03.820
It was just bad. So I don't know. Um, so what I understand, like I watched like a video of like,

02:15:03.820 --> 02:15:07.420
what, what happened with that? Oh, did a YouTuber explain it in three hours?

02:15:08.460 --> 02:15:12.940
No, there's, so there's this, um, there's a channel that I watched that they did explain.

02:15:12.940 --> 02:15:16.700
It wasn't three hours. It was like a pretty short video, but they explained that, um,

02:15:16.700 --> 02:15:21.500
the guy that works for that publishing company doesn't even really understand what Bitcoin is.

02:15:21.500 --> 02:15:27.980
They just thought they'd drop blockchain in there that that would entice people cause it's tech and

02:15:27.980 --> 02:15:32.460
everybody's talking about blockchain nowadays. I am sorry. I love this comment too much from

02:15:32.460 --> 02:15:37.180
our chat. See a Tiberian chat says I was hoping it would be an accounting conspiracy. So it would

02:15:37.180 --> 02:15:48.140
be cooking, cooking mama's books. Uh, funny. That's great. Uh, all right. Anyway, uh, yeah.

02:15:48.140 --> 02:15:52.300
And Bobby Bakloff says, yes, same blockchain gets you investor funding. It sure does.

02:15:52.300 --> 02:15:58.540
Uh, so anyway, office create is now saying legal action against planet is probably going to happen

02:15:58.540 --> 02:16:05.660
to protect its customers. Uh, but planet doesn't give a fuck. They said on the official cook star

02:16:05.660 --> 02:16:10.540
Twitter, uh, said that the issue has to do with creative differences. There is no active

02:16:10.540 --> 02:16:15.100
litigation or ruling that prevents planet from publishing this game. Um, it may still come out

02:16:15.100 --> 02:16:20.140
on the switch. This game is already turning into a huge collector's item, uh, for people to find

02:16:20.140 --> 02:16:29.980
and so forth. Uh, this is crazy. So, wow. But anyway, cooking mama may not be the mama you

02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:34.860
remember. Did you want to say something to me? No, I'm sorry. I didn't realize my mic wasn't

02:16:34.860 --> 02:16:42.140
muted or typing what I was because I was, I was, uh, trying to do a, a, a well thought out

02:16:42.140 --> 02:16:47.260
reply on actually something very similar. Um, Oh, see, there it went. Yeah. I am so sorry. I

02:16:47.260 --> 02:16:53.180
didn't mean to just clack away cause that, that ain't me. Um, but anyway, um, I'm just like,

02:16:53.740 --> 02:17:00.060
I keep thinking mama ain't fixing shit. You're going to have to fix this one for

02:17:00.060 --> 02:17:07.980
your dance. Her wine break slam, you know, to quote, uh, that line by the, uh, uh, late great,

02:17:07.980 --> 02:17:14.140
uh, now I can't think of her name, uh, be Arthur mama's on a cruise ship and she's stuck.

02:17:14.140 --> 02:17:20.940
So mama's on a cruise ship with the COVID. Okay. Don't joke about that. All right. So

02:17:20.940 --> 02:17:26.220
I'm not, well I am, but I'm also really mad at the cruise industry. So there's that. Um,

02:17:27.020 --> 02:17:32.860
but, um, but I mean the thing is, is that it is a shit show from the beginning and

02:17:34.380 --> 02:17:39.500
people are going to say what they're going to say. You know, the truth is there somewhere.

02:17:39.500 --> 02:17:42.380
No, one's going to care what it is cause they still want to only believe what they want to

02:17:42.380 --> 02:17:48.300
think. End of story. All right. Well let's, what is Mr. Smush? Can you, is that getting picked up

02:17:48.300 --> 02:17:54.700
by the mic? Mr. Smush is like screaming over there. Yeah. Oh boy. All right. Anyway, uh,

02:17:54.780 --> 02:17:58.460
let's move on. That was actually our last story that we have planned for tonight. So we're going

02:17:58.460 --> 02:18:03.660
to open up the listener round table via our chat room over at twitch.tv slash a VOG network. So if

02:18:03.660 --> 02:18:08.860
you have a question or something you want to ask on the show, uh, please go ahead and ask in the

02:18:08.860 --> 02:18:14.300
chat and we'll get to it. Um, and yeah, everybody in chat is screaming about Mr. Smoosh. Yes.

02:18:14.300 --> 02:18:20.380
So she wants to say something. I know he always, okay. He always does this after he uses the

02:18:20.380 --> 02:18:28.220
litter box. Like he has to announce to the entire household. Exactly. Like, and that is what just

02:18:28.220 --> 02:18:33.660
happened. I heard scratching noises and then I heard like now he's screaming. He doesn't have

02:18:33.660 --> 02:18:38.540
a problem with his butt. I hope not. Um, I it's, it's kind of hard to say cause we can't really

02:18:38.540 --> 02:18:42.860
take him to the vet or anything right now, but everything's normal in the litter box

02:18:42.860 --> 02:18:47.020
in that department. So I don't think it's anything like that, but it's just catism.

02:18:47.020 --> 02:18:51.580
My cat does the same thing. Every time she sees me, she screams at me every time.

02:18:51.580 --> 02:18:55.260
Well, Midna's thing is that no matter if it's food time or not, she's still going to follow

02:18:55.260 --> 02:19:00.060
you into that front bathroom. Cause that's where we feed her. And now Mr. Smoosh is just lying on

02:19:00.060 --> 02:19:05.020
the kitchen floor. Like his entire world has ended because I guess he wants more food. So I don't

02:19:05.020 --> 02:19:10.460
know. He just ate everybody. You know what I did today, Rob? Hmm. What's that? You know, I had

02:19:10.460 --> 02:19:18.300
sashimi for dinner. Yes. Midna has had her first taste of sashimi. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. We, uh, Alan

02:19:18.300 --> 02:19:23.100
feeds the cat all the time, all the time. Like just, just a little bit of human food, just a

02:19:23.100 --> 02:19:27.100
little bit. And you know, appropriately like, you know, he, he, he's very good at taking care of

02:19:27.100 --> 02:19:32.060
kitties. But like, for example, last night we tried a new barbecue place that we'd never had before

02:19:32.060 --> 02:19:38.060
we did, uh, it was our date night. So we did, you know, delivery food and, um, we had a new bar,

02:19:38.060 --> 02:19:42.860
like a local barbecue place we'd never had before. And, uh, Mr. Smoosh got to have just

02:19:42.860 --> 02:19:47.660
a little bit, just a little bit of the barbecue chicken, just a little bit. So, but that's why

02:19:47.660 --> 02:19:53.660
Mr. Smoosh is more chonk than he was when we, uh, adopted him as a rescue kitty. He was very skinny

02:19:53.660 --> 02:20:00.380
then. Now he's chonk. I gave him Midna cheese a year ago and now she has like cheese radar. She

02:20:00.380 --> 02:20:06.780
knows when it's actually cheese that's coming out, but she was all about the sushi, the sashimi.

02:20:06.780 --> 02:20:12.220
Cause I can't have a lot of rice, even though I love rice. Um, so I just, Dan's like, get what

02:20:12.220 --> 02:20:16.780
you want for your birthday dinner. And I'm like, sashimi. And so I gave Midna, eventually ate a

02:20:16.780 --> 02:20:23.180
whole slice, like a whole ounce of fish. Uh, a question from DJ Rama S in our chat room. Uh,

02:20:23.180 --> 02:20:29.340
what is the quarantine drink of choice right now? Mine is Tito's vodka and Pepsi cause Rite Aid was

02:20:29.340 --> 02:20:36.620
out of Coke. Um, I don't do a lot of alcoholic drinking really. Um, but, um, we've been drinking

02:20:36.620 --> 02:20:42.060
a lot more soda, which is bad because we're drinking like diet soda and Coke Zero and stuff

02:20:42.060 --> 02:20:47.980
like, and I fully admit it's trash. We shouldn't be drinking them, but you want comfort food right

02:20:47.980 --> 02:20:52.860
now in this whole circumstance. And I will say again, I guess I'm giving free advertising,

02:20:52.860 --> 02:20:57.260
but it is what it is. Diet Coke has these different flavors right now that are really

02:20:57.260 --> 02:21:02.220
good. Like they have a blood orange diet Coke. Um, and I love that one. It was weird to me.

02:21:02.220 --> 02:21:05.900
I love that one, but I also really love the ginger lime and that's what we have,

02:21:05.900 --> 02:21:12.620
um, a ton of right now. So, and Alan really likes the, um, orange vanilla Coke Zero. So there's a

02:21:12.620 --> 02:21:18.700
lot of like diet Coke, terrible products in our house. Um, but which is weird because I'm usually

02:21:18.700 --> 02:21:23.820
a Pepsi person. So if it's, if it's non diet, I prefer Pepsi, but if it's diet, I prefer Coke.

02:21:23.820 --> 02:21:30.060
Isn't that weird? But it's what it is. Yeah. Yeah. But I, um, like here though, it's been,

02:21:30.060 --> 02:21:35.900
um, I really love dietary Pepsi. Um, but right now we just have diet Coke cause our diet diet

02:21:35.900 --> 02:21:40.060
Coke, because that's what Dan found at seven 11, which happened to be open after nine. Everything

02:21:40.060 --> 02:21:46.940
else is not. Um, but, um, you know, like I said, I was gifted that bottle of, uh, Godiva chocolate

02:21:46.940 --> 02:21:53.340
liquor. Um, and I forgot about my very loaded bar that I have because I kept wanting to experiment

02:21:53.420 --> 02:21:58.860
with beverages after watching cocktail chemistry. So I have, you know, I have vermouth, I have gin

02:21:58.860 --> 02:22:06.060
in my freezer. I have, um, the Nika coffee grain whiskey that my bestie got me for, uh, holidays.

02:22:06.700 --> 02:22:12.940
Um, I have larceny, uh, bourbon, which is also really good. It's a non rye. I don't like

02:22:12.940 --> 02:22:18.380
practically anything right. Um, I've also got Kraken, which makes every diet soda taste like

02:22:18.380 --> 02:22:27.260
an oatmeal cookie, which is amazing. I have Tuaka. I have, um, crap. I have, um, Grand Marnier,

02:22:27.260 --> 02:22:31.180
which I'm actually thinking of taking the Godiva and the Grand Marnier and make myself a chocolate

02:22:31.180 --> 02:22:37.980
orange. Um, I have a creme de mint. I have creme de cacao, which I usually use baking. So I don't

02:22:37.980 --> 02:22:45.660
have the best quality. Um, yeah. Um, I also have, uh, a thing, uh, I have some brandy.

02:22:45.660 --> 02:22:50.540
I also have some Hennessy left a little bit of Hennessy. Um, I have a touch of a bit of

02:22:50.540 --> 02:22:55.740
hypnotic left in my fridge. I have a Pinot Noir rosé. I've got like two bottles of wine. That's

02:22:55.740 --> 02:23:00.940
it. Uh, let me, let me quickly read some comments from chat. Cause now you're, now you're, now you're

02:23:00.940 --> 02:23:09.260
sounding like a, a Bubba gun shrimp in this and shrimp in this all your alcohol. I'm just saying

02:23:09.260 --> 02:23:15.900
when I've had the, when I've had the, the wild urge, I've got to hook up. Now I have the Godiva,

02:23:15.900 --> 02:23:20.060
which is what I really wanted. Marissa's in our chat saying the guava one, I think talking about

02:23:20.060 --> 02:23:25.500
the diet soda is awesome. Leave me my one vice diet cancer. That's how I feel. Like, look,

02:23:25.500 --> 02:23:29.500
you can sit there and tell me about how diet soda is horrible for you. And my answer is,

02:23:29.500 --> 02:23:35.500
bitch, I know, but these are trying times. And if a diet soda is going to make me happy,

02:23:35.500 --> 02:23:41.980
let me fucking live. Okay. Like we'll, we'll address the caking the diet soda habit after

02:23:41.980 --> 02:23:46.700
we get on the other side of this. Okay. That's, that's what I'm leaving it as. Um, and then, uh,

02:23:46.700 --> 02:23:51.980
there was some other comments I wanted to say here. Um, let's see, uh, Meesh in our chat says

02:23:51.980 --> 02:23:56.460
our drink of choice has been chocolate Coca-Cola. Ooh, that's really good too. It's good. Chocolate

02:23:56.460 --> 02:24:01.660
Coke. Yeah. Um, well there's, I, um, there's definitely chocolate Cola out there and I feel

02:24:01.660 --> 02:24:06.140
like chocolate Coke is a thing. I don't know if it's something in America though,

02:24:06.140 --> 02:24:10.540
you'll have to ask me where they're getting that. Now I have to tell you, I can't drink sugary Coke

02:24:10.540 --> 02:24:15.340
like at all. Cause it just tastes too clean to me. But that, uh, strawberry Coke that they had

02:24:15.340 --> 02:24:22.780
in Japan and the peach Coke and me who does not like peach, peach Coke was good. Uh, Ziba in chat

02:24:22.780 --> 02:24:27.180
says we've been drinking a lot of different flavors of spindrift. Uh, and some folks talking

02:24:27.180 --> 02:24:31.180
about Jackbox games and kind of using that to pass the time right now. A lot of people doing that on

02:24:31.660 --> 02:24:36.540
Zoom. And some folks have asked if we're going to do a vog game night of sorts. And the answer is,

02:24:36.540 --> 02:24:41.260
um, yeah, I guess we need to plan something like that. Don't we? Um, I still want to do the Amazon

02:24:41.260 --> 02:24:46.540
watch party on my personal channel, but the selections are so limited. Like I don't know

02:24:46.540 --> 02:24:52.300
what I would stream. I'm like there's old seasons of survivor, but the problem with streaming those

02:24:52.300 --> 02:24:56.620
is that you kind of like already know who's going to go. So I don't know if it's as exciting, but

02:24:56.620 --> 02:25:01.900
I did. I did consider old seasons of America's next top model because I don't know those as

02:25:01.900 --> 02:25:07.580
well. So there would still be surprises in them. Uh, and maybe actually the actual season. I have

02:25:07.580 --> 02:25:13.420
to see if they have that season that I always reference here on OLR with Tiffany with the,

02:25:13.420 --> 02:25:17.340
we were rooting for you. We were all rooting for you. I feel like that should be the thing maybe

02:25:17.340 --> 02:25:24.380
that I should stream if they have that season. So VG realness says, OMG bitch America's next top

02:25:24.380 --> 02:25:29.020
model. I would be there for, so, okay. Maybe, maybe that's going to be the show. Maybe I'll

02:25:29.020 --> 02:25:35.180
do some, uh, uh, chairside watching of the season with Tiffany on it. Was that season four?

02:25:35.180 --> 02:25:39.580
Go back to the drink thing real quick. You know what is not in my house? Fucking La Croix.

02:25:43.260 --> 02:25:48.540
Shit's nasty. I love it. I love it. All right. Uh, I think that's going to do it for the listener.

02:25:48.540 --> 02:25:53.180
Uh, round table tonight. Thank you guys very much for the, uh, uh, comments and all that. You know,

02:25:53.180 --> 02:25:56.860
you guys always make this a good time. Really appreciate you guys being here and hanging out

02:25:56.860 --> 02:26:00.620
with us on a Sunday night. Um, keeping us going through these really tough times. Really

02:26:00.620 --> 02:26:05.500
appreciate it. You know what we didn't do? Cause we had no emails. We didn't do drag race talk.

02:26:05.500 --> 02:26:10.540
Well, cause I'm not watching drag race this season. What? Yeah, I'm not. I I'm taking a

02:26:10.540 --> 02:26:12.460
drag race and I are seeing other people for a little bit.

02:26:15.180 --> 02:26:18.860
We have some last minute story. Yeah, no. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What do you, what do you want to

02:26:18.860 --> 02:26:24.220
say for last minute stories, Loki? Um, so let's talk a little bit about, uh, Riot Games purchasing

02:26:24.220 --> 02:26:31.820
Hytale and, um, the developers of Hypixel studios, or I should say their, their developer Hypixel

02:26:31.820 --> 02:26:35.900
studios. So Hytale, if you may remember, we talked about a little bit before, um,

02:26:35.900 --> 02:26:42.300
it's sort of like a Minecraft game mixed with a little bit more RPG elements. Um, so it's gonna

02:26:42.300 --> 02:26:50.140
be interesting and see what they do with that. Um, so that's supposed to be, um, really the game

02:26:50.140 --> 02:26:55.660
is still not yet out, but it's supposed to be released sometime in 2021. Um, we talked a little

02:26:55.660 --> 02:27:01.500
bit about, uh, HD rat remasters of some classic games. Well, guess what? We talked about this

02:27:01.500 --> 02:27:09.500
before, but it's right around the corner now. So, um, checks quest HD is, um, going to be coming

02:27:09.500 --> 02:27:16.060
out on steam. Apparently it is going to be a free to play game when it comes out as well. Oh joy.

02:27:17.100 --> 02:27:20.220
If you want to, you know, check it out. Uh, it's going to be launching this summer

02:27:21.500 --> 02:27:26.700
and then hard to complain about free, I guess. And checks, checks, miss checks,

02:27:26.700 --> 02:27:30.220
mix is pretty good. And like, they're not even paying me to say that. So like,

02:27:30.220 --> 02:27:38.380
it's just legit something I I'm craving now. Damn it. And speaking of, uh, free, uh, Sony has,

02:27:38.380 --> 02:27:43.900
um, offered, um, I guess a couple of things for the folks that are staying home because of the

02:27:43.900 --> 02:27:48.860
whole COVID-19 thing. So they're offering uncharted, the Nathan Drake collection and

02:27:48.860 --> 02:27:54.460
journey for free on PlayStation four, regardless if you have PlayStation plus or not.

02:27:54.460 --> 02:27:57.980
Somebody brought that up in chat and I forgot who I'm sorry. Somebody brought that up in chat

02:27:57.980 --> 02:28:00.860
during the classic game of the week. And I was going to say something when we came back,

02:28:00.860 --> 02:28:05.100
but then my brain was so fixated on F zero. I forgot, but thank you for mentioning that.

02:28:05.340 --> 02:28:11.020
And, and to stress, you do not need PlayStation plus for this. They are like free for all game.

02:28:11.020 --> 02:28:15.100
And of course, everybody was complaining when I, everybody, but people on Twitter who are

02:28:15.100 --> 02:28:19.820
loud and annoying were complaining. Uh, would you already gave us these games? No, no. These

02:28:19.820 --> 02:28:25.980
are free games for everybody. Plus or no plus. So a journey and uncharted collection. And, uh,

02:28:25.980 --> 02:28:33.180
until May 1st. Right. Um, I believe it's until I just closed the page, um, May 5th.

02:28:33.180 --> 02:28:36.220
Okay. Close, but go, go get them now. What are you waiting for? Go get them now.

02:28:36.220 --> 02:28:41.260
Store, store.playsation.com. You can just log in right there at 8 PM Pacific. So,

02:28:41.260 --> 02:28:48.540
you know, get on that. There you go. Is that it? All right. Free, free games is a good note to end

02:28:48.540 --> 02:28:53.420
on a hype. Mayhem would be very proud if he's out there listening. Uh, anyhow, uh, that brings us

02:28:53.420 --> 02:28:56.540
towards the end of the show. I really want to thank you guys for tuning in and listening

02:28:56.540 --> 02:29:00.780
tonight. Really appreciate you guys being here. Uh, whether you were listening live over at Twitch

02:29:00.780 --> 02:29:05.180
TV, where we record on Sunday night, or if you were listening on our podcast feed, which is

02:29:05.180 --> 02:29:10.700
available, of course, on iTunes, Google podcasts, Spotify, pretty much all of the big places where

02:29:10.700 --> 02:29:16.620
you can get podcasts, except for one. Um, you can, uh, listen to this show and leave a nice

02:29:16.620 --> 02:29:20.860
review or something like that. Cause those things go a long way. Tell a friend about the show,

02:29:20.860 --> 02:29:23.820
help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

02:29:23.820 --> 02:29:27.900
but if the voices aren't here to put them out on air, then we don't really get to have every voice

02:29:27.900 --> 02:29:33.980
now, do we? Uh, and, uh, again, for those of you that are on Twitch, an auto host of VOG Network,

02:29:33.980 --> 02:29:37.340
oh my gosh, that's like the absolute best thing you could do. And we really appreciate it.

02:29:37.340 --> 02:29:41.580
We also definitely appreciate all the follows, the biddies and the subs. I will get to those

02:29:41.580 --> 02:29:45.260
after the show, as I always do. If you didn't already see your shout out tickle on the bottom

02:29:45.260 --> 02:29:49.260
of the screen. Uh, but I just want to say an extra special thank you to all of that. Uh, really,

02:29:49.260 --> 02:29:54.380
really do appreciate all of you that go the extra mile. Uh, I think we should now wrap up and start

02:29:54.380 --> 02:29:59.020
to get people's final thoughts. Um, I will start my final thought. I don't usually go first. I'll

02:29:59.020 --> 02:30:03.420
start with my final thought. My final thought tonight is, um, I didn't get into my discussion

02:30:03.420 --> 02:30:08.460
on this because I talked about it enough on Bobby's show tonight, but I will just simply say

02:30:09.340 --> 02:30:16.540
stop spreading articles around that are farming you for hate clicks. Stop sharing hate porn.

02:30:17.420 --> 02:30:23.660
Start sharing nice porn. I don't know a nice way to phrase that, but we'll leave it at that. Okay.

02:30:23.660 --> 02:30:29.340
Stop sharing hate porn. Start sharing just porn. All right. Anyway, uh, Loki, what's your final

02:30:29.340 --> 02:30:34.860
thought tonight? My final thought is I'm hopefully going to work on my game this week. I really tried

02:30:34.860 --> 02:30:43.180
to get to that point. Um, but got very distracted. So I do want to get back into the groove of

02:30:43.180 --> 02:30:48.860
working. It's just, it's been hard because I don't have the routine of going to like my son's coding

02:30:48.940 --> 02:30:53.660
class and sitting down and doing it once in a while. So it's, I need to get back into it.

02:30:53.660 --> 02:30:59.420
And I think even more frequent, like every day if I can. All right. Uh, last but not least,

02:30:59.420 --> 02:31:04.780
the one and only dark soccer. Your final thought. This is more continuous talking than I've done,

02:31:04.780 --> 02:31:10.700
uh, like in a week. And I actually am feeling kind of okay. So I'm actually sitting here

02:31:10.700 --> 02:31:16.220
kind of happy and I have carrot cake waiting for me. Well, I hope you had a wonderful birthday dark

02:31:16.220 --> 02:31:21.100
soccer. And when we can we'll celebrate and I imagine celebration will somehow involve

02:31:21.820 --> 02:31:29.580
liquor, drag queens, cheesecake. Sound good? That sounds pretty epic to me. I'm down. All

02:31:29.580 --> 02:31:33.660
right. Sounds good. Uh, thank you, captain Pikachu for sitting in on cam because Loki

02:31:33.660 --> 02:31:38.780
and dark soccer can't join me in studio. Uh, so, uh, thank you captain Pikachu for being here.

02:31:38.780 --> 02:31:44.860
Uh, hopefully, uh, we'll get beat, get to all be in person, uh, at some point, but we'll do it

02:31:44.860 --> 02:31:48.860
when the governor says it's safe to do it, um, because the governor's listening to scientists

02:31:48.860 --> 02:31:56.780
and, um, scientists are awesome. Uh, stay safe, everybody. Um, you know, again, I know it's been

02:31:56.780 --> 02:32:01.340
going over a month now and people are starting to go a little crazy and like wanting to, but remember

02:32:01.340 --> 02:32:09.500
we're doing this for a reason. Um, stay, stay at home, play video games, pass the time, uh, Zoom,

02:32:09.500 --> 02:32:17.100
Jack box, uh, visit your friends virtually MMOs, animal crossing, whatever it is, uh, hang in there.

02:32:17.100 --> 02:32:21.260
We'll get to the other side of this. Just, you know, you just got to stay put for a little while

02:32:21.260 --> 02:32:25.340
longer. So we'll, uh, we'll stay put and keep doing this show every Sunday for you guys. In

02:32:25.340 --> 02:32:29.900
the meantime, we will see you in seven days next week. I'll finish final fantasy seven

02:32:29.900 --> 02:32:33.660
remake by then. So I'm really hoping I'll have some things to say, have a wonderful week.

02:32:33.660 --> 02:32:40.540
Everybody good night. You've been listening to orange lounge radio. Orange lounge radio is a
