Here's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Tonight we have gaming news of a possibly 35 year old bug, re-examining a 15 year old bug, and PC builders doing their civic duty for today's reality and remake new content

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Stay tuned for the recent articles about old content and news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 815 for this April the 12th of 2020

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Happy Easter out there to those of you that celebrate it

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
To other folks out there, including our very own DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, a very happy bunny day

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No, it's still Passover so Chag Pesach Hasanah to everybody

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Oh yes, there is that still going on as well, I thought that was midweek

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Which ends before my birthday

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Well happy that to you as well

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I get cake for my birthday and it's gonna be a carrot cake with no raisins and I'll be on the show too

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh good, well I mean

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This is next Sunday

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Good and not good, I mean I know you'd probably rather be out at the Cherry Blossom Festival or some of the things you usually do on your birthday weekend

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But it's a weird year, we're doing different things

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah, I mean I haven't gotten to see any cherry blossoms at all this year which is usually like what I live for, you know

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But hey, to my Jew crew listening, Chag Sameach everybody

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And something I've been telling all my friends that have a birthday around this time is that you know

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
At least you completely have justification to get a make up birthday when this is all over

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So we're gonna have a lot of birthdays come July, August, June depending on when we're allowed to gather again, who knows

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Girl, you know what it's gonna be, right?

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We're going to Disneyland

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We're all going the fuck to Disneyland

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I would be so down for that to be quite honest, so yeah

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I don't care how many humans are there, I'll deal, I'll just you know

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't know though, I mean this is probably gonna be a while, it's probably not gonna be until next year

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I mean being logical about it, they're saying you know 18 months at minimum before you know a vaccine is out and kicked in and spread amongst enough people to be effective

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Right, well we'll see

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We'll play it safe and play it smart

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You know we'll listen to the scientists, you know I think yeah

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Running and going to Disneyland will probably not be the first thing because Disneyland's gonna be one of the last things to kind of come back

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Just like you know I've got my eye on Dragon Con and I'm hopeful that Dragon Con will still happen

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm hopeful that testing and all that stuff will be at a good enough place, they can do contact tracing and all that stuff

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But if the scientists say don't do it, then it is what it is

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You know we're gonna listen to science and make our educated decisions that way

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I haven't heard anything on DerpyCon either so I mean that's not until the end of October

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But certainly next year since I'm not doing, I'm not gonna do Dragon Con anymore because I'll be perfectly honest

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
They've kind of done one of the groups that I'm in a little bit dirty and on top of that I don't want to support

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I mean it's enough that I watch the show and I'll leave it that way, I'm not gonna support someone who does fracking and has been such a shit to other people

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So I am probably gonna do Dragon Con next year

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Don't say it if you don't mean it, don't say it if you don't mean it

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I need to talk to you about you know what the situation for us going and you know panels and crap but just we'll talk

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Between Bobby and I we'll make it work, we'll make it work but yeah don't say it if you don't mean it because you're gonna get my hopes up

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll put it this way, I do absolutely mean it and I will do whatever is in my power to make it happen

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Besides that, I have been contemplating some epic cosplays for next year

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
There you go, there you go, alright

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Including a character I'm probably way too short to portray but hey I really like Zaki

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Well somebody else I'd like to get that kind of commitment from, say hello to Techmaster Loki

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah, Loki

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And Loki might be on mute, hello?

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm sorry my key binds aren't working

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Oh that's okay

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It wasn't working for a second because I was typing in chat

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Alright well, oh okay, well you're multitasking, that's fine

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And you're reminding us that we do have a live chat room because we do tape live

59
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Twitch.tv slash VOG Network, V-O-G Network

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You can also visit us on the web at VOGNetwork.com because we have a lot of friendly podcasts that we're in this network with

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
A lot of awesome shows that, you know, not only things we host here at VOG Network on Twitch, things like Girls Gone Wow and Anime Jam Session

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But the interesting, not that this quarantine situation is a good thing at all

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But if you want to look for the diamonds in the rough, shall we say

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Some of our podcasts that have gone on hiatus, you know, just because life gets in the way sometimes

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Have found the time to record again

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So The Geek Card just put out a new episode this last week

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And I'm told another one is coming

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I don't know if I'm allowed to say what yet, but they're in chat probably so maybe they'll say something

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But yeah, so that's, you know, not the way I want shows to come back

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But you know, hey, if it's like the one piece of good news in this situation then I will stink and take it

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Anyway, so Loki, one of these years we gotta get you to Dragon Con as well

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I mean, it probably won't be until the kids are 18, but we'll hope for it

74
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah, well I would have said, yeah, definitely

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
How has your week been personally? I know usually you do family stuff today

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So I know things have kind of changed this year, but were you able to take the kids out to a park to do

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Have a good dinner or anything like that?

78
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No, we just, well we had kids this morning

79
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
They looked for them in our house, so we did that

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And then we went out to the park just to ride, they rode their bikes and stuff

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But like, I mean I cook all week, so like, you know, I made my

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
My honey butter chicken that stuff is like cracked, so

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That's right, you talked about that last week, that's awesome

84
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I made that yesterday, yes, I bought four pounds worth of wings and I made all of them in the house

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So good

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I love it

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Alright, yeah, it's interesting how this

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You're going to leave some on my doorstep, right?

89
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
There's not going to be any left

90
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's interesting how this situation has led people to doing more cooking

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Alan cooked this morning, he made some lemon poppy seed muffins, they were really good

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So he doesn't always do stuff like that, so it's cool

93
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm making bread with passovers over, but I decided I think tomorrow night, I'm going to try my hand at matzah

94
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Mmm, yum yum, matzah is penance

95
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So yeah, lots of food to eat while we're playing lots of games

96
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And I know there's been lots of game playing amongst the crew this week

97
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We'll get into that in a bit, but we like to start usually with a kickoff topic

98
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So this week's kickoff topic has to do with Nintendo Switch

99
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Which has, you know, is already probably the most popular console out there

100
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I think that would be a fair statement to make right now

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Especially because we know PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are kind of on the, you know, they're on their way out the door

102
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,000
As we know, PlayStation 5 and Xbox, I keep wanting to call it the XX, but Xbox Series X are on their way in the door

103
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Just go with your instincts

104
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That's right, go with what you know

105
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So the Switch is probably really the king of the hill right now

106
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Especially when you consider things like Animal Crossing is just like, it's become like this pop culture icon amongst this situation

107
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It has proven to be like the ultimate form of escapism

108
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So, so many people want to get their hands on a Switch

109
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And it's actually come to the point where the Switch supply is really low

110
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And like let's be real, Nintendo isn't the greatest when it comes to hardware demand and all that stuff anyway

111
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And this situation, you know, I'm not trying to make light of the situation

112
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But this situation just isn't helping what's already usually a rough ride for Nintendo

113
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What I mean by that, Nintendo announced this week that they suspended shipments of, excuse me

114
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Can't do anything about that, sneeze is live on air

115
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Nintendo suspended shipments of the Nintendo Switch system in Japan

116
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
This is only a temporary thing because if you're not aware, the COVID-19 situation is increasing in Japan

117
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We're probably a couple weeks behind where we've been at in regards to, you know, how it's spreading through the population and so forth

118
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So this is just a temporary move, Nintendo says

119
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But it does mean that devices are not shipping outside of reservations

120
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
They don't know when shipments will resume

121
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
They are saying that this move does not affect consumers in Europe and North America

122
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But I feel like that just can't be true

123
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And I don't know if that maybe goes all the way back to when China has been going through some of these things

124
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And the factory and the productions there were kind of seeing the trickle down effects

125
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But I know people that are trying to get their hands on a Nintendo Switch

126
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And it really isn't the easiest thing to do right now

127
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
To give you an idea of the situation in Japan

128
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The Switch stock is so low that retailers are starting to do lotteries

129
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So a Japanese store named Yamada Denke put up a lottery to potentially buy 130 Switch consoles

130
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And 900 copies of Ring Fit Adventure

131
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Which is another really hard thing to find right now

132
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Probably because it involves hardware

133
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It has that little ring that goes with it, that resistance band

134
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And so it probably limits the number of those that Nintendo can put out

135
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
200,000 people entered the lottery

136
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
199,000 of them flippers

137
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
No, I'm just kidding

138
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But I'm also probably not sadly

139
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
But 200,000 people entered the lottery

140
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That is for one retailer

141
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So yeah, Nintendo is trying to ship more units

142
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But that gives you an idea how crazy the supply and the demand is right there right now in Japan

143
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So what is it about the Nintendo Switch that is driving people crazy for it

144
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I can tell you

145
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Let me come to you, Dark Sakura, for your opinion

146
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
But I just want to say, especially now in this quarantine COVID situation

147
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
These sorts of things we expect to hear around the holidays, around the launch

148
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But we're not talking the launch period

149
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This is like two years into the system's life now

150
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Dark Sakura, what's your thoughts?

151
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Animal Crossing

152
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What is it about Animal Crossing?

153
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Well, and I'm looking at it sort of as my two years of psychology before I changed my major type stuff

154
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The issue is that right now a lot of stuff is out of control, right?

155
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
We don't have a lot of active control over what we can do in our lives

156
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
We can't go out, we can't do things

157
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
We can't see the people that we want to see

158
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But Animal Crossing has been this way to remotely visit people

159
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I mean, for me, I've been hanging out with my friend Gwen practically every day

160
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
We were college roommates and haven't seen each other since a couple of years since I moved out here

161
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But we chat every day

162
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
She used to be in our WoW guild for a while

163
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You remember? She's actually on Final Fantasy XIV right now

164
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yeah, I know she is, yeah

165
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So anyway, I've been playing with Tiara

166
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
They've been really good company

167
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I can do stuff in my town

168
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's something that I have a more active control over

169
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Something that I am doing, something that's giving me that immediate reward

170
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And on top of that, now some people have been absolutely cutthroat with the game

171
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But it's been a lot of people cooperating with each other

172
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's taking that stuff that we're trying to encourage people to do in real life

173
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But we have this controllable environment that kind of does let us be in the presence of other people to interact

174
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yeah, that's a very interesting take

175
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And I like that, the fact that even though in this situation you can't control things

176
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
In Animal Crossing, relatively, you have control over things

177
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I mean, maybe not everything

178
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The other day, Rocket threatened to move out of my town

179
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And I basically said she's not allowed to do that

180
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And if she leaves, I'm going to burn down the town

181
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But she didn't, so I'm very happy about that

182
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Because Rocket and Ketchup are my two favorite villagers, just for the record

183
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I especially love Ketchup, I will die for Ketchup

184
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Octavian is pissing me off because I invited him for a second time

185
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Because he's my favorite grumpy old man octopus

186
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So now I have to invite him a third time to try to convince him

187
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I gave up on Dina

188
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Dina, I think, has moved on to other levels of her lesbianism

189
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'll tell you what, Brad, Pod Culture and Chats says, how do we send Ed to Jamie?

190
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You shut your whore mouth, okay?

191
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:37,000
As the island turns, like bells through the hourglass, these are the days of our horizons

192
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But you know what I did find amongst my amiibo cards?

193
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I found Julian

194
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yeah, no, you had a crap ton of those amiibo cards

195
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And I have the actual figurines

196
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Do you know what I actually have that now apparently is really valuable?

197
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I have a sealed copy of Wii U Animal Crossing with the Isabelle amiibo and the other guy in it, still, sealed

198
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh, what you mean the amiibo festival?

199
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The little dog, yeah, amiibo festival, that's it

200
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Those are going for like hundreds of dollars on eBay

201
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I have the game, although I've played it because I actually think it's legit fun

202
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yeah, no, I never opened it and I was thinking about opening it the other day

203
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Because this is the hilarious part, Alan got it for like 10 bucks on a Target clearance

204
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Because that was one of the last games in the heyday of the Wii U

205
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So that was kind of on its way out the door

206
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And now everybody wants their hands on those amiibo

207
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And Wii U games in general are becoming collector's items

208
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I don't know, I don't know if I want to keep it, sell it, what do I want to do? It's tough

209
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Well, I'll tell you what, nothing has financial value until you try to sell it

210
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I guess that's true

211
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Anyway, I want to get some of the comments from our chat room over at Twitch

212
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And then good fucking luck

213
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Over at twitch.tv slash vog network because a lot of folks have some comments on this

214
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So Mel Chan in our chat says

215
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I have mine but I've been trying to find one for my client to keep her busy

216
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm assuming this is a switch

217
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Between tons of families suddenly stuck at home and the biggest game for it in a long time happening simultaneously

218
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It just added to it

219
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Let's see, Fifth Dream Today says

220
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Someone I know from the Goth community I'm in and barely knew since Animal Crossing New Horizons came out

221
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
We've been talking and trading and having conversations about other things

222
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Well, you know, sometimes video games really do bring us together

223
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And for me it's always been about MMOs

224
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Like some of my closest friendships were formed because of MMOs

225
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And being able to play MMOs online with people

226
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I mean, hell, even like Loki and I before we lived together we were playing Final Fantasy XI a lot online

227
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So, you know, a lot of times video games can definitely bring us together

228
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And although I wouldn't call Animal Crossing New Horizons an MMO per se

229
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
There definitely is an important multiplayer component about it, for sure

230
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
YYR says it was definitely the Animal Crossing New Horizons release above all

231
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Also, despite Nintendo's selection of multiplayer games, you need multiple systems to really take advantage

232
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So a lot of thoughts there on the Nintendo Switch shortage

233
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And then when it comes to Ring Fit Adventure, SHG100Matt says

234
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I've been playing a ton of Ring Fit Adventure

235
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's the best thing to keep me active without going outside

236
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Which I do at midnight when no one is around

237
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
But Ring Fit Adventure offers a great workout

238
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And yeah, I think that game in particular

239
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You know, that game was getting kind of hard to find anyway

240
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And you hit the nail on the head

241
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Like some people, like I do go outdoors once in a while

242
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And I go to parks and I still play my GPS games like Orna and Ingress and stuff

243
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But I find that I'm going to the same parks and the same places

244
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And it's getting a little dry for me

245
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So Ring Fit Adventure is something a little bit kind of like different I think

246
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You know, you're working your way, it's digitally different but it's still something different

247
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And then of course they added that music game mode

248
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Right after the last direct

249
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
That kind of added something to it as well

250
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So I think Ring Fit Adventure feels a lot different than taking a walk around that same neighborhood park

251
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You've taken a trip around many, many times before

252
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So yeah, SHG100Matt says

253
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Folks can't go to the gym, Ring Fit offers a great alternative

254
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Loki, let me go to you

255
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
What do you think is the Switch fever?

256
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
What is it that's making everybody crave one of these right now?

257
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Because they can't have it so then they want it

258
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I don't know, I think it's just

259
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's popular, I don't see Animal Crossing as a system seller but

260
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I don't know

261
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I really would think it would be a different game or something like that

262
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But I don't know

263
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I don't know what the

264
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I think people finding maybe more time to play games now

265
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And so they decided that they want to get Switch

266
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Maybe we're hearing more about the Switch because

267
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Xbox and Playstation 4 are so easy to get

268
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And I would normally agree with you that

269
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Animal Crossing I would not have thought would have been a game that would be a system seller

270
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
In any other, that doesn't mean it's a bad game

271
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I just wouldn't have seen it as something that moved

272
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I mean there's always going to be the hardcore fans

273
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But I would have seen it as something that moved a lot of systems in any other circumstance

274
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
But in this particular world circumstance now I'm like

275
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Oh it kind of is though

276
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Yeah and I don't even know necessarily it's just because Animal Crossing came

277
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I mean I think it's just the timing in general

278
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And I think it's because Nintendo has historically had a poor

279
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
They've done a poor job at fulfilling orders for their systems

280
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And yeah I know they're blaming it on the COVID stuff now

281
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
But let's be honest I mean they're going to blame it on everything

282
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I just don't

283
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It'd be interesting to see like the actual numbers of how many systems have been sold

284
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I mean I know Nintendo does well and I'm not just going to say that

285
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I don't think it's dramatically different

286
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I just think that because now everybody's

287
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
The demand has gone up that now they're having supply issues again

288
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Whereas I'm not sure

289
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I assume that the demand's gone up across the board for all systems

290
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
But I think that they're able to handle their supply a little bit better maybe

291
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I don't know

292
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
But I'd be curious to see how the other systems fare as well

293
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah I think Animal Crossing 2 is very different from a Zelda

294
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Very different from a Mario Party or Mario Kart

295
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
That's already on the Switch

296
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Because I think Animal Crossing is a game where you know

297
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
As Dark Sakura was kind of explaining with her old roommate

298
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You can kind of get together and do things in a space

299
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Whereas you know that's not really what you're doing in Mario Kart

300
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I mean yes you can play that game online with friends or Splatoon even

301
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I mean that doesn't make those games bad at all

302
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
They're great for what they are

303
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
But they're not like existing in the same space

304
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And building this space together that's almost like

305
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Fulfilling this need that many of us are not getting in the real world right now

306
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's something very specific about that game

307
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
In many ways Nintendo could not have timed it any better

308
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And I know that sounds like a really crass thing to say

309
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And nobody would have ever wished this situation on anything

310
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But it's just how the pieces fell for this particular game and this circumstance

311
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And it's really worked out in this game's favor

312
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It is what it is

313
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I sound like a horrible person when I'm saying it that way

314
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
But that's just the reality

315
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You don't sound horrible at all though

316
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That sounds absolutely accurate

317
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I mean not that they purposefully timed it like this

318
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
But the timing was perfect

319
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
No one knew that there was going to be a pandemic

320
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
But the fact that this came out just at the right time

321
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Has been a godsend for a lot of people's sanity

322
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Yeah in many ways

323
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And it's interesting as Bobby points out

324
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
They did delay it

325
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It was a November game last year

326
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And in many ways

327
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I can't believe here we are now saying this

328
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
But thank god they delayed it

329
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Right?

330
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And I'm hoping

331
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I know that there's another company that's hoping

332
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
To get the same kind of fire lit under their game

333
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Because it's come out a while ago

334
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And hasn't done very well

335
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
But now they're releasing it on Steam

336
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And that's Fallout 76

337
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's finally coming to Steam

338
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
But

339
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's Fallout 76

340
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Yeah

341
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Number one it's Fallout 76

342
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And I feel like most people have already made their judgement on that

343
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I mean good luck to them

344
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Well they have the Wastelanders expansion

345
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And not to say they can never be good at some point

346
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It's just

347
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm gonna send my thoughts and prayers to Fallout 76

348
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
But the reality is

349
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
What it doesn't have that Animal Crossing has

350
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I think is a sense of accessibility

351
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And by that I mean like

352
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Kids play Animal Crossing

353
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's very easy for adults

354
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
We have the famous grandma that plays Animal Crossing

355
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And it's not that these folks can't play Fallout 76

356
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Although I don't know if you know with the violence in that game

357
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It may be appropriate for audiences

358
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
But it's just something about the accessibility

359
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Of an Animal Crossing game versus a Fallout 76

360
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Where it's like

361
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Fallout 76 you'll never be glamour

362
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Like you'll never be glamour Fallout

363
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You never will

364
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Animal Crossing has

365
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
That it factor

366
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That X factor

367
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
That accessibility

368
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That universal appeal thing

369
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
That like

370
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm sorry Bethesda

371
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
But Fallout 76 doesn't have it

372
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Now for a certain audience

373
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
And a certain group

374
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And certain people

375
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
That will you know turn their nose up at Animal Crossing

376
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And yes Fallout 76 will play to that audience

377
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
But the reality is it's not as big of an audience

378
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
So there's

379
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Yeah I figured as much yeah

380
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Yeah

381
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Well and I've got Dan back into playing Animal Crossing

382
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Which he had no interest in since

383
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You know the GameCube one

384
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Where you had all your NES games in there

385
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And he and I have been

386
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I've been though

387
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Whoring him out to you know pay off all of my

388
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You know bridges and inclines and stuff

389
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
By making his own tarantula island

390
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
But for him I think he's

391
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Found some things in it very therapeutic

392
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
So it's brought people back into that

393
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
That fandom too

394
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And the fan art community has been a delight

395
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I am all about the stock market

396
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I am all about

397
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Stonks

398
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The stonks

399
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Turnips

400
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I heard you like turnips

401
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Because I am that person that like

402
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I have a little group chat with like

403
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Shane and some of the other people

404
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I play Fallout SE 14

405
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And like just before noon in the AM

406
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I have this picture of Tom Nook holding a gun

407
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It's like it's the gun meme where somebody's holding a gun to the camera

408
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And it's Tom Nook holding a gun

409
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It says give me your turnip prices

410
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Because I'm trying to find where I can sell those turnips

411
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And right now I have a turnip room in my house

412
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And it's only barely enough to hold all the turnips right now

413
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So everybody kind of has their different way of playing

414
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I don't like to do the tarantula game

415
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
But everybody has their different way of doing it

416
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
For me it's all about turnips

417
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
About turnips for one reason

418
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
To get ants

419
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Because that's how you get ants is you have to leave your turnips out

420
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And the ants are cute

421
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
But then Dan took my ants and I went back and the ants were gone

422
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And I was so mad

423
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And Sia Tabiri says

424
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I finally got into turnips this morning

425
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Yeah and that's

426
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I love like talking to people going to the different groups

427
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
What's your turnips, what's your turnips, what's your

428
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Hey I heard you like turnips

429
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
But what I don't like

430
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And I'm gonna be downright honest

431
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
What I don't care for is like

432
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I read this article about how somebody set up

433
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
A security team on their island

434
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
That would block the door to nooks

435
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Until you like left a tip

436
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
That you'd I guess promise to give

437
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
All this like crazy stuff

438
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And I'm like that ain't it

439
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
For me I mean if that's how you want to play

440
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Hey it's your game do what you like

441
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
But for me like I don't believe in tipping

442
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
In Animal Crossing

443
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
In the real world completely different

444
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
But in Animal Crossing no no no

445
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
It's about the exchange of

446
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You know you scratch my back I'll scratch yours

447
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
And I had

448
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And this person has friends

449
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
What society should be like in Animal Crossing

450
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You know what Bernie Sanders

451
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Bernie Sanders ran on a turnip platform

452
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And look what happened

453
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Alright anyway

454
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
But I will say this

455
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
You know I've started a Facebook Animal Crossing group

456
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
That grew much bigger than I thought it was gonna be

457
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
But everybody there

458
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I have to give them credit

459
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Everyone there has been a delight

460
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Everyone has put out public codes for everyone

461
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And these are the kind of people that I like to play with

462
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And I encourage everyone just to be

463
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
You know don't make it a burden for other people

464
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Help each other out you know

465
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And then play that into real life please

466
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
We need it

467
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Yeah for sure

468
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Yeah and like when my turnips were going for 90

469
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Like they were selling last week at 90

470
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I was just like yeah open up come visit

471
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Cause then I was like yay people will visit

472
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And if they write on my board

473
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Or they talk to my villagers

474
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And that's reward enough for me

475
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
So but I understand some people have a more capitalistic approach

476
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
To things

477
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Gosh maybe I was a democratic socialist this whole time

478
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And didn't realize I don't know

479
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I'll throw something out there too Rob

480
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Because you know and not

481
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
People I guess just don't actually realize this

482
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
But if you've held something in your inventory

483
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
You can order it later as long as it was a DIY

484
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
So that's what Gwen and I have been doing every day

485
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Is that we'll find something we're not sure if the other person has

486
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And we order each other our music

487
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Well I did that for you

488
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You needed the meme shirt

489
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Yeah we did

490
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Yeah so I sent you the meme shirt

491
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And then I immediately took it over to Gwen

492
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
So she could put it in her inventory for five seconds

493
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And I could get it back

494
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm all about that that's cool

495
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And so that way we've been you know

496
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
If someone wants something

497
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Yeah maybe you can't pay the 64,000 bells for an arcade machine

498
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
But you can hold it for five seconds

499
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And save up for one for yourself

500
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
But I will say this and I think we're starting to bleed into our

501
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Video game weeks a little bit

502
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So I'll advance the ticket over here

503
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
But I will say this much

504
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
As far as like all that stuff goes

505
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Is that I don't really open my island to everybody

506
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Because and I think one of the big drawbacks about Animal Crossing is

507
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Surprise surprise Nintendo's mediocre online system

508
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Because it takes like freaking two minutes

509
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
For somebody to get to your island

510
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And another two minutes for them to leave

511
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And that can be like let's imagine

512
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Just imagine my turnips are selling for 530

513
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
One day just imagine

514
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And I go to Twitter and I write

515
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Hey my island's open

516
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
My turnips are 530

517
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
People are never gonna get in

518
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Because every 30 seconds

519
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Bing bing bing

520
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Please close the window

521
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
A person's trying to connect

522
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And it would just be crazy

523
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
That's why I only open my island with dodo codes

524
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So that I know who's coming

525
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I have it controlled to a certain number

526
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And then like I don't have to worry about that

527
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Connecting and disconnecting message every 30 seconds

528
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
It is the most annoying thing they need to fix

529
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Big time

530
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat talking about his experience with Animal Crossing

531
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Saying the fun part with me

532
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Is that my wife is playing more than I do

533
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And we have one physical cart

534
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
So we can't play at the same time

535
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
She's unemployed so she's playing a lot

536
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And I get like an hour or two a night before my shop's closed

537
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Well we all play at our different pace

538
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Like Dark Soccer came to visit me this week

539
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
At Animal Crossing

540
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And she's like, where's your Able Sisters?

541
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And I'm like, don't have it

542
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I've been doing things at my pace

543
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I'm like, I think I still need to build somebody a home

544
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I don't know

545
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And she was like, oh

546
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
My kids use it for Minecraft

547
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
And so I never get it

548
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Yeah but it's just, I've been playing 14 and near

549
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And 7 Remake and other stuff I'll talk about shortly

550
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So it's like, I've just been playing Animal Crossing at my own pace

551
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And like I said, I'm all about the turnips

552
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I want to have my basement

553
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Because if Dark Soccer isn't going to have a shrine to fire

554
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Then I will, in my basement

555
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
No, I have my bonfire

556
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Once I finish getting my townhouse planned up

557
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I'm going to be, well I've got my Stonehenge right?

558
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And I'm going to put fire all around my Stonehenge

559
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
With my cherry trees in the background

560
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And we also don't have any bridges or anything leading to it

561
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So my animals can't go, you know, mess it up

562
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So, yeah

563
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And I have Baphomet Point, don't forget about that

564
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Where my lighthouse is

565
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
That's right

566
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
You know, and to be fair

567
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I also kind of want like a

568
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I don't know if I want to say a sex dungeon in the basement

569
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
But like a pervert dungeon

570
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I think is what I want in the basement of my house

571
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
So, you know, I'll be thinking about that

572
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Because I'm that sicko that likes to do things you really shouldn't do in cutesy games

573
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
What can I say?

574
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Should I order you the bondage outfit then that they have in the game?

575
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Oh, do they have one? Yes

576
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Because today I got that

577
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I got that human skeleton that like you could

578
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
It's like the anatomy thing

579
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Yeah

580
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Yeah, I thought that would be funny

581
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Do you need like the actual skeleton?

582
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
You know, if you poke at it, it raises its arms like it's trying to scare you

583
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Oh yeah, I knew one of those, send me one of those

584
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Okay, I can order tomorrow, so yeah

585
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
We'll talk about that later, but I'll send you the bondage outfit too

586
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Let's talk about the rest of our gaming weeks

587
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I mean, clearly Animal Crossing has played a big part in our weeks

588
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Just like everybody else's

589
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
DarkSakura, would you care to continue?

590
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
How was your gaming week? Animal Crossing or otherwise?

591
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Animal Crossing

592
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
All the Animal Crossing

593
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And actually, my lungs have been doing a lot better

594
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Yay

595
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So I've actually considered getting Yoga Master for the Switch

596
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Just to give myself a little bit more motivation to get up and do my morning yoga

597
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
So, you know, I'm not all stiff and terrible

598
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And hopefully do that to, you know, get my breathing back where it was

599
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
You know, like I said, it's better

600
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
But I moved like three bags of dirt that I got at Target

601
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Because, you know, I'm planting my apocalypse garden

602
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And, oh, I was a mess right after that

603
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
So yeah, I'm hoping that having like a yoga game on my Switch

604
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Will, you know, help me get back into doing my breathing exercises and all that

605
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Kind of sounds like it's trying to hit on that Wii Fit market

606
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
That doesn't totally exist on the Switch right now

607
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Although, I mean, there's Ring Fit certainly

608
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
But Ring Fit doesn't really have a yoga in it

609
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
So, which was probably the most popular and well-known element of Wii Fit

610
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
If we got a Wii Fit, though, that would be absolutely amazing

611
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Because I think I would play the hell out of it

612
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
You know, again, just because of not being able to get up

613
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
You know, I've got free weights in the house that I could be using

614
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
But while I'm healing up and my lungs aren't as strong

615
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Doing yoga and certainly, you know, doing it in a game

616
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Would probably be easier and more enjoyable

617
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Alright, anything else with your gaming week?

618
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I, no

619
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Alright, then we'll go to Loki

620
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
How was your gaming week?

621
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So, this week I didn't play a ton of things

622
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I did end up playing some Final Fantasy VII Remake

623
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
So, I'm not very far in it

624
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I'm about just an hour and a half or so into it

625
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
So, I think just in the middle of Chapter 2

626
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And I'm liking it so far

627
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I think it's pretty amazing

628
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Just an incredible looking game

629
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And I remember Nelly was going

630
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Like, is this a game?

631
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
She's like, it looks so real

632
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
But yeah, it was fun

633
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I tried to get my kids to watch because I thought it'd be interesting for them to watch

634
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
But they only had the attention span for like five minutes

635
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
But, what else?

636
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I also played a little bit more Beat Saber

637
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I did a little bit of Step Mania

638
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I've been going through my song list

639
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And trying to pare down some of the songs I have on there

640
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And try to remove duplicates that I have in folders

641
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Because I just dumped a whole bunch of collections together

642
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
So, I've been going through that

643
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And also, I repaired my Nintendo Switch this week

644
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
So, I had Drift on the two Joy-Cons

645
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
So, I actually got the parts from iFixit

646
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And took them apart

647
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
The Joy-Cons replaced the analog sticks in them

648
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And then I was having an issue where I kept saying my SD card was being removed from the system

649
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Even though it wasn't

650
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
So, I took the system apart

651
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And the way they engineered that thing is so stupid

652
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It's literally being held in by a little bit of foam

653
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,000
And the tension from the actual back of the device is pushing this connection down

654
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And so, it can come loose if your child then drops it on the ground

655
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So, literally all I had to do was push it back in the connector

656
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And then everything was fine

657
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
But the fact that it's not like held in

658
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
It's not like a ribbon cable or something that's attached in there

659
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
It's just like this little thing that's held on by pressure

660
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
It's absolutely stupid

661
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
At least I know if it ever breaks it's easier to replace

662
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
So, I did all that this week

663
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
And then I've been just kind of getting my laptop still set up for gaming and stuff

664
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I got an external drive reader for my 5TB drive from my old laptop

665
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I tried fixing my old one but I think it's shot

666
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And then I got a brand new 2TB one

667
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
So, I got like 8TB of storage on my PC now

668
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
It's great

669
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I'm putting tons of games on there

670
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So, that's been my week

671
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Okay, awesome

672
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Well, enjoy filling up the 8TB drive with games you'll never play

673
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Absolutely

674
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Okay

675
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
My gaming week

676
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Let's talk about Final Fantasy VII Remake

677
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Because I'm also playing it

678
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And I'm on chapter 6

679
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
We have it on order by the way

680
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Well, here's the thing

681
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
So, I was supposed to get it on Tuesday

682
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Because Amazon's running behind

683
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I get a lot of my stuff from Amazon

684
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And they're running a little behind

685
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And I really was okay with it

686
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
But then when everybody was getting the hype going on Twitter

687
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
And all that stuff

688
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And I was thinking about

689
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I don't really have a lot to do this weekend

690
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I was like, you know what?

691
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Fuck it

692
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I'm just gonna buy it digital

693
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Even though, yeah

694
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
So, I did it

695
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I hit the button and I bought digital

696
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And I'm actually kind of glad I did

697
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Because it's been able to fill quite a bit of time this weekend

698
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Maybe about like 7 hours in

699
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I don't know

700
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I'd probably play more if I had a better attention span

701
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
But I'm very much like

702
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I sit in front of the TV for an hour

703
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Then I need to go sit in front of the computer for an hour

704
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And then maybe I need to go like

705
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Go in the backyard for just a little bit

706
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
To get some fresh air or something

707
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Like, I can't really just keep staying in one place

708
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
For hours and hours and hours

709
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Like I used to be able to

710
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
When the original Final Fantasy VII came out

711
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
But anyway, I have played through a good chunk of the game at this point

712
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I mean, I don't know how many chapters there are

713
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
But I'm up to chapter 6

714
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Obviously, I'm not gonna spoil anything

715
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Let's talk about that to begin with

716
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Because you might think

717
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Well, Rob, how can you spoil things

718
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Because this is just a remake of Final Fantasy VII

719
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
So it's the same plot, right?

720
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Wrong

721
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
There are a lot of things

722
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
That people are getting very wrong about this game

723
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And I'm going right for it

724
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
One of them

725
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
That you guys are getting really wrong

726
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And when I say like you guys

727
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I mean like Twitter

728
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And some of the, you know, hot takes, trademarks

729
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
So forth about the game

730
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Is the hot take that I see

731
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I do not want to buy that game

732
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Because it's only 10% of the story

733
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
You are completely going about that assessment the wrong way

734
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Period

735
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It is not a one for one remake

736
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
You're thinking probably of a remaster

737
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
You're thinking of that game that you wanted

738
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
When you saw that PlayStation 3 demo

739
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
That rendered the opening sequence of the game in high definition

740
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
All those years ago

741
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
That first led people to talking about

742
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
They wanted a Final Fantasy VII in HD

743
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Let me be clear

744
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
This is not that game

745
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
This is a different game

746
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
And I think maybe part of the problem

747
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Is that they called it Final Fantasy VII Remake

748
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Because this is Final Fantasy Reimagined

749
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
This is Final Fantasy VII Reinvention

750
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
This is

751
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
They took the plot and they took the characters

752
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And they made a brand new game out

753
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
They made Final Fantasy XVI out of it

754
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Is what they did

755
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
This is what should have been

756
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Well in a way

757
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
But you couldn't do this game on the PlayStation

758
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Full stop

759
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
As long as that bitch dies

760
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
As long as there are guys I'm happy

761
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Well and who knows

762
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And I don't think that part would be covered in this game

763
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
But I really feel like anything goes with the plot

764
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I have her

765
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Obviously I want this to be a spoiler free place

766
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I have heard the ending is shocking

767
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Which it shouldn't be shocking

768
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
If you've played through the original

769
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So apparently they've done something

770
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
But it wouldn't surprise me

771
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Because they have done all this different stuff along the way

772
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
One of the things is that they have completely fleshed out these characters

773
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Who were very much

774
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I don't want to say throwaway sidekicks

775
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
But they were just

776
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
They were not really a part of the story before

777
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I'm speaking mainly of Jesse, Biggs, and Wedge

778
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Who are completely fleshed out full characters

779
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
They're not playable

780
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
But I'll be damned if you're going to tell me they're not a part of the story

781
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Because they very much are in this game

782
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
And you know

783
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Again this is not a one for one of the original Final Fantasy VII

784
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
What this is

785
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Think of it more like this

786
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And I can't think of a better comparison

787
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Maybe you guys can

788
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Final Fantasy VII is like Buffy the Vampire Slayer the movie

789
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
A nice two hour movie

790
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Stands on its own

791
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
There's things people appreciate about it

792
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Everybody loves that sequence with Pee Wee Herman as the vampire

793
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
There's Buffy the Vampire Slayer the movie

794
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Then years later

795
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
There's Buffy the Vampire Slayer the TV show

796
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
It goes on for seven seasons

797
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
You know what it's the same character

798
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
And some of the themes they explore are the exact same thing

799
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
But it's very very different

800
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
That is Final Fantasy VII Remake

801
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I don't know what do you guys think

802
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Is that a fair comparison?

803
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Anyone?

804
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I haven't watched the Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie

805
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Now you spoil it for me

806
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
You need to fix that

807
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I can see that

808
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I can see that except

809
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
No cause

810
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I don't know

811
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Maybe not directly that

812
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Because yeah the plot of the movie doesn't really go over to the TV show

813
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
But I couldn't really think of a movie

814
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
The only other thing I can think of is that The Shining was a movie

815
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And then they had the mini series

816
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
With Rebecca De Mornay and some other guy

817
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
What about more like V?

818
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Oh that's a good one

819
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
We had V the mini series

820
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And then it tried to flesh it out

821
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I'm gonna tell you the TV series kind of jumped the shark a bit later

822
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
But I can kind of see what the TV series was trying to do

823
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Oh MASH

824
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Good one Pod Culture

825
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I don't know if as many people know about

826
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I hate to say it but know about MASH

827
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Let's be real

828
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
The 20 year olds may not

829
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
May not have familiarity with MASH

830
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Like those of us in our 40's

831
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
When the reruns were on all day long

832
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
But MASH is a good

833
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
If you know MASH that's an excellent example actually

834
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
So anyway

835
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I think you all kind of get what I'm saying

836
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says

837
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Game Spots Review had the best line

838
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
For returning fans this isn't the Final Fantasy 7 your mind remembers

839
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
It's the one your heart always knew it to be

840
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Tigerclaw says

841
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Is the story in the Final Fantasy 7 remake

842
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Verbatim from the original

843
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
All the same story beats and stuff that made the original impactful

844
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
No

845
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
And I'll leave it at that

846
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
So

847
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Tigerclaw says

848
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Remakes often do things different from the original

849
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Stuff like origins of characters being different

850
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
The fate of certain characters being different

851
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
It's how they differentiate from the original

852
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And I will say

853
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
And again I don't want to spoil

854
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Because I want to be very

855
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
You know very aware that maybe not everybody

856
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Some of you probably ordered from Amazon

857
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Haven't got the game yet

858
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
But if you've played the demo

859
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Which is available out there for everybody

860
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
You'll notice that the end of the demo

861
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Is something very very explicit

862
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
That was only

863
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Implied in the original game

864
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
And wasn't necessarily

865
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Explicitly stated

866
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
The way it was very clearly done

867
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
At the end of the demo

868
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
For those that have played it you'll know exactly what I'm talking about

869
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
For those that haven't, well maybe that will make you interested

870
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I don't know

871
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
But I kind of think playing that demo will give you a good sense

872
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Of the types of changes they can make to the game

873
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
For one it will give you a feeling of the combat

874
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Which the combat is

875
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Very different and not everybody's going to love it

876
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Again

877
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I know a lot of people are like

878
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Oh there's a classic mode

879
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
It's really nothing like the original battle system

880
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I'm sorry to say

881
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I don't know I kind of think it's fun

882
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I like the new battle system

883
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I'm playing it on easy, granted

884
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Because I really wanted to focus on the story

885
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
And I kind of felt okay I'll do one play through on easy

886
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
And in the back of my mind I'm going

887
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
This game's going to come out on Playstation 5

888
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Oh that was the other reason I went digital

889
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
At the end of the day

890
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I went digital because my thought was

891
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
If Playstation 5 will play Playstation 4 games

892
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Then hypothetically

893
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Fingers crossed, toes crossed

894
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
We don't know this for sure

895
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
But I'm hoping Sony does the right thing

896
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
And that means your digital library on Playstation 4

897
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Will instantly unlock on Playstation 5

898
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Probably

899
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
That's my hope anyway

900
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I hope Sony gets that right

901
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
So my thought is

902
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I'm going to play through it on easy now

903
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
And if I have to replay it on Playstation 5

904
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I'll play it on either normal or hard then

905
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
So that's kind of my other thought

906
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Process that went to that

907
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
But I think the battle mode is

908
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Kind of fun

909
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
It's like an improved version of 15

910
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
To me

911
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
And I know that might make a lot of people wince

912
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Because I know 15's battle system wasn't popular

913
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
But that's why I say improved version of 15

914
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
To me

915
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I feel like there's more point to some of the buttons that you're mashing

916
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
And it doesn't have all that crazy teleporting stuff

917
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
That is weird

918
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
That is not there

919
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
But I really like how when you do pause the battle to use fire

920
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
To use magic

921
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
It's really cool how everything moves in bullet time slow motion

922
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
And that just adds to the flair

923
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
This game has

924
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
This game has so much flair

925
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
And I talked about this with the demo

926
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
And there was a part of me that was like

927
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I don't know how they can keep that going

928
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Throughout the game

929
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
And there are some slower parts

930
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Like there are some side quests that you do

931
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
That maybe don't have quite the flair

932
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
That the opening of the game does

933
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
It definitely fills in some of the back story

934
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
It makes, again, characters that were

935
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Throwaway side characters in the original game

936
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Have full on

937
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Plot devices

938
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
In this game

939
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
And so forth, so there's that

940
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
But I would say maybe the game

941
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Didn't have quite that intense flair

942
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Moving through those side quests

943
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And so forth, but I'm pretty impressed

944
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
When you're going through the main story

945
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
There's an energy that this game

946
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Just doesn't stop

947
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
And I'll tell you

948
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
This shouldn't be a spoiler because this is a very well known

949
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Sequence in the original game

950
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
The motorcycle sequence

951
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
It is reimagined and it's in this game

952
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
And it's another one of those

953
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
They do something kind of different to it

954
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Where it's like, holy shit

955
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
This doesn't fucking stop

956
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
It's awesome

957
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And again, if you've played it, you know what I'm talking about

958
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
If you haven't

959
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Maybe in a few more months I'll feel a little

960
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
More at ease talking about some of these spoilers

961
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Openly, but yeah

962
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
It's got a certain energy level that doesn't stop

963
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
And the graphics and the

964
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Sound and music

965
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
They just, like Loki said

966
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
His wife thought it was a movie

967
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Right? I mean, it just

968
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
With the camera tricks that it plays

969
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
It just feels like you're really playing a movie

970
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
It's fantastic

971
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
So

972
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Fifth Dream Today in chat says

973
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Biggs is Charlie Sheen

974
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Circa 1986

975
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Okay, but Charlie Sheen never

976
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Had a voice as silky smooth

977
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
As Gideon Emery, who really adds

978
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Everything to that character

979
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
It's so weird hearing him

980
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Without a British

981
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Accent

982
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
And I read a review on the game that said they

983
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Couldn't unhear Balthier

984
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
And I'm like, I don't

985
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
If I really try to make myself hear that, I will

986
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
But, or Orangé in Final Fantasy 14

987
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Uh-uh, uh-uh

988
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
You know what's always for me?

989
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
It's Dragon Age 2

990
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Of course

991
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I always hear Fenris

992
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
And if you really want to hear that, you will

993
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
But I'm able to kind of let Biggs be

994
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
His own character, so it's pretty cool

995
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
He's cute

996
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Yeah, and you know

997
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Barret Jesse

998
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Barret in the demo

999
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Definitely has that

1000
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Same kind of hard edge

1001
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Hard ass Barret, but I think once you get past

1002
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
The demo sequence

1003
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
You start to see Barret's softer side

1004
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
About why, I mean, especially when his daughter

1005
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Is introduced for the first time, which again, that was in the original game

1006
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
And there, obviously

1007
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
That element that Barret has

1008
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
A daughter, is still in this remake

1009
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
And you know, you start to see kind of like

1010
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
More of the why is he doing what he's doing

1011
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
And so forth, I think they really kind of start to

1012
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Develop him a lot

1013
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Better than just like

1014
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
The Mr. T clone he was in the

1015
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Original game, they really kind of like

1016
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Flesh him out a lot more

1017
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
And especially some of the support, like

1018
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I will admit, I was never really on

1019
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
The Tifa bandwagon in the original game

1020
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
But I really

1021
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Like her in this

1022
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I really, really like what they have done with her character

1023
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Because she's

1024
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
She's a strong, bad ass

1025
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Fucking woman

1026
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
And she's great in this game

1027
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
And then they really fleshed out

1028
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Jesse, Biggs, and Wedge to be

1029
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Their own characters

1030
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Jesse's a little

1031
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I don't know, I have mixed feelings on Jesse

1032
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
But I think she means well

1033
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I just don't like boob armor

1034
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Yeah, yeah

1035
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
But yeah

1036
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I just like

1037
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I could go on and on and probably talk for three hours

1038
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
About just this game, but I'm really enjoying it

1039
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
And I think this game is

1040
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Absolutely going to come up

1041
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
When we talk about end of the year lists

1042
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
The one other thing I wanted to say about it

1043
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Is that everybody's talking about

1044
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
What's going to be Final Fantasy 7 Remake

1045
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Episode 2, or what's going to

1046
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
What's going to happen there

1047
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
There's a weird part of me

1048
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
That wonders if there's necessarily

1049
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Going to be one

1050
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I feel like they're going to do it just to

1051
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Kind of cash in on it and to get the money for it

1052
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
But a game like that's going to take a long time to develop

1053
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
And if this game truly stands

1054
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
On its own, which I fully

1055
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Believe it will

1056
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Will they need to do a second game?

1057
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Well, I think it will take less time

1058
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Because now that they have the engine

1059
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
It's more just

1060
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Creating the assets for it

1061
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
All the recordings and everything

1062
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Whereas a lot of the time

1063
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
From the initial development of this game

1064
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Was developing the engine

1065
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
It would run and all that

1066
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
So now that they have the tech in place

1067
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I think making more content for it is not going to be that difficult

1068
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
You mean it's not just running in 15's engine?

1069
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Because I think it's running in 15's engine

1070
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I think it's different in 15

1071
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
One other thing too

1072
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Because I like to spoil things for myself

1073
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Before other people do it

1074
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
There's going to be another

1075
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Ok, so that tells me

1076
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
They left the door open for more

1077
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
At the point where it ends there must be more

1078
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Because that's only scratching the surface of the story

1079
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Ok, interesting

1080
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Alright, well we'll see what happens

1081
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
And maybe it is going to be something where

1082
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Final Fantasy 13 had 13-2

1083
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Lightning Returns

1084
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
What are they going to call it? Final Fantasy 7 Remake 2

1085
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I guess it will have to be the name of it

1086
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I don't know what they're going to call it

1087
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
This will be very interesting

1088
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Chapter 2 Part 2

1089
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Chapter 2 is probably a better name for it

1090
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
But we'll see

1091
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Except aren't all the in-game things chapters themselves

1092
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
So maybe it would be

1093
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
We have volume 1 because then you have your chapters

1094
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Of your one book

1095
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And you have volume 2 which is

1096
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Tigerclaw in chat says

1097
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Rob, now that you've played the remake

1098
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
How would you rate it?

1099
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Is it better than the original?

1100
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I'm not fully comfortable answering that question

1101
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Until I actually beat the game so I can have

1102
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Had the full experience of both games

1103
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
But as it stands now

1104
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I'm going to find it very

1105
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Difficult to compare the two

1106
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Because I think the Final Fantasy 7

1107
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Original game was

1108
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
An amazing game for

1109
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Its time

1110
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
But now this remake is showing us

1111
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
There's so much more

1112
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
There's going to be all these people that complain that

1113
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Final Fantasy 7 was just really a mediocre

1114
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Game and didn't really stand the test of time

1115
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Here's everything this game

1116
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Could have been

1117
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Is almost I feel like the game I'm

1118
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Playing now or here if I could go back

1119
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
And do it over here's what I do

1120
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Differently I almost feel like

1121
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Is the game I'm playing now and so it's

1122
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
It's almost like apples to oranges

1123
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
A little bit or maybe not like apples to oranges

1124
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
But like apples to applesauce

1125
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Like I don't

1126
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
It's just I don't know if I'm ever going to be comfortable

1127
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Answering that question because Final Fantasy 7

1128
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Is great for its time

1129
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
And it's even a game

1130
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
That I would recommend as an RPG classic

1131
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Today but the remake is just

1132
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Different I don't know if I would say play

1133
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
This or that I would say play this

1134
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
And that can we rewind

1135
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
To 20 year old Jamie for a moment

1136
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Please who did not own

1137
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
A Playstation yet owned a copy of Final

1138
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Fantasy 7

1139
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Playing it on her roommate's Playstation

1140
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
And you know

1141
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
The whole Knights of the Round quadramagic

1142
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Blah blah blah making a sandwich you know

1143
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
But I had

1144
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Three and a quarter discs and I had

1145
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
A box full of them that was nothing but

1146
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Vincent fan art

1147
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Because reasons

1148
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I played I've beaten that

1149
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Game so many times I still

1150
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Have a working save file

1151
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Where Aerith gets you know

1152
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Skewered which is beautiful

1153
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
And then it goes right into the Jenova fight which is one of my

1154
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Favorite pieces of music in the game too

1155
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
And you know

1156
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
It's

1157
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
This was like my thing

1158
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
This was one of my

1159
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
It's been a while I go through

1160
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Phrases where I'll get something that's like my huge ass

1161
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Fandom this was my Mass Effect

1162
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Back then

1163
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
And I am super excited

1164
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
To play this one or to

1165
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
You know have me and Dan play it together

1166
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
You know do our take turn things whenever we do

1167
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
But

1168
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I think I'm going to love this

1169
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
As much as I love the original because

1170
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I love the characters so much I love the story

1171
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
So much and for me

1172
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I

1173
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I'm looking forward to drawing my own comparisons

1174
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
But I don't think I think they're each going to

1175
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Stand alone as their own just from the impression I've been

1176
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Getting from everybody agree and I think

1177
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I think also at a very important point about

1178
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
This remake there's a lot that

1179
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Could have gone wrong with this remake

1180
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
They could have easily fucked this game

1181
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Up easily

1182
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
They didn't and I think that deserves

1183
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Applause

1184
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
At least the parts that I've played they didn't

1185
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
There's very there's even even if they completely

1186
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Decide to take the story in a 180 or whatever

1187
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
There's very little that's going to make me

1188
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Change my mind on that I think they

1189
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
There's a lot that could have gone wrong and it really does

1190
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Seem like it didn't and they've done a very good job

1191
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
And it's interesting because now it has a lot of people

1192
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Talking about what about Final Fantasy 8

1193
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Are they going to do a remake of Final Fantasy 8

1194
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
And there's a part of me that's like

1195
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
No we don't need to go back and remake

1196
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
All the old Playstation games

1197
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Like make a Final Fantasy 16

1198
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Already but there's also

1199
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
A part of me that's like you know what

1200
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
And I've taken a lot of shit on the show for this opinion

1201
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
But it's my opinion dammit

1202
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Final Fantasy 8 is my least favorite

1203
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Final Fantasy game save the original

1204
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Version of Final Fantasy 14 which was

1205
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Which was hot garbage

1206
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Final Fantasy 8 is my least

1207
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
It's my least

1208
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
See I disagree but that's okay everybody's got their own rankings

1209
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Final Fantasy 8 is my least favorite and it's because

1210
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
It's not because of the story so for those of you

1211
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
That want to fight me on the story it's not

1212
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
That's not the reason I find Final Fantasy 8

1213
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Unplayable because of

1214
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
The junction draw

1215
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
And that whole battle system

1216
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
How the monsters level up with you

1217
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Which was the worst part of Final Fantasy 2

1218
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
And just everything in that battle mechanics

1219
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Everything in that system sucks

1220
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And I hate it and I can't

1221
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Play the game because of it but now

1222
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I'm thinking well wait a minute

1223
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
If they go back and do Final Fantasy 8

1224
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Then they get to keep what's good

1225
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
The story and they get to redo

1226
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
What's not good the battle system

1227
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
So from that perspective

1228
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Bring it on you know what

1229
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
This Final Fantasy 8 hater says

1230
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I would like to see that actually

1231
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Yes remake 8 do it

1232
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Because maybe that's actually gonna help

1233
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
In a lot of ways with some of my own

1234
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Issues about Final Fantasy 8 so

1235
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Anyway and yes I

1236
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Realize so many people

1237
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Have their opinions on Final Fantasy 8

1238
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
And that's fine

1239
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
S2100 Matt in chat says

1240
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
This is a perfect example of

1241
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
People will forget the endless delay

1242
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
If the game is done well

1243
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Poorly done delayed games become the butt

1244
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Of jokes forever

1245
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Kudos to that remark and this game

1246
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Again with all the

1247
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Flare and the strong art direction

1248
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
In this game and just how this

1249
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Game dances as you play it

1250
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
You see where five years worth of

1251
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Work went into this game

1252
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
You see it

1253
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
This game clearly took a long time to make

1254
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Anyway again I can talk for three

1255
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Hours about the Final Fantasy 7 remake but I should probably

1256
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Move on with other headlines

1257
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Other games I've played this week I've continued on Final Fantasy 14

1258
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
My Dancer hit level 80

1259
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
And I did play more Nier Automata

1260
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Until the 7 remake came out

1261
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
And I actually got as far as

1262
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I got past that amusement park

1263
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Level and I got to do the boss at the end of the

1264
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Amusement park again I'm trying to not

1265
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Super spoil although that game's been out a little bit

1266
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Longer but that was a real

1267
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
For me that was a really hard boss

1268
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
At the end of that so

1269
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
That game is very challenging

1270
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
But again I talked highly about

1271
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
That game last week I love the kind of like

1272
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Hybrid shooter slash action

1273
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Game that Nier gives

1274
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Y'all were right on Nier

1275
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I said it on Twitter I'll say it again

1276
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I missed out so I

1277
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Should go back and I will

1278
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Go back and finish Nier once I'm done

1279
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
With Final Fantasy 7 remake

1280
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
And then now somebody's saying but Persona

1281
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Rob you got to finish Persona 2

1282
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Yeah that's another one of those games where I feel like

1283
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Yeah I really need to revisit

1284
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
That because that's another one of those games where like

1285
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I feel like you all

1286
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Are telling me this and I've been resisting

1287
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Well I've been resisting I just haven't had the time to play it

1288
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
And I'll probably end up

1289
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Falling in love with that one too so we'll see

1290
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
So alright

1291
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Let's move on we have a lot of gaming news

1292
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
We want to cover tonight and get to that

1293
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
So let's start off with

1294
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Lowkey with some gaming news

1295
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Alright so let's talk

1296
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
A little bit about the

1297
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Side Xbox

1298
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Event that they did well not event

1299
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
But like they had their little

1300
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Stuff that they show off the new

1301
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Games coming out so there's actually some pretty

1302
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Cool interesting things here

1303
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
So one of them of course

1304
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Is a game called

1305
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Grounded which is a survival

1306
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Horror game or not make not

1307
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Survival game but imagine

1308
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Any survival game set in the universe of

1309
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Honey I Shrunk the Kids so basically

1310
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
You're shrunk down to the size of

1311
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Tiny little

1312
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I guess microscopic

1313
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Characters and then of course

1314
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Bugs and plants and everything are

1315
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Giant and you're kind of like in a backyard

1316
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Or something it's sim ant

1317
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I love that game

1318
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
But it's but the answer

1319
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Are much you know the

1320
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Insects are much bigger than you are so

1321
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I'm not sure what your scale

1322
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Is similar to like you know Honey I Shrunk

1323
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Kids or something like that

1324
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
So they have that what I thought was interesting

1325
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Because you know there's people there deathly afraid

1326
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Of spiders so they have an arachnophobia

1327
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Setting that you can put on

1328
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
So that you don't encounter spiders

1329
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Which I thought was interesting

1330
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
So they showed off that

1331
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
They also

1332
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Were talking about a

1333
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Game called Forza Street which is

1334
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Headed to Android and iOS

1335
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
And

1336
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
So that's kind of interesting

1337
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Because they couldn't just let Mario Kart

1338
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Be

1339
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Somebody at Microsoft was like how do we get a piece

1340
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Of that

1341
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
No I'm all about it I'm for it

1342
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
And then they talked a little bit about

1343
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Of course

1344
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Minecraft Dungeons is going to be releasing

1345
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
At the end of May on the 26th

1346
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Journey to the Savage Planet

1347
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Is getting

1348
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
An expansion called Hot Garbage

1349
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Which I thought was hilarious

1350
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
And that's coming out

1351
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
This week on the 15th

1352
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Then of course they talked a little bit about

1353
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Gears Tactics

1354
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Some of the new characters in that

1355
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Talked a little bit about

1356
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Hotline Miami Collection

1357
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Which is going to be coming out on

1358
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Xbox One at some point

1359
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Atomic Crops

1360
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
That's coming out on

1361
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
May 28th

1362
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And then they were talking a little bit about

1363
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Sea of Thieves is getting another update

1364
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
On April 22nd called the Ships of Fortune

1365
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Which has an expanded

1366
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Reputation system

1367
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
They have overhauled the competitive mode

1368
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
And new cosmetics

1369
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
As well as cats

1370
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
That's of course important

1371
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
That's the most important thing

1372
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Yes

1373
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
And then of course a little bit about Games Pass

1374
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Journey to the Savage Planet

1375
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Football Manager 2020

1376
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
We're going to be coming to Games Pass

1377
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
For Xbox One and PC

1378
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Last week and then Mistover

1379
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
And Stranger Things 3 the game

1380
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Are coming to PC Game Pass

1381
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Sometime in the future as well as the Human

1382
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Fall Flat expansion

1383
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Thermal

1384
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Evolstia Chronicles

1385
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
And Yakuza Kiwami are going to be

1386
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Available on both platforms

1387
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
As well soon

1388
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
And then they touched on

1389
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Xbox Series X

1390
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Seeing the games can be stored on an external

1391
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Hard drive

1392
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
They can be moved to internal memory

1393
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Or the official

1394
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Expansion drives in order to play them

1395
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
I think this is kind of similar to what they were

1396
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Talking about with even the PlayStation 5

1397
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Saying that those drives

1398
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Have to be of a certain spec

1399
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
In order to be able to run them efficiently

1400
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
To be able to load everything

1401
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
How you're supposed to so I think that's probably

1402
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Going to be similar with the Xbox

1403
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Where you need a fast enough drive to run

1404
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I wonder if it's like

1405
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
It's an archival storage

1406
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Like a workplace or something

1407
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Where emails that are more than

1408
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Six months old go to

1409
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
An archive and they take a

1410
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Lot longer to load because basically

1411
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
You're going back retrieving it and bringing it over

1412
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
To the current one so maybe that's kind of

1413
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Like what this is

1414
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
It allows you to have a place to store the game

1415
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
So you don't have to download it again if you're worried about

1416
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Bandwidth issues or things like that but it basically

1417
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Has to bring it over and copy

1418
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
It back onto the drive so you

1419
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Can play it from the super fast

1420
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
D drive maybe that's kind of what it sounds like

1421
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Like it's literally a localized

1422
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Backup storage type of thing

1423
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
And then of course they were also

1424
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Saying that several countries

1425
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
In western Europe

1426
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Project xCloud as well

1427
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
And Dragon Age Inquisition

1428
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Unravel 2 and Sims 4

1429
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Are now playable through that service

1430
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Yeah I still

1431
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Want to check out xCloud so hopefully I'll get to it

1432
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
At some point but Xbox Game Pass is

1433
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Continuing to be a great feature

1434
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I'm really happy to see what Microsoft's

1435
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Been doing with that I've been getting a lot of

1436
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
My value out of that

1437
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
During this quarantine period so

1438
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Yeah I kind of want to see

1439
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
What's on the PC one because

1440
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
That sounded interesting

1441
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Yeah and I did do the

1442
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Preload for Minecraft which is so weird

1443
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Preload but that's what it is for

1444
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Minecraft Dungeons because that gets like

1445
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
It's Minecraft but it's Diablo and I like

1446
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Both of those things especially Diablo

1447
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
So I'm really curious about that game

1448
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Yeah I'll probably pick that up as well

1449
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
I do want to play that so

1450
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
We'll have to play together then

1451
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Hey there's a Minecraft we'll play together for sure

1452
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Absolutely

1453
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Heck yeah

1454
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Good job by Microsoft this week on like a little bit

1455
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Of an update during this weird time

1456
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
They were all, like Major Nelson was in his house

1457
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Phil Spencer was in his house

1458
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Everybody was kind of at home

1459
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Kind of looked like that episode of Saturday Night Live

1460
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
If you saw that this week

1461
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
This is very strange, this is different

1462
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Well I watch a lot of clips of

1463
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Late shows

1464
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
And so everybody's been kind of doing that

1465
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Kind of weird

1466
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
As well

1467
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Hopefully they kind of expand out

1468
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Just making fun of the usual

1469
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Stuff that we have to deal with

1470
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
I don't know

1471
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
It was okay

1472
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
The weird one for me is that guy on

1473
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
CNN who actually

1474
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Has COVID

1475
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Who's still working

1476
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Because it kind of goes

1477
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
And he's doing it from his basement and everything

1478
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
So it's not like he's putting anybody else at risk

1479
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
But you're not supposed to go to work when you're sick

1480
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
And you're going to work

1481
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I mean yes you're working out of your basement

1482
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
But rest dude I don't know

1483
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
That's the only one that's a little weird to me

1484
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Because it kind of goes against the message of

1485
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
You're not supposed to work when you're sick

1486
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
And I get that he's in his own house

1487
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
And he's not putting anybody else at risk

1488
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
And maybe it's what he wants to do

1489
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I think he shouldn't but okay

1490
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
So anyway

1491
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Moving on

1492
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Let's talk a little bit about this story again

1493
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
And you might think Rob haven't you talked about this before

1494
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
And yes this topic has come up on the show before

1495
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Especially in this current situation

1496
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
It has to do with

1497
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Coronavirus slash COVID-19

1498
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
And the World of Warcraft pandemic experience

1499
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Why are we talking about it again?

1500
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Because it hit the mainstream press again this week

1501
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
And it's actually out of the Washington Post

1502
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
So it's a pretty big

1503
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Mainstream media coverage about what's going on here

1504
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
And it was talking a little bit about

1505
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
And it was actually written

1506
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I think the person that wrote the article

1507
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
For the Washington Post

1508
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Is like somebody who

1509
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I don't think they're a doctor

1510
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
But they know a lot about the technological

1511
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Ends of things and so forth

1512
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
And have a lot of insight to what

1513
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Is true in that scenario

1514
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
And how that kind of plays out

1515
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
With what's going on with COVID-19

1516
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
And so a lot of the Washington Post article

1517
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Kind of talked about the Corrupted Blood incident

1518
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Which I think a lot of you are familiar with

1519
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
At this point, long story short

1520
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
There was a raid boss

1521
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Who would poison you

1522
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
But people figured out how to basically

1523
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Take that poison from the boss fight

1524
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
And take it into the real world

1525
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
So to speak, not the real world

1526
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
But you know what I mean like the towns and so forth

1527
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
And Warcraft so that that poison would

1528
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Spread throughout the towns and so forth

1529
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
And it killed NPCs too

1530
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
It did, it would kill NPCs, it would play

1531
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Regular PCs of a different level and so forth

1532
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Ironforge and Orgrimmar

1533
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
They were overrun within hours

1534
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
NPCs would get it

1535
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
And then pass it on to other players and so forth

1536
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
So kind of interesting

1537
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
All the parallels there

1538
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
And there was even a paper that the article refers to

1539
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
That was published in 2007 that talks about

1540
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Their findings and so forth

1541
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
But what I find is interesting about this

1542
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Is the kind of summaries

1543
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
That this whole thing makes

1544
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
And so they reached out for some

1545
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Comment about that

1546
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Article in the current research

1547
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
About COVID-19

1548
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
So the doctor that did this

1549
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Let's see, it was Nina Fefferman

1550
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Who played World of Warcraft at the time of the incident

1551
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Has some comments about that

1552
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
On the current COVID-19 situation

1553
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Saying

1554
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
What I do is I study all the aspects

1555
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Of infectious disease outbreaks

1556
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
We really saw the full gamut of behaviors

1557
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
We see in the real world reflected in the

1558
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Player characters during Corrupted Blood

1559
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
There are games where you are encouraged

1560
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
To behave in a way that you would never behave

1561
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Offline

1562
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
You really have to know the game

1563
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Play it and understand the culture

1564
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
So you can make these kind of determinations

1565
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
That yeah, this is a pretty good proxy

1566
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
And then

1567
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
This actually was a quote

1568
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
From the other doctor that was a colleague

1569
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Of Nina Fefferman's

1570
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
critic Lofgren who said

1571
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Oh, I'm sorry, no, this was

1572
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Sorry, I'm doing this on the fly here

1573
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
There's two doctors, they're quoting back and forth

1574
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
But Nina Fefferman said this and I thought this was a great quote here

1575
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
It's not just that

1576
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
People were role playing

1577
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
People were being themselves

1578
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
And I thought that was a very

1579
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Kind of like harrowing

1580
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Quote about the whole situation

1581
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Is that in World of Warcraft

1582
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Although there are role playing

1583
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Servers and so forth

1584
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
People can go role play as another character

1585
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
The reason why this disease

1586
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Was spreading and so forth

1587
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Was not the result of somebody role playing

1588
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Or wanting to do something different

1589
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
They were doing what they wanted to do

1590
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
And I think they're drawing some

1591
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Parallels in this situation

1592
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
In that situation

1593
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
To what's going on in the COVID-19 situation

1594
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Where we all know

1595
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
We've seen it in the news

1596
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
How some people are not respecting what's going on

1597
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
With social distancing right now

1598
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Meaning that they are above this virus

1599
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Which does not discriminate

1600
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Against people based on

1601
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Whatever factor you can think of

1602
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
And especially today

1603
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Being a day of religious notoriety for some

1604
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
You've all seen the news

1605
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
About how some people

1606
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Don't care

1607
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
They believe it's not going to affect them

1608
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
And we'll see how that plays out I suppose

1609
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
But it's just very interesting

1610
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
In those comparisons

1611
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
That people were not role playing

1612
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
They were just being themselves

1613
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Dicks

1614
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
What's that?

1615
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
They were being dicks

1616
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
And people in the real world can be dicks

1617
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
We heard about

1618
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
There was the guy in New Jersey

1619
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Who they had to arrest

1620
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Because he was going out well knowing he had the virus

1621
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
And purposely infecting other people

1622
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Or the people that are recording TikTok videos

1623
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Of themselves coughing on all the produce

1624
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
To the supermarket going I've got COVID

1625
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
And even though they're lying about it

1626
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Fuck them

1627
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
They've actually arrested

1628
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Quite a number of people for doing that

1629
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
As well as those pastors

1630
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Who are like we're going to hold services

1631
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Fuck you

1632
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Actually the real heroes have been the landlord

1633
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
That changed locks on one of those churches here in Sacramento

1634
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
As much as landlords

1635
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Have been taking a beating on a lot of other things

1636
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
That is landlord done well

1637
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
In that circumstance

1638
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Azet in chat says

1639
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
There's going to be a spike in about a week

1640
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Gosh I hope not

1641
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
But you're probably right

1642
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Tigerclaw says

1643
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Another excellent example

1644
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
And that happens in MMOs a lot

1645
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
People will buy up the things they know

1646
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Are going to be in demand for the next patch

1647
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
This just happened in Final Fantasy 14

1648
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Which is a game I play a lot of Materia

1649
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Because these relic weapons just came out

1650
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
And they have all these materia slots

1651
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
So people were buying up the materia for cheap

1652
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Then the patch drops and they're reselling it high

1653
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
That's what people do in the real world too

1654
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
You all heard the stories about the people

1655
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Soaking up the sanitizer

1656
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
And the toilet paper

1657
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I know you all saw that one guy who had the warehouse

1658
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Or the politicians

1659
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Selling their stocks

1660
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Yes that too

1661
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
It's interesting and I thought

1662
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
It was worthy bringing up again

1663
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Even though we've talked about the pandemic

1664
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Especially hearing that from a doctor

1665
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
That people were behaving

1666
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
In this game just the way they would in real life

1667
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
And seeing these types of comparisons

1668
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Like you would think oh no people wouldn't troll people like that

1669
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
And then it's like

1670
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Fuck but they are though

1671
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
They are

1672
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
And so yeah there's a lot you can learn

1673
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
From what happened in World of Warcraft

1674
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
So

1675
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
SSJ100Matt says if you don't believe in this virus

1676
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Or think it's a joke come to New York City

1677
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
It's not great and it's sad

1678
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
And just

1679
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Sorry I almost get choked up just thinking about it

1680
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I was just there in New York City

1681
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
And obviously you know

1682
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I was there six months ago is nothing compared to

1683
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Being there right now and living amongst it

1684
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
But just know I am

1685
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Thinking of y'all and I love that city

1686
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
And I love the people and just

1687
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
You know but that

1688
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
That is as they say just the first place

1689
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
You're gonna see this type of thing hit

1690
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Other cities and especially in these places

1691
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Where people can't seem to follow the goddamn rules

1692
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
And I'm just very

1693
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Thankful whereas

1694
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
It was extraordinarily frustrating

1695
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Maybe to be the first date

1696
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Where they said nope shut it down

1697
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
No restaurants no bars and so forth

1698
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Maybe it was a little fresh but now in retrospect

1699
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I think most people in California

1700
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
And the San Francisco Bay Area

1701
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
And the greater San Francisco Bay Area

1702
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Are very thankful for that right about now

1703
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
I think we're all very thankful for that

1704
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
So anyway I don't want to speak out of turn

1705
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
But anyway

1706
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Alright

1707
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
So my thoughts

1708
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Really go out to you guys in New York City

1709
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
And just know that I love you

1710
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
And keep that distance

1711
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
But hold through

1712
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
We're all in it together

1713
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
And we'll all

1714
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Hopefully get through this

1715
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Stay the fuck home

1716
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
I am really happy that California

1717
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Sent ventilators there

1718
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Because they saw the need

1719
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Was lessening here at least for right now

1720
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
And they sent that and that is great

1721
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I'm so proud of my state for doing that

1722
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Well Rob we are a nation state

1723
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
We are a nation state according to our governor

1724
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
That was a very

1725
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Anyway I don't want to get political

1726
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
That was a very interesting power play

1727
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
And although I am

1728
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I know this is a weird thing to say

1729
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
But you guys know my mom passed a few years ago

1730
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
And in many ways

1731
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I'm so thankful she didn't have to see this

1732
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Because she was such a worrier

1733
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
This situation would have been

1734
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
So terrible for her mental health

1735
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
That like

1736
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I'm just thankful she

1737
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Didn't have to go through this

1738
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
But the reason why I bring it up is that she

1739
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
She loved Gavin Newsom

1740
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
And that would be the one thing

1741
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
She would be up and watching his

1742
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Press conferences every single day

1743
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
I tell you that

1744
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Political fangirling?

1745
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
She was

1746
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
She said she was going to write him in

1747
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
On the presidential ballot one year

1748
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I don't know if she actually did it

1749
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I love your mom

1750
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I miss her everyday

1751
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Let's go further down that

1752
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Let's change the topic quickly

1753
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
And talk about a different story

1754
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
DarkSakura, more gaming news

1755
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
So in other news

1756
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
We are getting more information about

1757
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
The Playstation 5 in the form of

1758
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
It's new controller

1759
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
DualShock? Screw that

1760
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
We have the DualSense

1761
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
And I'm looking at this thing

1762
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Holding my hands up

1763
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
At scale using distance

1764
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
And everything

1765
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
As people are

1766
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Saying it might

1767
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
It makes me think of a Saturn controller

1768
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
A little bit of a Saturn

1769
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Almost like the

1770
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Saturn dual analog

1771
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
You know

1772
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
And it's not quite a boomerang

1773
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I'm just saying

1774
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
I'm so glad you're making

1775
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Those comparisons

1776
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
And keeping it old school

1777
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Because Twitter instantly lit up with

1778
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Oh it's Microsoft

1779
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I'm looking for Microsoft

1780
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
It's Microsoft's controller

1781
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
And I'm going like what?

1782
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
What?

1783
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
The D-pad and the analog aren't even in the same fucking place

1784
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
And if anything

1785
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
It's shaped more like a Nintendo Switch Pro controller

1786
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I do not see the Microsoft comparison

1787
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Whatsoever

1788
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
And to be honest

1789
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
I really would

1790
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
I'm looking at the back of it as well

1791
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
At the curving on it

1792
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
It actually seems like it would be quite comfortable to hold

1793
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Yeah

1794
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
I can see where my fingers would fit

1795
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Holding the back behind it

1796
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
I can see where my thumbs would fit

1797
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
It looks like it could be a pretty good controller

1798
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
If this is the design they stick with

1799
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
But at any rate

1800
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
And I honestly

1801
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I think it's about damn time

1802
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
That they went to a different design

1803
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Although again though with the DualShock

1804
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
If it ain't broke don't fix it

1805
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
The DualShock was a pretty good controller

1806
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Although I have to say

1807
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
It's not that different

1808
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
All these are considered

1809
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Well and you know the problem I have with my wrist

1810
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
I can actually though hold

1811
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
My shift joy cons

1812
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
In their little

1813
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Cradle without a lot of pain

1814
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
So

1815
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
But going back

1816
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I think the thing that's weirding people out about the controller

1817
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Is the bra

1818
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
And if you don't know what I'm talking about

1819
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Look at that black shape

1820
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
The odd black against white

1821
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
The little

1822
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
It's more of a tank top

1823
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
But those little

1824
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Those little analog controllers are the boobies

1825
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
But it's a bra

1826
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
But anyway

1827
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Whatever Rorshark shape

1828
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
You see in that controller

1829
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I think that's like the white against black

1830
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Well we all know you love boobs Rob

1831
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
I do but that's the weird

1832
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Conflicting thing for some people

1833
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
But I also say

1834
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Since the PlayStation 2 era

1835
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
And probably before that Dreamcast

1836
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
When has there ever been

1837
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Just one first party color

1838
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
You know there's gonna be other

1839
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Colors so if the white on black bugs you that bad

1840
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Just there'll be others

1841
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Anyway sorry Darkshark I don't mean to interrupt

1842
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
But I had to

1843
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
At any rate

1844
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
It's called the DualSense

1845
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Not DualShock 5

1846
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
It was announced this past Tuesday

1847
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
It has

1848
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Some different features like haptic feedback

1849
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Adaptive triggers

1850
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
And a built in microphone

1851
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Which is interesting cause I mean

1852
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Gosh you know reading about the

1853
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Built in microphone kind of makes me think

1854
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Back to the old Famicom controllers

1855
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
I thought pole voice from Zelda

1856
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Pole voice exactly

1857
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
So

1858
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
At any rate

1859
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
It also is getting rid of the share

1860
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Button from the DualShock 4

1861
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Supposed to be replacing it with something

1862
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Different

1863
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
And the good thing about haptic feedback

1864
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
As opposed to just having like rumble

1865
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Especially you know

1866
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Think of it in terms of like

1867
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Say

1868
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Using your iPhone or you know

1869
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
My Apple Watch for example how the feedback

1870
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Is a little bit different like for example

1871
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Excuse me when I do my breathe app

1872
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
I get a different you know

1873
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Sensation for doing my breathing

1874
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
And I think it's gonna be great we're gonna be able

1875
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
To get all kinds of different levels

1876
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Of sensation from that

1877
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
You also have the adaptive triggers and the

1878
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
L2 and sorry

1879
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
R2 buttons so you get tension

1880
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Like you know the example

1881
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
From Nishino

1882
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Who is a senior vice president of

1883
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Platform planning and management at

1884
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Sony Interactive Entertainment

1885
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
He's saying that you can feel

1886
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
The tension of your actions like when drawing

1887
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
A bow to shoot an arrow

1888
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
So what they're replacing

1889
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
That share button with is a create button

1890
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
So

1891
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
They don't have much in the way of information

1892
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
About that but they said it'll come out

1893
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
They want to create

1894
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Epic gameplay content that's a direct

1895
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Quote those three words

1896
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
So then

1897
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
As far as that

1898
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Microphone

1899
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
They're doing it so that you can chat with your friends

1900
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Without a headset for jumping into

1901
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Quick conversation

1902
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
But they're saying that if

1903
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
You're gonna have like long term

1904
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Chat then you wanna use a headset

1905
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
You know

1906
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
It does still have that

1907
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Light bar but it's now

1908
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Hugging around

1909
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
The left and right sides of

1910
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
The touch pad

1911
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
And the buttons

1912
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Are now monochrome instead of

1913
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Multicolored it's using like this clear buttons

1914
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
With the grey icons

1915
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
On top of it and it does have

1916
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
A microphone mute button from the appearance

1917
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Of it so

1918
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
And actually yeah there's an update

1919
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Very recently that says that the

1920
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Dual sense controller will have a built

1921
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
In 3.5 millimeter headphone jack

1922
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Oh wow

1923
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
So it's still gonna have that

1924
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
They confirmed that on Twitter

1925
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
That's my favorite part of the tool stock

1926
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Yeah that's kinda nice

1927
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
That they're putting that technology right in there cool

1928
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
And you know

1929
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
The other thing too is that

1930
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I think it's going to

1931
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Do its

1932
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Charging

1933
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
I think with a USB

1934
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Yeah dual sense charges with the USB C

1935
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
With the port located on the top of the controller

1936
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Cool

1937
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
There you go

1938
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Yeah that's great

1939
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Some comments from chat yeah Tigerclaw says

1940
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
I bet the built in microphone will be used

1941
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
So that when you plug in a regular headphone

1942
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
You can just voice chat with the controller itself

1943
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Yeah Sony actually confirming that's pretty much

1944
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
What it's for it's kinda interesting

1945
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
I'm sure there's gonna be a lot of tin foilers that

1946
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Don't want their controller always listening

1947
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
To them but I guess there is a mute button

1948
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
On it and I guess you can always put tape

1949
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Over it if you don't like it I don't know

1950
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
I want pew pew mode where you can just say pew pew pew

1951
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
And have it shoot

1952
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
You never know you never know

1953
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Let's see YYR says

1954
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Haptic feedback ugh why do they have to put that nonsense

1955
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
In everything I don't know I kinda

1956
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I love haptic feedback I dig it in the phone

1957
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Although sometimes they overdo it

1958
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Some games and some things

1959
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Really overdo it on that

1960
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
But I kinda dig like the way they use it

1961
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
On the phone and I'm excited to see how that

1962
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Translates to cause obviously

1963
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
On the trigger buttons that's gonna be very different

1964
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Than the phone right that's gonna be

1965
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
A different kind of feeling so I'm kinda

1966
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
I'll give it a shot sounds interesting

1967
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Well there's the big thing about

1968
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Haptic feedback

1969
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
That I think is absolutely beautiful

1970
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Especially as we're dealing more with accessibility

1971
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
These days like

1972
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
I was reading a post from

1973
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Sturlok on Twitter not long ago

1974
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
About being able to play

1975
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Animal Crossing without being sighted

1976
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
And a lot of that comes in

1977
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
With you know the sound effects

1978
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Like the sound design in Animal Crossing is tremendous

1979
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
But with haptic feedback

1980
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
You know you have a better idea

1981
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
For you know say

1982
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
You know

1983
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Say that you are getting

1984
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Footsteps

1985
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Near you

1986
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
You know how sometimes depending on the floor you can feel them

1987
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Or someone breathing

1988
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
And you might get just like a little

1989
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Little subtle rumble

1990
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
When someone's breathing in the room with you

1991
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
You know

1992
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Or you know you're

1993
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Say climbing like a rope in your game

1994
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
And you get the feeling of the tension

1995
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Of the rope like have you ever been on

1996
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
A rope when it's about to snap?

1997
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Or pulled something that's about to snap?

1998
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
You kinda get that tension

1999
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
And imagine having

2000
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Feedback when you're playing

2001
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
A game that's just you know and for those of us

2002
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Who have I'd say

2003
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Full access to our senses

2004
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
You know

2005
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Think about the immersion that you're

2006
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Gonna get with something like that

2007
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
But I'm more thinking in terms of our

2008
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Friends who need more accessibility

2009
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
I think it'll be great for them

2010
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
And YYR is conceding that point in chat

2011
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Saying see I hate haptic feedback on my phone

2012
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
First thing I did was turn it off but yeah I get that

2013
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
It does make some things more accessible

2014
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
And that is very good

2015
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
And Mich in chat says

2016
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
I usually turn haptic off because it messes

2017
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
With the nerves in my hands

2018
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
So yeah it just kinda might depend on you

2019
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
And your body if this is something that is

2020
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Gonna work for you or not work

2021
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
For you I also wanted to address this point

2022
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Cause I thought this was a when we talk about

2023
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
That create button YYR says

2024
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
If YouTubers are creators

2025
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
What does that make the people actually

2026
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Creating games?

2027
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Artists in my opinion

2028
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
But that's my

2029
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Answer maybe yours is different

2030
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
I think this is our difference between

2031
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
A professional like a patissier

2032
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
And a home cook home baker

2033
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Or a pastry chef

2034
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Well that's what a patissier is

2035
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Yes I know I know for those

2036
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
That may not know yes

2037
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Anyhow

2038
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Alright any other comments on the dual sense

2039
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Controller

2040
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
It purred

2041
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Oh and then I will say this I think Loki

2042
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Had a story on this probably about two months

2043
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Ago where there was like a patent

2044
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Or something that had been filed on this

2045
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
We kinda knew this haptic thing was coming

2046
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
So you know for those that

2047
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Don't always like us covering the

2048
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Rumors and the unverified

2049
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Sometimes where there is smoke there is

2050
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Fire so we knew some of these things a couple months

2051
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Ago or at least we had a

2052
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
I don't know if it was a patent

2053
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
But they were

2054
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Just some of the features

2055
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
That were gonna come to the controller

2056
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
They just didn't show us what the controller looked like yet

2057
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
I felt like there was some type of tech specifications

2058
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Whatever I like I know we talked about the

2059
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Haptic thing a couple months ago so it's kinda interesting

2060
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
So anyway alright let's move on to the next story

2061
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Loki

2062
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Alright so

2063
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
This is kinda cool so everybody is doing their part

2064
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
To try to help

2065
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
In the 2019 situation

2066
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
You have folding at home

2067
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Allowing you to contribute in that sense

2068
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
To try to find a

2069
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Cure

2070
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Well now Borderlands 3 is kinda jumping in on that

2071
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
As well they have a thing called Borderlands

2072
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Science

2073
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
A game that you can play within

2074
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Borderlands 3 through

2075
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
In the Infirmary

2076
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
In Sanctuary 3 which is the spaceship

2077
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
In the game so

2078
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
What it allows you to do is actually

2079
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Kind of like a

2080
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Block matching game

2081
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
And apparently the puzzle

2082
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Game the way it works

2083
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
It's basically

2084
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Allowing you to

2085
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Correct millions of small computer errors

2086
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
That arise as scientists try to map

2087
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Microbiomes of the human gut

2088
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Apparently doing this will allow

2089
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
You to allow them to

2090
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Better understand

2091
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Or have a better understanding of the human body

2092
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Which in turn benefits research and the conditions

2093
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Like obesity, diabetes and even depression

2094
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
How does that

2095
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
How does that work? Is that you

2096
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Actually playing the game is doing that?

2097
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Or is it that the game

2098
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Is so low

2099
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Doesn't tax so many

2100
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Resources on your system that it actually

2101
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Uses some other resources in the background

2102
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
To do that other part

2103
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
So what I think it is

2104
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Is it's basically

2105
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
The computer does the matching

2106
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
And then anything that it can't

2107
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Figure out it's allowing humans

2108
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
To kind of look at

2109
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
To try to figure stuff out

2110
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
The game itself

2111
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
It's kind of interesting looking

2112
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
It's

2113
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
It does look like

2114
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Kind of like a block matching game

2115
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
I'm just trying to see

2116
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Like actually

2117
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
How you match stuff together

2118
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
I mean

2119
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
It's interesting

2120
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
It's interesting

2121
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
S2100Matt in chat says

2122
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Oh how nice of Gearbox to come out with this feature

2123
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
After hosting their employees on those

2124
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Performance bonuses

2125
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Yeah that's quite the

2126
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Retort although to be fair

2127
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
It was probably those employees who actually made

2128
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
This feature in the game so

2129
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
You know

2130
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
The other issue needs to be addressed

2131
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
A little more at the top of the food chain

2132
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
I believe so

2133
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Anyhow

2134
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
That story aside

2135
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
This is

2136
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
I love these kind of like gamers doing good

2137
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Kind of like harnessing the power of

2138
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Games to do these other

2139
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Things is pretty neat

2140
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Yeah it's interesting

2141
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
And it is

2142
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
It's a little bit I mean it is still like

2143
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
A match three type

2144
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
But it's a little bit different

2145
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Arrows that you have

2146
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
To basically insert at the bottom

2147
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Of your row to kind of move those rows up

2148
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
To match three

2149
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
And then it breaks them apart

2150
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
So it's a little different but

2151
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
It's interesting

2152
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
And I guess with that you also get

2153
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
weapons and stuff out of that

2154
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
You earn the in game currencies

2155
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Alright

2156
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Well we'll have to check that out

2157
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
I'll have to check it out I don't know

2158
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
I don't know Borderlands 3 yet

2159
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Yeah I haven't played Borderlands 3 in a while

2160
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
It's been on sale a lot

2161
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
I'll have to look into it

2162
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Especially now it's off the Epic store

2163
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
And it's available in more places so we'll see

2164
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Alright

2165
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Well anyhow moving on for now

2166
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Let's talk about Final Fantasy 14

2167
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
A game I do play a lot of

2168
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
And COVID-19 has had an impact

2169
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
On Final Fantasy 14's development

2170
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Final Fantasy 14 has been on a pretty

2171
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Almost like clockwork it's release schedule

2172
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
It's like they go X many a week

2173
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
There's a patch then there's another patch

2174
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
And then there's the expansion like everything is almost like clockwork

2175
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Which actually some people kind of criticize

2176
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
14 about is that it's

2177
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Patch cycle almost gets too predictable

2178
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Like it's going to be a dungeon here and a raid here

2179
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
And they don't tend to break that predictability

2180
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
A lot well

2181
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
The situation of what's going on in the real world

2182
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Is causing some things to get pushed back

2183
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Game director producer Naoki

2184
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Oshida put a

2185
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Update to the community this week about what's

2186
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Going on saying we are terribly sorry

2187
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
For the disappointment this may cause our players

2188
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
As we know you look forward to new patches

2189
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
However it's also important to prioritize the physical

2190
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
And mental health of our development team

2191
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Without whom we would never be able to release the

2192
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Quality updates and features you expect from Final Fantasy 14

2193
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
So we ask under your

2194
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Ask for your understanding as we adjust our

2195
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Schedule in accordance with the situation

2196
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
So basically talking about that this most

2197
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Recent patch most of the

2198
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Development was done for the fight because they just

2199
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Released a 5-2-5 patch

2200
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
That was pretty much done right before they released

2201
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Or right before all this you know work at home

2202
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
And all that kind of disrupted in Japan

2203
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
So now this is going

2204
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
To push some things back so they're

2205
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Basically saying 5-3 was going

2206
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
To come out in June

2207
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
It probably is going to miss that date

2208
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Due to the situation what's

2209
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Going on so you know

2210
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
And he's got graphic designing

2211
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Teams in Asia, North America,

2212
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Europe and all over

2213
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
So basically the game is going to

2214
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Have its content delayed for a month or two

2215
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
And really quite an explicit

2216
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Apology there from Yoshida

2217
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
To as somebody who's been playing Final Fantasy 14

2218
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Ever since the

2219
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Realm Reborn alpha

2220
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Let me say it's okay

2221
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
We completely understand

2222
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Like it's really fine

2223
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Like do what the team

2224
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Has to do to

2225
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Take care of themselves and so forth

2226
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
And yeah it's

2227
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
If things slip a month or two it's okay

2228
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
It's sad that

2229
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Fan fest may or may not happen in November

2230
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
I mean I know that's a ways out we'll see

2231
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Where the state of the world is at that point

2232
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
But it's

2233
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Really okay I understand there's other

2234
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Priorities right now and there's

2235
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Plenty of things to do in Final Fantasy 14

2236
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
And you know what if I get burned out on it

2237
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
I've got like a backlog a mile high

2238
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Of other games I need to be catching upon anyway

2239
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
So it's fine so anyhow

2240
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
I thought that was a very nice letter for them to write

2241
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
They really don't owe us that

2242
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
I thought it was very nice that they did

2243
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
But they didn't have to

2244
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Alright let's move on Dark Soccer are you back?

2245
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Okay I know she went ahead

2246
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
That's okay would you like to go ahead and do the next story

2247
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Or want me to come back to you

2248
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
I can do the next story

2249
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Anyway

2250
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
You know we've kind of

2251
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Gotten off especially with all the

2252
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
COVID news and everything

2253
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
About the protests in Hong Kong

2254
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
And the free Hong Kong protests

2255
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
So

2256
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Of all places for the protests

2257
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
To find a new home in

2258
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
It's an animal crossing

2259
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
So since people

2260
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Can't go to the street

2261
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Protesting in force

2262
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Is not physically safe

2263
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
People are going into

2264
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
An unregulated

2265
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Area to do so

2266
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
And that is animal crossing

2267
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
So they are putting up

2268
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
You know signs

2269
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
You can do your patterns

2270
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
And you can actually do nice big patterns

2271
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
That you can lay out

2272
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Like as big mats on the ground

2273
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Like people normally do pads

2274
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Some people have signs

2275
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
In their houses

2276
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Their characters are wearing

2277
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Gas masks and privacy masks

2278
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
And doctors masks

2279
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
And whatever things that can

2280
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Hide their face

2281
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
As a version

2282
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Of what they're going to be doing in real life

2283
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
And putting the information out there

2284
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
And reposting it to Twitter

2285
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Or wherever they need to

2286
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Having pictures

2287
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Of

2288
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
You know of people

2289
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
They've lost in the struggle

2290
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
People who are important to

2291
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
The protest

2292
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
And since you know

2293
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
They're wanting to

2294
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
And actually this is a quote

2295
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
That one of the students involved in this

2296
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Was saying that animal crossing is a good way

2297
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
For us to remind people

2298
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Not to forget what happened in the past

2299
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Eight months

2300
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Not everyone is open to political stuff

2301
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Animal crossing is a good way to promote our mission

2302
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
To those who are politically apathetic

2303
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
So

2304
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Keep going

2305
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
You know do it where you can

2306
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
I think it's beautiful

2307
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Now I believe there was

2308
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
A follow up or something

2309
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Animal crossing I believe has been banned

2310
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
And I think

2311
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
This stuff might

2312
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Have something to do with it

2313
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Obviously they're neither confirming nor denying

2314
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
But one can draw a pretty substantial

2315
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Conclusion from what

2316
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
History has shown us in this situation

2317
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
So yeah

2318
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Questbuster says just a week or so ago

2319
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
There was news about how animal crossing had a big

2320
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Launch in China and people started using it

2321
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
To recreate scenes including COVID

2322
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Checkpoints and now just recently

2323
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Animal crossing was pulled

2324
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
I hope all these people have physical copies

2325
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Yeah well it's

2326
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Isn't that interesting because

2327
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
You can't really pull it now that it's out there

2328
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
I mean you can stop it from being sold again

2329
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
But as you all know that just drives

2330
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Demand the product up even higher

2331
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Take your system offline

2332
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
So it can't pull a

2333
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
PT

2334
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
I realize China is a very different society

2335
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
And they have different ways of doing things

2336
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
But I still feel like

2337
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Once it's out there

2338
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
People are going to find a way

2339
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
They will

2340
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Well let's move on we have a few more stories for you guys

2341
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Before we get to the classic game of the week

2342
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Loki

2343
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Let's see so

2344
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Let's talk a little bit about

2345
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Stadia

2346
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
So Stadia of course you may know

2347
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Or are going to be hearing

2348
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
That Stadia Pro has gone free

2349
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
For two months so I'm assuming that

2350
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
With the whole everybody having to be home

2351
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
The whole COVID-19 stuff

2352
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
So they said

2353
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Google basically said in their blog

2354
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Hey video games can be a valuable way to socialize

2355
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
With friends and family when you're stuck at home

2356
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
So we're giving gamers in 14 countries

2357
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Free access to Stadia for two months

2358
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
That's from Phil Harrison

2359
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
And so basically with that

2360
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
You can access

2361
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Stadia Pro

2362
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
You don't necessarily

2363
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Need a Stadia controller or

2364
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Chromecast

2365
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
But you can

2366
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Use your controllers and stuff like that

2367
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
You do need a Gmail account

2368
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
To be able to participate in that

2369
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
And then of course it comes with some free games as well

2370
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
And they have

2371
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Of course

2372
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Destiny and Grit and stuff like that

2373
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
So is this something

2374
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
That you're going to jump back in

2375
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Since you've already got your free one

2376
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
You know what's funny I wrote some tweets

2377
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
About it because I was like I can't figure out how to

2378
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Reactivate this because

2379
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
I was on Pro thanks to the friend code

2380
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Thing because Bobby had given me

2381
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
His friend code and so I had it for three months

2382
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
And then I remembered to cancel it before the 90 days

2383
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Ran out so that I

2384
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Didn't get charged for another month because

2385
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
As much as I thought it was fine

2386
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
I never really intended to buy

2387
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Any more games on the service

2388
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
I was really just playing the free ones

2389
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
That came with Pro

2390
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
So I didn't really

2391
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
See the need to keep it and keep

2392
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Paying $10 a month for games that

2393
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
I kind of felt like there was more on

2394
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Something like Xbox Game Pass I wanted to play

2395
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
But I was like alright well if they're giving it away

2396
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Free for another two months maybe I'll go back and try it again

2397
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Because I don't dislike Stadia

2398
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I think from a tech perspective

2399
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
It's actually pretty impressive and I talked about this

2400
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
When I talked about playing the Stadia

2401
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Before

2402
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
It's like interacting with a YouTube

2403
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Live

2404
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
And it works pretty darn well and so I think it is

2405
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
A piece of technology worth checking out

2406
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
My only concern is

2407
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Again I haven't gone in there so I don't know how this one

2408
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Is set up but is

2409
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
This the gotcha gym membership

2410
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Thing where they get you to sign up for

2411
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
So many days free and then oh your

2412
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Credit card is on file which with

2413
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Google it probably is already

2414
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
On file if you've ever bought anything

2415
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Through Google they have your credit card

2416
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Info already if you forget to

2417
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Cancel are you going to get charged at the end of the 60 days

2418
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Again I don't know how

2419
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
This one is set up so I don't want to accuse Google

2420
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Of doing something they're not doing

2421
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Yes so here's what the way it's

2422
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Says

2423
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
You're cutting out a little bit Loki

2424
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
It says what?

2425
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Sorry so it says anybody that

2426
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Signs up for Google Stadia

2427
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Will get access to all the games

2428
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
It says if you're

2429
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Already a Stadia Pro member you won't be charged

2430
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Next two months

2431
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
After that Stadia Pro is $9.99

2432
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
A month but you can opt out of your subscription

2433
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Anytime so yes it is

2434
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
The hey sign up

2435
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Now for free but remember to cancel

2436
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
It before those two months are up otherwise

2437
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
We're going to charge you $9.99

2438
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
I

2439
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
If I'm understanding this that

2440
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Way then I actually

2441
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Think this is an incredibly

2442
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Shitty thing that Google did

2443
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Because they're using this

2444
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Situation to get

2445
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
People on their product

2446
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
If I'm understanding it

2447
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
That way that you

2448
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
You have to cancel yourself

2449
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
After 60 days

2450
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Or gotcha you're going to renew

2451
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
At $9.99 a month

2452
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Then I kind of think

2453
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
That's really shitty

2454
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Of Google to use this situation

2455
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
It is what they're doing

2456
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
So

2457
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
The best business as usual

2458
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
For a lot of subscription

2459
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
It is

2460
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
With that being said

2461
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
All I'll say is

2462
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
The technology is

2463
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Worth it but please

2464
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
If you do decide to do it

2465
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Immediately set yourself a calendar

2466
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Reminder at 55 days out

2467
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
To

2468
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Decide if you really want it or not

2469
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I will say this

2470
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Unlike a lot of gyms and that stuff

2471
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
When it comes to gyms you have to call somebody

2472
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Or cable you have to call somebody

2473
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
And they're going to try to talk you into staying

2474
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
I will give Google credit with this

2475
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Canceling you just do it online

2476
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
You click a button done

2477
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
So I will say that you don't have to interact with anybody

2478
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
You're not going to get pressured into staying or anything like that

2479
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
But

2480
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Just be warned

2481
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Ain't nothing really free

2482
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
In this world I guess

2483
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Alright

2484
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Make your own decision on if that's for you

2485
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Again from the technology perspective

2486
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
I think it is worth checking out

2487
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
But please set yourself a calendar reminder at 55 days

2488
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
To evaluate if you really

2489
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Want it

2490
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
YYR in chat says

2491
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Don't be evil slash strike through

2492
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
That part

2493
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Alright

2494
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Moving on to how

2495
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Business is being affected on

2496
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Different sides of the ocean

2497
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
The ESRB apparently

2498
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Still going amongst what's going on

2499
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
With the coronavirus and COVID

2500
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Is that there is no delay right now

2501
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
In assigning game ratings

2502
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
At least that's what they're saying

2503
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
I imagine most of that is still working from home

2504
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
From what I recall of the ESRB

2505
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
I don't think they're actually playing

2506
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
A lot of the games

2507
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
You kind of have to fill out a packet

2508
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
And they kind of assign the rating based on the packet

2509
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
And it's assumed that you did that in good faith

2510
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Because if they find out you didn't do that in good faith

2511
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Such as what happened with things like Oblivion

2512
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
And Grand Theft Auto 4

2513
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
With the hot coffee mod and all that stuff

2514
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
That's when things get dicey with the ESRB

2515
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
But they are still going

2516
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
They are still doing ratings and so forth

2517
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Whereas the CERO

2518
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Or is it pronounced CERO

2519
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
They are temporarily closed in Japan

2520
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Due to what's going on in that situation

2521
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
So there are no ratings currently

2522
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Being assigned right there

2523
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
That could cause a little bit of a backlog

2524
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
It may impact some of the game releases

2525
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
I don't know what's going to come of that there

2526
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
But that is a little bit of a difference

2527
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Of what's going on over there in that situation

2528
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
I don't know if they're actually playing the games

2529
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Or what happened in that scenario

2530
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Alright, well let's go back to a simpler time

2531
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Dang it, we're going to go back to when

2532
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
The games weren't rated at all

2533
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Actually I'm not sure the selection is from that period of time

2534
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
But we're still going to go back in time

2535
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
At least ten years

2536
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
And visit a classic game

2537
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Every week on this show Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault

2538
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
And says, hey, brats

2539
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Instead of playing these modern newfangled remakes

2540
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Why don't you go back and play the demakes of yesteryear

2541
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Dark Sakura

2542
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
This was top notch when it came out

2543
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
It was, this is much more than 8-bit

2544
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:12,000
A title from the CD and DVD era

2545
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

2546
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,000
This classic game is Project Justice

2547
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Which, like how have I not done this yet?

2548
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:24,000
I mean, I actually had to go check multiple

2549
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Things to see if I, you know, had even remotely done it

2550
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
So, as it was called in Japan

2551
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
It was Moro Justice Gakuen

2552
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Which basically burned Justice Academy

2553
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
The, you know, the previous before was

2554
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
She Needs Justice Gakuen

2555
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Which is private, Justice Academy

2556
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
So, it is a 3D fighting game

2557
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,000
That came out released from Capcom

2558
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
It's a sequel to Rival Schools and United by Fate

2559
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:54,000
And, which was, you know, first released as an arcade game

2560
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
In 2000 and ported to the Dreamcast in 2001

2561
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,000
And fortunate enough to have been able to play

2562
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
The arcade machine

2563
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Because they had it at SVGL

2564
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
I do

2565
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:11,000
I remember whenever we weren't doing that

2566
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,000
TBR tournament that was inside there

2567
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Because I was doing Perfect Attack at that one

2568
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
I was over there playing Project Justice

2569
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
That was the one where Jessica and I

2570
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Switched out in platform shoes

2571
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Remember we said we were gonna, we did

2572
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,000
A Perfect Attack wearing platforms

2573
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Which was pretty fun

2574
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I do remember that and I'm stepping away for just a moment, sorry

2575
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Okay, so at any rate

2576
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Project Justice is to this day

2577
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Probably one of my favorite fighting games

2578
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,000
As far as I love the Rival Schools

2579
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,000
This one is totally, totally, you know, for me

2580
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Just really goes there with it

2581
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,000
So, it is still a team fighter

2582
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,000
But you have teams of three instead of two

2583
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
So you get extra team up attacks

2584
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
That you can use

2585
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
But another one called a party up

2586
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:03,000
So that you would initiate by pressing any three attack buttons together

2587
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:06,000
And it is a three person attack

2588
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:11,000
That relates to whatever the school

2589
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Where that character comes from

2590
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:16,000
You also have an additional

2591
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
You know, your additional partner

2592
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Will also let you cancel an opponent's team up special

2593
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,000
By putting in a team up of their own

2594
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,000
So you have like a different short fighting sequence

2595
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Between one character from one team

2596
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,000
And whoever gets the first hit in

2597
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Will, you know, be the winner of that one

2598
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,000
And then it swimmers back to the main fight

2599
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,000
So you have a bigger meeting

2600
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Also twelve that's five levels

2601
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Instead of nine from Rival Schools

2602
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:50,000
The party up attack uses all five levels

2603
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Team up to two

2604
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Any attempts to cancel

2605
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Cost one level

2606
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Also carrying over from the first game

2607
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Project Justice from Dreamcast in Japan

2608
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Has a character creation mode that allows you to create your own team fighter

2609
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,000
It can be used in all the modes except for single player

2610
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,000
But its package is a board game

2611
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Which you do during an inter-school festival

2612
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Instead of the dating of the first Rival Schools

2613
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,000
You also

2614
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:28,000
And actually I have the Japanese version

2615
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
So I got to do this, it was pretty fun

2616
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:34,000
And you can also get sub characters

2617
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,000
That you can unlock through this mode

2618
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:43,000
You still have your players that are in the game

2619
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
And a few things that have changed

2620
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:50,000
So you've got

2621
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Like extra, you know, some of the other characters

2622
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,000
When you have new people to be hinted at

2623
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Like in the Rival Schools revolution

2624
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Or I should say, Phoenix Justice

2625
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Right now I forgot what it was called

2626
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
The Evolution Justice

2627
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Which I need to put back

2628
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Basically, things have gone back to normal in this

2629
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,000
And then there's a group called Reverse Society

2630
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:22,000
That comes back in so they have to fight again

2631
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,000
We have a new character, Kuro Kirishima

2632
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:28,000
And Momo

2633
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
I always miss a person

2634
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Karui Zawa

2635
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Who is like this pretty violent player person

2636
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:43,000
You also have the leader of the Gedo Gang, Daigo

2637
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Who was peripherally a character in the first game

2638
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Being mind controlled, so you have mind control

2639
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:54,000
And then you also have a Batsu doppelganger called Vatsu

2640
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:58,000
So trying to pin it all on Batsu

2641
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
So you've got all kinds of different stuff

2642
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
You have

2643
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
You even have

2644
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:09,000
They even go all out with your swimmer character

2645
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:15,000
And you can play as the school president and everything

2646
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
It's pretty fun

2647
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:21,000
But again, one of my absolute favorite fighting games out there

2648
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:27,000
There are people who didn't like it

2649
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
And those people are wrong

2650
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Famitsu gave it a 33 out of 40

2651
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:35,000
A lot of people, it got kind of an average review

2652
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Higher end of average

2653
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
But you know what?

2654
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
The game is fun

2655
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
That's the important thing about it

2656
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:48,000
It's got that goofiness

2657
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:55,000
It was friends of mine who did the localization on the first tribal schools

2658
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:03,000
And I think that we had just that same heart that went into the original localization

2659
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:07,000
They kept a lot of the Japanese dialogue

2660
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
The translation is like

2661
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:13,000
It's so funny if you listen to what people say in the game

2662
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
And you know enough to follow the conversation

2663
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Like, oh, I see what they went there with in this localization

2664
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
That's fully not what they said

2665
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
It's always fun

2666
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
It's fun

2667
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:29,000
I cannot state enough how beautiful this game is

2668
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:33,000
And we need to make it trend rivals schools 3

2669
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Make it happen

2670
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
We need to make it happen

2671
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
We need like

2672
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
I'm trying to think where they could go

2673
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Because we had Chirich Justice Gakuen

2674
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
And then had Moro Justice Gakuen

2675
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:49,000
What can they do that's even more than that?

2676
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Like maybe hot-blooded Justice Gakuen

2677
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
We already have burning

2678
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
We do

2679
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
But anyway

2680
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
The game is great

2681
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
If you haven't played it, sucks to be you, go get it

2682
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Somehow

2683
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
There it is, the classic game of the week

2684
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Project Justice

2685
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Which DarkSakura is amazed that she never picked before

2686
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
But there's always more hidden gems to be found

2687
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Like how could I have not

2688
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Questbuster in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says

2689
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:21,000
I love the days when Capcom could afford to be occasionally crazy with their ideas

2690
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Hugs copy of Pocket Fighter

2691
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
I mean

2692
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
There's

2693
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
I wish that we would get

2694
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
A 2D Capcom collection

2695
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
So that we can have things like

2696
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
CyberBots and Red Earth

2697
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
I have two copies of CyberBots

2698
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
I have the limited edition and the regular one

2699
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
But

2700
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
I would love to have

2701
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
The not released in America

2702
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Fighting game pack

2703
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Oh yeah

2704
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
There was just recently that Kunio-kun collection

2705
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
With all these NES games

2706
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
That were never released here

2707
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
And then of course

2708
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Secret of Mana 3

2709
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Or Trials of Mana if you will

2710
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Finally broke that barrier

2711
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
And the remake

2712
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Or remaster whatever you want to call it

2713
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Is on its way out pretty soon too

2714
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
So it's almost like all these old things that never came out

2715
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Are finally new again

2716
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Is Nintendo listening?

2717
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Mother 3? Hello?

2718
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
You know I actually bought

2719
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
A repro cart that had been translated

2720
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Just to sit down and play it

2721
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Mother 3

2722
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
If you want to borrow it you're welcome to

2723
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Did you see the Animal Crossing level?

2724
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
That opted all the

2725
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Stuff from the Mother series

2726
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
It looked really cool

2727
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
It was really well done

2728
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Google it

2729
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
It'll be out there somewhere

2730
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Did you hear what I read from Orange Wright?

2731
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
The Not Street Fighter Anniversary collection

2732
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Oh yeah for sure

2733
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
I'd love to see something like that

2734
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Just before we went on air tonight

2735
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
I don't think it's coming up later in the show

2736
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Capcom I think said

2737
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
They're looking at a rumor is

2738
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
I think it's a rumor that's why I didn't really put it there

2739
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
That Resident Evil 4 remake is coming up next

2740
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Even though

2741
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Who would surprise no one?

2742
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
That one is so good I don't know if they should remake it

2743
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Whatever they're going to

2744
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Because the other two have done very well in sales

2745
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
But there is a part of me that's like

2746
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Why don't you explore some other things

2747
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Some other games that you have

2748
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Well Dan and I were talking about this earlier

2749
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
And if they're going to redo one

2750
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
You know what?

2751
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
I want Code Veronica

2752
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
That's what a lot of people are saying

2753
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
It's funny you say that because that actually is like

2754
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
What comes the next breath

2755
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
What a lot of people are saying when people are talking about

2756
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
The Resident Evil 4

2757
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Code Veronica next

2758
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Yeah Thar66 in our chat right there

2759
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
I would have preferred Code Veronica

2760
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Yeah a lot a lot of people out there saying that

2761
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
So we'll see we'll see what happens from Capcom

2762
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Because I don't believe they've officially announced anything yet

2763
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Alright well there you go

2764
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Code Veronica though was to me pinnacle

2765
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
So just saying

2766
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
There it is the classic game of the week

2767
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Let's do some rapid fire news

2768
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Loki we'll start with you

2769
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
So the updates for No Man's Sky

2770
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Just keep on coming

2771
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
We've got pretty cool stuff

2772
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
In the giant mechs

2773
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
You get to pilot so the exomech

2774
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Is part of

2775
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Update 2.4

2776
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
And allows you to pilot these mechs

2777
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
And of course they are immune to planetary

2778
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Hazard and they

2779
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Have a pretty awesome cockpit as well

2780
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
And look pretty awesome in fact I

2781
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Decided to make the picture of the mech

2782
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
That they posted on Twitter

2783
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
My background for my work here

2784
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Looks pretty awesome it's almost like a little bit

2785
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
No Man's Sky-ish but of course much slower

2786
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Not as fast

2787
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
But

2788
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
I really do need to go play this game

2789
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Maybe I'll install it on my hard dress

2790
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
But yeah so

2791
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Check it out it's free if you own the game

2792
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Yet another thing to go check out

2793
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Exactly

2794
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Well if you're looking for some

2795
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
More pre-games to play during

2796
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
This whole COVID-19

2797
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Situation then

2798
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
You'll be lucky to know that

2799
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Just Cause 4 is going to be

2800
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Among the free games that are on

2801
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
This coming week on the Epic Games

2802
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Store and that's pretty awesome because I

2803
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Did skip this game which I think I did

2804
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
And maybe I have it in my catalog

2805
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
I don't remember

2806
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
And so

2807
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Yeah it'll be nice

2808
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
To have this and actually be able to

2809
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Now I'm second guessing

2810
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Myself maybe I did buy this on PlayStation

2811
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
4 and I just completely forgot about it

2812
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Maybe the first time that I've gotten the game

2813
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
And completely forgotten about it

2814
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
But anyways along with that

2815
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
There's going to be some other games

2816
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Including a visual novel

2817
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Of Aurelia

2818
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
That's also going to be coming

2819
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Free as well and then if you act now

2820
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Sherlock Holmes Crime and Punishments

2821
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
And Close to the Sun are free

2822
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
But those are only going to be free

2823
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Until Tuesday when these

2824
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
New games will come up and we'll be free then

2825
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
I get those annoying

2826
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Little messages in the system tray that remind me

2827
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
To download those free games so that's

2828
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Kind of nice I guess

2829
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Yes so definitely do that

2830
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Just because I should

2831
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Probably convince my son to download it

2832
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Because he'd have fun playing that game

2833
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Alright well let's

2834
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Move on to some other stories

2835
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
This one has to do with Discord and a new

2836
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Beta feature that's happening in Discord

2837
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Called the Background Noise Reducer

2838
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
You may have seen this in your own Discord

2839
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
It just showed up there for me in the bottom left

2840
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
So it is a noise suppression

2841
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Beta feature

2842
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
It's only on the desktop version of the app though not the mobile version

2843
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
And it is supposed to reduce

2844
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
And remove background sounds so voice

2845
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
And video chat folks only hear you

2846
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Speaking and you shouldn't hear that clack clack

2847
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Clack clack of a keyboard or the

2848
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Kids in the background or the pots and pans

2849
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Clanging or whatever it is going on

2850
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
The technology is from a company called

2851
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
Crisp and it is running locally

2852
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
It is not sharing data with anybody else

2853
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Development is still early on and they are

2854
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Working on a phone version of it

2855
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
So that's cool

2856
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
A lot of other meeting software could use something like that

2857
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
That's for sure

2858
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
I'm really excited about this other feature here

2859
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
That Twitch is looking at doing or is actually

2860
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Rolled out to partners

2861
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
It's called Prime Watch Parties

2862
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
So it's kind of like that Netflix Party idea

2863
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Except you're kind of leveraging Twitch

2864
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
And you have to have

2865
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
A Twitch Prime or excuse me

2866
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
A Amazon Prime to really like

2867
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
If you don't have an Amazon Prime subscription

2868
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
You don't see the webcam or whatever of the person watching

2869
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
But if you have both

2870
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
You get the webcam of the person watching in the corner

2871
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
And then you actually get like the

2872
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Amazon Prime show whatever they're watching

2873
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Timed up to where they're at

2874
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
In the main screen so you actually get both at the same time

2875
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
So it's kind of like an interactive watch party

2876
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
They've actually been kind of

2877
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Playing with this feature since October last year

2878
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
But now all partners have available

2879
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Have the access to be able to use this

2880
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
I was looking at one earlier today

2881
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
And my instant reaction was like

2882
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
I want to do this at VOG

2883
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
I want to get some of the

2884
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Star Trek, Starboard power coupling people together

2885
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
And watch episodes of Star Trek

2886
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Wouldn't that be great?

2887
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Except it's not out for affiliates yet

2888
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
And I'm not sure

2889
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
It's a little weird because you have to link

2890
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Your Amazon Prime account

2891
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
To your Twitch

2892
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
And since VOG Network

2893
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
This account isn't really a person

2894
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
I'm not sure we're going to be able to really do that

2895
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
So it might just have to be something on my personal channel

2896
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
But it's still something that I'm really interested in doing

2897
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Because I think that's really fun

2898
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
And especially in this day and age

2899
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
That's the type of stuff we could really use

2900
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
So yeah

2901
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
I think it's a really cool idea

2902
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
It kind of takes that Netflix party

2903
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
To the next level

2904
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Because Netflix

2905
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
That used to be a thing on Xbox 360

2906
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Then they kind of shot it down

2907
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
And then there's an unofficial

2908
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Google Chrome add-on

2909
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
That kind of does the same thing

2910
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
That hasn't been shut down yet

2911
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
So I don't know

2912
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
S2100matt in chat says

2913
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
First name VOG, last name Network

2914
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Middle name Smush

2915
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
You never know

2916
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
I don't want to break the rules

2917
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
We're professionals here most of the time

2918
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
So I mean if I can just use

2919
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
My personal account on VOG's thing

2920
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Then I would do it but I don't want to break the rules

2921
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
So as long as everything is

2922
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
By the rules then we'll figure out a way

2923
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
But if I have to do it on my personal channel then I will

2924
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
DarkSakura, how about you?

2925
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Well

2926
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
We have an update

2927
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
About Adi

2928
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Everybody's Animal Crossing

2929
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Grandmother

2930
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
The one who logged 3500

2931
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Hours playing

2932
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
On New Leaf

2933
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Well the internet got together

2934
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
All of her fans out there

2935
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
And had

2936
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
A crowd funding

2937
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
To buy her

2938
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
The limited edition Animal Crossing

2939
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Switch

2940
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Which I watched the unboxing

2941
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
It was adorable

2942
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
She's like I don't know how to do the button

2943
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
You know

2944
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
I want to say

2945
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Is this her grandson helping her

2946
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Create her character and everything

2947
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
But we need to see

2948
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
If Adi actually gets Adi

2949
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
In her town which would be great

2950
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
As we know

2951
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Nintendo of America

2952
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
So

2953
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
We'll see

2954
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
I just think it's an absolutely sweet

2955
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
She just looked tickled to bits

2956
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
And really amused by the whole thing

2957
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
And then

2958
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
In other news

2959
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Regarding Streets of Rage 4

2960
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
It is coming quote soon

2961
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
With classic characters

2962
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
And with soundtracks

2963
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
There was a tweet

2964
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
By Lizardcube

2965
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
That confirmed the existence

2966
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Of classic characters and the original soundtracks

2967
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
And also

2968
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Bringing back returning

2969
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Characters like Max Gate

2970
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
And Dr. Zahn

2971
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Are playable in their 16-bit forms

2972
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
With a price of $24.99

2973
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Confirmed

2974
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
But it does not confirm the April 23

2975
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Release date

2976
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
And only that it is coming out soon

2977
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
However there was an Australian

2978
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Nintendo eShop

2979
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Listing

2980
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
That stated that it would have

2981
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
A storefront release on April 23

2982
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
With a price of around $38

2983
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Australian dollars

2984
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Which is roughly $25 US

2985
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Listing says 12 unique

2986
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Stages and the ability to unlock

2987
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
And play as classic characters

2988
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
An option to switch out the new

2989
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Soundtrack with the

2990
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Original Streets of Rage games

2991
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
And so

2992
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Hey there we go

2993
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Alright sounds

2994
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Good I'm excited to hear that new

2995
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Soundtrack that sweet new Yuzo Koshiro

2996
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Music very excited

2997
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
I love Yuzo Koshiro's music

2998
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Let's travel around the world and check out the release

2999
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Dates for this week although I have a feeling

3000
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
There might not be a lot but we'll check

3001
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
In anyway and

3002
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Check out the releases so

3003
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Let's start with the US

3004
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Alright

3005
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000

3006
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000

3011
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Pretty much it

3012
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
I was just gonna see

3013
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
If there's any other digital games

3014
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Since this list doesn't have a lot of digital games

3015
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
So I'm gonna read some of the weird named titles

3016
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
That are on this list like for example

3017
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
We've got a game

3018
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Called Save

3019
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
Your Nuts on Xbox One and

3020
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000

3021
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Collection looks like it's coming out on

01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000

3023
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000

Games coming out

01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000

01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
There's a Guacamelee

3041
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Collection coming out that's I think the

3042
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Only thing I really see there

3043
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Looking on the PlayStation 4

3044
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Do we have anything different there? No that's

3045
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
That's it it's a very quiet

3046
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Week in Japan this week but

3047
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Considering everything that's going on I'm kinda not surprised

3048
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
How about the UK Dark Soccer

3049
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Crickets chirp chirp

3050
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Nothing until the 22nd

3051
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Yeah with all that's going on I'm not too

3052
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Surprised about that alright

3053
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
We're gonna do things a little bit out of order because

3054
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
I know Dark Soccer has to cut out soon here

3055
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
So I'm gonna shake up what you see on the

3056
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Sidebar a little bit so Dark Soccer do you wanna take your

3057
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Next story here which is actually at the bottom

3058
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Of the list there for those watching

3059
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
On Twitch for those on the podcast feed you have no idea what I'm talking about

3060
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
We actually show the upcoming headlines

3061
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
So we're gonna do this one down here at the bottom

3062
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Before Dark Soccer says goodnight

3063
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
This one's a doozy so

3064
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
It is a very very

3065
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Write up by

3066
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
CNET and I'm more than happy

3067
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
To share this with people but I'm gonna give you the

3068
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Cliff notes on it just because it is

3069
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Absolutely worth mentioning

3070
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
So they're talking

3071
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
About the upcoming

3072
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Systems in the climate crisis

3073
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
That our next generation

3074
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Consoles could be worse for the

3075
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Environment

3076
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
And

3077
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
There's actually a

3078
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Game studio called Wildworks where

3079
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Their CEO Clark Stacey

3080
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Is quoted saying I don't think it

3081
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Occurred to many people in the games industry to ask

3082
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
What sort of climate impact came directly

3083
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
From making and playing

3084
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Games

3085
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
But they're looking at

3086
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Things like the

3087
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Output of these

3088
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Systems and what they're releasing

3089
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
In just carbon dioxide

3090
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
For example the PS4

3091
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Said that

3092
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Basically if you have

3093
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
100 million PlayStation 4 units sold

3094
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Since 2013

3095
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Generated approximately

3096
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
9.8 million tons of carbon dioxide

3097
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Which would put it at

3098
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
108th place for

3099
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Emissions in 2016

3100
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
It would outrank Costa Rica

3101
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
It would outrank the entire country

3102
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
And then

3103
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
In energy usage that number

3104
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Would double

3105
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
And then

3106
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Xbox one

3107
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
They have a slightly

3108
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Smaller

3109
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
But a single

3110
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Xbox unit emits

3111
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
1.23 tons of carbon dioxide

3112
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Over an eight year life cycle

3113
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
And so

3114
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
It is a lot more friendly

3115
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Than say the PS4 for its release

3116
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
But it would still be 0.76 tons

3117
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
And

3118
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
If you were using a less conservative

3119
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Estimate

3120
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
That

3121
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
The general output from these systems

3122
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Would be something along the lines

3123
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Of taking between 40 and 95

3124
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Million flights from New York

3125
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
To Los Angeles

3126
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
So

3127
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Pretty intense

3128
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
So the video games industry

3129
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Please Sony

3130
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
And Microsoft

3131
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Have been challenged

3132
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
To do

3133
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
To do better

3134
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
And so

3135
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Actually

3136
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
For

3137
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
The average PCs

3138
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
And current generation of consoles

3139
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
They account for 2.4%

3140
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
Of residential electricity expenditures

3141
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
In the US

3142
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
And have a carbon emission release

3143
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Of 24 million tons

3144
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Which is about the same as Sri Lanka

3145
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
In 2017

3146
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
So a whole country

3147
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
The devices associated with it

3148
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Like the TVs

3149
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Were responsible for 66%

3150
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Of home energy use

3151
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
From gaming in 2016

3152
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
So going back to what I was saying

3153
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
The Microsoft and Sony

3154
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Have been

3155
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Definitely challenged

3156
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
There was a

3157
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
A conference

3158
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
I'm trying to get the name again

3159
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Because like I said this is a big article

3160
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
But they were challenged

3161
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
By

3162
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
In the UN's Playing for Planet

3163
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Alliance to create

3164
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
825,000

3165
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Carbon neutral

3166
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Xbox One X consoles

3167
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Which would be under 2%

3168
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Of all consoles made

3169
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
But every little bit helps

3170
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
But they're trying

3171
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
They're also wanting to

3172
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Make them

3173
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
More carbon neutral by buying

3174
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
High quality carbon offsets

3175
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Sony announced on March 18th

3176
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Mark Cerny who's the lead systems architect

3177
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
On the PS5

3178
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Did not make

3179
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
A single mention

3180
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Of energy draw or the environmental

3181
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Impact

3182
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
The only thing we have about this

3183
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Comes from Jim Ryan

3184
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
The present CEO of Sony

3185
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Interactive Entertainment

3186
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Who said that they would be able to

3187
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Suspend gameplay with much

3188
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Lower power consumption

3189
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
And that if 1 million users

3190
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Enable this feature it would save the equivalent

3191
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
To average electricity use

3192
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Of 1,000 US homes

3193
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
And

3194
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Nintendo however

3195
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
They

3196
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
I mean Switch uses a

3197
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Bunch less energy than the other systems

3198
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Lower processing power

3199
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
And graphic fidelity for one thing

3200
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Results

3201
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
In less energy

3202
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
Consumption

3203
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
They're focused on

3204
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Better games

3205
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Even if they don't have that

3206
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Hardware

3207
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
The size of those things

3208
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
They practically run off a rechargeable battery

3209
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
So it's kind of inherently built in

3210
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
And even a solid three hours

3211
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Of playing using the handheld mode

3212
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
It does not get hot

3213
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
And that's kind of one thing

3214
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
I was curious about is that

3215
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
I don't know if it's going to be realistic to say

3216
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Oh we shouldn't have Playstation 5

3217
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Or Xbox Series X

3218
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Maybe there's better things they could do in the manufacturing

3219
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Process like you kind of brought up there with some of the

3220
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Carbon free consoles

3221
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
But I wonder if there aren't maybe small measures

3222
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
We can take on the consumer side

3223
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
And you kind of brought one up there that maybe

3224
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
There's a thing you can enable there to use

3225
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
The lower power consumption in the background

3226
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
Maybe our consoles don't

3227
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Necessarily have to be always on

3228
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
I know it's very convenient to have

3229
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
The patch downloads and things like that

3230
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
I know my Xbox One started making weird noises

3231
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
So I kind of like

3232
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
I unplug it completely when I'm not using it

3233
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
And then I'll plug it in

3234
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
An hour before I plan on using it

3235
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
To do any patch downloads and things like that

3236
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
But maybe that's a thing

3237
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
I don't know

3238
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
I'm not saying everybody has to do it my way

3239
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
But maybe there's things consumers can do

3240
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
To cut back on some of that energy usage

3241
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
There's a little bit more

3242
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
There is

3243
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Clark Stacey again, the head of WildWorks

3244
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Has

3245
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Called out a few different things

3246
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
For example, I'm going a little bit more

3247
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Into cloud

3248
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Networking for data

3249
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Saves for games for all that

3250
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Type of thing

3251
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
And the fact that the data centers require a huge amount

3252
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Of energy pooling systems

3253
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
That make it run 24 hours a day

3254
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Forever

3255
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
And actually this is a different quote by Adele Tousie

3256
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Who's a data engineer at Monash University

3257
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
A typical cloud data center consumes as much energy

3258
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
As 25,000 households

3259
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
And Clark Stacey

3260
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
Who I mentioned earlier goes on to say

3261
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
That Google and Apple are leading the way

3262
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Basically saying that since the data centers

3263
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
Are 100% powered by renewable energy

3264
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Then

3265
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
This actually requires

3266
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
The companies that use renewable energy

3267
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
To invest in renewable energy

3268
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
For the open market

3269
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Ubisoft

3270
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
Has gone 99%

3271
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Which has

3272
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Basically

3273
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Had them to release

3274
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Far less

3275
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Carbon dioxide

3276
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Into the atmosphere

3277
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
But the thing is

3278
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
That a lot of these other groups

3279
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Are using

3280
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Cloud-based services

3281
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Or even their own

3282
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
I'm trying to think of

3283
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Just general

3284
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Operations

3285
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
If they could

3286
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Lower that impact

3287
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
That's how data centers

3288
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Make up

3289
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
They actually could make up

3290
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Approximately 60% of all energy uses

3291
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
In communication by 2025

3292
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
So

3293
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
We really need to be pushing them

3294
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Into

3295
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Using

3296
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Cleaner energy

3297
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Into

3298
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Finding renewable resources

3299
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
And this has to start top down

3300
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
But the thing is

3301
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
They're not really having

3302
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
The ability

3303
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
For

3304
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Climate change

3305
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Based on

3306
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Their current operation status

3307
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
They're not really having too much

3308
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Of an incentive

3309
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Other than

3310
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
The public

3311
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Poking back at them

3312
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
But

3313
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
If they

3314
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
We also need companies

3315
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Take to

3316
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
EA

3317
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
They haven't put any

3318
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Type of

3319
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Report on their emissions

3320
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Or their energy usage

3321
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
And

3322
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
Microsoft when their spokespeople did

3323
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Submit a disability

3324
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
Sony and Nintendo did not

3325
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Respond to a request for comment

3326
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
But

3327
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
And of course we have all of our

3328
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Handhelds too

3329
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
And some of the big companies

3330
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Are innovating and jumping the gun

3331
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
On getting the

3332
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Emissions reduced

3333
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
And making things with more

3334
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Renewable

3335
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
I think now a lot of

3336
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
Computers and

3337
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Handheld devices

3338
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Made from recycled material

3339
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
So that's good but we need

3340
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
To hold people's assets to the

3341
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Fire

3342
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
And I think awareness

3343
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Is probably a big component of this

3344
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
And one thing that we probably need

3345
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Our gaming media, our gaming press

3346
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
To do is now that we know

3347
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Where these things are coming from

3348
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Cloud gaming is the future but at what

3349
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Cost as you point out there

3350
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
We need our people that have access

3351
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
To be able to interview these folks

3352
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
To ask these questions. This doesn't have to be done in a

3353
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Punitive or a negative way but

3354
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
This cloud gaming sounds great but

3355
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
What are you doing to ensure that there's

3356
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
No harm to the planet from it or what are you doing

3357
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
To get back on these. We need these people

3358
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
To ask those because unfortunately

3359
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
We could say here on our little podcast

3360
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
And say those types of things and think about

3361
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
The things that we could do maybe a little more

3362
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Directly but we're not gonna

3363
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Realistically be able to really affect the change

3364
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
The way that people that have more direct access

3365
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Have the ability to do that

3366
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
If that makes sense. Like I was saying it has to start top down

3367
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
You know but

3368
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
You know we can also

3369
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
I'm sorry but I'm really surprised on Microsoft

3370
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
Side of things especially I know Bill Gates

3371
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
Doesn't run it anymore and in fact Bill Gates isn't even

3372
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Involved with the board anymore but I'm just

3373
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Surprised with him kind of being the legacy

3374
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Of Microsoft and everything. Him and his

3375
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Foundations on the planet. I'm really surprised

3376
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
They're not at the forefront of this

3377
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Which they ought to be

3378
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Microsoft has really been

3379
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
I mean they're late to the game in terms of

3380
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Environmental viability

3381
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
Other companies have really

3382
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Been doing a lot better than them

3383
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
I mean I think

3384
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
That will and here was what the exam

3385
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Say and

3386
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
This actually brings our current pandemic

3387
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
Into things. Look at how

3388
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
Much these places

3389
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Around us have cleaned up

3390
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Without

3391
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
The level of energy

3392
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
And material and

3393
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Being put out

3394
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
If we can get companies

3395
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
To do you know

3396
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
To what's the lack of a

3397
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Better description to

3398
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
To have that same kind of

3399
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Control to keep things isolated

3400
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
To you know using

3401
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
This renewable resource keep them

3402
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
Using recycled materials

3403
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
To you know put pressure on

3404
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
The government for example

3405
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
To find cleaner ways

3406
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
Of shipping

3407
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
You know games and all of that we can

3408
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Really really make

3409
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Such a big impact. You know piggybacking

3410
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
On that a little bit this is this is the hottest of

3411
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
Hot takes but some would say

3412
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
That you know and I don't know if it's right

3413
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Or wrong take it or leave it but some would say that

3414
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
The pandemic and what's happening

3415
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
Is in this I guess

3416
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
This depends on what you believe in in science over this is

3417
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
This is earth's response

3418
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
To the humans living on it not

3419
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Responding to climate

3420
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Change. You know I mean when you see that

3421
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
Direct impact that you know

3422
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
The pandemic kind of isolating people in their homes

3423
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Or this having on the climate you know

3424
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
Some would say that is the earth healing

3425
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
Itself. At least it's not

3426
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
The happening yeah right

3427
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
So anyway I know that's I know that

3428
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Is the hottest of takes but it is it's one of those

3429
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Things that makes you go hmm

3430
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Yeah and you know what and there's

3431
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Also this thing going on oh

3432
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
This is you know

3433
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
I don't think it's people that

3434
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
Are the virus I think that

3435
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
Is people's decisions

3436
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
We all have to be

3437
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Able to

3438
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
And now I'm going to be getting into a bit more broad

3439
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Outside of video games but we all have to look

3440
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
At what our personal impact is

3441
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
And we have to make good on it

3442
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
You know and I'm not talking about

3443
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Oh straight

3444
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Fuck that that whole thing was ableist as fuck

3445
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
But I mean we have to

3446
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
Look at the companies that we are

3447
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Shopping from and what they are doing

3448
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
And the fact that our money is supporting their bullshit

3449
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
You know

3450
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
We have to we have to find this

3451
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
We have

3452
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
People accountable and we have to

3453
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
You know and speaking

3454
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Of top down in this country

3455
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
We have to fucking start with top down

3456
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Alright

3457
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
So things don't shape up

3458
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Yeah you guys are both cutting in and out

3459
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
I thought it was maybe just my wi-fi

3460
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
And to my phone

3461
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
Okay oh boy alright

3462
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
So what I said is I said if

3463
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Things don't start shaping up

3464
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
We're going to have to start bombing makeup

3465
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
I think he's making a Final Fantasy 7

3466
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Remake joke

3467
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Oh yeah let's go hit Shinra

3468
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
And run the balls

3469
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
I definitely want to read this comment

3470
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Sorry no Bobby

3471
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
It's not the new noise cancelling

3472
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Because I specifically said before the show

3473
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Don't turn that on until we have a chance to play with it

3474
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
It's not the new noise cancelling

3475
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
I didn't even know it existed so I didn't touch it

3476
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Yeah

3477
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
VG Realness in Chat says

3478
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
I feel like some gaming press is afraid to ask the hard

3479
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Questions for fear of not getting early releases

3480
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
A big basket of bullshit in this industry

3481
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
I mean it's not even about this climate

3482
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Change thing which I mean is certainly something

3483
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
But I mean it's a whole thing

3484
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Where it's like we've known for

3485
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
Some time that you know outlets who

3486
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
Don't ask the hard questions get

3487
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
They get their hands slapped

3488
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
And you know unfortunately

3489
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
As Darkstalk was talking about some things are from the top

3490
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Down and when you see the same type

3491
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Of thing happening at the highest of offices

3492
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
In North America

3493
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Or excuse me in the United States

3494
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
I don't know what to say

3495
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
Anyway

3496
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
I also want to respond to pod culture

3497
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
To Brad

3498
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
Digital only is pretty damn clean

3499
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
But going back to the thing

3500
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
In that CNET article I was going off of

3501
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
Bear in mind that

3502
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
It takes energy for the downloads

3503
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
It takes energy to host

3504
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
The digital copies

3505
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
We're getting back into the cloud services

3506
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
And those cloud services use a ton of energy

3507
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Unless they are doing a lot more to offset it

3508
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
So even though it might be less physical waste

3509
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Which certainly would be a thing

3510
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Again there might still be a trade off

3511
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
For that so anyway

3512
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
And some folks in chat just kind of like breaking news

3513
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
Folks in chat are saying playstation network

3514
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Is apparently down right now

3515
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
So I wonder if there isn't a whole thing going on with the internet

3516
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
And I thought maybe it was just me

3517
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
Because for those that don't know

3518
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
How things are wired

3519
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
I actually have two accounts

3520
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
On discord so I have one account

3521
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
That strictly is on the wired

3522
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Connection and it also feeds in

3523
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
My microphone and the mixing board

3524
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
And so it kind of mixes everything with them on discord

3525
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
And then the way I listen to them

3526
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
So that you don't hear the feedback

3527
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
Is I am in on my own personal account

3528
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
On this wifi on my phone

3529
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
That's why I've been wearing headphones

3530
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
Ever since we started doing the

3531
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Social distance episodes of OLR

3532
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
So I thought maybe my wifi was cutting in

3533
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
And out so I was just kind of

3534
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Because I was watching the meters and they didn't seem to be dropping

3535
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
But apparently it's a weird internet issue going on

3536
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
So I don't know what's up

3537
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
So sorry guys but we're doing our best

3538
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Wish we could all be in the same room but it is what it is

3539
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
And as I said I was going to put

3540
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Because like I said there's a bunch more

3541
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
In this article

3542
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
So I posted it on

3543
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
My own account

3544
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
So

3545
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
If you want to read up on it

3546
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
And look at what you can do

3547
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Then

3548
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
I'd say give it a look over

3549
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
See what needs to be

3550
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
Done who needs to be talked to

3551
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
And hold their asses to the fire

3552
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Alright

3553
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
I have spoken

3554
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Alright well on that note Dark Soccer I know you need to take off

3555
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
So any final thoughts

3556
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Or last thoughts for our listeners tonight before you take off

3557
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Send me chocolate

3558
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Like legit

3559
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
No one guessed my fucking favorite chocolate by the way

3560
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
So it's

3561
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
Vosages

3562
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
It's the stout chocolate

3563
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
I require many bars of this

3564
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Sent to my house, message me for details

3565
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
And that is very true

3566
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Because every time I go to Chicago where they have a lot of it

3567
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
That's what I bring back Dark Soccer

3568
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
When she's doing the kitty sitting

3569
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
I can find by the way

3570
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
The bars at the nugget

3571
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
But I cannot get those delicious truffles

3572
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
Yeah those are harder to find

3573
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Alright

3574
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
And I love you for it, love love love heart heart heart

3575
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Alright take care Dark Soccer

3576
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
And we'll see you next week

3577
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Be well, be safe

3578
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
You stupid people stay in your house

3579
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Alright

3580
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
Let's move on to our mail bag

3581
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Participate at orangetontrader.com

3582
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
It's the place where you can send us an email every week

3583
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
We got one quick email tonight

3584
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
This is from Robert M

3585
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Who emailed us to say

3586
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
I haven't heard it discussed but after four years

3587
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
WayForward released their formerly Humble Bundle

3588
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Subscription exclusive

3589
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Cat Girl Without Salad

3590
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
On the Switch

3591
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Appropriately on April 1st

3592
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
They will be getting repeated over multiple plays

3593
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
At the few levels

3594
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Might not be worth the $9 for everybody

3595
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
But a fun distraction between New Horizons sessions

3596
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
$9 is really really low price though

3597
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
And thank you for the email

3598
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Appreciate that

3599
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
And just based on the title

3600
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
It sounds like something I want to check out

3601
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
The problem is

3602
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
And for me this is a big problem with the Switch overall

3603
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
It's great that they have a lot of games

3604
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
But their eShop doesn't handle that avalanche of games

3605
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
Very well

3606
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
It's not like

3607
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Steam

3608
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
Even Steam is starting to buckle under the weight

3609
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
It's not very easy to explore and find things

3610
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
Because I had no idea about this game

3611
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
Until you send an email

3612
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
So I think the best thing you can do

3613
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
When you have a little indie game

3614
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
That you like like this

3615
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
Help spread the word

3616
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
And I say it at the end of every Orange Launch Radio

3617
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Because it's true for us as an indie podcast

3618
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
We're never going to get the types of views

3619
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
That IGN Podcast

3620
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
GameSpot Podcast

3621
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Or employees that formerly worked for those organizations

3622
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
Having their own podcast

3623
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
We're not going to have those types of numbers

3624
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
Because we don't have that

3625
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
So the best thing you can do for us

3626
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Is help us spread the word

3627
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
And the same thing is true of these indie Switch titles

3628
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Because even though they're on the Switch

3629
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
They don't have Nintendo's name on them

3630
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
So spread the word

3631
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
That's why I like to do that for YYR

3632
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
We have a small audience here at Orange Launch Radio

3633
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
But I like to pimp YYR's games

3634
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
They're pretty good and I think people should see them

3635
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Especially, especially super multitasking

3636
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
It blows my mind that that game has not gone viral

3637
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
But you know, you gotta spread the word

3638
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
Tell people about the products you love

3639
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
So I will say this Robert M

3640
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
You are doing the right thing

3641
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
When it comes to how to spread the word

3642
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
For finding those games on the marketplace

3643
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
And I will check that out, Catgirl Without Salad

3644
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:29,000
Spreading the word by streaming games

3645
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
Is a big one as well

3646
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:37,000
Do you want to rob Robert's super hot take, Loki?

3647
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Do you want a really unpopular super hot take

3648
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
About streaming games?

3649
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Yeah

3650
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
I think, and this is my opinion

3651
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
And I'm speaking of no other streamer

3652
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
Or no other watcher other than myself

3653
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:55,000
I think it is a bad idea to stream Final Fantasy 7 Remake right now

3654
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
Because I don't think narrative video games like that

3655
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Make for very good streams

3656
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
Because if you drop in and out

3657
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
You're either gonna be spoiling yourself on the story

3658
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
For the game you hope to be playing

3659
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Or you're gonna be dropping in on something

3660
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Where you didn't see the whole few hours

3661
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
Leading up to this particular point

3662
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:17,000
And I just, there's a reason why I kind of stop streaming those types of games

3663
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Because I'm not sure it's always like

3664
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
It's not really what I enjoy either

3665
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
I don't necessarily like all the personalities

3666
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
That I do see streaming some of these games

3667
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
Kind of like doing their own voice acting

3668
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Doing their own voice acting

3669
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
Or doing their own thing on top of this

3670
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Like I just don't think narrative games like that

3671
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
Make for very good streams

3672
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
On the flip side, I think Animal Crossing

3673
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
And those more like evergreen games

3674
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
That are meant for user created content

3675
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
I think they're great games to stream

3676
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
And I think that's why games like

3677
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Minecraft and like a lot of things

3678
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
That are very like user, Stardew Valley

3679
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
I think that's why those games have tended

3680
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
To do very well on Twitch in the past

3681
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
Because I think those streams are better

3682
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
They also do a lot of creative things

3683
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
Oddly enough so like

3684
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
My kids watch a ton of Minecraft streams

3685
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
And Roblox stuff and all that

3686
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
I've started to watch more of those now

3687
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
And it's because it's not necessarily

3688
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
That it's just, it's vanilla playing Minecraft

3689
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:13,000
They do interesting things with it

3690
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Like for example, one I watched the other day

3691
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:19,000
It was two players trying to speedrun Minecraft

3692
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
While they have a terminator after them

3693
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
And the terminator is basically

3694
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
A AI bot that just hunts them down

3695
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
And while they're playing it

3696
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
And that made it interesting

3697
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
They have a person

3698
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
One person trying to speedrun the game

3699
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
And beat it, the other one has a compass

3700
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
That points to where the other person is

3701
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
And they're trying to stop them

3702
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
From beating the game

3703
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
And so those are fun

3704
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
Or like some of the

3705
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
Ultimate hardcore stuff that they do

3706
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
Or like

3707
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
Deathmatch stuff are pretty fun

3708
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
They can mix it up

3709
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
And of course my hot take

3710
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
Is getting a lot of comments in chat

3711
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
See what happens when you don't send emails

3712
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
That's gonna happen now

3713
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
You're gonna get a Rob Roberts really super hot take

3714
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Maybe it'll be on Drag Race, maybe not

3715
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
So some comments here

3716
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
That it's generating here

3717
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
Bobby Blackwell says I only stream narrative games

3718
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
If they were on MS-DOS in the 90s

3719
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
And again, I'm not calling any single person out

3720
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
And myself, I was streaming

3721
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
Ni No Kuni 2 when it first came out

3722
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
And then I kind of realized by the time I got to

3723
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Part 4 or 5

3724
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
If you didn't see Part 1

3725
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
Why would you come watch Parts 4 and 5

3726
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
And that's why

3727
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
When I see the tweets that are like

3728
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Come watch my Nier

3729
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
Nier Automata was when I was looking for videos

3730
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Because I love the soundtracks

3731
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
And I would see these videos that come up on the side

3732
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
Watch my Nier Automata Part 23 playthrough

3733
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
And I'm like girl

3734
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
If I didn't watch Part 1

3735
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
I ain't gonna watch Part 23

3736
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
But if all your streaming is Part 1

3737
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
I think that's different

3738
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
And that's what kind of Bobby gets

3739
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
So when you're doing the MS-DOS game in the 90s

3740
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
I feel like you usually do that first

3741
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
And then that's usually it

3742
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
And that's kind of where it gets

3743
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
Those first couple hours types of things

3744
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
Yeah, if I streamed Final Fantasy 7 Remake

3745
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
It would just be the beginning of the game

3746
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
Exactly, that's different

3747
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
That's a good little sample of the game

3748
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
And then you're not getting too far into it

3749
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
But I'm not gonna

3750
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
And this is any streamer I'm following

3751
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
And I love you guys, I love the community and so forth

3752
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
But if you're streaming Final Fantasy 7 Remake right now

3753
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
I'm not gonna visit your channel

3754
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
Because you might be further along than I am

3755
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
And I don't wanna be spoiled

3756
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
It's just as simple as that

3757
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
VGRealness says say their names

3758
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
Everybody

3759
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
Everybody is guilty, I've been guilty of it

3760
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
You've been guilty of it

3761
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
I'm calling out the planet

3762
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Let's see

3763
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
I'm dragging everybody today

3764
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
Says SSG100Matt

3765
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
Questbuster says

3766
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
I'll watch some classic game streams

3767
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Where no one says a thing

3768
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
But because I love the gamer I'm really curious about retro

3769
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
I'll stick with it

3770
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Again, different strokes for different folks

3771
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
Again, I'm not saying you shouldn't watch these streams

3772
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
You should actually, because I don't want to

3773
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
So somebody should be

3774
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
Supporting these streams

3775
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
But I just think

3776
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
It isn't the most compelling content

3777
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
To be streaming narrative games

3778
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Part 23

3779
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
That's all I'm gonna say

3780
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
Alright

3781
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
BobbyBlackWolf

3782
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
I'm laughing because of the comments in chat

3783
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
BobbyBlackWolf says Rob's being affected by Mako

3784
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
I keep wanting to say Mako, but now we've learned it's Mako

3785
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Rob's being affected by the Mako

3786
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
The planet is crying out in pain and he's mad

3787
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
Yeah, I'm mad

3788
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
Alright, let's move on

3789
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
Loki, quick, change the subject before I get another

3790
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
hot take out there that gets me in trouble

3791
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
So we should stream this too

3792
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Because it's going to be pretty fun

3793
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
No, I don't want to get cancelled

3794
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
So the

3795
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
LEGO Super Mario sets

3796
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
They're going to be launching

3797
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
August

3798
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
They of course announced this

3799
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
A few weeks ago

3800
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
So now we have

3801
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Some pricing and what exactly

3802
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
So I don't think it's

3803
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
Necessarily too expensive

3804
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
But the

3805
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
Starter set, a $60 adventure

3806
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
With Mario's starter course

3807
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
Yeah, $60

3808
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
If you pre-order it, you also get

3809
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
A little

3810
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
It's called Super Mushroom

3811
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
And Monty Mole

3812
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
So it's like a little collector's thing that you can

3813
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
Get as well to add some more stuff

3814
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
To that

3815
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
I'm not sure if you'll be able to

3816
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
I think they've stopped taking pre-orders

3817
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
Because it's already been so popular

3818
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
So there's that

3819
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
And then they showed off some new sets

3820
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
Piranha Plant

3821
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
It looks like a little seesaw thing

3822
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
With two piranha plants on it

3823
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
And that's $30

3824
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
And then of course the Bowser's Castle

3825
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
Boss Battle expansion

3826
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
Which is $100

3827
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
When you're talking about Lego prices

3828
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
That's not too bad

3829
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
Not a lot of pieces though

3830
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
But then again

3831
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
The Mario's

3832
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
The character itself

3833
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Is very sophisticated with these

3834
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
A voice

3835
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
And everything like that

3836
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
So I can understand how that might be a bit more expensive

3837
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
The Bowser's Castle thing looks pretty awesome though

3838
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
I gotta say

3839
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
Yeah, those Legos

3840
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
As expensive as they are, what else is new with Lego?

3841
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
They look so cool

3842
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
Honestly

3843
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
Sign me up

3844
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
Uncle Sam's sending me $2400

3845
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Why not blow it on Legos?

3846
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
I'm sorry

3847
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
I should but

3848
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
You know there's lots of people thinking it

3849
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
Like

3850
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
What dumb shit

3851
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
Am I gonna spend that

3852
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
And I shouldn't make a lie because a lot of people really need that

3853
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
For very serious things

3854
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
But there are a lot of other people that are like

3855
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
I should spend that money on Legos

3856
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
Why not?

3857
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
Anyway

3858
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
Pixel pockets in chat says

3859
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
I want the Bowser set

3860
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
Let's see

3861
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
They're talking about the ability to post gifts in the chat

3862
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
And I'm like yes I'm all for that

3863
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
You should be able to post gifts

3864
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
But Loki are you gonna buy the Legos and do some building?

3865
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
Probably

3866
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
Same

3867
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
Big same

3868
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
Let's move on and talk about

3869
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
What's going on in the chat

3870
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
What's going on in the chat

3871
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
What's going on in the chat

3872
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
What's going on in the chat

3873
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
What's going on in the chat

3874
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
What's going on in the chat

3875
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
What's going on in the chat

3876
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
What's going on in the chat

3877
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
What's going on in the chat

3878
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
What's going on in the chat

3879
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
What's going on in the chat

3880
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
What's going on in the chat

3881
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
What's going on in the chat

3882
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
Just wanted to know whether Blizzcon 2020 will be feasible

3883
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
They have a lot of their own employees

3884
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
In fact I think all their employees are working at home right now

3885
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
At Blizzard

3886
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
I mean certainly there's a whole side of event planning there

3887
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
So those folks are still

3888
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
Event planning

3889
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
Because

3890
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
They would rather

3891
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
Plan something and have to cancel it

3892
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
Than not have planned it at all

3893
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
And find out

3894
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
Miraculously we have a cure by the summer

3895
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
I know

3896
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
That's probably not realistic and I shouldn't even say that

3897
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
But you know you always cross your fingers and your toes

3898
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
Maybe something will come through

3899
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
But anyhow Blizzard does acknowledge

3900
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
That it could be several months before they know

3901
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
If they're going to be forced to cancel Blizzcon or not

3902
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
And that's the case with everything in the fall right now

3903
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
Like early on in this process

3904
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
It was definitely like

3905
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
DragonCon, Blizzcon

3906
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
FanFest, all those things that happen in the fall

3907
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
We'll be fine, this will be over by the fall

3908
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
And now the longer that this goes on

3909
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
They talk more about the curve

3910
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
The potential second waves

3911
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
And we don't necessarily have all the answers

3912
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
We don't really know

3913
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
Is it going to be safe for all those nerds

3914
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
Who don't always take a shower

3915
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
To be crammed together

3916
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
In the Anaheim Convention Center

3917
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
That might not be a good idea actually

3918
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
So

3919
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
We don't know yet

3920
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
We just don't know and neither does Blizzard

3921
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
And so we'll have more information on that

3922
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
In the coming months

3923
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
But there is going to come a point

3924
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
Where there is a go or no go

3925
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
Like there is going to come a point where

3926
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
They have to make their decision

3927
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
So we'll see what's talking

3928
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
Do you think they would try to do like a digital only event

3929
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
And money?

3930
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
I'm sure Blizzard would do a digital only event

3931
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
Would they charge money for it?

3932
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
That's a very good question

3933
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
Because Blizzcon

3934
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
Well, but Blizzcon is also all of their

3935
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
Championship games

3936
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
And if they can't really do that

3937
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
I guess they could just do it via distance

3938
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
I'm not sure

3939
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Like Hearthstone you could probably do that way

3940
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
But I'm not sure you could do things like

3941
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
Heroes of the Storm or Mythic Dungeon

3942
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
That's like 5 people or Overwatch

3943
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
I'm not sure you could do all those as easy

3944
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
So I wouldn't rule it out

3945
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
But yeah

3946
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
It's not necessarily

3947
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
Going to happen either

3948
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
Sia Tabiri in chat says

3949
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
I hope more comedians start doing Zoom shows

3950
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
This is a big thing in the

3951
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
Drag community actually too

3952
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
There's a lot of drag kings

3953
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
I know a lot of drag kings locally

3954
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
That

3955
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
Are doing their own shows on Instagram

3956
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
And actually

3957
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
I don't want to say who it is

3958
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
But I actually follow a drag queen

3959
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
On social media

3960
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
And I actually chatted with them

3961
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
And it's one of the Rugerolls

3962
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
So you know who they are

3963
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
That wants to start doing a Twitch stream

3964
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
And so I was giving them

3965
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
Like I was talking to them about

3966
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
Oh well good news so do I

3967
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
And I was telling them about how to download OBS

3968
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
And all that stuff so we'll see if they actually do it

3969
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
Because I think a lot of people really like

3970
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
The Twitch bits system

3971
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
As being able to donate and tip

3972
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
And some of that stuff on demand

3973
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
So a lot of drag queens are looking at Twitch

3974
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
As the ability to do that

3975
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
And so you know put any artist

3976
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
You might kind of roll your eyes

3977
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
Oh there's Rob talking about drag queens again

3978
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
But where that goes comedians

3979
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
And other types of artists

3980
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
Really follow especially the longer

3981
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
That this goes on

3982
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
That's for sure

3983
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
Yeah VGRealnessInChat says

3984
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
That must be really hard without audience feedback

3985
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
Or immediate feedback I should say

3986
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
It is weird watching

3987
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
Like even some of the late

3988
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
The late night shows?

3989
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
Yeah watching the audience

3990
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
Normally laughing and stuff like that

3991
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
Having their jokes without any of that

3992
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
It's a little weird

3993
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
I did watch some of the Saturday Night Live

3994
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
And it was weird

3995
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
Yeah I mean I appreciate that they did it

3996
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
And they tried it but it was a little weird

3997
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
But again for Twitch's benefit

3998
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
When it comes to those types of performances

3999
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
They have the chat room

4000
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
So they are getting that stuff

4001
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
I mean it might not be the actual audio laughter

4002
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
But they do get their ha ha ha's

4003
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
And their lol's and their emote icon spams

4004
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
In real time and at least it shows them

4005
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Oh somebody's out there I'm not just talking to myself

4006
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
And that goes a long way

4007
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
Anybody that's done streaming before knows

4008
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
Even though you still need to stream

4009
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
Even when nobody's watching

4010
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
And you need to act like the world's watching

4011
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
It does sure feel a lot better

4012
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
And rewarding when even one person

4013
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
Is there saying hi

4014
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
Oh lol or you know even this littlest thing

4015
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Will kind of like give you that motivation

4016
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
To keep going for a long time

4017
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
So anyway

4018
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
Let's move on

4019
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
So we already talked about the climate story

4020
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
DarkSakura did that before she left

4021
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
So let's go to Loki with our next story

4022
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
Yeah so this is kind of cool

4023
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
So you've been seeing a lot of company

4024
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
Loki you're cutting out so bad

4025
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
I don't know if there's even anything we can do about it

4026
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
What I'm going to try to do

4027
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
I'm going to reestablish your connection here

4028
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
Can you just hang up on the channel

4029
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
And come right back to reestablish your connection

4030
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
Literally turn it off and then on again

4031
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
It's the first thing I want to try

4032
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
See if that helps

4033
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
Because I don't know about you guys but it's very bad

4034
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
Okay try again Loki

4035
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
Alright

4036
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
How's that? So far so good

4037
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
Cool

4038
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
Yeah I think there's just internet issues

4039
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
And there's mosquitoes in the house

4040
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
Okay

4041
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
So anyways

4042
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
So you have different companies actually stepping up

4043
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
To build

4044
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
Ventilators and one of those now is actually

4045
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
A PC company of course

4046
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
Main Gear

4047
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
Who does a lot of different cases and whatnot

4048
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
And so they're actually building

4049
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
A ventilator called the Liv

4050
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
And it's basically

4051
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
It looks like it's built out of one of their old cases

4052
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
But

4053
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
It's a complex

4054
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
Oxygen delivery system

4055
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
With a touch screen interface

4056
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
And they say it can supply

4057
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
Oxygen in 1.5 seconds

4058
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
So pretty awesome that they're

4059
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
Going to be manufacturing that

4060
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
They said

4061
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
It can be manufactured at a scale

4062
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
At a quarter of the price of traditional

4063
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
Ventilators

4064
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
Though it's pending FDA approval

4065
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
But looks neat

4066
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
I hope those sorts of things

4067
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
Like FDA approval don't take so

4068
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
Long that by the time they're able to do it

4069
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
It doesn't matter anymore you know

4070
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
Yeah I think a lot of that stuff is kind of relaxed a little bit

4071
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
Because of the pandemic situation

4072
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
But

4073
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
I have a feeling that

4074
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
The process will be a little bit quicker

4075
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
And not to get like political

4076
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
Or too off topic but I kind of think

4077
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
These guys are getting ahead of the curve

4078
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
Because I think what's going to happen

4079
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
Is I think they are going to

4080
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
I think they are going to invoke

4081
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
That defense act or whatever it's called

4082
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
And they're going to force more companies

4083
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
To be creating things like tests

4084
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
And ventilators and things to help

4085
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
I'm kind of surprised it hasn't already happened

4086
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
But I think they're going to force a lot more companies

4087
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
To make these things in mass

4088
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
So that we can have the appropriate level

4089
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
Of response I really think that's

4090
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
How this ends

4091
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
Or not how it ends but how

4092
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
We have a path to normalcy

4093
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
I'll put it that way

4094
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
But we'll see again I'm not a politician

4095
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
That's just my tinfoil hat talking

4096
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
But to bring it back to games

4097
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
As you're seeing in this particular story

4098
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
Game makers are not necessarily

4099
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
Immune from that type of order

4100
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
Right? So

4101
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
I just ordered PC parts actually

4102
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
Because my computer has been doing this weird

4103
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
Like locking up thing lately

4104
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
And I was like you know what I just want to buy new parts anyway

4105
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
I actually got a new graphics card and I'm surprised

4106
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
A. I was able to find one

4107
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
And B. it got here as fast as it did

4108
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
Because I was quoted the end of the month

4109
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
For the card to get here and it showed up yesterday

4110
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
So I was like alright I'll take it

4111
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
But

4112
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
I have a new graphics card for my games I'm really excited

4113
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
Alright

4114
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
That's cool? Yeah

4115
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
Alright let's move on

4116
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
Last story here before we get to

4117
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
I think we are going to try to take calls tonight

4118
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
Because somebody told me they wanted to call in

4119
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
And I really wanted to hear from this person

4120
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
So I was like alright not that I don't

4121
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
I was like okay alright you know what I need to try to get

4122
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
The discord call thing working again

4123
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
So we're going to try to do it tonight

4124
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
And video we need to do video too

4125
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
Yeah we need to get video running again

4126
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
I didn't think this would be for that long

4127
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
So I wasn't going to force that issue

4128
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
But here we are

4129
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
So yeah that'll probably be a thing that comes

4130
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
Just don't rush me

4131
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
Alright if you want to call into the show

4132
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
Join the green room

4133
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
We'll get some folks here on the show

4134
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
So get in the green room just like always

4135
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
We're hiding in a different channel but go to the green room

4136
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
And I'll still put you in the place you need to be

4137
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
Alright

4138
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
For now let's talk about a 35 year old bug

4139
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
That's been patched

4140
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
Or at least that's the way it's being reported

4141
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
Although I'm not so sure I draw the same conclusion

4142
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
However

4143
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
An admin and a writer at the cutting room floor website

4144
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
Which is a really cool website by the way

4145
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
But the admin Gold S has released a patch

4146
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
For Super Mario Brothers

4147
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
Yes the 35 year old game on the Nintendo Entertainment System

4148
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
That will change Lakitu's behavior

4149
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
In saying in a quote

4150
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
The spiny eggs are thrown by Lakitu

4151
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
In a simple way

4152
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
With no horizontal movement whatsoever

4153
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
However

4154
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
This is not the intended behavior

4155
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
And is actually the result of a bug

4156
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
The eggs are supposed to be thrown out

4157
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
Relative to the player's speed

4158
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
Lakitu's speed, the player's position

4159
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
And a pseudo random value

4160
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
As well as bounce off any blocks

4161
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
Or walls that they hit on the way down

4162
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
So how the heck did he find that this was a bug

4163
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
He's just kind of assuming this was a bug

4164
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
Right

4165
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
But apparently when looking at the code

4166
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
It was kind of one of those things where it's like

4167
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
The code is in here but it wasn't really calling on it

4168
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
Da da da da da

4169
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
So that's where this patch came from

4170
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
I'm really oversimplifying but I gotta try and keep this short

4171
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
But

4172
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
One could also argue

4173
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
How many times has this game been re-released

4174
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
At this point

4175
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
We had the Wii version

4176
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
We had the Super Mario All-Stars

4177
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
We had the Game Boy Advance

4178
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
We had the Game Boy Color

4179
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
This game has come out again a fucking lot of times

4180
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
And did they ever change it?

4181
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
No

4182
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
So was it truly a bug

4183
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
Or was it one of those things where it's like

4184
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
We just accepted that this is the way it is

4185
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
And so we're not going to change it

4186
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
I think that maybe they just didn't want to fix it

4187
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
Because that's how it's always played

4188
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
And it would be weird if we changed something

4189
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
But it is interesting

4190
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
And Dr. Suya says I just thought this was neat

4191
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
Oh no, don't get me wrong, it is neat

4192
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
And I'm not saying anything bad

4193
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
Or mean against the person that found it

4194
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
I do think it's neat, I do think it's cool

4195
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
And it is just an interesting

4196
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
It is an interesting relic of

4197
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
We can't really patch the old games

4198
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
So

4199
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
Even though I'm saying maybe it just

4200
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
It just kind of became accepted as the norm

4201
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
It's interesting to think

4202
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
Because Nintendo could not fix it

4203
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
Did that just become embraced as the norm

4204
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
Lakitu's behavior and that's why it was never

4205
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
Fixed in a later release

4206
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
That might really be the reason

4207
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
We'll never know

4208
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
But if Super Mario Brothers were released today

4209
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
They could fix it

4210
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
I mean that's what they do with Animal Crossing

4211
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
So Nintendo can fix things

4212
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
They can patch things, they do it all the time now

4213
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
So it's just interesting

4214
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
YYR in chat says do we know for a fact

4215
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
That this was never changed in later versions

4216
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
They did make at least some changes

4217
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
In later versions

4218
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
Specifically

4219
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
Like All Stars

4220
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
I'm sorry, specifically Lakitu's behavior

4221
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
No, is not

4222
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
Different

4223
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
There's a great little side by side comparison

4224
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
If you want to look at news stories on this

4225
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
I was looking at an article at RetroRGB.com

4226
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
That had this article

4227
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
I think this was actually linked in our Discord

4228
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
Because I know I stole a lot of stories from our Discord tonight

4229
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
So thank you all to the Discord community

4230
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
Over at vognetwork.com

4231
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
Where I do borrow stories

4232
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
Especially on news weeks

4233
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
Where everybody's in quarantine

4234
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
So the companies aren't always putting out news

4235
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
At the same length

4236
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
But anyway, I'm looking at this

4237
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
And there's a nice little gif or a video here on the page

4238
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
That actually shows the before and after behavior

4239
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
And you definitely see in the after

4240
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
You see how the eggs have more of an arc

4241
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
More of a curvature

4242
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
To the way they're thrown

4243
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
Whereas in the normal game they just kind of go

4244
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
They kind of just plop down

4245
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
And you kind of outrun them in the normal game

4246
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
Whereas with the arcing

4247
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
It makes it a lot harder. You have to actually dodge them quite a bit

4248
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
It does, it does. It's interesting

4249
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
It's interesting

4250
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
SSJ100Matt in chat says, Miyamoto is willing to fix it

4251
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
But you have to put in a support ticket and he has to be billed

4252
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
At his regular rate from 1985

4253
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
I don't know about that

4254
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
I don't know

4255
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
I wonder how often

4256
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
He gets in there and programs things anymore

4257
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
I don't know. Alright

4258
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
Let's get to some calls

4259
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
I see a couple folks in the green room

4260
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
So let's try this out and we'll see how it goes

4261
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
Hello, you're on Orange Sounds Radio. Who's this?

4262
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
Hello, it's Delvin from VG Realness

4263
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
What a surprise to hear from you

4264
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
Hi Delvin

4265
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Don't act like it's a surprise

4266
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
I just missed hearing from you

4267
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
I missed talking to you

4268
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
And I just, I missed the world

4269
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
The way it used to be, but how are you?

4270
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
I'm doing great

4271
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
I've been enjoying

4272
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
The hell out of Final Fantasy 7

4273
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
Which is what I'm here for

4274
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
To talk about

4275
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
Okay, before I let you talk about that, can I just say

4276
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
Because I had to say

4277
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
You came out here to visit and you were on an episode of OLR

4278
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
Like a year and a half ago, right?

4279
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
And I keep saying, I'm gonna go to Toronto

4280
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
I'm gonna return the favor, I'm gonna go to Toronto

4281
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
Last year I couldn't go

4282
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
Because I ended up changing jobs

4283
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
Right in the midst of that

4284
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
And so I didn't have any time off, I couldn't do it

4285
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
So this year I was all gung-ho about going

4286
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
And then, womp womp, pandemic

4287
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
Toronto Pride gets cancelled

4288
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
And now the gag is

4289
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
You're not even gonna be in Toronto much longer, right?

4290
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
Well, who knows at this point

4291
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
I guess that's true

4292
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
Anyway, so I just

4293
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
Yeah, it's just one of those running jokes

4294
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
I'll go visit Delbert and return eventually

4295
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
But anyway

4296
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
In the meantime, you've been playing Final Fantasy 7

4297
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
Yes, I have been playing it

4298
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
And let me just preface this by saying

4299
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
I had to take a phone call

4300
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
Right at the moment when you started talking about it

4301
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
So if I'm repeating anything that you said earlier, I apologize

4302
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
Repeat away

4303
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
I've been enjoying the game a lot

4304
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
And I have a different perspective

4305
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
On the game that I don't know that

4306
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
Many people do

4307
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
Is that I didn't play the original

4308
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
Not by

4309
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
A choice

4310
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
I tried to play the first one

4311
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
And I had a little brother

4312
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
And anyone who has a little brother

4313
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
May have also experienced this issue

4314
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
They like to delete save files

4315
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
Off from your games

4316
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
It doesn't matter what it is

4317
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
It could be a game that they don't even play

4318
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
They would just go and delete your save file

4319
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
I don't know why

4320
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
But he did this multiple times

4321
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
When I had it on PlayStation

4322
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
And then I said, okay fine, forget it

4323
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
I'm gonna play it on PC

4324
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
So then I started it on PC

4325
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
Way back when it was

4326
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
98 or whenever

4327
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
Yep

4328
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
And then my computer crashed

4329
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
So I lost the save file again

4330
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
So I said, you know what?

4331
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
This is just not meant to be

4332
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
And I just never played it

4333
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
Because I was like

4334
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
I can't play disc one anymore

4335
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
God is sending a message

4336
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
Message received

4337
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
Yes, message received

4338
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
I'm not to play this game

4339
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
So I left it alone

4340
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
So anyway, here I am now playing this game

4341
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
And it's really good

4342
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
And the battles

4343
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
Are really seamless

4344
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
Honestly

4345
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
This game feels like

4346
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
This is maybe how they wanted

4347
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
Final Fantasy 15 to feel

4348
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
And what they were

4349
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
Going for but didn't quite hit the

4350
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
Mark because they ran out of time

4351
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
But the battle

4352
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
System just feels very fluid

4353
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
And I mean in 15, yes it was

4354
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
But this is just like perfected

4355
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
At this point

4356
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
So totally really good

4357
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
But what really has me

4358
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
Irritated is

4359
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
The fans

4360
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
Of Final Fantasy

4361
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
And the haters

4362
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
Get her Jade

4363
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
I don't know

4364
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
Where this hatred

4365
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
And vitriol is coming from

4366
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
For some people

4367
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
Some of the comments I'm seeing online

4368
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
Is that, oh you're paying $60

4369
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
To replay something in better

4370
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
Graphics just to pay another

4371
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
$60 for some quote unquote

4372
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
DLC when and

4373
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
If it arrives. So some people

4374
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
Are even going as far to say

4375
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
Oh well Square's not even going to finish

4376
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
The game. They're only going to release

4377
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
One and maybe two and then not even

4378
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
Release the completed

4379
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
Product. And

4380
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
I don't even understand where

4381
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
That comment comes from. Why they

4382
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
Would leave that money

4383
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
On the table to not finish it

4384
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
A fundamental misunderstanding

4385
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
That this is not the same product

4386
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
Anymore. That's

4387
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
The other thing

4388
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
Again I haven't played the original

4389
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
So I don't know but just going on

4390
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
Comments and things from

4391
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
People who have played the game such as yourself

4392
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
And other friends

4393
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
This is not disc

4394
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
One as it was

4395
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
In its original game

4396
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
Which is what a lot of people

4397
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
Are making the comparison. A lot of people are saying

4398
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
Oh it's just disc one in

4399
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
Better graphics and

4400
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
That's not what really is being put here

4401
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
And then there's gamers who have

4402
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
This purest attitude

4403
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
Towards the game and saying

4404
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
They don't want to buy the game until

4405
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
It's completed

4406
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
Because they feel it's incomplete or it's not long enough

4407
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
And my argument

4408
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
Towards that is

4409
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
A lot of people are saying

4410
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
Okay the game is only 30 to 40 hours

4411
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
It's not long enough so it's not justifiable

4412
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
To have the $60 price tag

4413
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
$80 if you live in Canada

4414
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
But whatever

4415
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
And the way games

4416
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
Are going today

4417
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
Games are generally 30 to 40 hours

4418
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
Long and

4419
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
You know for those

4420
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
Diehard RPG fans which I am

4421
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
A diehard RPG person as well

4422
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
We have to really think

4423
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
And consider what was a 100 hour

4424
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
RPG game back in the day

4425
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
Was it really

4426
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
100 hours worth of story

4427
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
Or

4428
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
Was at least a minimum

4429
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
Of 40% of that time

4430
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
So 40 hours of that gameplay

4431
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
Grinding

4432
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
Replaying dungeons

4433
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
Over and over killing things

4434
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
Over and over and over and over

4435
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
To make the game feel like it's

4436
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
100 hours

4437
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
I mean

4438
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
Don't get me wrong there are some games that

4439
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
I truly enjoy that

4440
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
But I don't want the game to be

4441
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
100 hours

4442
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
Quote unquote

4443
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
Just and then

4444
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
Making me have to grind

4445
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
To make the game artificially feel

4446
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
Longer just so RPG purists

4447
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
Can be like oh yeah I can

4448
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
Buy this game now because it's 60

4449
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
It's 100 hours

4450
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
And I don't know about your impression of what you've played so far

4451
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
But for me like when you are in that main

4452
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
Story this game has you

4453
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
By the balls and does not let go

4454
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
Like you are like it is intense

4455
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
Maybe when you're doing side quests

4456
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
And stuff you get a little bit of a cool down period

4457
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
But like god you need it

4458
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
Like

4459
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
Let me have a nap for a minute

4460
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
There's a lot going on

4461
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
Like I mean I'm not like

4462
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
Super like

4463
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
Pro at like you know games and there were

4464
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
Some battles where I like I died

4465
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
Are you playing on normal or easy?

4466
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
I'm playing on normal

4467
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
Oh okay well that's to be expected

4468
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
Yeah there were some battles I

4469
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
I died and

4470
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
It also goes against

4471
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
That old school RPG mentality

4472
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
Like I really think to get through

4473
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
Normal mode even you have to

4474
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
Use potions and high potions

4475
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
Whereas like in the old Final Fantasy games

4476
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
We would stockpile that shit

4477
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
Like I got 99 potions in my inventory

4478
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
I might need them I might need them

4479
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
No you are never going to use those potions

4480
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
Because you never do

4481
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
The remake

4482
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
So my number one advice to you

4483
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
Delvin on those

4484
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
Use the fucking potions

4485
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
Oh honey

4486
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
Honey

4487
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
She is buying the potions

4488
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
She is hitting the vendors

4489
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
When they're on sale

4490
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
Oh this merchant has it on sale

4491
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
I'm buying them

4492
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
I'm buying all of them

4493
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
Trust and believe

4494
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
All of them

4495
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
But yeah it's crazy

4496
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
I don't know where this attitude

4497
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
Is coming from from people about this game

4498
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
They want it to be a hundred hour

4499
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
Experience

4500
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
They don't feel like it's long enough

4501
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
And I just really wish that people would put that thought

4502
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
Out of their minds

4503
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
This not being a complete game

4504
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
You know and by that same

4505
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
Thought you know

4506
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
Do we look at movie trilogies as incomplete

4507
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
You know like the Avengers

4508
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
Whole movie saga

4509
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
Do we just

4510
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
We know more of it's coming

4511
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
So I'm not going to go and watch

4512
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
Captain America

4513
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
Because I know it's not a complete movie

4514
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
It's going to continue

4515
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
That's just a bad attitude

4516
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
You used the same argument I used on somebody on Twitter this week

4517
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
Which is somebody I like a lot

4518
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
So I don't want to make it sound like I'm fighting him

4519
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
Or I'm cutting him down

4520
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
But somebody whose opinion I value

4521
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
Replied to one of my tweets and said

4522
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
Well I don't really want to play the Final Fantasy 7 remake

4523
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
Until the whole thing is available

4524
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
And I just replied and I said

4525
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
You know you got to do what's best for you

4526
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
I said but I hope by that logic

4527
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
You didn't watch any of the Harry Potter movies

4528
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
Until all eight of them were out

4529
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
Well I mean yeah

4530
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
I don't know it just doesn't make sense to me

4531
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
Some of these comments

4532
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
That are being made that I'm seeing on Facebook

4533
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
And social media

4534
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
It's just unfounded

4535
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
And what I will also say

4536
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
One last thing

4537
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
Is that

4538
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
What Square is doing here

4539
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
I would really like to see them

4540
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
Go back and give this kind of refresh

4541
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
On some of the other games

4542
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
Because this is

4543
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
And I don't like that they even call it a remake

4544
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
Because it's not

4545
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
What we have instilled in our head as a remake

4546
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
This is not a remake

4547
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
This is a complete retelling of a game

4548
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
So to speak

4549
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
Ooh I like that

4550
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
I'm going to steal that one too

4551
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
Retelling, reinvention, reimagining

4552
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
For gamers to expect

4553
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
You know

4554
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
A developer to make

4555
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
Such a game

4556
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
That was originally 3 disc

4557
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
100 hours and still release that

4558
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
For you know 60 dollars

4559
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
I still think it's a little bit

4560
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
Unrealistic in today's world

4561
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
And the reason I say

4562
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
That is because

4563
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
A developer can make a game

4564
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
That is like

4565
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
A single player game not talking about like the destinies

4566
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
And the whatevers that are like

4567
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
Constant ongoing games

4568
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
Like a single player experience game

4569
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
You have to think about

4570
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
The amount of hours that would go into developing a game

4571
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
To make a game that's say

4572
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
100 hours worth of content

4573
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
Not everybody is going to play that

4574
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
Let's be real, how many of us

4575
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
Have single player games that we've bought

4576
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
And are sitting on our shelves incomplete

4577
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
So we want developers

4578
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
To put all this effort into

4579
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
Making these games

4580
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
So long that nobody finishes them

4581
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
And they don't make

4582
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
The money from

4583
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
I just want to know it's there

4584
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
I just want to know that the next time

4585
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
There's a pandemic

4586
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
I'll have entertainment

4587
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
I just want that peace of mind

4588
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
But no, I just think it doesn't make sense

4589
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
So I think this is a good approach

4590
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
Honestly, it may seem

4591
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
Like price gouging

4592
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
Like square trying to take our money

4593
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
But really it's not, they're really giving us a completely

4594
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
Different experience, the game is amazing

4595
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
It's gorgeous

4596
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
So to any haters out there I say

4597
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
Put that thought out of your head

4598
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
Go enjoy the game

4599
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
I do want to say this

4600
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
It's okay to not like the game

4601
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
I want to make that clear

4602
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
I don't want to say, oh my god something's wrong with you

4603
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
Well I don't want to say

4604
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
Oh there's something wrong with you

4605
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
If you dislike the Final Fantasy 7 remake

4606
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
Maybe it's just not your type of game

4607
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
Maybe the battle system

4608
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
There might be

4609
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
But my point is

4610
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
Know what it is you don't like

4611
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
About the game

4612
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
Don't assume you know

4613
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
What you don't like about the game

4614
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
Therein is the difference

4615
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
Yes, I totally agree

4616
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
So I just want to make that clear

4617
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
Because I don't want somebody to feel like

4618
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
Oh my god, is Rob going to drag me

4619
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
If I don't like Final Fantasy 7 remake

4620
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
No, as long as you know what it is

4621
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
You don't like

4622
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
Alright

4623
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
Every time I see this whole like

4624
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
Well I don't like it because it's only 10% of the original game

4625
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
I'm just like, then you clearly haven't played it

4626
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
No

4627
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
And you're just making a

4628
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
Flip in statement

4629
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
You didn't even bother to look at the demo

4630
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
You're making a snap judgment based off what everybody else on Twitter said

4631
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
Your opinion is wrong

4632
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
Sorry

4633
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
This has actually inspired me now

4634
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
I just actually downloaded Final Fantasy 7

4635
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
On my Switch, the original

4636
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
I'm dying to see

4637
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
What's changed

4638
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
I want to see how the first few hours of the game

4639
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
Played out versus this

4640
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
Just to see how different it is

4641
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
Ok, so like when I was

4642
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
Doing chapter 3

4643
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
And again I got to keep things very vague

4644
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
Because I don't want to spoil for those that haven't even touched the game yet

4645
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
But when I was doing chapter 3

4646
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
I was like, I swear

4647
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
This sequence was like

4648
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
5 minutes in the original game

4649
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
Like you go to this area, you talk to somebody

4650
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
And then you're on to the next area

4651
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
You're not spending the type of time

4652
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
So I had to go back

4653
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
I actually looked at a playthrough

4654
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
Somebody had one of those

4655
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
5 hour plays

4656
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
Maybe that's how I got on the part 23 and all that stuff

4657
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
But somebody had a Final Fantasy 7

4658
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
Playthrough and the whole

4659
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
Midgar section was 5 hours

4660
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
And I was watching it and I caught myself watching it

4661
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
And I was like, this, ok

4662
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
Some of these things

4663
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
Were definitely not the same

4664
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,000
I probably should have

4665
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
Considered just watching on YouTube

4666
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
Instead of downloading a game

4667
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
But whatever

4668
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
It's not like, like the question that came up earlier

4669
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
You know, is Final Fantasy

4670
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
Remake then better than the original?

4671
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
I don't, like better is a very

4672
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
Relative term, like the original

4673
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
Is good for its own reasons

4674
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
It's not the same game anymore

4675
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
That's the reality

4676
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
Yeah, that's like saying, is Final Fantasy 7

4677
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
Better than Super Mario Brothers?

4678
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
I

4679
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
That depends on a lot of factors

4680
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
Absolutely

4681
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
Alright Delvin, I so appreciate your opinion

4682
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
Are you producing any content these days?

4683
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
Are you still streaming or what?

4684
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
You got something to plug here?

4685
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
I only stream like very

4686
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
Very rarely

4687
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
Every now and then on my Twitch channel

4688
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
Twitch.tv slash VG Realness

4689
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
Go ahead, throw a follow

4690
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
And turn your notifications on so you know when I'm

4691
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
Streaming, but it's

4692
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
Here and there, but I'm probably gonna be

4693
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
Doing it a little bit more now as we are in quarantine

4694
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
But I need to finish FF7

4695
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
First, because as we just talked about

4696
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
It's not that interesting to watch

4697
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
Well not that it's not interesting, it's just

4698
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
Not good content

4699
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
But I will say this, I

4700
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
Downloaded and played Dotless because of you

4701
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
Because you were streaming it one night and I was like

4702
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
Oh I need to check out this game and then I tried playing it and I was terrible at it

4703
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
Hey, it's free

4704
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:29,000
It is free, so hey, I didn't lose any money

4705
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,000
So

4706
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
Alright, Delvin, thank you so much

4707
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
It was so great to have you on the show

4708
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
Thanks for having me

4709
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
Take care my friend, bye bye

4710
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
There was another person in the green room

4711
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
But they disappeared, so I guess they changed their mind

4712
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
But I'll give it another minute to see if anybody comes back

4713
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
In the meantime, do we have any last minute

4714
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
Stories, Loki?

4715
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
Yes we do, so apparently

4716
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
You may remember the whole

4717
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
Atari VCS console

4718
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,000
Well, we talked a little bit

4719
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,000
Back in October about how

4720
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
This company, Tin Giant

4721
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
Had resigned

4722
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
From project development

4723
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
Because they were saying that they were

4724
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
Citing six months worth of

4725
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
Unpaid invoice as well now

4726
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
Tin Giant, the head of

4727
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
That company, Rob White, has

4728
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
Formally filed a suit

4729
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
In Colorado Federal Court

4730
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
Claimed to breach a contract to the tune

4731
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
Of $261,000

4732
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
Because of unpaid

4733
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
Contracts

4734
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
So

4735
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
It'll be interesting to see what happens here

4736
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
I don't know

4737
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
I didn't ever hear anything positive coming out

4738
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
Of this Atari console, and I don't even know

4739
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
When it's supposed to be coming out

4740
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,000
The most recent release date apparently

4741
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
Of the console was March 2020

4742
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
And we haven't heard anything new yet

4743
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
Well, I'll cut them a little slack

4744
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
Because I'm sure the pandemic situation screwed everything up

4745
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
Let's be real

4746
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
The buzz for that Atari system

4747
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
Wasn't there

4748
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
Let's not mince words

4749
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
The buzz for that Atari system just ain't fucking there

4750
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
It's a very different story

4751
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
Than say Intellivision last week

4752
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
Obviously Bobby had Tommy

4753
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
On his show and it was a great interview

4754
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
I hope you guys all got to check that out

4755
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
And he's working hard

4756
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
To build buzz

4757
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
He even stopped by our little tiny

4758
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
Tent in the slums

4759
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
Here of podcasting

4760
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
To talk about Intellivision

4761
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
Bobby's talking about that Atari system

4762
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
Yeah, in fact

4763
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
According to the lawsuit

4764
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
Tim Giant actually

4765
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
They basically said that

4766
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
In fact it was Atari's own mismanagement

4767
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
Of the console project that was the cause

4768
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
Of the reason

4769
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
Or reason for delayed launch

4770
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
So

4771
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
I want to mention this

4772
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
In chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network

4773
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
Because Pod Culture was the person that was trying to get through

4774
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
On Discord and had some

4775
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
So Pod Culture says

4776
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
Just a quick anecdote about sending Christina

4777
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
My OG Switch

4778
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
So she could play Animal Crossing

4779
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:59,000
New Horizons

4780
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
While locked down

4781
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
You know you're actually not the first person I've heard doing that

4782
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,000
Because I guess the Switches are so hard to come by

4783
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
I've heard of like people mailing their relatives

4784
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:09,000
Because some people have a second Switch

4785
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,000
Lying around because they might have bought the Switch Lite

4786
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
Or they might have bought that Animal Crossing Switch

4787
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:15,000
Or what have you

4788
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
So for whatever reason they upgraded

4789
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
You're actually not the first I've heard of somebody doing that

4790
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
I only have one Switch

4791
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
So I don't have one to mail out

4792
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
But I have definitely heard of that

4793
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
So that is a very interesting side effect

4794
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
Of not many Switches being available

4795
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
Either

4796
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
So anyway

4797
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:35,000
Just wanted to get that comment out there

4798
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,000
Since he couldn't make the call work

4799
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
Any other last minute stories Logie?

4800
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
It says apparently

4801
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
That Xbox has committed to

4802
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
A digital only press conference

4803
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
For E3 2021

4804
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
That seems like a

4805
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
Long way out to me

4806
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
I do remember seeing that

4807
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
I was going to bundle that with the inside Xbox thing

4808
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
Yeah they basically said

4809
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
They've made the decision to transition

4810
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
All external and internal events

4811
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:03,000
To digital first experience through

4812
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,000
July 2021

4813
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:07,000
That seems like a long way out

4814
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:09,000
To say you're going to do digital

4815
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
But okay if it's digital first

4816
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:13,000
Then I can sort of

4817
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,000
Just going more the Nintendo route

4818
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
And keeping things with the direct and so forth

4819
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:19,000
It'll be interesting

4820
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:21,000
Yeah so we'll see

4821
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:23,000
Alright

4822
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:25,000
Alright well if that's it for last minute stories

4823
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
I think we'll go ahead and wrap up tonight's show

4824
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
We've been going for a little while tonight

4825
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,000
It's a little longer than our last few shows

4826
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:33,000
So we have a lot to talk about tonight

4827
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:35,000
But I hope everyone enjoyed the show

4828
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
And I want to say thank you so much for tuning in tonight

4829
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
Whether it was live here at Twitch TV

4830
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,000
Thank you so much for being here

4831
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
Whether it was on iTunes or Google Podcast

4832
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
Or Spotify don't forget we're there now

4833
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:47,000
Or wherever it is you listen to podcasts

4834
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
Help us spread the word, tell a friend or two about the show

4835
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
Because we only get folks here

4836
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
Listening if they know about the show

4837
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
So we are the show where every gamer has a voice

4838
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
But you've got to help us recruit those voices to get here

4839
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
Auto host on Twitch

4840
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
Those go a long long way

4841
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
More than I could ever really tell you

4842
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
So please those are all fantastic as well

4843
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
Really appreciate those hosts

4844
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
So I think that's all I have

4845
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
On that side of things

4846
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
So let's wrap up with our final thoughts

4847
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
Loki, have a great week

4848
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
We'll see you again next week

4849
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
Stay safe and let's hope we get some good news

4850
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
On the curve and maybe things start to go downhill

4851
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
As far as, you know what I mean

4852
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
Like down the hill

4853
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
Not like things going downhill

4854
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,000
But things going down the hill on the COVID situation this week

4855
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:31,000
And maybe some good news to report next week

4856
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
But any last thoughts for our listeners tonight?

4857
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
No that's it

4858
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
Hopefully we'll play some more games this week

4859
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
I would like to start working on my game

4860
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
I just haven't been able to work that out

4861
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
I've been switching up my grocery shopping days

4862
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
And so it's

4863
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
It takes a long time to grocery shop

4864
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
You just have to go to three different stores

4865
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
To get everything

4866
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
But we were like super stocked up

4867
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
So hopefully next week it'll be a little lighter

4868
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
Yeah that's good

4869
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:59,000
And my final thought is

4870
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:01,000
We do a lot of grocery shopping too

4871
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
But I really like food delivery

4872
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
And supporting local restaurants

4873
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
But it's so expensive

4874
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
Like if we could find any way to cut the cost down

4875
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:11,000
That'd be great but you know

4876
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
We gotta pay the drivers

4877
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:15,000
We gotta pay the restaurants and so forth

4878
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,000
So I guess maybe I need to do a little more takeout

4879
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,000
But it's hard because you want to help everybody

4880
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
But at the end of the day

4881
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,000
I had an amazing Thai meal from downtown

4882
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:25,000
On Friday it was so good

4883
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:27,000
So

4884
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:29,000
I definitely know as soon as this whole thing is over

4885
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:31,000
I'm going back to eating out

4886
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:33,000
Because it's so good

4887
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:35,000
Alright anyway

4888
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,000
That's it

4889
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:39,000
We're going to wrap up for this week

4890
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:41,000
We'll be back in seven days to do it again

4891
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:43,000
Happy gaming whether it's Animal Crossing

4892
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:45,000
Final Fantasy 7 Remake

4893
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:47,000
Persona

4894
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:49,000
Whatever it is you're into this week

4895
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:51,000
We hope you're having a great time doing it

4896
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,000
Have fun, stay safe, stay indoors

4897
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:55,000
Keep your distance

4898
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:57,000
And we'll be back in seven days to talk all over again

4899
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:59,000
Thank you so much everybody

4900
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:01,000
Have a wonderful night

4901
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:05,000
See you next week

4902
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,000
Thanks for watching!
