0	18240	This week, Facebook makes game streaming a first-year citizen. The ESRB adds new rating
18240	21960	information and Beat Saber works to keep you healthy. There's also speculation, sad news,
21960	25180	squabbles, and plenty more to discuss. So let's kick off episode two to the power of three
25180	28180	and four right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
28180	32180	Orange Lounge Radio
32180	36180	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where
36180	42020	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 816
42020	49620	of our show for this April the 19th of 2020. My name is Rob Roberts, joining you live and
49620	54340	here in our studio that usually we all gather live in, but due to the circumstances going
54340	58460	on in the real world right now, of course, we are recording over distance. So thanks
58460	62740	to the magic of Discord, I am joined by the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
62740	63740	Oh, hi.
63740	64740	Hi, how are you?
64740	73020	I'm doing all right. It's been a long day and a long week and the better times are ahead.
73020	82180	Well, let me be the first to say tonight. Happy birthday, DarkSakura. It is your birthday.
82180	86620	Yes, it is. And I am this many years old.
86620	88620	And she's holding up 21 fingers.
88620	97940	Oh, well, don't tell people where I got those hands from. Okay. But anyway, yeah, it's my
97940	106540	my birthday. I was squirted out a while ago. Wow. pain and general disappointment of the
106540	107540	world.
107900	113220	Well, congratulations on hitting a milestone. I know I know that birthdays during the pandemic
113220	116860	are a little because, you know, I've known quite a few people at this point who've who've
116860	121140	had birthdays, but hopefully you're able to kind of make the best of the situation and
121140	123780	you get a makeup birthday when this is all over.
123780	130760	I reckon so. And Phoenix7726 said happy 21st. Now you can have a drink. I've been day drinking
130760	134220	all day. I started 11.
134220	136300	What's your drink of choice today?
137060	146340	Well, a good friend who I think she's been on the show a long time ago, sent me a bottle
146340	153220	of Godiva chocolate liqueur, which I have just had the biggest craving for for like,
153220	159020	at least since I had better lung capacity. So maybe after I was first done with the actual
159020	166420	sick part of pneumonia. So, yeah, and I have my bottle and it makes me happy and I've been
166420	172500	pouring it in coffee and also some Kraken, which I'm not drinking anything right now.
172500	180700	I have one left of my Trader Joe's chocolate Botswin stout. So I'm going to have that tonight.
180700	185620	I should have brought the can to Frivolo and left it on your doorstep, but I took a nap.
186500	190180	I took a nap. I took a very important nap. Well, you know what? It'll just be one of
190180	191140	those things I'll have to do midweek.
191140	195860	You can work from home and tomorrow and just drop it off after the show. I got you.
195860	202580	I do. I do work from home right now. Yeah. And I'm very fortunate. I'm a big. Yeah. I know there's
202580	207340	a lot of just like instability with things going on out there. So I trust me. I'm very,
207340	209820	very thankful for the situation I'm given right now.
210140	215860	SSJ 100 Matt asked how the stout is and given that it's on one of my lists of favorites and
215860	221500	I will sometimes drink it over a Guinness. Yeah. It's pretty good. Ooh. Mel Chan 13 in
221500	226300	chat says I have a whiskey ginger lemonade. It is tasty. That sounds really good. It's very close.
226300	230980	You say ginger. My absolute favorite drink is a Moscow mule bonus points. If you can actually
230980	235380	serve it in the copper cup. So, uh, yeah, that kind of made me think of that. Cause it's,
235380	239460	I'm one of those girls that I get very expensive whiskey and I drink it neat.
240060	244500	All right. Well, we know what to get you for your birthday. So, so lately I've actually had to drink
244500	251060	whiskey and bourbon on the rocks just because it hits me so much faster. Um, now, uh, they're
251060	255340	saying in chat that you actually like your audio qualities actually sounds better tonight, but I
255340	260060	think that I don't think you've changed mics. I think that may be a side effect of your like
260060	265580	healthier than you've been in weeks. Right. Oh yeah, no. Um, I, my whole medication, uh,
265620	272140	like regimen has been, uh, bumped up quite a bit. I still, I still get a little short of breath,
272140	279020	but I feel like I've got better, better vocal capacity. Um, and uh, yeah, and I have been
279020	284220	drinking, so maybe that helped. That's right. And by the way, we are reading shout outs in
284220	287900	our chat room because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network,
287900	293660	twitch.tv slash vog network, V O G voice of geeks network. And we are on at six o'clock Pacific
293660	299740	nine o'clock Eastern ish right after the Bobby black Wolf show. And, uh, also speaking of voice
299740	307100	quality and I think improved voice quality, let's say hello to tech master Loki. Hello. Hi, how are
307100	312700	you? I'm fine. You sound much better. You do not sound like you're on a tin can anymore. This is
312700	319820	great. Well, that's because before I was on a webcam mic and now I'm on a rock band mic. I love
319820	325260	it. You are legit on a rocket for a PlayStation two, like USB mic. It was an X-Box three 60,
325260	329260	but yeah, it's the, the old logitech mic. So they used to actually, I don't even think this is from
329260	334060	rock band. I think this may be from karaoke revolution. Um, just had it leftover from all
334060	340220	that stuff, but Oh my, they're all compatible. Oh my God. I have one of those that, that sealed
340220	345660	karaoke revolution country. That's been sitting in the studio. Who knew there's a freaking mic
345660	350220	in there. Maybe that's how I fixed some that are watching on Twitch will notice I'm using a
350220	354620	different mic too, because I think, you know, we upgraded the mics in the studio a few months ago,
354620	358860	but I honestly think they've been causing more problems, which is unfortunate. So I'm actually
358860	362780	trying to switch mics tonight to try to get some of the popping, um, to calm down a little bit.
362780	367420	Maybe I need to switch to the fricking karaoke. I'm looking around, but they're all USB mics,
367420	371580	but they're not bad. And this one must be brand new because it's wrapped up nicely. The cord is
371580	375340	wrapped up neatly because whenever I rewrap that it's never going to be like that again.
375340	381100	So, um, yeah. Rob girl, you are not Alyssa Edwards. Stop the popping.
382700	389500	Oh, okay. Uh, let's see going to our chat. Uh, yeah, a lot of compliments on Loki sound tonight
389500	394060	and people are, are really hilariously digging the fact that you're using a rock band mic
394060	399420	and people's confessing. This is just, this is like a, it's a good entry-level podcast, Mike.
399420	403260	Maybe that's the advice we want to give to people that want to use this opportunity to start a
403260	408860	podcast, which unlike Twitter and people trying to be funny on Twitter who are not funny, ever
408860	414300	funny, uh, saying, Oh, please, whatever you do, don't start a podcast. Uh, to that, I say,
414300	420620	fuck that. I say, absolutely yes. Start a podcast, especially if you think you're the type of person
420620	424940	who shouldn't be podcasting and you probably are the type of person that should be podcasting.
425340	431260	And I think this is great advice. Dust off your rock band or karaoke, uh, karaoke revolution
431260	436140	microphones. And you've got a good starter kit right there. Uh, VGRealness when VGRealness did
436140	440940	a podcast, we did it with four separate rock and Mike and Mike's attached to a USB hub.
440940	447260	Uh, Bobby says my first podcast microphone was a karaoke microphone. Um, tiger class
447260	451180	says someday you'll get one of those mic holder things that you mount on a desk so that you don't
451180	456140	always have to hold it. Uh, yes, I want to get one of those like elaborate, like hook type things,
456140	460700	because the problem is I do have, we do have like a tiny baby stand. I had one sitting around here
460700	465180	cause, um, dark soccer was using it for like two weeks before this whole thing started. Um,
465180	470380	but it's too, it's, it confines like I would have to sit here and talk like this for the entire show
470380	474380	and it would be very awkward. So I need something that lets me move a little more naturally because
474380	480540	I think I paid five bucks for it. Yeah. I think granted when we are all in the same room, which
480540	484700	is how this podcast is intended to be, obviously we're not right now because of the state of the
484700	488460	world and setting a good example, but when we're in the same room, we'd like to kind of look at
488460	493820	each other and interact and play off each other and stuff. Um, and so I think movement is very
493820	499340	important and not, and that's why I've always been a big proponent of hand mics. Although most
499340	504700	podcasters would think I am nuts, but I'm like, there's positives and there's negatives. The
504700	509580	positive is I get an additional energy off being able to feed off my co-hosts that I think a lot
509580	513580	of people don't always get. So, and that's the type of stuff you have to weigh for what works
513580	520780	for you. So anyway, uh, tiger class says, have you thought of headset mics? Um, yes. Uh, in fact,
520780	526860	I think, aren't you using one right now? I am. I'm using my work mic. Um, not, I mean, it's,
526860	531740	it's one of those Jabra mics. They're not cheap. I mean, but I think it sounds okay. Sounds pretty
531740	536140	good. Honestly, in the perfect world, I'd have those little lavalier mics, just like they have
536140	541260	on, um, the nightly news or, you know, when you, uh, professional grade stuff that that's ideal
541260	546620	for me, honestly. So, um, who knows, maybe with enough biddies and subs, we'll get there. I'm just,
546620	550780	I'm teasing what, I'm not really going to beg for money. Although certainly we always welcome
550780	555020	that type of stuff. And it does go back to running the show and all that good stuff. But, um,
555020	559980	who knows? We'll see. Uh, the nice thing is, again, not that any of this going on in the
559980	564940	real world right now is nice, but if there is a silver lining, I don't know about you guys,
564940	571660	but I'm saving money because I'm not driving. Uh, I'm not going out to eat as much. I'm not like,
571660	576140	there's certain places where I'm like actually saving money. And again, I completely realize
576140	580860	there are other people right now that are in a very much financial hardship. So I don't want
580860	586540	to sound like I'm, I'm, uh, unaware of, of some of that privilege that I have with, with my work
586540	591580	situation, everything, but I am able to kind of like save money so I can hopefully maybe invest
591580	597340	in some of those things. So for what it's worth. So anyway, our gas bill though has been much
597340	603180	higher because Dan has been, well, he cooked the entire time that I've had pneumonia and since,
603180	608540	since I was still recovering. So yeah, that's, and yeah, Alan's been doing a lot of cooking around
608540	612540	here too. Like he made muffins the other day. That's never happened. So that's fun. So,
613100	617260	all right. Uh, anyhow, let's actually, we, we are a video game show, so let's get into talking about
617260	621260	some video games. Although this kickoff topic tonight is a little bit like video games are
621500	625900	like a part of it, but it does have to do with, um, somewhat kind of like our world situation
625900	630700	right now, where most of us are staying at home. In fact, everybody really should be staying at
630700	635500	home unless you are in a country that is somehow unaffected by this. But I think every country is
635500	639340	at this point. Um, so most people are staying at home so that they're not, you know, spreading the,
639340	642620	well, and you're not staying at home if you're an essential worker, that's, that's what I'm looking
642620	651500	for. Um, and so, um, many people are, um, trying to, you know, with the gym's clothes and, um,
651500	656860	other ways that maybe have been ways that you were getting fit before, maybe like walking to
656860	661100	a subway or walking to transit or a bus or something and back, maybe you're not doing
661100	666460	that as much anymore. Um, so you're looking for other ways to get, uh, fitness. And so video games
667420	673420	is a big kind of method for that for a lot of people. Uh, and, uh, kind of knowing that that
673420	679580	is the case, one big video game this week released a kind of fitness related song.
679580	684700	Uh, Beat Saber is the game. And of course, a lot of you guys know, Beat Saber is a hugely popular
684700	689580	VR game. It's almost in some ways, the, the flagship, the Wii Sports of VR, almost, I don't
689580	693420	know Half-Life, Alyx might be there soon, but I think a lot of people recognize Beat Saber as like
693420	699020	one of the VR games. And of course, Beat Saber is a music-based game and it's kind of a workout.
699020	702300	You know, when you're waving those hands around frantically and, you know, you're kind of trying
702300	707180	to dodge pillars in that game, so you're moving your whole body up, down, side, side, it can be
707180	713580	quite a bit of a workout. Well, uh, there was a new song released this week called Fitbit,
713580	719260	excuse me, Fitbeat, excuse me. It is a free official song and is going to help you get a
719260	722940	workout. And in fact, looking at the preview video, they're playing it an expert or whatever
723020	726860	the most hardcore mode is. And it looks like a heck of a workout. Luckily, I'm sure there's
726860	731660	easier modes that I could actually play. But the interesting thing about Fitbeat is that the song
731660	738220	is actually designed to, to give your body a workout. So it's designed with the step pattern.
738220	742700	I say step pattern because my mind goes to DDR, but you know, with the note pattern and that
742700	746460	in mind to really work your body out. And I thought that was kind of a neat
746460	751900	concept is that, you know, especially when you consider this particular show's roots in music
751900	756620	gaming and the fact that, you know, a lot of us back in the day in 2002, when we started,
756620	761260	we're using things like Dance Dance Revolution and Power Power Paradise, and, you know, those
761260	766540	types of games for fitness as well as fun. It's, it's kind of interesting that in this world
766540	771820	situation, we have Beat Saber is one option of many. We'll talk about some of those other
771820	776700	options in a minute. Beat Saber is kind of one option for people to stay fit. And now it's like,
776700	781340	not only is it just that you're playing the game to be fit, but this is designed with fitness in
781340	785980	mind. It's kind of like, uh, you guys remember Dance Dance Revolution on the PlayStation 2
785980	789980	had like a fitness mode, right? Did you guys ever use fitness mode to actually be fit?
791260	794140	Well, not to be fit just as a personal challenge. How so?
795660	798940	Just to keep up with it. Can I do this? Can I do this round?
799740	804060	Okay. Um, did you guys actually, let me, let me sidetrack a little bit. How,
804060	809020	you know, especially because if in a weird way, the DDR stuff is kind of older at this point,
809020	812620	right? Dance Dance Revolution and all that was, you know, 10 plus years ago when we were playing
812620	817740	that stuff on the PlayStation 2, what was the fitness mode and what was the fitness kind of
817740	826140	like in those games? It's similar to the arcade. Basically it calculates the number of steps that
826140	832060	you're taking based on the steps that are in the song and assigns it a calorie value based on that.
832060	837580	That's how the, um, like I think a, and I don't even know when they started, but with all the,
837660	844540	um, profiles and everything on there, they do calculate, uh, calorie burning in there as well,
844540	848060	based on the number of steps and difficulty of the song, right. And maybe beat him or something
848060	853660	like that. And it's super inaccurate. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's, it's a little bit rudimentary,
853660	858620	um, because it's, it's, I don't think it's taking into account height or weight or any of that when
858620	863420	it does the calorie calculation, does it? I think you can set it up online when you're
863500	868140	setting up your, your account, um, to actually put your height and weight in there, but yeah,
868140	872300	it's still pretty even, yeah. Even then, you know, everybody is different. So it's,
872300	877580	it's going to be an estimation at best. Um, lots of folks in chat lighting up on this topic,
877580	881500	uh, cause I know we have a lot of old school music game fans and chat, uh, pixel pocket says I've
881500	886860	been playing a ridiculous amount of DDR with my step mania stage. Uh, Mel Chan said, uh, I wanted
886860	890460	to get ring fit adventure, but it's gone through the roof price wise. We'll talk, come back and
890460	896060	talk about ring fit adventure in a bit. Uh, mr Rizzo's in chat, uh, says I'm still playing
896060	902540	just dance. So kind of like a cousin to DDR kind of like a modern, you know, day, uh, dance game.
902540	906940	Uh, obviously those games are still huge. I'm still playing just dance in sweat mode to try
906940	913340	to keep moving. You know, and I've seen tweets of even in this type of situation, I've saw tweets
913340	918220	of friends who are setting up their old school PlayStation two, or I think in this one case,
918220	924860	I saw an Xbox three 60 Matt with the universe games, um, setting that up on the wooden panels
924860	930460	to prevent the mats from bunching up and like, like this is my workout regime right now because
930460	934700	24 hour fitness is closed or whatever it is. Or, you know, I know a lot of people are still going
934700	939180	outside, which is, it's a good thing. Doctors recommend you should still be going outside for
939180	942300	30 minutes a day, just as long as you're maintaining social distance rules and everything
942300	948060	like that. But not everybody necessarily wants to run outside or, you know, exercise and sweat
948060	952700	and all that outside. Maybe, maybe going outside is literally just catching some sun and you want
952700	955980	to do the working out in the comfort of your own home. That's, you know, so a lot of people set up
955980	964060	those types of home gym types of setups and video games are a great way to do that. So, um, anyhow,
964060	969660	uh, continuing with the fit beat story, uh, if you want to grab this song, it is free. It's available
969660	976380	for PlayStation VR, as well as Oculus steam. Uh, it works with the one saber mode and 360 degree
976380	980300	modes in addition to the regular two saber. So they, they flushed out with all the different
980300	984860	modes that beat saber supports. Um, and I know when I've played beat saber on PlayStation VR,
984860	989260	where I own it, I get quite a bit of exercise from that game. So that is a good way, I think,
989260	994380	to get some exercise. I also really liked Otica, which is another music game. You don't flail quite
994380	998460	as much, but I think it's still a bit of workout and that's a really good one as well. Although,
998460	1005020	um, not everything has to be VR for exercise. Not everybody necessarily enjoys VR. Uh, some people
1005020	1010300	may find working out with that headset a little awkward. Um, so there's certainly other ways to
1010300	1015580	do it, such as we had just dance was mentioned, uh, old school DDR and those types of games
1015580	1020780	and ring fit adventure, uh, and SSJ 100 Matt and our chat at twitch.tv slash VOG network says,
1020780	1026140	I've been playing ring fit adventure since this whole thing started. I lost five pounds playing
1026140	1033260	it in the past 30 days and feeling stronger in my arms and legs. Still hate doing squats though,
1033340	1037660	but squats are awesome and Final Fantasy seven remake, just saying, anyway, um,
1038380	1044300	Bobby Blackwell says, Otica is arm day. Uh, Beat Saber does some leg day. Uh, Bobby says,
1044300	1049820	pull out your old Wii fit. Uh, and she hold 10 kind of, uh, piggybacks on that saying
1049820	1056060	we tennis. Absolutely. Uh, so there's all sorts of ways that people are using video games to stay
1056060	1060780	fit. I'm kind of curious for my co-hosts and that we've heard from some of the chatters,
1060780	1066300	but if you guys want to expand on that more, are you guys using video games at all to stay
1066300	1071260	fit and get X exercise during this? If so, like what is kind of your routine?
1073500	1079180	Um, well, I've been playing step mania on my arcade cabinet, so doing that a little bit.
1079820	1083100	Oh yeah. You're not as much, you're fortunate to have the whole stinking cabinet in your garage.
1083100	1089100	That's pretty good. Yeah. Not as much as I would like to be, but, um, easy myself back in there.
1089100	1094700	Nice. Uh, dark Sakura, I don't know if you have cause you've been kind of sick, but anything.
1094700	1101820	I've been a lot sick. Yeah. So I've done two things, Jack and shit. So, um, no plans
1101820	1106620	maybe now that you're feeling better. Well, I'm going to try to see if I have the lung
1106620	1115260	capacity to take an actual walk around my block tomorrow. But, um, you know, um, Dan and I talked
1115340	1122380	about busting out the dream cast for second, uh, for second mix, just kind of off hand. Um,
1123260	1127180	um, I'm kind of thinking I might do the DDR thing again, but just so far, I've just been doing,
1127180	1132700	um, standard exercise, uh, yoga while listening to, uh, my, uh, my favorite podcasts really.
1133900	1135660	Including orange sounds radio. I'm just kidding.
1138700	1143820	But I do subscribe to us. Okay. That's good. That's good. Um, go ahead.
1144460	1149020	Oh, but you know, if, if anyone wants to know what my favorite podcasts are to ask me later,
1149020	1155260	I will tell you, cause they're awesome people. Um, I will say the one answer that nobody said
1155260	1162460	yet, uh, is my good old GPS games. I use a lot when walking, um, Orna has been a big one lately,
1162460	1165980	just because that's kind of been the game of the moment. But also the nice thing about Orna
1165980	1172780	is that it's not tied to, um, pokey stops or, you know, certain areas specifically, uh, Jamie,
1172780	1177580	we can hear your keyboard, just, you know, um, that's all right. Uh, so it's not tied to like
1177580	1181980	specific places like pokey stops and gyms of monsters and those types of things and Orna
1181980	1187100	spawn everywhere. Um, so if I just kind of like walk around the block where there might not be
1187100	1191020	any pokey stops, I can still do something. So that's been a really good game for that.
1191020	1194940	Um, but I know a lot of people still play Pokemon go and I've played that too, because I might go
1194940	1201180	to the park and play that, um, Ingress, um, that the, the play in that has slowed down tremendously
1201180	1204620	because most people are kind of staying in their own neighborhoods. So it's kind of one of those,
1204620	1210300	I like to go walking at one of the local parks, but like, if my competition hasn't taken it over
1210300	1215180	for their team, they don't go there as much as I do. So I oftentimes go there and I have nothing
1215180	1220380	to do because it's still, uh, my team's color. So, but they took it today. So I need to go,
1220380	1224380	uh, take care of that tomorrow, but we'll see. But yeah, I mean, that's been a good way to just
1224380	1229340	get out, get some sun and so forth is the nice, uh, GPS gaming. So there's that as well. Um,
1230220	1235900	and I know Pokemon go, especially has really been trying to, uh, rely on the incense. Um,
1235900	1239980	so you can really make more Pokemon spawn, even if you're just sitting in place. I know they did
1239980	1245500	a big event today. I checked it out for a little bit, but I wasn't going to sit there for six hours
1245500	1250380	playing that rating at home stuff yet. I don't think they've actually turned it on yet.
1250380	1254620	I know they've announced it, but it's not turned on yet, but I would imagine that's coming in the
1254620	1259500	next week. Uh, or very, very soon. I think before community day, cause community day is being
1259500	1267340	advertised with that new raid pass. Uh, and I got a new gym right nearby. So obviously I have to
1267340	1273180	keep it vague cause I don't like giving my address away on air, but I got a second gym added within
1273180	1278540	my site, what I can see from the house. So that will be like, um, something I can use, uh, cause
1278540	1283820	it says you can rate anything in your nearby view. So that's kind of nice. Oh, that's cool. Yeah.
1283820	1288140	So, um, I wonder if I can hit the, hit the one for my part. Um, you might as well, if, if it
1288140	1293420	comes up in your nearby, if like an egg is on it, then it's something you'll be able to remote raid.
1293420	1298300	That is apparently what the rules are supposed to be. Um, as to 200, Matt and chat says, I have
1298300	1302220	still been playing Pokemon go during this whole thing. I just play late at night when not a lot
1302220	1306780	of people are around. And that's 200. Matt says, I forgot about the event. I think that might also
1306780	1311660	tie into Pokemon goes kind of event fatigue. They've they're almost doing so many events.
1311660	1316140	It's hard to keep track of them sometimes. And some of them just fall off the radar. Like I've,
1316140	1320700	I've kind of given up on tracking all the Pokemon go events. Like I just play when I want to play.
1321340	1326700	They're clearly not increasing the level cap anytime soon. I'll catch them all eventually.
1326700	1331580	So I've kind of, I've kind of turned into filthy casual when it comes to Pokemon go. And that is
1331580	1336940	a okay. So, all right. Well, anyhow, I don't think I've touched it in a while to be honest.
1336940	1341180	Well, Hey, you know, if you start going for more walks that might that or order or so whatever's
1341180	1345180	up your alley might be the type of thing. That's just a kind of something that motivates you to
1345180	1349420	take a few more steps. You know what I mean? Yeah. I just saw that we unlocked falling King
1349420	1354140	Arthas, but apparently I can't bite him yet. Yeah. I doubt anybody. Yeah.
1355100	1361180	Well, that's doing that. Yeah. I'll be honest now though, when I'm walking or something like that,
1361180	1367180	I don't want to be distracted by looking at my phone when I'm trying to enjoy the scenery around
1367180	1372460	me. I'm just saying that's fair. Um, you know, I, I think you can find a blend of both. I try to
1372460	1376460	try to have a little bit of both, especially if I'm playing around sunset. Um, I find that the
1376460	1380220	phone can motivate me to kind of keep out there and then, Oh yeah. It's kind of look up once in
1380220	1384940	a while, you know, especially, um, if I'm well, you know, before the pandemic started, uh, when
1384940	1389340	I was playing Ingress in new areas, then it was very encouraging to kind of like, Oh, I never
1389340	1392860	would have thought this was here before. And you kind of stopped to check out, uh, that world
1392860	1397100	around you. So it's, um, kind of cool. So, all right. Kind of, I thought it would be interesting
1397100	1401580	to kind of hear about some of these fitness type of ways that were, you know, still staying fit in
1401580	1407020	this particular circumstance. Um, especially, uh, with this Beat Saber track, uh, having come out
1407020	1411580	this week specifically about fitness, let's move on though, and talk about, uh, the types of games
1411580	1415580	that we have been playing this week, whether they're fit or otherwise, and how was your gaming
1415580	1420060	week? So dark Sakura, how was your gaming week? What do you been playing? Animal crossing.
1420060	1427580	Of course. How's that going to be my gaming week for the next two years. Okay. Yeah. Um, really,
1427580	1432780	um, we finally, you know, got the KK things to the end of the storyline. I never say it's the
1432780	1436700	end of the game because the game is always ongoing. Dan still has the 2 million bell
1436700	1444540	loan to pay off for his basement. Now you're in the end game. Um, the animal crossing end game,
1444540	1451420	five star rating and the stonk market stonks. I actually did buy my first, uh,
1451420	1457980	Torps for actual doing a stock market. Well, you've got that whole little Facebook group
1457980	1463180	to share prices. And I've been added to two different Facebook groups for animal crossing.
1463180	1469020	Uh, there's yours. Yeah. And there's another one I got added to as well. And, uh, it's just,
1469020	1472940	it's great for checking up on turnip prices and stuff. So I wonder how long that's going to go.
1473420	1477420	Well, mine hasn't really died down at all in livelihood either.
1477420	1481180	And we know one of the other fun things about it is that, um,
1482620	1488300	it actually has been growing by more people. Like when I started this, I started it with 10 people
1489100	1493900	and I was like, Hey, you can add a friend here and there and a friend here and there turned into,
1495420	1498620	I don't know how many people we have in there. I'd have to go look at the statistics again,
1499180	1505740	but that group is just really growing. And if you're on, um, on Facebook, I do keep my Facebook
1505740	1512300	very, very hidden. Um, so if you're not, you know, a mutual or something, um, if you're a mutual
1512300	1519580	reach out, let me know. Um, if you find me on, uh, Twitter, I might be able to get you
1519580	1524620	away into the group. So we'll see, but the group is doing pretty well. Um, and everyone's been
1524620	1529100	really forthcoming. No one's like, Hey, I'm selling this for 50 million bells. You have
1529100	1534140	to pay it up or nothing. You need to leave a 50,000 bell tip and there will be a bodyguard
1534140	1539660	there amongst the fence path to collect. I can't stand that side of the game. I'm sorry. Those are
1539660	1543420	the types of groups I don't want to be in. You know, the only thing that I do, if it's an
1543420	1550140	absolute stranger, I'll do a limited code. And I got the idea from somebody of, um,
1550140	1558220	uh, putting, uh, a booth, like one of those little stands in front of, um, where the, uh,
1558220	1564620	airport is so that they can't get past it. Although I did wall off most of my, uh, village
1564620	1570860	because, um, and I'm not, you know, I'm not mad about it, but I've been more cautious that, um,
1570860	1575420	one of my friends, um, husband was playing on her account while she was, you know, tending to their,
1575420	1583340	their two-year-old. And, um, he came and shot down a bunch of my bamboo. Oh, yikes. Okay.
1583980	1590620	Cause I had, I had, um, cause the character in as a best friend. Yeah. Yeah. Or just,
1590620	1594540	you just the normal friend opening. But if you're someone's in with a dodo code, then they can dig
1594540	1598940	up your flowers and all of that. And I normally, you know, I'm fine with it. Usually I'm like,
1598940	1603500	Hey, look, I have extra of these blue pansies and I've got purple pansies now for the record.
1603500	1609180	Um, yeah, yeah. Go ahead and dig yourself up too. You know, and they chopped down. I mean,
1609180	1614460	thankfully I had sprouts. I could, you know, I could regrow the bamboo. It was fine. But I was
1614460	1618540	like, Hey, just talk to your husband and tell him that ain't cool. And she's like, Oh, he didn't
1618540	1623820	know any better. He's sorry. He says he's sorry. I'm like, okay. But still, I, I actually now I
1623820	1629980	have a, we call it our gated community. Um, and I'm finally getting my 10th villager, but I have
1629980	1635260	the way I have it laid out is the fences go, and they're really unobtrusive until you actually try
1635260	1640940	to leave, to go across the bridge. My river is, you know, four spaces wide now, you know,
1640940	1647580	at that cutoff point. So I've got pads that end. So, um, I've really, uh, you know, it's kind of
1647580	1654780	like how you can like at Disneyland, how they redo the chains to reform the Cuba reroute that I live
1654780	1660860	in Disneyland now. See, I just, I just wouldn't invite anyone. I didn't trust to not screw up my
1660860	1664460	town. Like, and you know, unless you put them on your best friends list, they can't, and you know,
1664460	1668620	you're not, you're just not going to be able to a hundred percent prevent the, like the, the husband
1668620	1671900	signing on the wife's account or whatever that whole thing, like, you're not going to be able to
1671900	1674780	a hundred percent stamp that out. Those types of issues are going to happen, but I just wouldn't
1674780	1679100	invite anyone in my town that I didn't trust to like, go to nooks, do your thing, please don't
1679100	1682460	run through the flowers, but if they run through flowers and they don't run through flowers,
1683260	1686700	but if they run through flowers and they grow back in two days, they're just going to irritate me.
1686700	1690460	Yeah. It doesn't destroy the flowers. Yeah. It's not like it wasn't the older games. Like,
1690460	1694460	as long as you don't add them to your best friends list, they're really limited on what they can do.
1695180	1700780	Well, the thing that I'm really doing is I'm trying to still encourage that open trade in the,
1700780	1706620	uh, in the community. So like today I walled off my sections and I stuck down my happy birthday
1706620	1710700	sign, which there'll be pictures up on my Instagram. That's, uh, double to no Shema,
1710700	1718620	uh, you know, double to underscore no underscore Shema. Um, and, uh, I, uh, you know, I had like
1718620	1722620	a little birthday party and everything that Agnes threw for me who I'm actually liking Agnes,
1722620	1728060	even though I call her a, you know, a bitch whenever I'm looking for. Um, but I had it to
1728060	1734300	where people could go visit my villagers. They can go to my stores, they could go in my museum,
1734300	1738700	you know, I can do little pictures and everything. I had my happy birthday sign it and a cake and
1738700	1743420	everything out. And I sat in the director's chair and, you know, and, you know, had a held
1743420	1751260	court PRI outfit. Cause it'll have enough bells for the crown. Um, and so, um, and you and Dan
1751260	1756780	and I last night, you know, we'll more like up to two in the morning. We, since I got terraforming,
1756780	1761420	we, you know, redid the grounds and we move things around and we just had a great time, you know,
1761420	1766380	it's been something, and I'm surprised that Dan has gotten as into it as he has. Um, but it's
1766460	1771100	something that he and I can do together. Um, and for the record, we do have a final fantasy
1771100	1777900	seven remake, but we haven't been so inclined to play it. Not yet. Interesting. Just cause you're
1777900	1783340	just so into animal crossing. Oh, that too. And it's just like, when we're not doing animal
1783340	1787740	crossing, we're watching our normal, you know, YouTube channels that we like to watch. Like we
1787740	1794060	like the, uh, the four levels of chef videos and we like the gourmet recreates videos and we like
1794140	1797420	binging with Babish. So you're just, you're just not in a rush to get to it. You'll get to it when
1797420	1802220	you get to it. Yeah. Retro core. That's another one. And we've also played a little bit of pinball
1802220	1806220	together. It's going to be two years before the next episode comes out anyway. So, I mean,
1806220	1812700	it's not a big deal. I don't think. No. Yeah. So yeah, we've got time. I'm cool with it. Cool.
1812700	1817020	All right. Well, um, by the way, I don't think you heard the end of Bobby's show because he was
1817020	1821580	telling a story, uh, that would have piqued your interest. Now I would encourage everybody to
1821580	1825420	listen to the Bobby Black Wolf show. Uh, but I will, I will summarize his story.
1825420	1830540	So Bobby has been trying to get one specific villager to come to his island and it's the
1830540	1834540	villager everybody wants. It's Oddie, right? The, the one named after the grandmother,
1834540	1840460	um, that played. So he's been using, um, Nook Miles tickets to go talk to, uh, all those,
1840460	1844700	you know, villagers that hang out on the island, right? Because when you have an open house,
1844700	1849900	uh, there will be villagers on the Nook Miles Island. Uh, like I just got boomer, uh, yesterday.
1849900	1853900	So I finally have a penguin in my town for the first time ever in all of my Animal Crossing
1853900	1858060	history. I finally have a fricking penguin in my town. Thank you very much. Um, but you can
1858060	1862460	talk to them and they'll, they'll move into the empty house if you want them to. Well, he went to
1862460	1869900	an island and he realized that he was fishing up nothing but garbage. He was on garbage Island and
1869900	1875900	Jamie, guess what villager was living on garbage Island? I think I know. Yeah. If you look to chat,
1875900	1882700	you probably know it was Ed. Ed, Ed lives on garbage Island. Ed is full of garbage.
1883340	1888940	I ran into Ed at somebody's, somebody else's, uh, town and I wish he'd been outside because
1888940	1893660	I would have beaten him to shit with a bug net or, or tried to ax him or something.
1893660	1897180	My friend that I visited the other day had Dina and I thought of you. Um,
1897180	1901660	she gave me a recipe. She was very nice. You know what? I have the card for Dina.
1902620	1909100	I'm getting a spare Dina of which when it arrives, I'm giving it to you. Oh, um,
1910060	1914700	I I've already given out my other spare cards except some of my specials,
1914700	1921580	but I discovered something as well. I have one Sanrio card. I have the 12 card,
1921580	1927900	which is the, the, the little twin stars. And I got it because I wanted, um, I was going to do,
1928860	1935260	the, uh, amiibo thing on new leaf. Um, and I wanted a 12, you know, the little twin star set
1935260	1940860	and it never did it. And when I saw that you can use the little twin stars amiibo cards,
1940860	1946460	I was like, Oh shit. And I found where my card went. And so what happens is that if you've got
1946460	1950220	villagers that you want to summon from amiibo cards that you can't thumb and like,
1950220	1954780	you can't bring in at 12 and you can't do Digby or reset or any of those, you know,
1955660	1962460	when you still scan the amiibo card, you, when you get back on your, uh, your nook
1962460	1966700	kiosk thing, when you go into do a special order, you now have a place for posters.
1968060	1972140	Yep. So I have a little twin stars poster.
1972140	1975500	That's awesome. See, okay. We need to do a little amiibo trading that I don't know.
1975500	1979740	Maybe I have some figures you don't have. Cause I I'm obsessed with those little posters. I
1979740	1983100	have a room that has a bunch of them in it. Um, so I have like those little,
1983100	1988220	those little goats that are friends. I have them cause some of them form like super posters.
1988220	1992540	So you there there's, um, use the Tom Nook amiibo and then the Timmy and Tommy amiibo.
1992540	1996140	And it's three posters and they go together to form like a super poster.
1996140	2000380	It's really, I need to put it back in cause I have the Timmy and Nook and I need to rescan
2000380	2008700	my Nooklings for Tommy. Um, but right now, um, I have a reset poster in my house. I have a DJ
2008700	2013100	KK downstairs. I have, you know, my regular KK and I have my little, and it actually,
2013100	2019660	the little twin stars one is Timmy and Tommy as a Kiki Lala and Rob, I will absolutely order you
2019660	2025980	a poster tomorrow. Um, I think I used up my, my orders, but I'm also willing to say that if any
2025980	2034220	of our listeners, you know, if you want a Kiki Lala poster over, I'll say the next two weeks,
2034220	2041980	I will give out four of them and you have to message me on Twitter and we'll, we'll work out
2041980	2048220	the code or the dodo code or whatever. And you can't give out that code to anybody, but I will,
2048220	2053500	I will make sure that you get a Kiki Lala poster or one of Timmy and Tommy is Kiki Lala.
2053500	2059660	Fun. All right. All right. Well, let's move on. I think we've talked a lot of animal crossing,
2059660	2063500	but I know it's, it's, it's not enough. You can't get away from it. It's everywhere.
2063500	2066860	Anyway. Uh, Loki, maybe, maybe your week was filled with animal crossing too. I don't know.
2066860	2071020	How was your gaming week? No, I have still not touched animal crossing, unfortunately,
2071020	2075980	even though I have it. Um, no, this week was pretty much just step mania. I've been,
2075980	2082060	you know, still trying to curate my, uh, song list and keep adding to it. They have too many
2082060	2086940	songs in there. And so right now, mainly just trying to get the repeats out of there and,
2087020	2093580	um, trying to take out stuff that's just ridiculously, like irritating or just,
2093580	2099100	you know, uh, the steps are ridiculous on them. Um, cause going through his stuff,
2099100	2103660	there's a lot of, I know like folks love doing like step files for anime music. And
2104700	2112780	I mean, it's fine, but like when you have like 500 songs of like various anime tracks
2112780	2118940	for animes I've never seen, like that's too much or like even like hardcore techno or,
2118940	2124620	and you, uh, rave music and stuff. It's like, okay. It's just so much of it just sounds the
2124620	2131260	same. Like I need to whittle down some of that stuff so that it's not so crazy. Um,
2132540	2137980	so yeah, so I've been doing that, um, and actually playing some of it as well. Um,
2138700	2144220	and then aside from step mania, I've been playing a little bit of stuff on my PC. So I played
2144220	2149500	Minecraft this week as well. Uh, we were playing with my kids this morning and so I have a realm,
2149500	2155580	it's kind of like a server, um, that we all play as a family. And so they wanted to go
2155580	2160380	kill the other dragon. So we found the, uh, fortress and, or I'm sorry. Yeah,
2160380	2165580	I think it's a stronghold. And we went to the end and, uh, killed the under dragon as a family.
2165580	2170540	So that was kind of fun. And then, uh, what else? Uh, look played a little bit of earth
2170540	2176780	defense force, iron rain, uh, because I picked that up on a steam sale at some point. And so,
2176780	2181820	uh, of course, you know, I love my earth defense force games and that one's kind of ridiculous as
2181820	2186940	well, but it's, it's a fancier looking earth defense force. So, um, I like that. The only
2186940	2191660	thing I didn't quite care for is a lot of those games are kind of shoddily put together. So
2192620	2199340	for whatever reason, it like, it really wants to play on my laptop monitor, which I have two
2199340	2204540	dedicated monitors, you know, at my desk and it's just trying to play on the side here.
2204540	2209020	So I have to disable my laptop, uh, display in order for it to play on the right screen,
2209020	2215180	which is stupid. Absolutely dumb, but it's earth defense force. So what are you going to do?
2216620	2220140	So that's pretty much it. All right. Sounds like you've had a pretty, pretty busy week.
2220140	2224140	I love that story of killing the ender dragon as a family. That's adorable.
2224140	2229100	Uh, some people play board games, your family kills dragons. That's cool. Uh, so, uh, my gaming
2229100	2233180	week. So yeah, I've had some time to play video games. Um, so I'm still playing a lot of final
2233180	2238140	fantasy 14, cause that's my MMO time seek of choice. Um, and I've also been playing animal
2238140	2242700	crossing, just like dark Sakura, probably not as much as star Sakura. Although I also,
2242700	2247180	today was my KK to concert actually this morning when I signed in to get the turnips,
2247180	2251340	I got the KK concert, which is when the credits roll. So does that mean I beat animal crossing?
2251340	2255180	Can I count that as IB animal crossing for the year? Cause you finished the storyline.
2255180	2258780	Okay. Like, like you were saying, you're now in end game. I'm in the end game now. Yeah,
2258780	2261980	no, but I I've been, uh, I've been getting a little more into the gardening thing. So I'm
2261980	2266380	starting to collect the flowers. Like you brought me like blue pansies, I think. And so I've been
2266380	2270300	trying to set up those efficient cross breeding gardens. You've probably seen some of the pictures
2270300	2275420	floating around out there. Um, so, and I, I have a cute little area. I've been really into
2275420	2280540	customizing the things I build. Like I did not realize like, Oh, not only can you build a
2280540	2283900	fountain, but you can paint it black. And I was like, Ooh, so I set up this whole little like
2283900	2287900	garden and I love it. So, um, yeah, you'll have to, you'll have to come see what I did dark Sakura.
2287900	2292060	Cause I kind of changed a lot in that. And I finally got able sisters, which I know you
2292060	2298460	were looking for last time. So, uh, that is there. Hey, if, if during your lunch tomorrow, cause I,
2298460	2302380	I had already taken two days off for my birthday because I was supposed to be in San Francisco,
2302380	2311260	but no disease. Thank you dump anyway. Um, but, um, tomorrow we'll have to, um, to do some cross
2311260	2315500	visiting so that we can see each other's new changes. Cause like I said, I've done a lot of
2315500	2320060	work in my town. Yeah. So, and then I built himself a redneck paradise. I just unlocked
2320060	2325180	all that terraforming. So now, and now I'm, I had like 40,000 miles in storage cause I never go to
2325180	2329100	the islands. So like, I'm like, Oh, I'm buying that. I'm buying that. I'm buying that. So yeah,
2329340	2334460	you'll have to see anyway. Um, I also, I keep thinking I'm going to do a stream on my personal
2334460	2338860	channel and I will get to it. Here's what's kind of been slowing me down on streaming on my
2338860	2345660	personal channel. I've actually had to use some of the equipment to set up my work stuff on my,
2345660	2351020	in my personal office. Some of like the splitters and HDMI cables and stuff are actually making me
2351020	2355260	able to work in my office. So if you're wondering like why I haven't streamed in a long time,
2355260	2359020	that is a big part of the reason, but I need to just fix all that. Cause I really want to do
2359020	2363500	like a stream where I visit people's animal crossing towns, uh, and, uh, hit their villagers
2363500	2369100	with bug nets. No, I'm kidding. I'll be respectful. It'd be fun. So, uh, yeah. Um, there's that. So,
2369100	2374060	uh, I, I've been making progress in animal crossing, which is cool. I've also been playing
2374060	2380620	a crap ton of final fantasy seven remake. Still haven't beaten it yet, but I'm at least 20 hours
2380620	2389660	in I'm thinking beyond that. And I am in chapter 13, 14, maybe I don't, I just opened up a lot of
2389660	2394780	sub quests and that is probably what I can say without spoiling. Cause obviously I'm not going
2394780	2399420	to be that guy who spoils, uh, how can you spoil a game that is so many years old and just being
2399420	2404460	remade because, and I said this last week and I'll say it again because not enough people understand
2404460	2411820	this final fantasy seven remake is not the same story. I mean, it kinda, it's the same plot.
2411820	2417660	It's the same characters, but they've changed quite a bit. And so if you're again going,
2417660	2422380	well, I'm not going to play a game. That's only a quarter of the experience. You're wrong.
2424140	2428140	It's it's it's you're, you're thinking of it, not the right, you're not putting it in the right
2428140	2435100	framing because it's not a one for one remake of the original whatsoever. It is completely a new,
2435100	2438540	uh, plot because they have fleshed things out and all that good stuff are really good.
2438540	2443100	So I was making comparisons on last week's show and a really good one came up on Bobby
2443100	2447420	Black Wolf show from pod culture. And I think this is the best comparison I've heard yet.
2448060	2454380	It's the battle star Galactica 70 series and the battle star Galactica reboot series.
2455180	2459420	They're different. There's a lot of similarities, a lot, a lot of similar characters, a lot of
2459420	2464140	things, but a lot's changed for one. The special effects are much better in the newer version.
2465020	2470700	So I think that was a really, really good, um, comparison. Um, Tiger claw and chat says,
2470700	2475820	does a certain character meet the same fate? Um, I don't know yet because it has not been addressed
2475820	2480780	in the story. And even if I did know, I was not, I would never spoil for the listeners and, uh,
2480780	2485260	we'll, we'll, we'll find out, uh, play the game and find out. And maybe in six months,
2485260	2489340	we can talk a little more openly about it when, uh, enough people have played it at this point.
2489340	2496300	Um, let's see, um, going to chat for some other comments, uh, Phoenix 77 26 says,
2496300	2500460	I wonder if they will make certain decisions in that game again, or if certain party members will
2500460	2505100	stay until the end, Rob, I don't know. It depends. It depends. I don't know what they're going to do
2505100	2510700	for the future episodes. Um, because there's really only four playable characters in this game.
2511260	2515340	Um, and so I don't know what's going to happen when you open up things like Vincent Yuffie and,
2515340	2520300	uh, Sid and like all the characters you get later on. Oh yeah. And that was, that was the thing too,
2520300	2527820	is member. You could also get you earlier in the game, um, in Midgar actually in the original that
2527820	2534940	is rare to do that, but you could do it. Yeah. So I, the answer, the answer is I don't know. And I,
2534940	2540780	again, I think it is incorrect to assume because anything happened in the original,
2540780	2545020	it's going to happen the same way in this one. This game makes it very clear. They're not going
2545020	2550300	to follow the exact same script. Um, so they're going to do their own thing. So we, we, we really
2550300	2554140	don't know. So what's going to happen in that department. Uh, maybe there'll be new characters
2554140	2561500	you can play. Who knows? Um, I, uh, what, what, Oh, I will say this. So, um, they've said openly,
2561500	2569020	you know, you know, you can play Aerith Barrett, uh, Tifa cloud, and then red 13 is there,
2569020	2573820	but you, he's a guest character. They've said that in pre-release interviews. I'm not like spoiling
2573820	2578060	anything. They haven't talked about openly the official staff before the game came out. It's
2578060	2582860	pretty limited to those characters. However, another character, and this is the part I am
2582860	2587660	going to leave vague, did show up in a cut scene. And I was like, like, I was like, I,
2587660	2592140	I was not expecting to see that. And it was, it was, it was like a blink and you'll miss it thing.
2592140	2598300	And I was like, that's, that's, and that was it. So, uh, there's, and I don't think in the
2598300	2603580	original, the character was in the Midgar part of the story. So I'm there's again,
2603580	2609900	they're doing their own thing and I think it's great. So, um, Phoenix 77 26 says, Rob,
2609900	2613580	do we know when the next episode is coming out? No, we don't. And we don't even know if they're
2613580	2620380	calling it an episode. They're going to do their own thing and that's fine. So, um, anyhow, so
2620380	2625900	that's enough on Final Fantasy 7 Remake. I'm, I'm still loving it. Um, oh no, I should say one other
2625900	2630460	thing because I think now some things where I could see like some criticisms of the game,
2630460	2638540	um, not so much the story, but I did notice in playing chapters 10 and 11, some of it started
2638540	2643100	to feel, and Alan was actually watching me play because, um, Alan wanted to see a certain sequence
2643100	2647660	that happened in the game. And then it led into chapters 10 and 11. And even he had kind of
2647660	2651500	commented like, this is getting to be a little like these maps are getting a little long. Like
2651500	2656220	these, this is getting a little samey what you're doing. And I would say it was starting to get
2656220	2660700	luckily the game picked up again, but it was starting to feel a little bit grindy and a little
2660700	2665580	bit like, okay, this is getting a little like, yeah. Um, and then the other thing I think is
2665580	2669180	that really needs to be brought up about Final Fantasy 7 Remake is that
2670140	2674940	a lot of people that are praising Final Fantasy 7 Remake, and I'm not saying Final Fantasy 7 Remake
2674940	2679900	isn't deserving of lots of praise. I'm praising it. It's a great game, but it is fascinating to
2679900	2686860	me. How many people are praising 7 Remake who completely took a shit on Final Fantasy 13?
2688300	2695020	Because I'm gonna tell you what, Final Fantasy 7 Remake almost has just as much in common
2695020	2702380	with Final Fantasy 13 as it does with Final Fantasy 7. You'll see what I mean when you get
2702380	2708860	around to playing it. But part of it is some of the maps do get kind of linear, except you might
2708860	2713420	have a little branching path that takes you to a treasure chest. But like, I'm kind of surprised.
2713420	2719660	And again, it didn't bother me in 13, because I still felt like there was enough like progression.
2719660	2722860	There was enough where it kind of fit the narrative and the story they were trying to tell
2722860	2728860	like the the linearity in Final Fantasy 13 didn't really bother me. But I want to be clear,
2728860	2735100	it's no better in Final Fantasy 7 Remake. So it's interesting to me how people that were really
2735100	2740620	bothered by... I really think if you play Final Fantasy 7 Remake and you finish it and all that
2740620	2745980	stuff, you should go back and play Final Fantasy 13 and reevaluate some of your feelings on Final
2745980	2751660	Fantasy 13. Because I think that game, I think time will treat that game more favorably than
2751660	2755980	what it got when it first came out. I think as people go back and play it again. That whole
2755980	2762540	stagger mechanic that's in Final Fantasy 7 Remake, guess what game that came from? 13. So, you know,
2762540	2767420	put some put some respect on Final Fantasy 13's name. That's what I'm saying. And what a perfect
2767420	2772620	time to re-release the trilogy, although I don't think Square Enix has any plans to. But if I
2772620	2780940	remember right, at the end of last year, Microsoft said at least 13 would be coming to Game Pass at
2780940	2785020	some point. I don't know about 13 to enlightening returns. I can't recall if that was included.
2785740	2791180	But we should be seeing at some point 13 hit Microsoft Game Pass. So if you happen to have
2791180	2796780	that, what a great opportunity to revisit, hopefully coming soon. I don't know. We'll see.
2798220	2802300	So some comments in chat because I knew my hot take would get some comments here in chat.
2802860	2808540	Bobby Blackwell says, it's very corridor heavy. I enjoyed 13. Akuma JP says, nope, Rob, you're
2808540	2814940	wrong. How dare you? Final Fantasy 13 has shitty story. Final Fantasy 13 battle is shitty without
2814940	2820220	materia. Final Fantasy 13 has shitty dialogue. Final Fantasy 13 says has shitty character
2820220	2826860	except lightning. But Final Fantasy 13 also has a decent ending. And I don't know if I
2826860	2831820	necessarily agree. I enjoyed the battles, to be honest. I don't. Yeah. So anyway.
2832780	2838780	VG Realness says, I never understood why people complain about Final Fantasy games being linear.
2838780	2844300	They always were. I know I personally dislike 13 for other reasons. And that's fine. Again,
2844300	2849820	people can have their own opinions on games. It's fine. But it's just interesting to me sometimes
2849820	2854460	how the criteria here doesn't match the criteria here all the time. But that's fine. If you didn't
2854460	2859500	like the story and you didn't like the characters, I don't think I can like change your mind on that.
2859660	2864380	That's just one of those things that's open to interpretation like any movie or book or what
2864380	2867820	have you. It's just going to click for some people. It's not going to click for other people.
2867820	2873820	And I will say Final Fantasy 13 did get a little alphabet soupy with some of their,
2873820	2879980	like the lacy and the falcie. And it did get a little, okay, I'll give you that. It got a
2879980	2886540	little crazy with all that stuff. So it's fine. VG Realness says, I mean, name a Final Fantasy
2886540	2893180	game prior to 15 that was not linear. 14 and 11, the MMOs. Okay. If I can't count those though,
2893180	2896380	yeah, no. I mean, even go back to the very first Final Fantasy. You're right.
2897020	2902380	A lot of that game's design is very gated. It's like you have this part of the map and then you're
2902380	2905740	going to go to this dungeon and get the dynamite that opens this part of the map. And then you're
2905740	2909100	going to go to this dungeon and get the canoe that opens this part of the map. And then you're going
2909100	2912060	to go get the boat that opens this part of the map. And then the airship that opens this part
2912060	2915740	of that. You're right. Final Fantasy games have kind of been linear in design for a very long
2915740	2923660	time. So VG Realness says about the MMOs, they don't count. Don't get cute. I can't help it.
2923660	2928700	I was born cute. All right. That's enough of my gaming week. Uh, let's talk about some other stuff
2928700	2934060	like what's going on in the news. So, uh, Loki, if you didn't fall asleep during my rants,
2934060	2940300	why don't you start us off with some gaming news? Um, so like this isn't a really big surprise,
2940380	2944860	but apparently, uh, Sony is, they're saying they're going to be making fewer PlayStation
2944860	2952140	fives this year. Um, due to its price, basically, um, you know, the thought is that a lot of these
2952140	2956060	consoles might be a little bit behind in production because of the whole COVID-19 thing
2956060	2960460	and folks not being able to return to work and that kind of stuff. But apparently they're saying
2960460	2968700	that, um, they're expecting that the pricing of course is going to be a factor in, um, not being
2968700	2972940	able to manufacture these units. I'm guessing maybe because the longer that they wait or because
2972940	2977660	production right now is impacted by that, there's high prices for that stuff. We don't even really
2977660	2983100	know what the price of the console is going to be yet, but we'll have to see. Um, right now they're
2983660	2987820	been telling their partners that they're going to make between five to 6 million PlayStation fives
2987820	2993980	during the financial year, which is, I mean, uh, March 31st of next year. And apparently they've
2993980	2999020	sold of course more than that for like PlayStation three and four and stuff within the first two
2999020	3007820	quarters. So, um, I don't know. I mean, I think a lot of these stories seem to be just, let's
3007820	3012860	speculate on stuff because we got nothing to go with. Cause it's slow. No, I think there is
3012860	3017020	definitely some of that coming into play, but I think, I think like, I think people are already
3017020	3022460	concerned about how might the COVID situation and how it impacts the various factories and all
3022460	3026460	these different countries that produce products. How is that going to ultimately play out in the
3026460	3030940	situation? But I think it's interesting about this. Um, buzz, if you, I don't know what else
3030940	3035500	to call it a rumors, you know, what have you, uh, admittedly, uh, what's interesting about it is
3035500	3039180	that they aren't really blaming the COVID situation, but they're saying because these,
3039180	3043820	these parts are still very expensive and they're not projected to come down in price for a little
3043820	3049420	bit. Uh, Sony is like, kind of like purposefully making less of it. So that way it doesn't feel
3049420	3053500	like they're like, like the store shelves are full of them and it's not selling well, I guess
3053500	3056540	that's kind of what I'm reading. I don't think it's necessarily that they're saying that
3056540	3060620	basically certain components are scarce and expensive, which would cut into the company's
3060620	3066460	profits. So they're basically holding back on producing a large number of these right now,
3066460	3072300	while the component pricing is high and waiting to produce more, once all that stuff settles down
3072300	3076780	and everybody's back to work and then all the pricing will come down. Yeah. And I was to say
3076780	3081340	that would make more sense is that during this COVID situation, like, you know, technology gets
3081340	3085420	cheaper and cheaper and cheaper is the usual trajectory. Right. But during this situation,
3085420	3090060	that's probably not happening. And so maybe that's kind of throwing off Sony's patterns as to
3090060	3093820	how much money are we going to make off this console and when, and all that stuff,
3093820	3098140	um, as Joanna. No, go ahead. I was going to say, and we have to even see when it's going to come
3098140	3103180	out because right now we're targeting the end of the year, but I mean, there's no, that's not set
3103180	3108780	in stone. So we'll have to see. Absolutely. I mean, depending on how this whole COVID stuff
3108780	3114140	plays out, which we just don't know, you know, especially if the recent wave of, you know,
3114140	3118700	and again, I'm, I'm really trying not to go there on the show, but this, it is the reality and could
3118700	3123740	have an effect on games and stuff. But if this recent wave of people clearly not giving a fuck
3123740	3129260	anymore and just wanting to go out in mass and like, you know, I would rather make money, uh,
3129340	3136300	for my boss than, uh, be healthy and all this stuff. If this plays into this situation,
3136300	3141820	just getting drawn out longer, uh, because a second wave ends up happening, like what happened,
3141820	3149020	uh, in the 19 hundreds with that flu pandemic, um, then maybe we're not going to see this end
3149020	3153260	by September or October, which is when you would expect a new console to come out.
3154140	3157980	Well, also something to add with that too. I'm glad that you brought that up because with these,
3157980	3165340	uh, I'm just going to say it with these absolute idiots. I hate using the word, but they're
3165340	3172220	idiots. Um, people who are trying to protest about going back to work, um, they don't seem to realize
3172220	3177500	that yes, in 1918, when they, uh, during the height of the Spanish flu, when, um, after the
3177500	3182220	end of world war, world war one, yeah. When, um, you know, the rates were going down, people were
3182220	3187740	getting better. The moment they had a big massive celebration for the end of world war one,
3187740	3193260	guess what happened? The pandemic spiked even higher than it did before resulting in,
3194060	3199100	I would, I think it was like another 20% more deaths than the first spike had cost.
3200860	3206220	Yeah. And it's just, I, I, I understand, like, I understand the frustrations where people like,
3206220	3210540	you know, are like, they're not able to work right now, you know, especially in people that are in
3210540	3215740	like the bar industry or the entertainment or the, you know, um, live concert type of experience
3215740	3219980	stuff. Uh, you know, these people are not able to work right now and I understand those frustrations,
3219980	3224620	but at the same time, I don't, for me, and I guess now this is a political issue,
3224620	3230780	which is so weird to think, cause I didn't think this should be, but clearly, but like,
3230780	3234300	instead of begging to go back to work and expose all these people to this,
3234300	3239180	why aren't we protesting that the government should be providing for us?
3239180	3243420	Exactly. Well, and that should be the protest, shouldn't it? I don't know. This is weird.
3244140	3247340	One thing that I tried to tell my mom too, is she's like, Oh, you know,
3247340	3251340	she's one of those good old days, kind of, Oh, the fifties, blah, blah, blah, you know?
3251900	3257180	And she doesn't like when I point out to her the tax rates that we were, that, that America
3257180	3263500	in general had in the fifties and that we were coming right out of FDR's new deal. He's like,
3263500	3268140	Oh, but, but the last two months, you can't say that you want things to go back to the
3268140	3274940	prosperity that we had before yet vote against the things that made us have that prosperity before.
3276620	3280060	Yeah. You cut out there. Did you have anything else?
3280940	3281660	Um, no.
3281660	3286140	Okay. Sorry. Um, so, um, anyway, I, sorry, I didn't mean to get tangenty,
3286140	3289500	but it's going to happen with everything that's going on in the world. Sorry. But I mean,
3289500	3295340	and like I said, it could affect all of this because if we, if we do not succeed in eradicating
3295340	3300700	this or minimizing it to a traceable testable thing that's controlled, let's say, uh, within
3300700	3304940	the next couple of months, then we could be looking at things in the fall, get pushed back
3304940	3308860	to, and we don't get new game consoles because you know, companies don't want to risk that type
3308860	3312940	of financial state or whatever. Um, because that should not be the type of stuff that we're rushing
3312940	3318220	to target to get. Uh, as somebody is pointing out in chat, Phoenix 77 26 says, I get those,
3318220	3322140	but then you have asses whining about how they can't get fertilizer for their hobby garden,
3322140	3326300	or can't get their hair cut or some ass, nine shit like that. And that's, that's the thing is
3326300	3332380	that, you know, essential means essential, right? So, um, video game consoles, I'm sorry,
3332380	3337820	they're not, they're not essential. You probably have a gigantic backlog of games on steam and so
3337820	3342300	forth. Um, or you know what, let me, let me introduce you to a fantastic website. It's called
3342300	3351500	itch.io and games as far as the eye can see low cost and free that will keep you busy for the next
3351500	3358540	10 years if you want it to, uh, even that might remind everybody that Ludum Dari is this weekend
3358540	3362700	as well. There is going to be literally hundreds of games available for you to play. And plus all
3362700	3367740	those other game jam games from previous tons of game jams all the time, free games all around.
3368300	3373820	Yeah. So we don't, we don't need a PlayStation five this year. Sure. It would be nice as a
3373820	3379340	gaming fan. I would welcome that, but I understand there's a lot of crazy shit going on in the world
3379340	3384860	right now. And if the PlayStation five doesn't happen as a result this year, I'll be okay. I,
3384860	3392860	I got food and water. I'll be okay. So it's yeah. Anyway, we'll see, we'll see what happens though,
3392860	3399260	as, um, you know, the, the, the weeks and so forth continue. And, uh, especially if Sony is kind of
3399260	3403820	running up against the clock to maybe announce some of this stuff, a lot of folks expecting
3403820	3409420	that Sony would announce things in a June timeframe because June would have been E3.
3409420	3414620	June is typically the month when these things are unveiled. Although I suppose if Sony shown
3414620	3418540	anything in the past couple of years, it is that they're going to do whatever the fuck they want
3418540	3424460	and they're going to do it on their timetable. So, um, do we expect a Loki or dark side? Do we
3424460	3428620	expect Sony to make an announcement in June or, or do we think that doesn't even happen at this
3428620	3433900	point? Um, it, I think it's going to happen at some point they're going to have some sort of
3433900	3438540	announcements, but yeah, a lot of these, they don't really seem to have much of a digital
3439580	3445500	plan for, um, well, aside from what IGN is supposed to be doing for that, but like,
3445500	3449340	there's not really anything been announced yet for that. And I don't know if they're in a big
3449340	3456220	hurry to do that. Um, I don't know. I hope we get some announcements. I think it would
3456220	3461180	behoove them though, to try to keep some kind of hype running, you know,
3461180	3464940	I think that's also why we are getting a little bit, we are getting kind of like the drip feed
3464940	3470060	of like, for example, we had that Mark Cerny, uh, game developer conference, uh, clearly crafted
3470060	3475980	presentation that came out. We just had a game that's getting up, up dude for PlayStation five,
3475980	3480220	had a trailer come out this week. And, uh, so it's showing off a little bit of what the PlayStation
3480220	3484940	five can do. Uh, that was available. So I, I do feel like they're still going to kind of like
3484940	3489580	drip feed us little bits and pieces here and there, but as for the big unveil, who knows?
3489580	3494300	And I think SGL 100 Matt has an excellent point in chat. It's kind of bad timing to announce a
3494300	3499740	price for things when people are struggling to pay rent. I don't even know if June is the time,
3499740	3504700	like Loki is saying they don't need to rush. And that's a very good point as well is that, um,
3505340	3511900	it might be kind of tacky of Sony to announce something like that until we have a solution for,
3511900	3518540	you know, when will things start to get back to some sense of normalcy and when will
3518540	3522220	the majority of people be able to go back to work and some of those things get answered?
3522220	3526540	I don't know. Um, I would hope by June, we're starting to get to some of those questions, but
3526540	3530380	I will listen to the West coast governors on that because they're listening to scientists.
3531100	3537580	So I don't think normal is going to exist. Well, that's why I said some sense of normal.
3538540	3542620	This is the new normal. I really think this is it. This is the new normal.
3542620	3545340	I don't think shelter in place is the normal forever.
3546700	3551100	I think some things are going to be different, but I, and like mass gatherings may still be
3551100	3555980	impacted for a while. I think conventions and Disneyland and those sorts of things could be,
3555980	3561260	uh, on hold for a lot longer. But I think, I mean, it just, it all depends on the testing.
3561260	3565500	It depends on the testing and tracking. That's what it boils down to. Uh, listen to those, uh,
3565500	3570860	six points that the governor laid out previously. I think they will start to open restaurants and,
3570860	3574940	you know, allow you to go visit friends and things like that, but it's going to be situations where
3574940	3580780	the contacts are traceable when it comes down to, but anyway, um, yeah, I agree with Bobby.
3580780	3585420	There's no way we're going to shelter in place until fall of 2021. I just, that's not what I
3585420	3592860	meant. Okay. I mean that it's the taking extra precautions, having more social, um, windfalls,
3592940	3596540	especially here in California. I think that they're really going to, I honestly think that
3596540	3602540	we're going to get a, uh, quite a bit more of a, uh, a socialist turn in some of this because we
3602540	3607740	are enacting more and more policies now to protect people who have no means of,
3607740	3612460	of their livelihood anymore. And I think we're going to start to see things like, um,
3612460	3617580	a little bit more involvement and hopefully on a national scale, I'd really like for us to see
3617580	3625580	more of a, uh, what's the word I'm thinking of more, um, foresight more, um, uh, gosh,
3625580	3629980	I can't think of the word right now when you're, um, when you're ahead of the curve, you know,
3631740	3636860	for when you're prepared. Yeah. Yeah. Not the word I was thinking of, but it's kind of like that
3636860	3642620	anyway, but that's, um, I'm having word problems. Um, but I think that we're hopefully that we're
3642620	3646700	going to see, we're going to actually learn from this. I mean, not with, of course,
3646700	3652380	the current administration, but I also think that we might, there's going to be a big turn against
3652380	3658540	that kind of backwards thought. We're going to start seeing people look more appreciatively at
3658540	3663020	those who provide the services of, of, of our country. I really do hope so. That's what I'm
3663020	3669100	thinking is going to be the new normal. Oops, I hit my button by accident. Um, the new normal
3669100	3675500	is going to be that we, we also hopefully we'll do a lot more for each other and live more frugally
3676060	3680300	that we're not going to be as we need, need, need, need, need all of this stuff.
3680860	3685260	When we know that it's not a need, it's a want, and we have bigger things that we need to be
3685260	3690540	worrying about just saying, and this is me as a gamer saying this. Yeah. So that made sense.
3690540	3695020	Yeah, no, I get it. I get it. Anyway, I'm trying again, it's, it's hard for the subject not to come
3695020	3699500	up, but I mean, it is impacting the video games that we're talking about. And, you know, I think
3699500	3704300	a lot of these expectations as gamers of, Oh, things are announced in June and dah, dah, dah,
3704300	3707820	like this is all up in the air due to this situation, which you just kind of like have
3707820	3714300	to understand, um, you know, that, that if anything is the new normal, it's uncertainty
3714300	3718540	and uncertainty is that normal, you know, so not everything is necessarily going to go
3718540	3725500	according to a whatever, whatever type of plan. Um, also I think worth pointing out,
3725500	3731740	remember the Nintendo switch, Nintendo switch, what they announced that in early January.
3732460	3735740	And it locked cause it was right after new year's day. It was around like January
3735740	3740220	seventh or so they announced that. And then it launched in what, like early March.
3740220	3746300	So not even like two months between announcement and launch and the Nintendo switch has done very,
3746300	3753340	very well. So there's nothing to say that Sony couldn't announce in September and then launch
3753340	3757500	it in November, two months be plenty of time for them. I don't know if that's what the investors
3757500	3765420	would like, but they could do it could happen. We'll see anyhow. All right, let's move on,
3765420	3772940	get into some other topics. Uh, let's talk about Facebook, uh, which I know, I know in some ways
3772940	3777340	I'm like, I'd rather not, because if you want to talk about where a lot of this misinformation
3777340	3782700	and people going crazy and, and 5g caused this and all this stuff, I mean, look at Facebook,
3782780	3788060	like where does, where does all that BS said about that, Rob, about, about certain technologies
3788060	3794460	causing problems like this. Um, electricity. Yeah. Anyway, it's silly. We all, I think anybody
3794460	3799180	listening to this show on a cell phone connection probably knows that that's talk is silly, but
3799180	3803500	people, people spread it. People spread things and Facebook is one thing they used to do it,
3803500	3810460	but I guess we get Facebook to spread the rumors that like loop boxes cause COVID-19.
3810460	3814700	I don't know. At least that's a positive, you know, like we can get rid of loot boxes at the
3814700	3819500	same time. We need those clickbait articles. I don't know, but, uh, maybe Facebook doesn't
3819500	3824300	want to be known as the capital of misinformation anymore. And they want to be known as a gaming
3824300	3830060	site. So Facebook is going to be releasing their own gaming mobile app this week. Supposedly it
3830060	3835740	launches on April 20th. Uh, so meaning Monday tomorrow. So we'll see. Uh, I don't know if it
3835740	3839980	will, but that's the date they're targeting. I can't wait for all of the apps to shove that
3839980	3844620	down my throat. Yeah. Right. Uh, there will be, uh, some casual games built into the app
3844620	3849980	that you can play, but you can also watch and create gaming live streams because Facebook
3849980	3855020	is trying to go after that audience with the Twitch and the YouTube and all that. They are
3855020	3860300	saying that the apple initially be available for Android. They are simply waiting on the iOS, uh,
3860300	3866860	apple approval type of a situation for, uh, that side of things. Maybe, maybe they won't. I don't
3866860	3872220	know. I think it will go through, but anyway, uh, doesn't talk about how broadcasting is going to
3872220	3878540	work on the apple devices. Um, that could be interesting, but I think stream labs works,
3878540	3886140	so I'm sure it's possible, but we'll see. Um, honestly, I'm not ready to really sign on to
3886140	3891340	Facebook gaming. I think before Facebook tries to, this is a personal opinion. I think before
3891340	3896140	Facebook tries to put its hand in all these other cookie jars, they need to fix the jar they're in
3896140	3900780	and the spreading of misinformation is that jar that needs to be fixed. Sure. I think I heard
3900780	3906140	they made it so that if you like an article that has misinformation about COVID-19, a pop-up comes
3906140	3914220	up. Um, that's a start, a really small delayed late after the fact start, but here, you know,
3914220	3921980	have a, have a cookie, you know, you did that now do more. Um, so we'll see, but in the meantime,
3921980	3926380	I'm not interested in their gaming app whatsoever. Um, but maybe some of you are and you know what,
3926380	3930220	who knows, maybe it really will be the next big thing and I'm completely underestimating it,
3930220	3936380	but I am a-okay with Twitch in the meantime. And Mixer's pretty cool too. Uh, and, uh, yeah,
3936380	3940620	I'll leave it at that. So if we don't have any other comments on that, let's go over to, um,
3940620	3945100	Dark Soccer with a bit of, um, kind of sad news. Bummers. Yeah. Lots of bummers. Sorry. Lots of
3945100	3952380	bummers, but. So we have, uh, lost some people in the gaming industry and I, I'm always like,
3952380	3957420	I read these articles. So-and-so has died. I'm like, that's very passive. They just died.
3957420	3962380	So-and-so died. Just say it, you know, I hate the, the passive, make it gentle thing. I want it
3962380	3969580	final, you know? But anyway, um, uh, among those lost was Rick May, who was the, uh, one of the
3969580	3977820	voice actors in Star Fox 64. He was Peppy, Peppy Hare and Andross, you know, bad guy. Um, he also
3977820	3984140	was, uh, the soldier in Team Fortress 2 and the narrator and voice of Genghis Khan in, uh, Age
3984140	3993340	of Empires 2. He's done movie work. He was a teacher. Um, so, uh, you know, the community has
3993340	3999340	suffered a, a loss, uh, with the hold that he's left. Um, another, you know, big name, um, a lot
3999340	4006060	that we know, um, it was Paul Haddad who was the, uh, voice of Leon in the original release of
4006060	4012940	Resident Evil 2 or Biohazard. Um, you know, and again, he had done, uh, some other movie work.
4012940	4018860	Um, he's done some animated work in the 1990s. X-Men, he was Quicksilver. So, um, he was also
4018860	4024060	like the Adventures of Tintin and Babar, you know, a lot, you know, classic video game,
4024060	4028780	video game and, uh, animation voice actor. And again, another, another hole is left.
4028780	4036220	And then our last one was the, uh, voice actor for, um, uh, Axel in, uh, Kingdom Hearts. It was,
4036220	4043340	uh, Fujiwara Keiji, um, also, also died. Um, 55 years old, too. Um, he died of cancer.
4043980	4050460	Um, and he had taken a break from voice acting in, um, from August, 2016 to June,
4050460	4056700	2017 to go through treatment. Um, but, uh, you know, one of his other big roles, um,
4056700	4063580	he was the father, um, in Crayon Shin-chan, uh, Hiroshi. And he, um, was also Arden in
4063580	4070540	Final Fantasy 15 and Reno in Final Fantasy 7 Remake. So very recent loss, very recent voice
4070540	4075660	actor. So there you go. And it is, it is interesting that the first question everybody's
4075660	4081260	asking in this day and age is, was it COVID? Um, and in this case, um, I believe Rick May
4081260	4085980	passed from COVID related complications, but, and they're, they're not St. Paul Haddad, the
4085980	4092140	cause of death was not released. So, um, don't know on that one. Um, or do you? No. Um, I,
4092140	4095740	I actually, I just closed it, but I thought that they had released it. Let me just double
4095740	4103180	check it again. And then, uh, Keiji, uh, Fujiwara, uh, was cancer, as you said. Yeah. So, um,
4103180	4110940	yeah, they did, they did release, um, what the cause of death was. Um, but, um, in other,
4110940	4115100	you know, we've also, uh, for COVID things, now this has nothing to do with video games,
4115100	4123420	but everyone knows who Christopher Cross is, right? Like from the eighties, you know, um,
4123420	4131100	but he is paralyzed because of COVID. We've lost some amazing people. One of our, our, uh,
4131100	4138220	or, uh, one of our, uh, big, uh, uh, names in trans right activism, uh, died as well. Very,
4138220	4144300	uh, very recently only, I think a couple of weeks ago. So, um, that definitely is the first thing
4144300	4148540	that we look at. Cause that seems to be the biggest killer in the United States is above
4148540	4153420	every other country in the world combined. Um, Tiger Claw and Chad is mentioning the,
4153420	4159100	uh, Danny Goldman passed this week. Uh, uh, not maybe known for games, but definitely known to
4159100	4163660	people for, uh, his role in young Frankenstein and was the voice of brainy Smurf. Uh, and then
4163660	4169420	I know we lost, uh, Brian Dennehy this week, who was very much a, that guy actor. Although
4169420	4174300	again, Brian Dennehy was not COVID. It's just, you know, people die of other causes and that
4174300	4180380	is all happening. Go back and watch Cocoon. Yeah. Yeah. He was very much at that. I always
4180380	4184540	think of, um, I know this is terrible, but I always think of the South Park movie cause
4184540	4189340	they're singing the Brian Boy Tonto song. And at one point they have Brian Dennehy showing up and
4189340	4195180	somebody goes, not fucking Brian Dennehy, Brian Boy Tonto. So, but he was definitely like, everybody
4195180	4198300	still knows who Brian Dennehy is. Like he's one of those like people you look at and you just,
4198300	4204300	yeah. Tiger claw mentioned, uh, first blood, you know, Rambo. So big girl. Yeah. Yeah. So,
4204300	4209900	um, very, very sad that, um, we're having all these losses, um, whether it be COVID or otherwise,
4209900	4215820	I know, especially with those people going out to the beach or gathering in groups,
4215820	4221660	protesting the thing that's keeping us safe. And my mom just told me that they lifted the work
4221660	4227100	restrictions in Alabama. Oh, wow. She's going back to work full time. Well, full time for her.
4227820	4233580	So yeah, I'm pissed and people are stupid, but it's, I'm trying not to get political,
4233580	4238060	but America is broken. America is broken. There's going to be a very hard lesson learned and it's
4238060	4243740	going to, it's going to be really, really unfortunate. So it's going to, the, the lesson
4243740	4249580	will be learned in blood and a story. All right. Well, let's move on to, um, something a little
4249580	4255900	less serious. Hopefully low key. I don't know. We're talking about Nintendo switch updates,
4255900	4260540	so, you know, that could be a pretty serious stuff. Yeah. It's some serious stuff. No,
4260540	4264860	in this case, they're talking a little bit about, um, allowing you to actually be able to remap
4264860	4270060	your buttons on your Nintendo switch. So that's kind of cool because it's not something that
4270060	4274540	has been available. And I know that's something that was added to, like, I know the PlayStation,
4274540	4278940	not to, well, it was probably a while ago, but it's still pretty nice that they have that feature
4278940	4284060	available. So you can swap different things like A and B buttons, or, you know, change the
4284060	4290140	orientation of the analog stick, um, you know, whatever, whatever you want to do,
4290700	4296380	uh, which is pretty cool. So, um, pretty neat that they have that available, that you could
4296380	4303100	make those changes. So that was, um, that was pretty awesome. Uh, I have not planned on using
4303100	4307340	this at all though, unfortunately, cause I haven't got to touch my switch in a long time.
4308300	4314860	It just hog that thing for Minecraft. Your switch needs some touch.
4315900	4323740	Well, it's, it misses proper affection. Yeah. I mean, um, I, I probably won't use this feature,
4323740	4330300	but I understand as far as accessibility reasons go, this is a very like easy fix for, um,
4330300	4335420	consoles to make, to help more people be able to play games on said consoles. So, um, I'm all for
4335420	4340380	it for that reason. You know, anything that opens up gaming or people is a good thing. So, um, yay
4340380	4345100	to have those features in, even if it won't be something I use myself, maybe I'll use those new
4345100	4349820	animal crossing pictures. They put it, cause I think now your little icon, uh, on animal or on
4349820	4355500	the switch can be like six animal crossing characters, but yeah. Hmm. Do they have Ed?
4356380	4359580	No, I don't think they have Ed, but they might have her SETI, but don't quote me on that. I'd
4359580	4365660	have to, uh, I have to look. So, all right. Anyway. Um, all right. Well, let's move on and
4365660	4369660	talk a little bit about, uh, a game that I think is getting a lot of attention over on Twitch and
4369660	4376380	a lot of other places. And that is a game called Valorient, uh, which is a new Riot game, right?
4376380	4381340	Of course, it's the makers of league of legends, which has been hugely popular on Twitch and other,
4381340	4386460	um, you know, competition type things, e-sports websites and stuff. Um, so many people have been
4386460	4389500	looking forward to, you know, what are some of the other things that Riot is going to develop
4389980	4394140	and one of those games that Riot's been working on, there's been others, uh, is Valorient, which
4394140	4400060	is, or is it Valorant? I thought there, is there an I in it or not? I'm not sure. Is it Valorant?
4400060	4405420	Maybe. Um, maybe somebody in chat's going to yell at me that I'm pronouncing it wrong. Yeah. I,
4405420	4409500	I don't know why, but I had an I inserted in it. Okay. So Valorants, excuse me. Sorry. I got it
4409500	4414300	wrong. Um, but, uh, for that game, I don't know. You have to apparently have a key to get in. So
4414300	4418060	it's not something I'm even playing right now anyway. So how would I, how could I be expected
4418060	4424300	to know the title? Uh, but Valorant, uh, is a new first person shooter game from, uh, Riot.
4424300	4428940	And, uh, it's causing a little bit of controversy though, because there is an anti-cheat system
4428940	4433020	that's being installed with the game. Now, not the anti-cheat systems are necessarily
4433020	4439180	controversial by nature, but this one called Riot Vanguard is apparently pretty aggressive because
4439180	4443260	it actually starts up when you start your computer up. It is not something that starts
4443260	4448460	when the game starts, such as say Fortnite's anti-cheat system launches when you launch the
4448460	4452780	game. But, you know, some folks, you know, that are kind of defending what Riot is doing with
4452780	4458780	this are saying, Hey, a lot of the ways people get around the Fortnite anti-cheat is that they
4458780	4464540	start those anti-cheats before they start, uh, Fortnite. So that way it kind of bypasses the
4464540	4469900	anti-cheat system. This being a little deeper in your computer boot up sequence, um, is a little
4469900	4475100	harder to subvert in those ways. Um, but of course, you know, people that want to really
4475100	4479500	control the type of information that's going in and out of their computer, not everybody's super
4479500	4484700	into that. Uh, in fact, on Reddit, some people are saying you have a piece of software that can't be
4484700	4489260	turned off. It runs with elevated privileges nonstop on your system. Let's say the anti-cheat
4489260	4493980	gets compromised tomorrow. You won't know that your computer is exposed and it won't update
4493980	4499980	until you start the game. Now, uh, one of the, uh, leads on the anti-cheat Paul Chamberlain
4499980	4507900	responded on subreddit to some of these, uh, uh, issues, um, saying, um, that basically, uh,
4507900	4512540	Vanguard is functioning the way it's supposed to. The anti-cheat driver itself is only one
4512540	4517340	small component of Vanguard. We've also built a new backend that allows us to be more specific
4517340	4521980	with our anti-cheat checks. Instead of running the same security stigands on all the computers,
4521980	4525660	we can run checks and response to player reports or other suspicious behavior,
4525660	4529660	which allow us to reduce the frequency and intensity of scans on the majority of players
4529660	4535740	computers. And it kind of, it kind of ends in this whole, like, you just have to trust us type of
4535740	4542460	thing. Um, we invite players who are unsure to observe our actions and call us out. If they don't
4542460	4547180	like what they see, we think most players will appreciate our efforts, but if they don't, then
4547180	4555580	we'll change tactics and find another way to meet our players' expectations. Hmm. So, um, and Quest
4555580	4560700	Buster, uh, giving the secret on how to get into this game saying you have a chance to get a beta
4560700	4565900	key drop by watching a Valorant stream with a Twitch account linked to Riot. It's one reason
4565900	4571020	why Valorant streamers have titles emphasizing drops enabled. So people want you to come look
4571020	4576300	at their stream so that you have a chance to get into the game for yourself. So, um, but obviously
4576300	4580060	this anti-cheat thing being on all the time, it's something some folks may want to consider.
4580860	4585980	Something to go with that though, and I think this is important to say as well, um, Riot is offering
4585980	4593980	up to $100,000 if you can find a security flaw in Vanguard. Uh, it is a contest, I guess you could
4593980	4599100	say, being hosted at HackerOne. And, uh, that is a site where there's all sorts of tech companies
4599100	4604380	offering bounties for finding issues with their, um, uh, software and so forth. Um,
4605420	4610540	this starts at $25,000 for a bug that allows outside entities to access a user's private
4610540	4617100	information all the way to $100,000 for code execution at the kernel level. Basically meaning
4617100	4624780	that somebody kind of like, I guess like an alien in the movie kind of face hugs on to this software
4624780	4628620	to do very bad things to your computer because it's something that boots up when your computer
4628700	4634860	boots up. So, um, I suppose that's one way to, uh, make a point about this software and make
4634860	4640460	some money off of it if you want. So, let's see, um, TigerKlonchat says, I wonder if it's
4640460	4643820	something you can go into the task manager and disable in the startup. I don't know,
4643820	4647740	because I haven't used it myself, but Bobby does make a good point. If it was, people wouldn't be
4647740	4652220	complaining. So yeah, I think, I think if it was easy enough to kill it like that, people probably
4652220	4656060	wouldn't be complaining. Um, so, you know, something to think about when you're going to
4656060	4659020	install the game, this isn't going to stop everybody from installing the game, you know,
4659020	4665660	and, and riot to give them some credit. They are saying, if you think there's a problem with it,
4665660	4669820	call us out, watch it, see what it does for yourself. And if you think it's doing anything,
4669820	4674540	it shouldn't be call us on it. So it is interesting. They're kind of taking that stance
4674540	4678300	where it's like, no, really, we're not taking any personal information. We're not doing anything
4678300	4683980	like watch, you know, so it's, I'm less interested in what it's potentially going to do to my system
4683980	4688940	in one more interest in if it's actually going to still work, because it seems like whenever
4688940	4694620	these anti-cheat things are put in place, it just prompts people to try to find something that's
4694620	4699420	subverted. So I guess we'll have to wait and see. So it'd be interesting. It'll be interesting to
4699420	4704780	see if somebody wants to do it for the $100,000 bounty or wants to do it just so they can do it.
4706700	4709580	We'll see what happens. The internet's an interesting place sometimes.
4710380	4711660	Why can't we have both?
4712700	4716620	And we probably will. But in the meantime, we'll go to our next story, Darsakra.
4719020	4723100	Well, how about something happy, something positive? Well, I mean, it's not really happy.
4723980	4729260	But it's, I guess, positive. Because remember, positive things aren't always happy things.
4730540	4738380	So there is a gamer who played Final Fantasy XIV. Rob, this is relevant to your interests,
4738380	4739420	I'm sure. Yes, of course.
4740380	4748940	But in-game, he was known as Fern LeRoy, L-E apostrophe R-O-Y. And he was very, very popular,
4748940	4755900	well-liked by his free company and lots of people. And he died of the novel coronavirus.
4756700	4763180	And it went out on Reddit about it. They started talking about it. And they had a funeral
4763180	4770540	procession. So on his server, which is the Zalera server, they started off in Uldah,
4770540	4777740	in the desert. And they were joined by characters from another server, Core, where his alt was on,
4777740	4786860	named Poppy Rose. And the whole group wore black. They had black parasols. They wore very funeral
4786860	4793580	appropriate clothing. And they walked all the way through the central shroud and ended up at
4793580	4799980	the Guardian Tree. I mean, sacred site in the game. It took 30 minutes of in-game time to make
4799980	4806060	the walk. Because they were walking and not running. Many people run by default, but these
4806060	4813980	folks walked. Yeah, it was a very slow procession. As I recall, there's videos of it. There were live
4813980	4824540	tweets of it, all of that. And they finally ended with some words and, I guess, a virtual funeral.
4825260	4834220	So as it went, they all went on to Twitter, talked about what the people did. And one of the quotes
4834220	4839340	on there is, the Final Fantasy XIV community never ceases to amaze me. Such a huge turnout and show
4839420	4844540	respect to community and camaraderie at this memorial service. My view distance couldn't
4844540	4850620	handle so many people. May the fallen player rest in peace. My condolences to all involved. Be safe,
4850620	4857340	everyone. And I mean, basically, another person said that it took up two to three zones of the
4857340	4863980	base game. So pretty big. And so many people offering their condolences. It was just really,
4864540	4872060	really beautiful. And not the first time we've seen other players honor somebody in a game.
4872060	4879740	For sure. But this is a very big one to do it in a big MMO and cross server. So, hey.
4879740	4885020	Well, and I think also, yes, you're right. We've heard of this type of memorial before. It's not
4885020	4889820	the first time it's even happened in Final Fantasy XIV. And I'm sure many people have seen this sort
4889820	4899260	of similar memorial in EverQuest or World of Warcraft or insert many other major MMOs here.
4899260	4905260	But I also think the reason why this is kind of newsworthy all over again, and why this particular
4905260	4911500	story is getting the credit it is, is because for many people, you can't really memorialize in
4911500	4916380	person right now. That's what makes everything that's going on almost even more tragic is that
4916380	4922620	those that pass really can't be properly, and I'm using my quoting fingers, memorialized because
4922620	4928940	people can't gather in one place. So this is one way that people are getting around that of sorts
4928940	4933900	by doing a virtual type of memorial. And I almost wonder if this isn't the type of thing you might
4933900	4941420	see more of in these. I mean, not that I would wish that, but I think it might just be one of
4941420	4950380	those, because of that issue we have, you might see this happen more often. And even in things
4950380	4956700	like Animal Crossing, not even things like funerals, but like weddings, drag shows, I mean,
4956700	4962380	you name it, things that people gather to do in person, they're doing an Animal Crossing, and MMOs
4962380	4968860	and stuff, I'm sure. So it's an interesting sign of the times, even if this isn't the first time
4968860	4973500	we've heard a story like that. There was one instance in Animal Crossing where the person made
4973500	4978780	an 18 tile image of her mother who had just died and they couldn't hold a funeral.
4981260	4989180	That's really sad. Yeah. And so she spent time taking an actual photo, bringing it into the
4990060	4995340	pattern maker and trying to get it all just right to have a picture, a memorial to her mother. And
4996220	5002300	it was like, it took her two weeks to do it and then have a funeral in game.
5004460	5009900	And not to go on the sad point of this, but unhappy things, like I said, I was using this
5009900	5017100	for my birthday, to have a little birthday party today. So people are also using the games for
5017100	5022140	happier occasions. For sure. Not everything is a Zoom meeting, although certainly that's getting
5022140	5028060	used a lot too. So, all right. Well, let's move on. Just a couple more stories before we get to
5028060	5034380	the classic game of the week. Loki. Let's talk about more things that are closed. So unfortunately,
5034380	5039260	with E3 and everything being canceled, we were kind of hoping that maybe Gamescom might be the
5039260	5045340	answer to getting some of our gaming news. Fortunately, because of a ruling in Germany
5045340	5050940	that has basically banned any large gatherings until the end of August, Gamescom is also going
5050940	5057820	to be canceled. So what's good though is they are refunding all the tickets that were already
5057820	5063100	ordered, but unfortunately they're not going to have a live event. Now they're planning on maybe
5063100	5068780	doing a digital event. So they're working on that, but there's not really any details on that just
5068780	5077660	yet. So hopefully we'll have something digital from them coming around the same time. That,
5077660	5085180	as well as we also news that San Diego Comic-Con has also been canceled. San Diego Comic-Con,
5085740	5090940	of course, mostly a comic convention as well as like moving properties like that,
5091500	5096540	but they do have some gaming announcements and gaming stuff sometimes coming out of that as well.
5096540	5102460	So unfortunately this year they're not going to be doing that either. Yeah. I think like when
5102460	5107900	Marvel versus Capcom 3 or Infinite or whatever it was called was coming out, like they announced
5107900	5113820	a lot of stuff at Comic-Con. So sometimes you get some kind of gaming tangents, we'll say.
5114780	5117980	Yeah. So that's unfortunate that they're not going to be doing that, but they did announce
5117980	5124300	that they'll be returning next year, July 22nd through the 25th. So that's unfortunate,
5124300	5127900	lots of stuff that we're looking forward to. Hopefully we'll get those announcements anyways.
5127900	5131340	And besides, you know, I can't go to Comic-Con, so I got to wait for all those trailers to hit
5131340	5136860	online anyways. So whatever. Yeah. I mean, it honestly, at this point just seems like if it's
5136860	5142940	a convention in 2020, it's probably not going to happen. So, you know, and that obviously makes me
5142940	5148700	sad and I still I'm crossing my fingers and my toes that maybe a miracle happens. Maybe anything
5148700	5153900	is possible after all, especially the whole world working on it, but I'm slowly accepting that
5153900	5158700	reality as sad as it is. So it'll just make that next year. And once we get on the other side of
5158700	5166380	this, it'll make it all that much sweeter, I suppose. So, all right. Well, maybe some good
5166380	5173020	news about what's going on with the ESRB is that finally, after all this time, and it feels like
5173020	5178860	really one of those things where it's like, finally, they did this. The ESRB is now adding
5178860	5184460	to their ratings if a game has loot boxes, except they're not calling it that, they're calling it
5184460	5190060	in-game purchases. So if the game has microtransactions, it will have a little
5190060	5193340	addition to the label underneath. It doesn't affect the letter rating and that can still be,
5193340	5197740	you know, E for everyone or, you know, excuse me, the typical ratings that the video games use.
5198300	5203260	But, you know, it always says why, like, why did this game get an M? It's not just in-game
5203260	5206540	purchases because that's been a thing that's already been happening, but now they're including
5206540	5210380	if it includes random items. I'm sorry. Yes, thank you. I would have gotten there eventually. Yes,
5210380	5215500	it includes random items is the other key word there with the in-game purchases. And that means,
5215500	5219900	because they're not saying loot boxes, because I guess that's not really a term they expect
5219900	5223900	everybody to know. They did explain it on their website why they didn't use loot boxes, but,
5224780	5228940	you know, whatever. They're still kind of making it clear that that is the reason why they're
5228940	5233420	putting it on the rating. And so it will be assigned to all games that include purchases
5233420	5239820	with any randomized elements, including loot boxes, gotcha games, item or card packs. So
5239820	5245820	that would affect things like Magic the Gathering online and stuff too. Prize wheel or what's
5245820	5253100	blizzards? Hearthstone, things like that. Prize wheels, treasure chests, and more. Games that have
5253100	5258540	the in-game purchases includes random items. Notice may also include other non-randomized
5258540	5263100	paid elements. And I'm thinking that might be something like Overwatch that, you know,
5263740	5268700	it kind of has a little bit of both. So not, well, not very often, but I have seen them sell skins
5268700	5275260	for charity. So that would count. So anyway, there it is. That is what they're doing.
5276380	5282700	What do you guys think? It's about time, right? It's one of those things where it's like, oh,
5282700	5287100	now that it's happened, there's so much other crap going on in the world. It's like, oh,
5287100	5294860	you finally caught up. Great. Have a cookie. It's not hardly even catching up. It's just like,
5294860	5298940	they're just kind of checking off that box. Like, see, we're doing something. We care.
5298940	5303260	But really they don't. I mean, I just, I don't think anybody,
5305580	5309660	they're never going to do anything because unfortunately the ESA, well, this isn't
5309660	5318060	necessarily ESA, but I don't know. A lot of lobbying done by the ESA because for these
5318060	5322300	publishers, this is a very big revenue source for them. So of course they're not going to want to
5322300	5326620	get rid of this stuff. And so they're just basically saying, you know, kind of checking
5326620	5331980	the boxes so that when this controversy comes up, oh, it's gambling. But we tell you that it's in
5331980	5336060	the game. We have the ratings. It shows it on here. See, we're not trying to trick you,
5336620	5342060	you know, that type of stuff. So it'll be interesting to see that also includes like,
5342060	5348780	you know, some of these games that add it after the fact, because I know that a lot of times the
5348780	5356060	boxes will be printed with these certain ratings. And then like, for example, the crash team racing
5356060	5361100	stuff had loot boxes added after the game came out and after it's been reviewed. And I'm thinking
5361100	5364700	that a lot of times when these ratings are updated, they don't necessarily update them
5364700	5370300	to the printed box copies, but they will update the ratings on the ESRB website. Like anybody
5371180	5380060	even goes there to look at anything. So I don't know. I just, good job. At least you tried.
5381260	5388540	All right. ESRB, this claps for you. Here we go. One clap instead of a round of applause. You get one
5388540	5393180	clap. All right. Let's move on. Let's move on to simpler times when there was no, there were no
5393180	5398380	random items purchasable for money. You got what you got with your cartridge and you were happy
5398460	5401900	with it. It's a classic game of the week. Dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault
5401900	5408620	and find a game that she thinks, Hey, Hey, you play this, not that, uh, dark Sakura,
5408620	5415180	what is your pick for the classic game of the week? I picked F zero, which is another thing
5415180	5420140	I'm surprised I've never picked before. Me too. This is, this is one of my big classics. I love
5420140	5426700	this game. Yeah. I love me some F zero and I might've sat and jammed out to the mute city,
5426780	5430460	you know, uh, level, cause honestly it's my favorite music in the game.
5431900	5438860	Um, so yeah, um, F zero is, uh, one of those, uh, early racing game. Well, not really early
5438860	5445180	for the super Nintendo, but it was, uh, I'd say one of those notable games. It was the first,
5445180	5450620	of course of the F zero series. It was a launch title for the SNES. So yes, it was early for,
5451020	5457420	for the super Nintendo. Um, it has been emulated on a virtual console services. Um,
5457420	5462940	and I'll, I'll get into, of course, other releases of it, but the game is taking place in 2560
5463580	5472060	where, um, you, uh, race formula one races, uh, called F zero. Um, and basically it's just bored
5472060	5477580	rich people who made up these kinds of races. And so you have, uh, you know, all of your,
5478140	5482540	you know, various characters who race and you've got, you know, power ups here and there are very
5482540	5491340	futuristic, really good music, some floating areas. Um, um, but the races and F zero, uh,
5491340	5497180	are five laps around a track. You have to complete each lap in a successfully higher place so that
5497180	5503100	you're not disqualified as you're going through. So, um, you are also given a four second speed
5503100	5509260	boost when you pass, um, a lap called the super jet and you get points determined by what place
5509260	5517340	you're on. Um, and you can even, uh, get an extra machine so that you can, uh, retry the course.
5517340	5522060	Um, if you, if you've got a certain points and you haven't made it through. So, um, you've got
5522060	5526780	two different methods of boosting your speed. You have these plates that will launch you into the
5526780	5536860	air with, um, extra acceleration. Um, and then, um, you, uh, also have, uh, uh, just the, the
5536860	5542300	general, uh, dash zones that, uh, increase your speed on the ground. Um, you have two modes of
5542300	5546700	play of grand prix mode where you choose a league and you race against other vehicles in there,
5546700	5552220	and then practice mode where you just basically play, play along, play along. Um, your, your
5552380	5557900	15 tracks divided into three leagues. So you have a knight queen and king. Those are the difficulty
5557900	5563100	levels. Um, and each league has up to four selectable levels in there. You have beginner
5563100	5569180	standard expert master. Um, you've got multiple courses for death, wind, port town and red canyon.
5569180	5575980	Um, they have a pathway that's not accessible, um, until you're on another iteration of that,
5575980	5580140	of that track. And then it closes the previous pack. So it kind of moves things around here.
5580940	5587420	Um, as far as, um, the development in this game, it, um, in Japan, it was a launch title,
5587420	5593020	November 1st, 1990. Um, it came out in the U S August, 1991 in Europe, uh, sometime in 1992.
5593660	5596940	And in the Japanese market, it was only that in super Mario world that came out.
5597580	5603260	Um, in North America, of course, we had zero pilot wings, uh, SimCity, Gradius three, and,
5603260	5611180	uh, and super Mario world. But, um, the game was produced by Miyamoto. Um, uh, artwork was done by,
5611180	5620220	uh, Shimizu Kazunobu. Um, one of the, uh, art designers, um, was, uh, basically, uh, and his
5620220	5625660	name, sorry, Imamura Takaya, um, got some pretty free reign for doing some of the design for the
5625660	5631500	characters and the courses. Um, so they really kind of went all out. And one of the good things
5631500	5635900	about this game is that this is really, I think one of the games that gave us a clear introduction
5635900	5644700	to mode seven. Um, yeah, that's like the cute. Yeah, go ahead. So mode seven for, for, for y'all
5644700	5652460	kids, you don't know what the mode seven is. Um, it is a way of raster scaling. So basically,
5652460	5657340	I'm sure you've heard the word vector. I'm sure you've heard raster, um, vector uses mathematical
5657340	5662940	calculations. So that's why, say in a vector designed game or vector art, no matter how much
5662940	5667420	you resize it, it stays the same because it's all mathematically recalculating itself. Raster
5667420	5672940	is going to be basically pixel. So yeah, you did get like zoomed in pixels on everything. I mean,
5672940	5681500	think of, uh, uh, what am I trying to think of that had a really bad zoom in? Um, but at any rate,
5681500	5688940	you, you had, you know, but it would move and scale and it gave you this, uh, pseudo 3d. Um,
5690380	5696060	and, uh, it really was mind blowing at the time. I mean, we had racing games before,
5696060	5700300	but this was the big one. Yeah. Like, you know, and again, I know, uh, we have, you know, a lot
5700300	5705420	of folks in their twenties and low thirties who may not have really been around or were very,
5705420	5709660	very, very young when this game first came out. But like, you know, many of us that are hosting
5709660	5714380	the show were like, you know, like 12 and 13 and so forth when this game first came out.
5714380	5720540	And I got to tell you, it was mind blowing. Like it, like the 3d in this game, the fact it was
5720540	5726700	like all in a cartridge and just like how it moved so fast. And I don't know if that was part
5726700	5730860	of the intentional design of why they did the game the way that they did, but in a stage like
5730860	5736780	mute city, it's going by so fast. It looks like it's a real city down there, even though if you,
5736780	5741260	even though if you take a look, cause it really it's, it's just like a painted sprite. It's like
5741260	5745900	something you could have done a Mario paint, really a 2d Mario paint that they do this mode
5745900	5750940	seven effect on and then layer the, um, sprite of the car on top of it. It's, it's really brilliant.
5750940	5754380	But when it goes that fast, it looks like a city. But when you look at it kind of standing still,
5754380	5761260	you can see it's kind of garbage, but it doesn't matter. That's something that, that designers do.
5761260	5764700	I mean, like for example, if you have a billboard, you know, your print in a book,
5765580	5770700	resolution should be 300 DPI, 300 dots per inch. When you're doing, say something on a billboard,
5770700	5774540	it's going to be half that, you know, it's going to be higher than web quality, for example. But
5774540	5778940	when you're looking at it from that distance, moving that fast, it doesn't need to be 300 DPI.
5780060	5784460	And that's what they're going with. It's, it's an illusion. It's a, uh, chunk dull, you know,
5784460	5788300	the, the trick, the eye. Yeah. And it's, and I don't know if you were going to bring it up,
5788300	5793740	so I'm sorry if I'm talking ahead of you, but, um, you know, Mario Kart obviously was a huge,
5793740	5798460	you know, in some ways successor to this, but Mario Kart essentially uses all the same tricks
5798460	5805740	of F-Zero. It's all the same tricks. The only, in many ways, Super Mario Kart is F-Zero too.
5805740	5811180	And I know that sounds a little weird, but without F-Zero, you would not have Mario Kart.
5811180	5816860	It's really, it's really that simple. No, I, I get that. I absolutely get that.
5817660	5820380	Um, and you know, there is really
5822540	5830540	so much, you know, that people, I think, take for granted about, um, about this game and what it
5830540	5835500	really is offered, you know, and we've had many other ones, which I'll be touching on, uh, later
5835500	5840460	and, you know, they've been certainly popular and well talked about on this show. So, um, you know,
5840460	5847980	looking at this, it really is, I think what modernized the racing game for the home console.
5848780	5855900	Make sense? Yes. And a few other things with that mode seven is that it also allowed for
5855900	5860300	different texture mapping, you know, and I'm not going to get in way too much into a little bit
5860300	5863740	more of that. We talked about what it does in practice as opposed to what it does on the back
5863740	5869020	end. So I'm going to get into a little bit more of the periphery about it and how it was received
5869020	5875420	when we had come on since then. So did you know there was an F-Zero jazz album? I did. Somebody
5875420	5881820	got me a copy of that way back in the day. I did. The songs translate well to jazz. In fact, um,
5881820	5887580	in Mario Kart 8, because they bring back, I think those like, they're kind of jazzy covers. They're
5887580	5892700	not the same jazzy covers, but they're, they're also jazz inspired, uh, versions of the tracks in
5892700	5899260	Mario Kart when they do the F-Zero levels. Well, and the other one of the other things too, is that,
5899260	5906940	um, the, uh, great. I lost my train of thought. Um, the album actually did bring in some, some
5906940	5912300	notable musicians. I mean, basically maybe, maybe if you weren't super big into jazz might not know
5912300	5917980	them, but we had, uh, uh, uh, for playing on saxophone, Mark Russo of the yellow jackets,
5917980	5924460	Robin Ford on electric guitar, um, you had for your, uh, 12 tracks on, uh, from the game were
5924460	5931180	composed by, uh, Kanki Umiko and Ishida Naoto with arrangements by Robert Hill and Michiko Hill.
5931180	5935820	Um, so it actually, I think it's a really good album. It's a kind of a, kind of a chill fun thing
5935820	5942540	to listen to, you know. Um, but the game itself was very well received. Um, and basically they,
5942540	5949420	they thought it was some of the most fluid pseudo 3d of its time. Um, it got, I mean, just, you know,
5949420	5957180	I'll put it this way, Famitsu gave it a 37 out of 40. That's pretty good for Famitsu. Yeah. Yeah.
5957180	5963020	IGN gave it a 7.5 out of 10, which I don't know why, because it was better than that. Um, it had
5963020	5970620	variety of tracks. Um, it had really, uh, I'm trying to think of a good way. Well, actually,
5970860	5976620	GameSpy, uh, one of the writers said that it was a finesse racer. Um, it took practice and
5976620	5984060	memorization and a fine, uh, sense of control. So I think that it really did bring more excitement to
5984060	5990700	a genre that maybe had started to fall a little bit. Um, and as far as, uh, its, uh, legacy,
5990700	5995900	it did invent that futuristic racing genre. Would we have had Wipeout without that? Um, would we
5995900	6002940	have had, um, any of these other kind of high-tech future racing games? Um, Daytona, um, USA even was
6002940	6011900	inspired by F-Zero. Um, and, uh, in fact, even, uh, the president of, uh, amusement's vision,
6011900	6019980	uh, Nagoshi Toshihiro stated that, um, F-Zero taught him what a game should be and influenced
6019980	6026220	him to create Daytona USA. So, and then it's also amusement vision that did work with Nintendo,
6026220	6033260	um, to create F-Zero GX and AX. And Nagoshi was one of the, uh, co-producers of the game. So,
6033260	6039260	like I said, there were sequels. Um, of course, they had developed a sequel of F-Zero on this
6039260	6046460	nest. Um, but, uh, it was supposed to be for the Satellaview, um, subscription, uh, using that add
6046460	6053660	on. Um, and in fact, you could get F-Zero from one of the download kiosks, um, in Japan. It was,
6053660	6063420	oh crap, what was it called? Um, the, uh, I know what it was called. It was, um, I'm forgetting
6063420	6068780	what it was called. It was like a download kiosk that gave you, um, one of, you know, it kind of
6068780	6072460	was like how the, um, the Famicom disc works. Yeah, I was gonna say, I've read about those,
6072460	6076220	especially for the Famicom disc system. Nintendo Power. It was called the Nintendo Power. Oh,
6076220	6079820	how funny. Maybe that's where the magazine got its name, but yeah, we didn't have anything like
6079820	6084060	that in the US, obviously. That was very much a Japanese only type of thing, but that's, you know,
6084060	6088380	a big reason why Famicom had a disc system. Yeah. Yeah. And the Satellaview too, obviously,
6088380	6095180	would never hear either. Um, but at any rate, um, you, uh, if you had the, uh, Saint Giga
6095180	6100380	subscription for Satellaview, um, on the Super Famicom, you could, you could get that kind of
6100380	6105020	add on version and then you could download those titles and save it on the flash ROM cartridge.
6105020	6108860	Um, the sequel was released as the name of BS F-Zero Grand Prix, cause you know,
6108860	6114220	they're all the BS Satellaview and BS F-Zero Grand Prix too. Um, you can get lots of them
6114220	6121980	to say it now in the words, but, um, the F-Zero, uh, Grand Prix had a new track along with the
6121980	6127740	original 15 and four different playable vehicles. And according to Nintendo Power, um, they wanted
6127820	6134700	to bring it to North America via a game pack. Um, but it didn't. Um, so as far as other ones we had
6134700	6142220	on the Nintendo 64 F-Zero X, where, um, they continued to, um, you know, to, to try to push
6142220	6147340	what that system could do. Um, and there was a lot of pushing to be done. Let me tell you, um,
6148380	6152220	they also brought the mode seven graphic effects into the Game Boy advanced version for
6152860	6161020	maximum velocity and GP legend, um, which, uh, the former was released in 2001. Um,
6161020	6167580	and it was considered to be a hard over overhaul of F-Zero. Um, there was also F-Zero GX and AX,
6167580	6173740	which were, um, uh, uh, respectively released for the Nintendo GameCube and Triforce arcade
6173740	6180940	system boards in 2003. And it was the first, uh, big video game collaboration between Nintendo and
6180940	6186620	Sega. And I really, we, we, we here at orange on radio cannot understate how good those games were
6186620	6193420	and how fabulous that whole like arcade connection was. It was just, it was amazing. Unmatched since
6193420	6202060	then. And GX was the first of zero game that had a story mode. Um, AX was also, um, uh, called,
6202060	6207180	uh, little GameStop said that, you know, GameStop GameSpot said they're the first to get a proper
6207180	6213340	arcade release. So, um, and then of course the most recent one is F-Zero climax that came out
6213340	6219340	for a Game Boy advanced in 2004 and the first, uh, F-Zero game to have a built-in, uh, track
6219340	6224860	editor without needing an expansion or add-on. I was going to say, uh, GX actually has, well,
6224860	6231420	it's hidden in the code, but actually has the AX like interface in tracks and everything in there.
6231420	6236380	I know you can unlock some tracks when you link it with the arcade, but they actually had the
6236940	6243660	AX mode in there that they never enabled. Yeah. I remember that. But at any rate, I mean,
6243660	6251500	there we go. It's such a prime game and I'm sorry, I had never even done this on, uh, uh,
6251500	6256460	for the classic game of the week because I really, really believe that we are due for a new F-Zero.
6256460	6263500	We are over due for a new F-Zero. It's been 16 years, Nintendo. I'm just, I am sad that Mario
6263500	6267980	Kart has just taken over Nintendo, which I, and don't get me wrong, I love Mario Kart. So it's
6267980	6273180	not like I'm like really mad about it. I think, I think Mario Kart has just taken over Nintendo's
6273180	6276700	racing thing because I think at the end of the day, Mario Kart sold better. You put Mario in it
6276700	6281260	and it sells better. And you know, that's, that's on us for not supporting F-Zero. Well, I mean,
6281260	6286700	you, me and Matt have always supported F-Zero, but, uh, you know, it's on the general gaming
6286700	6291580	populace for not supporting it the same way that they support Mario. I wish they would do more DLC
6291580	6298940	maybe 16 years. There's a good portion of the populace that wasn't alive. I know, I know,
6298940	6303580	I know. No, you're right. You're right. But, um, yeah, it is funny because some folks in
6303580	6307580	chatter, like I swear you've done F-Zero this game of the week before, but like, I know,
6307580	6311340	I think that's just because I looked on the Wiki. No, I don't think I know, but it's, it's one of
6311340	6316140	those. I think it's because we talk so much about, and maybe we've done F-Zero AX and GX. We probably
6316140	6320620	did those games in some way, but, um, maybe it's because we talk so much about how much we love
6320620	6325500	F-Zero and that these games need to come back that it seems like we've done it as a classic
6325500	6331740	game of the week. So anyway, um, orange right says, isn't F-Zero on the super Nintendo switch
6331740	6336620	online? Yes, it is. And it's on the classic, uh, super Nintendo mini. So, uh, many ways to still
6336620	6342300	officially revisit this game legally without having to download a ROM. So, um, yeah, get on it,
6342300	6346860	kids check out, uh, F-Zero and, uh, think about how you wouldn't have Mario Kart without it.
6347660	6351500	So we talked a lot, we let the video loop twice on that. We talked about that. What are you doing
6351500	6356860	with your life? Seriously? Get with game. Uh, honestly though, like, even if you can't like
6356860	6361100	super get into the original, because the original does feel a little plain now, uh, you know,
6361100	6365900	cause like there's only like one type of car you're ever passing us over, like try somehow
6365900	6370460	to play F-Zero GX. And I really wish Nintendo would bring that back somehow, even if they just
6370460	6375180	bring back F-Zero GX, like I would so support that coming out on, on switch.
6375980	6380780	I also want to point out to Bobby who says, you know what they need to do. They need to
6380780	6383900	make a spinoff game. That's based on the smash brothers character, captain Falcon
6384940	6394460	whale. There was an anime called F-Zero GP legend that, um, talked, uh, had quite a bit of, um,
6394460	6398300	of captain Falcon in it. He is actually one of the main protagonists in it. Um,
6398940	6407420	uh, he is, uh, named Bart otherwise, but yeah, it's, uh, basically, uh, had this whole plot
6407420	6411580	around, uh, captain Falcon. And yeah, he was the main protagonist in the GX story mode.
6412140	6417100	All right. Well, let's, uh, yeah. And the other interesting thing about GX is that they had
6417100	6422220	a record. I was saying something about it because not everyone knows that they have like,
6423020	6427340	like something like 32 characters in F-Zero GX. So there's a ton of characters,
6427340	6432540	every single one of them has a theme song. And like, unless you go into the character
6432540	6437020	information screen, you'll never hear it. It's so interesting to me how like, there's so many
6437020	6443100	characters and so many theme songs and you probably missed them in F-Zero. It's just
6443100	6451500	interesting. So audio blink. Yeah, for sure. And I was going to say, and if for those fans of DDR,
6452060	6457260	a couple of the characters had clips, uh, from, um, it's not, well, it's not clips,
6457260	6466140	but it, it, it samples the same samples as legend of max. Really? Yes. I, I, I back in the day when
6466140	6473740	I did these, like some, I did a lot of the Loki remix things. Those are good. Some of the lamer
6473740	6480460	low key remixes were like, uh, with one of those songs and yeah, it has, has the fly and stuff
6480460	6483900	like that in there. I wonder if I need to play those on Twitch some night. I wonder if I could
6483900	6487580	get away with playing those on Twitch. It would depend which ones, probably the, the ones rooted
6487580	6491740	in Bamani are probably fine, but maybe some of your, like the ones from the matrix soundtrack,
6491740	6495500	I probably couldn't do those, but, uh, yeah, we'll have to play some of those some night.
6495500	6499420	All right. Anyway. Uh, thank you. It was a good classic of the week. Really good. Um,
6499420	6503820	well, I mean, they're all good, but that one was particularly good. Extra good. Extra good. All
6503820	6508860	right. Uh, anyway, let's move on. Uh, rapid fire news. Uh, we got still a lot of news to cover.
6508860	6515580	Let's get to it. Loki. All right. So let's talk a little bit about, uh, Terraria. So that's a game
6515580	6520940	that we haven't brought up in a long time, but Hey, they're doing their final update on May 16th
6520940	6529420	on PC. So the game's been out since 2011 and their final update called a title or is it journeys end
6529980	6534780	is going to be coming out on all of the, I at least on PC at first. And then I assume
6534780	6539340	the other platforms as well. Uh, it's going to add a bunch of new items, characters, and
6539340	6543980	mini biomes. So look forward to that. I think that's something that's in my library that
6543980	6551820	haven't played ever. So maybe I'll have to check it out and then, well, just when you thought your
6551820	6556620	PC can run everything, they have to go and remaster crisis. So that's going to be coming
6556620	6562780	out as well on PC PlayStation four, Xbox one and the switch. So if you got that brand new switch
6562780	6568300	and you really want to turn it into a melted piece of rubble, then run some crisis remastered
6568300	6574540	on that. And that should be coming out. Uh, let's see, I don't know if they have a date on that yet,
6574540	6580300	but later this year. And, um, so what are we going to get with the remastered? Uh,
6580300	6587660	it's going to actually have HD texture packs. I, uh, enhance campaign, improved art assets,
6587660	6593900	temporal anti-aliasing, um, a lot of other fun stuff. And I assume that you have obviously
6593900	6600460	switched probably running a little less of that, but, um, maybe even some retracing and stuff. So
6601900	6607580	pretty awesome. Uh, we'll have to, uh, check it out. And fun fact, uh, the game was set in 2020.
6607580	6615660	So yeah. How topical. All right. Well, moving on a little bit of a follow-up something we talked
6615660	6620620	about last week and the fact that the, uh, Japanese Nintendo switch shipments were on hold
6620620	6624860	because some of the, um, COVID related, uh, lockdowns and et cetera that are going on
6624860	6630540	overseas, uh, a follow-up this week indicates that Nintendo will, uh, begin to resume shipping
6630540	6634940	of Nintendo switch units later this week, which probably by the time now that I'm reading this
6634940	6639740	already occurred, uh, they did halt the distribution of the console because of COVID-19
6639740	6644940	related issues. Um, but because of global demand, they are continuing shipments. Um,
6644940	6650940	so there you go, uh, that, that is continuing. So hopefully those get to be a little bit easier to
6650940	6655420	find, but I also hope they are being done safely. I don't have a lot of details as to
6656060	6661180	how they made that happen again, but hopefully it is safe. I don't know. Uh, also, uh, a quick
6661180	6666460	update, awesome games done quick, uh, is going on. Well, it's not the awesome games done quick. It
6666460	6672220	is actually, uh, Corona games done quick, I believe is the name of it. Um, Corona relief.
6672220	6677820	Thank you. Corona relief done quick is going on right now. Uh, and they're actually wrapping up.
6677820	6682860	I think they're on the last run they're on the, or did they finish? I think they might be completely
6682860	6687340	done now. It might be. Yeah. I think I was anticipating we'd be at this story by seven 30,
6687340	6690540	but they, uh, they're done now. It's eight o'clock. So they finished their last speed run.
6690540	6694300	They are done. I didn't get the final fundraising number. I was going to go to the website to get
6694300	6697820	the final fundraising number. Does anybody know how much they raised? It was that like
6698460	6702060	200,000 or something when I checked earlier today, maybe somebody in our chat knows,
6702860	6708940	but they, for being, um, all virtual and not being in a hotel and only being a weekend,
6708940	6713980	not a week. Uh, they did a pretty darn good job. Uh, so I was going to get people an update on
6713980	6718380	that, but unfortunately, since we got to it a little late, uh, they're done, it's over.
6718380	6726140	So I don't know what the, thank you orange. Right. For just over $400,000, $400,529 and 60 cents.
6726140	6730060	Thank you. Orange. Right. Uh, that's how much they ended up raising. So that's really good.
6730060	6734060	Uh, again, considering that most of them go for a week and this one was just a weekend.
6734060	6739020	Um, that's really good. Cool. Cool. All right. And they had an exhibition with a pump it up too.
6739020	6742860	So that was pretty awesome. Oh, did they, I missed that. I saw a little earlier today when
6743740	6747340	something like that I think was the username, but, um, they did like,
6747340	6752860	uh, a live stream of some guy playing pump it up in his room or I assume in his house.
6752860	6755260	That's awesome. All right. Uh, dark Sakura.
6757660	6761740	Well, in, uh, other news, you know how we every so often bring in some like,
6762380	6766940	like, I'm not going to say legit, but just like the financial, you know, stuff, right.
6767820	6774540	You know, Bloomberg has touched on, um, on animal crossing and actually has named the game,
6774540	6781820	the biggest hit of the lockdown. Um, and one of their, uh, research analysts that they work with,
6781820	6787100	um, was saying, uh, that they have, and I'm going to read the quote. I have never seen so many
6787100	6793580	people sharing so many screenshots of a single game on social networking sites. Um, and, uh,
6793580	6799420	they're actually saying that Nintendo was likely to surpass its fiscal year sales numbers, um,
6799420	6804780	which are going to be out on May 7th. Um, that basically, you know, we were talking last week
6804780	6808860	about this being like the prime time to release this game. Right. I mean, not that it was done
6808860	6812860	that way on purpose or that we would ever wish this, but it's just the way the cards,
6812860	6816620	it was a silver lining. It was a blessing in disguise. And in this case, it looks like it's
6816620	6821820	going to be an even bigger financial blessing for Nintendo, but, you know, again, on the personal
6821820	6827980	side, it's been a blessing for the players. Absolutely. So it's brought people together
6827980	6833100	in a way that they couldn't. And as you say, it's, it's more the mainstream financial press
6833100	6836540	that's picking this up now. Like it's not just, we're saying, Oh, some blog is say this is,
6836540	6840380	you know, what investors Bloomberg has, what investors look at. And on top of that,
6840380	6845260	isn't Bloomberg, um, more conservative leaning as well. So to hear positive things from,
6845260	6850460	you know, from Bloomberg about video games, their owner ran for the democratic nomination. So hard
6850460	6856700	to say. Yeah. I might be thinking of Forbes. Yeah. And Forbes also runs a lot of clickbait.
6856700	6861820	So I don't like if they run the article, I don't know. And they, yes, they're because, uh, that
6861820	6866300	guy ran for Republican governor once, but it doesn't matter. Uh, the reality is Forbes has
6866300	6870860	a lot of clickbait trash on their site. Sorry. Not sorry, but that's what it is. And, um, you know,
6870860	6876620	this is a little more of the mainstream press. Exactly. Okay. Neat. What else?
6876700	6883500	Yeah. Um, well, and also, um, I don't, I really don't know anyone who is still playing this. Um,
6883500	6887180	so I guess this is actually maybe not be a big deal, but I know a lot of people still
6887180	6894940	love to Pokemon rumble rush. Um, they are shutting it down on, uh, July 2nd, 2020. Um,
6895740	6905020	that's, uh, been confirmed by, um, uh, Saturday who, um, I believe is hold on just a second.
6907020	6913340	Yes. Uh, said it'd be.net, um, who basically follows a Pokemon news has, uh, got confirmation
6913340	6920860	on it that, um, buying, uh, the purchase of Poke diamonds in the game. Um, it has been disabled.
6920860	6927020	The unused diamonds in the game will be refunded when the game shuts down. So that's at 1 59 AM UTC
6927020	6933340	on July 2nd, 2020. That means that the game was only on the market for just over a year.
6933340	6937980	And I must admit, I forgot that rumble rush was even a thing. So I probably did not help
6937980	6942220	this situation, but, uh, sorry to those that are fans of the game. Um, but it was,
6942220	6945420	it was probably like, uh, when it comes to Pokemon and the mobile devices, I mean,
6945420	6950380	Pokemon go is really, you know, the royalty thing it's, it's, it's going to be hard to compete. Any
6950380	6955500	other Pokemon game kind of has to compete against itself. You know, I realized they're very
6955500	6960860	different in how they play, but you know, there's still Pokemon, right? Yeah. And well, I mean,
6961100	6965580	we know what the shit is, right? Yeah. So, all right. Well, this is the part of the show where
6965580	6971100	we travel around the world and check out release dates. Um, I mean, cause we always have, but I
6971100	6974780	know it's probably a little smaller just because of what's going on in the world, but I will ask
6974780	6980620	anyway. Uh, Loki, do we have any U S releases this week? Uh, yeah, we have a few things. So,
6980620	6986700	uh, starting off, we've got Azure Striker gun volt Striker pack coming out on PlayStation four.
6987420	6994140	We've got, um, Boku Jaime project. That's going to be on Nintendo switch and PlayStation four,
6995020	7002940	Moto GP 20 on PC, Nintendo switch PlayStation four X-Box one and Stadia, uh, Picross S4 on
7002940	7009820	Nintendo switch. We have Naruto Shippuden ultimate Ninja storm four road to burrito.
7010780	7017260	Uh, it looks like predator hunting grounds on PC and PlayStation four, uh, trials of Mana on
7017260	7023980	PC and it's in the switch and PlayStation four. And last but not least, uh, X-Com chimera squad
7023980	7031020	on PC. All right. Well, traveling over to Japan, boy, it was really slow in Japan last week,
7031020	7035020	but this week is making up for it. There's a lot of new releases. Now, uh, things are picking up
7035020	7038860	again again, though. I don't know how the current situation may affect some of these releases,
7038860	7043100	but the information we have as of today are that these games are coming out in Japan this week on
7043100	7048540	April 23rd on the Nintendo switch, uh, Naruto Shippuden ultimate Ninja storm four is coming
7048540	7055100	out this week, uh, as well as super real mahjong love two through seven. That's clearly a mahjong
7055100	7059500	collection of sorts is out this week. Little busters converted edition is out this week.
7059500	7063580	Uh, that Boku Jaime project that Loki mentioned for the U S is also out in Japan this week.
7063580	7069500	Celeste gets a physical release, uh, in Japan this week, uh, little town hero as well. And
7069500	7074860	enter the Gungeon gets a Japanese release as well as Metro redo. Uh, all of this on the switch,
7074860	7082140	Moto GP 20. And this game sounds awesome. B simulator is out on the switch this week.
7082140	7086860	Is this a game that's been out over here for a while? Yeah. Oh, I got a, is it, is it good?
7086860	7092380	It looks really pretty for the, and it's kind of, it looks neat. I I've actually browsed it at the
7092380	7097020	store several times. So like, should I pick this up? But I need to look into this. Well,
7097020	7102540	I'm going to, I'm going to read the description, see the world through the eyes of a bee compete
7102540	7106460	with other bees in race. That would be kind of like, unfortunately it isn't actually showing
7106460	7111980	you what a bee would see, uh, compete with other bees in races, collect pollen, perform waggle
7111980	7118140	dances and explore a world inspired by central park in New York. I had no idea B simulator was
7118140	7123100	a thing. Oh, the fact that's near central park and it has to do with bees reminds me it's,
7123100	7129580	I'm getting too many bee movie vibes. Well, that's what that was. Can you, can you narrate bee movie
7129580	7132940	while you play bee simulator? That's what I want to know. All right. Anyway,
7133500	7137260	that is all good. Anything's possible. Anything's possible. Anyway, that's all on the Nintendo
7137260	7142620	switch. I hope, I hope it's not one of the things where it's like, it sounds awesome. And then it's,
7142620	7147820	it's garbage. It's shovelware. I really, my hopes are high for bee simulator. Let's just put it that
7147820	7153820	way. Um, and on the PlayStation four this week, also bee simulator, Celeste Boku Hime project,
7153820	7159820	a lot of the same games, um, Anoatsu line, uh, is out this week as well as zombie army four dead
7159820	7166860	war, uh, Azure striker gun volt is out this week and, uh, trials of mana, uh, coinciding with the
7166860	7171500	us and around the world on April 24th on the PlayStation four. And I might've missed that
7171500	7176220	on the switch, but that should be the same on the switch as well. Yes it is. Well, it's an average
7176220	7186380	of 6.5 on the, uh, well 65 on Metacritic. So that's too bad. That's too bad. All right.
7186380	7193980	Uh, let's move on. Uh, dark soccer. How about the UK? So going on in the UK, a whopping three games
7193980	7202380	we have, um, on 22nd of April, MotoGP 2020 on a PlayStation, Xbox switch and PC. We have deliver
7202380	7208780	us the moon on, uh, the 23rd of April for PlayStation, Xbox and PC, and then on PlayStation
7208780	7217020	and switch on the 23rd trials of mana. That's it. All right. Sad trombone expected. It's a little
7217020	7220780	slow with the releases right now with everything else going on in the world. But, uh, I know even
7220780	7224700	if it's, even if it's getting a not so great reviews, I know a lot of people are looking
7224700	7228380	forward to that trials of manna. So there is that. All right. In this part of the show,
7228380	7233260	we would typically go to our mailbag, participate at orangelandradio.com and read the emails,
7233260	7237180	but I don't think we have any this week. At least last I checked, we didn't. We have no
7237180	7243660	none after I cleaned out the leftover face. All right. Participate at orangelandradio.com is the
7243660	7248620	place to send emails. If you would like to have your opinions or your, your, your thoughts read
7248620	7256140	on a future week's show. So we'll get back into some more news. So Loki. All right. So, um, we
7256140	7261500	talked about this a little bit before they, where they had a steam games festival. I want to say
7261500	7267660	that was back in March or something, um, where it's basically a bunch of demos and whatnot
7267660	7271900	that are put up by independent developers. So you can check out their games. Yeah. Kind of
7271900	7277900	replaced GDC. If I remember, it was kind of the, the, yeah. Yeah. So, um, because we are lacking
7277900	7283100	an E3 this year, they're going to be doing a steam games festival summer edition from
7283100	7288380	June 9th through the 14th. And they have registrations up now for developers to submit
7288380	7293660	games for that as well. Um, so it could be, you know, limited time demos, short playable
7293660	7298300	experiences, uh, allows you to actually, you know, connect with developers and whatnot.
7298940	7303660	Plus you can wishlist any of the games that you see there. So, uh, that's pretty cool. I didn't
7303660	7308540	get a chance to check it out last time during GDC. So I'm hoping that this time I can actually play
7308540	7313740	some of these things, uh, because there were some that were mixed in there for the GDC one that,
7313740	7317340	um, were actually games I was looking forward to checking out. So we'll have to see.
7318780	7323260	Yeah. I love the idea of a virtual expo that we can all participate in. If nothing else,
7323260	7326860	um, I'm sure it'll be primarily a lot of indie titles, but there's a lot of great
7326860	7333420	indie titles. So why not? It'll be a really good thing. So, uh, and, uh, Jeff Keeley being involved
7333420	7339980	it's interesting too. So, yeah, we'll see how that goes. All right. Uh, moving on talking about,
7339980	7344060	uh, you know, earlier I talked about how Japan is making Nintendo switches again,
7344060	7349580	and it does seem like everywhere Nintendo switch is having a shortage and, uh, bots apparently
7349580	7353420	are to blame for some of this. This was something that was linked in our discord server, actually.
7353420	7358780	So thank you guys for sharing the story over at vognetwork.com slash discord, where we do pull
7358780	7364300	some of our stories from, uh, what you guys want to hear about. Um, so there's actually the story
7364300	7368780	that vice, uh, was running with. That's talking about how there is a bot out there that was built
7368780	7375020	for discord, uh, that somebody built, uh, that really it wasn't originally built for the switch
7375020	7378700	because there's all these other like markets where they try to buy things up and resell them.
7378700	7384060	Sneakers is what this was really made for. Um, but the switch seemed like a opportune market.
7384060	7388620	So it was used, uh, for this as well. And of course, uh, in this day and age,
7388620	7392940	a lot of folks are, uh, looking for Nintendo switches to help
7392940	7398860	fill time with kids around and not a lot to do at home outside of virtual studies.
7398860	7403660	So it's kind of driving up the demand for a switch. So resellers are looking to make a quick buck.
7403660	7410540	Um, obviously the easiest way to stop resellers for being successful would be to stop buying.
7410540	7416540	But I think the reality is you have a lot of families, uh, that don't understand and that
7416540	7421100	are just like, I need this. So I'm going to spend all this money because maybe they have
7421100	7425740	more disposable money to then turn around to these people who are flipping these things.
7425740	7431660	And there's a discord bot that is actually running a lot of this, uh, where they, you can actually
7431660	7437580	buy through discord and it kind of does a lot of the process for you so that you don't have to like
7437580	7441980	go in and fill out your address and all that stuff by hand. These bots are kind of tailored
7441980	7447420	to the websites to move them, move through them for you. Um, I would wish that these retailers
7447420	7451740	would limit how many of this stuff you can buy. And I imagine they probably do. And there's
7451740	7456140	probably ways that these guys have worked around that as well. So I don't want to say like, Oh,
7456140	7460220	they haven't thought of it because I'm sure a lot of these retailers are trying to think of ways to
7460220	7464780	combat this as well. Cause the reselling market doesn't always look good for them either. Um,
7464780	7470460	but the reality is it hasn't happened yet. Um, but what I think is just crazy about this and also
7470460	7475740	kind of sad is that what's happening in the discord server, people are trying to capitalize
7475740	7480700	on the stimulus payments that just went out this week. Uh, one apparent reseller in the discord
7480700	7485180	said quote, yeah, mine are taking so long to deliver. I want them to hurry up while everyone
7485180	7492860	still has some money. So people hoping to make all that, you know, get, get that stimulus money,
7492860	7500060	uh, to buy upsold Nintendo switch again, obviously these folks can't be stopped.
7500060	7505660	They're just going to change the technology to match whatever the websites do to stop them.
7505660	7512220	It would be great if the stores would only allow one per address, but I also realize, you know,
7512220	7516540	people are probably buying them for pickup. They put them in kids' names. They have go to other
7516540	7520540	places. They probably have all these ideas they do to work around them. So what we really need to do
7520540	7525500	is stop supporting the resale market because that's ultimately what's going to dry it up.
7525500	7531260	But the reality is you and me are not the ones that are driving that market up.
7531900	7537500	So we have to help spread the word that the, thank you, that the reasons are Alan just for the,
7537500	7541740	on the podcast, Alan just brought me a drink. Thank you. Um, oh wait, they're not paying for
7541740	7546140	advertisement. Why am I putting their label forward? Um, here, look at the nutrition facts.
7546140	7552060	Um, so, uh, yeah, we have to stop supporting the resale market and then they'll stop doing this.
7552060	7561500	But until then, this is unfortunately part of it. So anyway, let's move on. Hopefully you're to
7561500	7565100	happier news. Actually. Yes. I think this story is very cool. Dark Sakura.
7566380	7573020	Yeah. So, um, and now it is kind of hit or miss cool in my opinion. And I'll tell you
7573100	7580300	after I've announced it. So, um, the Getty, um, as in the Getty center, um, you know, art,
7580300	7585820	all of that, um, basically they have a tool, um, called the animal crossing art generator,
7585820	7591500	which you can pick out one of your favorite works of art, crop it down and auto-generated QR code
7591500	7595980	that you can use in new horizons using the switch online mobile, uh, tool, you know,
7595980	7600540	using the switch online tool. And it's pretty cool. So you can get it through your milk link.
7600540	7608780	Um, now the one thing that I do not like, um, is that it really isn't very clear at all. Um,
7609580	7613580	it looks like blurs on the wall, really. So, I mean, you get the concept of the art way. I mean,
7613580	7617340	and then again, it is pretty neat, you know, it's a great thing. I think that I used, um,
7617340	7622620	the pattern maker tool in conjunction with this one. Um, and they also have like their full step
7622620	7626460	by step walkthrough on how to get you through that for people who haven't done this before.
7627340	7635180	Um, but really, um, it's a good way for people to, I guess, expose more, more natural art out
7635180	7641020	there. Now I did open up and take a look through the Getty museums, um, uh, art generator.
7641020	7645180	They didn't have any of the artists that I was interested in. I like, I looked for Frida Kahlo.
7645180	7652380	I looked for Banksy. I looked for some more, uh, you know, uh, uh, crap. What was her name? Uh,
7652380	7657580	Hannah, I always forget her name, but she actually was, um, one of the Weimar Bauhaus.
7657580	7660860	I could see if there's Mondrian, that would probably translate very well. Um,
7661660	7666620	but I mean, the thing is that, um, it's a good way to expose, uh, people to art, to have some
7666620	7671500	fine pieces of art in their own museum. There's no Mondrian. That's sad. Yeah. It is kind of a
7671500	7676940	limited, uh, search on here, but it is still pretty cool. It just doesn't come out very cleanly,
7676940	7682140	if that makes sense. Yeah. Um, and you know, I know some folks might be thinking, Oh God,
7682140	7686300	another animal crossing story. But I mean, this is like, when you have a museum,
7687900	7692940	well, and then when you have a museum embracing that part of pop culture to try to get more people
7692940	7696940	interested in what the museum does, the art, I kind of think that's extremely newsworthy.
7696940	7701980	Don't you? Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. And especially to the links, like the fact that
7701980	7706380	they are, it's not just like, Oh, T he, somebody set up a fit. It's like, no, the museum is
7706780	7712540	getting these QR codes for you to put in your town. And yeah, I mean, the QR code stuff is
7712540	7718300	limited. Like I have a picture of Mr. Smoosh in Smoosh land, but, um, and when you see it,
7718300	7722460	it's grainy and it's not that great, but it gets the point across. And I think that's what this is
7722460	7729020	for too. If it starts a conversation about art, then it's a win. Right. So I think it's pretty
7729020	7734380	cool, but yeah, probably, probably very limited on what they have the rights to reproduce in this
7734380	7738860	manner. Um, although it would be cool to, you know, a lot of that stuff that you're talking
7738860	7743500	about would be very cool. Um, Marissa, uh, Marissa's in our chat. It's so good to see you
7744380	7748220	saying, uh, you could probably get an idea of what would be available by checking out the Getty
7748220	7753260	museum collections online. Yeah. And then, you know, if it drives you to their website to get
7753260	7757900	these QR codes, then you're exploring the museum in a sense, or you're thinking about, Oh, maybe
7757900	7763180	I want to see this art in real life and all that good stuff. Yeah, exactly. So win, win all around,
7763180	7767420	especially when museums are probably hurting right now because they don't have foot traffic.
7767420	7772780	So, yeah. Anyway. All right, moving on, uh, just a few more stories and then, uh, we'll take a
7772780	7779500	listener round table questions in our chat room. Uh, let's move on to Loki. Yes. So, uh, one of the
7779500	7784860	things, I mean, we've been all waiting for the Minecraft, you know, uh, fancy graphics pack to
7784860	7790620	come out. And unfortunately, since, um, the 4k texture pack that was supposed to be coming out
7790620	7794380	Xbox one and PlayStation four, I think we're just Xbox one and PC at one point,
7794940	7801580	uh, got canceled. We had to kind of wait for the whole, uh, Minecraft RTX, um,
7802460	7808380	update to be coming out to actually add real ray tracing to the game. And so now they have that in
7808380	7816140	beta as well to actually check it out. So if you opt in through the, um, Xbox, uh, beta program
7816140	7824140	and actually get the, uh, Minecraft with RTX and happen to have a computer with an RTX, uh, GPU,
7824140	7830380	so, uh, RTX 2060 through 2080, uh, then you can actually check this game out. Um, they also,
7831260	7836540	what's unique about it though is because they're changing the way the graphics are set up in the
7836540	7842700	game, all the textures, um, they only have specific texture packs and maps that work with it right
7842700	7850380	now. So you, those are being offered for free as well. I happen to have a PC that can run RTX. And
7850380	7860060	so I did get to check that out this week. Well, lucky you, cause I don't, it, it looks really
7860060	7867500	cool. I mean, it really does look like a different game. Um, it's, it's interesting though, like some
7867500	7873260	of the, like just everything they have there, like the atmospheric lighting that's in there now
7873260	7878140	is just pretty incredible. Like if you actually go and try to go down into caves and stuff like that
7878140	7885020	with torches, like it doesn't illuminate very much and it gets extremely pitch black and, um, they
7885020	7890060	have surfaces now they can set up like mirrors. I mean, you, if you're swimming under water,
7890060	7895900	you see the reflection of everything under the water and the top of the water or the surface.
7895900	7903420	Um, just some incredible looking, um, graphics there, the god rays and everything. Um, and
7903420	7908460	actually runs pretty good on my laptop. So that's pretty cool. Um, you have to show it to me when
7908460	7913980	we can hang out again. Yes. Yes. I'll have to do that. Um, I did end up uninstalling it after I
7913980	7918460	played through for a little bit because it's not compatible with my realms and everything,
7918460	7924220	uh, because it's beta, but it's pretty cool. There were some glitches I ran into at one point where
7924220	7929980	stuff, uh, stop drawing in a little bit. So obviously it's in beta and they're working on
7929980	7934220	it, but it looks incredible. Like if this is something that maybe can be supported with the
7934220	7939020	next generation of consoles, I mean, I think people are going to be having a pretty good
7939020	7944940	time with it. So, um, definitely check it out. If you own Minecraft on PC and can get into this
7944940	7948860	beta program, which is pretty easy to do. I was going to say I was really f*****g bitter
7948860	7953100	that the super duper graphics pack kind of got scrapped. And then this came out instead
7953100	7960700	for a $500 graphics card that I don't own, but, um, it does seem very logical that the PC folks
7960700	7965020	and the folks playing this right now are the beta test crowd. And that where this is ultimately
7965020	7970860	going to end up is on the next X-Box and presumably PlayStation five. I mean, yes,
7970860	7976700	Minecraft is a Microsoft product, but they still kind of put stuff on switch and Sony. So, I mean,
7976700	7980220	assumably it'll be there too. It'd probably just come out later for PlayStation, but yeah,
7980220	7984700	they're going to have, I don't know if it would necessarily work on those consoles because their
7984700	7992300	GPU's are based around the ATI technology. So, uh, it's hard to say, or it's ATI is kind of
7992300	7998700	antiquated AMD technology, but, um, I, I would be interested to see if they can adapt it for that,
7998700	8002940	but like if they still have the groundwork for the stuff, then maybe it'll work or it'll come up.
8004940	8008220	Yeah. Cause when I heard it was like Ray tracing, I was like, Oh, well that's where the next,
8008220	8011580	that's what they keep talking about for the next series of consoles. So that seems like the logical
8011580	8016940	progression, but okay. Maybe not so easy then. Interesting. Okay. Bobby says in chat, uh, by
8016940	8021660	Blackwell says hardware Ray tracing is hardware Ray tracing the ATI cards will have it. They'll
8021660	8027980	just have to port it. So it won't be such a, maybe like easy type of transition, you know,
8027980	8032540	hopefully not too bad, but we'll see. All right. Yeah. I could, I could see support for it at some
8032540	8038940	point. All right. Lastly, but not leastly tonight, this is a story. What like, honestly,
8038940	8043100	what the fuck is going on with cookie mama? That is, that is what we're calling this segment.
8043100	8047740	What the fuck is going on with cookie mama? Because like there have been stories all over
8047740	8053900	the internet about cooking mama and it's, uh, that the, the cooking mama is mining Bitcoin.
8053900	8059180	Remember that one that was around like two weeks ago. Um, yeah, it's just a mess. And apparently,
8059580	8065020	mama, mama can't even fix her own damn game. Um, there's issues going on with cooking mama cook
8065020	8071180	star is the actual name of the game that just came out for switch. Well, sort of, um, the game's
8071180	8076860	license holder and the publisher are fighting online about who is controlling this. The original
8076860	8083580	developer of the DS game office create licensed cook star to planet entertainment in 2018.
8083580	8088140	Uh, they decided together on a game design and then it came out on the Nintendo switch in March
8088140	8093100	and then was pulled from the shelves because office create said it failed to meet the
8093100	8097580	standards its customers expect and deserve. So I guess it wasn't really mining Bitcoin.
8097580	8103820	It was just bad. So I don't know. Um, so what I understand, like I watched like a video of like,
8103820	8107420	what, what happened with that? Oh, did a YouTuber explain it in three hours?
8108460	8112940	No, there's, so there's this, um, there's a channel that I watched that they did explain.
8112940	8116700	It wasn't three hours. It was like a pretty short video, but they explained that, um,
8116700	8121500	the guy that works for that publishing company doesn't even really understand what Bitcoin is.
8121500	8127980	They just thought they'd drop blockchain in there that that would entice people cause it's tech and
8127980	8132460	everybody's talking about blockchain nowadays. I am sorry. I love this comment too much from
8132460	8137180	our chat. See a Tiberian chat says I was hoping it would be an accounting conspiracy. So it would
8137180	8148140	be cooking, cooking mama's books. Uh, funny. That's great. Uh, all right. Anyway, uh, yeah.
8148140	8152300	And Bobby Bakloff says, yes, same blockchain gets you investor funding. It sure does.
8152300	8158540	Uh, so anyway, office create is now saying legal action against planet is probably going to happen
8158540	8165660	to protect its customers. Uh, but planet doesn't give a fuck. They said on the official cook star
8165660	8170540	Twitter, uh, said that the issue has to do with creative differences. There is no active
8170540	8175100	litigation or ruling that prevents planet from publishing this game. Um, it may still come out
8175100	8180140	on the switch. This game is already turning into a huge collector's item, uh, for people to find
8180140	8189980	and so forth. Uh, this is crazy. So, wow. But anyway, cooking mama may not be the mama you
8189980	8194860	remember. Did you want to say something to me? No, I'm sorry. I didn't realize my mic wasn't
8194860	8202140	muted or typing what I was because I was, I was, uh, trying to do a, a, a well thought out
8202140	8207260	reply on actually something very similar. Um, Oh, see, there it went. Yeah. I am so sorry. I
8207260	8213180	didn't mean to just clack away cause that, that ain't me. Um, but anyway, um, I'm just like,
8213740	8220060	I keep thinking mama ain't fixing shit. You're going to have to fix this one for
8220060	8227980	your dance. Her wine break slam, you know, to quote, uh, that line by the, uh, uh, late great,
8227980	8234140	uh, now I can't think of her name, uh, be Arthur mama's on a cruise ship and she's stuck.
8234140	8240940	So mama's on a cruise ship with the COVID. Okay. Don't joke about that. All right. So
8240940	8246220	I'm not, well I am, but I'm also really mad at the cruise industry. So there's that. Um,
8247020	8252860	but, um, but I mean the thing is, is that it is a shit show from the beginning and
8254380	8259500	people are going to say what they're going to say. You know, the truth is there somewhere.
8259500	8262380	No, one's going to care what it is cause they still want to only believe what they want to
8262380	8268300	think. End of story. All right. Well let's, what is Mr. Smush? Can you, is that getting picked up
8268300	8274700	by the mic? Mr. Smush is like screaming over there. Yeah. Oh boy. All right. Anyway, uh,
8274780	8278460	let's move on. That was actually our last story that we have planned for tonight. So we're going
8278460	8283660	to open up the listener round table via our chat room over at twitch.tv slash a VOG network. So if
8283660	8288860	you have a question or something you want to ask on the show, uh, please go ahead and ask in the
8288860	8294300	chat and we'll get to it. Um, and yeah, everybody in chat is screaming about Mr. Smoosh. Yes.
8294300	8300380	So she wants to say something. I know he always, okay. He always does this after he uses the
8300380	8308220	litter box. Like he has to announce to the entire household. Exactly. Like, and that is what just
8308220	8313660	happened. I heard scratching noises and then I heard like now he's screaming. He doesn't have
8313660	8318540	a problem with his butt. I hope not. Um, I it's, it's kind of hard to say cause we can't really
8318540	8322860	take him to the vet or anything right now, but everything's normal in the litter box
8322860	8327020	in that department. So I don't think it's anything like that, but it's just catism.
8327020	8331580	My cat does the same thing. Every time she sees me, she screams at me every time.
8331580	8335260	Well, Midna's thing is that no matter if it's food time or not, she's still going to follow
8335260	8340060	you into that front bathroom. Cause that's where we feed her. And now Mr. Smoosh is just lying on
8340060	8345020	the kitchen floor. Like his entire world has ended because I guess he wants more food. So I don't
8345020	8350460	know. He just ate everybody. You know what I did today, Rob? Hmm. What's that? You know, I had
8350460	8358300	sashimi for dinner. Yes. Midna has had her first taste of sashimi. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. We, uh, Alan
8358300	8363100	feeds the cat all the time, all the time. Like just, just a little bit of human food, just a
8363100	8367100	little bit. And you know, appropriately like, you know, he, he, he's very good at taking care of
8367100	8372060	kitties. But like, for example, last night we tried a new barbecue place that we'd never had before
8372060	8378060	we did, uh, it was our date night. So we did, you know, delivery food and, um, we had a new bar,
8378060	8382860	like a local barbecue place we'd never had before. And, uh, Mr. Smoosh got to have just
8382860	8387660	a little bit, just a little bit of the barbecue chicken, just a little bit. So, but that's why
8387660	8393660	Mr. Smoosh is more chonk than he was when we, uh, adopted him as a rescue kitty. He was very skinny
8393660	8400380	then. Now he's chonk. I gave him Midna cheese a year ago and now she has like cheese radar. She
8400380	8406780	knows when it's actually cheese that's coming out, but she was all about the sushi, the sashimi.
8406780	8412220	Cause I can't have a lot of rice, even though I love rice. Um, so I just, Dan's like, get what
8412220	8416780	you want for your birthday dinner. And I'm like, sashimi. And so I gave Midna, eventually ate a
8416780	8423180	whole slice, like a whole ounce of fish. Uh, a question from DJ Rama S in our chat room. Uh,
8423180	8429340	what is the quarantine drink of choice right now? Mine is Tito's vodka and Pepsi cause Rite Aid was
8429340	8436620	out of Coke. Um, I don't do a lot of alcoholic drinking really. Um, but, um, we've been drinking
8436620	8442060	a lot more soda, which is bad because we're drinking like diet soda and Coke Zero and stuff
8442060	8447980	like, and I fully admit it's trash. We shouldn't be drinking them, but you want comfort food right
8447980	8452860	now in this whole circumstance. And I will say again, I guess I'm giving free advertising,
8452860	8457260	but it is what it is. Diet Coke has these different flavors right now that are really
8457260	8462220	good. Like they have a blood orange diet Coke. Um, and I love that one. It was weird to me.
8462220	8465900	I love that one, but I also really love the ginger lime and that's what we have,
8465900	8472620	um, a ton of right now. So, and Alan really likes the, um, orange vanilla Coke Zero. So there's a
8472620	8478700	lot of like diet Coke, terrible products in our house. Um, but which is weird because I'm usually
8478700	8483820	a Pepsi person. So if it's, if it's non diet, I prefer Pepsi, but if it's diet, I prefer Coke.
8483820	8490060	Isn't that weird? But it's what it is. Yeah. Yeah. But I, um, like here though, it's been,
8490060	8495900	um, I really love dietary Pepsi. Um, but right now we just have diet Coke cause our diet diet
8495900	8500060	Coke, because that's what Dan found at seven 11, which happened to be open after nine. Everything
8500060	8506940	else is not. Um, but, um, you know, like I said, I was gifted that bottle of, uh, Godiva chocolate
8506940	8513340	liquor. Um, and I forgot about my very loaded bar that I have because I kept wanting to experiment
8513420	8518860	with beverages after watching cocktail chemistry. So I have, you know, I have vermouth, I have gin
8518860	8526060	in my freezer. I have, um, the Nika coffee grain whiskey that my bestie got me for, uh, holidays.
8526700	8532940	Um, I have larceny, uh, bourbon, which is also really good. It's a non rye. I don't like
8532940	8538380	practically anything right. Um, I've also got Kraken, which makes every diet soda taste like
8538380	8547260	an oatmeal cookie, which is amazing. I have Tuaka. I have, um, crap. I have, um, Grand Marnier,
8547260	8551180	which I'm actually thinking of taking the Godiva and the Grand Marnier and make myself a chocolate
8551180	8557980	orange. Um, I have a creme de mint. I have creme de cacao, which I usually use baking. So I don't
8557980	8565660	have the best quality. Um, yeah. Um, I also have, uh, a thing, uh, I have some brandy.
8565660	8570540	I also have some Hennessy left a little bit of Hennessy. Um, I have a touch of a bit of
8570540	8575740	hypnotic left in my fridge. I have a Pinot Noir rosé. I've got like two bottles of wine. That's
8575740	8580940	it. Uh, let me, let me quickly read some comments from chat. Cause now you're, now you're, now you're
8580940	8589260	sounding like a, a Bubba gun shrimp in this and shrimp in this all your alcohol. I'm just saying
8589260	8595900	when I've had the, when I've had the, the wild urge, I've got to hook up. Now I have the Godiva,
8595900	8600060	which is what I really wanted. Marissa's in our chat saying the guava one, I think talking about
8600060	8605500	the diet soda is awesome. Leave me my one vice diet cancer. That's how I feel. Like, look,
8605500	8609500	you can sit there and tell me about how diet soda is horrible for you. And my answer is,
8609500	8615500	bitch, I know, but these are trying times. And if a diet soda is going to make me happy,
8615500	8621980	let me fucking live. Okay. Like we'll, we'll address the caking the diet soda habit after
8621980	8626700	we get on the other side of this. Okay. That's, that's what I'm leaving it as. Um, and then, uh,
8626700	8631980	there was some other comments I wanted to say here. Um, let's see, uh, Meesh in our chat says
8631980	8636460	our drink of choice has been chocolate Coca-Cola. Ooh, that's really good too. It's good. Chocolate
8636460	8641660	Coke. Yeah. Um, well there's, I, um, there's definitely chocolate Cola out there and I feel
8641660	8646140	like chocolate Coke is a thing. I don't know if it's something in America though,
8646140	8650540	you'll have to ask me where they're getting that. Now I have to tell you, I can't drink sugary Coke
8650540	8655340	like at all. Cause it just tastes too clean to me. But that, uh, strawberry Coke that they had
8655340	8662780	in Japan and the peach Coke and me who does not like peach, peach Coke was good. Uh, Ziba in chat
8662780	8667180	says we've been drinking a lot of different flavors of spindrift. Uh, and some folks talking
8667180	8671180	about Jackbox games and kind of using that to pass the time right now. A lot of people doing that on
8671660	8676540	Zoom. And some folks have asked if we're going to do a vog game night of sorts. And the answer is,
8676540	8681260	um, yeah, I guess we need to plan something like that. Don't we? Um, I still want to do the Amazon
8681260	8686540	watch party on my personal channel, but the selections are so limited. Like I don't know
8686540	8692300	what I would stream. I'm like there's old seasons of survivor, but the problem with streaming those
8692300	8696620	is that you kind of like already know who's going to go. So I don't know if it's as exciting, but
8696620	8701900	I did. I did consider old seasons of America's next top model because I don't know those as
8701900	8707580	well. So there would still be surprises in them. Uh, and maybe actually the actual season. I have
8707580	8713420	to see if they have that season that I always reference here on OLR with Tiffany with the,
8713420	8717340	we were rooting for you. We were all rooting for you. I feel like that should be the thing maybe
8717340	8724380	that I should stream if they have that season. So VG realness says, OMG bitch America's next top
8724380	8729020	model. I would be there for, so, okay. Maybe, maybe that's going to be the show. Maybe I'll
8729020	8735180	do some, uh, uh, chairside watching of the season with Tiffany on it. Was that season four?
8735180	8739580	Go back to the drink thing real quick. You know what is not in my house? Fucking La Croix.
8743260	8748540	Shit's nasty. I love it. I love it. All right. Uh, I think that's going to do it for the listener.
8748540	8753180	Uh, round table tonight. Thank you guys very much for the, uh, uh, comments and all that. You know,
8753180	8756860	you guys always make this a good time. Really appreciate you guys being here and hanging out
8756860	8760620	with us on a Sunday night. Um, keeping us going through these really tough times. Really
8760620	8765500	appreciate it. You know what we didn't do? Cause we had no emails. We didn't do drag race talk.
8765500	8770540	Well, cause I'm not watching drag race this season. What? Yeah, I'm not. I I'm taking a
8770540	8772460	drag race and I are seeing other people for a little bit.
8775180	8778860	We have some last minute story. Yeah, no. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What do you, what do you want to
8778860	8784220	say for last minute stories, Loki? Um, so let's talk a little bit about, uh, Riot Games purchasing
8784220	8791820	Hytale and, um, the developers of Hypixel studios, or I should say their, their developer Hypixel
8791820	8795900	studios. So Hytale, if you may remember, we talked about a little bit before, um,
8795900	8802300	it's sort of like a Minecraft game mixed with a little bit more RPG elements. Um, so it's gonna
8802300	8810140	be interesting and see what they do with that. Um, so that's supposed to be, um, really the game
8810140	8815660	is still not yet out, but it's supposed to be released sometime in 2021. Um, we talked a little
8815660	8821500	bit about, uh, HD rat remasters of some classic games. Well, guess what? We talked about this
8821500	8829500	before, but it's right around the corner now. So, um, checks quest HD is, um, going to be coming
8829500	8836060	out on steam. Apparently it is going to be a free to play game when it comes out as well. Oh joy.
8837100	8840220	If you want to, you know, check it out. Uh, it's going to be launching this summer
8841500	8846700	and then hard to complain about free, I guess. And checks, checks, miss checks,
8846700	8850220	mix is pretty good. And like, they're not even paying me to say that. So like,
8850220	8858380	it's just legit something I I'm craving now. Damn it. And speaking of, uh, free, uh, Sony has,
8858380	8863900	um, offered, um, I guess a couple of things for the folks that are staying home because of the
8863900	8868860	whole COVID-19 thing. So they're offering uncharted, the Nathan Drake collection and
8868860	8874460	journey for free on PlayStation four, regardless if you have PlayStation plus or not.
8874460	8877980	Somebody brought that up in chat and I forgot who I'm sorry. Somebody brought that up in chat
8877980	8880860	during the classic game of the week. And I was going to say something when we came back,
8880860	8885100	but then my brain was so fixated on F zero. I forgot, but thank you for mentioning that.
8885340	8891020	And, and to stress, you do not need PlayStation plus for this. They are like free for all game.
8891020	8895100	And of course, everybody was complaining when I, everybody, but people on Twitter who are
8895100	8899820	loud and annoying were complaining. Uh, would you already gave us these games? No, no. These
8899820	8905980	are free games for everybody. Plus or no plus. So a journey and uncharted collection. And, uh,
8905980	8913180	until May 1st. Right. Um, I believe it's until I just closed the page, um, May 5th.
8913180	8916220	Okay. Close, but go, go get them now. What are you waiting for? Go get them now.
8916220	8921260	Store, store.playsation.com. You can just log in right there at 8 PM Pacific. So,
8921260	8928540	you know, get on that. There you go. Is that it? All right. Free, free games is a good note to end
8928540	8933420	on a hype. Mayhem would be very proud if he's out there listening. Uh, anyhow, uh, that brings us
8933420	8936540	towards the end of the show. I really want to thank you guys for tuning in and listening
8936540	8940780	tonight. Really appreciate you guys being here. Uh, whether you were listening live over at Twitch
8940780	8945180	TV, where we record on Sunday night, or if you were listening on our podcast feed, which is
8945180	8950700	available, of course, on iTunes, Google podcasts, Spotify, pretty much all of the big places where
8950700	8956620	you can get podcasts, except for one. Um, you can, uh, listen to this show and leave a nice
8956620	8960860	review or something like that. Cause those things go a long way. Tell a friend about the show,
8960860	8963820	help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
8963820	8967900	but if the voices aren't here to put them out on air, then we don't really get to have every voice
8967900	8973980	now, do we? Uh, and, uh, again, for those of you that are on Twitch, an auto host of VOG Network,
8973980	8977340	oh my gosh, that's like the absolute best thing you could do. And we really appreciate it.
8977340	8981580	We also definitely appreciate all the follows, the biddies and the subs. I will get to those
8981580	8985260	after the show, as I always do. If you didn't already see your shout out tickle on the bottom
8985260	8989260	of the screen. Uh, but I just want to say an extra special thank you to all of that. Uh, really,
8989260	8994380	really do appreciate all of you that go the extra mile. Uh, I think we should now wrap up and start
8994380	8999020	to get people's final thoughts. Um, I will start my final thought. I don't usually go first. I'll
8999020	9003420	start with my final thought. My final thought tonight is, um, I didn't get into my discussion
9003420	9008460	on this because I talked about it enough on Bobby's show tonight, but I will just simply say
9009340	9016540	stop spreading articles around that are farming you for hate clicks. Stop sharing hate porn.
9017420	9023660	Start sharing nice porn. I don't know a nice way to phrase that, but we'll leave it at that. Okay.
9023660	9029340	Stop sharing hate porn. Start sharing just porn. All right. Anyway, uh, Loki, what's your final
9029340	9034860	thought tonight? My final thought is I'm hopefully going to work on my game this week. I really tried
9034860	9043180	to get to that point. Um, but got very distracted. So I do want to get back into the groove of
9043180	9048860	working. It's just, it's been hard because I don't have the routine of going to like my son's coding
9048940	9053660	class and sitting down and doing it once in a while. So it's, I need to get back into it.
9053660	9059420	And I think even more frequent, like every day if I can. All right. Uh, last but not least,
9059420	9064780	the one and only dark soccer. Your final thought. This is more continuous talking than I've done,
9064780	9070700	uh, like in a week. And I actually am feeling kind of okay. So I'm actually sitting here
9070700	9076220	kind of happy and I have carrot cake waiting for me. Well, I hope you had a wonderful birthday dark
9076220	9081100	soccer. And when we can we'll celebrate and I imagine celebration will somehow involve
9081820	9089580	liquor, drag queens, cheesecake. Sound good? That sounds pretty epic to me. I'm down. All
9089580	9093660	right. Sounds good. Uh, thank you, captain Pikachu for sitting in on cam because Loki
9093660	9098780	and dark soccer can't join me in studio. Uh, so, uh, thank you captain Pikachu for being here.
9098780	9104860	Uh, hopefully, uh, we'll get beat, get to all be in person, uh, at some point, but we'll do it
9104860	9108860	when the governor says it's safe to do it, um, because the governor's listening to scientists
9108860	9116780	and, um, scientists are awesome. Uh, stay safe, everybody. Um, you know, again, I know it's been
9116780	9121340	going over a month now and people are starting to go a little crazy and like wanting to, but remember
9121340	9129500	we're doing this for a reason. Um, stay, stay at home, play video games, pass the time, uh, Zoom,
9129500	9137100	Jack box, uh, visit your friends virtually MMOs, animal crossing, whatever it is, uh, hang in there.
9137100	9141260	We'll get to the other side of this. Just, you know, you just got to stay put for a little while
9141260	9145340	longer. So we'll, uh, we'll stay put and keep doing this show every Sunday for you guys. In
9145340	9149900	the meantime, we will see you in seven days next week. I'll finish final fantasy seven
9149900	9153660	remake by then. So I'm really hoping I'll have some things to say, have a wonderful week.
9153660	9160540	Everybody good night. You've been listening to orange lounge radio. Orange lounge radio is a
