0	18160	This week the headlines continue to have an unsurprising theme and I spent all my creativity
18160	21320	in the bump the live listeners just cringed over. I hope you're safe and have a supply
21320	24760	of healthy foods and fun games to play in these times. We've always been remote from
24760	30120	you so please continue to enjoy the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio
32200	36200	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where
36200	42280	every gamer has a voice it is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 814 for this
42280	48840	April the 15th excuse me April the 5th not 15th getting ahead of myself of 2020. My name is Rob
48840	53000	Roberts joining you here live of course with everything that's going on in the world we are
53000	57480	still doing the social distance thing so it's just me in the studio tonight usually my co-host
57480	63240	would be here live in studio with me instead I'm joined by Captain Pikachu and via discord we have
63240	70200	welcome back tonight please DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Hello. Hi I hear that you're doing a lot
70200	77720	better? Yeah I'm doing better enough that they deem I can work tomorrow morning if I can ever get
77720	84520	the stuff I need from my work computer set up here at the house but yeah my I had a chest
84520	91800	x-ray and it came out clear they should have given me the chest x-ray three weeks ago but you know
91800	100280	it is what it is so she thinks that the breathing problems I have left over just inflammation from
100280	107240	having had pneumonia. Wow so but you never did find out if it was the big one or not just because
107320	114680	the testing shortage right? Exactly and I probably won't get to find out until they have the antigen
114680	119080	test ready. Well whatever way you slice it I'm really glad to hear you're feeling a lot better
119080	122360	because I know that was kind of you know if you go back and listen to that show it was about three
122360	127080	weeks ago or so when you were first calling in and you were you were feeling sick you you really
127080	130040	didn't sound good so I'm really glad to hear you're you're doing a lot better really really
130040	133800	happy to hear it and I know a lot of folks over in our twitch chat are cheering you on as well
133800	137800	because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock pacific nine o'clock eastern
137800	142840	at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network right after of course the Bobby
142840	147560	Blackwolf show. Also joining me in studio though I want to talk about Bobby's show tonight actually
147560	151640	with who else is also joining me excuse me on discord not in studio we'll usually be in studio
151640	156440	but not tonight say hello to tech master Loki our virtual studio say hello to Loki.
157320	163320	I was gonna say I'm not there. Yeah in spirit or I've been in quarantine for three weeks now
163400	167800	where Pikachu is just starting to look like Loki I don't know what it is maybe I don't know how
167800	174280	are you doing Loki? It's the jaundice it must be the jaundice. Clearly how are you doing? I'm fine.
174280	179560	So Bobby's show tonight he had a really big night because he had Tommy Tallarico on tonight who is
179560	186600	the CEO of Intellivision and I don't did you hear the whole interview Loki? No I like how like the
186600	190440	last five minutes. Oh bummer you should have heard the whole thing because there was a point where
190440	196280	Bobby actually brought up some of the things we had talked about on OLR before so and I won't
196280	200120	repeat everything because I know Bobby's want to get that interview out there but Tommy actually
200120	205400	addresses some of those things about the whole like remember the the no 3d games thing although
205400	210920	that's not really what it is he kind of clarifies that quite a bit and then he talks about the whole
212120	216680	average score thing which I guess people interpreted to be a 70 score a metacritic
216680	221160	but it's actually like an internal type of rating like think Nintendo CL quality type of thing
221160	226760	but anyway it was it was a good interview Bobby and Tommy had a lot of conversation and Tommy's
226760	232600	great he's a great salesman pitching his product and makes a lot of good cases for the Amico and
232600	241400	I can say I put down the deposit on one Thursday so I'm excited to check it out. I looked at it but
241800	247240	I don't know I don't know if I'm gonna do that. All right well it's I can also understand who's
247240	250200	one of those things where you got to get your hands on the games that the games are the important
250200	254520	part and I thought it was interesting how he kind of said like he actually said this may not
254520	258040	really be or this is what I heard anyway sorry I don't want to I don't want to misattribute a quote
258040	262040	or anything but kind of the message I was hearing was you know if you're like a hardcore gamer this
262040	266680	may not really be the thing for you like that's not the thing that we're designing it for so
266680	270760	that's the message I heard anyway so I thought that was interesting that you know he did have
270760	274680	that kind of like realistic approach like he definitely knows the audience he's going for and
275240	277800	I think it's I think it's very interesting he makes a good case when he kind of says
278360	284920	your your best memories in gaming are usually when you're together in the same room you know you
284920	288600	think back to days of like you know playing Mario Kart or things that you would play like in the
288600	292200	same room those are your great gaming memories and he wants to be able to bring those back and
292200	296840	when was the last time you were able to play a game with your family members your parents your
296840	300920	you know extended family members probably Wii Sports or something like that so I thought I
300920	305240	thought he made some really good arguments for the direction the console is going I thought it
305240	311240	was really good so so props to him and also I I have no idea if Tommy's still watching you
311240	316520	probably turned it off by now but uh kind of an interesting little aside about Tommy and
316520	321720	video games live specifically uh video games live and not everybody maybe necessarily knows
321720	325720	I think I might have mentioned it once before on the show but video games live is actually where I
325720	330840	met my husband Alan for the first time we knew each other online like on a blogging site years
330840	335720	and years ago but it was actually due to video games live that we met face to face for the first
335720	338680	time there was a chance meeting we didn't know that the other was going to be there it was one
338680	343800	of those type of oh you're oh you're that and it kind of like things proceeded from there as they
343800	349640	say so I do I do have Tommy to thank for that for creating video games live because if I hadn't had
349640	355800	that chance meeting who knows what would happen so um pretty cool anyhow let's get into uh and I
355800	359640	will just say tune into Bobby's show for the rest of it it was it was a good interview and I know
359640	365960	he's putting that up on youtube as well as his podcast feed usually um the video content here
365960	369640	at vog network we kind of see that as something extra because we've been doing these podcasts for
369640	375400	a long time 15 years 18 years uh we've been doing podcasting a long time so the audio podcast they're
375400	378680	out there free as they have always been but when we made the move to twitch we thought you know
378680	383160	video is something extra so we're gonna put that uh with the subscribe subscription thing and most
383160	388840	of you have a twitch prime uh account anyway so you get one free subscription uh excuse me amazon
388840	393560	prime um account so you get a free twitch prime subscription every month so if you consider using
393560	398760	that at vog network you get access to the whole video library but because uh this is such a big
398760	403400	thing and and there's really important news uh and things to be seen tommy did really show off
403400	406920	that controller and kind of it was showing it from all angles and stuff so there is kind of a
407000	411800	video component to that so he's gonna put that on youtube for free so that way it's not gated
411800	416280	because uh we don't want to be we don't want to be absolute uh jerks here at vog network and we don't
416280	420920	want to put the good stuff behind the paywall we're not we're not the la times putting all the
420920	426600	good stuff behind the paywall anyway let's move into tonight's kickoff topic something else a
426600	431400	little different going on in the gaming world um obviously with all the news around us we've got
431400	437480	things that are being cancelled moved shifted and all that stuff left and right and uh loki
437480	442360	e3 kind of or lack thereof providing some uh different moving and shaking this week right
442360	449000	loki right i mean so it's kind of expected that a lot of stuff around e3 well e3 already being
449000	457000	cancelled um is being postponed or cancelled as well so to go along with e3 as um we've had in
457000	462760	the past few years uh bethesda won't be doing their digital event around june um so they're
462760	469640	working on some alternate plans as well um to go along with that though we've got ign announcing
469640	475320	that they're going to be doing their own digital event called the summer of gaming uh it's supposed
475320	482360	to be a collaboration between several different companies 2k square enix sega bandai namco amazon
482360	491480	google stadia twitter developer digital thq nordic and more companies and you know they're
491480	497000	basically going to have some sort of event that's gonna be kind of i guess showing off some games
497000	505080	maybe some of the footage that we would have gotten during e3 but aren't getting um no deadline
505080	509400	or no exact date on when that's gonna happen but i'm assuming sometime during the summer
510040	516440	and last but not least we've got esa talking about their plans for e3 2021 with the date being set
516440	523800	already from 15th through the 17th june 20 of 21 and they said it's going to be their reimagined
523800	530760	version of e3 whatever that's supposed to mean so i don't know but it is it is interesting they're
530760	535320	using the word reimagine so that's where they're kind of setting the expectations is that this is
535320	540600	going to be a different show when it comes back in 2021 so the cancellation you know certainly
540600	546200	i i think covid and and the the global crisis we have going on there i think that was going to get
546200	551640	e3 eventually one way or the other but um i think it definitely goes to show that some some of this
551640	557080	other thought about how to reinvent a show um may have come into play with that you know again i
557080	561880	think the pandemic would have claimed the show eventually um but it is you know a lot of people
561880	566600	when they pulled the plug it did seem still kind of early on um so it's just kind of interesting
566600	572440	that they definitely are looking at what is the show going to look like in the future um right
572440	576360	and then i was going to say also to kind of clarify i dig it i did find the information
576360	581320	about the ign event that's supposed to take place in june as well yeah and it's it doesn't
581320	586360	it strike you as very i don't it's it's oddly opportunistic of ign isn't it i mean i'm not
586360	591480	that i'm saying like they're doing anything wrong i mean it's a it's a smart business move but it
591640	598440	is interesting that ign is jumping on that before the esa because wasn't the esa supposed to announce
598440	604440	a digital event or wasn't the esa supposed to be doing their own thing i thought i don't remember
604440	609000	if that's i thought that was a thing or not well they kind of um it was like they said look forward
609000	613000	to this but they never like confirmed it's happening here it's this time it's just kind of
613000	618520	one of those we're figuring it out as we go along type of things right and i guess you know it could
618520	623960	be that they're just trying to get you know more traffic to their i mean obviously they're trying
623960	628520	to get more traffic to their site because they make a lot of money from these collaborations
628520	635000	with different companies for advertising um i mean i'm sure it's just all kind of a lot of um patty
635000	640200	in the back and stuff like that but i don't know we'll see how the coverage is i mean i don't really
641000	645480	it's been so long since i've been to ign i went there today i'm like wow their sites really
645480	652040	changed because it's been like months if not years since i've been to ign well but i mean
652040	657560	even though i say it's a little opportunistic i mean it's smart because you know clearly if they
657560	662360	were able to sign on the dotted line to get all these companies to commit to doing these types of
662360	668840	reveals um at an ign event then clearly the esa had not thought to sign them all already which is
668840	674440	a severe lapse in judgment on their part uh yet another in a string of bad decisions by the esa
674440	679880	sorry but i'm calling it like it is um so ign was able to step in there smartly and get all
679880	685640	those uh people to sign off and now essentially they are taking the hat of being the uh digital
685640	691000	e3 even though they can't call it that but that is essentially what they're doing and now ign can
691000	697720	basically cock block everyone else and you know they have the exclusive video will be you know
697720	701400	going to their site to see all that stuff although we all know that shit will get ripped and put on
701400	706360	youtube and what have you but you know essentially ign is going to make their site the place to go
706360	712280	to see all of that which you know hey digital journalism kind of needs a lot of help and that
712280	717480	stuff right now so again i'm not like shaming or saying it's a bad thing on ign it's it's
717480	721880	fucking smart but it's interesting that they were able to do it is what i'm really saying
724280	729720	so yeah i mean i it's not surprising that they would take the opportunity to do that but
730120	735000	we'll see how the coverage is i really don't care i like my information and i feel that with all
735000	738600	these announcements that things are getting postponed and canceled that we're not going to
738600	744680	hear a lot until at least you know uh gamescom and so i don't know it'd be nice to hear something
744680	749560	during june i mean nintendo wasn't listed as one of the companies participating obviously because
749560	754440	they have their own thing that they're doing so it'll be interesting to see i thought a lot of
754440	759240	these companies were going to be doing kind of that like you know kind of the treehouse life type
759320	766360	of um coverage where they're just going to stream some information or gameplay for a few days um
767240	770520	i don't know well i guess we'll have to wait and see what happens well yeah and it was also
770520	775240	interesting because um you know a lot of folks were saying the e3 and i guess maybe i'm one of
775240	781160	these folks e3 was kind of all digestible online anyway like you know many of us would sit here and
781160	786280	watch the digital press conferences online uh we would be watching the videos as they're released
786280	790360	online it's almost like you know you could get more out of the show sitting here watching it
790360	795640	online than you actually could um at the la convention center which is you know what what
795640	801880	broke me on e3 and why i stopped going was when i had to fight my way to get in to see this uh
801880	806200	demo of a new assassins creed game that was just on youtube later that night you know it was kind
806200	809720	of like well if i can just consume all this stuff online anyway then what am i what am i spending
809720	814520	all the money to come to la for well the parties were always pretty good but you know realistically
814520	818360	i can't spend that kind of money and time just to party you know i can party here at home
819000	826360	so this is you know kind of kind of interesting how this may be pushing e3 to where it was at
826360	832040	anyway so i'm at least encouraged to hear the e3 uh and the esa kind of gets the memo
832680	837880	because sometimes i worry about that and that they are going to reimagine it for 2021 i'm just
837880	842920	so curious what that would look like and to be quite honest i'm not sure i have the answer
842920	848840	um maybe it is somewhere in that hole you know we like to party we like to get together um the
848840	853000	people that i know that still like to go to e3 are like well i like to see all my industry people
853000	858760	it's the one time of year i get to see all those people so maybe e3 turns into something a little
858760	865000	more like twitch con but it's not twitch it's the whole industry kind of thing it's kind of that's
865000	870200	kind of where i see e3 kind of going not just twitch con but everything else gone i don't know
871160	877880	we'll see uh we'll see what develops uh in the coming weeks and months ahead uh june all things
877880	882440	considered is not that far off it's only what about seven eight weeks off i guess it depends
882440	887400	what part of june they're going to be doing so we'll see and then of course you know the the
887400	892600	world situation we're facing is also rapidly developing we don't necessarily know what that's
892600	896520	going to look like in in three or four weeks or even by the time june gets here i mean obviously
896600	901240	our fingers and toes are all crossed that we get on the other side of this you know thing within
901240	905880	the next month but i think you know we're kind of mentally preparing some of us for the fact that it
905880	910600	could go on excuse me a little bit longer uh and the reason why i say that is because you know
910600	914680	we're looking to games com maybe to deliver some of the news a little later in the summer but
915240	919400	maybe there won't be a games com either don't know i mean just because this thing is over
919400	922840	does that mean we can suddenly have conventions with thousands of people again that may not
922840	927000	necessarily be the best idea i don't know i'm gonna leave it to health experts and scientists
927000	933000	and listen to what they have to say on the whole thing so anyhow um let's move on from e3 and talk
933000	937320	a little bit about closer to home how was your gaming week and the types of video games that
937320	941720	you've been playing this week i bet i don't have to guess very much what game dark soccer has been
941720	948840	spending the most of her time on what are you up to i've been playing doom kidding cool that'll be
948840	954840	good somebody finally played doom on the cast great playing animal crossing um and i got dan
954840	964040	playing now too so dan lives on koholint island and uh i just i i visited a friend in australia
964040	969720	right before the show so i have a couple of the southern hemisphere seasonal fish right now and
969720	975640	well just a ribbon eel and a couple of the bugs um but the funniest thing is like when you catch the
976200	983240	red dragonfly it says i didn't even have to roll initiative nice and that one's my favorite um
984120	989960	and then um i started playing pocket camp again once i realized that there's like a code for stuff
989960	994680	that they're gonna keep doing codes like this if you're playing both games so i started playing
994680	1000520	that again um and that's really about i did play a little pokemon go when i had to go to the doctor
1001480	1008120	um and i'm disappointed because um i live just far away enough from the the gym that i can't
1008120	1013560	hit it but i can hit the pokey stop in my neighbor's backyard and what i mean in my
1013560	1019080	neighbor's backyard is it's actually at this uh this uh walking path or bike path that cuts into
1019080	1026200	my neighborhood and there's a sign there and um and sometimes if my gps is being wonky i can hit
1026280	1032120	it from the corner of my backyard um but now i can just sit in my bathroom and hit the pokey stop
1033080	1038280	yeah they also doubled the distance of the gym thing so you can actually hit a gym
1038280	1044280	from twice as far away as you used to be able to um which i know i did finish a gym battle oh nice
1046360	1052360	yeah yeah sadly i'm just out of range of the closest gym to the house now but there's a second
1052360	1057800	gym in the neighborhood i got a new um portal for ingress approved in uh opr or excuse me
1057800	1061480	niantic wayfare and it made a new gym in the neighborhood on my walking so now i have two
1061480	1068280	gyms on my walk path so it's great you should do my mailbox in my neighborhood uh i is it like
1068280	1073640	painted or something special yeah oh okay it's like a well not painted but it's a it's a mailbox
1073640	1078040	it's got mail on it i'll take a look if it's just a generic mailbox those usually don't meet
1078040	1084200	criteria i probably won't go through okay yeah all right so if that's it for your gaming week
1084200	1092360	then we will go to loki all right so i did play a ton of stuff uh this week so one of the things
1092360	1098120	i did is i'm like i said i mentioned i was replacing my laptop because my old one's kind of
1098120	1106760	dying so i got a nicer laptop um that it's got like an rtx 2070 in it and you know 32 gigs of ram and
1106760	1113160	you know a nice i7 processor so i was um loading up vr games so i played a little bit of half-life
1113160	1119720	alex and that's really immersive and fun so i really enjoyed that and then i finally got
1119720	1128600	around to playing beat saber a bit so um not uh it's still you know getting used to that because
1128600	1134440	it's quite hard to play it on normal and stuff so um it was pretty fun and then of course the
1134440	1140520	big thing i did this week was convert over my uh ddr cabinet to run step mania so now i have
1140520	1146040	a set medium machine with like 2 000 songs loaded in there so i did actually play some ddr this week
1146040	1150680	and stuff can you go back to the old way if you want or is that a permanent change um it's not
1150680	1155480	a permanent change this requires you know unhooking some things and plugging stuff back in
1155480	1161560	um so yeah i could go back if i want um so it's definitely not permanent i wanted to get it like
1161560	1167720	so that i could switch between the two but i that would require some more uh hardware and wiring
1167720	1173400	stuff up but it's got everything going i mean uh the lights work and everything i bought a while
1173400	1181080	ago a lighting board for it so that i could uh use set me to control the lights um but it looks nice
1181080	1186520	um i did find out though that the tv that they replaced in there so there's an lcd tv in there
1186520	1192840	um and apparently the remote doesn't work for it so i had to disassemble the front flex or the
1192840	1199400	front like a glass that was on there in order to actually get to the uh the tv to change the
1199400	1204760	settings on it which is kind of funny in order to get it to work with um how i have the computer set
1204760	1209160	up but yeah it's been pretty cool and um i'm just trying to get everything organized right now
1209160	1216440	because it's um there's a lot of songs in there and i need to organize it so i can get it down
1216440	1220440	to a more manageable level because i just kind of dumped everything on there and there's a lot of
1220440	1225880	duplicates and stuff too so uh that's what i've really been working on so can i ask you to expand
1225880	1229400	on half-life alex a little more because you kind of mentioned that one really quick but you know
1229400	1234600	since i i think many of us don't really have vr setups what makes half-life alex kind of like
1234600	1239320	different than a traditional first-person shooter because i guess most people are probably thinking
1239320	1244040	oh it's just a first-person shooter but you're in vr like what like what do they do that makes it
1244040	1251080	like you can't do this on a monitor this is a vr game it's very immersive so like the physics
1251080	1255080	in the game is really good so you can grab pretty much anything interact with pretty much all of
1255080	1261560	the objects in the game um you can use them in very creative ways so for example um and i i
1261560	1266600	don't remember what they're called but there's these creatures that have these giant like
1266600	1272680	tentacle things that hang from the ceiling and so if you get caught by one of them you can
1272680	1278120	basically get eaten so what you're supposed to do is you can throw things at them to have
1278120	1285880	them grab those and they can walk by or you can wear like you can find um you know stuff on the
1285880	1291880	ground to use to help you out as well like so for example there's construction helmets around so you
1291880	1297000	can put a hard hat on um my kids were saying put the button there's a bucket on the ground so
1297000	1301080	they're like put it on your head and yeah again once you put a bucket on your head if you really
1301080	1309000	wanted to um you can grab markers and draw on the windows and stuff um you can you know pick up
1309000	1316040	glass bottles and smash them you can i don't know you can grab like a explosive gas canisters and
1316040	1320520	throw them at something and then fire a gun at it plus then you get gravity gloves later on so you
1320520	1325720	can start grabbing you know things out of the air you can throw stuff up and catch it it's pretty
1325720	1333320	cool um and then it's just very immersive both sound and atmosphere um it's really great it looks
1333320	1340840	like the graphics look incredible like it's just a really great looking game um so i mean i i don't
1340840	1346280	know i got to play for about like an hour or so today and it was just really fun okay cool no
1346280	1350920	thanks i i was kind of curious a little more just because you know especially you know thanks to
1350920	1354600	quarantine like you know i have a couple friends that i probably could go to their place and check
1354600	1359240	it out you know play it but i i can't so i i kind of have to live vicariously through others right
1359240	1363400	now with all this uh quarantine going on but when this is over hopefully i'll get a chance to check
1363400	1368360	it out yeah definitely and then also i um i picked up boneworks as well which is supposed to be
1368360	1373240	another really immersive vr game so i'm going to be uh looking forward to play that as well
1373800	1379000	um and then even had fun with beat saber i like turning it up because you know i'm not too like
1379000	1383880	accurate with the um following the arrows so i like putting on the mode where there are no
1383880	1388120	arrows it just hit it in any direction whatsoever and then you just put it like you know expert
1389080	1394680	and just go crazy and it's that's a lot of fun so be sure to pick up autica too because that's a
1394680	1399640	really good music game as well all right i'll check that yep it's harmonix's uh game and it's
1399640	1404360	kind of like uh imagine if elite beat agents was a vr game it's easy simple simplest way i could put
1404360	1410840	it so all right cool all right well uh let's talk about my gaming week okay so last week i mentioned
1410840	1415720	i was going to check this game out and dark soccer this game is up your alley you really
1415720	1422200	have to check this game out okay this game this game is called demon's tilt with the uh headline
1422200	1428760	or with the subheading occult pinball action and it's basically yeah it's a it's it's basically
1428760	1433960	somebody took like their love of devil's crush and alien crush and like made a new crush table that's
1433960	1439320	basically what this is they made satan crush and that's what this game is basically uh it's okay
1439320	1445400	i'm getting it like right now it's like if heavy metal the movie was a pinball table which maybe
1445400	1451960	it was i don't know but it was i like there is so much going on in the game i couldn't tell you what
1451960	1456440	the fuck is happening but it's really pretty and it's one of the it's it's one of those pinball
1456440	1460200	games just like alien crush or devil crush where there's like you start on the middle table and
1460200	1464040	you can fall to the lower table or you go all the way up to the upper table like it's one of those
1464040	1468200	things there's the multi-levels like what was that like rollerball on the nes or something was like
1468200	1472040	the first game i remember doing something like that but it has those whole like different levels
1472040	1478280	um so i played it on xbox game pass but i believe it is on windows and mac if i'm not mistaken and
1478280	1482920	uh nintendo switch so dark sakura has no shortage yeah it's on steam but i think i'll probably get
1482920	1487800	it on switch that's pretty cool yeah so uh i i feel like this game's up your alley so i would
1487800	1491320	feel horrible if i didn't recommend it to you so i spent a good time some good time playing this game
1491320	1495000	and just watching all the pretty stuff and trying to get achievements and yeah it was pretty cool
1495000	1499560	so uh i look forward to your review next week dark sakura uh because you're the pinball queen
1499560	1503080	uh but i enjoyed it i enjoyed it and that was definitely my review will be i played animal
1503080	1509960	crossing was at some point you're gonna need a break from animal crossing at some point
1509960	1515240	anyway uh so i played that and uh i've been playing the usual stuff too i found sc14 orna
1515240	1520680	diablo uh but i played some other new well okay i play one other new game i play one old game too
1520680	1525080	so because you know i'm stuck at home i've definitely been making use out of my xbox game
1525080	1531400	pass i also played here's a jamie game sort of king of fighters 98 how random is that is on game
1531400	1537560	pass hell yeah so i was like i'm gonna play this why not oh i can put together my dream team of
1537560	1543000	kim kapwan and my and uh andy bogart all in the team and uh yeah there's uh you know it's it's
1543000	1547720	ba it's the neo geo game but it's when they did it for the xbox 360 because it's uh that
1547800	1552280	compatibility version but i thought it was like random and cool that that was on xbox game pass
1552280	1557960	so uh there was that but then the other game that i spent a bit of time playing uh was one of those
1557960	1563080	games where people have been telling me for like years you need to play this game and i don't know
1563080	1567160	why i resisted i guess maybe like watching the early trailers and stuff i was like i don't really
1567160	1572680	know if that's for me or i didn't like i had the first game on 360 and i don't really remember
1572680	1578200	playing a lot of it and now that i've played a good like 90 minutes or so of it i i fear i
1578200	1583400	may have made the same mistake that i made with the mass effect series the first time i played it
1583400	1587240	because and if you don't know what i'm talking about the first time i played mass effect
1587240	1591640	i thought i was like i don't get it but then i went back years later and played it and i was like
1591640	1599320	i am obsessed.com and i played the entire trilogy so what game was it that i finally played this
1599320	1609800	week near automata oh my god it's so fun it's like i i'm like oh it's so good like uh i played
1609800	1615080	through like that whole like intro level the only like frustrating thing was that you can't save in
1615080	1619160	that whole opening like you go through like an hour long opening and you can't freaking save
1619160	1623560	at all that was the only annoying thing but otherwise i i kind of didn't realize it's like
1623560	1627640	okay it's like an actiony kind of game like you're playing something like i don't know like maybe
1627640	1634600	like bayonetta i mean another platinum game i guess um but you're kind of playing a shooter game
1634600	1640360	at the same time it depends what difficulty level you're playing on if you play on bobby blackwolf
1640360	1645560	mode or easy mode then the shooter stuff i think is i i'm playing on normal but i believe i read
1645560	1649640	that on the easy mode the shooter stuff is kind of all done for you so you can just focus on button
1649640	1653640	mashing the um melee combat stuff but i'm playing on normal mode where you kind of have to do both
1653640	1659960	at once and it's it's really confusing at first but it's like really really fun so um yeah it's
1659960	1663880	and they just put it on game pass this past week so that's why i finally jumped in i was like oh
1663880	1669080	i should just play this already um hey rob yeah what if i can interject real quick demons till
1669080	1675240	just 13.99 on switch right now oh that's not bad that's not bad i mean i pay for xbox game pass
1675240	1679640	so it's free but not really free because i'm paying for xbox game pass so it's you know that
1679640	1685000	whole thing but if you have 20 on steam oh oh so it's a little cheaper on switch well that's good
1685000	1691080	cool um so yeah near i i definitely want to go back and play more so i can get further into the
1691080	1695000	game and tell you if there's like even more about it that i like um because now i feel like i kind
1695000	1698840	of hit like i feel like i played through all the prologue stuff and i was doing some of the stuff
1698840	1703080	around the ship and then i kind of like ran out of time um but i want to go back and do more and
1703080	1709400	see if like the later levels are as fun as that first one was um and i think finally like because
1709400	1714440	they have that raid in final fantasy 14 uh it has a really you know it's a really cool ambience and
1714440	1720040	the music in final fantasy 14 is incredible and like i didn't really realize they kind of lifted
1720040	1725720	stuff directly from the game i mean it's a little different but like the game's soundtrack is fucking
1725720	1733480	great like it's oh it's good so yeah uh my bad you all told me for a long time i needed to play it
1733480	1739560	finally got around to it you all were right what can i say finally played it so uh and i will be
1739560	1743640	playing more of it later on so it's near automata finally all these years later so playing the xbox
1743640	1748200	version which i guess is the i don't know if it's the definitive edition but it's like the most
1748200	1754200	recent one they put out so it has like all the extra stuff in it i think so playing that one uh
1754200	1758520	all right so there it is that's my gaming week so um don't really have a lot else to say here at the
1758520	1762760	top of the show i think we ought to just jump right into some gaming news so loki what's going
1762760	1769400	on in the gaming world this week all right so let's talk about rumors and speculation of course
1769400	1779320	um so there is the whole anniversary of mario coming up here pretty soon the 35 year anniversary
1779880	1786360	and the rumor is that nintendo is playing on remastering some of the 3d mario games to put
1786360	1793000	into a collection kind of like a new um mario all-stars type game so the thought is that there's
1793000	1801000	going to be remasters of the mario 64 the galaxy games uh sunshine that type of stuff as long as
1801000	1807480	um as well as there's going to be some information about super nintendo world and of course the
1807480	1816200	upcoming animated super mario movie that's being worked on um as well so apparently the thought
1816200	1821400	that the reveal is supposed to happen around e3 um but now it's gonna be rolled into maybe a
1821400	1827720	different trade show or maybe part of this digital event they're gonna do and usually you know i'm
1827720	1832600	i'm iffy on bringing up rumors here on the program it's obviously not the first time we've done it
1832600	1836920	but this is one of those rumors that's kind of coming from multiple places right like it's it's
1836920	1842040	not just like my uncle who works at nintendo told me this is happening like this is coming from
1842040	1848680	places that are right in historically and it's like several outlets are kind of cross-verifying
1848680	1855320	this information so it's it's a high pro on the plausibility scale it's pretty high right
1856520	1860840	um i think it's pretty reasonable that they would do something like this it seems like easy enough
1860840	1866360	to remaster some of these older games especially since they've kind of have remastered like some
1866360	1875080	of the galaxy games and stuff because they were running them on um the nvidia shield in china oh
1875080	1880200	that's right no you're right they did make those games on on the shield so so technically i mean
1880200	1885480	that's pretty i mean it's shield hardware is pretty similar to the nintendo switch already
1885480	1892120	so the work's been kind of already done um so i mean it's pretty plausible it's gonna happen in
1892120	1896920	more announcements regarding super nintendo world i mean that makes sense since they're already
1896920	1901960	working on it and we already know that the mario movie is coming it would be cool if we had a
1901960	1907160	trailer or something uh but i don't think i don't remember when that slated to come out that might
1907160	1913080	be 2021 or 2022 uh but yeah it'd be interesting to hear something about it i believe the mario
1913080	1917160	movie was supposed to be like holiday 2021 or something like that so you know maybe a trailer
1917160	1921240	or first look would make a lot of sense so we kind of get the idea like what does it look like is it
1921240	1925320	like a cartoon or is it like a and it's probably not it's probably gonna look like despicable me
1925320	1931000	that type of animation yeah oh i don't think i mean well not like you know what i mean like that
1931000	1936040	style of like pixar-ish type of art yeah it's not like the whole thing is gonna look like despicable
1936040	1941960	me but you know it's that same studio so it's that type of art yeah yeah um illumination is
1941960	1948920	like great stuff so i wouldn't be any surprise if it's gonna be great well and the mario uh world
1948920	1955320	was supposed to open in japan in time for the tokyo olympics and i don't know if they had
1955320	1959320	ended up ultimately pushing the opening back a little bit or if it was going to make it but we
1959320	1964200	saw some of those construction pictures out there it would have made a lot of sense that like early
1964200	1971400	june would have been a great time frame to get a first look at the mario park if it was going to
1971400	1977240	open soon for the tokyo olympics obviously the global pandemic has fucked up all of these
1977240	1984840	timelines so nothing is certain anymore but i mean it's it would seem like early june would
1984840	1989560	have been about the right time to hear more about the park and probably those sorts of things were
1989560	1995000	already in motion as far as getting the footage concept putting that stuff together before the
1995000	2000520	pandemic really hit so we could still still see some of that come out in june it just might be
2000520	2004040	the timetable of when this actually opens could really be up in the air
2005880	2011480	i suppose yeah i mean it'd be interesting to see uh i would like some more details of what's going
2011480	2016920	to be at the park because i'm very excited to go see that yeah i remember seeing some of the the
2016920	2022360	video shots that they had showing like those moving platforms and stuff um i mean it's looking
2022360	2026840	very much like their concept that they had in there so i'm very curious to see what kind of
2026840	2030920	rides and everything because i mean honestly once that stuff opens up especially over here in the
2030920	2037320	united states i'm down to go to go vacation there so we'll have to see uh sg100 matt with an
2037320	2041720	excellent point in chat saying theme parks are in big trouble so it's really up in the air yeah i
2041720	2045880	mean we don't know what it's going to look like on the other side of this you know we don't know
2045880	2050280	if theme parks are going to be able to reopen right away and i suppose just a lot of that
2050280	2055880	really depends on the science behind this thing you know can they test to see if people have it
2055880	2061640	really fast you know can they do more things to slow the spread down and so forth i mean a lot of
2061640	2067800	these factors are going to dictate if theme parks can open up really fast or not um because i i mean
2067800	2074120	again i am not a scientist or a doctor but i could see a situation where like small businesses open
2074120	2080760	up again and you can still kind of have small gatherings but they frown on the big stuff for a
2080760	2087880	few more months i mean again i have you that's just me you know being a fortune teller i have
2087880	2092600	no idea to listen to the people that are doctors and scientists and what they have to say but i
2092600	2095880	could just kind of see that that's like a logical progression that this sorts of thing is like
2095880	2100760	easier to track in smaller groups than it would be you know thousands of people at a theme park
2100760	2108360	type of thing so i don't know anyway um yeah and phoenix uh in chat is asking is it going to end
2108360	2113480	up being seasonal is another important question that's a hugely important question and you know
2113480	2119320	can we develop uh you know again the the rapid testing can we develop an immunity can we develop
2119320	2124120	a vaccine like we can do for the flu you know so much is dependent although all those things we
2124120	2129160	don't have an answer for yet but we know the world is working on it um and from a technical angle
2129160	2133880	you know that folding at home that we talked about a few weeks ago has never seen the type of action
2133880	2138840	that has been seen because everybody wants to help do something about all the bitcoin miners
2138840	2145080	are taking their resources and moving them more appropriately to be working on um this instead
2145080	2149160	maybe that's why cooking mama on the switch is it's actually where you know i'm just okay that's
2149160	2152040	that's a whole other thing i wasn't going to bring up because we don't know what the hell's going on
2152040	2155960	cooking mom on the switch but i'm sure you've seen some of the rumors going on out there so yeah
2155960	2161320	anyway but anyway uh so we just don't know there's still a lot of things that are going to find out
2161320	2165960	in the weeks and weeks and weeks ahead so uh we will see uh anyway going back to the
2165960	2170360	mario story for a minute uh what about these mario games that they're saying could be part
2170360	2176920	of the uh remaster i i think the mario sunshine and mario galaxy games really do seem like good
2176920	2181880	candidates to come back because especially mario sunshine i think was really under appreciated the
2181880	2185080	first time when it was out on the gamecube but i feel like it was one of those things like
2185880	2190600	a lot of people that played it still really loved it for its unique kind of water mechanic
2190600	2194760	and then you know bringing back mario 64 is kind of just like that sure thing you know especially
2194760	2199160	if they if they kind of up res it and make it look even better if they're gonna like truly remaster
2199160	2203560	it uh i think that has the potential to do very well because you know that's a lot of people's
2203560	2207400	all-time favorite mario game what do you think about specifically the games that they're choosing
2207400	2214920	loki or dark soccer well i don't think they've really announced yet what games they're gonna
2214920	2220600	choose i mean it's all kind of speculated right now um i don't know i it's been a while since i
2220600	2224440	played galaxy i would love to go back to play those because they were apparently really great
2224440	2229560	games which i had not you know wish i'd actually finished them i hear also that the rumor is
2229560	2234360	supposed to be that they're going to be announcing a new paper mario game and honestly i mean i
2234360	2239000	haven't been able to get into a lot of paper mario games but super paper mario that was on the wii
2239000	2244600	was fantastic and i love that yeah the wii one was really good how about how about super mario
2244600	2249480	rpg how about that although essentially i think that's kind of what paper mario is
2250360	2253880	it's kind of like well we can't make mario rpg anymore because that's the square enix thing but
2253880	2257480	hey anything is possible in this crazy world you never know i'm gonna cross my fingers i'm
2257480	2263720	personally looking for famicom grand prix f1 race i mean just saying it was only out on the
2263720	2269640	disk system and you know hey mario racing another car it isn't you know mario kart you never know
2269640	2275000	dreams really do come true sometimes you never know i'm rooting for mario is missing hell yeah
2275000	2281000	let's bring entertainment back all right anyway uh let's move on and talk about um you know this
2281000	2286280	this news is one of those like it's not surprising although it still kind of sucks but you kind of
2286280	2292680	saw it coming and that is that the last of us part two has been delayed again with no new release
2292680	2297720	date set we don't know when it's coming out it's like gaga's album it's been put on hold until
2297720	2303240	she's ready until we know when this whole thing is going to be behind us and so on so i'm sure
2303240	2308840	that news does disappoint people but i are y'all really surprised so yeah the game was going to be
2308840	2314840	coming out on may 29th but uh they did confirm via a tweet um sie has made the difficult decision to
2314840	2321000	delay the launch of the last of us part two and actually marvel's iron man vr until further notice
2321000	2325720	logistically the global crisis is preventing us from providing the launch experience our players
2325720	2331080	deserve currently there are no other delays to report but we'll keep you updated and i'm sure
2331080	2335880	a lot of people are wondering well why don't they just do a digital release and da da da da
2335880	2342680	and i think the reality is those day one sales are so important that i think they want to make
2342680	2349080	sure they're engaging not just digital but they are engaging the people that want to get retail
2349080	2355640	or physical or the people whose habits are more i want to go to target i want to go to game stop
2355640	2361560	i want to go to wherever it is that i get games um to to buy this game in a physical condition
2361560	2365400	because maybe i live in a part of the country where the internet isn't as strong so i can't
2365400	2370600	exactly download a 70 gigabyte game or whatever this thing chalks in as and so those day one and
2370600	2376200	those launch number figures are so important where it's like whereas sony could do an all digital
2376200	2381560	launch is it in their best business sense to really do that and i think the reality is no
2381560	2387240	it's not and that's why they're putting it on hold until they can really do a strong worldwide launch
2387240	2392040	i mean kind of look what's happening at the final fantasy 7 remake fantasy 7 remake kind of came in
2392040	2396360	like it went gold at a really weird time where it was like okay they've hit the ground running on
2396360	2400680	getting the distribution going and then the pandemic happens because you know these things
2400680	2405960	don't just ship from the factory the night before this is a a couple months long process to get from
2405960	2411160	the gold master of the game to what you see out there and now the final fantasy 7 remake thing is
2411160	2417480	kind of messy i suppose although certainly not square i feel weird saying messy because it's
2417480	2422760	certainly not square enix's fault or sony's fault or anybody's fault it's just well some copies got
2422760	2426760	there early and they don't give a shit anymore because of what's going on some copies are going
2426760	2432040	to be there late and i got my email from amazon saying mine is coming late and although i'm a
2432040	2435800	little bit like ah bummer i'm like you know what though i completely understand getting
2435800	2440600	things out like gloves masks groceries and things that people actually need right now
2440600	2444680	is more important than final fantasy 7 remake and if it i'm really that bent up about it
2444680	2448680	then i guess i could do digital so i'm not like you know that bent out of shape about it but
2449240	2453320	the final fantasy 7 if you were bent out of shape about it you need to evaluate your priorities
2453320	2457720	exactly exactly so i'm like you know whatever you know if i have to wait a couple more days
2457720	2462840	whatever uh it's i'll probably still be on house arrest through the month of april anyway so i'll
2462840	2467400	get a chance to play it uh plenty well in fact actually yes we all know we're going to be here
2467400	2471720	till at least may 3rd for uh it was was that the governor's thing was may 3rd or was that just the
2471720	2476360	bay area and where the bay area goes sacramento quickly follows regardless as a matter we know
2476360	2481560	we're going to be here till may so um you know if it's a couple days late whatever i'll still
2481560	2487880	have plenty of time to play it um i just don't think that sony wants to launch these games
2487880	2493400	and have it be as all over the place they want this to still be a gaming event and maybe
2493400	2500840	something when people aren't focusing on all these other more important things and can go back to oh
2500840	2506360	i'm just doing a game it's a fun silly thing and maybe it also may just be viewed in poor taste
2506360	2510440	right now to be doing a zombie related game i don't know i mean that that could certainly be
2510440	2515000	weighing to it as well i don't i don't think that's a big deal but it could be for some people i don't
2515000	2521720	know so um phoenix in chat says i'm curious about whether the delay is covid related or quality
2521720	2528440	related either way a good idea i really do think it's covid related as as its core and probably
2528440	2534200	because the quality can't really be finished like i don't know about you guys but like i'm working
2534200	2539000	from home right now and i and i'm very fortunate to be able to do that i'm very very fortunate and
2539000	2544600	very thankful that my position is something that can do that but it is a slower process
2544600	2549320	and that's nothing to do with you know i i still am a good little worker bee but it's that you know
2549320	2555080	sometimes the connection to the server is slower uh things working on a laptop is just not as fancy
2555080	2559240	as when i'm working on my dual monitor setup back at the office there's just things about it that
2559240	2563480	are inherently slower and the reason why i say that is that you've got all these sony employees
2563480	2568520	and so forth that are also working from home right now and so probably the quality process
2568520	2573640	is moving slower you know just and even just a little bit can kind of back up the whole system
2573640	2581000	if you know what i mean so there is that to be uh uh put in perspective um and phoenix and chat
2581000	2585160	also says rob what do you think about them charging full price for a quarter of a game
2585160	2589240	um it's not going to be a quarter of a game for i'm assuming that's about fall 97 remake
2589240	2593000	it's not a quarter of a game from what i understand and apparently a new trailer released
2593000	2598760	this week really shows that they are doing some things that should not have been part of the mid
2598760	2606600	gar story so they're clearly and i i've read one thing i hear there's other spoilers i'm trying to
2606600	2611160	keep myself pure on it i will probably get spoiled because people are dicks on twitter
2611160	2617720	but i'm gonna try to go in it as pure as i can um and i know i was super surprised by seeing that
2619880	2626280	i'm glad you uh cut out there all right so anyway yeah um so i i don't think it's really going to be
2626360	2631400	a quarter of the game like it's not and even if you play the demo again i i kind of use that as
2631400	2637720	my there's things in that demo that weren't in the original game so they're they're whatever
2637720	2642920	what i was trying to say as really surprised in that latest trailer that you know erith decided
2642920	2650280	to put on the impenetrable vest that's you know no blade can pierce through so i'm really really
2650280	2655880	curious to see how this is going to change this yes somebody gifted her a bulletproof vest for
2655880	2659240	no particular reason and we'll see how that changes thing i'm a time traveler for the future
2659240	2666040	here take this anyway and don't go to 2020 all right anyway uh so there those games have been
2666040	2671640	delayed so we will hear when they get rescheduled when sony is ready to unveil it i would anticipate
2671640	2677560	don't expect to hear a new date until people are back at work when people are back at work across
2677560	2683640	the country then you'll hear a new date but not before so moving on dark sakura
2686120	2692760	i forgot where i had myself muted so um you know we had talked about amazon's whole gaming deal
2692760	2697640	before and it looks like they've actually released some information about some titles that are going
2697640	2704440	to be coming out their first original big budget stuff coming out in may one of them is a sci-fi
2704440	2710520	third-person shooter called crucible um been in development for a while i mean the description
2710520	2718600	is pretty you know out there you know very vague um you it's survival and control fighting with
2718600	2725800	fellow competitors it doesn't really so it looks like it's a team versus game so you know kind of
2725800	2732840	maybe overwatch-ish from what it sounds like um or like you know fortnite something like that
2733320	2739320	and it's supposed to be uh released in uh in may and then another one in may is an mmo called new
2739320	2747240	world that has been described as a tolkanesque reimagining of 17th century british america
2747800	2756360	um so basically it's you know colonialism and fantasy i guess kind of weird um i don't know
2756360	2762760	that i'm too happy about that as a theme because i mean well we all know how great colonialism
2762760	2770360	worked for native populations so just saying kind of not very well of them to do that as a theme
2770360	2773880	let's see what they let's see where it goes like you know we don't we don't know what the story
2773880	2779240	really looks like yet it better be void of other humans for me to enjoy it yeah well if they're
2779240	2783960	going to bring in like magic and fire and things like that then clearly it's not set in a realistic
2783960	2789560	world anyway so which is probably for the best um well i mean as long as it i don't know i'm
2789560	2794680	uncomfortable with the with the concept of a game that requires overtaking you know an indigenous
2794680	2803400	population but that's me um anyway yeah there there's us oh another uh cloud-based uh gaming
2803400	2811160	service that amazon is developing called project tempo and working um on titles that twitch
2811160	2818200	broadcasters can play with viewers in real time so uh we'll see what that is i guess it's supposed
2818200	2824040	to compete with stadia oh that could be interesting i mean the cloud cloud yeah
2825640	2833000	so who knows all right well we'll we'll see i guess uh amazon will still uh bring uh pull back
2833000	2838120	the curtain on this a little bit uh in the next month uh in may they can stop being shitty with
2838120	2845080	the rest of their practices all right let's move on to uh a game i think we've all confessed that
2845080	2853560	we've been playing recently right logi um correct so pokemon go is making some changes to uh their
2853560	2862840	game to you know kind of address the having to stay at home and quarantined situations so of
2862840	2868280	course you know they've done this in other games like uh minecraft earth had a thing where you can
2868280	2873160	actually bring some of those adventures to yourself now they're going to be doing something similar
2873160	2880120	where you can take on raid battles um from the comfort of your own home with friends so that's
2880120	2886280	pretty cool they'll be able to raid it from home um no word exactly when that's supposed to go into
2886280	2894120	effect 100 but i'd imagine pretty soon so yeah that's got to be a huge change they're making to
2894120	2899000	the back end of it so that's uh it's kind of surprising they're going to go that far with it
2899000	2904760	so it's uh interesting for sure and you know um uh there are other games i i have not played
2904760	2909080	harry potter in quite some time so i couldn't tell you what's going on in that game um but i
2909080	2912600	have still been playing ingress a little bit and it's been interesting to see kind of the changes
2912600	2917880	they've been making there where um they really emphasize recharging which is something you can
2917880	2923640	do from your couch they bumped it up so you get like six times the ap or experience if you will
2923640	2928680	from like recharging that you used to get um so that's kind of interesting and then you're uh
2929000	2934200	streak badge for like there's like a badge for oh you hacked uh portals 60 days in a row or
2934200	2937960	whatever you can get all that from recharging now so it's interesting how they've kind of made that
2937960	2943960	the emphasis um lately but i've still been going out to ingress like once in a great while like
2943960	2950200	last saturday i went to a cemetery because there's a ton of portals there and it's a really easy place
2950200	2954920	to be socially distant from other people uh and just kind of you know messed around in ingress and
2955720	2960040	it's it was a nice little like take my mind off everything else for a little while type of thing
2960040	2966200	so oh yeah and as that brings up they brought a new uh uh double boost item as well that's right
2966200	2970200	i forgot about that they uh that is out as well so you can get some free ones in the shop right now
2970840	2976120	uh phoenix says are all the parks closed up there rob i know they closed them in oregon
2976120	2982840	um like city parks and like parks in the neighborhood no but i think like major one i
2982920	2986920	don't even think they've closed the river parks as far as i know because you know sacramento where
2986920	2991160	we're based is the river city as far as i know they haven't shut that stuff down yet i think
2991160	2995320	they've kind of said we're keeping our eye on it and everybody's been pretty well behaved so far so
2995320	3001080	we're not going to shut it down yet um but i think if you try to go to any state parks and certainly
3001080	3006440	like if i were to go to the coast uh that's closed down and i know they put out an advisory that said
3006440	3011800	don't go to south lake tahoe like the people up there were like don't come here stay home you
3011800	3016520	know so they're those types of more like touristy park things i think they are trying to discourage
3016520	3022680	people from going to so but um i do know even at the parks around here the play structures
3022680	3026920	they've put a bunch of caution tape around or they've like roped it off so that kids can't play
3026920	3033240	on them um because they don't want the surface you know um especially because most kids don't
3033240	3037640	exhibit systems symptoms yes i know there are certainly some very sad exceptions we've heard
3037640	3042680	about in the news most kids don't exhibit systems so they don't want them all over the play
3042680	3046920	structure kind of like spreading it from family to family that way which seems like a smart thing to
3046920	3053560	do so yeah or as that says in chat cootie factories pretty much so yeah i did see that they did
3054200	3059400	surround those because and from what i've seen too even just like going to the park just to kind of
3059400	3063640	walk around or whatever um there's like tons of kids still playing on the parks and stuff
3064360	3068920	so they they they wrap those all up now with caution tape so that it prevents people from
3068920	3074280	doing that yep and they did a similar thing in this neighborhood as well so not surprised
3074280	3079080	yeah well anyhow um just to my next story was kind of about the twitch gaming thing which i
3079080	3082680	didn't realize was going to be part of what dark soccer had already hit on but there's a little
3082680	3087080	extra detail in this to talk about those games that are being um developed for twitch because
3087080	3091480	right now most things as a viewer you're acting a little bit more passively like when somebody's
3091480	3096040	playing marbles on stream you're not really like in there playing the game with them and then
3096040	3099800	i also kind of have heard jackbox party pack using that example but i don't know i feel like
3099800	3103800	a jackbox party pack you kind of are in there playing the game with somebody else i mean maybe
3103800	3108760	the massively ones like you're just in the audience but i would say i know a lot of people
3108760	3115080	that are using jackbox party pack like i feel like that game is doing more business and more success
3115080	3120040	than anything else i know in gaming right now because a lot of like non-gamers are picking it
3120040	3126440	up and doing like zoom parties like my speaking oregon my cousins live up in oregon and um they
3126440	3130600	are doing they were doing a jackbox party pack thing on zoom the other night and i never i was
3130600	3133880	like you guys don't really play video games but that was the thing they were doing to keep in
3133880	3138920	touch with friends so uh that's uh you know obviously been a huge thing anyhow though um
3138920	3143080	amazon did mention in an interview with the new york times that they are developing games
3143080	3148840	that streamers and viewers will play together in real time which is interesting because twitch has
3148840	3153400	always taken a lot of shit about that lag although if you are which i actually don't
3153400	3158200	think is a big deal at all but then again we come from an era of shoutcast where there was
3158200	3165320	always a lag anyway so i'm used to it um but and i believe if you are a um partner you have and i
3165320	3169960	may be wrong and maybe bleeding some things with mixer but i believe you have access to like a very
3169960	3177080	fast uh bandwidth type of thing where the lag is lessened but if there's a new excuse me sorry
3177080	3185960	cough um i believe there's a new um um i lost my train of thought there's a new um technology
3185960	3190520	there yeah and bobby says in chat the lag is now only like three or four seconds oh affiliates get
3190520	3194760	low latency mode as well we actually have it turned on with vog oh i didn't even realize i
3194760	3199400	thought there was still a bit of the delay but even a three or four second delay you can't play
3199400	3204120	games on you can't live like an action game you play jackbox you can't really play like an action
3204120	3209640	game so hopefully uh you know with this cloud gaming and some of these other things that we're
3209640	3213880	hearing about that are you know because google stadia one thing that it does do very impressively
3213880	3218600	and when i've talked about google stadia i've mentioned it it does respond very well it is like
3218600	3223400	you're playing a youtube live so if they're kind of able to have some of that same technology when
3223400	3228120	it comes to playing with other people on twitch that could be very interesting um they are saying
3228120	3232040	games should be available throughout the summer it's not like this will be the first time that
3232040	3237080	twitch has had their own games uh twitch sings was a thing although obviously or is a thing
3237080	3241560	although obviously uh that's a little different because that's not something that viewers
3241560	3246280	play with the streamer all the time and so forth um so yeah they're saying they're going to keep
3246280	3250840	viewers engaged and interested enough to keep coming back and supposedly the thing that twitch
3250840	3256680	wants to have an edge over their competition mixer and youtube and so forth so we'll see where that
3256680	3262280	goes uh very interested to see what kind of games and so forth they come up with on that all right
3262280	3271480	let's move on dark sakura so um i i i'm going to go ahead and preface this story saying that it's
3271480	3277240	focusing a little bit too much on violent games when they're talking about addiction so i'm just
3277240	3283000	going to dive right into it um so there is a study published called computers in human behavior
3283000	3289720	that suggesting that playing violent video games in particular can impair anger detection and it
3289720	3295880	also will enhance a feeling of fighting abilities to make you overconfident in your response to how
3295880	3302360	you would uh think you could perform in a fight basically um and they're they're talking about
3303000	3309800	this bias that violent video games increases aggression and ultra social information processing
3309800	3315240	so they're going from that very flawed standpoint um but they're going a little bit more also into
3315240	3319480	pathological gaming but they're saying specifically that violent video games are leading to
3319480	3325320	pathological gaming which again is pretty flawed in general it's by uh thomas f denson who's a
3325320	3331320	psychology professor at the university of new south wales um where we've seen in other ways
3331320	3335320	that pathological gaming is like with any addiction it can be any kind of video game
3335880	3342200	um you know and it's it's defined as pathological gaming this is a quote occurs when people
3342200	3346920	prioritize playing violent video games he's saying violent i think it's others over facets other
3346920	3351720	facets of life even when doing so causes impairments relationships academic pursuits worker
3351720	3359560	mental health um but they did show a correlation and it's he did specify this as it's not perfectly
3359560	3366520	replicated but the general pattern shows that the violent video games in particular
3366520	3373800	um impair anger recognition and increase the self-perceived fighting ability and it also
3373800	3380280	is supposed he said it also lowers the perception of as and this is a quote again other men's
3380280	3387240	toughness um it was uh three experiments done with 868 participants are randomly assigned to
3387240	3391560	play either violent or non-violent games and then completing various assessments of social
3391560	3397640	cognition and threat perception so the first two they played the game for 15 minutes um on an xbox
3397640	3402760	360 connect i don't know what connect has to do with it because that's not really supported um
3402760	3410280	the third experiment um played internet browser games for five minutes and so with the non-violent
3410280	3417560	versus the violent the um the violent ones tended to be worse at recognizing an angry facial
3417560	3424680	expression and uh were less willing to back out of a hypothetical physical confrontation
3425240	3431880	um and i thought that they'd be able to take take whoever it was in a fight um i again the the the
3431880	3437080	experiment to me just sounds very flawed i went you know i wonder if they did the same thing
3437720	3441400	um you know with say watching a movie or something like that you know
3442040	3447560	again i think that this one went into the the research with a bias um and i'll go ahead and
3447560	3452680	just read this last quote from uh from the the paper this research extends to some other work
3452680	3457880	that we've done on why violent video games are so alluring in that study we found that people who
3457880	3462920	played a lot of violent video games also rated themselves as more of a good catch to members of
3462920	3468760	the opposite sex this is also running the gender binary which pisses me off and they also reported
3468760	3475240	a greater interest in sex um and it also says although those data record uh were correlational
3475240	3479960	they are consistent with our new findings that playing via video games may give people a boost in
3479960	3485960	confidence in both their mating and fighting abilities again flawed yeah well and it's the
3485960	3491240	fact that they used xbox 360 connect for one i can't think of what violent game unless it must
3491240	3496200	be one of those launch titles like the i i don't know there's got to be like some some stuff i'm
3496200	3499960	not thinking of in the moment like early but there wasn't a lot of like violent violent stuff on
3499960	3504600	xbox 360 connect and plus the huge flaw with that is that you're getting your physic if you're
3504600	3507400	playing connects you're getting your physicality up you're getting your heart rate up you're
3507400	3511000	getting your motion going versus an internet browser game where you're sitting there clicking
3511000	3515800	the mouse like that yeah why why aren't they considering the physical the heightened physical
3515800	3521400	senses that's i haven't read the whole study so i mean there could be possibly more in the study
3521400	3529560	but the the fact that this is number one focusing on a a gender binary you know which again is flawed
3529560	3536440	because that's not how people you know really work um there's also you know so many other factors to
3536440	3541880	consider like you were saying even just the physicality of using a connect game where what
3541880	3548120	happens if they're playing like a cutesy fighting game you know or say that they're watching a a
3548120	3553560	violent film or a scary film or say that they have them play a survival horror game you know
3554440	3559960	where where's the difference in there you know again flawed if we're gonna have this type of
3559960	3565400	research going then gamers with psychology degrees need to be on the freaking panel
3566120	3569880	or the fact that they're just being forced to play connect game might make them pretty angry
3570520	3575400	no that ain't me angry well no not if i was playing um dan central i'd be happy with that
3575400	3580600	because i missed that game but that game wasn't violent last i remembered maybe there maybe
3580600	3584280	there's a secret version i don't know about but yeah it's just someone's just really bad at it
3584280	3589800	i think i think you kind of hit your this sounds like it was a loaded thing and that's why you know
3589800	3594600	and again you know in full disclosure we're all saying we haven't really read it the finer details
3594600	3599640	but in reading this summary i think none of us want to because it just sounds like you you
3600360	3604520	really kind of misfired on a lot of different components of this like you go back to the
3604520	3609640	drawing board and start over number one you know get get some gamer experts on the panel get people
3609640	3614840	that you know no thing or two about games number two uh xbox 360 connect is not even a modern thing
3614840	3621160	anymore so modernize it up a little bit do some comparing with other forms of art i think you
3621160	3625160	made a good point when you said cutesy fighting games because you highlighted one it's the classic
3625160	3631400	game of the week well it wasn't a it was kind of a weird you know what i mean but it wasn't it wasn't
3631400	3635720	violent really you know all things are said and done you know there's some different controls here
3635720	3641320	that they're not even looking at that i think really kind of just like no this was ran to get
3641320	3648760	a certain result i don't know anyway um so bobby says fighter within fighter within is a oh god i do
3648760	3653000	remember that fighter within is a connect only fighting game that brings us motion fighting
3653000	3656760	where you'll be flailing your arms legs and doing other silly moves and hopes not only to beat up
3656760	3660520	your opponent but that the game will register what you're trying to accomplish by waving said
3660520	3668280	lips about so what about um they used a fighting game nobody's played crap now i can't think of the
3668280	3675640	of the name uh uh eternal champions with an activator well obviously well okay but just
3675640	3681000	looking at an activator makes me violent i'm just saying all right anyway so i think the study has
3681000	3685160	some problems an adventurous game as well too i don't know why they just didn't do that one that's
3685160	3689320	like a better option i know just play mortal combat 11 for god's sake if you want to test a
3689320	3694200	violent game use one of the most violent ones of all but you know it's it's more modern and it's
3694200	3700120	not you get you can sit there with a controller you're not getting your body and your heart rate
3700120	3705400	up and all that as well like i that that is the most flawed thing like and i'm no scientist or
3705400	3710760	it but i'm like even an idiot can tell you in one scenario you're also you're not really comparing
3710760	3716520	just this to this because the heart rate's going up the physicalness is going up it's it all this
3716520	3721400	other stuff is is is heightened and so you're not really like it's not you're supposed to have a
3721400	3725480	control because the control isolates the one thing you're trying to review and that's not
3725480	3731400	what's happening here at all so anyway just my thoughts on it anyway um let's move on
3731400	3735080	and talk about oh something else that might make you want to fight i don't know loki
3738440	3749560	all right well um yes so unfortunately we got news from um gearbox about some gearbox employees
3749560	3756040	about some um royalty checks that weren't going to be as high as they'd expected so
3756760	3762360	what i've been typical of gearbox employees is that they aren't paid as high as some of the
3762360	3769160	industry um employees in that same position but the way they offset it is they're paid i guess
3769160	3776520	a 60 40 royalty split between the company and the employees themselves so they get 40 percent of
3776520	3782200	that um what has happened or at least been revealed is that because of the fact the
3782200	3789080	development costs on borderline 3 despite the game being incredibly successful were high because you
3789080	3796440	know the game took long to develop and also the conversion from unreal 3 to unreal 4 it cost 95
3796440	3803640	million to develop the game and apparently over 100 million to develop the dlc for that and because
3803640	3807720	of that the resulting checks that they were supposed to receive which these are supposed
3807720	3813720	to be much higher than they were previously um aren't the case anymore so it seems that
3813720	3821160	with this happening they're still being underpaid in general across the board now i'm not sure that's
3821160	3826200	going to increase as time goes on i'm not sure the frequency is of these royalty checks but it
3826200	3831240	still sucks that they're in that position in the first place especially with um coming out of the
3831240	3842040	lawsuit that um they have as well for uh gearbox and everything with randy pitchford it was revealed
3842040	3848440	that he took a 12 million dollar bonus in 2016 um granted that would have been from the 60 percent
3848440	3853800	that the company gets not the 40 percent but in fact that he takes 12 million dollar bonus
3853800	3859960	when they're getting undercut kind of sucks hold up hold up that guy loki that guy point i'm
3859960	3865560	pointing at the poster in the studio that guy yes yes the guy that signed that poster maybe i'm just
3865560	3868360	gonna take that i think i'm gonna take this down for a little while i'm just gonna take it down
3868360	3874360	for a little while all right so anyways yeah so apparently yeah he took his bonus and of course
3874360	3880600	they're all getting underpaid um and then he had some kind words to tell his uh developers if they
3880600	3885240	were unhappy with it basically saying that hey if you're not happy with the royalty system you're
3885240	3895320	welcome to quit so um yeah that's unfortunate but um apparently they've been gearbox has been
3895320	3900200	looking to go public at some point so it'd be interesting to see how that plays in the things
3900200	3906360	but um it's not a good look and especially with a lot of controversy surrounding randy uh pitchford
3906360	3911240	even before the game came out uh it's just it's not not a good look for them no it's not a good
3911240	3914680	look when you're taking 12 million dollars and then telling everybody else to go without that's
3914760	3921080	that's really really not a good look so uh i think we're gonna retire randy from the studio
3921080	3924200	for a little while i think that would be the i think that would be the best idea uh esta
3924200	3928440	200 mountain chat says shame on gearbox for this then again they did promise these six figure
3928440	3933560	royalties in writing when they signed on if so then they have a case well and it's just it's
3933560	3938520	just tacky when the person at the top is getting the most money and the people on the bottom are
3938520	3944280	getting no i mean it would be one thing if it was like i'm taking the pay cut too or i am taking
3944360	3949400	some of this money as as you've seen some like like guy fieri with all the shit this he's taken
3949400	3953240	over the years hey at least he's kind of like taking some of his own money and trying to like
3953240	3957000	put that back into the frontline restaurant workers and all that stuff like it would be
3957000	3961080	a little bit of a different story if something like that was going on but unfortunately it does
3961080	3967400	not appear to be so anyhow all right well thank you for sharing with that us with uh thank you
3967400	3972920	for sharing that with us nonetheless um maybe do you think it would have made more if they hadn't
3972920	3978200	done that whole exclusive to epic thing like where where's the payola from that going i think
3978200	3983240	it's fine i mean because if anything that would have probably been less because i think they got
3983240	3991320	some sort of discounts for using a reel on their own platform um i just think that it you know it's
3991320	3995320	the cost of making the game but i still think they should take care of their employees as well
3995800	4000680	uh it just unfortunately they've had a lot of flops lately with you know both aliens,
4000680	4007080	clone and lorraine's and uh their looters i can't remember the other game that they had
4007080	4013080	so they had battleborn was their other their hero shooter that didn't really take off um
4014280	4021160	i just think yeah it kind of sucks that this is what happened but i'm hoping that maybe
4021720	4028680	with future success you know with the game that maybe they'll get paid better but i guess you know
4028680	4035560	you're in that position now where um you know maybe if opportunities arise you know in the
4035560	4040600	future or maybe they don't stay at the company very long but unfortunately i think a lot of
4040600	4045960	times in this industry that they don't really have the luxury of being able to choose going
4045960	4050360	choose to go to other companies because it seems like everybody is treating their employees poorly
4050360	4055960	in one way or the other well and right now things are kind of stuck you know like now is not the
4055960	4059160	time i think a lot of people want you know with everything that's going on in the world it's not
4059160	4063880	a great time i'm not saying you can't or you know so forth and um you know certainly in other
4063880	4066600	industry i'm talking about specifically about like gaming and tech types of things i think most
4066600	4069320	people are trying to like stay where they're at type of thing i don't think there's a lot of moving
4069320	4076040	and shaking going on in that regard so i mean yeah but after that who knows and i think there
4076040	4079560	are a lot of tech companies people are really happy to work for like i have some friends in
4079560	4084360	the industry and i i don't want to name it because i don't have permission to even though it's a good
4084360	4087640	thing it's just a tacky thing to do because i want my friends to be able to trust that i can
4087640	4092600	separate personal life from the show um but i have friends that work in gaming that absolutely love
4092600	4098600	where they're at and love their companies um and you know uh wouldn't think to you know but but i
4098600	4102840	i'm not hearing these types of stories about those companies either you know what i mean
4104360	4109720	true that that's awesome yeah definitely true and and i think you know different with even
4110680	4115320	leading up to the release of warlands 3 it was just always about randy pitchford doing weird
4115320	4121160	things whether it's leaving a jump drive in a strip club or something like it was like a jump
4121160	4130040	drive with like pornography on it and company you know personal company information it's just or you
4130040	4136200	know punching you know his what was it like getting into a fight with one of his colleagues or
4137000	4143320	just getting into a lawsuit it's just ridiculous all the stuff before the game came out all right
4143320	4147800	well let's move on and try to get to um some more hopeful news here before we get to the
4147800	4153240	classic game or pinball game of the month uh and that is a story about another humble bundle that's
4153240	4157320	out and i know you know humble bundle kind of became its own store so i think the news
4157320	4161400	the notoriety about different like charity bundles and humble bundles i think we haven't heard as much
4161480	4167480	of that uh in like uh the at the top of gaming like remember when these guys first started like
4167480	4173080	every bundle they did um would be a notable thing and that kind of died off a little bit when humble
4173080	4177080	kind of started you know becoming their own store in their own company and so forth but this one
4177080	4181720	is a pretty big one that's getting news headlines again and i think you'll understand why
4181720	4188200	it's the covet 19 humble bundle and it's it's a really pretty impressive bundle that they put
4188200	4193080	together there uh they're saying it is a thousand dollars worth of games and comics that they are
4193080	4199080	putting together for just thirty dollars or more but the 30 is the minimum to get everything
4199080	4203720	but if you want to contribute more you certainly can and all of the money is going to different
4203720	4210840	coronavirus outbreak organizations um and again you can kind of um mix and match how what charities
4210840	4216360	you want to support out of the four uh and so forth which um oh i don't have the names of the
4216360	4220520	charities right in front of me uh i'm loading that up right now let me mention some of the
4220520	4226680	games though that are in the bundle into the breach the witness super hot broken age undertale
4226680	4233320	psycho not psych psychonauts excuse me um and uh yeah so there's there's a lot of you know and
4233320	4238440	again these are indie titles that were probably big in the last like three four years but still
4238440	4243400	i mean this is a great collection of things you might have missed and it's pretty hard to say like
4243400	4247480	oh these games should have been better when it's going for a good cause because it's really about
4247480	4253000	the cause it's not about um you know all the games that you're getting so the charities are direct
4253000	4259240	relief international rescue committee doctors without borders and partners in health so um
4259240	4265000	i just when i donated i just split my money evenly between them all but some people might um you know
4265000	4269240	kind of mix and match a little bit um another one that's very interesting uh that's in there
4269480	4274040	music maker edm edition because that was uh another like utility file that i picked up and
4274040	4277800	i was interested in that one so and some of them are run it starting to run a little low if you
4277800	4284840	want zombotron uh they're down to less than 25 000 keys on that so um something to consider there
4285720	4290440	anyhow at least it's for a good cause and it's nice to see the gaming world come together
4290440	4296040	and uh sell their old games again for good causes so yeah i picked it up as well i just want to make
4296040	4301400	sure i didn't most of the keys i did have quite a few there's a lot of games that i own that i
4301400	4308360	didn't realize i was like oh yeah it's like you already have this i'm like i do yeah i had a few
4308360	4313960	of them like a win uh pac-man championship edition 2 is in there i was like oh uh i love i i already
4313960	4317400	have that game on switch and everything so i'm like oh i'll get that on sale and i was like oh
4317400	4322040	i guess i already had this on steam and i forgot but i still i bought it anyway just because i want
4322040	4326200	to support the cause you know and uh i i think uh there's there's enough stuff in there that'll
4326200	4330040	keep me busy uh the music maker thing too was kind of new for me so i was like oh i'll check
4330040	4334680	that out i want to i want to look at that so yeah really fun yeah for sure all right well let's take
4334680	4339640	a trip back down memory lane we're going to revisit some simpler times uh and dark soccer
4339640	4343560	likes to step into the gaming vault every week and pick a game that she thinks hey you guys should
4343560	4348760	check this out but in a yearly an annual twist once a month she does something a little different
4348760	4354040	and this time uh in the year 2020 she's highlighting classic pinball tables of i think
4354040	4360920	the late 80s and early 90s so uh dark and dark sakura what did you pick for the classic pinball
4360920	4367080	table of the month another one that i own um i picked black rose which is another of my favorite
4367800	4373480	awesome so black sorry the twitch uh twitch video coming in a moment here sorry guys i made a boo boo
4373480	4378600	on my end okay sorry go ahead and talk though we'll get the video up here shortly all right
4378680	4388440	well um black rose is a lady pirate themed game um it was designed by john trudeau and uh brian eddie
4388440	4397160	and it was produced by uh midway as bally and so um its slogan is this game is loaded and so uh
4397400	4408920	you use uh you know uh basically you're doing a pirate fight um so uh it uh actually had um
4411080	4416840	for uh the uk release there was supposed to be some x-rated artwork for the back glass
4417480	4422200	um but it was never produced and they also considered using black pinballs
4422200	4430840	as cannonballs but they abandoned that idea um so the game uh was manufactured in july of 1992
4430840	4439080	as i said by uh midway uh as a subsidiary of williams uh under bally um it uh it was using
4439080	4451000	the williams wpc electronics 2 um and uh there were 3746 units confirmed sold um and so as far
4451000	4457480	as its features it has three flippers three pop bumpers three ramps uh three bank stand-up targets
4457480	4464280	uh two or three multi-ball the left ramp is mechanically raised or lowered with a ramp um
4464280	4470120	to use the ball cannon lower playfield has below the playfield ball cannon a catapult type that
4470120	4476120	oscillates when it's load so basically what this is is that you have this one ramp in the center
4476120	4483080	and it moves side to side and you have to line it up where uh you want to basically shoot the
4483080	4490440	cannonball um and so you fire when you press the fire button on this lockdown bar um it has the
4491400	4497800	the broadside so it will kick the ball to the center of this rail um so we'll set it back to
4497800	4504520	the flippers that way um the art for the table was done by pat uh pat mcman who has done i mean quite
4504520	4511960	a decent bit of uh of various pinball art you know uh he did things like uh trying to think
4511960	4518680	of what people are seeing roller games um he did tales of the arabian knights uh he did baby pac-man
4520120	4527400	dirty harry dungeon dragons fish tales so he's done some big titles mr and mrs pac-man pinball
4527400	4532920	i'm gonna have to find that one day um i was just looking at other artwork that he did but now um
4533000	4538280	one of the things that i'm going to bring into this is a little bit of some crazy notoriety
4538280	4546280	about one of the designers john trudeau um basically he got busted for child porn
4548520	4555240	that's a yike yeah now let me tell you what else he designed that rob the machine bride of pinbot
4556040	4563320	creature from the black lagoon uh judge dread i actually we actually owned judge dread and
4563320	4569800	creature from the black lagoon he did congo um and he had started working for stern in uh 19
4569800	4575560	sorry in 2013 and he had some tables all set up but yeah he was arrested and charged for
4575560	4579720	a possession of child pornography he might have done some cool stuff but what an asshole
4580680	4588680	now here's a little bit more about it is that he actually was um uh that he did plead guilty
4588680	4596360	to those and they had also gotten him on um abuse of a criminal sexual abuse of a female family member
4597480	4606840	um so yeah garbage absolute garbage um so you know i want to point out there that um
4607640	4612920	the uh you know we can have fun with with our tables we can enjoy our fandom but we need to
4612920	4620760	also be aware that you know if you're gonna say oh i love this designer know about the people
4620760	4626120	your favorites are problematic so yeah he's done some great tables i mean creature is dan's favorite
4626120	4632600	um but again you know be aware of the people who uh be aware of the entertainment you consume
4637400	4642280	hello for sure no yes you're still good sorry i'm i'm working on some other projects while
4642280	4648200	you're talking i'm multitasking um back though to a little bit more information about black rose
4648200	4656600	um it was included as a license table for pinball arcade and um goodness i accidentally turned on the
4656600	4665160	stream when i didn't mean to there we go all right so sorry about that um it also was included in
4665160	4671800	williams pinball volume two for pinball fx3 um and included in williams pinball classics in 2001
4671800	4678920	that came out for pc so there you go now i will tell you this is seriously still one of my
4678920	4686200	favorite tables ever um it uh it you might you know if you go to like a trade show or something
4686200	4695000	and you see it out there um it is it's one that people tend to pass up because it seems kind of
4695880	4702120	generic blah blah blah whatever you know but it really is super fun that center cannonball ramp
4702120	4706680	is it probably just makes most of the fun in the game for me and you know you have like these
4706680	4717720	light up targets that say uh sink ship um so it really is just a lot of fun um and i mean as
4717720	4722360	people can see from the video up here it's fairly unique little table it's got enough in there i
4722360	4729160	think it'll keep bringing people back to playing it so um definitely wanna um make sure that all
4729160	4733720	of you out there give this table a shot because it's really a lot of fun don't pass it up if you
4733720	4739480	find one to play all right there it is your classic pinball table of the month black rose
4741080	4746040	and this is our maties yeah that's a fun table and you and it's in your collection at your house
4746040	4754200	right it is it is in right in between my world cup soccer and my doctor who all right very cool
4754840	4759800	all right um so dark soccer i believe my you're working from home again tomorrow so you have to
4759800	4763880	leave us a little soon tonight um so do you want to get into your rapid fire stories here real
4763880	4771640	quick before we uh say goodbye sure um forever entertainment um uh has said that the revenue
4771640	4778840	from panzer dragoon remake has exceeded the production costs so um by more than double so
4778840	4786440	yeah they made the money back good for them hooray and um in other news um a first person resident
4786440	4793720	evil 8 is in the works and should be out by next year at least that seems to be some speculation
4793720	4801080	they're thinking it might be switched but again i don't know i don't i they kind of lost me so
4802120	4806440	i only care about the early ones yeah i but i don't know if i want to see him remake resident
4806440	4811400	evil 4 because i heard resident evil 3 like they really kind of they they kind of changed it quite
4811400	4816680	a bit like they they didn't really stick to it well the big thing on there is with jill's design
4816680	4822680	i was reading is that they tried to make her like take out the sex appeal as much because honestly
4822680	4826840	who's gonna run around fighting zombies in a fucking mini skirt and tube pop yeah it's like
4826840	4832520	running away from dinosaurs in high heels yeah yeah so um but the thing is that you know and
4832520	4837240	this is actually the quote is that they didn't want her to be in something that would be
4837240	4842840	uncomfortable for her task um and i think that's great and it kind of makes me consider that maybe
4842840	4847640	this will be the next cosplay that i revisit because one of my very early ones uh for my
4847640	4856360	first anime expo actually was um jill valentine old school jill all right there you go looking
4856440	4859720	forward to seeing it all right well um dark sakura i know you're heading out but do you
4859720	4864840	have any last words for us before you uh make your way out tonight pray for me 5 a.m shift
4866600	4871720	hey i'm happy to hear you get to go back that's the most important thing so well the big thing
4871720	4876920	is going to be can i actually get back because apparently i can't get into any of my work sites
4878440	4882760	so we'll see if that happens right all right fingers crossed good luck all right fingers
4882760	4887880	and toes bye y'all all right bye thanks for joining us find words to you all right take care
4887880	4892360	great to hear from you tonight all right all right um let's move on with some other rapid
4892360	4899240	fire news uh loki you want to take your your stuff sure okay so i was unaware that they
4899240	4908680	were still even making um updates to this game but apparently rock smith uh 2014 remastered
4909240	4915560	has um ubisoft san francisco has basically said that they're done adding dlc to rock smith so
4915560	4923800	right now they have a library of 1570 songs and yeah apparently they're working on a new project
4923800	4931080	now um it's interesting that's been going on this long i like i said i was completely aware that
4931080	4936760	they were still supporting that game so yeah i knew they were supporting it a while i didn't
4936760	4941320	realize it was like still going on even in 2020 i thought the last time i really saw the dlc was
4941320	4947480	last year but that's still very impressive and it was remastered so i was not aware of that either
4947480	4953560	so yeah neat um yeah so that's unfortunate but i guess we'll have to see what's coming from
4953560	4959480	ubisoft san francisco and then of course this time of the month since we're being a brand new
4959480	4964600	month and everybody is at home it's time to figure out what are the brand new free games that you can
4964600	4970040	get from your subscription services so we have playstation plus which is going to be gracing us
4970040	4977640	with uncharted 4 and dirt rally 2.0 so those are going to be available very soon april 7th through
4977640	4986520	may 4th on the xbox side of the house we've got project cars 2 and nights of pen and paper
4987400	4992920	and then of course on the xbox 360 side we have fable anniversary and toy box turbos
4994840	5001240	all right i didn't i i had forgot they even made a fable anniversary edition but i want to probably
5001240	5007080	check that out i like those games they're fun yep all right uh moving on over to some other news uh
5007080	5012200	this one's about saints row the third uh i don't know what do you think about this loki apparently
5012200	5018200	a remaster could be coming the esrb had a listing for saints row the third remastered uh do out on
5018200	5023160	pc playstation 4 and xbox one you might remember originally these games are on pc playstation 3
5023160	5029400	and xbox 360 um but it's um i guess there was a nintendo switch port as well but it wasn't
5029400	5034280	very good uh that just came out last year but potentially these games could be remade and coming
5034280	5040040	out again on playstation 4 and xbox one although i would think why not start for playstation 5 and
5040040	5043480	the other one but maybe i don't know maybe it's not going to be that big of a remaster i don't
5043480	5050040	know what do you think um i thought that they i mean i guess i guess it was saints row 4 that
5050040	5055240	they had remastered um i mean i i guess it wouldn't be that much of a stretch since um
5056280	5061640	four wasn't that much of a stretch from three so i mean it's practically the same engine
5063000	5069400	so i wouldn't see how that would be a hard thing for them to um port in there yeah it's just kind
5069400	5074280	of killing time i guess until we get a new announcement for saints row oddly enough though
5074280	5080520	because i did end up buying the humble bundle the covet 19 one it did have agents of mayhem in there
5081320	5086280	i saw that it was probably never gonna buy that game but now you got it at least for a good time
5087080	5092840	yeah all right uh also in a quick rapid fire story our last one tonight uh cellar door games in a
5092840	5097560	tweet mentioned that they are working on rogue legacy 2 that's right they're confirming that
5097560	5102120	rogue legacy 2 is in development and they'll be releasing more info later this week in the coming
5102120	5107080	days and there's some screenshots there on their twitter account over at cellar door games and i
5107080	5114120	do want to thank all the folks on um our uh twitter uh and i'm sorry on our discord server for sending
5114120	5120040	us all these stories over on twitter and those sorts of things uh for inclusion this week yes
5120040	5125000	a lot of the things you guys posted in our discord over at vog network dot com slash discord uh we've
5125000	5131080	included on tonight's show so thank you very much for that all right let's move on and travel around
5131080	5137160	the world and check out some release dates and we're going to start in the us loki all right not
5137160	5143560	a whole lot this week so we've got of course disaster report for summer memories on pc
5143560	5149480	nintendo switch and playstation 4 and then of course final fantasy 7 remake is going to be
5149480	5154520	coming out on playstation 4 and that's it yeah and i imagine with everything else going on in
5154520	5160200	the world some of these uh things are you know in influx in limbo and all that good stuff so uh
5160200	5164120	trying to pull up the japanese release dates it's being very slow but i'm pretty sure that
5164120	5170280	final fantasy 7 remake is also a thing uh but on the nintendo switch you can look forward to
5170840	5178440	um let's see a uh i guess there's a whole bunch of animal crossing um like accessories that are
5178440	5183960	out this week but i don't see any actual new games on the switch this week probably because over on
5183960	5190440	the playstation 4 the final fantasy 7 remake is out and final fantasy 7 game or fun fantasy games
5190440	5195560	including 7 tend to do very well in japan uh the only other thing i see uh that is coming out in
5195560	5201240	japan this week is a tom clancy rainbow 6 siege deluxe edition uh that is getting a japanese
5201240	5206360	localized release this week otherwise enjoy that final fantasy 7 remake hell you can even get a
5206360	5212760	playstation 4 or a playstation 4 pro that's a special final fantasy 7 bundle so check that out
5212760	5218280	but that is your big release in japan this week how about europe not a lot coming out in europe
5218280	5226520	as well so we've got cooking mama cook star on nintendo switch and final fantasy 7 remake oddly
5226520	5231720	enough based on the release dates i have here unless that changes this is all we're getting
5231720	5237320	for the next few weeks uh with everything that's going on in the world i'm not completely surprised
5237320	5242920	to hear that to be honest so um it is what it is you notice we're hearing other things get shift
5242920	5247800	back and moved around and i think some of these retail sites that we use to get this information
5247800	5254280	are probably changing because the retail end of things is uh kind of closing down and changing so
5254280	5259640	yeah anyway uh i need to pull up the mailbag here you know what maybe we'll do things a little bit
5259640	5263240	out of order uh loki do you want to read the next story here while i pull up the mailbag
5264040	5270120	sure so this is kind of a continuation like we had last week where we're talking a little bit
5270120	5275320	about gamestop and there is a little bit we could talk about game as well but um talking a little
5275320	5281400	bit more about game exchange so you may remember game exchange is kind of an independent retailer
5281400	5288040	that is similar to a gamestop in certain regions of the united states well um last week we had
5288440	5294040	employees kind of speaking out saying that you know there's issues with you know the sort of
5294040	5299080	thinking that it could be deemed essential considering that gamestop is they're saying
5299080	5307240	they're essential so apparently though now instead of actually uh providing them with you know
5307240	5314360	instructions to close their stores they've been providing them with tips to keep safe instead so
5314360	5320040	like take a sip of warm water every 12 or 20 minutes this keeps your mouth moist and washes
5320040	5325080	away any viruses that enter your mouth into your stomach where your gastric juices will neutralize
5325080	5330360	it these are no these are like fucking bullshit facebook chain posts that like really bored
5330920	5337320	karens are spreading around that are quite harmful actually yes so basically a bunch of these types
5337320	5346920	of uh things you know try avoiding cold it's just doesn't make any sense um so yeah so they've been
5346920	5353960	given this kind of information via an email that was sent to staff on tuesday um and apparently
5354680	5361400	this is from their vice president of retail operations Mindy Kent it's just it's ridiculous
5361400	5366840	and they really need to close these stores down but based on what i'm hearing and there was
5366920	5371080	another video that came out this week about you know some of the gamestop stuff and of course
5371640	5377560	a lot of that is still like rumor until we get from like other sources but um basically saying
5377560	5384360	that gamestop legal is trying to find a way to find a loophole where they can stay as um
5384360	5389080	as trying to deem themselves essential and reopen their stores or they have reopened their stores
5389080	5394520	and are basically fighting the situation and i've read that there's several states that have
5394520	5398520	actually cracked down on them to the point where they've just sent in police to shut them down
5403000	5405960	yeah and i think it's logical we just flow into the next story here before you get to
5405960	5409960	the mailbag and talk about the game stops in massachusetts so all the game stops in
5409960	5414120	massachusetts have closed and uh it doesn't sound like it was something they really wanted to do
5414120	5419480	but here's what happened the inspection services department for the city of boston went to the
5419480	5425080	dorchester store and basically ordered them to close they didn't get a fine but they got issued
5425080	5431320	a nuisance order so yes gamestop got declared a public nuisance this week for their antics at
5431320	5437560	least in boston they did um so they actually followed up went back on wednesday to make sure
5437560	5442200	that it was closed and gamestop confirmed to a report in the boston globe they did close all
5442200	5448680	massachusetts stores on thursday um don't know if gamestop is shut down in any other states
5448680	5453160	although california where we're at they did all close they had to follow the governor's order
5455160	5460040	yeah remember i i said that there might be a possibility of getting posters well i don't
5460040	5463960	think that's going to happen they've already taken signage of the store that's closing nearby here
5463960	5468040	and i mean it makes sense i don't even know when they would be reopening in the first place
5468040	5474040	yeah so oh well yeah it's it's a bummer we lost out on that but completely understandable due to
5474040	5478280	everything else that's going on in the world for sure yeah so all right i think we can now uh take
5478280	5482440	a trip back up to the mailbag and i can read some of these emails that came in uh because we
5482440	5485800	actually got some emails this week thank you very much and if you want to send some emails
5485800	5490920	participate at orange lounge trader.com is the place to send those emails so let's go to our
5490920	5496600	first email tonight from sia tabiri who says hello everyone i often mean to write in but because i'm
5496600	5500200	usually in the chat room i tend to neglect the whole email thing well that's okay we love that
5500200	5504840	you're participating one way or another i know that licensed games are generally not accepted
5504840	5511080	well but are there any non-video game properties you would like to see adapted into a game if so
5511080	5515720	what genre would best fit it and what specific mechanics would you like to see in that game
5517000	5521480	the easiest thing that comes to mind for me is i want to see more game shows adapted like one
5521480	5527000	versus 100 on xbox 360. i think that's like my easy go-to answer because that was a real crime
5527000	5531880	what happened with that whole thing and that it's not around anymore so that's like my easy
5531880	5535880	go-to answer but let me continue on with sia tabiri's email and then i'll get loki's answer
5536440	5543160	personally i would love to see a telltale games type enhanced visual novel a la wolf among us
5543160	5548040	for the tv series version of the magicians or perhaps something more along the lines of
5548040	5552840	psychonauts where you delve into different magicians power sets to tell a more original
5552840	5557480	story within the universe i hope you're all doing well and that this question wasn't as dumb as i'm
5557480	5563480	starting to feel like it was take care no it's not a dumb question uh what type of uh license
5563480	5568600	i open this up to chad as well what do you guys think what's like a um like a licensed property
5568600	5576600	you want to see put into a game loki any thoughts yeah so a licensed property i'd love to see
5577480	5586680	would be a um a vr version of nailed it it's my head my my brain was going to nailed it as well
5586760	5591560	so i was thinking of a cooking mama crossover somehow except one that isn't farming for bitcoin
5592440	5597000	or or if we want to like really get rid of this aside from just vr let's just have the folks from
5597000	5605160	uh that created uh surgeon simulator to do nailed it just have a really crappy like control thing
5605160	5609960	where you have to move the hands and stuff i just want the commentary from nicole buyer because i
5609960	5614600	fucking love her speaking of nailed it by the way if i don't mention this tweet at some point during
5614600	5618920	the show i'm gonna get a nasty gram from shane because he tweeted me earlier this week apparently
5618920	5626440	in the first episode of the new season of nailed it they use music from mass effect and like it's
5626440	5630360	it's like it's music that was made for mass effect and it's on the mass effect soundtrack it's the
5630360	5635400	synthesis ending music of all things is in nailed it he even sent me the clip on my on my twitter
5635400	5641240	account uh and it's it's so it's just funny that you're seeing these uh video game things get used
5641240	5646360	in other places how do they even find that music to use i don't know it's just like a there's weird
5646360	5653080	probably some nerd on staff that decided that hey i'm gonna sneak this in there you know they
5653080	5657240	i'm sure they have the license it but i'm just gonna slide it in there for the few people that
5657240	5664680	will even get what it is uh phoenix 77 26 says how about trauma center like a game centered around
5664680	5670600	house md i like that one uh tiger claw says how about a video game adaptation of the rocky horror
5670600	5675720	picture show but call it the rocky horror video game show so believe it or not that's already
5675720	5683080	happened except it was um a game adaptation of the play the rocky horror show um and that is on
5683080	5691080	way back in the commodore 64 days uh and uh they did make a new one on cd rom when they did the i
5691080	5695160	think there was a revival i don't remember if they made it around the new york city broadway revival
5695160	5701000	or if it was around a british revival in like 2005 or something like that but spoiler alert
5701000	5710680	neither game can you mute loki loki go on mute classic zoom meeting uh but i guess here's
5710680	5716600	mechanical keyboard but spoiler alert neither rocky horror game was very good um but just
5716600	5719800	if you didn't know they actually did make those games and neither were very good
5719800	5728680	um speaking of uh i said newer phoenix newer uh speaking of um uh things that didn't translate
5728680	5734200	very well phoenix had suggested what would you think of a drag race game they did a dragopolis
5734200	5742280	do you remember that it was on cell phones and also not the best game in the world sorry to say
5742280	5747480	sorry i know some developers probably did their best on it but it was just too limited by the
5747480	5752360	mobile phone and it's just i think that game is not the reason why people watch drag race you
5752360	5757240	know people watch drag race for the horrible puns and the lip syncing and the fun challenges and
5757240	5761400	things like that and as much as i think sure a drag race game would be a great idea and i think
5761400	5766440	i've joked about it before in like a dream game or something have you ever played project runway on
5766440	5771480	the we and let's be real ruble's drag race is a spoof of like project runway and america's next
5771480	5776280	top model it started as a spoof but then it like became self-aware somewhere along the line um
5777000	5784200	but the point is project runaway on the we mama this is garbage it's the best way i could put it
5784200	5788840	it's not good uh so i don't know how a rupaul's drag race game would just like be good like it's
5788840	5794680	just it's just not going to be good um but i suppose you know i i linked in uh twitch chat
5794680	5799880	be linked because thankfully all of these characters oh yeah the Commodore 64 games are in
5799880	5805000	the archive so they have a rocky horror show thank you oh there you go tiger claw go check that out
5805000	5808360	maybe it'll be a classic game of the week sometime although again it's not very good
5808360	5813320	it's really not good all right uh oh and act deft are responding to the nailed it thing and
5813320	5821000	shane's tweet saying rob in mexico a lot of news shows use video game music a lot like no joke
5821000	5826040	it's almost a meme it's kind of funny i don't know why that's so funny anyway well thank you
5826040	5831240	see you tiberi for the email that was good uh moving on to another email from ronma tonight
5831240	5835480	who emailed us participate at orange lounge radio.com and you should too for next week
5835480	5841080	rama asks there hasn't been much in the way of talking about food so here's a question for you
5841080	5848600	all what is your favorite go-to comfort food mine is what some people call roman holiday or goulash
5848600	5854280	it's a mix of pasta sauce meat and cheese i can make a big batch of it and eat it all day and all
5854280	5859800	week and not be bored with it that's all for now till next time i'm sure a lot of people i'm
5859800	5865480	putting on i'm putting on quarantine wait because of all the stinking food i'm eating being trapped
5865480	5871320	at home and there's plenty of comfort food snacks in there but do you have a go-to comfort food
5871960	5878040	loki no but i have important information so you may remember that you know i was obsessed with
5878040	5884440	bond's uh honey butter chicken for a while and they of course closed down and i have not been
5884440	5890840	able to fill that void until recently when i decided to make wings and i found a honey
5890840	5899000	butter recipe that i used and that stuff is crack it is absolute crack i love it i will make as much
5899000	5904520	of that sauce as possible and i will literally now put it on anything and it is awesome so so
5904520	5911640	loki's answer is honey butter basically yes three tablespoons butter three tablespoons honey one
5911720	5917160	tablespoon of soy sauce and chopped garlic probably about two cloves or so mix that all
5917160	5922840	together simmer it in a pot or whatever and just like dip everything in it i did not expect loki
5922840	5926920	would be the one i'm getting cooking tips from on the show don't worry cooking loki will fix it
5927480	5933240	um let's see so my comfort food uh so we have this local chain and they're not paying me to
5933240	5937320	give an advertisement but i'm going to anyway and and loki mentions them all the time on the
5937320	5940280	show anyway because he brings their food in all the time but it's round table pizza i think they're
5940280	5944760	a west coast thing i don't think they have them on the east coast but they have them like arizona
5944760	5951400	and stuff right okay so they're pretty bomb pizza and like the pepperoni and olive specifically
5951400	5956840	takes me back to being a kid and like that used to be the pizza that my grandma would order when
5956840	5960760	i would go like stay with her for a weekend and things like like it would be it would always be
5960760	5964200	exciting times to go to grandma's house for the weekend because she would without fail
5964200	5969960	always order pepperoni and olive pizza from round table which is that's the one we just got so um
5969960	5975160	yeah i guess i gave him free ad but whatever it uh it's it is comfort food i know that's weird
5975160	5978520	because it's not really something you make in your kitchen but i still think comfort food kind of
5978520	5985880	evokes a certain memory um the other one and this would go back to grandma's house as well because
5985880	5992360	she always had a well-stocked cupboard of sour cream and onion pringles because i think they
5992360	5997560	were probably her favorite but they're definitely mine as well and uh i i probably ate or had ate
5997560	6002760	her out of house at home uh on those um sour cream and onion pringles and that would be
6002760	6006840	another comfort food and another company that didn't pay me to give them an ad but it is what
6006840	6013480	it is i mean that's the comfort food i like so um act dev says i do remember them uh round table
6013480	6018200	we used to have one in the city next to where i live i used to play in the arcade it had oh yeah
6018200	6023320	the the i always forget round table like i guess they technically still have arcades but they're
6023320	6028440	you know crappy crane games and things like that but back in the day they have the clubhouse once
6028440	6035480	now they have uh crappy a little bit larger of an arcade yeah but yeah it's still they
6036840	6041240	they still technically each have an arcade but they're like yeah they're crappy but that used
6041240	6048120	to be the place where without fail there was always an iron man iron stewart super off-road
6048120	6051560	game always that game was in every fucking round table i've ever been to
6052200	6056680	and um so that which that game was fucking great it's one of my all-time favorite arcade games we
6056680	6061000	don't talk about it enough on the show how fucking great that game is the first round table and see
6061000	6066120	because this is back pizza places used to be just like i don't know what it is nowadays where
6066120	6070840	everything's all bright and cheery but they used to be dingy and dark that's always like all of
6070840	6075320	these places even like like shakies do you forget am i am i that old that i'm the only one that
6075320	6080680	remembers shaky's pizza but going to shaky's pizza was going to like a fucking like like damp castle
6082200	6088360	with the gigantic doors it was something it was super dark but i remember like um
6088920	6094280	at the first round table i'd ever been to uh i think it's the first one um they used to play
6094280	6099000	pole position there because they used to have this arcade that was kind of just down these stairs and
6099000	6105080	not really like a basement but it was like down some stairs in a room um but yeah it was it was
6105080	6108920	always very dark i remember all of them being dark and even chuckie cheese was like that
6108920	6114520	actually you know what that might have to do with some of the things these uh kind of are
6114520	6117800	derivatives of because now that i didn't really think about this until you mentioned that but
6117800	6124200	now that i think about it like i remember going to a fancy um uh deep dish place in chicago uh it
6124200	6129080	was actually a misty because we were we didn't get to go because the weight was like forever but it
6129080	6133160	was very dark in there and it was all like candle lit type of thing and then i'm thinking have you
6133160	6138360	been to zelda's in downtown sac it's all candle lit it's all dark and candle lit there so i think
6138360	6144040	there's something about like pizza places be and i feel like chicago fire is a pretty dark place
6144040	6147160	too i don't know if it's only like chicago because zelda's is a really good deep dish place i don't
6147160	6151400	know if it's like a deep dish pizza thing or what but i feel like the dark pizza place thing like
6151400	6158200	goes back like it's not just chain restaurants that we remember growing up who knows but then
6158200	6162040	i also remember straw hat which was in a strip mall and it was very bright because the windows
6162040	6167240	were right there so they weren't all dark all right anyway there we go pizza discussion thank
6167240	6171160	you uh rama i hope we didn't let you down with that and rama i know about it because i know
6171160	6176200	you're from new york i know better that it get into the chicago versus new york pizza i'm not
6176200	6181960	going to do that i'm i'm a fat boy and i'm going to say there is room for both there is i love them
6181960	6187480	both so i'm not going to get into the chicago versus new york debate yes to both that is the
6187480	6192920	correct answer what i want to find out though is they have this new pizza place pizza bar place
6193000	6197880	that's opened up um that i haven't been to i keep driving by though it's called boston's pizza
6198520	6205080	and i'm curious to see what boston style pizza is interesting it's just i don't know it's the
6205080	6209160	new pizza place got chicken up do you remember though speaking since we've given chicago pizza
6209160	6215000	a highlight do you remember though there used to be that new york pizza place um it was over in
6215000	6220760	sowsack and it was i don't remember the name of it but they had a max it was the only max 2 machine
6220760	6225320	in town for the longest time and they had some fucking delicious pizza do you remember that place
6226600	6230760	it was no i don't remember no i know you went once it was in south sacramento
6230760	6235240	off fruit ridge or something and like that's that's quite a drive for like i think at the
6235240	6237960	time i was out in roseville or something that's quite a drive down there but it was
6237960	6242040	like the only place in town you can play max 2 for a little bit so anyway
6242040	6252520	uh i i don't think i ever went there act deft in chats no it wasn't godfather's it was it was
6252520	6257080	definitely it was in new york was giovanni's because there is a giovanni one here in sack
6257080	6260280	but it's not in south side but anyway i think it might have been that but anyway it was it
6260280	6265800	was definitely new york pizza um let's see uh act deft in chat says which style of pizza do you
6265800	6273400	prefer yes that is exactly exactly that the only i am not a fan of chicago style pizza
6273960	6278040	yeah i love i love them both like there's a time and a place for both i really do and i
6278040	6281960	understand i understand some people like poo poo on the chicago thing because you're eating
6281960	6286360	it with a knife and a fork so it's not but you know what i'm just i'm i'm not here to debate it
6286360	6294920	i'm just here to eat it if you want to fight me on chicago pizza i will eat that pizza before
6294920	6300200	you're done arguing and then you won't have a problem all right anyway let's move on all right
6300200	6305000	we got past the game exchange and game stop thing uh let's talk about this because this is uh an
6305000	6308680	another unfortunate kind of side effect of everything that's going on in the world and
6308680	6313800	that is that the national game museum is saying that they are in danger of closing because of
6313800	6317720	what's going on with the coronavirus i do want to point out this is the national video game museum
6317720	6324440	in the uk uh and you can follow them on twitter at nvmuk and they actually made a tweet saying
6324520	6329640	we need your help the uk's only museum dedicated to video game culture and education is threatened
6329640	6335720	with permanent closure by coronavirus despite 40 000 visitors in 2019 we have no safety net of
6335720	6340920	funding to ensure our new charity atlas a prolonged shutdown the uk is in danger of
6340920	6346120	losing this unique venue with nearly 100 playable exhibits school workshops and family events so
6346120	6350920	they're actually doing a crowdfunding page to try to i guess make up some of the stop gap that
6350920	6356200	they're losing because you know we're on a shutdown here in the us in most states
6356200	6362920	i think there are better than the yelp crowdfund idea that they oh yeah oh god that was horrible
6362920	6367080	that was horrible no this isn't this is a officially sanctioned by and on their official
6367080	6373960	twitter uh and nvmuk yeah if you guys didn't hear about that yelp man that's so shitty what they did
6373960	6379800	they were setting up uh crowdfunding things and the owners didn't even know about it all the time
6379800	6385960	it's just really shady anyway um anyway but this is official and is something you should look uh
6385960	6390920	be checking into especially if you are over in the uk but you can certainly help uh from anywhere so
6390920	6397560	um check that out over on their official twitter for more information nvmuk all right let's move
6397560	6401720	on loki what do you have for us before we get towards the end of the show here so this is
6401720	6411960	amazing uh but there's actually a new game coming from atari it's a pong rpg so it's pong quest and
6411960	6417880	it looks very cute it's got these qt graphics and you play like a pong paddle that's dressed up in
6417880	6424920	costumes and you fight other pong paddles as well so they have character customization and it's a
6424920	6431640	very tongue-in-cheek looking game it's being developed by uh uk design duo uh checkered inc
6433000	6437800	huh it's supposed to be coming out in consoles and pc this spring it's interesting to see all
6437800	6441960	the different ways they've reinvented pong over the years that's for sure yeah they have like
6441960	6447160	incorporate other atari games into it so they have like uh stuff in the trailer about centipede and
6447160	6453480	adventure so it's kind of cool very cool all right and one more story for you guys about you know
6453480	6459240	what what is sorry it has an autoplay video on the site uh what what are they doing on sports tv
6459240	6463160	when there's no sports um because we're not able to get together in sporting arenas and things like
6463160	6466920	that and of course as we've talked about over the last few weeks there seems to be this growing
6466920	6473720	trend into esports and espn took that up another notch this past weekend i must admit i didn't see
6473720	6478440	it maybe some of you in chat did and want to tell me about it but my understanding is that the nba
6478440	6484840	and 2k kind of came together to do an nba 2k tournament that was on espn and espn 2 and it
6484840	6489320	actually all started on friday and it's running through april 11th so we're in the middle of it
6489320	6495080	right now um it was uh on espn on friday with a half hour pre-show and then they ran it um
6495960	6501400	on espn for like an hour and a half and it went over to espn 2 uh and there are 16 nba players
6501400	6506600	competing including kevin durant uh donovan mitchell devin booker so there's lots of uh
6506600	6513480	nba celebrities competing in this the winner of the event will get 100 000 to give to a charity
6513480	6518120	supporting coronavirus relief specifically so that's going to be a win-win situation
6518120	6525320	um all together and uh is definitely an example of what you got to do on tv right now to um
6525880	6530600	fill in the time because we don't know when the nba or any of that stuff is coming back and it's
6530600	6534840	kind of like something i alluded to earlier in the show you know a lot of these sports events have
6535640	6541240	thousands of people that go to the arenas and they may not want those large gatherings for a little
6541240	6548920	while um maybe they'll allow and again i'm just fortune telling here listen to doctors as a
6548920	6554680	scientist maybe they'll allow smaller groups like 50 so that maybe they can get the the the people
6554680	6558120	there to record the game and play the game and maybe that'll be okay maybe they just play it
6558120	6562520	to empty stadiums but we don't know we we just don't know the future is kind of uncertain in
6562520	6568360	that way um so they're having to fill the time right now with what to do um sj100 matt says the
6568360	6572200	reviews i've read is that it's kind of boring i don't know if these reviewers are gamers but i
6572200	6576360	think people were expecting players to heavy trash talk each other and they're not doing that it's
6576360	6580600	kind of quiet between the players i have yet to see it so it's kind of what the early vibe seems
6580600	6585000	to say is that maybe it's not the side of the players we're used to seeing on the court because
6585000	6588360	it's a little more casual maybe because for charity they're toning it down i don't know
6588840	6593080	um act f says some soccer leagues are doing something similar and i think f1 racing is also
6593080	6598120	doing it and streaming it on twitch and bobby blackwolf says espn was showing the madden
6598120	6603960	championships today but it was a rerun from back in december and january so uh very interesting
6603960	6610840	to see the sports um folks having to really fill time i mean on the good side of things
6611400	6619000	there's no bars right now to gather to see these in anyway but i'm sure these tv companies are like
6619000	6623960	that's our bread and butter what are we going to do so it seems you know like definitely these um
6623960	6628440	online things are kind of filling in the gap a little bit so that you know people will still uh
6628440	6633880	be there to tune in and the flip side of that might be that tv ends up being the only way to
6633880	6637960	participate in these things for a little while so there might you know might be a little time
6637960	6643080	of weirdness but then it's going to kind of pay off double hopefully um well i don't know i'd
6643080	6646920	rather go back to the old way but you know what i mean uh for the folks that all are working and
6646920	6651960	making the tv they can um get back into that hopefully a little earlier than everything else
6651960	6658600	we'll see so all right nifty 805 says chicken wing sales are down yeah when there's no football
6658600	6664520	parties that's not necessarily true chicken wings are very hard to find really well but wingstop is
6664520	6669880	like that half their business comes from uh ball games and things like that i'm sure well true i'm
6669880	6674280	talking about like in stores because people keep uh oh yeah that's doing awesome i've had to go
6674280	6678200	like see recently when i go grocery shopping i have to go to three stores to get everything that
6678200	6685240	we need yeah uh which is not necessarily fun but it's been less crazy this week um i did end up i
6685240	6691640	found paper towels which is ridiculous um that was a random thing i found early on too is paper
6691640	6697080	towels and luckily we have plenty of toilet paper because alan like the week before we went on the
6697080	6702680	cruise alan bought some and then that was when all hell broke loose so anyway uh it is time for the
6702680	6706360	listener roundtable i'm sorry it's a typo there in the sidebar because i used an old template it's
6706360	6709720	listed around table via chat tonight we're not gonna be able to do discord so if you have any
6709720	6714920	questions for us in chat uh go ahead and put those in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network
6714920	6720360	if you have anything uh you'd like to ask us there uh pod culture and chat saying yeah even wonderfest
6720360	6728360	is up in the air now i am accepting the reality that dragon con could not happen i'm crossing my
6728360	6733720	fingers and toes that it does but i think there's just a lot of unanswered question marks still on
6733720	6738840	the whole thing uh again just because we can get back to some sense of normalcy are they going to
6738840	6744040	want 80 000 people to get together i don't know again i think it's just too early to say um i did
6744040	6751640	buy my flights this past week because here this is what i think will happen flights are really
6751640	6756440	cheap right now i don't know if you're aware but flights are really cheap right now so i wanted to
6756440	6762280	get in on the good deal because i have a feeling when they do say it's okay to fly again you're
6762280	6768040	gonna have all these business travelers snatching it up to catch up on lost work and the price of
6768040	6772280	those air tickets is gonna go way up because that backlog of people who haven't been able to travel
6772280	6776600	for a while are gonna suddenly want to do it so that's just you know i i don't know anything and
6776600	6781480	if airlines do close or whatever i feel like airline tickets may be a little harder to come
6781480	6786520	by for a bit so i wanted to lock that in now and the airline that i'm flying has a pretty generous
6786520	6791000	refund policy in this scenario you can imagine like they they change their policies specifically
6791000	6797240	for things bought in the month of april uh and and march so i feel okay about it that if if for
6797240	6801240	whatever reason the convention doesn't happen i could still use that money and just put it towards
6801240	6807640	2021 or go on a different trip when it's more appropriate too i don't know so we'll see again
6808200	6814760	it's too early to say but i i am mentally preparing myself to be disappointed because it would be very
6814760	6820760	disappointing but i yeah it i mean it is what it is we have to save lives so that's the most
6820760	6826360	important thing so uh anyhow uh dart tetsuya is wondering hey have any of you all seen king's
6826360	6831000	avatar on netflix it's a chinese drama but it's all about this online mmo thing a bunch of
6831000	6835720	different guilds playing together no i haven't heard of that is it um is it like a documentary
6835720	6843480	or is it just a scripted thing that's kind of interesting be curious about that so let's see
6843480	6851400	also um oh yeah some folks are talking about wrestlemania um because that's a sporting event
6851400	6856040	that's going on right now peso paca says wrestlemania was definitely odd how quiet it is
6856040	6860280	outside of hearing the narrators and wrestlers screaming and grunts yeah i bet that was really
6860280	6865480	weird and i guess they did that at their own facility they didn't do it um they didn't like
6865480	6869160	empty out a stadium or anything like that like they kind of did it in their own studio or
6869160	6873080	something i didn't watch it so i couldn't tell you but i'm sure a lot of you guys were watching
6873080	6877800	it and i'm sure i have plenty to say about it uh okay dark tetsuya says uh that was a scripted
6877800	6885160	drama so interesting all right nifty by the way in chat is linking to an article one thing there's
6885160	6890440	definitely no short of right now is chicken wings so i guess that's just at your local store loki i
6890440	6895240	don't know it probably was yeah we went to the store yesterday because we were starting to run
6895240	6899640	out of some things and oh but i don't want to i you can see how there's some people that just
6899640	6906040	don't care about like what's going on and being very careless so i'm just like oh meanwhile i'm
6906040	6911160	like i don't have any face masks but i have a scarf from those trips i've taken back east when
6911160	6914520	it's cold so i kind of like wrap the scarf around my face that's like all i could do
6915800	6918840	even though i wasn't coughing or anything but still you know just to
6918840	6921400	just out of an abundance of caution so anyway
6923080	6928360	all right well any last minute stories for us loki yes um so i wanted to talk about because
6928360	6934120	we didn't talk about i mean obviously this week april fool's day was and and i understand that
6934120	6939080	a lot of people think april fools is canceled yeah i'm one of them that's why i didn't slot it
6939320	6948200	so one company though that took it very seriously of course is mojang and mojang released a brand
6948200	6956920	new snapshot from minecraft that's absolutely incredible so it's called snapshot 20w14 infinity
6956920	6964840	and is the ultimate content update now what did they do to the game they added two billion worlds
6965720	6975080	into the game based on player input and um so what this does is actually you know in minecraft
6975080	6981160	there's another portal that'll take you to the nether so with this update if you take a book
6981880	6987640	in the game and you write whatever you want in the book that creates a new seed for a brand new
6988840	6994360	universe basically that you throw it into the portal walk through it and it'll take you to
6994440	7000680	one of these procedurally generated worlds based on your seed that you create so it's all sorts of
7000680	7006680	weird glitchy looking things that are out there plus there's several different uh worlds that they
7006680	7012600	made themselves kind of like easter eggs that you can work to as well or find amongst all of these
7012600	7017080	two billion worlds that are in there and at first like when i saw like the youtube videos i thought
7017080	7021320	oh this is just like people trying to play pranks but i saw more and more of them and actually
7021320	7027800	watched you know how it works and no it's a legit update that adds a ton of replayability
7027800	7035400	into the game and funny enough they added an advancement or achievement into the game
7035400	7041560	for visiting one billion of those worlds so you know visit one billion of them in order to get
7041560	7046920	that achievement but they have all sorts of weird stuff in there and brand new blocks that they
7046920	7053240	created specifically for this now this is aside from um the nether update which is supposed to
7053240	7058360	be coming as well to java but i mean i can't wait to check this out i downloaded this today to go
7058360	7063480	um play around in it but i haven't gotten a chance to play it yet because i need to reload all my uh
7064120	7069000	i had some scripts for using controllers in the java version and stuff like that because i have
7069000	7074360	a new pc now i got reload all that stuff and it sucks but yeah it's really crazy just some of the
7074360	7080200	stuff that generates in this game so right there's uh they have like skyblock stuff in there now
7080200	7086280	there's just a bunch of weird dimensions that this is created so um worth checking out if you
7086280	7092680	have the java version go download the beta client or the snapshot release and go jump into a billion
7092680	7101000	different worlds all right anything else uh that's it all right let me get this last question here
7101000	7105960	from s100 max i think this is a good one uh over in our chat question because i'm finding new ways
7105960	7112200	to entertain myself i challenged myself to 100 super mario world within a week on just pure
7112200	7117080	memory no online checking are there any games that you know so well you can pick it up and
7117080	7122120	beat without researching anything uh i might struggle a little bit especially in the water
7122120	7130440	levels but uh super metroid i'm pretty sure i could uh pecking crash my way through uh probably
7130440	7135240	final fantasy two and three which are really four and six of course on super nintendo i could
7135240	7138280	probably get through those again too but those those are actually kind of linear i don't think
7138280	7143160	it's that hard to pick those games up and um you know because everything is kind of like gated you
7143160	7146680	know like metroid can't get to this point unless you have this can't get to this point unless you
7146680	7151240	have this so um i don't know if either of those answers are as impressive but i feel like those
7151240	7154760	are two games i could definitely pick up uh loki what about you is there something you could like
7154840	7163000	pick up in full clear just from muscle memory um i don't know like it would have to i can't think
7163000	7168040	of an older game that i would have played so much of that i could do that oh uh akuma jp says i
7168040	7172280	think sftn symphony of the night i think um it would be yeah symphony of the night that's a good
7172280	7177000	one too i bet that's one jamie could do uh act f says i could also do shovel knight from memory oh
7177000	7183480	that's a pretty good one as well so nice bobby blackwolf says adventure for the 2600 so
7184760	7188840	that's another one that well no actually some some parts of that can be pretty tricky i think
7188840	7192280	so but there's some other ones i'd like to challenge myself with like the original metal
7192280	7196680	gear on nes i bet that would be a fun one to try again see if i can remember how to get through
7196680	7200760	some of those mazes and things like that all right anyway we're gonna wrap up for the night
7200760	7205000	thank you guys so much for uh tuning into orange launch radio or watching us live however you
7205000	7208840	decided to uh participate with the show tonight uh if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange
7208840	7212200	launch radio help us spread the word tell a friend or two about the show because we are
7212200	7216280	the show where every gamer has a voice but the voices have to be here to put on air
7216280	7222200	uh so help us spread the word we really appreciate it um uh auto hosting on twitch that goes a super
7222200	7226760	long way really appreciate that but otherwise just tell a friend or two where you might have heard
7226760	7231240	about this show uh and how to find it and that would be awesome a nice five-star review on a
7231240	7238280	podcasting site like itunes those go a long way as well uh and again just take care of yourself guys
7238280	7243160	uh take it seriously what doctors out there are saying um staying at home means you got to stay
7243160	7246600	at home like as much as you want to see your friends and you're probably uh really want to
7246600	7249640	hang out with them like i would love to yeah you know there was a part of me that was like
7249640	7254520	why don't i just have loki over it's just loki but then i thought well it's you're you know who
7254520	7258920	knows i may be sick and not really showing it and then you know i don't want to i don't want to give
7258920	7263320	that to loki so uh staying away from people means staying away from people and if we can work
7263320	7269880	together uh we will uh get rid of this thing a lot faster so please stay safe stay healthy
7269880	7274280	make good choices and all that good stuff um with that loki your final thought tonight
7275640	7281800	my final thought is i'm gonna play more uh try to play more games i've been trying to get to
7281800	7288040	where i can programming um i've worked so like this week i've got uh replacement parts coming
7288040	7293400	from my switch as well because my switch has been acting up um so i'm gonna fix the joy cons
7293400	7299320	manually and but i still have an issue with the stupid sd card we're like literally just holding
7299320	7304360	the switch and it keeps saying that the sd card is being disconnected so there's something weird
7304360	7311560	at that so i'm gonna take it apart and hopefully not break it good luck with that uh where i'm
7311560	7316760	actually getting some new computer parts as well because my main computer uh keeps freezing suddenly
7316760	7320200	like it doesn't happen all the time but i i was wondering if it's like an overheating thing or
7320200	7323800	something is it'll like freeze in the middle of a game i have to shut the system off bring it back
7323800	7329400	up but i don't know it's just it's just really annoying me so check your fans and make sure
7329400	7333880	they're not they are we give it we give it a big dusting we took the and it still did a freeze up
7333880	7338920	on me so i don't know what the hell's going on so um i was like well maybe it's an excuse to buy
7338920	7342920	some new computer parts i've been wanting a new video card anyway you know so we'll order them
7342920	7346600	and they'll get here when they get here because you know i know all that stuff is not essential
7346760	7353640	and it's fine new weeks shipping pretty fast are they saying all right we'll see we'll see um okay
7353640	7358600	akuma jp says stop downloading porn it's not it's not porn that's causing it's final fantasy 14
7358600	7364360	unless you consider fantasy 14 porn which you might i don't know um so my final thought is um
7364360	7369400	yay i i hope to get new computer parts soon as well and i will definitely be playing more near
7369400	7374280	automata this week and i'll talk more about it on next week's show so with that have a great week
