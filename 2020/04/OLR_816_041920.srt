00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,240
This week, Facebook makes game streaming a first-year citizen. The ESRB adds new rating

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,960
information and Beat Saber works to keep you healthy. There's also speculation, sad news,

3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,180
squabbles, and plenty more to discuss. So let's kick off episode two to the power of three

4
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,180
and four right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,180
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,180
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

7
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,020
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 816

8
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:49,620
of our show for this April the 19th of 2020. My name is Rob Roberts, joining you live and

9
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,340
here in our studio that usually we all gather live in, but due to the circumstances going

10
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,460
on in the real world right now, of course, we are recording over distance. So thanks

11
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,740
to the magic of Discord, I am joined by the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,740
Oh, hi.

13
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,740
Hi, how are you?

14
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:13,020
I'm doing all right. It's been a long day and a long week and the better times are ahead.

15
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:22,180
Well, let me be the first to say tonight. Happy birthday, DarkSakura. It is your birthday.

16
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:26,620
Yes, it is. And I am this many years old.

17
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,620
And she's holding up 21 fingers.

18
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:37,940
Oh, well, don't tell people where I got those hands from. Okay. But anyway, yeah, it's my

19
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:46,540
my birthday. I was squirted out a while ago. Wow. pain and general disappointment of the

20
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,540
world.

21
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:53,220
Well, congratulations on hitting a milestone. I know I know that birthdays during the pandemic

22
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,860
are a little because, you know, I've known quite a few people at this point who've who've

23
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,140
had birthdays, but hopefully you're able to kind of make the best of the situation and

24
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,780
you get a makeup birthday when this is all over.

25
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,760
I reckon so. And Phoenix7726 said happy 21st. Now you can have a drink. I've been day drinking

26
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,220
all day. I started 11.

27
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,300
What's your drink of choice today?

28
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:26,340
Well, a good friend who I think she's been on the show a long time ago, sent me a bottle

29
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:33,220
of Godiva chocolate liqueur, which I have just had the biggest craving for for like,

30
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:39,020
at least since I had better lung capacity. So maybe after I was first done with the actual

31
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:46,420
sick part of pneumonia. So, yeah, and I have my bottle and it makes me happy and I've been

32
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:52,500
pouring it in coffee and also some Kraken, which I'm not drinking anything right now.

33
00:02:52,500 --> 00:03:00,700
I have one left of my Trader Joe's chocolate Botswin stout. So I'm going to have that tonight.

34
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,620
I should have brought the can to Frivolo and left it on your doorstep, but I took a nap.

35
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,180
I took a nap. I took a very important nap. Well, you know what? It'll just be one of

36
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,140
those things I'll have to do midweek.

37
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,860
You can work from home and tomorrow and just drop it off after the show. I got you.

38
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:22,580
I do. I do work from home right now. Yeah. And I'm very fortunate. I'm a big. Yeah. I know there's

39
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:27,340
a lot of just like instability with things going on out there. So I trust me. I'm very,

40
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,820
very thankful for the situation I'm given right now.

41
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:35,860
SSJ 100 Matt asked how the stout is and given that it's on one of my lists of favorites and

42
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:41,500
I will sometimes drink it over a Guinness. Yeah. It's pretty good. Ooh. Mel Chan 13 in

43
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,300
chat says I have a whiskey ginger lemonade. It is tasty. That sounds really good. It's very close.

44
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,980
You say ginger. My absolute favorite drink is a Moscow mule bonus points. If you can actually

45
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,380
serve it in the copper cup. So, uh, yeah, that kind of made me think of that. Cause it's,

46
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,460
I'm one of those girls that I get very expensive whiskey and I drink it neat.

47
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,500
All right. Well, we know what to get you for your birthday. So, so lately I've actually had to drink

48
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:11,060
whiskey and bourbon on the rocks just because it hits me so much faster. Um, now, uh, they're

49
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,340
saying in chat that you actually like your audio qualities actually sounds better tonight, but I

50
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:20,060
think that I don't think you've changed mics. I think that may be a side effect of your like

51
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,580
healthier than you've been in weeks. Right. Oh yeah, no. Um, I, my whole medication, uh,

52
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:32,140
like regimen has been, uh, bumped up quite a bit. I still, I still get a little short of breath,

53
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:39,020
but I feel like I've got better, better vocal capacity. Um, and uh, yeah, and I have been

54
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:44,220
drinking, so maybe that helped. That's right. And by the way, we are reading shout outs in

55
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,900
our chat room because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network,

56
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:53,660
twitch.tv slash vog network, V O G voice of geeks network. And we are on at six o'clock Pacific

57
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:59,740
nine o'clock Eastern ish right after the Bobby black Wolf show. And, uh, also speaking of voice

58
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:07,100
quality and I think improved voice quality, let's say hello to tech master Loki. Hello. Hi, how are

59
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:12,700
you? I'm fine. You sound much better. You do not sound like you're on a tin can anymore. This is

60
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:19,820
great. Well, that's because before I was on a webcam mic and now I'm on a rock band mic. I love

61
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:25,260
it. You are legit on a rocket for a PlayStation two, like USB mic. It was an X-Box three 60,

62
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:29,260
but yeah, it's the, the old logitech mic. So they used to actually, I don't even think this is from

63
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:34,060
rock band. I think this may be from karaoke revolution. Um, just had it leftover from all

64
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:40,220
that stuff, but Oh my, they're all compatible. Oh my God. I have one of those that, that sealed

65
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:45,660
karaoke revolution country. That's been sitting in the studio. Who knew there's a freaking mic

66
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,220
in there. Maybe that's how I fixed some that are watching on Twitch will notice I'm using a

67
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,620
different mic too, because I think, you know, we upgraded the mics in the studio a few months ago,

68
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,860
but I honestly think they've been causing more problems, which is unfortunate. So I'm actually

69
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,780
trying to switch mics tonight to try to get some of the popping, um, to calm down a little bit.

70
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,420
Maybe I need to switch to the fricking karaoke. I'm looking around, but they're all USB mics,

71
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,580
but they're not bad. And this one must be brand new because it's wrapped up nicely. The cord is

72
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,340
wrapped up neatly because whenever I rewrap that it's never going to be like that again.

73
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:21,100
So, um, yeah. Rob girl, you are not Alyssa Edwards. Stop the popping.

74
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:29,500
Oh, okay. Uh, let's see going to our chat. Uh, yeah, a lot of compliments on Loki sound tonight

75
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,060
and people are, are really hilariously digging the fact that you're using a rock band mic

76
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,420
and people's confessing. This is just, this is like a, it's a good entry-level podcast, Mike.

77
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,260
Maybe that's the advice we want to give to people that want to use this opportunity to start a

78
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:48,860
podcast, which unlike Twitter and people trying to be funny on Twitter who are not funny, ever

79
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:54,300
funny, uh, saying, Oh, please, whatever you do, don't start a podcast. Uh, to that, I say,

80
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:00,620
fuck that. I say, absolutely yes. Start a podcast, especially if you think you're the type of person

81
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,940
who shouldn't be podcasting and you probably are the type of person that should be podcasting.

82
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:11,260
And I think this is great advice. Dust off your rock band or karaoke, uh, karaoke revolution

83
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:16,140
microphones. And you've got a good starter kit right there. Uh, VGRealness when VGRealness did

84
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:20,940
a podcast, we did it with four separate rock and Mike and Mike's attached to a USB hub.

85
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:27,260
Uh, Bobby says my first podcast microphone was a karaoke microphone. Um, tiger class

86
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,180
says someday you'll get one of those mic holder things that you mount on a desk so that you don't

87
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:36,140
always have to hold it. Uh, yes, I want to get one of those like elaborate, like hook type things,

88
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,700
because the problem is I do have, we do have like a tiny baby stand. I had one sitting around here

89
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,180
cause, um, dark soccer was using it for like two weeks before this whole thing started. Um,

90
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,380
but it's too, it's, it confines like I would have to sit here and talk like this for the entire show

91
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,380
and it would be very awkward. So I need something that lets me move a little more naturally because

92
00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:00,540
I think I paid five bucks for it. Yeah. I think granted when we are all in the same room, which

93
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,700
is how this podcast is intended to be, obviously we're not right now because of the state of the

94
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,460
world and setting a good example, but when we're in the same room, we'd like to kind of look at

95
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,820
each other and interact and play off each other and stuff. Um, and so I think movement is very

96
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:19,340
important and not, and that's why I've always been a big proponent of hand mics. Although most

97
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:24,700
podcasters would think I am nuts, but I'm like, there's positives and there's negatives. The

98
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:29,580
positive is I get an additional energy off being able to feed off my co-hosts that I think a lot

99
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,580
of people don't always get. So, and that's the type of stuff you have to weigh for what works

100
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:40,780
for you. So anyway, uh, tiger class says, have you thought of headset mics? Um, yes. Uh, in fact,

101
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:46,860
I think, aren't you using one right now? I am. I'm using my work mic. Um, not, I mean, it's,

102
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,740
it's one of those Jabra mics. They're not cheap. I mean, but I think it sounds okay. Sounds pretty

103
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,140
good. Honestly, in the perfect world, I'd have those little lavalier mics, just like they have

104
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:01,260
on, um, the nightly news or, you know, when you, uh, professional grade stuff that that's ideal

105
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:06,620
for me, honestly. So, um, who knows, maybe with enough biddies and subs, we'll get there. I'm just,

106
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,780
I'm teasing what, I'm not really going to beg for money. Although certainly we always welcome

107
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:15,020
that type of stuff. And it does go back to running the show and all that good stuff. But, um,

108
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,980
who knows? We'll see. Uh, the nice thing is, again, not that any of this going on in the

109
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,940
real world right now is nice, but if there is a silver lining, I don't know about you guys,

110
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:31,660
but I'm saving money because I'm not driving. Uh, I'm not going out to eat as much. I'm not like,

111
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,140
there's certain places where I'm like actually saving money. And again, I completely realize

112
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,860
there are other people right now that are in a very much financial hardship. So I don't want

113
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,540
to sound like I'm, I'm, uh, unaware of, of some of that privilege that I have with, with my work

114
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:51,580
situation, everything, but I am able to kind of like save money so I can hopefully maybe invest

115
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:57,340
in some of those things. So for what it's worth. So anyway, our gas bill though has been much

116
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:03,180
higher because Dan has been, well, he cooked the entire time that I've had pneumonia and since,

117
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:08,540
since I was still recovering. So yeah, that's, and yeah, Alan's been doing a lot of cooking around

118
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,540
here too. Like he made muffins the other day. That's never happened. So that's fun. So,

119
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,260
all right. Uh, anyhow, let's actually, we, we are a video game show, so let's get into talking about

120
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:21,260
some video games. Although this kickoff topic tonight is a little bit like video games are

121
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,900
like a part of it, but it does have to do with, um, somewhat kind of like our world situation

122
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,700
right now, where most of us are staying at home. In fact, everybody really should be staying at

123
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:35,500
home unless you are in a country that is somehow unaffected by this. But I think every country is

124
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,340
at this point. Um, so most people are staying at home so that they're not, you know, spreading the,

125
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,620
well, and you're not staying at home if you're an essential worker, that's, that's what I'm looking

126
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:51,500
for. Um, and so, um, many people are, um, trying to, you know, with the gym's clothes and, um,

127
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,860
other ways that maybe have been ways that you were getting fit before, maybe like walking to

128
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,100
a subway or walking to transit or a bus or something and back, maybe you're not doing

129
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,460
that as much anymore. Um, so you're looking for other ways to get, uh, fitness. And so video games

130
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:13,420
is a big kind of method for that for a lot of people. Uh, and, uh, kind of knowing that that

131
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:19,580
is the case, one big video game this week released a kind of fitness related song.

132
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:24,700
Uh, Beat Saber is the game. And of course, a lot of you guys know, Beat Saber is a hugely popular

133
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:29,580
VR game. It's almost in some ways, the, the flagship, the Wii Sports of VR, almost, I don't

134
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,420
know Half-Life, Alyx might be there soon, but I think a lot of people recognize Beat Saber as like

135
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:39,020
one of the VR games. And of course, Beat Saber is a music-based game and it's kind of a workout.

136
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,300
You know, when you're waving those hands around frantically and, you know, you're kind of trying

137
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:47,180
to dodge pillars in that game, so you're moving your whole body up, down, side, side, it can be

138
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:53,580
quite a bit of a workout. Well, uh, there was a new song released this week called Fitbit,

139
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:59,260
excuse me, Fitbeat, excuse me. It is a free official song and is going to help you get a

140
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,940
workout. And in fact, looking at the preview video, they're playing it an expert or whatever

141
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,860
the most hardcore mode is. And it looks like a heck of a workout. Luckily, I'm sure there's

142
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,660
easier modes that I could actually play. But the interesting thing about Fitbeat is that the song

143
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:18,220
is actually designed to, to give your body a workout. So it's designed with the step pattern.

144
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,700
I say step pattern because my mind goes to DDR, but you know, with the note pattern and that

145
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,460
in mind to really work your body out. And I thought that was kind of a neat

146
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:31,900
concept is that, you know, especially when you consider this particular show's roots in music

147
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,620
gaming and the fact that, you know, a lot of us back in the day in 2002, when we started,

148
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,260
we're using things like Dance Dance Revolution and Power Power Paradise, and, you know, those

149
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,540
types of games for fitness as well as fun. It's, it's kind of interesting that in this world

150
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:51,820
situation, we have Beat Saber is one option of many. We'll talk about some of those other

151
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:56,700
options in a minute. Beat Saber is kind of one option for people to stay fit. And now it's like,

152
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,340
not only is it just that you're playing the game to be fit, but this is designed with fitness in

153
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:05,980
mind. It's kind of like, uh, you guys remember Dance Dance Revolution on the PlayStation 2

154
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,980
had like a fitness mode, right? Did you guys ever use fitness mode to actually be fit?

155
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,140
Well, not to be fit just as a personal challenge. How so?

156
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,940
Just to keep up with it. Can I do this? Can I do this round?

157
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,060
Okay. Um, did you guys actually, let me, let me sidetrack a little bit. How,

158
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:29,020
you know, especially because if in a weird way, the DDR stuff is kind of older at this point,

159
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,620
right? Dance Dance Revolution and all that was, you know, 10 plus years ago when we were playing

160
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,740
that stuff on the PlayStation 2, what was the fitness mode and what was the fitness kind of

161
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:46,140
like in those games? It's similar to the arcade. Basically it calculates the number of steps that

162
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:52,060
you're taking based on the steps that are in the song and assigns it a calorie value based on that.

163
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:57,580
That's how the, um, like I think a, and I don't even know when they started, but with all the,

164
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:04,540
um, profiles and everything on there, they do calculate, uh, calorie burning in there as well,

165
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,060
based on the number of steps and difficulty of the song, right. And maybe beat him or something

166
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:13,660
like that. And it's super inaccurate. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's, it's a little bit rudimentary,

167
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:18,620
um, because it's, it's, I don't think it's taking into account height or weight or any of that when

168
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:23,420
it does the calorie calculation, does it? I think you can set it up online when you're

169
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,140
setting up your, your account, um, to actually put your height and weight in there, but yeah,

170
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:32,300
it's still pretty even, yeah. Even then, you know, everybody is different. So it's,

171
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:37,580
it's going to be an estimation at best. Um, lots of folks in chat lighting up on this topic,

172
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,500
uh, cause I know we have a lot of old school music game fans and chat, uh, pixel pocket says I've

173
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,860
been playing a ridiculous amount of DDR with my step mania stage. Uh, Mel Chan said, uh, I wanted

174
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,460
to get ring fit adventure, but it's gone through the roof price wise. We'll talk, come back and

175
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:56,060
talk about ring fit adventure in a bit. Uh, mr Rizzo's in chat, uh, says I'm still playing

176
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:02,540
just dance. So kind of like a cousin to DDR kind of like a modern, you know, day, uh, dance game.

177
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,940
Uh, obviously those games are still huge. I'm still playing just dance in sweat mode to try

178
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:13,340
to keep moving. You know, and I've seen tweets of even in this type of situation, I've saw tweets

179
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:18,220
of friends who are setting up their old school PlayStation two, or I think in this one case,

180
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:24,860
I saw an Xbox three 60 Matt with the universe games, um, setting that up on the wooden panels

181
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:30,460
to prevent the mats from bunching up and like, like this is my workout regime right now because

182
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:34,700
24 hour fitness is closed or whatever it is. Or, you know, I know a lot of people are still going

183
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,180
outside, which is, it's a good thing. Doctors recommend you should still be going outside for

184
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,300
30 minutes a day, just as long as you're maintaining social distance rules and everything

185
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:48,060
like that. But not everybody necessarily wants to run outside or, you know, exercise and sweat

186
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:52,700
and all that outside. Maybe, maybe going outside is literally just catching some sun and you want

187
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,980
to do the working out in the comfort of your own home. That's, you know, so a lot of people set up

188
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:04,060
those types of home gym types of setups and video games are a great way to do that. So, um, anyhow,

189
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:09,660
uh, continuing with the fit beat story, uh, if you want to grab this song, it is free. It's available

190
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:16,380
for PlayStation VR, as well as Oculus steam. Uh, it works with the one saber mode and 360 degree

191
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,300
modes in addition to the regular two saber. So they, they flushed out with all the different

192
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,860
modes that beat saber supports. Um, and I know when I've played beat saber on PlayStation VR,

193
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,260
where I own it, I get quite a bit of exercise from that game. So that is a good way, I think,

194
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:34,380
to get some exercise. I also really liked Otica, which is another music game. You don't flail quite

195
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:38,460
as much, but I think it's still a bit of workout and that's a really good one as well. Although,

196
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:45,020
um, not everything has to be VR for exercise. Not everybody necessarily enjoys VR. Uh, some people

197
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:50,300
may find working out with that headset a little awkward. Um, so there's certainly other ways to

198
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:55,580
do it, such as we had just dance was mentioned, uh, old school DDR and those types of games

199
00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:00,780
and ring fit adventure, uh, and SSJ 100 Matt and our chat at twitch.tv slash VOG network says,

200
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:06,140
I've been playing ring fit adventure since this whole thing started. I lost five pounds playing

201
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:13,260
it in the past 30 days and feeling stronger in my arms and legs. Still hate doing squats though,

202
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:17,660
but squats are awesome and Final Fantasy seven remake, just saying, anyway, um,

203
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:24,300
Bobby Blackwell says, Otica is arm day. Uh, Beat Saber does some leg day. Uh, Bobby says,

204
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:29,820
pull out your old Wii fit. Uh, and she hold 10 kind of, uh, piggybacks on that saying

205
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:36,060
we tennis. Absolutely. Uh, so there's all sorts of ways that people are using video games to stay

206
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:40,780
fit. I'm kind of curious for my co-hosts and that we've heard from some of the chatters,

207
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:46,300
but if you guys want to expand on that more, are you guys using video games at all to stay

208
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:51,260
fit and get X exercise during this? If so, like what is kind of your routine?

209
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:59,180
Um, well, I've been playing step mania on my arcade cabinet, so doing that a little bit.

210
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,100
Oh yeah. You're not as much, you're fortunate to have the whole stinking cabinet in your garage.

211
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:09,100
That's pretty good. Yeah. Not as much as I would like to be, but, um, easy myself back in there.

212
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:14,700
Nice. Uh, dark Sakura, I don't know if you have cause you've been kind of sick, but anything.

213
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:21,820
I've been a lot sick. Yeah. So I've done two things, Jack and shit. So, um, no plans

214
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:26,620
maybe now that you're feeling better. Well, I'm going to try to see if I have the lung

215
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:35,260
capacity to take an actual walk around my block tomorrow. But, um, you know, um, Dan and I talked

216
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:42,380
about busting out the dream cast for second, uh, for second mix, just kind of off hand. Um,

217
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,180
um, I'm kind of thinking I might do the DDR thing again, but just so far, I've just been doing,

218
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:52,700
um, standard exercise, uh, yoga while listening to, uh, my, uh, my favorite podcasts really.

219
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,660
Including orange sounds radio. I'm just kidding.

220
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:03,820
But I do subscribe to us. Okay. That's good. That's good. Um, go ahead.

221
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:09,020
Oh, but you know, if, if anyone wants to know what my favorite podcasts are to ask me later,

222
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:15,260
I will tell you, cause they're awesome people. Um, I will say the one answer that nobody said

223
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:22,460
yet, uh, is my good old GPS games. I use a lot when walking, um, Orna has been a big one lately,

224
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,980
just because that's kind of been the game of the moment. But also the nice thing about Orna

225
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:32,780
is that it's not tied to, um, pokey stops or, you know, certain areas specifically, uh, Jamie,

226
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:37,580
we can hear your keyboard, just, you know, um, that's all right. Uh, so it's not tied to like

227
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,980
specific places like pokey stops and gyms of monsters and those types of things and Orna

228
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:47,100
spawn everywhere. Um, so if I just kind of like walk around the block where there might not be

229
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,020
any pokey stops, I can still do something. So that's been a really good game for that.

230
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,940
Um, but I know a lot of people still play Pokemon go and I've played that too, because I might go

231
00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:01,180
to the park and play that, um, Ingress, um, that the, the play in that has slowed down tremendously

232
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,620
because most people are kind of staying in their own neighborhoods. So it's kind of one of those,

233
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:10,300
I like to go walking at one of the local parks, but like, if my competition hasn't taken it over

234
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:15,180
for their team, they don't go there as much as I do. So I oftentimes go there and I have nothing

235
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:20,380
to do because it's still, uh, my team's color. So, but they took it today. So I need to go,

236
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,380
uh, take care of that tomorrow, but we'll see. But yeah, I mean, that's been a good way to just

237
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:29,340
get out, get some sun and so forth is the nice, uh, GPS gaming. So there's that as well. Um,

238
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:35,900
and I know Pokemon go, especially has really been trying to, uh, rely on the incense. Um,

239
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,980
so you can really make more Pokemon spawn, even if you're just sitting in place. I know they did

240
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:45,500
a big event today. I checked it out for a little bit, but I wasn't going to sit there for six hours

241
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,380
playing that rating at home stuff yet. I don't think they've actually turned it on yet.

242
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,620
I know they've announced it, but it's not turned on yet, but I would imagine that's coming in the

243
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:59,500
next week. Uh, or very, very soon. I think before community day, cause community day is being

244
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:07,340
advertised with that new raid pass. Uh, and I got a new gym right nearby. So obviously I have to

245
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:13,180
keep it vague cause I don't like giving my address away on air, but I got a second gym added within

246
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:18,540
my site, what I can see from the house. So that will be like, um, something I can use, uh, cause

247
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:23,820
it says you can rate anything in your nearby view. So that's kind of nice. Oh, that's cool. Yeah.

248
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,140
So, um, I wonder if I can hit the, hit the one for my part. Um, you might as well, if, if it

249
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:33,420
comes up in your nearby, if like an egg is on it, then it's something you'll be able to remote raid.

250
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:38,300
That is apparently what the rules are supposed to be. Um, as to 200, Matt and chat says, I have

251
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,220
still been playing Pokemon go during this whole thing. I just play late at night when not a lot

252
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:46,780
of people are around. And that's 200. Matt says, I forgot about the event. I think that might also

253
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:51,660
tie into Pokemon goes kind of event fatigue. They've they're almost doing so many events.

254
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:56,140
It's hard to keep track of them sometimes. And some of them just fall off the radar. Like I've,

255
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:00,700
I've kind of given up on tracking all the Pokemon go events. Like I just play when I want to play.

256
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:06,700
They're clearly not increasing the level cap anytime soon. I'll catch them all eventually.

257
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,580
So I've kind of, I've kind of turned into filthy casual when it comes to Pokemon go. And that is

258
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:16,940
a okay. So, all right. Well, anyhow, I don't think I've touched it in a while to be honest.

259
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,180
Well, Hey, you know, if you start going for more walks that might that or order or so whatever's

260
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:25,180
up your alley might be the type of thing. That's just a kind of something that motivates you to

261
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:29,420
take a few more steps. You know what I mean? Yeah. I just saw that we unlocked falling King

262
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:34,140
Arthas, but apparently I can't bite him yet. Yeah. I doubt anybody. Yeah.

263
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:41,180
Well, that's doing that. Yeah. I'll be honest now though, when I'm walking or something like that,

264
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:47,180
I don't want to be distracted by looking at my phone when I'm trying to enjoy the scenery around

265
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:52,460
me. I'm just saying that's fair. Um, you know, I, I think you can find a blend of both. I try to

266
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,460
try to have a little bit of both, especially if I'm playing around sunset. Um, I find that the

267
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,220
phone can motivate me to kind of keep out there and then, Oh yeah. It's kind of look up once in

268
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:04,940
a while, you know, especially, um, if I'm well, you know, before the pandemic started, uh, when

269
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:09,340
I was playing Ingress in new areas, then it was very encouraging to kind of like, Oh, I never

270
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,860
would have thought this was here before. And you kind of stopped to check out, uh, that world

271
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:17,100
around you. So it's, um, kind of cool. So, all right. Kind of, I thought it would be interesting

272
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:21,580
to kind of hear about some of these fitness type of ways that were, you know, still staying fit in

273
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:27,020
this particular circumstance. Um, especially, uh, with this Beat Saber track, uh, having come out

274
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:31,580
this week specifically about fitness, let's move on though, and talk about, uh, the types of games

275
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,580
that we have been playing this week, whether they're fit or otherwise, and how was your gaming

276
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:40,060
week? So dark Sakura, how was your gaming week? What do you been playing? Animal crossing.

277
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:47,580
Of course. How's that going to be my gaming week for the next two years. Okay. Yeah. Um, really,

278
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:52,780
um, we finally, you know, got the KK things to the end of the storyline. I never say it's the

279
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:56,700
end of the game because the game is always ongoing. Dan still has the 2 million bell

280
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:04,540
loan to pay off for his basement. Now you're in the end game. Um, the animal crossing end game,

281
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:11,420
five star rating and the stonk market stonks. I actually did buy my first, uh,

282
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:17,980
Torps for actual doing a stock market. Well, you've got that whole little Facebook group

283
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:23,180
to share prices. And I've been added to two different Facebook groups for animal crossing.

284
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:29,020
Uh, there's yours. Yeah. And there's another one I got added to as well. And, uh, it's just,

285
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,940
it's great for checking up on turnip prices and stuff. So I wonder how long that's going to go.

286
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:37,420
Well, mine hasn't really died down at all in livelihood either.

287
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:41,180
And we know one of the other fun things about it is that, um,

288
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:48,300
it actually has been growing by more people. Like when I started this, I started it with 10 people

289
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,900
and I was like, Hey, you can add a friend here and there and a friend here and there turned into,

290
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,620
I don't know how many people we have in there. I'd have to go look at the statistics again,

291
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:05,740
but that group is just really growing. And if you're on, um, on Facebook, I do keep my Facebook

292
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:12,300
very, very hidden. Um, so if you're not, you know, a mutual or something, um, if you're a mutual

293
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:19,580
reach out, let me know. Um, if you find me on, uh, Twitter, I might be able to get you

294
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:24,620
away into the group. So we'll see, but the group is doing pretty well. Um, and everyone's been

295
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:29,100
really forthcoming. No one's like, Hey, I'm selling this for 50 million bells. You have

296
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:34,140
to pay it up or nothing. You need to leave a 50,000 bell tip and there will be a bodyguard

297
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:39,660
there amongst the fence path to collect. I can't stand that side of the game. I'm sorry. Those are

298
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:43,420
the types of groups I don't want to be in. You know, the only thing that I do, if it's an

299
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:50,140
absolute stranger, I'll do a limited code. And I got the idea from somebody of, um,

300
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:58,220
uh, putting, uh, a booth, like one of those little stands in front of, um, where the, uh,

301
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:04,620
airport is so that they can't get past it. Although I did wall off most of my, uh, village

302
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:10,860
because, um, and I'm not, you know, I'm not mad about it, but I've been more cautious that, um,

303
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:15,420
one of my friends, um, husband was playing on her account while she was, you know, tending to their,

304
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:23,340
their two-year-old. And, um, he came and shot down a bunch of my bamboo. Oh, yikes. Okay.

305
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:30,620
Cause I had, I had, um, cause the character in as a best friend. Yeah. Yeah. Or just,

306
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:34,540
you just the normal friend opening. But if you're someone's in with a dodo code, then they can dig

307
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,940
up your flowers and all of that. And I normally, you know, I'm fine with it. Usually I'm like,

308
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:43,500
Hey, look, I have extra of these blue pansies and I've got purple pansies now for the record.

309
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:49,180
Um, yeah, yeah. Go ahead and dig yourself up too. You know, and they chopped down. I mean,

310
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:54,460
thankfully I had sprouts. I could, you know, I could regrow the bamboo. It was fine. But I was

311
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:58,540
like, Hey, just talk to your husband and tell him that ain't cool. And she's like, Oh, he didn't

312
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:03,820
know any better. He's sorry. He says he's sorry. I'm like, okay. But still, I, I actually now I

313
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:09,980
have a, we call it our gated community. Um, and I'm finally getting my 10th villager, but I have

314
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:15,260
the way I have it laid out is the fences go, and they're really unobtrusive until you actually try

315
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:20,940
to leave, to go across the bridge. My river is, you know, four spaces wide now, you know,

316
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:27,580
at that cutoff point. So I've got pads that end. So, um, I've really, uh, you know, it's kind of

317
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:34,780
like how you can like at Disneyland, how they redo the chains to reform the Cuba reroute that I live

318
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:40,860
in Disneyland now. See, I just, I just wouldn't invite anyone. I didn't trust to not screw up my

319
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,460
town. Like, and you know, unless you put them on your best friends list, they can't, and you know,

320
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,620
you're not, you're just not going to be able to a hundred percent prevent the, like the, the husband

321
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,900
signing on the wife's account or whatever that whole thing, like, you're not going to be able to

322
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,780
a hundred percent stamp that out. Those types of issues are going to happen, but I just wouldn't

323
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:59,100
invite anyone in my town that I didn't trust to like, go to nooks, do your thing, please don't

324
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,460
run through the flowers, but if they run through flowers and they don't run through flowers,

325
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,700
but if they run through flowers and they grow back in two days, they're just going to irritate me.

326
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,460
Yeah. It doesn't destroy the flowers. Yeah. It's not like it wasn't the older games. Like,

327
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:14,460
as long as you don't add them to your best friends list, they're really limited on what they can do.

328
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:20,780
Well, the thing that I'm really doing is I'm trying to still encourage that open trade in the,

329
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:26,620
uh, in the community. So like today I walled off my sections and I stuck down my happy birthday

330
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,700
sign, which there'll be pictures up on my Instagram. That's, uh, double to no Shema,

331
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:38,620
uh, you know, double to underscore no underscore Shema. Um, and, uh, I, uh, you know, I had like

332
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:42,620
a little birthday party and everything that Agnes threw for me who I'm actually liking Agnes,

333
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:48,060
even though I call her a, you know, a bitch whenever I'm looking for. Um, but I had it to

334
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:54,300
where people could go visit my villagers. They can go to my stores, they could go in my museum,

335
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:58,700
you know, I can do little pictures and everything. I had my happy birthday sign it and a cake and

336
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:03,420
everything out. And I sat in the director's chair and, you know, and, you know, had a held

337
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:11,260
court PRI outfit. Cause it'll have enough bells for the crown. Um, and so, um, and you and Dan

338
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:16,780
and I last night, you know, we'll more like up to two in the morning. We, since I got terraforming,

339
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:21,420
we, you know, redid the grounds and we move things around and we just had a great time, you know,

340
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:26,380
it's been something, and I'm surprised that Dan has gotten as into it as he has. Um, but it's

341
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:31,100
something that he and I can do together. Um, and for the record, we do have a final fantasy

342
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:37,900
seven remake, but we haven't been so inclined to play it. Not yet. Interesting. Just cause you're

343
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:43,340
just so into animal crossing. Oh, that too. And it's just like, when we're not doing animal

344
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:47,740
crossing, we're watching our normal, you know, YouTube channels that we like to watch. Like we

345
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:54,060
like the, uh, the four levels of chef videos and we like the gourmet recreates videos and we like

346
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,420
binging with Babish. So you're just, you're just not in a rush to get to it. You'll get to it when

347
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:02,220
you get to it. Yeah. Retro core. That's another one. And we've also played a little bit of pinball

348
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:06,220
together. It's going to be two years before the next episode comes out anyway. So, I mean,

349
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:12,700
it's not a big deal. I don't think. No. Yeah. So yeah, we've got time. I'm cool with it. Cool.

350
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,020
All right. Well, um, by the way, I don't think you heard the end of Bobby's show because he was

351
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:21,580
telling a story, uh, that would have piqued your interest. Now I would encourage everybody to

352
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:25,420
listen to the Bobby Black Wolf show. Uh, but I will, I will summarize his story.

353
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:30,540
So Bobby has been trying to get one specific villager to come to his island and it's the

354
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:34,540
villager everybody wants. It's Oddie, right? The, the one named after the grandmother,

355
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:40,460
um, that played. So he's been using, um, Nook Miles tickets to go talk to, uh, all those,

356
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:44,700
you know, villagers that hang out on the island, right? Because when you have an open house,

357
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:49,900
uh, there will be villagers on the Nook Miles Island. Uh, like I just got boomer, uh, yesterday.

358
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,900
So I finally have a penguin in my town for the first time ever in all of my Animal Crossing

359
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:58,060
history. I finally have a fricking penguin in my town. Thank you very much. Um, but you can

360
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:02,460
talk to them and they'll, they'll move into the empty house if you want them to. Well, he went to

361
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:09,900
an island and he realized that he was fishing up nothing but garbage. He was on garbage Island and

362
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:15,900
Jamie, guess what villager was living on garbage Island? I think I know. Yeah. If you look to chat,

363
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:22,700
you probably know it was Ed. Ed, Ed lives on garbage Island. Ed is full of garbage.

364
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:28,940
I ran into Ed at somebody's, somebody else's, uh, town and I wish he'd been outside because

365
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:33,660
I would have beaten him to shit with a bug net or, or tried to ax him or something.

366
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:37,180
My friend that I visited the other day had Dina and I thought of you. Um,

367
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:41,660
she gave me a recipe. She was very nice. You know what? I have the card for Dina.

368
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:49,100
I'm getting a spare Dina of which when it arrives, I'm giving it to you. Oh, um,

369
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:54,700
I I've already given out my other spare cards except some of my specials,

370
00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:01,580
but I discovered something as well. I have one Sanrio card. I have the 12 card,

371
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:07,900
which is the, the, the little twin stars. And I got it because I wanted, um, I was going to do,

372
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:15,260
the, uh, amiibo thing on new leaf. Um, and I wanted a 12, you know, the little twin star set

373
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:20,860
and it never did it. And when I saw that you can use the little twin stars amiibo cards,

374
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:26,460
I was like, Oh shit. And I found where my card went. And so what happens is that if you've got

375
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:30,220
villagers that you want to summon from amiibo cards that you can't thumb and like,

376
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:34,780
you can't bring in at 12 and you can't do Digby or reset or any of those, you know,

377
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:42,460
when you still scan the amiibo card, you, when you get back on your, uh, your nook

378
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,700
kiosk thing, when you go into do a special order, you now have a place for posters.

379
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:52,140
Yep. So I have a little twin stars poster.

380
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,500
That's awesome. See, okay. We need to do a little amiibo trading that I don't know.

381
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,740
Maybe I have some figures you don't have. Cause I I'm obsessed with those little posters. I

382
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:03,100
have a room that has a bunch of them in it. Um, so I have like those little,

383
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:08,220
those little goats that are friends. I have them cause some of them form like super posters.

384
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:12,540
So you there there's, um, use the Tom Nook amiibo and then the Timmy and Tommy amiibo.

385
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,140
And it's three posters and they go together to form like a super poster.

386
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:20,380
It's really, I need to put it back in cause I have the Timmy and Nook and I need to rescan

387
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:28,700
my Nooklings for Tommy. Um, but right now, um, I have a reset poster in my house. I have a DJ

388
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:33,100
KK downstairs. I have, you know, my regular KK and I have my little, and it actually,

389
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:39,660
the little twin stars one is Timmy and Tommy as a Kiki Lala and Rob, I will absolutely order you

390
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:45,980
a poster tomorrow. Um, I think I used up my, my orders, but I'm also willing to say that if any

391
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:54,220
of our listeners, you know, if you want a Kiki Lala poster over, I'll say the next two weeks,

392
00:33:54,220 --> 00:34:01,980
I will give out four of them and you have to message me on Twitter and we'll, we'll work out

393
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:08,220
the code or the dodo code or whatever. And you can't give out that code to anybody, but I will,

394
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:13,500
I will make sure that you get a Kiki Lala poster or one of Timmy and Tommy is Kiki Lala.

395
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:19,660
Fun. All right. All right. Well, let's move on. I think we've talked a lot of animal crossing,

396
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:23,500
but I know it's, it's, it's not enough. You can't get away from it. It's everywhere.

397
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,860
Anyway. Uh, Loki, maybe, maybe your week was filled with animal crossing too. I don't know.

398
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:31,020
How was your gaming week? No, I have still not touched animal crossing, unfortunately,

399
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:35,980
even though I have it. Um, no, this week was pretty much just step mania. I've been,

400
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:42,060
you know, still trying to curate my, uh, song list and keep adding to it. They have too many

401
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:46,940
songs in there. And so right now, mainly just trying to get the repeats out of there and,

402
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:53,580
um, trying to take out stuff that's just ridiculously, like irritating or just,

403
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:59,100
you know, uh, the steps are ridiculous on them. Um, cause going through his stuff,

404
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:03,660
there's a lot of, I know like folks love doing like step files for anime music. And

405
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:12,780
I mean, it's fine, but like when you have like 500 songs of like various anime tracks

406
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:18,940
for animes I've never seen, like that's too much or like even like hardcore techno or,

407
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:24,620
and you, uh, rave music and stuff. It's like, okay. It's just so much of it just sounds the

408
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:31,260
same. Like I need to whittle down some of that stuff so that it's not so crazy. Um,

409
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:37,980
so yeah, so I've been doing that, um, and actually playing some of it as well. Um,

410
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:44,220
and then aside from step mania, I've been playing a little bit of stuff on my PC. So I played

411
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:49,500
Minecraft this week as well. Uh, we were playing with my kids this morning and so I have a realm,

412
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:55,580
it's kind of like a server, um, that we all play as a family. And so they wanted to go

413
00:35:55,580 --> 00:36:00,380
kill the other dragon. So we found the, uh, fortress and, or I'm sorry. Yeah,

414
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:05,580
I think it's a stronghold. And we went to the end and, uh, killed the under dragon as a family.

415
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:10,540
So that was kind of fun. And then, uh, what else? Uh, look played a little bit of earth

416
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:16,780
defense force, iron rain, uh, because I picked that up on a steam sale at some point. And so,

417
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:21,820
uh, of course, you know, I love my earth defense force games and that one's kind of ridiculous as

418
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:26,940
well, but it's, it's a fancier looking earth defense force. So, um, I like that. The only

419
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:31,660
thing I didn't quite care for is a lot of those games are kind of shoddily put together. So

420
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:39,340
for whatever reason, it like, it really wants to play on my laptop monitor, which I have two

421
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:44,540
dedicated monitors, you know, at my desk and it's just trying to play on the side here.

422
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:49,020
So I have to disable my laptop, uh, display in order for it to play on the right screen,

423
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:55,180
which is stupid. Absolutely dumb, but it's earth defense force. So what are you going to do?

424
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:00,140
So that's pretty much it. All right. Sounds like you've had a pretty, pretty busy week.

425
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:04,140
I love that story of killing the ender dragon as a family. That's adorable.

426
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:09,100
Uh, some people play board games, your family kills dragons. That's cool. Uh, so, uh, my gaming

427
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:13,180
week. So yeah, I've had some time to play video games. Um, so I'm still playing a lot of final

428
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:18,140
fantasy 14, cause that's my MMO time seek of choice. Um, and I've also been playing animal

429
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:22,700
crossing, just like dark Sakura, probably not as much as star Sakura. Although I also,

430
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:27,180
today was my KK to concert actually this morning when I signed in to get the turnips,

431
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:31,340
I got the KK concert, which is when the credits roll. So does that mean I beat animal crossing?

432
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:35,180
Can I count that as IB animal crossing for the year? Cause you finished the storyline.

433
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,780
Okay. Like, like you were saying, you're now in end game. I'm in the end game now. Yeah,

434
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:41,980
no, but I I've been, uh, I've been getting a little more into the gardening thing. So I'm

435
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:46,380
starting to collect the flowers. Like you brought me like blue pansies, I think. And so I've been

436
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:50,300
trying to set up those efficient cross breeding gardens. You've probably seen some of the pictures

437
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:55,420
floating around out there. Um, so, and I, I have a cute little area. I've been really into

438
00:37:55,420 --> 00:38:00,540
customizing the things I build. Like I did not realize like, Oh, not only can you build a

439
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,900
fountain, but you can paint it black. And I was like, Ooh, so I set up this whole little like

440
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,900
garden and I love it. So, um, yeah, you'll have to, you'll have to come see what I did dark Sakura.

441
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:12,060
Cause I kind of changed a lot in that. And I finally got able sisters, which I know you

442
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:18,460
were looking for last time. So, uh, that is there. Hey, if, if during your lunch tomorrow, cause I,

443
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:22,380
I had already taken two days off for my birthday because I was supposed to be in San Francisco,

444
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:31,260
but no disease. Thank you dump anyway. Um, but, um, tomorrow we'll have to, um, to do some cross

445
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:35,500
visiting so that we can see each other's new changes. Cause like I said, I've done a lot of

446
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:40,060
work in my town. Yeah. So, and then I built himself a redneck paradise. I just unlocked

447
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:45,180
all that terraforming. So now, and now I'm, I had like 40,000 miles in storage cause I never go to

448
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:49,100
the islands. So like, I'm like, Oh, I'm buying that. I'm buying that. I'm buying that. So yeah,

449
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:54,460
you'll have to see anyway. Um, I also, I keep thinking I'm going to do a stream on my personal

450
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:58,860
channel and I will get to it. Here's what's kind of been slowing me down on streaming on my

451
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:05,660
personal channel. I've actually had to use some of the equipment to set up my work stuff on my,

452
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:11,020
in my personal office. Some of like the splitters and HDMI cables and stuff are actually making me

453
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:15,260
able to work in my office. So if you're wondering like why I haven't streamed in a long time,

454
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:19,020
that is a big part of the reason, but I need to just fix all that. Cause I really want to do

455
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:23,500
like a stream where I visit people's animal crossing towns, uh, and, uh, hit their villagers

456
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:29,100
with bug nets. No, I'm kidding. I'll be respectful. It'd be fun. So, uh, yeah. Um, there's that. So,

457
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:34,060
uh, I, I've been making progress in animal crossing, which is cool. I've also been playing

458
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:40,620
a crap ton of final fantasy seven remake. Still haven't beaten it yet, but I'm at least 20 hours

459
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:49,660
in I'm thinking beyond that. And I am in chapter 13, 14, maybe I don't, I just opened up a lot of

460
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:54,780
sub quests and that is probably what I can say without spoiling. Cause obviously I'm not going

461
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:59,420
to be that guy who spoils, uh, how can you spoil a game that is so many years old and just being

462
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:04,460
remade because, and I said this last week and I'll say it again because not enough people understand

463
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:11,820
this final fantasy seven remake is not the same story. I mean, it kinda, it's the same plot.

464
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:17,660
It's the same characters, but they've changed quite a bit. And so if you're again going,

465
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:22,380
well, I'm not going to play a game. That's only a quarter of the experience. You're wrong.

466
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:28,140
It's it's it's you're, you're thinking of it, not the right, you're not putting it in the right

467
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:35,100
framing because it's not a one for one remake of the original whatsoever. It is completely a new,

468
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,540
uh, plot because they have fleshed things out and all that good stuff are really good.

469
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:43,100
So I was making comparisons on last week's show and a really good one came up on Bobby

470
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:47,420
Black Wolf show from pod culture. And I think this is the best comparison I've heard yet.

471
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:54,380
It's the battle star Galactica 70 series and the battle star Galactica reboot series.

472
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:59,420
They're different. There's a lot of similarities, a lot, a lot of similar characters, a lot of

473
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:04,140
things, but a lot's changed for one. The special effects are much better in the newer version.

474
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:10,700
So I think that was a really, really good, um, comparison. Um, Tiger claw and chat says,

475
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:15,820
does a certain character meet the same fate? Um, I don't know yet because it has not been addressed

476
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:20,780
in the story. And even if I did know, I was not, I would never spoil for the listeners and, uh,

477
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:25,260
we'll, we'll, we'll find out, uh, play the game and find out. And maybe in six months,

478
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:29,340
we can talk a little more openly about it when, uh, enough people have played it at this point.

479
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:36,300
Um, let's see, um, going to chat for some other comments, uh, Phoenix 77 26 says,

480
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:40,460
I wonder if they will make certain decisions in that game again, or if certain party members will

481
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:45,100
stay until the end, Rob, I don't know. It depends. It depends. I don't know what they're going to do

482
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:50,700
for the future episodes. Um, because there's really only four playable characters in this game.

483
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:55,340
Um, and so I don't know what's going to happen when you open up things like Vincent Yuffie and,

484
00:41:55,340 --> 00:42:00,300
uh, Sid and like all the characters you get later on. Oh yeah. And that was, that was the thing too,

485
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:07,820
is member. You could also get you earlier in the game, um, in Midgar actually in the original that

486
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:14,940
is rare to do that, but you could do it. Yeah. So I, the answer, the answer is I don't know. And I,

487
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:20,780
again, I think it is incorrect to assume because anything happened in the original,

488
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:25,020
it's going to happen the same way in this one. This game makes it very clear. They're not going

489
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:30,300
to follow the exact same script. Um, so they're going to do their own thing. So we, we, we really

490
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,140
don't know. So what's going to happen in that department. Uh, maybe there'll be new characters

491
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:41,500
you can play. Who knows? Um, I, uh, what, what, Oh, I will say this. So, um, they've said openly,

492
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:49,020
you know, you know, you can play Aerith Barrett, uh, Tifa cloud, and then red 13 is there,

493
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:53,820
but you, he's a guest character. They've said that in pre-release interviews. I'm not like spoiling

494
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:58,060
anything. They haven't talked about openly the official staff before the game came out. It's

495
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:02,860
pretty limited to those characters. However, another character, and this is the part I am

496
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:07,660
going to leave vague, did show up in a cut scene. And I was like, like, I was like, I,

497
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:12,140
I was not expecting to see that. And it was, it was, it was like a blink and you'll miss it thing.

498
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:18,300
And I was like, that's, that's, and that was it. So, uh, there's, and I don't think in the

499
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:23,580
original, the character was in the Midgar part of the story. So I'm there's again,

500
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:29,900
they're doing their own thing and I think it's great. So, um, Phoenix 77 26 says, Rob,

501
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,580
do we know when the next episode is coming out? No, we don't. And we don't even know if they're

502
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:40,380
calling it an episode. They're going to do their own thing and that's fine. So, um, anyhow, so

503
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:45,900
that's enough on Final Fantasy 7 Remake. I'm, I'm still loving it. Um, oh no, I should say one other

504
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:50,460
thing because I think now some things where I could see like some criticisms of the game,

505
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:58,540
um, not so much the story, but I did notice in playing chapters 10 and 11, some of it started

506
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:03,100
to feel, and Alan was actually watching me play because, um, Alan wanted to see a certain sequence

507
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:07,660
that happened in the game. And then it led into chapters 10 and 11. And even he had kind of

508
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:11,500
commented like, this is getting to be a little like these maps are getting a little long. Like

509
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:16,220
these, this is getting a little samey what you're doing. And I would say it was starting to get

510
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:20,700
luckily the game picked up again, but it was starting to feel a little bit grindy and a little

511
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:25,580
bit like, okay, this is getting a little like, yeah. Um, and then the other thing I think is

512
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:29,180
that really needs to be brought up about Final Fantasy 7 Remake is that

513
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:34,940
a lot of people that are praising Final Fantasy 7 Remake, and I'm not saying Final Fantasy 7 Remake

514
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:39,900
isn't deserving of lots of praise. I'm praising it. It's a great game, but it is fascinating to

515
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:46,860
me. How many people are praising 7 Remake who completely took a shit on Final Fantasy 13?

516
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:55,020
Because I'm gonna tell you what, Final Fantasy 7 Remake almost has just as much in common

517
00:44:55,020 --> 00:45:02,380
with Final Fantasy 13 as it does with Final Fantasy 7. You'll see what I mean when you get

518
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:08,860
around to playing it. But part of it is some of the maps do get kind of linear, except you might

519
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:13,420
have a little branching path that takes you to a treasure chest. But like, I'm kind of surprised.

520
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:19,660
And again, it didn't bother me in 13, because I still felt like there was enough like progression.

521
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:22,860
There was enough where it kind of fit the narrative and the story they were trying to tell

522
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:28,860
like the the linearity in Final Fantasy 13 didn't really bother me. But I want to be clear,

523
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:35,100
it's no better in Final Fantasy 7 Remake. So it's interesting to me how people that were really

524
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:40,620
bothered by... I really think if you play Final Fantasy 7 Remake and you finish it and all that

525
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:45,980
stuff, you should go back and play Final Fantasy 13 and reevaluate some of your feelings on Final

526
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:51,660
Fantasy 13. Because I think that game, I think time will treat that game more favorably than

527
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:55,980
what it got when it first came out. I think as people go back and play it again. That whole

528
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:02,540
stagger mechanic that's in Final Fantasy 7 Remake, guess what game that came from? 13. So, you know,

529
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:07,420
put some put some respect on Final Fantasy 13's name. That's what I'm saying. And what a perfect

530
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:12,620
time to re-release the trilogy, although I don't think Square Enix has any plans to. But if I

531
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:20,940
remember right, at the end of last year, Microsoft said at least 13 would be coming to Game Pass at

532
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:25,020
some point. I don't know about 13 to enlightening returns. I can't recall if that was included.

533
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:31,180
But we should be seeing at some point 13 hit Microsoft Game Pass. So if you happen to have

534
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:36,780
that, what a great opportunity to revisit, hopefully coming soon. I don't know. We'll see.

535
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:42,300
So some comments in chat because I knew my hot take would get some comments here in chat.

536
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:48,540
Bobby Blackwell says, it's very corridor heavy. I enjoyed 13. Akuma JP says, nope, Rob, you're

537
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:54,940
wrong. How dare you? Final Fantasy 13 has shitty story. Final Fantasy 13 battle is shitty without

538
00:46:54,940 --> 00:47:00,220
materia. Final Fantasy 13 has shitty dialogue. Final Fantasy 13 says has shitty character

539
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:06,860
except lightning. But Final Fantasy 13 also has a decent ending. And I don't know if I

540
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:11,820
necessarily agree. I enjoyed the battles, to be honest. I don't. Yeah. So anyway.

541
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:18,780
VG Realness says, I never understood why people complain about Final Fantasy games being linear.

542
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:24,300
They always were. I know I personally dislike 13 for other reasons. And that's fine. Again,

543
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:29,820
people can have their own opinions on games. It's fine. But it's just interesting to me sometimes

544
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:34,460
how the criteria here doesn't match the criteria here all the time. But that's fine. If you didn't

545
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:39,500
like the story and you didn't like the characters, I don't think I can like change your mind on that.

546
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:44,380
That's just one of those things that's open to interpretation like any movie or book or what

547
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:47,820
have you. It's just going to click for some people. It's not going to click for other people.

548
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:53,820
And I will say Final Fantasy 13 did get a little alphabet soupy with some of their,

549
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:59,980
like the lacy and the falcie. And it did get a little, okay, I'll give you that. It got a

550
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:06,540
little crazy with all that stuff. So it's fine. VG Realness says, I mean, name a Final Fantasy

551
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:13,180
game prior to 15 that was not linear. 14 and 11, the MMOs. Okay. If I can't count those though,

552
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:16,380
yeah, no. I mean, even go back to the very first Final Fantasy. You're right.

553
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:22,380
A lot of that game's design is very gated. It's like you have this part of the map and then you're

554
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,740
going to go to this dungeon and get the dynamite that opens this part of the map. And then you're

555
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:29,100
going to go to this dungeon and get the canoe that opens this part of the map. And then you're going

556
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:32,060
to go get the boat that opens this part of the map. And then the airship that opens this part

557
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:35,740
of that. You're right. Final Fantasy games have kind of been linear in design for a very long

558
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:43,660
time. So VG Realness says about the MMOs, they don't count. Don't get cute. I can't help it.

559
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:48,700
I was born cute. All right. That's enough of my gaming week. Uh, let's talk about some other stuff

560
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:54,060
like what's going on in the news. So, uh, Loki, if you didn't fall asleep during my rants,

561
00:48:54,060 --> 00:49:00,300
why don't you start us off with some gaming news? Um, so like this isn't a really big surprise,

562
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:04,860
but apparently, uh, Sony is, they're saying they're going to be making fewer PlayStation

563
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:12,140
fives this year. Um, due to its price, basically, um, you know, the thought is that a lot of these

564
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:16,060
consoles might be a little bit behind in production because of the whole COVID-19 thing

565
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:20,460
and folks not being able to return to work and that kind of stuff. But apparently they're saying

566
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:28,700
that, um, they're expecting that the pricing of course is going to be a factor in, um, not being

567
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:32,940
able to manufacture these units. I'm guessing maybe because the longer that they wait or because

568
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:37,660
production right now is impacted by that, there's high prices for that stuff. We don't even really

569
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:43,100
know what the price of the console is going to be yet, but we'll have to see. Um, right now they're

570
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:47,820
been telling their partners that they're going to make between five to 6 million PlayStation fives

571
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:53,980
during the financial year, which is, I mean, uh, March 31st of next year. And apparently they've

572
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:59,020
sold of course more than that for like PlayStation three and four and stuff within the first two

573
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:07,820
quarters. So, um, I don't know. I mean, I think a lot of these stories seem to be just, let's

574
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:12,860
speculate on stuff because we got nothing to go with. Cause it's slow. No, I think there is

575
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:17,020
definitely some of that coming into play, but I think, I think like, I think people are already

576
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:22,460
concerned about how might the COVID situation and how it impacts the various factories and all

577
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:26,460
these different countries that produce products. How is that going to ultimately play out in the

578
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:30,940
situation? But I think it's interesting about this. Um, buzz, if you, I don't know what else

579
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:35,500
to call it a rumors, you know, what have you, uh, admittedly, uh, what's interesting about it is

580
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:39,180
that they aren't really blaming the COVID situation, but they're saying because these,

581
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:43,820
these parts are still very expensive and they're not projected to come down in price for a little

582
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:49,420
bit. Uh, Sony is like, kind of like purposefully making less of it. So that way it doesn't feel

583
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:53,500
like they're like, like the store shelves are full of them and it's not selling well, I guess

584
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,540
that's kind of what I'm reading. I don't think it's necessarily that they're saying that

585
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:00,620
basically certain components are scarce and expensive, which would cut into the company's

586
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:06,460
profits. So they're basically holding back on producing a large number of these right now,

587
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:12,300
while the component pricing is high and waiting to produce more, once all that stuff settles down

588
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:16,780
and everybody's back to work and then all the pricing will come down. Yeah. And I was to say

589
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:21,340
that would make more sense is that during this COVID situation, like, you know, technology gets

590
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:25,420
cheaper and cheaper and cheaper is the usual trajectory. Right. But during this situation,

591
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:30,060
that's probably not happening. And so maybe that's kind of throwing off Sony's patterns as to

592
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:33,820
how much money are we going to make off this console and when, and all that stuff,

593
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:38,140
um, as Joanna. No, go ahead. I was going to say, and we have to even see when it's going to come

594
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:43,180
out because right now we're targeting the end of the year, but I mean, there's no, that's not set

595
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:48,780
in stone. So we'll have to see. Absolutely. I mean, depending on how this whole COVID stuff

596
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:54,140
plays out, which we just don't know, you know, especially if the recent wave of, you know,

597
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:58,700
and again, I'm, I'm really trying not to go there on the show, but this, it is the reality and could

598
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:03,740
have an effect on games and stuff. But if this recent wave of people clearly not giving a fuck

599
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:09,260
anymore and just wanting to go out in mass and like, you know, I would rather make money, uh,

600
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:16,300
for my boss than, uh, be healthy and all this stuff. If this plays into this situation,

601
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:21,820
just getting drawn out longer, uh, because a second wave ends up happening, like what happened,

602
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:29,020
uh, in the 19 hundreds with that flu pandemic, um, then maybe we're not going to see this end

603
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:33,260
by September or October, which is when you would expect a new console to come out.

604
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:37,980
Well, also something to add with that too. I'm glad that you brought that up because with these,

605
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:45,340
uh, I'm just going to say it with these absolute idiots. I hate using the word, but they're

606
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:52,220
idiots. Um, people who are trying to protest about going back to work, um, they don't seem to realize

607
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:57,500
that yes, in 1918, when they, uh, during the height of the Spanish flu, when, um, after the

608
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:02,220
end of world war, world war one, yeah. When, um, you know, the rates were going down, people were

609
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:07,740
getting better. The moment they had a big massive celebration for the end of world war one,

610
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:13,260
guess what happened? The pandemic spiked even higher than it did before resulting in,

611
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:19,100
I would, I think it was like another 20% more deaths than the first spike had cost.

612
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:26,220
Yeah. And it's just, I, I, I understand, like, I understand the frustrations where people like,

613
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:30,540
you know, are like, they're not able to work right now, you know, especially in people that are in

614
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:35,740
like the bar industry or the entertainment or the, you know, um, live concert type of experience

615
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:39,980
stuff. Uh, you know, these people are not able to work right now and I understand those frustrations,

616
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:44,620
but at the same time, I don't, for me, and I guess now this is a political issue,

617
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:50,780
which is so weird to think, cause I didn't think this should be, but clearly, but like,

618
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:54,300
instead of begging to go back to work and expose all these people to this,

619
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:59,180
why aren't we protesting that the government should be providing for us?

620
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:03,420
Exactly. Well, and that should be the protest, shouldn't it? I don't know. This is weird.

621
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,340
One thing that I tried to tell my mom too, is she's like, Oh, you know,

622
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:11,340
she's one of those good old days, kind of, Oh, the fifties, blah, blah, blah, you know?

623
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:17,180
And she doesn't like when I point out to her the tax rates that we were, that, that America

624
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:23,500
in general had in the fifties and that we were coming right out of FDR's new deal. He's like,

625
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:28,140
Oh, but, but the last two months, you can't say that you want things to go back to the

626
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:34,940
prosperity that we had before yet vote against the things that made us have that prosperity before.

627
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:40,060
Yeah. You cut out there. Did you have anything else?

628
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:41,660
Um, no.

629
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:46,140
Okay. Sorry. Um, so, um, anyway, I, sorry, I didn't mean to get tangenty,

630
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:49,500
but it's going to happen with everything that's going on in the world. Sorry. But I mean,

631
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:55,340
and like I said, it could affect all of this because if we, if we do not succeed in eradicating

632
00:54:55,340 --> 00:55:00,700
this or minimizing it to a traceable testable thing that's controlled, let's say, uh, within

633
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:04,940
the next couple of months, then we could be looking at things in the fall, get pushed back

634
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:08,860
to, and we don't get new game consoles because you know, companies don't want to risk that type

635
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:12,940
of financial state or whatever. Um, because that should not be the type of stuff that we're rushing

636
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:18,220
to target to get. Uh, as somebody is pointing out in chat, Phoenix 77 26 says, I get those,

637
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:22,140
but then you have asses whining about how they can't get fertilizer for their hobby garden,

638
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:26,300
or can't get their hair cut or some ass, nine shit like that. And that's, that's the thing is

639
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:32,380
that, you know, essential means essential, right? So, um, video game consoles, I'm sorry,

640
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:37,820
they're not, they're not essential. You probably have a gigantic backlog of games on steam and so

641
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:42,300
forth. Um, or you know what, let me, let me introduce you to a fantastic website. It's called

642
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:51,500
itch.io and games as far as the eye can see low cost and free that will keep you busy for the next

643
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:58,540
10 years if you want it to, uh, even that might remind everybody that Ludum Dari is this weekend

644
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:02,700
as well. There is going to be literally hundreds of games available for you to play. And plus all

645
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:07,740
those other game jam games from previous tons of game jams all the time, free games all around.

646
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:13,820
Yeah. So we don't, we don't need a PlayStation five this year. Sure. It would be nice as a

647
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:19,340
gaming fan. I would welcome that, but I understand there's a lot of crazy shit going on in the world

648
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:24,860
right now. And if the PlayStation five doesn't happen as a result this year, I'll be okay. I,

649
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:32,860
I got food and water. I'll be okay. So it's yeah. Anyway, we'll see, we'll see what happens though,

650
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:39,260
as, um, you know, the, the, the weeks and so forth continue. And, uh, especially if Sony is kind of

651
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:43,820
running up against the clock to maybe announce some of this stuff, a lot of folks expecting

652
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:49,420
that Sony would announce things in a June timeframe because June would have been E3.

653
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:54,620
June is typically the month when these things are unveiled. Although I suppose if Sony shown

654
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:58,540
anything in the past couple of years, it is that they're going to do whatever the fuck they want

655
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:04,460
and they're going to do it on their timetable. So, um, do we expect a Loki or dark side? Do we

656
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:08,620
expect Sony to make an announcement in June or, or do we think that doesn't even happen at this

657
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:13,900
point? Um, it, I think it's going to happen at some point they're going to have some sort of

658
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:18,540
announcements, but yeah, a lot of these, they don't really seem to have much of a digital

659
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:25,500
plan for, um, well, aside from what IGN is supposed to be doing for that, but like,

660
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,340
there's not really anything been announced yet for that. And I don't know if they're in a big

661
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:36,220
hurry to do that. Um, I don't know. I hope we get some announcements. I think it would

662
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:41,180
behoove them though, to try to keep some kind of hype running, you know,

663
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:44,940
I think that's also why we are getting a little bit, we are getting kind of like the drip feed

664
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:50,060
of like, for example, we had that Mark Cerny, uh, game developer conference, uh, clearly crafted

665
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:55,980
presentation that came out. We just had a game that's getting up, up dude for PlayStation five,

666
00:57:55,980 --> 00:58:00,220
had a trailer come out this week. And, uh, so it's showing off a little bit of what the PlayStation

667
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:04,940
five can do. Uh, that was available. So I, I do feel like they're still going to kind of like

668
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:09,580
drip feed us little bits and pieces here and there, but as for the big unveil, who knows?

669
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:14,300
And I think SGL 100 Matt has an excellent point in chat. It's kind of bad timing to announce a

670
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:19,740
price for things when people are struggling to pay rent. I don't even know if June is the time,

671
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:24,700
like Loki is saying they don't need to rush. And that's a very good point as well is that, um,

672
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:31,900
it might be kind of tacky of Sony to announce something like that until we have a solution for,

673
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:38,540
you know, when will things start to get back to some sense of normalcy and when will

674
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:42,220
the majority of people be able to go back to work and some of those things get answered?

675
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:46,540
I don't know. Um, I would hope by June, we're starting to get to some of those questions, but

676
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:50,380
I will listen to the West coast governors on that because they're listening to scientists.

677
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:57,580
So I don't think normal is going to exist. Well, that's why I said some sense of normal.

678
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:02,620
This is the new normal. I really think this is it. This is the new normal.

679
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:05,340
I don't think shelter in place is the normal forever.

680
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:11,100
I think some things are going to be different, but I, and like mass gatherings may still be

681
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:15,980
impacted for a while. I think conventions and Disneyland and those sorts of things could be,

682
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:21,260
uh, on hold for a lot longer. But I think, I mean, it just, it all depends on the testing.

683
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:25,500
It depends on the testing and tracking. That's what it boils down to. Uh, listen to those, uh,

684
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:30,860
six points that the governor laid out previously. I think they will start to open restaurants and,

685
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:34,940
you know, allow you to go visit friends and things like that, but it's going to be situations where

686
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:40,780
the contacts are traceable when it comes down to, but anyway, um, yeah, I agree with Bobby.

687
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:45,420
There's no way we're going to shelter in place until fall of 2021. I just, that's not what I

688
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:52,860
meant. Okay. I mean that it's the taking extra precautions, having more social, um, windfalls,

689
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:56,540
especially here in California. I think that they're really going to, I honestly think that

690
00:59:56,540 --> 01:00:02,540
we're going to get a, uh, quite a bit more of a, uh, a socialist turn in some of this because we

691
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:07,740
are enacting more and more policies now to protect people who have no means of,

692
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:12,460
of their livelihood anymore. And I think we're going to start to see things like, um,

693
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:17,580
a little bit more involvement and hopefully on a national scale, I'd really like for us to see

694
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:25,580
more of a, uh, what's the word I'm thinking of more, um, foresight more, um, uh, gosh,

695
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:29,980
I can't think of the word right now when you're, um, when you're ahead of the curve, you know,

696
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:36,860
for when you're prepared. Yeah. Yeah. Not the word I was thinking of, but it's kind of like that

697
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:42,620
anyway, but that's, um, I'm having word problems. Um, but I think that we're hopefully that we're

698
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:46,700
going to see, we're going to actually learn from this. I mean, not with, of course,

699
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:52,380
the current administration, but I also think that we might, there's going to be a big turn against

700
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:58,540
that kind of backwards thought. We're going to start seeing people look more appreciatively at

701
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:03,020
those who provide the services of, of, of our country. I really do hope so. That's what I'm

702
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:09,100
thinking is going to be the new normal. Oops, I hit my button by accident. Um, the new normal

703
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:15,500
is going to be that we, we also hopefully we'll do a lot more for each other and live more frugally

704
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:20,300
that we're not going to be as we need, need, need, need, need all of this stuff.

705
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:25,260
When we know that it's not a need, it's a want, and we have bigger things that we need to be

706
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:30,540
worrying about just saying, and this is me as a gamer saying this. Yeah. So that made sense.

707
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:35,020
Yeah, no, I get it. I get it. Anyway, I'm trying again, it's, it's hard for the subject not to come

708
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:39,500
up, but I mean, it is impacting the video games that we're talking about. And, you know, I think

709
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:44,300
a lot of these expectations as gamers of, Oh, things are announced in June and dah, dah, dah,

710
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:47,820
like this is all up in the air due to this situation, which you just kind of like have

711
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:54,300
to understand, um, you know, that, that if anything is the new normal, it's uncertainty

712
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:58,540
and uncertainty is that normal, you know, so not everything is necessarily going to go

713
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:05,500
according to a whatever, whatever type of plan. Um, also I think worth pointing out,

714
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:11,740
remember the Nintendo switch, Nintendo switch, what they announced that in early January.

715
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:15,740
And it locked cause it was right after new year's day. It was around like January

716
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:20,220
seventh or so they announced that. And then it launched in what, like early March.

717
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:26,300
So not even like two months between announcement and launch and the Nintendo switch has done very,

718
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:33,340
very well. So there's nothing to say that Sony couldn't announce in September and then launch

719
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:37,500
it in November, two months be plenty of time for them. I don't know if that's what the investors

720
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:45,420
would like, but they could do it could happen. We'll see anyhow. All right, let's move on,

721
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:52,940
get into some other topics. Uh, let's talk about Facebook, uh, which I know, I know in some ways

722
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:57,340
I'm like, I'd rather not, because if you want to talk about where a lot of this misinformation

723
01:02:57,340 --> 01:03:02,700
and people going crazy and, and 5g caused this and all this stuff, I mean, look at Facebook,

724
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:08,060
like where does, where does all that BS said about that, Rob, about, about certain technologies

725
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:14,460
causing problems like this. Um, electricity. Yeah. Anyway, it's silly. We all, I think anybody

726
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:19,180
listening to this show on a cell phone connection probably knows that that's talk is silly, but

727
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:23,500
people, people spread it. People spread things and Facebook is one thing they used to do it,

728
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:30,460
but I guess we get Facebook to spread the rumors that like loop boxes cause COVID-19.

729
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:34,700
I don't know. At least that's a positive, you know, like we can get rid of loot boxes at the

730
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:39,500
same time. We need those clickbait articles. I don't know, but, uh, maybe Facebook doesn't

731
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:44,300
want to be known as the capital of misinformation anymore. And they want to be known as a gaming

732
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:50,060
site. So Facebook is going to be releasing their own gaming mobile app this week. Supposedly it

733
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:55,740
launches on April 20th. Uh, so meaning Monday tomorrow. So we'll see. Uh, I don't know if it

734
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:59,980
will, but that's the date they're targeting. I can't wait for all of the apps to shove that

735
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:04,620
down my throat. Yeah. Right. Uh, there will be, uh, some casual games built into the app

736
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:09,980
that you can play, but you can also watch and create gaming live streams because Facebook

737
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:15,020
is trying to go after that audience with the Twitch and the YouTube and all that. They are

738
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:20,300
saying that the apple initially be available for Android. They are simply waiting on the iOS, uh,

739
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:26,860
apple approval type of a situation for, uh, that side of things. Maybe, maybe they won't. I don't

740
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:32,220
know. I think it will go through, but anyway, uh, doesn't talk about how broadcasting is going to

741
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:38,540
work on the apple devices. Um, that could be interesting, but I think stream labs works,

742
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:46,140
so I'm sure it's possible, but we'll see. Um, honestly, I'm not ready to really sign on to

743
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:51,340
Facebook gaming. I think before Facebook tries to, this is a personal opinion. I think before

744
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:56,140
Facebook tries to put its hand in all these other cookie jars, they need to fix the jar they're in

745
01:04:56,140 --> 01:05:00,780
and the spreading of misinformation is that jar that needs to be fixed. Sure. I think I heard

746
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:06,140
they made it so that if you like an article that has misinformation about COVID-19, a pop-up comes

747
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:14,220
up. Um, that's a start, a really small delayed late after the fact start, but here, you know,

748
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:21,980
have a, have a cookie, you know, you did that now do more. Um, so we'll see, but in the meantime,

749
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:26,380
I'm not interested in their gaming app whatsoever. Um, but maybe some of you are and you know what,

750
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:30,220
who knows, maybe it really will be the next big thing and I'm completely underestimating it,

751
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:36,380
but I am a-okay with Twitch in the meantime. And Mixer's pretty cool too. Uh, and, uh, yeah,

752
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:40,620
I'll leave it at that. So if we don't have any other comments on that, let's go over to, um,

753
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:45,100
Dark Soccer with a bit of, um, kind of sad news. Bummers. Yeah. Lots of bummers. Sorry. Lots of

754
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:52,380
bummers, but. So we have, uh, lost some people in the gaming industry and I, I'm always like,

755
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:57,420
I read these articles. So-and-so has died. I'm like, that's very passive. They just died.

756
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:02,380
So-and-so died. Just say it, you know, I hate the, the passive, make it gentle thing. I want it

757
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:09,580
final, you know? But anyway, um, uh, among those lost was Rick May, who was the, uh, one of the

758
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:17,820
voice actors in Star Fox 64. He was Peppy, Peppy Hare and Andross, you know, bad guy. Um, he also

759
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:24,140
was, uh, the soldier in Team Fortress 2 and the narrator and voice of Genghis Khan in, uh, Age

760
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:33,340
of Empires 2. He's done movie work. He was a teacher. Um, so, uh, you know, the community has

761
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:39,340
suffered a, a loss, uh, with the hold that he's left. Um, another, you know, big name, um, a lot

762
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:46,060
that we know, um, it was Paul Haddad who was the, uh, voice of Leon in the original release of

763
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:52,940
Resident Evil 2 or Biohazard. Um, you know, and again, he had done, uh, some other movie work.

764
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:58,860
Um, he's done some animated work in the 1990s. X-Men, he was Quicksilver. So, um, he was also

765
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:04,060
like the Adventures of Tintin and Babar, you know, a lot, you know, classic video game,

766
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:08,780
video game and, uh, animation voice actor. And again, another, another hole is left.

767
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:16,220
And then our last one was the, uh, voice actor for, um, uh, Axel in, uh, Kingdom Hearts. It was,

768
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:23,340
uh, Fujiwara Keiji, um, also, also died. Um, 55 years old, too. Um, he died of cancer.

769
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:30,460
Um, and he had taken a break from voice acting in, um, from August, 2016 to June,

770
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:36,700
2017 to go through treatment. Um, but, uh, you know, one of his other big roles, um,

771
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:43,580
he was the father, um, in Crayon Shin-chan, uh, Hiroshi. And he, um, was also Arden in

772
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:50,540
Final Fantasy 15 and Reno in Final Fantasy 7 Remake. So very recent loss, very recent voice

773
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:55,660
actor. So there you go. And it is, it is interesting that the first question everybody's

774
01:07:55,660 --> 01:08:01,260
asking in this day and age is, was it COVID? Um, and in this case, um, I believe Rick May

775
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:05,980
passed from COVID related complications, but, and they're, they're not St. Paul Haddad, the

776
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:12,140
cause of death was not released. So, um, don't know on that one. Um, or do you? No. Um, I,

777
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:15,740
I actually, I just closed it, but I thought that they had released it. Let me just double

778
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:23,180
check it again. And then, uh, Keiji, uh, Fujiwara, uh, was cancer, as you said. Yeah. So, um,

779
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:30,940
yeah, they did, they did release, um, what the cause of death was. Um, but, um, in other,

780
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:35,100
you know, we've also, uh, for COVID things, now this has nothing to do with video games,

781
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:43,420
but everyone knows who Christopher Cross is, right? Like from the eighties, you know, um,

782
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:51,100
but he is paralyzed because of COVID. We've lost some amazing people. One of our, our, uh,

783
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:58,220
or, uh, one of our, uh, big, uh, uh, names in trans right activism, uh, died as well. Very,

784
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:04,300
uh, very recently only, I think a couple of weeks ago. So, um, that definitely is the first thing

785
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:08,540
that we look at. Cause that seems to be the biggest killer in the United States is above

786
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:13,420
every other country in the world combined. Um, Tiger Claw and Chad is mentioning the,

787
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:19,100
uh, Danny Goldman passed this week. Uh, uh, not maybe known for games, but definitely known to

788
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:23,660
people for, uh, his role in young Frankenstein and was the voice of brainy Smurf. Uh, and then

789
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:29,420
I know we lost, uh, Brian Dennehy this week, who was very much a, that guy actor. Although

790
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:34,300
again, Brian Dennehy was not COVID. It's just, you know, people die of other causes and that

791
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:40,380
is all happening. Go back and watch Cocoon. Yeah. Yeah. He was very much at that. I always

792
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:44,540
think of, um, I know this is terrible, but I always think of the South Park movie cause

793
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:49,340
they're singing the Brian Boy Tonto song. And at one point they have Brian Dennehy showing up and

794
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:55,180
somebody goes, not fucking Brian Dennehy, Brian Boy Tonto. So, but he was definitely like, everybody

795
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:58,300
still knows who Brian Dennehy is. Like he's one of those like people you look at and you just,

796
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:04,300
yeah. Tiger claw mentioned, uh, first blood, you know, Rambo. So big girl. Yeah. Yeah. So,

797
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:09,900
um, very, very sad that, um, we're having all these losses, um, whether it be COVID or otherwise,

798
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:15,820
I know, especially with those people going out to the beach or gathering in groups,

799
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:21,660
protesting the thing that's keeping us safe. And my mom just told me that they lifted the work

800
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:27,100
restrictions in Alabama. Oh, wow. She's going back to work full time. Well, full time for her.

801
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:33,580
So yeah, I'm pissed and people are stupid, but it's, I'm trying not to get political,

802
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:38,060
but America is broken. America is broken. There's going to be a very hard lesson learned and it's

803
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:43,740
going to, it's going to be really, really unfortunate. So it's going to, the, the lesson

804
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:49,580
will be learned in blood and a story. All right. Well, let's move on to, um, something a little

805
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:55,900
less serious. Hopefully low key. I don't know. We're talking about Nintendo switch updates,

806
01:10:55,900 --> 01:11:00,540
so, you know, that could be a pretty serious stuff. Yeah. It's some serious stuff. No,

807
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:04,860
in this case, they're talking a little bit about, um, allowing you to actually be able to remap

808
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:10,060
your buttons on your Nintendo switch. So that's kind of cool because it's not something that

809
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:14,540
has been available. And I know that's something that was added to, like, I know the PlayStation,

810
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:18,940
not to, well, it was probably a while ago, but it's still pretty nice that they have that feature

811
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:24,060
available. So you can swap different things like A and B buttons, or, you know, change the

812
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:30,140
orientation of the analog stick, um, you know, whatever, whatever you want to do,

813
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:36,380
uh, which is pretty cool. So, um, pretty neat that they have that available, that you could

814
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:43,100
make those changes. So that was, um, that was pretty awesome. Uh, I have not planned on using

815
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:47,340
this at all though, unfortunately, cause I haven't got to touch my switch in a long time.

816
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:54,860
It just hog that thing for Minecraft. Your switch needs some touch.

817
01:11:55,900 --> 01:12:03,740
Well, it's, it misses proper affection. Yeah. I mean, um, I, I probably won't use this feature,

818
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:10,300
but I understand as far as accessibility reasons go, this is a very like easy fix for, um,

819
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:15,420
consoles to make, to help more people be able to play games on said consoles. So, um, I'm all for

820
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:20,380
it for that reason. You know, anything that opens up gaming or people is a good thing. So, um, yay

821
01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:25,100
to have those features in, even if it won't be something I use myself, maybe I'll use those new

822
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:29,820
animal crossing pictures. They put it, cause I think now your little icon, uh, on animal or on

823
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:35,500
the switch can be like six animal crossing characters, but yeah. Hmm. Do they have Ed?

824
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:39,580
No, I don't think they have Ed, but they might have her SETI, but don't quote me on that. I'd

825
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:45,660
have to, uh, I have to look. So, all right. Anyway. Um, all right. Well, let's move on and

826
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:49,660
talk a little bit about, uh, a game that I think is getting a lot of attention over on Twitch and

827
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:56,380
a lot of other places. And that is a game called Valorient, uh, which is a new Riot game, right?

828
01:12:56,380 --> 01:13:01,340
Of course, it's the makers of league of legends, which has been hugely popular on Twitch and other,

829
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:06,460
um, you know, competition type things, e-sports websites and stuff. Um, so many people have been

830
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:09,500
looking forward to, you know, what are some of the other things that Riot is going to develop

831
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:14,140
and one of those games that Riot's been working on, there's been others, uh, is Valorient, which

832
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:20,060
is, or is it Valorant? I thought there, is there an I in it or not? I'm not sure. Is it Valorant?

833
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:25,420
Maybe. Um, maybe somebody in chat's going to yell at me that I'm pronouncing it wrong. Yeah. I,

834
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:29,500
I don't know why, but I had an I inserted in it. Okay. So Valorants, excuse me. Sorry. I got it

835
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:34,300
wrong. Um, but, uh, for that game, I don't know. You have to apparently have a key to get in. So

836
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:38,060
it's not something I'm even playing right now anyway. So how would I, how could I be expected

837
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:44,300
to know the title? Uh, but Valorant, uh, is a new first person shooter game from, uh, Riot.

838
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:48,940
And, uh, it's causing a little bit of controversy though, because there is an anti-cheat system

839
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:53,020
that's being installed with the game. Now, not the anti-cheat systems are necessarily

840
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:59,180
controversial by nature, but this one called Riot Vanguard is apparently pretty aggressive because

841
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:03,260
it actually starts up when you start your computer up. It is not something that starts

842
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:08,460
when the game starts, such as say Fortnite's anti-cheat system launches when you launch the

843
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:12,780
game. But, you know, some folks, you know, that are kind of defending what Riot is doing with

844
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:18,780
this are saying, Hey, a lot of the ways people get around the Fortnite anti-cheat is that they

845
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:24,540
start those anti-cheats before they start, uh, Fortnite. So that way it kind of bypasses the

846
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:29,900
anti-cheat system. This being a little deeper in your computer boot up sequence, um, is a little

847
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:35,100
harder to subvert in those ways. Um, but of course, you know, people that want to really

848
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:39,500
control the type of information that's going in and out of their computer, not everybody's super

849
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:44,700
into that. Uh, in fact, on Reddit, some people are saying you have a piece of software that can't be

850
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:49,260
turned off. It runs with elevated privileges nonstop on your system. Let's say the anti-cheat

851
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:53,980
gets compromised tomorrow. You won't know that your computer is exposed and it won't update

852
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:59,980
until you start the game. Now, uh, one of the, uh, leads on the anti-cheat Paul Chamberlain

853
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:07,900
responded on subreddit to some of these, uh, uh, issues, um, saying, um, that basically, uh,

854
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:12,540
Vanguard is functioning the way it's supposed to. The anti-cheat driver itself is only one

855
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:17,340
small component of Vanguard. We've also built a new backend that allows us to be more specific

856
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:21,980
with our anti-cheat checks. Instead of running the same security stigands on all the computers,

857
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:25,660
we can run checks and response to player reports or other suspicious behavior,

858
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:29,660
which allow us to reduce the frequency and intensity of scans on the majority of players

859
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:35,740
computers. And it kind of, it kind of ends in this whole, like, you just have to trust us type of

860
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:42,460
thing. Um, we invite players who are unsure to observe our actions and call us out. If they don't

861
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:47,180
like what they see, we think most players will appreciate our efforts, but if they don't, then

862
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:55,580
we'll change tactics and find another way to meet our players' expectations. Hmm. So, um, and Quest

863
01:15:55,580 --> 01:16:00,700
Buster, uh, giving the secret on how to get into this game saying you have a chance to get a beta

864
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:05,900
key drop by watching a Valorant stream with a Twitch account linked to Riot. It's one reason

865
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:11,020
why Valorant streamers have titles emphasizing drops enabled. So people want you to come look

866
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:16,300
at their stream so that you have a chance to get into the game for yourself. So, um, but obviously

867
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:20,060
this anti-cheat thing being on all the time, it's something some folks may want to consider.

868
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:25,980
Something to go with that though, and I think this is important to say as well, um, Riot is offering

869
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:33,980
up to $100,000 if you can find a security flaw in Vanguard. Uh, it is a contest, I guess you could

870
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:39,100
say, being hosted at HackerOne. And, uh, that is a site where there's all sorts of tech companies

871
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:44,380
offering bounties for finding issues with their, um, uh, software and so forth. Um,

872
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:50,540
this starts at $25,000 for a bug that allows outside entities to access a user's private

873
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:57,100
information all the way to $100,000 for code execution at the kernel level. Basically meaning

874
01:16:57,100 --> 01:17:04,780
that somebody kind of like, I guess like an alien in the movie kind of face hugs on to this software

875
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:08,620
to do very bad things to your computer because it's something that boots up when your computer

876
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:14,860
boots up. So, um, I suppose that's one way to, uh, make a point about this software and make

877
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:20,460
some money off of it if you want. So, let's see, um, TigerKlonchat says, I wonder if it's

878
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:23,820
something you can go into the task manager and disable in the startup. I don't know,

879
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:27,740
because I haven't used it myself, but Bobby does make a good point. If it was, people wouldn't be

880
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:32,220
complaining. So yeah, I think, I think if it was easy enough to kill it like that, people probably

881
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:36,060
wouldn't be complaining. Um, so, you know, something to think about when you're going to

882
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:39,020
install the game, this isn't going to stop everybody from installing the game, you know,

883
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:45,660
and, and riot to give them some credit. They are saying, if you think there's a problem with it,

884
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:49,820
call us out, watch it, see what it does for yourself. And if you think it's doing anything,

885
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:54,540
it shouldn't be call us on it. So it is interesting. They're kind of taking that stance

886
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:58,300
where it's like, no, really, we're not taking any personal information. We're not doing anything

887
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:03,980
like watch, you know, so it's, I'm less interested in what it's potentially going to do to my system

888
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:08,940
in one more interest in if it's actually going to still work, because it seems like whenever

889
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:14,620
these anti-cheat things are put in place, it just prompts people to try to find something that's

890
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:19,420
subverted. So I guess we'll have to wait and see. So it'd be interesting. It'll be interesting to

891
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:24,780
see if somebody wants to do it for the $100,000 bounty or wants to do it just so they can do it.

892
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:29,580
We'll see what happens. The internet's an interesting place sometimes.

893
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:31,660
Why can't we have both?

894
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:36,620
And we probably will. But in the meantime, we'll go to our next story, Darsakra.

895
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:43,100
Well, how about something happy, something positive? Well, I mean, it's not really happy.

896
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:49,260
But it's, I guess, positive. Because remember, positive things aren't always happy things.

897
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:58,380
So there is a gamer who played Final Fantasy XIV. Rob, this is relevant to your interests,

898
01:18:58,380 --> 01:18:59,420
I'm sure. Yes, of course.

899
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:08,940
But in-game, he was known as Fern LeRoy, L-E apostrophe R-O-Y. And he was very, very popular,

900
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:15,900
well-liked by his free company and lots of people. And he died of the novel coronavirus.

901
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:23,180
And it went out on Reddit about it. They started talking about it. And they had a funeral

902
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:30,540
procession. So on his server, which is the Zalera server, they started off in Uldah,

903
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:37,740
in the desert. And they were joined by characters from another server, Core, where his alt was on,

904
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:46,860
named Poppy Rose. And the whole group wore black. They had black parasols. They wore very funeral

905
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:53,580
appropriate clothing. And they walked all the way through the central shroud and ended up at

906
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:59,980
the Guardian Tree. I mean, sacred site in the game. It took 30 minutes of in-game time to make

907
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:06,060
the walk. Because they were walking and not running. Many people run by default, but these

908
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:13,980
folks walked. Yeah, it was a very slow procession. As I recall, there's videos of it. There were live

909
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:24,540
tweets of it, all of that. And they finally ended with some words and, I guess, a virtual funeral.

910
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:34,220
So as it went, they all went on to Twitter, talked about what the people did. And one of the quotes

911
01:20:34,220 --> 01:20:39,340
on there is, the Final Fantasy XIV community never ceases to amaze me. Such a huge turnout and show

912
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:44,540
respect to community and camaraderie at this memorial service. My view distance couldn't

913
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:50,620
handle so many people. May the fallen player rest in peace. My condolences to all involved. Be safe,

914
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:57,340
everyone. And I mean, basically, another person said that it took up two to three zones of the

915
01:20:57,340 --> 01:21:03,980
base game. So pretty big. And so many people offering their condolences. It was just really,

916
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:12,060
really beautiful. And not the first time we've seen other players honor somebody in a game.

917
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:19,740
For sure. But this is a very big one to do it in a big MMO and cross server. So, hey.

918
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:25,020
Well, and I think also, yes, you're right. We've heard of this type of memorial before. It's not

919
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:29,820
the first time it's even happened in Final Fantasy XIV. And I'm sure many people have seen this sort

920
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:39,260
of similar memorial in EverQuest or World of Warcraft or insert many other major MMOs here.

921
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:45,260
But I also think the reason why this is kind of newsworthy all over again, and why this particular

922
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:51,500
story is getting the credit it is, is because for many people, you can't really memorialize in

923
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:56,380
person right now. That's what makes everything that's going on almost even more tragic is that

924
01:21:56,380 --> 01:22:02,620
those that pass really can't be properly, and I'm using my quoting fingers, memorialized because

925
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:08,940
people can't gather in one place. So this is one way that people are getting around that of sorts

926
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:13,900
by doing a virtual type of memorial. And I almost wonder if this isn't the type of thing you might

927
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:21,420
see more of in these. I mean, not that I would wish that, but I think it might just be one of

928
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:30,380
those, because of that issue we have, you might see this happen more often. And even in things

929
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:36,700
like Animal Crossing, not even things like funerals, but like weddings, drag shows, I mean,

930
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:42,380
you name it, things that people gather to do in person, they're doing an Animal Crossing, and MMOs

931
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:48,860
and stuff, I'm sure. So it's an interesting sign of the times, even if this isn't the first time

932
01:22:48,860 --> 01:22:53,500
we've heard a story like that. There was one instance in Animal Crossing where the person made

933
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:58,780
an 18 tile image of her mother who had just died and they couldn't hold a funeral.

934
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:09,180
That's really sad. Yeah. And so she spent time taking an actual photo, bringing it into the

935
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:15,340
pattern maker and trying to get it all just right to have a picture, a memorial to her mother. And

936
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:22,300
it was like, it took her two weeks to do it and then have a funeral in game.

937
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:29,900
And not to go on the sad point of this, but unhappy things, like I said, I was using this

938
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:37,100
for my birthday, to have a little birthday party today. So people are also using the games for

939
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:42,140
happier occasions. For sure. Not everything is a Zoom meeting, although certainly that's getting

940
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:48,060
used a lot too. So, all right. Well, let's move on. Just a couple more stories before we get to

941
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:54,380
the classic game of the week. Loki. Let's talk about more things that are closed. So unfortunately,

942
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:59,260
with E3 and everything being canceled, we were kind of hoping that maybe Gamescom might be the

943
01:23:59,260 --> 01:24:05,340
answer to getting some of our gaming news. Fortunately, because of a ruling in Germany

944
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:10,940
that has basically banned any large gatherings until the end of August, Gamescom is also going

945
01:24:10,940 --> 01:24:17,820
to be canceled. So what's good though is they are refunding all the tickets that were already

946
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:23,100
ordered, but unfortunately they're not going to have a live event. Now they're planning on maybe

947
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:28,780
doing a digital event. So they're working on that, but there's not really any details on that just

948
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:37,660
yet. So hopefully we'll have something digital from them coming around the same time. That,

949
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:45,180
as well as we also news that San Diego Comic-Con has also been canceled. San Diego Comic-Con,

950
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:50,940
of course, mostly a comic convention as well as like moving properties like that,

951
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:56,540
but they do have some gaming announcements and gaming stuff sometimes coming out of that as well.

952
01:24:56,540 --> 01:25:02,460
So unfortunately this year they're not going to be doing that either. Yeah. I think like when

953
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:07,900
Marvel versus Capcom 3 or Infinite or whatever it was called was coming out, like they announced

954
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:13,820
a lot of stuff at Comic-Con. So sometimes you get some kind of gaming tangents, we'll say.

955
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:17,980
Yeah. So that's unfortunate that they're not going to be doing that, but they did announce

956
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:24,300
that they'll be returning next year, July 22nd through the 25th. So that's unfortunate,

957
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:27,900
lots of stuff that we're looking forward to. Hopefully we'll get those announcements anyways.

958
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:31,340
And besides, you know, I can't go to Comic-Con, so I got to wait for all those trailers to hit

959
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:36,860
online anyways. So whatever. Yeah. I mean, it honestly, at this point just seems like if it's

960
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:42,940
a convention in 2020, it's probably not going to happen. So, you know, and that obviously makes me

961
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:48,700
sad and I still I'm crossing my fingers and my toes that maybe a miracle happens. Maybe anything

962
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:53,900
is possible after all, especially the whole world working on it, but I'm slowly accepting that

963
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:58,700
reality as sad as it is. So it'll just make that next year. And once we get on the other side of

964
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:06,380
this, it'll make it all that much sweeter, I suppose. So, all right. Well, maybe some good

965
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:13,020
news about what's going on with the ESRB is that finally, after all this time, and it feels like

966
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:18,860
really one of those things where it's like, finally, they did this. The ESRB is now adding

967
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:24,460
to their ratings if a game has loot boxes, except they're not calling it that, they're calling it

968
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:30,060
in-game purchases. So if the game has microtransactions, it will have a little

969
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:33,340
addition to the label underneath. It doesn't affect the letter rating and that can still be,

970
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:37,740
you know, E for everyone or, you know, excuse me, the typical ratings that the video games use.

971
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:43,260
But, you know, it always says why, like, why did this game get an M? It's not just in-game

972
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:46,540
purchases because that's been a thing that's already been happening, but now they're including

973
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:50,380
if it includes random items. I'm sorry. Yes, thank you. I would have gotten there eventually. Yes,

974
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:55,500
it includes random items is the other key word there with the in-game purchases. And that means,

975
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:59,900
because they're not saying loot boxes, because I guess that's not really a term they expect

976
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:03,900
everybody to know. They did explain it on their website why they didn't use loot boxes, but,

977
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:08,940
you know, whatever. They're still kind of making it clear that that is the reason why they're

978
01:27:08,940 --> 01:27:13,420
putting it on the rating. And so it will be assigned to all games that include purchases

979
01:27:13,420 --> 01:27:19,820
with any randomized elements, including loot boxes, gotcha games, item or card packs. So

980
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:25,820
that would affect things like Magic the Gathering online and stuff too. Prize wheel or what's

981
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:33,100
blizzards? Hearthstone, things like that. Prize wheels, treasure chests, and more. Games that have

982
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:38,540
the in-game purchases includes random items. Notice may also include other non-randomized

983
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:43,100
paid elements. And I'm thinking that might be something like Overwatch that, you know,

984
01:27:43,740 --> 01:27:48,700
it kind of has a little bit of both. So not, well, not very often, but I have seen them sell skins

985
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:55,260
for charity. So that would count. So anyway, there it is. That is what they're doing.

986
01:27:56,380 --> 01:28:02,700
What do you guys think? It's about time, right? It's one of those things where it's like, oh,

987
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:07,100
now that it's happened, there's so much other crap going on in the world. It's like, oh,

988
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:14,860
you finally caught up. Great. Have a cookie. It's not hardly even catching up. It's just like,

989
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:18,940
they're just kind of checking off that box. Like, see, we're doing something. We care.

990
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:23,260
But really they don't. I mean, I just, I don't think anybody,

991
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:29,660
they're never going to do anything because unfortunately the ESA, well, this isn't

992
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:38,060
necessarily ESA, but I don't know. A lot of lobbying done by the ESA because for these

993
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:42,300
publishers, this is a very big revenue source for them. So of course they're not going to want to

994
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:46,620
get rid of this stuff. And so they're just basically saying, you know, kind of checking

995
01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:51,980
the boxes so that when this controversy comes up, oh, it's gambling. But we tell you that it's in

996
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:56,060
the game. We have the ratings. It shows it on here. See, we're not trying to trick you,

997
01:28:56,620 --> 01:29:02,060
you know, that type of stuff. So it'll be interesting to see that also includes like,

998
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:08,780
you know, some of these games that add it after the fact, because I know that a lot of times the

999
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:16,060
boxes will be printed with these certain ratings. And then like, for example, the crash team racing

1000
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:21,100
stuff had loot boxes added after the game came out and after it's been reviewed. And I'm thinking

1001
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:24,700
that a lot of times when these ratings are updated, they don't necessarily update them

1002
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:30,300
to the printed box copies, but they will update the ratings on the ESRB website. Like anybody

1003
01:29:31,180 --> 01:29:40,060
even goes there to look at anything. So I don't know. I just, good job. At least you tried.

1004
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:48,540
All right. ESRB, this claps for you. Here we go. One clap instead of a round of applause. You get one

1005
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:53,180
clap. All right. Let's move on. Let's move on to simpler times when there was no, there were no

1006
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:58,380
random items purchasable for money. You got what you got with your cartridge and you were happy

1007
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:01,900
with it. It's a classic game of the week. Dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault

1008
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:08,620
and find a game that she thinks, Hey, Hey, you play this, not that, uh, dark Sakura,

1009
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:15,180
what is your pick for the classic game of the week? I picked F zero, which is another thing

1010
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:20,140
I'm surprised I've never picked before. Me too. This is, this is one of my big classics. I love

1011
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:26,700
this game. Yeah. I love me some F zero and I might've sat and jammed out to the mute city,

1012
01:30:26,780 --> 01:30:30,460
you know, uh, level, cause honestly it's my favorite music in the game.

1013
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:38,860
Um, so yeah, um, F zero is, uh, one of those, uh, early racing game. Well, not really early

1014
01:30:38,860 --> 01:30:45,180
for the super Nintendo, but it was, uh, I'd say one of those notable games. It was the first,

1015
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:50,620
of course of the F zero series. It was a launch title for the SNES. So yes, it was early for,

1016
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:57,420
for the super Nintendo. Um, it has been emulated on a virtual console services. Um,

1017
01:30:57,420 --> 01:31:02,940
and I'll, I'll get into, of course, other releases of it, but the game is taking place in 2560

1018
01:31:03,580 --> 01:31:12,060
where, um, you, uh, race formula one races, uh, called F zero. Um, and basically it's just bored

1019
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:17,580
rich people who made up these kinds of races. And so you have, uh, you know, all of your,

1020
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:22,540
you know, various characters who race and you've got, you know, power ups here and there are very

1021
01:31:22,540 --> 01:31:31,340
futuristic, really good music, some floating areas. Um, um, but the races and F zero, uh,

1022
01:31:31,340 --> 01:31:37,180
are five laps around a track. You have to complete each lap in a successfully higher place so that

1023
01:31:37,180 --> 01:31:43,100
you're not disqualified as you're going through. So, um, you are also given a four second speed

1024
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:49,260
boost when you pass, um, a lap called the super jet and you get points determined by what place

1025
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:57,340
you're on. Um, and you can even, uh, get an extra machine so that you can, uh, retry the course.

1026
01:31:57,340 --> 01:32:02,060
Um, if you, if you've got a certain points and you haven't made it through. So, um, you've got

1027
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:06,780
two different methods of boosting your speed. You have these plates that will launch you into the

1028
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:16,860
air with, um, extra acceleration. Um, and then, um, you, uh, also have, uh, uh, just the, the

1029
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:22,300
general, uh, dash zones that, uh, increase your speed on the ground. Um, you have two modes of

1030
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:26,700
play of grand prix mode where you choose a league and you race against other vehicles in there,

1031
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:32,220
and then practice mode where you just basically play, play along, play along. Um, your, your

1032
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:37,900
15 tracks divided into three leagues. So you have a knight queen and king. Those are the difficulty

1033
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:43,100
levels. Um, and each league has up to four selectable levels in there. You have beginner

1034
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:49,180
standard expert master. Um, you've got multiple courses for death, wind, port town and red canyon.

1035
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:55,980
Um, they have a pathway that's not accessible, um, until you're on another iteration of that,

1036
01:32:55,980 --> 01:33:00,140
of that track. And then it closes the previous pack. So it kind of moves things around here.

1037
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:07,420
Um, as far as, um, the development in this game, it, um, in Japan, it was a launch title,

1038
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:13,020
November 1st, 1990. Um, it came out in the U S August, 1991 in Europe, uh, sometime in 1992.

1039
01:33:13,660 --> 01:33:16,940
And in the Japanese market, it was only that in super Mario world that came out.

1040
01:33:17,580 --> 01:33:23,260
Um, in North America, of course, we had zero pilot wings, uh, SimCity, Gradius three, and,

1041
01:33:23,260 --> 01:33:31,180
uh, and super Mario world. But, um, the game was produced by Miyamoto. Um, uh, artwork was done by,

1042
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:40,220
uh, Shimizu Kazunobu. Um, one of the, uh, art designers, um, was, uh, basically, uh, and his

1043
01:33:40,220 --> 01:33:45,660
name, sorry, Imamura Takaya, um, got some pretty free reign for doing some of the design for the

1044
01:33:45,660 --> 01:33:51,500
characters and the courses. Um, so they really kind of went all out. And one of the good things

1045
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:55,900
about this game is that this is really, I think one of the games that gave us a clear introduction

1046
01:33:55,900 --> 01:34:04,700
to mode seven. Um, yeah, that's like the cute. Yeah, go ahead. So mode seven for, for, for y'all

1047
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:12,460
kids, you don't know what the mode seven is. Um, it is a way of raster scaling. So basically,

1048
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:17,340
I'm sure you've heard the word vector. I'm sure you've heard raster, um, vector uses mathematical

1049
01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:22,940
calculations. So that's why, say in a vector designed game or vector art, no matter how much

1050
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:27,420
you resize it, it stays the same because it's all mathematically recalculating itself. Raster

1051
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:32,940
is going to be basically pixel. So yeah, you did get like zoomed in pixels on everything. I mean,

1052
01:34:32,940 --> 01:34:41,500
think of, uh, uh, what am I trying to think of that had a really bad zoom in? Um, but at any rate,

1053
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:48,940
you, you had, you know, but it would move and scale and it gave you this, uh, pseudo 3d. Um,

1054
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:56,060
and, uh, it really was mind blowing at the time. I mean, we had racing games before,

1055
01:34:56,060 --> 01:35:00,300
but this was the big one. Yeah. Like, you know, and again, I know, uh, we have, you know, a lot

1056
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:05,420
of folks in their twenties and low thirties who may not have really been around or were very,

1057
01:35:05,420 --> 01:35:09,660
very, very young when this game first came out. But like, you know, many of us that are hosting

1058
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:14,380
the show were like, you know, like 12 and 13 and so forth when this game first came out.

1059
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:20,540
And I got to tell you, it was mind blowing. Like it, like the 3d in this game, the fact it was

1060
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:26,700
like all in a cartridge and just like how it moved so fast. And I don't know if that was part

1061
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:30,860
of the intentional design of why they did the game the way that they did, but in a stage like

1062
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:36,780
mute city, it's going by so fast. It looks like it's a real city down there, even though if you,

1063
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:41,260
even though if you take a look, cause it really it's, it's just like a painted sprite. It's like

1064
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:45,900
something you could have done a Mario paint, really a 2d Mario paint that they do this mode

1065
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:50,940
seven effect on and then layer the, um, sprite of the car on top of it. It's, it's really brilliant.

1066
01:35:50,940 --> 01:35:54,380
But when it goes that fast, it looks like a city. But when you look at it kind of standing still,

1067
01:35:54,380 --> 01:36:01,260
you can see it's kind of garbage, but it doesn't matter. That's something that, that designers do.

1068
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:04,700
I mean, like for example, if you have a billboard, you know, your print in a book,

1069
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:10,700
resolution should be 300 DPI, 300 dots per inch. When you're doing, say something on a billboard,

1070
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:14,540
it's going to be half that, you know, it's going to be higher than web quality, for example. But

1071
01:36:14,540 --> 01:36:18,940
when you're looking at it from that distance, moving that fast, it doesn't need to be 300 DPI.

1072
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:24,460
And that's what they're going with. It's, it's an illusion. It's a, uh, chunk dull, you know,

1073
01:36:24,460 --> 01:36:28,300
the, the trick, the eye. Yeah. And it's, and I don't know if you were going to bring it up,

1074
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:33,740
so I'm sorry if I'm talking ahead of you, but, um, you know, Mario Kart obviously was a huge,

1075
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:38,460
you know, in some ways successor to this, but Mario Kart essentially uses all the same tricks

1076
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:45,740
of F-Zero. It's all the same tricks. The only, in many ways, Super Mario Kart is F-Zero too.

1077
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:51,180
And I know that sounds a little weird, but without F-Zero, you would not have Mario Kart.

1078
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:56,860
It's really, it's really that simple. No, I, I get that. I absolutely get that.

1079
01:36:57,660 --> 01:37:00,380
Um, and you know, there is really

1080
01:37:02,540 --> 01:37:10,540
so much, you know, that people, I think, take for granted about, um, about this game and what it

1081
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:15,500
really is offered, you know, and we've had many other ones, which I'll be touching on, uh, later

1082
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:20,460
and, you know, they've been certainly popular and well talked about on this show. So, um, you know,

1083
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:27,980
looking at this, it really is, I think what modernized the racing game for the home console.

1084
01:37:28,780 --> 01:37:35,900
Make sense? Yes. And a few other things with that mode seven is that it also allowed for

1085
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:40,300
different texture mapping, you know, and I'm not going to get in way too much into a little bit

1086
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:43,740
more of that. We talked about what it does in practice as opposed to what it does on the back

1087
01:37:43,740 --> 01:37:49,020
end. So I'm going to get into a little bit more of the periphery about it and how it was received

1088
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:55,420
when we had come on since then. So did you know there was an F-Zero jazz album? I did. Somebody

1089
01:37:55,420 --> 01:38:01,820
got me a copy of that way back in the day. I did. The songs translate well to jazz. In fact, um,

1090
01:38:01,820 --> 01:38:07,580
in Mario Kart 8, because they bring back, I think those like, they're kind of jazzy covers. They're

1091
01:38:07,580 --> 01:38:12,700
not the same jazzy covers, but they're, they're also jazz inspired, uh, versions of the tracks in

1092
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:19,260
Mario Kart when they do the F-Zero levels. Well, and the other one of the other things too, is that,

1093
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:26,940
um, the, uh, great. I lost my train of thought. Um, the album actually did bring in some, some

1094
01:38:26,940 --> 01:38:32,300
notable musicians. I mean, basically maybe, maybe if you weren't super big into jazz might not know

1095
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:37,980
them, but we had, uh, uh, uh, for playing on saxophone, Mark Russo of the yellow jackets,

1096
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:44,460
Robin Ford on electric guitar, um, you had for your, uh, 12 tracks on, uh, from the game were

1097
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:51,180
composed by, uh, Kanki Umiko and Ishida Naoto with arrangements by Robert Hill and Michiko Hill.

1098
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:55,820
Um, so it actually, I think it's a really good album. It's a kind of a, kind of a chill fun thing

1099
01:38:55,820 --> 01:39:02,540
to listen to, you know. Um, but the game itself was very well received. Um, and basically they,

1100
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:09,420
they thought it was some of the most fluid pseudo 3d of its time. Um, it got, I mean, just, you know,

1101
01:39:09,420 --> 01:39:17,180
I'll put it this way, Famitsu gave it a 37 out of 40. That's pretty good for Famitsu. Yeah. Yeah.

1102
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:23,020
IGN gave it a 7.5 out of 10, which I don't know why, because it was better than that. Um, it had

1103
01:39:23,020 --> 01:39:30,620
variety of tracks. Um, it had really, uh, I'm trying to think of a good way. Well, actually,

1104
01:39:30,860 --> 01:39:36,620
GameSpy, uh, one of the writers said that it was a finesse racer. Um, it took practice and

1105
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:44,060
memorization and a fine, uh, sense of control. So I think that it really did bring more excitement to

1106
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:50,700
a genre that maybe had started to fall a little bit. Um, and as far as, uh, its, uh, legacy,

1107
01:39:50,700 --> 01:39:55,900
it did invent that futuristic racing genre. Would we have had Wipeout without that? Um, would we

1108
01:39:55,900 --> 01:40:02,940
have had, um, any of these other kind of high-tech future racing games? Um, Daytona, um, USA even was

1109
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:11,900
inspired by F-Zero. Um, and, uh, in fact, even, uh, the president of, uh, amusement's vision,

1110
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:19,980
uh, Nagoshi Toshihiro stated that, um, F-Zero taught him what a game should be and influenced

1111
01:40:19,980 --> 01:40:26,220
him to create Daytona USA. So, and then it's also amusement vision that did work with Nintendo,

1112
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:33,260
um, to create F-Zero GX and AX. And Nagoshi was one of the, uh, co-producers of the game. So,

1113
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:39,260
like I said, there were sequels. Um, of course, they had developed a sequel of F-Zero on this

1114
01:40:39,260 --> 01:40:46,460
nest. Um, but, uh, it was supposed to be for the Satellaview, um, subscription, uh, using that add

1115
01:40:46,460 --> 01:40:53,660
on. Um, and in fact, you could get F-Zero from one of the download kiosks, um, in Japan. It was,

1116
01:40:53,660 --> 01:41:03,420
oh crap, what was it called? Um, the, uh, I know what it was called. It was, um, I'm forgetting

1117
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:08,780
what it was called. It was like a download kiosk that gave you, um, one of, you know, it kind of

1118
01:41:08,780 --> 01:41:12,460
was like how the, um, the Famicom disc works. Yeah, I was gonna say, I've read about those,

1119
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:16,220
especially for the Famicom disc system. Nintendo Power. It was called the Nintendo Power. Oh,

1120
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:19,820
how funny. Maybe that's where the magazine got its name, but yeah, we didn't have anything like

1121
01:41:19,820 --> 01:41:24,060
that in the US, obviously. That was very much a Japanese only type of thing, but that's, you know,

1122
01:41:24,060 --> 01:41:28,380
a big reason why Famicom had a disc system. Yeah. Yeah. And the Satellaview too, obviously,

1123
01:41:28,380 --> 01:41:35,180
would never hear either. Um, but at any rate, um, you, uh, if you had the, uh, Saint Giga

1124
01:41:35,180 --> 01:41:40,380
subscription for Satellaview, um, on the Super Famicom, you could, you could get that kind of

1125
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:45,020
add on version and then you could download those titles and save it on the flash ROM cartridge.

1126
01:41:45,020 --> 01:41:48,860
Um, the sequel was released as the name of BS F-Zero Grand Prix, cause you know,

1127
01:41:48,860 --> 01:41:54,220
they're all the BS Satellaview and BS F-Zero Grand Prix too. Um, you can get lots of them

1128
01:41:54,220 --> 01:42:01,980
to say it now in the words, but, um, the F-Zero, uh, Grand Prix had a new track along with the

1129
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:07,740
original 15 and four different playable vehicles. And according to Nintendo Power, um, they wanted

1130
01:42:07,820 --> 01:42:14,700
to bring it to North America via a game pack. Um, but it didn't. Um, so as far as other ones we had

1131
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:22,220
on the Nintendo 64 F-Zero X, where, um, they continued to, um, you know, to, to try to push

1132
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:27,340
what that system could do. Um, and there was a lot of pushing to be done. Let me tell you, um,

1133
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:32,220
they also brought the mode seven graphic effects into the Game Boy advanced version for

1134
01:42:32,860 --> 01:42:41,020
maximum velocity and GP legend, um, which, uh, the former was released in 2001. Um,

1135
01:42:41,020 --> 01:42:47,580
and it was considered to be a hard over overhaul of F-Zero. Um, there was also F-Zero GX and AX,

1136
01:42:47,580 --> 01:42:53,740
which were, um, uh, uh, respectively released for the Nintendo GameCube and Triforce arcade

1137
01:42:53,740 --> 01:43:00,940
system boards in 2003. And it was the first, uh, big video game collaboration between Nintendo and

1138
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:06,620
Sega. And I really, we, we, we here at orange on radio cannot understate how good those games were

1139
01:43:06,620 --> 01:43:13,420
and how fabulous that whole like arcade connection was. It was just, it was amazing. Unmatched since

1140
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:22,060
then. And GX was the first of zero game that had a story mode. Um, AX was also, um, uh, called,

1141
01:43:22,060 --> 01:43:27,180
uh, little GameStop said that, you know, GameStop GameSpot said they're the first to get a proper

1142
01:43:27,180 --> 01:43:33,340
arcade release. So, um, and then of course the most recent one is F-Zero climax that came out

1143
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:39,340
for a Game Boy advanced in 2004 and the first, uh, F-Zero game to have a built-in, uh, track

1144
01:43:39,340 --> 01:43:44,860
editor without needing an expansion or add-on. I was going to say, uh, GX actually has, well,

1145
01:43:44,860 --> 01:43:51,420
it's hidden in the code, but actually has the AX like interface in tracks and everything in there.

1146
01:43:51,420 --> 01:43:56,380
I know you can unlock some tracks when you link it with the arcade, but they actually had the

1147
01:43:56,940 --> 01:44:03,660
AX mode in there that they never enabled. Yeah. I remember that. But at any rate, I mean,

1148
01:44:03,660 --> 01:44:11,500
there we go. It's such a prime game and I'm sorry, I had never even done this on, uh, uh,

1149
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:16,460
for the classic game of the week because I really, really believe that we are due for a new F-Zero.

1150
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:23,500
We are over due for a new F-Zero. It's been 16 years, Nintendo. I'm just, I am sad that Mario

1151
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:27,980
Kart has just taken over Nintendo, which I, and don't get me wrong, I love Mario Kart. So it's

1152
01:44:27,980 --> 01:44:33,180
not like I'm like really mad about it. I think, I think Mario Kart has just taken over Nintendo's

1153
01:44:33,180 --> 01:44:36,700
racing thing because I think at the end of the day, Mario Kart sold better. You put Mario in it

1154
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:41,260
and it sells better. And you know, that's, that's on us for not supporting F-Zero. Well, I mean,

1155
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:46,700
you, me and Matt have always supported F-Zero, but, uh, you know, it's on the general gaming

1156
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:51,580
populace for not supporting it the same way that they support Mario. I wish they would do more DLC

1157
01:44:51,580 --> 01:44:58,940
maybe 16 years. There's a good portion of the populace that wasn't alive. I know, I know,

1158
01:44:58,940 --> 01:45:03,580
I know. No, you're right. You're right. But, um, yeah, it is funny because some folks in

1159
01:45:03,580 --> 01:45:07,580
chatter, like I swear you've done F-Zero this game of the week before, but like, I know,

1160
01:45:07,580 --> 01:45:11,340
I think that's just because I looked on the Wiki. No, I don't think I know, but it's, it's one of

1161
01:45:11,340 --> 01:45:16,140
those. I think it's because we talk so much about, and maybe we've done F-Zero AX and GX. We probably

1162
01:45:16,140 --> 01:45:20,620
did those games in some way, but, um, maybe it's because we talk so much about how much we love

1163
01:45:20,620 --> 01:45:25,500
F-Zero and that these games need to come back that it seems like we've done it as a classic

1164
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:31,740
game of the week. So anyway, um, orange right says, isn't F-Zero on the super Nintendo switch

1165
01:45:31,740 --> 01:45:36,620
online? Yes, it is. And it's on the classic, uh, super Nintendo mini. So, uh, many ways to still

1166
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:42,300
officially revisit this game legally without having to download a ROM. So, um, yeah, get on it,

1167
01:45:42,300 --> 01:45:46,860
kids check out, uh, F-Zero and, uh, think about how you wouldn't have Mario Kart without it.

1168
01:45:47,660 --> 01:45:51,500
So we talked a lot, we let the video loop twice on that. We talked about that. What are you doing

1169
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:56,860
with your life? Seriously? Get with game. Uh, honestly though, like, even if you can't like

1170
01:45:56,860 --> 01:46:01,100
super get into the original, because the original does feel a little plain now, uh, you know,

1171
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:05,900
cause like there's only like one type of car you're ever passing us over, like try somehow

1172
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:10,460
to play F-Zero GX. And I really wish Nintendo would bring that back somehow, even if they just

1173
01:46:10,460 --> 01:46:15,180
bring back F-Zero GX, like I would so support that coming out on, on switch.

1174
01:46:15,980 --> 01:46:20,780
I also want to point out to Bobby who says, you know what they need to do. They need to

1175
01:46:20,780 --> 01:46:23,900
make a spinoff game. That's based on the smash brothers character, captain Falcon

1176
01:46:24,940 --> 01:46:34,460
whale. There was an anime called F-Zero GP legend that, um, talked, uh, had quite a bit of, um,

1177
01:46:34,460 --> 01:46:38,300
of captain Falcon in it. He is actually one of the main protagonists in it. Um,

1178
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:47,420
uh, he is, uh, named Bart otherwise, but yeah, it's, uh, basically, uh, had this whole plot

1179
01:46:47,420 --> 01:46:51,580
around, uh, captain Falcon. And yeah, he was the main protagonist in the GX story mode.

1180
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:57,100
All right. Well, let's, uh, yeah. And the other interesting thing about GX is that they had

1181
01:46:57,100 --> 01:47:02,220
a record. I was saying something about it because not everyone knows that they have like,

1182
01:47:03,020 --> 01:47:07,340
like something like 32 characters in F-Zero GX. So there's a ton of characters,

1183
01:47:07,340 --> 01:47:12,540
every single one of them has a theme song. And like, unless you go into the character

1184
01:47:12,540 --> 01:47:17,020
information screen, you'll never hear it. It's so interesting to me how like, there's so many

1185
01:47:17,020 --> 01:47:23,100
characters and so many theme songs and you probably missed them in F-Zero. It's just

1186
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:31,500
interesting. So audio blink. Yeah, for sure. And I was going to say, and if for those fans of DDR,

1187
01:47:32,060 --> 01:47:37,260
a couple of the characters had clips, uh, from, um, it's not, well, it's not clips,

1188
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:46,140
but it, it, it samples the same samples as legend of max. Really? Yes. I, I, I back in the day when

1189
01:47:46,140 --> 01:47:53,740
I did these, like some, I did a lot of the Loki remix things. Those are good. Some of the lamer

1190
01:47:53,740 --> 01:48:00,460
low key remixes were like, uh, with one of those songs and yeah, it has, has the fly and stuff

1191
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:03,900
like that in there. I wonder if I need to play those on Twitch some night. I wonder if I could

1192
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:07,580
get away with playing those on Twitch. It would depend which ones, probably the, the ones rooted

1193
01:48:07,580 --> 01:48:11,740
in Bamani are probably fine, but maybe some of your, like the ones from the matrix soundtrack,

1194
01:48:11,740 --> 01:48:15,500
I probably couldn't do those, but, uh, yeah, we'll have to play some of those some night.

1195
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:19,420
All right. Anyway. Uh, thank you. It was a good classic of the week. Really good. Um,

1196
01:48:19,420 --> 01:48:23,820
well, I mean, they're all good, but that one was particularly good. Extra good. Extra good. All

1197
01:48:23,820 --> 01:48:28,860
right. Uh, anyway, let's move on. Uh, rapid fire news. Uh, we got still a lot of news to cover.

1198
01:48:28,860 --> 01:48:35,580
Let's get to it. Loki. All right. So let's talk a little bit about, uh, Terraria. So that's a game

1199
01:48:35,580 --> 01:48:40,940
that we haven't brought up in a long time, but Hey, they're doing their final update on May 16th

1200
01:48:40,940 --> 01:48:49,420
on PC. So the game's been out since 2011 and their final update called a title or is it journeys end

1201
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:54,780
is going to be coming out on all of the, I at least on PC at first. And then I assume

1202
01:48:54,780 --> 01:48:59,340
the other platforms as well. Uh, it's going to add a bunch of new items, characters, and

1203
01:48:59,340 --> 01:49:03,980
mini biomes. So look forward to that. I think that's something that's in my library that

1204
01:49:03,980 --> 01:49:11,820
haven't played ever. So maybe I'll have to check it out and then, well, just when you thought your

1205
01:49:11,820 --> 01:49:16,620
PC can run everything, they have to go and remaster crisis. So that's going to be coming

1206
01:49:16,620 --> 01:49:22,780
out as well on PC PlayStation four, Xbox one and the switch. So if you got that brand new switch

1207
01:49:22,780 --> 01:49:28,300
and you really want to turn it into a melted piece of rubble, then run some crisis remastered

1208
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:34,540
on that. And that should be coming out. Uh, let's see, I don't know if they have a date on that yet,

1209
01:49:34,540 --> 01:49:40,300
but later this year. And, um, so what are we going to get with the remastered? Uh,

1210
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:47,660
it's going to actually have HD texture packs. I, uh, enhance campaign, improved art assets,

1211
01:49:47,660 --> 01:49:53,900
temporal anti-aliasing, um, a lot of other fun stuff. And I assume that you have obviously

1212
01:49:53,900 --> 01:50:00,460
switched probably running a little less of that, but, um, maybe even some retracing and stuff. So

1213
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:07,580
pretty awesome. Uh, we'll have to, uh, check it out. And fun fact, uh, the game was set in 2020.

1214
01:50:07,580 --> 01:50:15,660
So yeah. How topical. All right. Well, moving on a little bit of a follow-up something we talked

1215
01:50:15,660 --> 01:50:20,620
about last week and the fact that the, uh, Japanese Nintendo switch shipments were on hold

1216
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:24,860
because some of the, um, COVID related, uh, lockdowns and et cetera that are going on

1217
01:50:24,860 --> 01:50:30,540
overseas, uh, a follow-up this week indicates that Nintendo will, uh, begin to resume shipping

1218
01:50:30,540 --> 01:50:34,940
of Nintendo switch units later this week, which probably by the time now that I'm reading this

1219
01:50:34,940 --> 01:50:39,740
already occurred, uh, they did halt the distribution of the console because of COVID-19

1220
01:50:39,740 --> 01:50:44,940
related issues. Um, but because of global demand, they are continuing shipments. Um,

1221
01:50:44,940 --> 01:50:50,940
so there you go, uh, that, that is continuing. So hopefully those get to be a little bit easier to

1222
01:50:50,940 --> 01:50:55,420
find, but I also hope they are being done safely. I don't have a lot of details as to

1223
01:50:56,060 --> 01:51:01,180
how they made that happen again, but hopefully it is safe. I don't know. Uh, also, uh, a quick

1224
01:51:01,180 --> 01:51:06,460
update, awesome games done quick, uh, is going on. Well, it's not the awesome games done quick. It

1225
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:12,220
is actually, uh, Corona games done quick, I believe is the name of it. Um, Corona relief.

1226
01:51:12,220 --> 01:51:17,820
Thank you. Corona relief done quick is going on right now. Uh, and they're actually wrapping up.

1227
01:51:17,820 --> 01:51:22,860
I think they're on the last run they're on the, or did they finish? I think they might be completely

1228
01:51:22,860 --> 01:51:27,340
done now. It might be. Yeah. I think I was anticipating we'd be at this story by seven 30,

1229
01:51:27,340 --> 01:51:30,540
but they, uh, they're done now. It's eight o'clock. So they finished their last speed run.

1230
01:51:30,540 --> 01:51:34,300
They are done. I didn't get the final fundraising number. I was going to go to the website to get

1231
01:51:34,300 --> 01:51:37,820
the final fundraising number. Does anybody know how much they raised? It was that like

1232
01:51:38,460 --> 01:51:42,060
200,000 or something when I checked earlier today, maybe somebody in our chat knows,

1233
01:51:42,860 --> 01:51:48,940
but they, for being, um, all virtual and not being in a hotel and only being a weekend,

1234
01:51:48,940 --> 01:51:53,980
not a week. Uh, they did a pretty darn good job. Uh, so I was going to get people an update on

1235
01:51:53,980 --> 01:51:58,380
that, but unfortunately, since we got to it a little late, uh, they're done, it's over.

1236
01:51:58,380 --> 01:52:06,140
So I don't know what the, thank you orange. Right. For just over $400,000, $400,529 and 60 cents.

1237
01:52:06,140 --> 01:52:10,060
Thank you. Orange. Right. Uh, that's how much they ended up raising. So that's really good.

1238
01:52:10,060 --> 01:52:14,060
Uh, again, considering that most of them go for a week and this one was just a weekend.

1239
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:19,020
Um, that's really good. Cool. Cool. All right. And they had an exhibition with a pump it up too.

1240
01:52:19,020 --> 01:52:22,860
So that was pretty awesome. Oh, did they, I missed that. I saw a little earlier today when

1241
01:52:23,740 --> 01:52:27,340
something like that I think was the username, but, um, they did like,

1242
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:32,860
uh, a live stream of some guy playing pump it up in his room or I assume in his house.

1243
01:52:32,860 --> 01:52:35,260
That's awesome. All right. Uh, dark Sakura.

1244
01:52:37,660 --> 01:52:41,740
Well, in, uh, other news, you know how we every so often bring in some like,

1245
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:46,940
like, I'm not going to say legit, but just like the financial, you know, stuff, right.

1246
01:52:47,820 --> 01:52:54,540
You know, Bloomberg has touched on, um, on animal crossing and actually has named the game,

1247
01:52:54,540 --> 01:53:01,820
the biggest hit of the lockdown. Um, and one of their, uh, research analysts that they work with,

1248
01:53:01,820 --> 01:53:07,100
um, was saying, uh, that they have, and I'm going to read the quote. I have never seen so many

1249
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:13,580
people sharing so many screenshots of a single game on social networking sites. Um, and, uh,

1250
01:53:13,580 --> 01:53:19,420
they're actually saying that Nintendo was likely to surpass its fiscal year sales numbers, um,

1251
01:53:19,420 --> 01:53:24,780
which are going to be out on May 7th. Um, that basically, you know, we were talking last week

1252
01:53:24,780 --> 01:53:28,860
about this being like the prime time to release this game. Right. I mean, not that it was done

1253
01:53:28,860 --> 01:53:32,860
that way on purpose or that we would ever wish this, but it's just the way the cards,

1254
01:53:32,860 --> 01:53:36,620
it was a silver lining. It was a blessing in disguise. And in this case, it looks like it's

1255
01:53:36,620 --> 01:53:41,820
going to be an even bigger financial blessing for Nintendo, but, you know, again, on the personal

1256
01:53:41,820 --> 01:53:47,980
side, it's been a blessing for the players. Absolutely. So it's brought people together

1257
01:53:47,980 --> 01:53:53,100
in a way that they couldn't. And as you say, it's, it's more the mainstream financial press

1258
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:56,540
that's picking this up now. Like it's not just, we're saying, Oh, some blog is say this is,

1259
01:53:56,540 --> 01:54:00,380
you know, what investors Bloomberg has, what investors look at. And on top of that,

1260
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:05,260
isn't Bloomberg, um, more conservative leaning as well. So to hear positive things from,

1261
01:54:05,260 --> 01:54:10,460
you know, from Bloomberg about video games, their owner ran for the democratic nomination. So hard

1262
01:54:10,460 --> 01:54:16,700
to say. Yeah. I might be thinking of Forbes. Yeah. And Forbes also runs a lot of clickbait.

1263
01:54:16,700 --> 01:54:21,820
So I don't like if they run the article, I don't know. And they, yes, they're because, uh, that

1264
01:54:21,820 --> 01:54:26,300
guy ran for Republican governor once, but it doesn't matter. Uh, the reality is Forbes has

1265
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:30,860
a lot of clickbait trash on their site. Sorry. Not sorry, but that's what it is. And, um, you know,

1266
01:54:30,860 --> 01:54:36,620
this is a little more of the mainstream press. Exactly. Okay. Neat. What else?

1267
01:54:36,700 --> 01:54:43,500
Yeah. Um, well, and also, um, I don't, I really don't know anyone who is still playing this. Um,

1268
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:47,180
so I guess this is actually maybe not be a big deal, but I know a lot of people still

1269
01:54:47,180 --> 01:54:54,940
love to Pokemon rumble rush. Um, they are shutting it down on, uh, July 2nd, 2020. Um,

1270
01:54:55,740 --> 01:55:05,020
that's, uh, been confirmed by, um, uh, Saturday who, um, I believe is hold on just a second.

1271
01:55:07,020 --> 01:55:13,340
Yes. Uh, said it'd be.net, um, who basically follows a Pokemon news has, uh, got confirmation

1272
01:55:13,340 --> 01:55:20,860
on it that, um, buying, uh, the purchase of Poke diamonds in the game. Um, it has been disabled.

1273
01:55:20,860 --> 01:55:27,020
The unused diamonds in the game will be refunded when the game shuts down. So that's at 1 59 AM UTC

1274
01:55:27,020 --> 01:55:33,340
on July 2nd, 2020. That means that the game was only on the market for just over a year.

1275
01:55:33,340 --> 01:55:37,980
And I must admit, I forgot that rumble rush was even a thing. So I probably did not help

1276
01:55:37,980 --> 01:55:42,220
this situation, but, uh, sorry to those that are fans of the game. Um, but it was,

1277
01:55:42,220 --> 01:55:45,420
it was probably like, uh, when it comes to Pokemon and the mobile devices, I mean,

1278
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:50,380
Pokemon go is really, you know, the royalty thing it's, it's, it's going to be hard to compete. Any

1279
01:55:50,380 --> 01:55:55,500
other Pokemon game kind of has to compete against itself. You know, I realized they're very

1280
01:55:55,500 --> 01:56:00,860
different in how they play, but you know, there's still Pokemon, right? Yeah. And well, I mean,

1281
01:56:01,100 --> 01:56:05,580
we know what the shit is, right? Yeah. So, all right. Well, this is the part of the show where

1282
01:56:05,580 --> 01:56:11,100
we travel around the world and check out release dates. Um, I mean, cause we always have, but I

1283
01:56:11,100 --> 01:56:14,780
know it's probably a little smaller just because of what's going on in the world, but I will ask

1284
01:56:14,780 --> 01:56:20,620
anyway. Uh, Loki, do we have any U S releases this week? Uh, yeah, we have a few things. So,

1285
01:56:20,620 --> 01:56:26,700
uh, starting off, we've got Azure Striker gun volt Striker pack coming out on PlayStation four.

1286
01:56:27,420 --> 01:56:34,140
We've got, um, Boku Jaime project. That's going to be on Nintendo switch and PlayStation four,

1287
01:56:35,020 --> 01:56:42,940
Moto GP 20 on PC, Nintendo switch PlayStation four X-Box one and Stadia, uh, Picross S4 on

1288
01:56:42,940 --> 01:56:49,820
Nintendo switch. We have Naruto Shippuden ultimate Ninja storm four road to burrito.

1289
01:56:50,780 --> 01:56:57,260
Uh, it looks like predator hunting grounds on PC and PlayStation four, uh, trials of Mana on

1290
01:56:57,260 --> 01:57:03,980
PC and it's in the switch and PlayStation four. And last but not least, uh, X-Com chimera squad

1291
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:11,020
on PC. All right. Well, traveling over to Japan, boy, it was really slow in Japan last week,

1292
01:57:11,020 --> 01:57:15,020
but this week is making up for it. There's a lot of new releases. Now, uh, things are picking up

1293
01:57:15,020 --> 01:57:18,860
again again, though. I don't know how the current situation may affect some of these releases,

1294
01:57:18,860 --> 01:57:23,100
but the information we have as of today are that these games are coming out in Japan this week on

1295
01:57:23,100 --> 01:57:28,540
April 23rd on the Nintendo switch, uh, Naruto Shippuden ultimate Ninja storm four is coming

1296
01:57:28,540 --> 01:57:35,100
out this week, uh, as well as super real mahjong love two through seven. That's clearly a mahjong

1297
01:57:35,100 --> 01:57:39,500
collection of sorts is out this week. Little busters converted edition is out this week.

1298
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:43,580
Uh, that Boku Jaime project that Loki mentioned for the U S is also out in Japan this week.

1299
01:57:43,580 --> 01:57:49,500
Celeste gets a physical release, uh, in Japan this week, uh, little town hero as well. And

1300
01:57:49,500 --> 01:57:54,860
enter the Gungeon gets a Japanese release as well as Metro redo. Uh, all of this on the switch,

1301
01:57:54,860 --> 01:58:02,140
Moto GP 20. And this game sounds awesome. B simulator is out on the switch this week.

1302
01:58:02,140 --> 01:58:06,860
Is this a game that's been out over here for a while? Yeah. Oh, I got a, is it, is it good?

1303
01:58:06,860 --> 01:58:12,380
It looks really pretty for the, and it's kind of, it looks neat. I I've actually browsed it at the

1304
01:58:12,380 --> 01:58:17,020
store several times. So like, should I pick this up? But I need to look into this. Well,

1305
01:58:17,020 --> 01:58:22,540
I'm going to, I'm going to read the description, see the world through the eyes of a bee compete

1306
01:58:22,540 --> 01:58:26,460
with other bees in race. That would be kind of like, unfortunately it isn't actually showing

1307
01:58:26,460 --> 01:58:31,980
you what a bee would see, uh, compete with other bees in races, collect pollen, perform waggle

1308
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:38,140
dances and explore a world inspired by central park in New York. I had no idea B simulator was

1309
01:58:38,140 --> 01:58:43,100
a thing. Oh, the fact that's near central park and it has to do with bees reminds me it's,

1310
01:58:43,100 --> 01:58:49,580
I'm getting too many bee movie vibes. Well, that's what that was. Can you, can you narrate bee movie

1311
01:58:49,580 --> 01:58:52,940
while you play bee simulator? That's what I want to know. All right. Anyway,

1312
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:57,260
that is all good. Anything's possible. Anything's possible. Anyway, that's all on the Nintendo

1313
01:58:57,260 --> 01:59:02,620
switch. I hope, I hope it's not one of the things where it's like, it sounds awesome. And then it's,

1314
01:59:02,620 --> 01:59:07,820
it's garbage. It's shovelware. I really, my hopes are high for bee simulator. Let's just put it that

1315
01:59:07,820 --> 01:59:13,820
way. Um, and on the PlayStation four this week, also bee simulator, Celeste Boku Hime project,

1316
01:59:13,820 --> 01:59:19,820
a lot of the same games, um, Anoatsu line, uh, is out this week as well as zombie army four dead

1317
01:59:19,820 --> 01:59:26,860
war, uh, Azure striker gun volt is out this week and, uh, trials of mana, uh, coinciding with the

1318
01:59:26,860 --> 01:59:31,500
us and around the world on April 24th on the PlayStation four. And I might've missed that

1319
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:36,220
on the switch, but that should be the same on the switch as well. Yes it is. Well, it's an average

1320
01:59:36,220 --> 01:59:46,380
of 6.5 on the, uh, well 65 on Metacritic. So that's too bad. That's too bad. All right.

1321
01:59:46,380 --> 01:59:53,980
Uh, let's move on. Uh, dark soccer. How about the UK? So going on in the UK, a whopping three games

1322
01:59:53,980 --> 02:00:02,380
we have, um, on 22nd of April, MotoGP 2020 on a PlayStation, Xbox switch and PC. We have deliver

1323
02:00:02,380 --> 02:00:08,780
us the moon on, uh, the 23rd of April for PlayStation, Xbox and PC, and then on PlayStation

1324
02:00:08,780 --> 02:00:17,020
and switch on the 23rd trials of mana. That's it. All right. Sad trombone expected. It's a little

1325
02:00:17,020 --> 02:00:20,780
slow with the releases right now with everything else going on in the world. But, uh, I know even

1326
02:00:20,780 --> 02:00:24,700
if it's, even if it's getting a not so great reviews, I know a lot of people are looking

1327
02:00:24,700 --> 02:00:28,380
forward to that trials of manna. So there is that. All right. In this part of the show,

1328
02:00:28,380 --> 02:00:33,260
we would typically go to our mailbag, participate at orangelandradio.com and read the emails,

1329
02:00:33,260 --> 02:00:37,180
but I don't think we have any this week. At least last I checked, we didn't. We have no

1330
02:00:37,180 --> 02:00:43,660
none after I cleaned out the leftover face. All right. Participate at orangelandradio.com is the

1331
02:00:43,660 --> 02:00:48,620
place to send emails. If you would like to have your opinions or your, your, your thoughts read

1332
02:00:48,620 --> 02:00:56,140
on a future week's show. So we'll get back into some more news. So Loki. All right. So, um, we

1333
02:00:56,140 --> 02:01:01,500
talked about this a little bit before they, where they had a steam games festival. I want to say

1334
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:07,660
that was back in March or something, um, where it's basically a bunch of demos and whatnot

1335
02:01:07,660 --> 02:01:11,900
that are put up by independent developers. So you can check out their games. Yeah. Kind of

1336
02:01:11,900 --> 02:01:17,900
replaced GDC. If I remember, it was kind of the, the, yeah. Yeah. So, um, because we are lacking

1337
02:01:17,900 --> 02:01:23,100
an E3 this year, they're going to be doing a steam games festival summer edition from

1338
02:01:23,100 --> 02:01:28,380
June 9th through the 14th. And they have registrations up now for developers to submit

1339
02:01:28,380 --> 02:01:33,660
games for that as well. Um, so it could be, you know, limited time demos, short playable

1340
02:01:33,660 --> 02:01:38,300
experiences, uh, allows you to actually, you know, connect with developers and whatnot.

1341
02:01:38,940 --> 02:01:43,660
Plus you can wishlist any of the games that you see there. So, uh, that's pretty cool. I didn't

1342
02:01:43,660 --> 02:01:48,540
get a chance to check it out last time during GDC. So I'm hoping that this time I can actually play

1343
02:01:48,540 --> 02:01:53,740
some of these things, uh, because there were some that were mixed in there for the GDC one that,

1344
02:01:53,740 --> 02:01:57,340
um, were actually games I was looking forward to checking out. So we'll have to see.

1345
02:01:58,780 --> 02:02:03,260
Yeah. I love the idea of a virtual expo that we can all participate in. If nothing else,

1346
02:02:03,260 --> 02:02:06,860
um, I'm sure it'll be primarily a lot of indie titles, but there's a lot of great

1347
02:02:06,860 --> 02:02:13,420
indie titles. So why not? It'll be a really good thing. So, uh, and, uh, Jeff Keeley being involved

1348
02:02:13,420 --> 02:02:19,980
it's interesting too. So, yeah, we'll see how that goes. All right. Uh, moving on talking about,

1349
02:02:19,980 --> 02:02:24,060
uh, you know, earlier I talked about how Japan is making Nintendo switches again,

1350
02:02:24,060 --> 02:02:29,580
and it does seem like everywhere Nintendo switch is having a shortage and, uh, bots apparently

1351
02:02:29,580 --> 02:02:33,420
are to blame for some of this. This was something that was linked in our discord server, actually.

1352
02:02:33,420 --> 02:02:38,780
So thank you guys for sharing the story over at vognetwork.com slash discord, where we do pull

1353
02:02:38,780 --> 02:02:44,300
some of our stories from, uh, what you guys want to hear about. Um, so there's actually the story

1354
02:02:44,300 --> 02:02:48,780
that vice, uh, was running with. That's talking about how there is a bot out there that was built

1355
02:02:48,780 --> 02:02:55,020
for discord, uh, that somebody built, uh, that really it wasn't originally built for the switch

1356
02:02:55,020 --> 02:02:58,700
because there's all these other like markets where they try to buy things up and resell them.

1357
02:02:58,700 --> 02:03:04,060
Sneakers is what this was really made for. Um, but the switch seemed like a opportune market.

1358
02:03:04,060 --> 02:03:08,620
So it was used, uh, for this as well. And of course, uh, in this day and age,

1359
02:03:08,620 --> 02:03:12,940
a lot of folks are, uh, looking for Nintendo switches to help

1360
02:03:12,940 --> 02:03:18,860
fill time with kids around and not a lot to do at home outside of virtual studies.

1361
02:03:18,860 --> 02:03:23,660
So it's kind of driving up the demand for a switch. So resellers are looking to make a quick buck.

1362
02:03:23,660 --> 02:03:30,540
Um, obviously the easiest way to stop resellers for being successful would be to stop buying.

1363
02:03:30,540 --> 02:03:36,540
But I think the reality is you have a lot of families, uh, that don't understand and that

1364
02:03:36,540 --> 02:03:41,100
are just like, I need this. So I'm going to spend all this money because maybe they have

1365
02:03:41,100 --> 02:03:45,740
more disposable money to then turn around to these people who are flipping these things.

1366
02:03:45,740 --> 02:03:51,660
And there's a discord bot that is actually running a lot of this, uh, where they, you can actually

1367
02:03:51,660 --> 02:03:57,580
buy through discord and it kind of does a lot of the process for you so that you don't have to like

1368
02:03:57,580 --> 02:04:01,980
go in and fill out your address and all that stuff by hand. These bots are kind of tailored

1369
02:04:01,980 --> 02:04:07,420
to the websites to move them, move through them for you. Um, I would wish that these retailers

1370
02:04:07,420 --> 02:04:11,740
would limit how many of this stuff you can buy. And I imagine they probably do. And there's

1371
02:04:11,740 --> 02:04:16,140
probably ways that these guys have worked around that as well. So I don't want to say like, Oh,

1372
02:04:16,140 --> 02:04:20,220
they haven't thought of it because I'm sure a lot of these retailers are trying to think of ways to

1373
02:04:20,220 --> 02:04:24,780
combat this as well. Cause the reselling market doesn't always look good for them either. Um,

1374
02:04:24,780 --> 02:04:30,460
but the reality is it hasn't happened yet. Um, but what I think is just crazy about this and also

1375
02:04:30,460 --> 02:04:35,740
kind of sad is that what's happening in the discord server, people are trying to capitalize

1376
02:04:35,740 --> 02:04:40,700
on the stimulus payments that just went out this week. Uh, one apparent reseller in the discord

1377
02:04:40,700 --> 02:04:45,180
said quote, yeah, mine are taking so long to deliver. I want them to hurry up while everyone

1378
02:04:45,180 --> 02:04:52,860
still has some money. So people hoping to make all that, you know, get, get that stimulus money,

1379
02:04:52,860 --> 02:05:00,060
uh, to buy upsold Nintendo switch again, obviously these folks can't be stopped.

1380
02:05:00,060 --> 02:05:05,660
They're just going to change the technology to match whatever the websites do to stop them.

1381
02:05:05,660 --> 02:05:12,220
It would be great if the stores would only allow one per address, but I also realize, you know,

1382
02:05:12,220 --> 02:05:16,540
people are probably buying them for pickup. They put them in kids' names. They have go to other

1383
02:05:16,540 --> 02:05:20,540
places. They probably have all these ideas they do to work around them. So what we really need to do

1384
02:05:20,540 --> 02:05:25,500
is stop supporting the resale market because that's ultimately what's going to dry it up.

1385
02:05:25,500 --> 02:05:31,260
But the reality is you and me are not the ones that are driving that market up.

1386
02:05:31,900 --> 02:05:37,500
So we have to help spread the word that the, thank you, that the reasons are Alan just for the,

1387
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:41,740
on the podcast, Alan just brought me a drink. Thank you. Um, oh wait, they're not paying for

1388
02:05:41,740 --> 02:05:46,140
advertisement. Why am I putting their label forward? Um, here, look at the nutrition facts.

1389
02:05:46,140 --> 02:05:52,060
Um, so, uh, yeah, we have to stop supporting the resale market and then they'll stop doing this.

1390
02:05:52,060 --> 02:06:01,500
But until then, this is unfortunately part of it. So anyway, let's move on. Hopefully you're to

1391
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:05,100
happier news. Actually. Yes. I think this story is very cool. Dark Sakura.

1392
02:06:06,380 --> 02:06:13,020
Yeah. So, um, and now it is kind of hit or miss cool in my opinion. And I'll tell you

1393
02:06:13,100 --> 02:06:20,300
after I've announced it. So, um, the Getty, um, as in the Getty center, um, you know, art,

1394
02:06:20,300 --> 02:06:25,820
all of that, um, basically they have a tool, um, called the animal crossing art generator,

1395
02:06:25,820 --> 02:06:31,500
which you can pick out one of your favorite works of art, crop it down and auto-generated QR code

1396
02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:35,980
that you can use in new horizons using the switch online mobile, uh, tool, you know,

1397
02:06:35,980 --> 02:06:40,540
using the switch online tool. And it's pretty cool. So you can get it through your milk link.

1398
02:06:40,540 --> 02:06:48,780
Um, now the one thing that I do not like, um, is that it really isn't very clear at all. Um,

1399
02:06:49,580 --> 02:06:53,580
it looks like blurs on the wall, really. So, I mean, you get the concept of the art way. I mean,

1400
02:06:53,580 --> 02:06:57,340
and then again, it is pretty neat, you know, it's a great thing. I think that I used, um,

1401
02:06:57,340 --> 02:07:02,620
the pattern maker tool in conjunction with this one. Um, and they also have like their full step

1402
02:07:02,620 --> 02:07:06,460
by step walkthrough on how to get you through that for people who haven't done this before.

1403
02:07:07,340 --> 02:07:15,180
Um, but really, um, it's a good way for people to, I guess, expose more, more natural art out

1404
02:07:15,180 --> 02:07:21,020
there. Now I did open up and take a look through the Getty museums, um, uh, art generator.

1405
02:07:21,020 --> 02:07:25,180
They didn't have any of the artists that I was interested in. I like, I looked for Frida Kahlo.

1406
02:07:25,180 --> 02:07:32,380
I looked for Banksy. I looked for some more, uh, you know, uh, uh, crap. What was her name? Uh,

1407
02:07:32,380 --> 02:07:37,580
Hannah, I always forget her name, but she actually was, um, one of the Weimar Bauhaus.

1408
02:07:37,580 --> 02:07:40,860
I could see if there's Mondrian, that would probably translate very well. Um,

1409
02:07:41,660 --> 02:07:46,620
but I mean, the thing is that, um, it's a good way to expose, uh, people to art, to have some

1410
02:07:46,620 --> 02:07:51,500
fine pieces of art in their own museum. There's no Mondrian. That's sad. Yeah. It is kind of a

1411
02:07:51,500 --> 02:07:56,940
limited, uh, search on here, but it is still pretty cool. It just doesn't come out very cleanly,

1412
02:07:56,940 --> 02:08:02,140
if that makes sense. Yeah. Um, and you know, I know some folks might be thinking, Oh God,

1413
02:08:02,140 --> 02:08:06,300
another animal crossing story. But I mean, this is like, when you have a museum,

1414
02:08:07,900 --> 02:08:12,940
well, and then when you have a museum embracing that part of pop culture to try to get more people

1415
02:08:12,940 --> 02:08:16,940
interested in what the museum does, the art, I kind of think that's extremely newsworthy.

1416
02:08:16,940 --> 02:08:21,980
Don't you? Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. And especially to the links, like the fact that

1417
02:08:21,980 --> 02:08:26,380
they are, it's not just like, Oh, T he, somebody set up a fit. It's like, no, the museum is

1418
02:08:26,780 --> 02:08:32,540
getting these QR codes for you to put in your town. And yeah, I mean, the QR code stuff is

1419
02:08:32,540 --> 02:08:38,300
limited. Like I have a picture of Mr. Smoosh in Smoosh land, but, um, and when you see it,

1420
02:08:38,300 --> 02:08:42,460
it's grainy and it's not that great, but it gets the point across. And I think that's what this is

1421
02:08:42,460 --> 02:08:49,020
for too. If it starts a conversation about art, then it's a win. Right. So I think it's pretty

1422
02:08:49,020 --> 02:08:54,380
cool, but yeah, probably, probably very limited on what they have the rights to reproduce in this

1423
02:08:54,380 --> 02:08:58,860
manner. Um, although it would be cool to, you know, a lot of that stuff that you're talking

1424
02:08:58,860 --> 02:09:03,500
about would be very cool. Um, Marissa, uh, Marissa's in our chat. It's so good to see you

1425
02:09:04,380 --> 02:09:08,220
saying, uh, you could probably get an idea of what would be available by checking out the Getty

1426
02:09:08,220 --> 02:09:13,260
museum collections online. Yeah. And then, you know, if it drives you to their website to get

1427
02:09:13,260 --> 02:09:17,900
these QR codes, then you're exploring the museum in a sense, or you're thinking about, Oh, maybe

1428
02:09:17,900 --> 02:09:23,180
I want to see this art in real life and all that good stuff. Yeah, exactly. So win, win all around,

1429
02:09:23,180 --> 02:09:27,420
especially when museums are probably hurting right now because they don't have foot traffic.

1430
02:09:27,420 --> 02:09:32,780
So, yeah. Anyway. All right, moving on, uh, just a few more stories and then, uh, we'll take a

1431
02:09:32,780 --> 02:09:39,500
listener round table questions in our chat room. Uh, let's move on to Loki. Yes. So, uh, one of the

1432
02:09:39,500 --> 02:09:44,860
things, I mean, we've been all waiting for the Minecraft, you know, uh, fancy graphics pack to

1433
02:09:44,860 --> 02:09:50,620
come out. And unfortunately, since, um, the 4k texture pack that was supposed to be coming out

1434
02:09:50,620 --> 02:09:54,380
Xbox one and PlayStation four, I think we're just Xbox one and PC at one point,

1435
02:09:54,940 --> 02:10:01,580
uh, got canceled. We had to kind of wait for the whole, uh, Minecraft RTX, um,

1436
02:10:02,460 --> 02:10:08,380
update to be coming out to actually add real ray tracing to the game. And so now they have that in

1437
02:10:08,380 --> 02:10:16,140
beta as well to actually check it out. So if you opt in through the, um, Xbox, uh, beta program

1438
02:10:16,140 --> 02:10:24,140
and actually get the, uh, Minecraft with RTX and happen to have a computer with an RTX, uh, GPU,

1439
02:10:24,140 --> 02:10:30,380
so, uh, RTX 2060 through 2080, uh, then you can actually check this game out. Um, they also,

1440
02:10:31,260 --> 02:10:36,540
what's unique about it though is because they're changing the way the graphics are set up in the

1441
02:10:36,540 --> 02:10:42,700
game, all the textures, um, they only have specific texture packs and maps that work with it right

1442
02:10:42,700 --> 02:10:50,380
now. So you, those are being offered for free as well. I happen to have a PC that can run RTX. And

1443
02:10:50,380 --> 02:11:00,060
so I did get to check that out this week. Well, lucky you, cause I don't, it, it looks really

1444
02:11:00,060 --> 02:11:07,500
cool. I mean, it really does look like a different game. Um, it's, it's interesting though, like some

1445
02:11:07,500 --> 02:11:13,260
of the, like just everything they have there, like the atmospheric lighting that's in there now

1446
02:11:13,260 --> 02:11:18,140
is just pretty incredible. Like if you actually go and try to go down into caves and stuff like that

1447
02:11:18,140 --> 02:11:25,020
with torches, like it doesn't illuminate very much and it gets extremely pitch black and, um, they

1448
02:11:25,020 --> 02:11:30,060
have surfaces now they can set up like mirrors. I mean, you, if you're swimming under water,

1449
02:11:30,060 --> 02:11:35,900
you see the reflection of everything under the water and the top of the water or the surface.

1450
02:11:35,900 --> 02:11:43,420
Um, just some incredible looking, um, graphics there, the god rays and everything. Um, and

1451
02:11:43,420 --> 02:11:48,460
actually runs pretty good on my laptop. So that's pretty cool. Um, you have to show it to me when

1452
02:11:48,460 --> 02:11:53,980
we can hang out again. Yes. Yes. I'll have to do that. Um, I did end up uninstalling it after I

1453
02:11:53,980 --> 02:11:58,460
played through for a little bit because it's not compatible with my realms and everything,

1454
02:11:58,460 --> 02:12:04,220
uh, because it's beta, but it's pretty cool. There were some glitches I ran into at one point where

1455
02:12:04,220 --> 02:12:09,980
stuff, uh, stop drawing in a little bit. So obviously it's in beta and they're working on

1456
02:12:09,980 --> 02:12:14,220
it, but it looks incredible. Like if this is something that maybe can be supported with the

1457
02:12:14,220 --> 02:12:19,020
next generation of consoles, I mean, I think people are going to be having a pretty good

1458
02:12:19,020 --> 02:12:24,940
time with it. So, um, definitely check it out. If you own Minecraft on PC and can get into this

1459
02:12:24,940 --> 02:12:28,860
beta program, which is pretty easy to do. I was going to say I was really f*****g bitter

1460
02:12:28,860 --> 02:12:33,100
that the super duper graphics pack kind of got scrapped. And then this came out instead

1461
02:12:33,100 --> 02:12:40,700
for a $500 graphics card that I don't own, but, um, it does seem very logical that the PC folks

1462
02:12:40,700 --> 02:12:45,020
and the folks playing this right now are the beta test crowd. And that where this is ultimately

1463
02:12:45,020 --> 02:12:50,860
going to end up is on the next X-Box and presumably PlayStation five. I mean, yes,

1464
02:12:50,860 --> 02:12:56,700
Minecraft is a Microsoft product, but they still kind of put stuff on switch and Sony. So, I mean,

1465
02:12:56,700 --> 02:13:00,220
assumably it'll be there too. It'd probably just come out later for PlayStation, but yeah,

1466
02:13:00,220 --> 02:13:04,700
they're going to have, I don't know if it would necessarily work on those consoles because their

1467
02:13:04,700 --> 02:13:12,300
GPU's are based around the ATI technology. So, uh, it's hard to say, or it's ATI is kind of

1468
02:13:12,300 --> 02:13:18,700
antiquated AMD technology, but, um, I, I would be interested to see if they can adapt it for that,

1469
02:13:18,700 --> 02:13:22,940
but like if they still have the groundwork for the stuff, then maybe it'll work or it'll come up.

1470
02:13:24,940 --> 02:13:28,220
Yeah. Cause when I heard it was like Ray tracing, I was like, Oh, well that's where the next,

1471
02:13:28,220 --> 02:13:31,580
that's what they keep talking about for the next series of consoles. So that seems like the logical

1472
02:13:31,580 --> 02:13:36,940
progression, but okay. Maybe not so easy then. Interesting. Okay. Bobby says in chat, uh, by

1473
02:13:36,940 --> 02:13:41,660
Blackwell says hardware Ray tracing is hardware Ray tracing the ATI cards will have it. They'll

1474
02:13:41,660 --> 02:13:47,980
just have to port it. So it won't be such a, maybe like easy type of transition, you know,

1475
02:13:47,980 --> 02:13:52,540
hopefully not too bad, but we'll see. All right. Yeah. I could, I could see support for it at some

1476
02:13:52,540 --> 02:13:58,940
point. All right. Lastly, but not leastly tonight, this is a story. What like, honestly,

1477
02:13:58,940 --> 02:14:03,100
what the fuck is going on with cookie mama? That is, that is what we're calling this segment.

1478
02:14:03,100 --> 02:14:07,740
What the fuck is going on with cookie mama? Because like there have been stories all over

1479
02:14:07,740 --> 02:14:13,900
the internet about cooking mama and it's, uh, that the, the cooking mama is mining Bitcoin.

1480
02:14:13,900 --> 02:14:19,180
Remember that one that was around like two weeks ago. Um, yeah, it's just a mess. And apparently,

1481
02:14:19,580 --> 02:14:25,020
mama, mama can't even fix her own damn game. Um, there's issues going on with cooking mama cook

1482
02:14:25,020 --> 02:14:31,180
star is the actual name of the game that just came out for switch. Well, sort of, um, the game's

1483
02:14:31,180 --> 02:14:36,860
license holder and the publisher are fighting online about who is controlling this. The original

1484
02:14:36,860 --> 02:14:43,580
developer of the DS game office create licensed cook star to planet entertainment in 2018.

1485
02:14:43,580 --> 02:14:48,140
Uh, they decided together on a game design and then it came out on the Nintendo switch in March

1486
02:14:48,140 --> 02:14:53,100
and then was pulled from the shelves because office create said it failed to meet the

1487
02:14:53,100 --> 02:14:57,580
standards its customers expect and deserve. So I guess it wasn't really mining Bitcoin.

1488
02:14:57,580 --> 02:15:03,820
It was just bad. So I don't know. Um, so what I understand, like I watched like a video of like,

1489
02:15:03,820 --> 02:15:07,420
what, what happened with that? Oh, did a YouTuber explain it in three hours?

1490
02:15:08,460 --> 02:15:12,940
No, there's, so there's this, um, there's a channel that I watched that they did explain.

1491
02:15:12,940 --> 02:15:16,700
It wasn't three hours. It was like a pretty short video, but they explained that, um,

1492
02:15:16,700 --> 02:15:21,500
the guy that works for that publishing company doesn't even really understand what Bitcoin is.

1493
02:15:21,500 --> 02:15:27,980
They just thought they'd drop blockchain in there that that would entice people cause it's tech and

1494
02:15:27,980 --> 02:15:32,460
everybody's talking about blockchain nowadays. I am sorry. I love this comment too much from

1495
02:15:32,460 --> 02:15:37,180
our chat. See a Tiberian chat says I was hoping it would be an accounting conspiracy. So it would

1496
02:15:37,180 --> 02:15:48,140
be cooking, cooking mama's books. Uh, funny. That's great. Uh, all right. Anyway, uh, yeah.

1497
02:15:48,140 --> 02:15:52,300
And Bobby Bakloff says, yes, same blockchain gets you investor funding. It sure does.

1498
02:15:52,300 --> 02:15:58,540
Uh, so anyway, office create is now saying legal action against planet is probably going to happen

1499
02:15:58,540 --> 02:16:05,660
to protect its customers. Uh, but planet doesn't give a fuck. They said on the official cook star

1500
02:16:05,660 --> 02:16:10,540
Twitter, uh, said that the issue has to do with creative differences. There is no active

1501
02:16:10,540 --> 02:16:15,100
litigation or ruling that prevents planet from publishing this game. Um, it may still come out

1502
02:16:15,100 --> 02:16:20,140
on the switch. This game is already turning into a huge collector's item, uh, for people to find

1503
02:16:20,140 --> 02:16:29,980
and so forth. Uh, this is crazy. So, wow. But anyway, cooking mama may not be the mama you

1504
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:34,860
remember. Did you want to say something to me? No, I'm sorry. I didn't realize my mic wasn't

1505
02:16:34,860 --> 02:16:42,140
muted or typing what I was because I was, I was, uh, trying to do a, a, a well thought out

1506
02:16:42,140 --> 02:16:47,260
reply on actually something very similar. Um, Oh, see, there it went. Yeah. I am so sorry. I

1507
02:16:47,260 --> 02:16:53,180
didn't mean to just clack away cause that, that ain't me. Um, but anyway, um, I'm just like,

1508
02:16:53,740 --> 02:17:00,060
I keep thinking mama ain't fixing shit. You're going to have to fix this one for

1509
02:17:00,060 --> 02:17:07,980
your dance. Her wine break slam, you know, to quote, uh, that line by the, uh, uh, late great,

1510
02:17:07,980 --> 02:17:14,140
uh, now I can't think of her name, uh, be Arthur mama's on a cruise ship and she's stuck.

1511
02:17:14,140 --> 02:17:20,940
So mama's on a cruise ship with the COVID. Okay. Don't joke about that. All right. So

1512
02:17:20,940 --> 02:17:26,220
I'm not, well I am, but I'm also really mad at the cruise industry. So there's that. Um,

1513
02:17:27,020 --> 02:17:32,860
but, um, but I mean the thing is, is that it is a shit show from the beginning and

1514
02:17:34,380 --> 02:17:39,500
people are going to say what they're going to say. You know, the truth is there somewhere.

1515
02:17:39,500 --> 02:17:42,380
No, one's going to care what it is cause they still want to only believe what they want to

1516
02:17:42,380 --> 02:17:48,300
think. End of story. All right. Well let's, what is Mr. Smush? Can you, is that getting picked up

1517
02:17:48,300 --> 02:17:54,700
by the mic? Mr. Smush is like screaming over there. Yeah. Oh boy. All right. Anyway, uh,

1518
02:17:54,780 --> 02:17:58,460
let's move on. That was actually our last story that we have planned for tonight. So we're going

1519
02:17:58,460 --> 02:18:03,660
to open up the listener round table via our chat room over at twitch.tv slash a VOG network. So if

1520
02:18:03,660 --> 02:18:08,860
you have a question or something you want to ask on the show, uh, please go ahead and ask in the

1521
02:18:08,860 --> 02:18:14,300
chat and we'll get to it. Um, and yeah, everybody in chat is screaming about Mr. Smoosh. Yes.

1522
02:18:14,300 --> 02:18:20,380
So she wants to say something. I know he always, okay. He always does this after he uses the

1523
02:18:20,380 --> 02:18:28,220
litter box. Like he has to announce to the entire household. Exactly. Like, and that is what just

1524
02:18:28,220 --> 02:18:33,660
happened. I heard scratching noises and then I heard like now he's screaming. He doesn't have

1525
02:18:33,660 --> 02:18:38,540
a problem with his butt. I hope not. Um, I it's, it's kind of hard to say cause we can't really

1526
02:18:38,540 --> 02:18:42,860
take him to the vet or anything right now, but everything's normal in the litter box

1527
02:18:42,860 --> 02:18:47,020
in that department. So I don't think it's anything like that, but it's just catism.

1528
02:18:47,020 --> 02:18:51,580
My cat does the same thing. Every time she sees me, she screams at me every time.

1529
02:18:51,580 --> 02:18:55,260
Well, Midna's thing is that no matter if it's food time or not, she's still going to follow

1530
02:18:55,260 --> 02:19:00,060
you into that front bathroom. Cause that's where we feed her. And now Mr. Smoosh is just lying on

1531
02:19:00,060 --> 02:19:05,020
the kitchen floor. Like his entire world has ended because I guess he wants more food. So I don't

1532
02:19:05,020 --> 02:19:10,460
know. He just ate everybody. You know what I did today, Rob? Hmm. What's that? You know, I had

1533
02:19:10,460 --> 02:19:18,300
sashimi for dinner. Yes. Midna has had her first taste of sashimi. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. We, uh, Alan

1534
02:19:18,300 --> 02:19:23,100
feeds the cat all the time, all the time. Like just, just a little bit of human food, just a

1535
02:19:23,100 --> 02:19:27,100
little bit. And you know, appropriately like, you know, he, he, he's very good at taking care of

1536
02:19:27,100 --> 02:19:32,060
kitties. But like, for example, last night we tried a new barbecue place that we'd never had before

1537
02:19:32,060 --> 02:19:38,060
we did, uh, it was our date night. So we did, you know, delivery food and, um, we had a new bar,

1538
02:19:38,060 --> 02:19:42,860
like a local barbecue place we'd never had before. And, uh, Mr. Smoosh got to have just

1539
02:19:42,860 --> 02:19:47,660
a little bit, just a little bit of the barbecue chicken, just a little bit. So, but that's why

1540
02:19:47,660 --> 02:19:53,660
Mr. Smoosh is more chonk than he was when we, uh, adopted him as a rescue kitty. He was very skinny

1541
02:19:53,660 --> 02:20:00,380
then. Now he's chonk. I gave him Midna cheese a year ago and now she has like cheese radar. She

1542
02:20:00,380 --> 02:20:06,780
knows when it's actually cheese that's coming out, but she was all about the sushi, the sashimi.

1543
02:20:06,780 --> 02:20:12,220
Cause I can't have a lot of rice, even though I love rice. Um, so I just, Dan's like, get what

1544
02:20:12,220 --> 02:20:16,780
you want for your birthday dinner. And I'm like, sashimi. And so I gave Midna, eventually ate a

1545
02:20:16,780 --> 02:20:23,180
whole slice, like a whole ounce of fish. Uh, a question from DJ Rama S in our chat room. Uh,

1546
02:20:23,180 --> 02:20:29,340
what is the quarantine drink of choice right now? Mine is Tito's vodka and Pepsi cause Rite Aid was

1547
02:20:29,340 --> 02:20:36,620
out of Coke. Um, I don't do a lot of alcoholic drinking really. Um, but, um, we've been drinking

1548
02:20:36,620 --> 02:20:42,060
a lot more soda, which is bad because we're drinking like diet soda and Coke Zero and stuff

1549
02:20:42,060 --> 02:20:47,980
like, and I fully admit it's trash. We shouldn't be drinking them, but you want comfort food right

1550
02:20:47,980 --> 02:20:52,860
now in this whole circumstance. And I will say again, I guess I'm giving free advertising,

1551
02:20:52,860 --> 02:20:57,260
but it is what it is. Diet Coke has these different flavors right now that are really

1552
02:20:57,260 --> 02:21:02,220
good. Like they have a blood orange diet Coke. Um, and I love that one. It was weird to me.

1553
02:21:02,220 --> 02:21:05,900
I love that one, but I also really love the ginger lime and that's what we have,

1554
02:21:05,900 --> 02:21:12,620
um, a ton of right now. So, and Alan really likes the, um, orange vanilla Coke Zero. So there's a

1555
02:21:12,620 --> 02:21:18,700
lot of like diet Coke, terrible products in our house. Um, but which is weird because I'm usually

1556
02:21:18,700 --> 02:21:23,820
a Pepsi person. So if it's, if it's non diet, I prefer Pepsi, but if it's diet, I prefer Coke.

1557
02:21:23,820 --> 02:21:30,060
Isn't that weird? But it's what it is. Yeah. Yeah. But I, um, like here though, it's been,

1558
02:21:30,060 --> 02:21:35,900
um, I really love dietary Pepsi. Um, but right now we just have diet Coke cause our diet diet

1559
02:21:35,900 --> 02:21:40,060
Coke, because that's what Dan found at seven 11, which happened to be open after nine. Everything

1560
02:21:40,060 --> 02:21:46,940
else is not. Um, but, um, you know, like I said, I was gifted that bottle of, uh, Godiva chocolate

1561
02:21:46,940 --> 02:21:53,340
liquor. Um, and I forgot about my very loaded bar that I have because I kept wanting to experiment

1562
02:21:53,420 --> 02:21:58,860
with beverages after watching cocktail chemistry. So I have, you know, I have vermouth, I have gin

1563
02:21:58,860 --> 02:22:06,060
in my freezer. I have, um, the Nika coffee grain whiskey that my bestie got me for, uh, holidays.

1564
02:22:06,700 --> 02:22:12,940
Um, I have larceny, uh, bourbon, which is also really good. It's a non rye. I don't like

1565
02:22:12,940 --> 02:22:18,380
practically anything right. Um, I've also got Kraken, which makes every diet soda taste like

1566
02:22:18,380 --> 02:22:27,260
an oatmeal cookie, which is amazing. I have Tuaka. I have, um, crap. I have, um, Grand Marnier,

1567
02:22:27,260 --> 02:22:31,180
which I'm actually thinking of taking the Godiva and the Grand Marnier and make myself a chocolate

1568
02:22:31,180 --> 02:22:37,980
orange. Um, I have a creme de mint. I have creme de cacao, which I usually use baking. So I don't

1569
02:22:37,980 --> 02:22:45,660
have the best quality. Um, yeah. Um, I also have, uh, a thing, uh, I have some brandy.

1570
02:22:45,660 --> 02:22:50,540
I also have some Hennessy left a little bit of Hennessy. Um, I have a touch of a bit of

1571
02:22:50,540 --> 02:22:55,740
hypnotic left in my fridge. I have a Pinot Noir rosé. I've got like two bottles of wine. That's

1572
02:22:55,740 --> 02:23:00,940
it. Uh, let me, let me quickly read some comments from chat. Cause now you're, now you're, now you're

1573
02:23:00,940 --> 02:23:09,260
sounding like a, a Bubba gun shrimp in this and shrimp in this all your alcohol. I'm just saying

1574
02:23:09,260 --> 02:23:15,900
when I've had the, when I've had the, the wild urge, I've got to hook up. Now I have the Godiva,

1575
02:23:15,900 --> 02:23:20,060
which is what I really wanted. Marissa's in our chat saying the guava one, I think talking about

1576
02:23:20,060 --> 02:23:25,500
the diet soda is awesome. Leave me my one vice diet cancer. That's how I feel. Like, look,

1577
02:23:25,500 --> 02:23:29,500
you can sit there and tell me about how diet soda is horrible for you. And my answer is,

1578
02:23:29,500 --> 02:23:35,500
bitch, I know, but these are trying times. And if a diet soda is going to make me happy,

1579
02:23:35,500 --> 02:23:41,980
let me fucking live. Okay. Like we'll, we'll address the caking the diet soda habit after

1580
02:23:41,980 --> 02:23:46,700
we get on the other side of this. Okay. That's, that's what I'm leaving it as. Um, and then, uh,

1581
02:23:46,700 --> 02:23:51,980
there was some other comments I wanted to say here. Um, let's see, uh, Meesh in our chat says

1582
02:23:51,980 --> 02:23:56,460
our drink of choice has been chocolate Coca-Cola. Ooh, that's really good too. It's good. Chocolate

1583
02:23:56,460 --> 02:24:01,660
Coke. Yeah. Um, well there's, I, um, there's definitely chocolate Cola out there and I feel

1584
02:24:01,660 --> 02:24:06,140
like chocolate Coke is a thing. I don't know if it's something in America though,

1585
02:24:06,140 --> 02:24:10,540
you'll have to ask me where they're getting that. Now I have to tell you, I can't drink sugary Coke

1586
02:24:10,540 --> 02:24:15,340
like at all. Cause it just tastes too clean to me. But that, uh, strawberry Coke that they had

1587
02:24:15,340 --> 02:24:22,780
in Japan and the peach Coke and me who does not like peach, peach Coke was good. Uh, Ziba in chat

1588
02:24:22,780 --> 02:24:27,180
says we've been drinking a lot of different flavors of spindrift. Uh, and some folks talking

1589
02:24:27,180 --> 02:24:31,180
about Jackbox games and kind of using that to pass the time right now. A lot of people doing that on

1590
02:24:31,660 --> 02:24:36,540
Zoom. And some folks have asked if we're going to do a vog game night of sorts. And the answer is,

1591
02:24:36,540 --> 02:24:41,260
um, yeah, I guess we need to plan something like that. Don't we? Um, I still want to do the Amazon

1592
02:24:41,260 --> 02:24:46,540
watch party on my personal channel, but the selections are so limited. Like I don't know

1593
02:24:46,540 --> 02:24:52,300
what I would stream. I'm like there's old seasons of survivor, but the problem with streaming those

1594
02:24:52,300 --> 02:24:56,620
is that you kind of like already know who's going to go. So I don't know if it's as exciting, but

1595
02:24:56,620 --> 02:25:01,900
I did. I did consider old seasons of America's next top model because I don't know those as

1596
02:25:01,900 --> 02:25:07,580
well. So there would still be surprises in them. Uh, and maybe actually the actual season. I have

1597
02:25:07,580 --> 02:25:13,420
to see if they have that season that I always reference here on OLR with Tiffany with the,

1598
02:25:13,420 --> 02:25:17,340
we were rooting for you. We were all rooting for you. I feel like that should be the thing maybe

1599
02:25:17,340 --> 02:25:24,380
that I should stream if they have that season. So VG realness says, OMG bitch America's next top

1600
02:25:24,380 --> 02:25:29,020
model. I would be there for, so, okay. Maybe, maybe that's going to be the show. Maybe I'll

1601
02:25:29,020 --> 02:25:35,180
do some, uh, uh, chairside watching of the season with Tiffany on it. Was that season four?

1602
02:25:35,180 --> 02:25:39,580
Go back to the drink thing real quick. You know what is not in my house? Fucking La Croix.

1603
02:25:43,260 --> 02:25:48,540
Shit's nasty. I love it. I love it. All right. Uh, I think that's going to do it for the listener.

1604
02:25:48,540 --> 02:25:53,180
Uh, round table tonight. Thank you guys very much for the, uh, uh, comments and all that. You know,

1605
02:25:53,180 --> 02:25:56,860
you guys always make this a good time. Really appreciate you guys being here and hanging out

1606
02:25:56,860 --> 02:26:00,620
with us on a Sunday night. Um, keeping us going through these really tough times. Really

1607
02:26:00,620 --> 02:26:05,500
appreciate it. You know what we didn't do? Cause we had no emails. We didn't do drag race talk.

1608
02:26:05,500 --> 02:26:10,540
Well, cause I'm not watching drag race this season. What? Yeah, I'm not. I I'm taking a

1609
02:26:10,540 --> 02:26:12,460
drag race and I are seeing other people for a little bit.

1610
02:26:15,180 --> 02:26:18,860
We have some last minute story. Yeah, no. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What do you, what do you want to

1611
02:26:18,860 --> 02:26:24,220
say for last minute stories, Loki? Um, so let's talk a little bit about, uh, Riot Games purchasing

1612
02:26:24,220 --> 02:26:31,820
Hytale and, um, the developers of Hypixel studios, or I should say their, their developer Hypixel

1613
02:26:31,820 --> 02:26:35,900
studios. So Hytale, if you may remember, we talked about a little bit before, um,

1614
02:26:35,900 --> 02:26:42,300
it's sort of like a Minecraft game mixed with a little bit more RPG elements. Um, so it's gonna

1615
02:26:42,300 --> 02:26:50,140
be interesting and see what they do with that. Um, so that's supposed to be, um, really the game

1616
02:26:50,140 --> 02:26:55,660
is still not yet out, but it's supposed to be released sometime in 2021. Um, we talked a little

1617
02:26:55,660 --> 02:27:01,500
bit about, uh, HD rat remasters of some classic games. Well, guess what? We talked about this

1618
02:27:01,500 --> 02:27:09,500
before, but it's right around the corner now. So, um, checks quest HD is, um, going to be coming

1619
02:27:09,500 --> 02:27:16,060
out on steam. Apparently it is going to be a free to play game when it comes out as well. Oh joy.

1620
02:27:17,100 --> 02:27:20,220
If you want to, you know, check it out. Uh, it's going to be launching this summer

1621
02:27:21,500 --> 02:27:26,700
and then hard to complain about free, I guess. And checks, checks, miss checks,

1622
02:27:26,700 --> 02:27:30,220
mix is pretty good. And like, they're not even paying me to say that. So like,

1623
02:27:30,220 --> 02:27:38,380
it's just legit something I I'm craving now. Damn it. And speaking of, uh, free, uh, Sony has,

1624
02:27:38,380 --> 02:27:43,900
um, offered, um, I guess a couple of things for the folks that are staying home because of the

1625
02:27:43,900 --> 02:27:48,860
whole COVID-19 thing. So they're offering uncharted, the Nathan Drake collection and

1626
02:27:48,860 --> 02:27:54,460
journey for free on PlayStation four, regardless if you have PlayStation plus or not.

1627
02:27:54,460 --> 02:27:57,980
Somebody brought that up in chat and I forgot who I'm sorry. Somebody brought that up in chat

1628
02:27:57,980 --> 02:28:00,860
during the classic game of the week. And I was going to say something when we came back,

1629
02:28:00,860 --> 02:28:05,100
but then my brain was so fixated on F zero. I forgot, but thank you for mentioning that.

1630
02:28:05,340 --> 02:28:11,020
And, and to stress, you do not need PlayStation plus for this. They are like free for all game.

1631
02:28:11,020 --> 02:28:15,100
And of course, everybody was complaining when I, everybody, but people on Twitter who are

1632
02:28:15,100 --> 02:28:19,820
loud and annoying were complaining. Uh, would you already gave us these games? No, no. These

1633
02:28:19,820 --> 02:28:25,980
are free games for everybody. Plus or no plus. So a journey and uncharted collection. And, uh,

1634
02:28:25,980 --> 02:28:33,180
until May 1st. Right. Um, I believe it's until I just closed the page, um, May 5th.

1635
02:28:33,180 --> 02:28:36,220
Okay. Close, but go, go get them now. What are you waiting for? Go get them now.

1636
02:28:36,220 --> 02:28:41,260
Store, store.playsation.com. You can just log in right there at 8 PM Pacific. So,

1637
02:28:41,260 --> 02:28:48,540
you know, get on that. There you go. Is that it? All right. Free, free games is a good note to end

1638
02:28:48,540 --> 02:28:53,420
on a hype. Mayhem would be very proud if he's out there listening. Uh, anyhow, uh, that brings us

1639
02:28:53,420 --> 02:28:56,540
towards the end of the show. I really want to thank you guys for tuning in and listening

1640
02:28:56,540 --> 02:29:00,780
tonight. Really appreciate you guys being here. Uh, whether you were listening live over at Twitch

1641
02:29:00,780 --> 02:29:05,180
TV, where we record on Sunday night, or if you were listening on our podcast feed, which is

1642
02:29:05,180 --> 02:29:10,700
available, of course, on iTunes, Google podcasts, Spotify, pretty much all of the big places where

1643
02:29:10,700 --> 02:29:16,620
you can get podcasts, except for one. Um, you can, uh, listen to this show and leave a nice

1644
02:29:16,620 --> 02:29:20,860
review or something like that. Cause those things go a long way. Tell a friend about the show,

1645
02:29:20,860 --> 02:29:23,820
help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

1646
02:29:23,820 --> 02:29:27,900
but if the voices aren't here to put them out on air, then we don't really get to have every voice

1647
02:29:27,900 --> 02:29:33,980
now, do we? Uh, and, uh, again, for those of you that are on Twitch, an auto host of VOG Network,

1648
02:29:33,980 --> 02:29:37,340
oh my gosh, that's like the absolute best thing you could do. And we really appreciate it.

1649
02:29:37,340 --> 02:29:41,580
We also definitely appreciate all the follows, the biddies and the subs. I will get to those

1650
02:29:41,580 --> 02:29:45,260
after the show, as I always do. If you didn't already see your shout out tickle on the bottom

1651
02:29:45,260 --> 02:29:49,260
of the screen. Uh, but I just want to say an extra special thank you to all of that. Uh, really,

1652
02:29:49,260 --> 02:29:54,380
really do appreciate all of you that go the extra mile. Uh, I think we should now wrap up and start

1653
02:29:54,380 --> 02:29:59,020
to get people's final thoughts. Um, I will start my final thought. I don't usually go first. I'll

1654
02:29:59,020 --> 02:30:03,420
start with my final thought. My final thought tonight is, um, I didn't get into my discussion

1655
02:30:03,420 --> 02:30:08,460
on this because I talked about it enough on Bobby's show tonight, but I will just simply say

1656
02:30:09,340 --> 02:30:16,540
stop spreading articles around that are farming you for hate clicks. Stop sharing hate porn.

1657
02:30:17,420 --> 02:30:23,660
Start sharing nice porn. I don't know a nice way to phrase that, but we'll leave it at that. Okay.

1658
02:30:23,660 --> 02:30:29,340
Stop sharing hate porn. Start sharing just porn. All right. Anyway, uh, Loki, what's your final

1659
02:30:29,340 --> 02:30:34,860
thought tonight? My final thought is I'm hopefully going to work on my game this week. I really tried

1660
02:30:34,860 --> 02:30:43,180
to get to that point. Um, but got very distracted. So I do want to get back into the groove of

1661
02:30:43,180 --> 02:30:48,860
working. It's just, it's been hard because I don't have the routine of going to like my son's coding

1662
02:30:48,940 --> 02:30:53,660
class and sitting down and doing it once in a while. So it's, I need to get back into it.

1663
02:30:53,660 --> 02:30:59,420
And I think even more frequent, like every day if I can. All right. Uh, last but not least,

1664
02:30:59,420 --> 02:31:04,780
the one and only dark soccer. Your final thought. This is more continuous talking than I've done,

1665
02:31:04,780 --> 02:31:10,700
uh, like in a week. And I actually am feeling kind of okay. So I'm actually sitting here

1666
02:31:10,700 --> 02:31:16,220
kind of happy and I have carrot cake waiting for me. Well, I hope you had a wonderful birthday dark

1667
02:31:16,220 --> 02:31:21,100
soccer. And when we can we'll celebrate and I imagine celebration will somehow involve

1668
02:31:21,820 --> 02:31:29,580
liquor, drag queens, cheesecake. Sound good? That sounds pretty epic to me. I'm down. All

1669
02:31:29,580 --> 02:31:33,660
right. Sounds good. Uh, thank you, captain Pikachu for sitting in on cam because Loki

1670
02:31:33,660 --> 02:31:38,780
and dark soccer can't join me in studio. Uh, so, uh, thank you captain Pikachu for being here.

1671
02:31:38,780 --> 02:31:44,860
Uh, hopefully, uh, we'll get beat, get to all be in person, uh, at some point, but we'll do it

1672
02:31:44,860 --> 02:31:48,860
when the governor says it's safe to do it, um, because the governor's listening to scientists

1673
02:31:48,860 --> 02:31:56,780
and, um, scientists are awesome. Uh, stay safe, everybody. Um, you know, again, I know it's been

1674
02:31:56,780 --> 02:32:01,340
going over a month now and people are starting to go a little crazy and like wanting to, but remember

1675
02:32:01,340 --> 02:32:09,500
we're doing this for a reason. Um, stay, stay at home, play video games, pass the time, uh, Zoom,

1676
02:32:09,500 --> 02:32:17,100
Jack box, uh, visit your friends virtually MMOs, animal crossing, whatever it is, uh, hang in there.

1677
02:32:17,100 --> 02:32:21,260
We'll get to the other side of this. Just, you know, you just got to stay put for a little while

1678
02:32:21,260 --> 02:32:25,340
longer. So we'll, uh, we'll stay put and keep doing this show every Sunday for you guys. In

1679
02:32:25,340 --> 02:32:29,900
the meantime, we will see you in seven days next week. I'll finish final fantasy seven

1680
02:32:29,900 --> 02:32:33,660
remake by then. So I'm really hoping I'll have some things to say, have a wonderful week.

1681
02:32:33,660 --> 02:32:40,540
Everybody good night. You've been listening to orange lounge radio. Orange lounge radio is a
