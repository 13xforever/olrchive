7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	19000	This week, digital game sales reached an all-time high in March. Not on the news tonight, water is wet.
19000	23000	It's a safe bet that sales in April will be even higher, and also not on the news tonight, water is a liquid.
23000	28000	Stay tuned for the news you may not have already heard or guessed, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
28000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	46000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 817 of our show for this April the 26th of 2020.
46000	56000	My name is Rob Roberts with the hiccups, excuse me, sorry, and I am joined by nobody in studio because, again, we're still doing social distancing
56000	61000	like I think most people in the world are still at this point with everything going on, and I hope everybody's hanging in there okay.
61000	70000	I'm hanging here with Captain Pikachu with his giant oversized Famicom controller here in the studio because, unfortunately, my co-hosts are not able to be here in the studio with me,
70000	76000	but they are able to join me on Discord, so say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
76000	79000	I'm generally always full of Discord, you know that.
79000	83000	You are, but especially so on Sunday nights, right?
83000	86000	Yeah, because, you know, reasons.
86000	90000	And how are you hanging in there during this whole thing?
90000	95000	Well, believe it or not, I am still having the lung problem.
95000	97000	Oh, no.
97000	100000	Yeah, I was taken off work for like another week and a half.
100000	102000	Oh, wow.
102000	107000	But I'm on like some hardcore medication again, something different this time.
107000	121000	And it seems to be helping, so I go back to work tomorrow and see how it goes, but I also did get a rotation I applied for the first week I came back to work, so I'm pretty excited.
121000	123000	Well, congratulations. That's a good thing, right?
123000	126000	May the odds be ever in my favor.
126000	130000	It's like you got a birthday present from your work. That's wonderful.
130000	133000	Here, more responsibility. Enjoy.
133000	143000	Well, I hope everything went well with your birthday in light of the crazy stuff going on in the world.
143000	146000	Did you get a lot of people visiting you in Animal Crossing and leaving your presents?
146000	151000	Actually, I did. Well, only four people left me a present, sorry.
151000	156000	One person gave me money, which was great, and then I got some songs that I wanted, which is funny.
156000	159000	I wanted DJ KK, and like two days later it showed up in my store.
159000	161000	Oh, nice.
161000	164000	I was already giving it, so yay.
164000	166000	Yay?
166000	171000	But thank you, RNG, I guess.
171000	179000	Isn't that the way it goes? You go out of your way to try to get something special, and then the next day it's like, oh, it's just in your nooks or whatever, just ready to go.
179000	182000	Or as Gwen calls it, RNG-sus.
182000	186000	Yes, yes. Well, that's a term that goes way back to Final Fantasy XI for me.
186000	195000	Yeah. Well, I mean, random number generator has been a gaming thing since you could do that.
195000	200000	Since you rolled dice in the 70s, probably even before that, really, honestly.
200000	212000	But at any rate, it was great, and I have to thank Brad for the elaborate kimono stand, or is it exquisite or elaborate, one or the other.
212000	220000	But I really like it. I super wanted it, and someone bought it before I had a chance to in the game, and I was like, it was happening to me like days in a row. I was so mad.
220000	227000	And finally, two of the things I super wanted people gave to me, and I'm like, well, thank you. You are quality humans.
227000	230000	Songs will be sung about you, off key, and not by me.
230000	239000	All right. Well, I owe you at least a dinner or some other type of treat when we are allowed to see each other again, which hopefully won't be another year.
239000	243000	But hopefully in the coming months, we can at least hang out in small groups, but we'll see, right?
243000	244000	We'll see.
244000	249000	We'll see. All right. Say hello as well, joining us on Discord, to Techmaster Loki.
249000	250000	Hello.
250000	253000	Hello. Coming to us with his rock band microphone, which I still love.
253000	255000	I am, yes.
255000	259000	Do you actually play rock band with that microphone anymore?
259000	263000	I don't play rock band at all. It's all in the garage, falling apart.
263000	268000	I miss the plastic instrument days, man. Like, I know rock band four maybe wasn't quite...
268000	274000	Because, I mean, it was hard to get people to buy into rock band four when it was like, hey, we took stuff away from rock band three.
274000	277000	And now we just kind of replicated the rock band two formula.
277000	281000	And yes, I know rock band four got a lot stronger with it, expansion later on.
281000	284000	But, you know, you got to really come out the gate roaring.
284000	287000	But I miss those plastic instruments days, man. I wish...
287000	289000	Good times. Good times.
289000	292000	Yeah, I'd have to hook the Xbox 360 back up in order to play all that.
292000	297000	So, I mean, probably won't do that anytime soon.
297000	301000	Like, I know in this era of social distancing, a lot of people are doing jackbox games.
301000	304000	Like, those jackbox games are probably more popular than they ever have been.
304000	307000	And they were already pretty popular beforehand.
307000	308000	Now they're, like, super popular.
308000	315000	And I feel like if rock band had had a more recent release, we might be seeing more rock band parties virtually online.
315000	321000	But sadly, I mean, I'm sure somebody's playing it, but probably just not as many as you'd hope.
321000	323000	That'd be cool. Yeah.
323000	327000	Yeah. So, all right. Well, my co-hosts are joining me.
327000	333000	And you guys are joining me in the chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network, the voice of geeks network,
333000	338000	where we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
338000	345000	So if you are listening to our fair podcasts on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, wherever it is that you get your podcasts,
345000	349000	don't forget that you can actually join in on a live taping on Sunday nights.
349000	353000	And I know with a lot of people staying at home, as you should be right now,
353000	356000	you're probably looking for more things to do on Sunday nights.
356000	359000	So please come on over and say hello over at twitch.tv.
359000	364000	Going to the twitch chat room for some comments, Bobby Black Wolf is there saying,
364000	368000	I want them to re-release new rock band instruments because they're falling apart.
368000	373000	Oh, yeah. That's that's a big issue that happens, too, is that like old things and that's they fall apart.
373000	379000	They don't last forever. There's very few things that last forever, save for like the Atari 2600.
379000	383000	Hey, and the NES. Yeah, those those things do last.
383000	387000	Well, with the NES, though, you still have to get you have to blow on the cartridges, right?
387000	392000	Or moisten the contacts or whatever it is. No, no, no. That's just a wives tale.
392000	397000	It's just because it's the problem with that had to do with the manufacturer of the machines in the U.S.
397000	403000	when they were sort of that slot that drawer slot loader because they wouldn't hit the contacts properly.
403000	409000	That was the whole problem with you just have to reseat it on the Japanese ones.
409000	412000	That hardly ever happened, from what I understand. Well, yeah.
412000	416000	If you're lucky enough to have a top loader NES, then you didn't have that problem.
416000	422000	That's why. Lucky you. Oh, she's different.
422000	427000	But but you got to blow it before you don't know it. So, you know.
427000	432000	Wow. No, no, no, no. And oh, a zero from the French judge.
432000	436000	Wow. Loki. Wow. That that bombed. All right.
436000	441000	But well, now that all the trademarks and patents and things are expiring on hardware,
441000	445000	it's very easy to get like a third party and yes.
445000	449000	And I know some people get a little with those things because they're not the real thing,
449000	453000	but they they'll still play all your cartridges. And if you don't want to you know,
453000	458000	if you don't want to do the emulation and the high fancy things, most of them will do like a straight,
458000	464000	you know, port through. It's just it's never going to look the same because your TVs are high definition now,
464000	467000	as opposed to be used in that.
467000	471000	I don't even remember what's called coaxial cable in the back like you used to use back in the day.
471000	476000	Unless, of course. And I bet Jamie's got one of these, too. You've got a coaxial television that still works.
476000	481000	Did you hook up on your old devices, too? Yeah, we've got a Vega in the room that I'm in.
481000	487000	Yeah. And but but I mean, like the rock band hardware, those coaxial televisions
487000	491000	and things are going to give out eventually. Like you're kind of lucky that you still have a Vega that works,
491000	495000	you know, not not everybody's are going to work forever.
495000	501000	Well, and Vega are last gen, you know, for the CRT era of TVs.
501000	504000	So I'm feeling a little bit more confident about that.
504000	510000	But there are places that will still do CRT repair. They're just very special, you know,
510000	515000	like getting tires for my husband's Mustang. They don't make those tires anymore, except special order.
515000	521000	I guess that's true. There's always if there's if there's always going to be a retro audience or and it's not just for gaming,
521000	525000	but there's going to be people that want to hook up their laser disc players or, you know,
525000	532000	old media systems and things like that to their televisions. And, you know, you're only only going to be able to do that.
532000	537000	If you have a coaxial television, there's always going to be an audience for that.
537000	541000	I have a word for you. What? S-video.
541000	546000	Is that you have to is that the red, yellow, white plug plugs?
547000	553000	I would say that video was like the big one that preceded maybe HDMI.
553000	560000	Oh, the one with the circle. I think I had that for a hot minute. The PlayStation support the PlayStation one supported that, right?
560000	568000	Yeah. S-video was like the thing for a hot minute. And then, you know, but I like to think of that as what led up to HDMI.
568000	575000	I kind of agree with Bobby component was before HDMI because the component was like the five all in one.
575000	582000	Yeah, but still. But still, I remember component because my first high definition television, because remember I bought an HDTV kind of early.
582000	587000	It was in what who did we do? Was it was it when Channel three interviewed us?
587000	593000	We were playing on the Xbox and that was on my old ass HDTV that actually had like the giant back on it.
593000	597000	You could only hook up through component. You couldn't use HDMI on that thing.
597000	604000	And component was where you had like a red, a blue, a green and another red and white for the audio is like five plugs.
604000	608000	Yeah. Well, we still got stuff that hooks up that way. I mean, it's thankfully.
608000	614000	I mean, and the thing to deal with, with like conversion boxes is that you're going to deal with input lag.
614000	618000	Yeah. And that can be brutal if you're trying to play a music game.
618000	621000	That can be brutal if you're trying to play a shooter game.
621000	625000	Absolutely. A lot of games. Really. Guardian legend. Impossible.
625000	628000	Oh, that makes me sad. All right.
628000	634000	Well, the trick to the trick to combat that is you just have to be not good enough at music games in order for the input like to not matter.
634000	641000	Well, this is just normal for me. Exactly. Like I couldn't tell you there's input lag on TV,
641000	645000	on my DVR cabinet, because I'm just not good enough to be able to detect it.
645000	656000	To be fair, most music games have a sort of like calibration mode, like most anything modern really has a calibration mode.
656000	658000	So you can kind of account for a lot of that stuff.
658000	661000	But like Jamie said, like a shooter is not going to have a calibration mode.
661000	663000	You know, music games kind of had to put those in there.
663000	666000	But a lot of the other older games didn't really do that.
666000	671000	Speaking of music games quickly, before we get to our kickoff topic, I know we're talking a lot here at the top of the show,
671000	673000	but at least it's somewhat gaming related.
673000	678000	Loki, you were mentioning in chat that there's a big music game that's being given away for free right now.
678000	680000	Kind of free in quotes, right?
680000	690000	Yes. So if you are a Twitch Prime subscriber, then you can actually get it's what was it?
690000	695000	A video game musical, I believe, or old school musical. I'm sorry. Yeah. OSM.
695000	700000	The old school musical is free right now with your Twitch Prime subscription.
700000	704000	So go market for your account or whatever, because it's a great music game.
704000	707000	Actually, I finished that one and it was pretty good.
707000	711000	Yeah, Bobby did a lot of streams of that, I know. So he really liked that too.
711000	714000	And I think I played it once or twice. And it was fun. It's a good game.
714000	718000	So, hey, and you can't be free. And again, I'm using my quotey fingers.
718000	723000	I know many of you guys are Amazon Prime and therefore Twitch Prime subscribers, and you can go grab that.
723000	729000	And, you know, if you haven't used your free Twitch sub, you might also consider spending it here at VOG Network
729000	732000	and giving us the subscription here at Twitch TV.
732000	738000	And that will allow you access to the video archives where you can go back and watch all the old episodes of Orange on Trio,
738000	744000	back to when we were first doing video streaming. Same thing with Bobby Blackwolf and all the specials that we do here at the Voice of Geeks Network.
744000	751000	But, hey, even if you're just downloading the audio podcast that's free, as it always has been for almost 18 years now,
751000	754000	a big thank you to supporting the show. We appreciate it.
754000	758000	Did you see what the other free games on there are? Because I'm looking at the list right now.
758000	760000	I didn't, actually.
760000	766000	There's one called Earthlock, one called Yono and the Celestial Elephants, which just looks adorable.
766000	768000	I think I've heard of that one, yeah.
768000	771000	Kathy Rain, a detective is born.
771000	774000	Turok, an OSM, like we said.
774000	776000	Aetherborn and Light Matter.
776000	782000	So there's a lot of games right now. That's interesting because I feel like Twitch Prime kind of took a break from free games for a while,
782000	789000	and they were doing like Fortnite kits and Apex Legends kits, and it was like add-ons for a lot of other games.
789000	791000	So it's interesting that they kind of went back.
791000	796000	I mean, I don't know if that's just because of the world situation or if that was a long-time strategy of theirs anyway,
796000	798000	to go back to some of the game giveaways, but that's pretty cool.
798000	801000	It's hard to beat the price of free, right?
803000	807000	Speaking of free games, one other game I guess we should mention here,
807000	812000	because it came up quite a bit in our Discord, and I ended up tweeting about it,
812000	816000	and it's not on our show roll tonight, so I should mention as well, if you haven't grabbed it yet,
816000	824000	Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 is free right now on PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam.
824000	831000	I incorrectly tweeted that it was also on Switch for free, although the game does exist on Switch as a plus version,
831000	837000	because it is the plus version with the two-player mode, it is a separate game and therefore not part of this giveaway.
837000	840000	But again, it's hard to beat the price of free.
840000	845000	I know some people have problems with Championship Edition 2 because the whole ghosts on rails mechanic is kind of weird.
845000	850000	I don't know, I enjoy it, like if you start to memorize certain patterns and things, it can be a lot of fun,
850000	855000	and it's one of those games where you make the tiniest little screw up and it's just going to throw your score in the garbage.
855000	857000	And so for that, the challenge is kind of fun.
857000	862000	And the music, like if nothing else, download it just so you can play the soundtrack in the background,
862000	864000	because the music is outstanding.
864000	870000	So again, that's Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Steam.
870000	872000	So lots of places to grab that.
872000	877000	Alright, hey, that's a great kickoff topic is to talk about free games,
877000	882000	but let's get into talking about, well actually this is a free game as well that many people are playing,
882000	889000	and this game is such a huge cultural phenomenon that they're getting into other things as well, such as concerts.
889000	896000	And I of course am talking about Fortnite, which admittedly I don't think we the hosts of OLR play a lot of Fortnite.
896000	900000	Loki, do you play any Fortnite? I feel like if anybody's playing it, it's you and it's probably your kids, not you.
900000	907000	I haven't. I don't have time to play it, but no, my kids do it quite a bit, but I don't.
907000	910000	Okay, yeah. I have to admit, I don't play a lot of Fortnite.
910000	916000	I've tried a couple times. I at least can say I have played it, but the building mechanic throws me off,
916000	918000	and I don't know how else to explain it.
918000	923000	But I do like when they do weird stuff in Fortnite, and I'm using that in a complimentary way.
923000	927000	Like when they were debuting the new Weezer album in Fortnite,
927000	930000	I thought, this is so crazy nuts, I have to see this.
930000	934000	Like this is something Bjork would do or something. So I had to go check that out.
934000	937000	And now, I forgot about this, so I didn't go check it out.
937000	940000	But I heard a lot about it, and I'm sure many of you checked this out.
940000	947000	There was a Fortnite in-game event that happened this past week featuring Travis Scott in concert premiering a brand new track.
947000	952000	And this set an all-time record for viewers.
952000	962000	12.3 million players tuned in to view the astronomical event in Fortnite by Travis Scott.
962000	969000	And I'm sure there's archives everywhere on YouTube and Twitch streams and things like that if you want to go relive it.
969000	972000	And I think Epic Games has on their side as well.
972000	982000	And it's interesting in these here times that we live in right now where we can't get together in person to go to a concert.
982000	987000	It's interesting that we are exploring this idea of a virtual concert.
987000	1001000	This kind of led me to thinking about how video games are kind of helping to fill the void in a lot of places right now in this pandemic society that we're living in.
1001000	1004000	I don't know what else to call it. That's really what it is, a pandemic society.
1004000	1008000	And I think many of us are hoping this pandemic society isn't forever.
1008000	1017000	But we know this pandemic society is probably going to go on in some shape or form for quite some time to come, at least until there is a vaccine or cure for COVID.
1017000	1023000	Or they find a way to effectively treat COVID where people are not dying from it in such staggering numbers.
1023000	1029000	And so until those things happen, I think there will be some parts of a pandemic society still going on.
1029000	1034000	And we've already had some stories about how video games are doing this on previous episodes of the show.
1034000	1042000	For example, Final Fantasy XIV last week, we talked about the memorial for a Final Fantasy XIV player who had passed because of COVID.
1042000	1050000	And because you can't get together en masse for funerals right now, a virtual memorial is a way to do it.
1051000	1057000	Animal Crossing. There's many things going on in Animal Crossing, like weddings, maybe not a real wedding.
1057000	1064000	But maybe because somebody's wedding was supposed to take place on such and such day, they did a virtual ceremony in Animal Crossing.
1064000	1066000	We saw something along those lines within the past week.
1067000	1077000	We've had several stories in the past couple weeks about esports and how not just like, it's weird to say traditional esports,
1077000	1087000	but you know, the things we know as esports like Overwatch are filling the void of the lack of physical sports on our televisions right now.
1087000	1092000	But then we also have the physical sport players trying their hands with esports, right?
1092000	1099000	And so we've seen these like NBA, 2K, 20 playoffs with NBA players for charity and things like that.
1099000	1102000	So like video games are filling the void in that space as well.
1102000	1111000	So it's kind of fascinating to me for as much as I've grown up in my life and gamers have always been somewhat of an underdog,
1111000	1115000	at least, you know, when I was in high school and so forth, gamers, it was a niche thing.
1115000	1118000	It was a thing you had to be a nerd kind of to be into it.
1118000	1126000	But now here we are in the society that we're in, in the year 2020, and it's like video games are helping to bring us together.
1126000	1131000	And I'm kind of curious, and I'll open this to our chat room as well as my co-host,
1131000	1138000	what are some other ways that you're seeing video games specifically bringing people together in this current world?
1138000	1143000	And how do you think video games might continue to do that?
1143000	1150000	Are we going to see more virtual concerts in light of the real thing in things like Fortnite or perhaps another game?
1150000	1156000	What do you think video games are going to do for this society that we're in as the months unfold?
1156000	1162000	Do any of my co-hosts want to try to tackle that question? I know that's a long question. There's a lot to talk about.
1162000	1170000	I haven't seen, I would say, like a super bunch for video games other than the stuff that you can already do online.
1171000	1181000	You know, like, I mean, mostly what I see is the Animal Crossing stuff. I see, you know, I guess things more on that line, things that the users have done together.
1181000	1190000	But what in the bigger picture that we are seeing things like concerts and stage plays and things like that happening.
1190000	1201000	So right now, I think that we're looking at it expanding into the complete digital realm and just even into traditional arts going that way.
1201000	1208000	Yeah, I mean, you know, I still stand very much by the motion, the notion, excuse me, that video games are art.
1208000	1215000	And, you know, you're going to see that the one silver lining in this whole pandemic world is that you're going to see some really beautiful art,
1215000	1219000	the flowers that kind of grow from the fertilizer that's happening right now.
1219000	1225000	And I think there's going to be some great games that come out of it. But that doesn't just mean games.
1225000	1231000	There's going to be great songs that come from it. There's going to be great movies and television and plays and so forth.
1231000	1236000	And you're right. These other artistic industries are also challenged with how do we adapt.
1236000	1243000	And you've seen like like Broadway, my heavens, the live stage world hugely impacted by what's going on.
1243000	1246000	But you're seeing, you know, YouTube. Right. Right.
1246000	1250000	Like Andrew Lloyd Webber is putting his shows on YouTube once a week or something like that.
1250000	1256000	Which reminds me, I forgot to watch the Love Never Dies one because I was like, how bad can a sequel to Phantom of the Opera be?
1256000	1261000	And I was going to try to see if it could be that bad. But I forgot to watch because that was on Friday. Right.
1261000	1270000	So. Oh, well. But anyway, you know, you see that getting put out there and you see movies have been really kind of challenged without the traditional movie theater.
1270000	1277000	But you're seeing a lot of, you know, kind of direct to the home type of things like we've seen with the Trolls movie right onward.
1277000	1282000	It seems like a lot of family movies are kind of going that route because they know there's a lot of bored kids at home right now.
1282000	1286000	Right. They need to be entertained. So there's a lot of things going that direction.
1286000	1297000	Whereas I think the more adult films are pushing back, like the Top Gun movie will say, are pushing back until the fall because there's hopes that maybe the theaters will still come back in some type of capacity by then.
1297000	1304000	Which I, I would really hope so, even if maybe there's more social distancing and things that are involved with that.
1304000	1313000	Loki, what's your take on this question? Like, how do you think video games are going to continue to help us in this modern society that we're in now?
1313000	1321000	I'm pretty sure that they're going to keep doing this type of stuff because it's good promotion for not only Fortnite, but for whatever they're trying to promote at the same time.
1321000	1329000	I mean, they've already done concerts before in Fortnite as well. I want to say that they do like a Marshmallow concert or something like that.
1329000	1331000	Yeah. Yeah, they did.
1331000	1340000	And then, of course, they've done cross promotions with all sorts of things from Avengers to Star Wars to John Wick.
1340000	1350000	I mean, so I'm sure there's some sort of mutually beneficial relationship that they have with these advertising partners to do that in the first place.
1350000	1361000	As far as like, I mean, granted, we're going to see a lot of people turning to games like this because it's a good way to be able to socialize with folks to play stuff.
1361000	1367000	Like my kids were talking to their cousins over Zoom today, and then I think they were playing Roblox together.
1367000	1375000	So, you know, it's kind of a way to be able to socialize without going outside. So it makes sense that a free play game like this would be pretty popular.
1375000	1382000	Yeah, I keep forgetting how popular Roblox is with a younger audience. It's a huge game for tweens, really.
1382000	1383000	Those darn kids.
1383000	1388000	Those darn kids. Lots of great answers in chat. Let me get to it over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
1388000	1395000	SG100Matt says, I think we're going to see a renaissance in entertainment like how we saw after 9-11. Not in the same way necessarily.
1395000	1403000	I think there's going to be a large need for comfort games after this whole thing. I just hope that the money is there to fund these new projects.
1403000	1406000	Things have a funny way of working out sometimes. I think it'll be alright.
1406000	1413000	Mr. Rhizos in chat says, I work on a manufacturing company and not video game specific.
1413000	1419000	But with all the production lines off, we're exploring ways to introduce VR and AR to light them up again.
1419000	1423000	Interesting we're not hearing more about that, the VR and AR being used.
1423000	1428000	Maybe that has to do with the fact that, you know, not everybody has or wants a VR headset.
1428000	1434000	So maybe, you know, Fortnite, it's very easy to get that on every computer and every phone and so forth.
1434000	1443000	Might be a little harder for the VR AR stuff, but certainly if it's a tech oriented thing, then there's going to be more of a tech focused audience that has adopted that stuff.
1443000	1445000	So yeah, it's going to be very interesting.
1445000	1459000	I wonder if some technologies such as like HoloLens, a huge AR technology, you might see some of those things like a rush to adopt some of those things because of continued social distancing and what have you.
1459000	1466000	I don't know. Just theorizing. I don't know what the future holds. If I did, I'd have a lot more questions I'd want to answer.
1467000	1478000	Let's see. Fifth Dream Today in chat says, a lot of people in my local goth community, since we can't go clubbing or to shows, have been in Animal Crossing lately.
1478000	1486000	LOL. And there are huge goth Animal Crossing communities on Facebook with so much traffic right now.
1486000	1492000	I don't know why I love that image because Animal Crossing is such a cutesy little game.
1492000	1499000	And you know that the stereotypical goth, you know, is like very like, oh, it's so everything is so black and tragic.
1499000	1507000	Have you seen the glowing skull wall wallpaper and the skull fort and the skull radio and the fortune tellings set and the magic rug and all.
1507000	1512000	And the pen and paper that they give you so you can draw all your own things.
1512000	1518000	I've seen the pentagrams on the ground where people are coaxing villagers into sacrifice in game stuff.
1518000	1524000	There's like this like total like strappy leather outfit.
1524000	1529000	There's I think that there is stuff for all kinds of kink and as well in the game.
1529000	1534000	We have some we have some special designs going on that were in game.
1535000	1540000	Vinyl masks. There needs to be more owls in the game besides just blathers and Celeste,
1540000	1545000	because what other creatures are going to be out at night when all the goths are out?
1545000	1550000	Apparently, Agnes. I know I was going to say Agnes never sleeps.
1550000	1555000	OK, so I have this lady gorilla named Rocket and she always was rocket.
1555000	1559000	I like you. You do not speak bad of my rocket.
1559000	1562000	You know who I hate more than Rocket? Ed.
1562000	1566000	Yeah, and you know who I hate almost as much as Ed and I'm glad she's not in the game?
1566000	1567000	Who?
1567000	1571000	Rilla, the Hello Kitty pink gorilla annoying thing.
1571000	1574000	No, I love Rocket. You do not speak bad about Rocket.
1574000	1580000	Rocket is a female gorilla who wears like she wears bright pink lipstick and always wears pink clothing.
1580000	1582000	And I love her. She's great.
1582000	1586000	And the thing about her, she's never up before 10 a.m.
1586000	1590000	And if I, for whatever reason, I'm playing the game at like three in the morning, she's still out there doing something.
1590000	1593000	So Rocket is my town goth for sure.
1593000	1594000	Out there murdering.
1594000	1596000	Maybe. I don't know.
1598000	1606000	Anyway, I just I'm sorry. I love the fact that Animal Crossing, of all things, has gone to the goth community, which I've been to.
1606000	1615000	The worst thing about doing orange on radio when this show started, the worst thing was that I had to stop going to the goth dance night that they used to have here locally,
1615000	1620000	because I used to have a lot of fun going and people watching at those events and smoking, smoking cloves out front.
1620000	1624000	I used to go on Thursdays and then like in my workweek.
1624000	1627000	Oh, yeah. I remember when I would go with Jessica.
1627000	1631000	Yeah. No, no. The work the workweek ones ended.
1631000	1633000	The best one was when they were doing it. Sorry.
1633000	1637000	We're reminiscing about local stuff, but I don't care because this is good times.
1637000	1642000	The best one was when they did it Club 21 and it was on like a Friday or Saturday.
1642000	1645000	Oh, when they did.
1645000	1647000	I don't remember the name of it.
1647000	1650000	I thought that. No, that was the rage.
1650000	1654000	There was the rage. That was that was the Sunday one that I was just referring to.
1654000	1657000	OK. And I don't remember what they called that anymore.
1657000	1660000	But there was one asylum, the asylum. Thank you, Loki.
1660000	1667000	The asylum was the one they did at the rage hashtag things people from Sacramento will understand.
1667000	1671000	So there was the asylum. But what was the one like Club 21 did like a synthesis?
1671000	1677000	Was that what it's called? So this is something on like a Friday or Saturday, something that was the one that was that country club lanes.
1677000	1682000	Yes. I think it moved back and forth. Yes. Yeah. I've been to that one a few times.
1682000	1687000	And I also went to the one that was at, oh, gosh, it was a lesbian bar usually.
1687000	1690000	Yeah, that was the night they turned it. That was OK. That was it.
1690000	1694000	OK. Yeah. That was on Thursdays. I thought they did it on the weekend.
1694000	1696000	Maybe they moved it, but they were doing it on a Thursday.
1696000	1702000	And that's when I had that rash from taking amoxicillin that made my skin raise up looking like a spider web.
1702000	1707000	So when I went, the place that was stretched out on my skin glowed under the black light.
1707000	1710000	Because, yes, I am that pale.
1710000	1715000	There was like, well, that's great. You look so cool. Is that make them like, no, it's amoxicillin.
1715000	1719000	And then I'd go in the bathroom and rub like steroid cream all over my arm so I wouldn't scratch myself to death.
1719000	1722000	OK, so try to get somewhat back on topic.
1722000	1728000	How can video games help us relive the goth dance days of our past?
1728000	1732000	I don't know. There's all kinds of ways you can goth anything up.
1732000	1736000	I mean, I've seen people build entire like gothly neighborhoods.
1736000	1741000	And, you know, we've got everything going on in Animal Crossing. I mean, look at the old dream towns and Animal Crossing.
1741000	1745000	You remember Ica Village? I do. I do.
1745000	1751000	Yeah, I Ica Village was was the shit.
1751000	1764000	But I mean, it of course, you've got like your your general horror games, which I mean, not necessarily gothy, but some of the elements can go in.
1764000	1769000	You can see at the very says you can wear a frankenfurter hoodie in New Horizons.
1769000	1772000	The SSG 100 Matt says save your bells for Halloween.
1772000	1776000	Look, when you're goth, Halloween is every day.
1776000	1780000	That's that's that's that's what it is. When you're goth, you get to celebrate Halloween every day.
1780000	1782000	You kind of get to do that when Halloween is life.
1782000	1787000	You get to do that as well when you're gay. And that's why there's so much crossover, just so you know.
1787000	1791000	And to tell Derek Tetsuya, KK does have KK Durge. Just saying.
1791000	1796000	Yes. Yes. KK Durge. I have KK Durge. It was like the second song I got.
1796000	1801000	I don't have it yet, but I can order it for you. Thank you.
1801000	1805000	I do also have my DJ KK. So I get my Eurobeat on in my basement.
1805000	1812000	All right. It sounds like we need to transition into our gaming weeks, but I thought we could talk a little bit about how gaming might help the future.
1812000	1817000	Or we could just take a look back in the past, which is what we did a little bit there at the end. But that's OK.
1817000	1822000	Rob, what? There is no future. There is only now. Only Zool.
1822000	1830000	All right. Anyhow, let's go back to our gaming weeks and talk a little bit about the types of games that we have been playing this week.
1830000	1833000	Dark Sakura, how was Animal Crossing?
1833000	1845000	Ten hours of Animal Crossing a day, pretty much. I mean, and it's more like I'll leave the game on and go walk out, you know, and then I will go water my vegetables because I have an apocalypse garden.
1845000	1849000	Three of my carrots are surviving. It's really awesome.
1849000	1861000	Yes, from death comes life. But anyway, I'm also I started to play Pokemon because I decided that I was going to see how my lungs were doing and try to take a walk.
1861000	1866000	My normal little just quick neighborhood jaunt, like, you know, maybe half a mile.
1866000	1872000	I made it a fifth of a mile and came inside and heaved.
1872000	1877000	So no Pokemon happened. And that was really it.
1877000	1880000	We still haven't started Final Fantasy seven yet.
1880000	1885000	It's just been Animal Crossing like I'll even tell Dan, hey, why don't we start Final Fantasy?
1885000	1893000	He's like, let me do this Animal Crossing first. And then before you know it, he built Teacup Park in Animal Crossing.
1893000	1898000	Did you see Teacup Park? No. Have you collected all the Teacup rides? We only have one.
1898000	1902000	Oh, I'm sorry. I have three of the four. I'm missing one. Other people have to order them for you.
1902000	1909000	Yeah, I traded a lighthouse because one of my friends got the yellow lighthouse by default and she was like, I got that one, too.
1909000	1915000	Well, if you want just a plain white lighthouse, I'm open to giving you one. So I gave me a red and white one.
1915000	1920000	OK, cool. I traded for that. And then somebody just gave me a black the black checkerboard one.
1920000	1925000	So the only teacup ride I need to have all four is like the pastel one. There's like a very pastel looking one.
1925000	1930000	I have the red and blue one. The like the mostly red bold.
1930000	1934000	Actually, I don't know which one I have. Maybe I have the pastel. I'll have to let you look at it.
1934000	1940000	But yeah, Dan. Well, we have. OK, so here's the story. And this is going to lead up to a joke now that we have in our village.
1940000	1947000	So when I moved my orange grove to the south west section under where Dan's little plateau is,
1947000	1951000	where he built his house and his redneck kiddie pool and everything.
1951000	1956000	And so Dan's like, I'm going to build a Disneyland.
1956000	1959000	I'm like, with what? We only have teacups. Like, we'll do it with teacups.
1959000	1965000	So he uproots all of the orange trees and moves them around and builds Teacup Park.
1965000	1970000	And that's where I made that little QR sign that I like to do so that we can sign for Teacup Park.
1970000	1974000	So and Marissa gave me lights. I have green lights. We're doing all this crap to it.
1974000	1980000	It looks great and everything. And of course, Dan has it roped off because, you know, Disneyland is closed down.
1980000	1984000	So earlier today, he was like, yeah, we have all these sections.
1984000	1990000	So you built Teacup Park for nobody to visit? Well, you can look at it.
1990000	1999000	It's not on. That sounds like that South Park episode where Cartman buys the amusement park so no one else can go to it but him.
1999000	2008000	Yeah, well, that's that's Teacup Park. So anyway, Dan's like talking about all the places that we have in in our island because I built this.
2008000	2013000	I built a Japanese cemetery, sea goth.
2013000	2019000	I moved all of my non-native fruit to, you know, a little four by four orchard.
2019000	2024000	I made like a little botanical garden with all of the flowers I have any idea what the fuck to do with.
2024000	2031000	You know, I've got like the the the flower garden, you know, the breeding area for my flowers.
2031000	2039000	We have the town center. Dan has his house in Redneck Land. And then he says, and then we have Anaheim.
2039000	2044000	Is he uprooted the orange trees to build a theme park? Yes. Perfect. Perfect.
2044000	2050000	So so now it's just called Anaheim, apparently. You'll have to rename your town.
2050000	2055000	I'm not renaming my town. I know. All right. Anything else?
2056000	2062000	I wouldn't rename it Anaheim anyway. All right. Anything else for your gaming week?
2062000	2068000	No, but now you all know the story of Anaheim and Animal Crossing of Teacup Park, which you're not allowed to visit.
2068000	2074000	Teacup Park, which you can look at, you can go in the park, you can sit on the things you can buy popcorn.
2074000	2078000	And because we couldn't get of course, there's not a churro machine and the teacups are all sealed off.
2078000	2083000	So no, no turning on teacups. It's just there. We even have like the little rope going across it. It looks really good.
2083000	2089000	It's pretty. I've been doing a similar ish thing. Like I have two gardens basically in my village right now.
2089000	2093000	I think I've changed. I remember the last time he came to smush land, but I've changed a little bit.
2093000	2099000	So like one like on one raised cliff, I didn't terraform a lot. I was more like I'm going to work with what I've got.
2099000	2107000	So on one raised cliff, I built like a Zen garden. So I have things like the stone archway, the Japanese headstone,
2107000	2111000	the fountains, the very beautiful like fountains, the deer scare, things like that.
2111000	2116000	And I have a lot of like my five by five, you know, the guides online that show you how to,
2116000	2120000	which I know isn't is apparently now not the best way to do the breeding of the flowers.
2120000	2129000	But I, you know, I've invested enough to find the rare flower island, getting other people to water your flowers.
2129000	2136000	Yes. Yes. That is a big one. And by the way, I did make my my whole bamboo forest Zen garden thing myself.
2136000	2144000	The only thing that ticks me off is that every time I go and I make sure I've watered every plant and I've like destroyed one or two watering cans doing it,
2144000	2151000	it inevitably rains an hour later. I always want to scream. Anyway, I did that in one area.
2151000	2157000	And then I have another area that's my more modern park that's a little more inspired by like a Central Park or something.
2157000	2162000	And that's where I put my teacups. And I have like the jungle gym thing is there.
2162000	2167000	And I put the big monster Godzilla there because it looks and I put like the metro clock.
2167000	2171000	So it looks a little more like a modern ish kind of theme park in that area.
2171000	2177000	So I have like my my relaxing park and my loud park. That makes sense.
2177000	2182000	It does. Yeah. So that's kind of that's what I've been doing with Smoosh Smoosh Land anyway.
2182000	2186000	I'm just trying to lure Wisp into my cemetery so I can get a screenshot with him there.
2186000	2190000	Oh, look at you, goth. All right. Anyway.
2190000	2195000	Loki, before I before I go on an Animal Crossing tangent, Loki, how was your gaming week?
2195000	2201000	My week was all right. I played mostly in let's see, Earth Defense Force Iron Rain.
2201000	2208000	So I'm like up through Mission 36 on that, I think. And that's been pretty fun.
2208000	2214000	It's a very pretty game, except the A.I. for the your teammates is absolutely garbage.
2214000	2225000	Like it's I don't know how it's possible that it's actually worse than any other game that I've seen in in that series or ever.
2225000	2233000	Or even like if I were to make up A.I. for like something like having never built A.I. whatsoever,
2233000	2241000	I still think it would have been better than that because they literally they'll be these giant bugs coming in instead of shooting them.
2241000	2246000	They are literally turned around 180 degrees shooting the ground or like that.
2246000	2249000	You keep hearing them. There's these towers in the game that you're not supposed to attack.
2249000	2254000	If you attack them, then they send out a burst of energy that attacks things around it and they keep saying,
2254000	2262000	well, stop shooting the tower. And meanwhile, they're just shooting the tower, just constantly shooting the tower.
2262000	2265000	It's funny just because how how useless they are.
2266000	2273000	But like to the point where it's just like you release this game, you thought this was OK, because it's not.
2273000	2277000	Thankfully, though, the excuse in the game is that you're like the super soldier.
2277000	2282000	And so you're like a one man army anyways. And so, I mean, they're just there to be decorations.
2282000	2286000	Basically, you do all the work. So, yeah. So I've been enjoying that a lot.
2286000	2292000	But it is just really weird, though. Otherwise, the game is pretty awesome and looks great.
2292000	2297000	And then, of course, I've been playing Orna. They just put out a really big patch on that.
2297000	2302000	So it looks quite a bit different now. I got a new ornate drop.
2302000	2306000	So I have a really high quality weapon now that I'm leveling up.
2306000	2312000	That's going to do 200 or has 200 points of attack more than my current weapon once I level out of the way up.
2312000	2319000	And yeah, I've just been mainly playing those two games, a little bit of set mania as well.
2319000	2322000	So I'm playing that and that's about it.
2322000	2326000	Yeah, I was kind of taken by surprise what a big update Orna got this week.
2326000	2331000	Like it's now that map, you can turn the map any which way, which is kind of cool.
2331000	2335000	Yeah, you used to be able to do that if you opted in for the beta features.
2335000	2337000	So they've had that for a while now.
2337000	2342000	I didn't like the beta map because I couldn't see as much. I didn't learn about the rotating thing till later.
2342000	2345000	So whatever. It's cool now. Yeah.
2345000	2350000	Yeah. So but I just the capturing a region interface I don't like.
2350000	2356000	I think they tried to make it more complicated so that people couldn't do the drive by captures as easy, which I understand.
2356000	2363000	You don't want people to play when they're driving. But I've I've definitely I've definitely played when Alan is driving.
2363000	2367000	And so I'm a little sad that that isn't as easy. Yeah, it was kind of fun.
2367000	2370000	Yeah, we'll do that. But whatever.
2370000	2378000	All right. Jamie, do you still have Orna installed? You should fire it up sometime because your player is still showing on my house.
2378000	2383000	I I do. Hold on. I'll just open it right now. I haven't looked at it in an age.
2383000	2386000	You probably you'll probably gain like 100 levels from all the XP we've been giving you.
2386000	2391000	Thank you guys for doing all the work for me. Yeah. Yeah. Right. All right. Anyway, so let's see.
2391000	2396000	My gaming week then. What else have I been playing? I've been playing a bit of Animal Crossing as well.
2396000	2400000	You know, trying to play the turnip market and all that and doing some of the things on my island that I talked about already.
2400000	2405000	I won't repeat that too much. I also played and beat.
2405000	2411000	Thank you very much. The Final Fantasy 7 remake. So it's not often that I play a game start to finish.
2411000	2415000	So I think this is a notable occasion that I actually finished the Final Fantasy 7 remake.
2415000	2420000	There is so, so much I want to talk about, but I'm not going to be the one that spoils it.
2420000	2423000	Don't worry. So I'm not going to get into that here.
2423000	2430000	I'm I like want to do a spoiler cast with some other friends who have beaten the game or already know the ending or what have you.
2430000	2438000	So that we can talk about it because it's it's something that's I can't I can't say that's that's what it is.
2438000	2441000	But I want to play. That's the game I do need to go and play.
2441000	2445000	Like I've been seeing like video clips online of like some of the mini games and stuff.
2445000	2450000	And I really do need to finish that. Yeah. They have a cool darts mini game pretty early on.
2450000	2456000	They have the squats and the pull ups like, you know, a lot of things that are kind of inspired by the original, of course, Final Fantasy 7.
2456000	2462000	Of course it is. So again, my thoughts and things on the game haven't changed a lot since last week.
2462000	2469000	So I'm not going to go off for an hour about Final Fantasy 7 again. I'm just going to say I'm satisfied completely with the remake.
2469000	2476000	I believe that I understand the ending. I believe I completely see what they're trying to do with it.
2476000	2484000	And I am such a fan. Like I it was one of those like, what? What?
2484000	2490000	So that anyway. Yeah. That's why I was. Yeah. I'm so, so happy with what they did with it.
2490000	2494000	I don't think everybody's going to be. But I was just like, it's incredible.
2494000	2501000	So, yeah, looking forward to seeing what comes next. So we'll see if they announce something at E3.
2501000	2504000	I'm using my Cody fingers or what they're going to do if we're gonna have to wait another year.
2504000	2512000	I don't know what happens now, but I enjoyed my 32 hours with the game that it took me from start to finish doing pretty much all the side quests that I could access,
2512000	2518000	because you intentionally can't access every single side quest until you go back through the game later on.
2518000	2525000	There's a particular chapter where you end up going this way or that way and you can go the other way when you go back through later on.
2525000	2531000	So that's all I'm going to say on the Final Fantasy 7 remake or else I'll spoil it.
2531000	2539000	So other things I want to talk about. I've been playing, of course, continuing on Final Fantasy 14 because I always play that game.
2539000	2543000	Trying to do more of the crafting and gathering. That's a section of the game I've been ignoring for a little while.
2543000	2551000	But thanks to, I was reminded that Diadem was redone for gathering in this latest patch, so I was checking that out.
2551000	2558000	Gathering is a nice little relaxing thing to do. I can do that on one monitor and watch somebody on Twitch on the other monitor, so that's cool.
2558000	2564000	And then I've been playing a lot of random stuff on Xbox, thanks to Xbox Game Pass.
2564000	2569000	A couple games I've played before, actually, that I just wanted to re-experience on Xbox.
2569000	2578000	Like Dead Cells, I'd played that a little bit on Switch, and so I ended up playing it on Game Pass on Xbox a little bit, because it's on Game Pass.
2578000	2586000	Wizard of Lore, shoot, I forget the name of the game, but I'd also played that on Switch a little bit.
2586000	2592000	And it's a roguelike, I guess, slash Diablo type of game.
2592000	2596000	Wizard of Legend, that's the name, I didn't even have to look it up. Wizard of Legend, I just took a minute for the name to come to me.
2597000	2601000	I was playing a little bit of that as well, so I've just been enjoying, yeah, those games.
2601000	2604000	So I'm hoping they're going to add even more to Game Pass in the coming weeks.
2604000	2610000	I need to go back and finish Nier, that's on my list of things to do, because that totally got derailed by my Final Fantasy VII play.
2610000	2615000	But now I'm also in the mindset where I'm like, I really want to play XII again, I want to play XIII again,
2615000	2621000	because we had that talk last week about how Final Fantasy VII Remake has a lot in common with Final Fantasy XIII.
2621000	2625000	I kind of want to go back and experience that again, but yeah, we'll see, whenever they get all that on Game Pass.
2625000	2628000	But otherwise, that is about it for my gaming week.
2628000	2633000	I also play a little bit of the game we're going to talk about here at the top of the show in the next news article,
2633000	2635000	so I'll save my thoughts until we get to that.
2635000	2640000	Otherwise, I guess we should get into some news. I don't have a lot of housekeeping right now.
2640000	2644000	We're still going to continue to do this show distance-wise.
2644000	2651000	How long? I don't know. I realize some states are starting to reopen a little bit,
2651000	2658000	but California is not one of them, and I'm pretty sure I can speak safely for everyone when I say,
2658000	2662000	we're going to listen to our governor, because our governor is listening to science,
2662000	2666000	and so when he says it's okay, I'll trust that.
2666000	2672000	Other ones, I'm not so sure I trust as much, but you do what works best for y'all.
2672000	2678000	But as far as OLR being in the same room, we'll do it when our science listening to governor says it's okay.
2679000	2682000	I don't think they're doing what's best for them at all anyway.
2682000	2685000	What do you mean? Here in this state or other places?
2685000	2688000	Not here in California, but just having talked to my mother.
2688000	2689000	Oh, for sure.
2689000	2691000	I'm not doing what's best for them.
2694000	2700000	Anyhow, let's move on and talk about some gaming news. Let's get into our first story tonight. Loki.
2701000	2704000	So this was a big update this week.
2704000	2710000	So Super Mario Maker 2 was given its last update called World Maker,
2710000	2713000	and World Maker added a bunch of things to the game,
2713000	2718000	but namely the biggest being the ability to create your own Super Mario worlds.
2718000	2723000	So you actually get to create the overworld, much like you would see in Super Mario World.
2723000	2730000	You could add up to, I believe, eight levels and a total of 40 stages in there,
2730000	2737000	and all sorts of fun stuff, even like the toad houses, pipes, you name it.
2737000	2743000	Aside from that, though, they did add a few more things, including, I believe, the rest of the Koopa Kids.
2743000	2752000	They added a Super Mario Brothers 2 mushroom in there, different head blocks, and a bunch of other stuff.
2752000	2758000	I think the Mecha Koopas, I don't remember what they're called, but yeah, lots of stuff.
2758000	2763000	So definitely worth checking out. It's a free update. It looks pretty cool.
2763000	2765000	I'm really curious to see what people are going to make with this.
2765000	2769000	So I actually jumped in there and played a little bit of Mario Maker 2.
2769000	2771000	That was the game I was referencing earlier.
2771000	2776000	I played a little bit of it because I heard about this update, and I ended up playing some Rando's World.
2776000	2779000	So you can go into the course bot or whatever it's called,
2779000	2783000	and there's a section where you can just kind of explore different worlds.
2783000	2785000	You just go in and it shows you random people's worlds.
2785000	2790000	And I just picked some person at random, and you have a little world map,
2790000	2795000	and it's basically like they've strung their courses together to make a map and a full game, if you will.
2795000	2799000	So I think that's pretty rad. I think it's a nice little bookend on things.
2799000	2802000	Yeah, I think it's pretty cool.
2802000	2807000	I have not yet played a level that had the Mario 2 stuff.
2807000	2810000	I thought that was a pretty bold thing for them to put in as well.
2810000	2814000	Which is not a full Mario 2 Maker. I don't want people to get the wrong idea.
2814000	2820000	But there's the whole mushroom that lets Mario pick up monsters like he was Mario 2 Mario.
2820000	2824000	I'm curious because you know how you can play four player multiplayer in that,
2824000	2827000	and each person's Toad or Luigi and stuff like that.
2827000	2831000	I wonder if they have the physics of those characters with that mushroom.
2831000	2834000	I would doubt it because it would break the balance of those levels,
2834000	2838000	but I don't know. I haven't tested it myself, but I'm assuming no.
2838000	2842000	But yeah, I want to get in there and play with some of the Mario 2 mechanics.
2842000	2846000	I like it every time that Mario Maker adds a new mechanic,
2846000	2851000	because people think of ways to use that mechanic in all these different ways.
2851000	2856000	Like the key and door thing. They do all these weird things with that, you know?
2856000	2860000	Oh yeah, that's right. They also have that whole thing with the key and the...
2860000	2866000	I forget what it was from Mario 2. The master attacks you when you take the key.
2866000	2867000	Oh, the phantos. Yeah.
2867000	2869000	Yeah, phantos. So that's pretty cool.
2869000	2873000	I am a little disappointed with all the cool stuff that they've added to it,
2873000	2875000	and I understand that they can't support the game forever.
2875000	2879000	That this is the last update, because it's like, oh man, look at all this cool stuff.
2879000	2884000	I was hoping it would be more like Mario 2 stuff,
2884000	2889000	or even it would be cool if you could get Samus' powers and stuff.
2889000	2894000	You know, do some cool things with that, like link.
2894000	2899000	Well, you can't say they haven't provided a lot of content beyond the original game.
2899000	2901000	They've done a lot, but it makes me want more, that's all.
2901000	2905000	Of course. The gamer is never satisfied, we want more.
2905000	2908000	But maybe they'll plan on doing a Mario Maker 3?
2908000	2912000	Or maybe they'll expand the Mario Maker concept into one of their other franchises?
2912000	2916000	I mean, after all, Link's Awakening kind of had that dungeon build.
2917000	2922000	Yes, it was a dungeon builder, but it was a thought.
2922000	2928000	It was a thought, but it wasn't fully realized in Mario Maker 2 that it was in that game.
2928000	2929000	For sure.
2929000	2933000	Dark Tetsuya says, yes, or NES Remix 3.
2933000	2938000	Orange Right says, it was the last free update, but then says, nah, that was probably it.
2938000	2940000	But that is true, they said the last free update.
2940000	2945000	Bobby Black Wolf says, Super Mario crossover, come on Nintendo, do it.
2945000	2952000	Yeah, that would be awesome. And I would all be about an NES Remix 3 or some type of user remix.
2952000	2953000	You remix.
2953000	2958000	Oh my god, can you imagine, as a fanboy for a second, can you imagine NES Remix?
2958000	2961000	NES Remix was the new Mario Maker game?
2961000	2964000	Oh, I would, oh, oh.
2966000	2968000	It's so good, yeah, I would love that, I would love that.
2968000	2974000	That's a franchise I just want to see come back as NES Remix, or Super Nintendo Remix, or whatever they want to do.
2974000	2979000	I would love that, but we'll see, we're kind of at Nintendo's mercy, I suppose, in that department.
2979000	2983000	Alright, well, moving on to another game that got a big update this week.
2983000	2989000	It's one we've already talked about earlier in the show, but Animal Crossing, we didn't really talk about the update, we didn't really focus on that.
2989000	2992000	Animal Crossing got a pretty big update this week, right?
2992000	3000000	We saw that there was a museum upgrade that happened, that Red came in, and now I've already bought one piece of fake artwork from him, that little bastard.
3000000	3002000	And nerfing.
3002000	3009000	Yeah, there was a lot of nerfing, the bugs got nerfed, the spawn of tarantulas and stuff got nerfed, right?
3009000	3015000	The bank interest took a nerf, but here, have a free mat to make up for it.
3015000	3019000	So a leaf showed up, which is cool, because they added the bushes, right?
3019000	3025000	So that's like a totally new thing for, at least New Horizons, to have the bushes in there.
3025000	3026000	And there's different types.
3026000	3027000	It was a new leaf.
3027000	3031000	Yeah, it wasn't the last game, but it wasn't in New Horizons yet, but now it is.
3031000	3040000	And everybody had the azalea bushes, but then the second bush was kind of, like, I had tea olive ones.
3040000	3045000	And then, like, I know my friend had holly bushes, and so there's different bushes.
3045000	3047000	I'm missing the holly.
3047000	3048000	Oh.
3048000	3050000	So I need holly if anyone has any.
3050000	3054000	They're gone? How do you, the bushes don't reproduce?
3054000	3055000	You buy them up.
3055000	3056000	Yeah.
3056000	3058000	Like, bulk of everywhere that I was.
3058000	3065000	See, you can come dig up a holly bush, but I want to keep my others that I have.
3065000	3068000	So hopefully, leaf comes back.
3068000	3069000	He should, though.
3069000	3071000	He shows up several times, right?
3071000	3074000	But he's just not there every day, right?
3074000	3075000	All right, anyway.
3075000	3077000	Yeah, he comes at random.
3077000	3089000	What is notable about this update is that an earlier data mining that happened a couple days before actually spoiled, shall we say, some of what happened in this update.
3089000	3098000	And the interesting thing is there were things in this data mine that wasn't in the update that could indicate that there are other updates coming.
3098000	3105000	One of them would include a museum café that could somehow incorporate the gyroids, because that isn't really in the game.
3105000	3110000	The only time you ever see a gyroid is when you're building a bridge or a ramp or something.
3110000	3112000	Yeah, I was going to ask if those are back in the game.
3112000	3119000	Not yet, but now we've seen Nintendo fully plans to patch this game, too, to add new stuff.
3119000	3129000	So it'll be, and that's kind of interesting, too, because, you know, I think we're getting right around the time where a lot of people, especially if you're playing the stock market, are paying off their loans.
3129000	3132000	So there might be less and less incentive for people to check in the game.
3132000	3144000	But if they kind of drip feed some of this extra stuff, like the art wing and the bushes and maybe the café and the gyroids in the future, it's going to give people a reason to keep going and keep checking in on the game, which I think is very interesting.
3144000	3155000	Let's see. There's going to be vegetables, apparently, in a later update. They're saying tomato, wheat, sugar cane, potato, carrot, and pumpkin.
3155000	3165000	Apparently something with a seafood critterpedia page that indicates that at some point you may be able to actually sea dive, which I think that would be brand new for Animal Crossing, right?
3165000	3169000	I don't think we've ever had that in an Animal Crossing game where you'd actually sea dive.
3169000	3170000	We have.
3170000	3171000	Oh, have we?
3171000	3172000	Yes, we have.
3172000	3173000	What was it?
3173000	3174000	It was a new leaf.
3174000	3175000	Oh, what did you do? I don't remember it at all. Was it just...
3176000	3186000	Yeah, you would see a little dark shadow or something and you would be able to dive for it to get certain clams and things. It's been a while since I've played new leaf.
3186000	3187000	Yeah.
3187000	3191000	But I mean, yeah, it was in there as of the last game.
3192000	3199000	So that's some interesting things to look forward to for sure. I think that's especially the vegetable stuff because I know some people have been missing some of the other.
3199000	3210000	I'm not seeing in the data mine or whatever, I'm not seeing anything about bananas or some of the islands, the durians and some of the fruit that was more native to islands.
3210000	3215000	I'm not seeing that that is coming over yet, but maybe that'll come much later. Who knows?
3215000	3219000	There's still plenty of months that they're probably going to continue to support this.
3219000	3223000	I mean, heck, how long ago was Mario Maker 2 released? That's about a year old at this point, right?
3223000	3228000	So I think we can fully expect that Animal Crossing will probably get regular updates for about a year.
3228000	3229000	Yeah, it was like last June.
3229000	3233000	Yeah, last June. It was right before last E3, I think, when they released that.
3233000	3238000	And then I think Splatoon 2 is very similar where they got regular updates for about a year.
3238000	3242000	So hopefully we'll be seeing that sort of thing in Animal Crossing for quite some time.
3243000	3249000	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, yeah, Leaf needs to come back so I can sell off my weeds.
3249000	3254000	Dark Tetsuya says, Rob, the trick is to look up the piece you're buying online to make sure it's the real deal.
3254000	3260000	I do know that, but I don't always know the name of the painting. I'm not an art history student.
3260000	3265000	I guess I could Google image search or something, but I kind of just have to go, does this look right?
3265000	3267000	I've heard some of them are very obvious.
3267000	3274000	My friend got a David statue in his town that was very fake because what David was holding was something completely different.
3274000	3281000	But I think some of them are harder to spot than others if you don't have a rich knowledge of art, which I'm going to fully admit I don't.
3281000	3287000	So I know a lot of useless pop culture shit, but I don't necessarily know my art history.
3287000	3291000	If there was a way I could know the names of the paintings and Google them.
3291000	3295000	I'm sure there's probably an online reference somewhere. That's just why I need to look up.
3295000	3300000	There's probably just a website out there that's like, here are all the Animal Crossing paintings and how to spot if it's a fake.
3300000	3305000	And that's probably just what I need to use, I suppose. Cheat. That's what I need to do.
3305000	3309000	I need to cheat. Use my references.
3309000	3317000	Well, no, in that case, something like that isn't cheating. I mean, for me, I took how much art history and I even still need to look a few of them up.
3317000	3324000	I go, bitch, that's wrong. And others are like, is that did he wear a hat?
3324000	3331000	Yeah, exactly. I need to teach Siri to understand whether or not those name paintings are fake or not.
3331000	3334000	Hey, Siri, is this a fake painting or not?
3334000	3341000	Amo three eighty seven in our chat says there are a couple where literally a hand is in a slightly different position and stuff.
3341000	3346000	Yeah, that's the stuff. That's what worries me is that some of them are going to be like really like slightly different.
3346000	3351000	And that's the stuff I'm definitely not going to be able to spot, like David holding something completely different in his hand.
3351000	3356000	I might be able to recognize that, but like some of these other paintings, I don't know so much about that.
3356000	3361000	And then Bobby Blackwell says it's an open book test. I like that. Yes, it is an open book test.
3361000	3366000	And Amo three eighty seven says there is a list. I shared it in different Facebook groups and discords.
3366000	3373000	I'm in LOL. I'm sure I'm sure just like that, a flower crossbreeding guide, it's spreading like wildfire.
3373000	3378000	Well, and don't forget, some of us have the guide on order. Dan got it for me for my birthday.
3378000	3383000	Oh, yeah, the official guide, right? Yeah, it should be. It ships, I think, on the 30th.
3383000	3389000	But would the official guide cover this because it's in a patch? It might not cover the painting.
3389000	3395000	Why not? Because since it's a sponsored strategy guide, I would think they'd have all that stuff ready to go for print.
3395000	3400000	I wonder if the strategy guide might give away some other stuff coming in the future then. Who knows?
3400000	3404000	All right. Well, there you go. There's there's your other Animal Crossing update for this episode.
3404000	3408000	But I know tons and tons of people are living their lives in Animal Crossing right now.
3408000	3413000	And I can't say I blame you. All right. Moving on. Dark Sakura.
3413000	3423000	Well, we had brought up earlier about just how video games were starting to go more digital, have more events.
3423000	3426000	We had that concert. We had other things going on.
3426000	3435000	But digital video games hit a record by 10 billion sales in March,
3435000	3441000	which I'm pretty sure some of those Animal Crossing people were involved in that and the Doom peoples.
3441000	3455000	So basically, it went from 883 million in February to 1.5 billion in March.
3455000	3463000	So basically, PC games actually climbed 56% in sales.
3463000	3469000	So it was, of course, widespread over Europe and North America for the most part.
3469000	3475000	They're looking really for reliable ways of getting the games or they don't have to leave the house.
3475000	3481000	Nintendo sold five million copies of Animal Crossing New Horizons in March.
3481000	3488000	And it set a sales record for the most units of a digital console game sold in a single month.
3488000	3491000	That's pretty impressive.
3491000	3496000	Mobile games rose 15%.
3496000	3503000	So most mobile games for the month of March was $5.7 billion.
3503000	3514000	Pokemon Go saw its revenue jump 18% in March after Niantic changed the leveling rules so you don't have to be out of the house.
3514000	3516000	I'm actually kind of surprised by that.
3516000	3523000	I would have thought Niantic was doing that to kind of keep that game hanging on and yet it's actually having the effect where more people...
3523000	3525000	That's fascinating to me, actually.
3525000	3528000	I'm kind of with Jason in the intro to tonight's show.
3528000	3532000	A lot of this news isn't necessarily surprising because, of course, we're all stuck at home.
3532000	3534000	Of course, we're buying more games digitally.
3534000	3538000	But when you hear things like that, that is surprising to me.
3538000	3544000	I don't really know. I really wasn't super surprised by it. I really was not.
3544000	3547000	Well, the Pokemon Go one. Wow, yeah.
3547000	3549000	No, I'm really not surprised by that either.
3549000	3558000	And this is me incorporating the people who are...
3558000	3560000	I don't want to say lazy, but people who are lazy.
3560000	3566000	Who don't go walking around, who don't think about the game because they're not leaving the house.
3566000	3574000	Or even that, for people who just might have been too busy in everyday life to remember to open up the app.
3574000	3576000	Now they have time to do this.
3576000	3581000	And of course, if you're right next to your Pokestop, then yeah, I'll buy some coins.
3581000	3588000	Get some more of this package stuff here and get some more eggs because I get that free walking stuff every day.
3588000	3590000	I'm not super surprised by it at all.
3591000	3595000	And let's also throw in that we've got some of the freebie services going on right now.
3595000	3601000	Stadia is free for two or three months? Two months.
3601000	3604000	So free access to Stadia for two months right now.
3604000	3609000	You've got all the freebies offered up on PlayStation Network.
3609000	3613000	I grabbed Pac-Man myself. A few other things.
3613000	3618000	They have actually a pretty decent list of just freebie games that look really fun.
3618000	3621000	Uncharted and Journey were the other two big ones, yeah.
3621000	3626000	Uncharted is only for PlayStation Plus, I think.
3626000	3629000	No, it was at one point.
3629000	3631000	Because when I looked, it said...
3631000	3636000	It was at one point PlayStation Plus only, but Uncharted and Journey were free for everybody.
3638000	3642000	I don't know how long. It may be over. I don't know how long.
3642000	3644000	I think it said through May 4th.
3645000	3647000	Yeah, chat is confirming. Bob Coffey says,
3647000	3650000	Uncharted 1 through 3 collection free for everyone.
3650000	3654000	Uncharted 4 is PSN Plus. There it is. That's the confusion.
3654000	3658000	The newest Uncharted is PSN Plus, but you can get the old collection for free.
3658000	3660000	Gotcha, gotcha.
3660000	3666000	But yeah. So anyway, I think my bit of news was a big duh.
3666000	3670000	But at any rate, there you go.
3670000	3676000	We're seeing it actually now as the viable money maker that they thought it was going to be a few years ago.
3676000	3679000	Even though, yes, I think we're all agreeing.
3679000	3683000	Jason said in the intro and I said, and you're saying that it is kind of a duh.
3683000	3690000	I think at the same time, how much of an increase is partially surprising.
3690000	3696000	The types of things like, again, Pokemon Go or just how much Animal Crossing.
3696000	3699000	I think we all expected the digital games were going to take off in this situation.
3699000	3704000	But could anyone have predicted that Animal Crossing would sell that much?
3704000	3707000	That is huge. Well, you're biased.
3707000	3713000	No, seriously though, I'm paying attention to all of the hype that we saw online.
3713000	3718000	I mean, and I keep in mind, I am in a few other groups, right?
3718000	3721000	But I was seeing just a lot of people who were like,
3721000	3725000	Hey, I'm really looking forward to Animal Crossing or, you know,
3725000	3729000	people who I never thought would be Animal Crossing fans.
3729000	3731000	Like, yeah, I can't wait to come out.
3731000	3736000	So I guess I wasn't surprised because I had seen so many people talking about it.
3736000	3738000	It could just be in the circles that I'm in.
3738000	3743000	Maybe. And online hype doesn't always translate into dollars either.
3743000	3747000	Because sometimes, and it might be because the reviews come out before the game does
3747000	3749000	and it kind of derails a lot of that hype.
3749000	3751000	You know what I mean?
3751000	3754000	Like No Man's Sky maybe is kind of one that comes to mind.
3754000	3757000	Although, again, where that game is at now is completely different.
3757000	3761000	But anyway, we've talked about that a million times before.
3761000	3764000	I think also the other question I kind of want to bring up with this
3764000	3768000	and I think that this article that you've gone over raises this question is,
3768000	3773000	Is there a permanent change now that's going to come because of this?
3773000	3778000	You know, we've been watching this industry kind of slowly trend towards digital.
3778000	3780000	But there's been many of us that have been holding out on it.
3780000	3784000	And I don't think suddenly overnight everybody is going to let go.
3784000	3786000	And again, just like, and I've said this before on the show,
3786000	3791000	just like the music industry, just like Blu-rays, CDs, records,
3791000	3795000	there's always going to be collectors that want physical media.
3795000	3798000	That part will never go away.
3798000	3805000	But as far as our industry as a whole and where the masses, the common players
3805000	3809000	and the casuals are going, do we think that there is maybe permanent change?
3809000	3811000	That's going to happen because of this.
3811000	3813000	Because so many people went digital with Animal Crossing
3813000	3817000	and because so many people are going digital for the Final Fantasy 7 remake
3817000	3819000	and other things that are happening during this time,
3819000	3824000	is that going to have some type of permanent impact once this pandemic?
3824000	3829000	But I mean, once we come out of the other side of the pandemic, what do you think?
3829000	3832000	I think that there's no choice but to move with this.
3832000	3838000	I really think that there is zero choice but to embrace the new reality.
3838000	3840000	This is our reality now.
3840000	3843000	We have proven, you know, so many companies just in general,
3843000	3845000	and I'm thinking big scope, right?
3845000	3847000	Like, oh, we can't have our people work from home.
3847000	3850000	It's going to be too hard, too expensive, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3850000	3853000	And they're doing just fine.
3853000	3857000	You know, people are like, oh, I need my physical copy and all the blah, blah, blah.
3857000	3860000	They're doing just fine.
3860000	3863000	You know, it's viable.
3863000	3865000	People are enjoying it.
3865000	3868000	And, yeah, there's still people who want their physical copies,
3868000	3871000	who wait for it to ship and everything, and that's fine, too.
3871000	3876000	But I actually, you know, me, I'm the big packaging whore.
3876000	3878000	I love to see the packaging thing that comes in.
3878000	3881000	I like to see, you know, what designers can do.
3881000	3883000	That makes me happy.
3883000	3886000	But they're still designing the artwork on the digital copies, too.
3886000	3888000	You like your dishes?
3888000	3892000	You have your dish that came with that one Dreamcast game that you have?
3892000	3894000	Yes.
3894000	3898000	But I'm more talking about, like, artwork and design elements and all of these things.
3898000	3900000	Sure.
3900000	3906000	And it's just like, and, you know, for me, who had a focus on print media when I was in college,
3906000	3909000	I've gone digital with my work.
3909000	3913000	And I work just as hard as I would have worked doing something for print.
3913000	3916000	Now I don't have to nail ink fumes.
3916000	3920000	A very good point from Bobby in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network,
3920000	3926000	who says, I will continue to buy physical as long as possible because my data cap will return once this is all over.
3926000	3933000	I can't afford the additional bandwidth hit downloading an 85 gig game like Final Fantasy 7 Remake after buying the game.
3933000	3935000	Right now, I have no data cap.
3935000	3938000	That data cap is returning in a few months.
3938000	3940000	And you do raise a good point.
3940000	3944000	And, you know, I think that's another reason why more people are willing to go digital right now
3944000	3946000	because there's that kind of digital free for all.
3946000	3948000	But let me ask this question, too.
3948000	3951000	We're all assuming the data cap is coming back.
3951000	3953000	Will it?
3953000	3959000	That leads it back to the other point about companies saying, oh, it was too expensive to let people do this or this way.
3959000	3965000	We'll lose money if we, you know, drop the data cap.
3965000	3968000	Yet they're still making their money.
3968000	3969000	Uh-huh.
3969000	3973000	And I think it's easy to have the knee-jerk reaction of, yes, the data caps will come back.
3973000	3976000	And, you know, I tend to agree, yes, the data caps will come back.
3976000	3984000	But now, like, you know, piggybacking on what Jamie's saying, they're going to have a lot harder time holding on to the argument on why the data caps exist in the first place.
3984000	3990000	And you have to look at where are some of the permanent changes to society happening.
3990000	3993000	We also have to consider where people live, too.
3993000	3995000	That is, yeah, of course, of course.
3995000	3998000	You know, for them having a physical, going back to the physical copy thing, that's going to make more sense for them.
3998000	4000000	They should have limited prints of it.
4000000	4001000	But, I mean.
4001000	4003000	Nobody's talking about physical going away.
4003000	4010000	But I'm talking about, you know, is digital going to really start to take over the way that the industry has kind of thought it would several years ago.
4010000	4020000	And even so, as we're also looking into people doing a bit more minimalist living and focusing a bit more on actually what they need to have.
4020000	4027000	And I've seen more people, I have personally talked to people who are like, you know what, I have all of this excess in my house.
4027000	4032000	And now that I'm here 24-7, I didn't realize just how clogged up my home is.
4032000	4036000	And donating things and getting rid of things and downsizing.
4036000	4040000	And I think we're going to see that continue to trend as well.
4040000	4044000	And that's going to go right into all these physical copies of games where people can afford to do that.
4044000	4051000	I just think, you know, there may be some type of societal changes that happen when it comes to these data caps in the first place.
4051000	4058000	What I mean by that, let me explain myself, is that like, and I don't like to talk too much about my day job because I like to separate my day life and my night life.
4058000	4065000	But my day job has said that there will probably, like we haven't really done this working at home thing before.
4065000	4067000	We obviously kind of had no choice because of the situation.
4067000	4074000	And now they're saying, you know, this will probably be a part of our culture in some shape or form for the foreseeable future.
4074000	4080000	So meaning that because this whole thing happened, it kind of showed that work at home was possible and everybody's able to kind of succeed in it.
4080000	4083000	And so it's something they're thinking about working into the culture in the future.
4083000	4087000	And I'm sure this company I'm at is not the only one that's thinking about that, right?
4087000	4094000	There's probably lots of companies out there that are like, huh, you know, now that we've tried this work at home thing, we might kind of do this a little more in the future.
4094000	4103000	And so that starts this snowball of now there's going to be more demand for Internet and bandwidth and things like that.
4103000	4110000	So it's going to, I think, force some of these Internet companies to, you know, it's going to drive up demand for Internet companies.
4110000	4115000	And if Internet companies are not willing to get rid of the bandwidth on their own, there's going to be more competition that opens up,
4115000	4122000	especially as we start to move into 5G, which did not cause this whole situation, of course.
4122000	4127000	But I've heard that stuff, of course. But we know that that's the technology that things are going in.
4127000	4135000	But, you know, it is certainly a fair point to say, I live in a big city, so that type of stuff is still accessible for me.
4135000	4140000	There's still a lot of rural parts of the nation where the dialogue is going to be very different.
4141000	4150000	And so, sure, for that part, I kind of understand. But I just, I think it is a fair question to say, we're all assuming these data caps are coming back.
4150000	4154000	But are they going to come back, if they come back, is it going to be the same way we've always known it?
4154000	4160000	I think there's going to be a lot of pressure kind of pushed back on the companies to do it a little differently next time.
4160000	4162000	But we'll see. I mean, we'll see. Anything's possible, I suppose.
4162000	4167000	Again, I can't tell the future. If I could, I might have done a lot of things different in the early months of 2020.
4167000	4170000	I'll put it this way. I don't think we're going to go back to where we were.
4170000	4172000	I don't think so either.
4172000	4180000	I think that change, keeping a lot of the aspects of this, that we are, I think we're going to have to get used to it.
4180000	4189000	And not going more into history, but if you study any epidemiology, especially looking back to the 1918 influenza outbreak,
4190000	4193000	the second wave is always worse, and China's already seen it.
4193000	4198000	The quarantine, the shelter in place is not over.
4198000	4201000	And theirs went for, what, three years?
4201000	4208000	And we're looking at something that's probably killing more people in light of the medical advancements that we have.
4208000	4214000	So, I think we are looking at this being our new normal.
4215000	4219000	I think a lot can change in a few months.
4219000	4223000	And I think five months ago, we had no idea what any of this was.
4223000	4227000	And so I think it's very, very hard to say what's going to happen five months from now.
4227000	4230000	I think the answer is we don't know. Nobody knows.
4230000	4233000	I think, actually, history is a very good teacher.
4233000	4238000	And we are seeing it actively repeating itself right now.
4238000	4242000	It can be, but I also don't necessarily want to be doom and gloom about it all.
4242000	4245000	I'm not being doom and gloom. I'm being realistic.
4245000	4249000	The same thing happened, and it's happening again right now.
4249000	4252000	All right. I'm going to just move on to the next topic.
4252000	4255000	So let's move on to our next topic. Loki.
4255000	4260000	All right. I was just going to say, I've been hearing a lot of good things from this Umbrella Corp.
4260000	4264000	And I think they have the answer to solving this whole COVID-19 problem.
4264000	4269000	In the meantime, though, we should be concerned about our Nintendo accounts.
4269000	4275000	So if you have a my Nintendo account, you might want to go ahead and turn on that two-step verification,
4275000	4284000	because apparently there's been a breach and about 160,000 accounts have been breached by hackers as well.
4284000	4289000	Apparently earlier this month, while payment information was not accessed,
4289000	4297000	so they don't have the ability to see your payment, they can make unauthorized purchases with your account.
4297000	4306000	As I've seen some of the comments in there, but so apparently these network IDs were originally connected to the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS.
4306000	4319000	So it's a bit older. So basically, they have decided to disable the login function and reset the passwords of the affected accounts.
4319000	4322000	So if you haven't had that happen yet, good luck for you.
4322000	4326000	But still, good idea to put on that two-factor authentication wherever possible.
4326000	4332000	And that doesn't just necessarily go for your my Nintendo account, but anywhere you can get it.
4334000	4340000	You know, this whole news, like, well, I'm also kind of not surprised because, you know, these types of breaches are always going to happen.
4340000	4342000	But there were a couple of elements that surprised me about it.
4342000	4346000	Number one was that Nintendo has two-factor authentication in the first place.
4346000	4352000	I didn't even know that because, you know, we always kind of joke that Nintendo lags behind in some of the online stuff.
4352000	4355000	And I swear they haven't always had it. And I don't know when they rolled it out.
4355000	4362000	Yeah, I don't remember that either because usually we'd see some sort of story on, like, the blog sites or whatever saying, hey, yeah, they have it.
4362000	4367000	Because that's what it was with PlayStation Plus and or the PlayStation accounts.
4367000	4372000	And that's when I added it there. But yeah, I don't remember when they would have added this.
4373000	4378000	Yeah, but I'm glad to know it's there now because I absolutely went and enabled it.
4378000	4385000	Because it's funny because I was using Nintendo Network as my universal sign in because it was what we used on the Wii U.
4385000	4390000	And it just at the time, the Switch, I don't see anything wrong with it until this whole thing happened.
4390000	4396000	But luckily, so far, knock, knock, I wasn't reset. Like, Nintendo did not reset my account.
4396000	4402000	So I'm assuming I wasn't part of the breach. And I haven't had any problems.
4402000	4411000	Again, knock on wood. But I went and enabled two-factor authentication right away so that if something does happen, at least they'll have that hurdle to get over, which will be a pretty big one.
4411000	4414000	I was also surprised that they're using Google Authenticator.
4414000	4423000	I did not learn until I was listening to Bobby tonight that you could just load any Google Authenticator thing into Authy, which is the app I use for Discord and Twitch and all that other stuff.
4423000	4429000	So I didn't even know you could roll it all into one app. I thought you had to use Google Authenticator, so there's that.
4429000	4436000	But I thought it was interesting that Nintendo instead of like, because like Sony and Microsoft, they text message you numbers.
4436000	4445000	And I think Apple is very similar as well, where they pop up that number on my iPhone when I try to log into something online.
4445000	4450000	So it's interesting that Nintendo is kind of using a third-party authentication system rather than their own.
4450000	4460000	And I had it on my phone already, and I was like, well, why do I have this? And then I noticed that the account that's stored on there was for Rockstar Social Club.
4460000	4466000	So for Grand Theft Auto, which I haven't played in forever, is where that was.
4466000	4473000	But yeah, most of the other companies have kind of the whole thing where they'll text you a code to get in and that type of thing.
4473000	4478000	And then Steam has its own authenticator built into their app, so that helps too.
4478000	4485000	Tiger Claw on Chat says, friend codes are just about the most secure system they had. You didn't use friend codes to log in, though.
4485000	4493000	Friend code was what identified your Nintendo Wii, let's say, because you didn't really log into your Nintendo Wii, and a friend code would identify your Wii.
4493000	4504000	But nobody could use, because you didn't log into it, nobody could use your Wii to buy your information, unless they physically had your Nintendo Wii.
4504000	4511000	So friend codes were how you identified your Wii to someone else's Wii. It's so funny to say, but you know what I mean.
4511000	4518000	So you didn't really have a log in. Log ins didn't start until they had the Wii U.
4518000	4526000	And then that's when they used the Nintendo Network, and now they have just a unified Nintendo Online system, because they wanted to tie it all together with their mobile phones and all that.
4526000	4539000	If you look at some of the early, early stuff about Nintendo Switch, when they were actually calling it NX, you actually saw some of this Nintendo Online unified system between mobile and Wii U and NX,
4539000	4545000	as they were calling it at the time and so forth, because this was a big deal for Nintendo, was to bring that all together.
4545000	4553000	But anyway, AMO 387 in our chat says you can set up Microsoft with Google Authenticator 2. I didn't know that.
4553000	4562000	Okay, so I have something where they text message me, and I don't know if that's just through Google or what, but it doesn't use the actual third party authenticator.
4562000	4569000	I prefer that. I mean, I get it that someone could clone your phone or something like that, but I'm like, eh, really?
4570000	4577000	Yeah, I doubt that anyone would do that, but yeah, I kind of prefer that than having to open another app.
4577000	4583000	Because a lot of times where they're having me sign in because, oh, we don't recognize this computer, it's always my own computer.
4583000	4590000	Like, I've used this computer dozens of times to sign in. They're like, well, do you want us to remember this computer?
4590000	4595000	Yes, please stop asking me to sign into this computer, and then two days later, I don't know this computer.
4595000	4599000	It's like, Jesus Christ, you know, work.
4599000	4607000	All right. Well, anyway, I would strongly, strongly advise that you all enable your two factor authentication on Nintendo if you haven't already.
4607000	4613000	You know, especially if you have any type of credit card information saved on Nintendo, then you double want to do that.
4613000	4618000	If you are the type that uses point cards to do everything, then you kind of at least have that type of security.
4618000	4627000	But I don't know. I still wouldn't want people getting into my account, so I would highly recommend two factor authentication unless there is some legit reason why you can't do it.
4627000	4631000	Which I can't think of anything off the top of my head, but maybe you don't have a cell phone. I don't know.
4631000	4638000	So, yeah. Yeah, I agree with AMO 387 in chat. Always set up two factor authentication if it's offered. Absolutely.
4638000	4643000	I'm definitely, especially because I have had my crap hacked before, and it's stupid.
4643000	4650000	Like, Xbox 360 was the biggest example. Many years ago on this show, somebody logged into my account, spent like a hundred bucks on FIFA, and that ticked me off.
4650000	4658000	You know, two factor authentication wasn't really around as much then. But even more recently, I would say my Epic Game Store account was the one that also got hacked.
4658000	4665000	And luckily, I didn't have a credit card. I have not bought anything with a credit card on the Epic Store, and I won't now because it was hacked.
4665000	4674000	But I did find out they have two factor authentication as well, so maybe I feel a little bit safer, but I still think Epic Store should put out those point cards for sure.
4674000	4684000	All right. Anyway, let's move on and talk about kind of a follow-up to something we've been following for the past couple weeks, and it has to do with Nintendo Switch productions.
4684000	4689000	As you guys, of course, know, Nintendo Switches, they're a little hard to find right now.
4689000	4697000	And we've been talking in previous episodes about how some of the COVID issues in Japan were stopping some of the production from happening for a little bit.
4697000	4704000	Last week, we talked about that they're back on, but we still have like scalpers and robots that buy these things up just as soon as they're available.
4704000	4708000	So Nintendo is really trying to get that worked out.
4708000	4721000	Nikkei did an interview with Nintendo saying, we hope suppliers will be responsive to the production increase, but for procurement of some parts, the outlook remains uncertain, and we can't forecast exactly how many Switches can be supplied.
4721000	4735000	But their goal is 10%. According to Nintendo, the company hopes to produce about 10% more units of the Switch series in 2020, up from around 20 million last year.
4735000	4744000	And I did a little double-take when I heard Switch series, and I was like, oh yeah, the Switch Lite and the regular Switch would be a series, because I was like, ooh, are they giving away that there's another one?
4744000	4749000	There might be, but we don't know anything about that yet. So they're talking about the Switch and the Switch Lite.
4749000	4754000	Obviously, the supply chain is part of the problem here, which probably doesn't surprise people.
4754000	4761000	We know there's been issues with factories because in other countries, they're having to deal with these COVID issues as well and shutting down and so forth.
4761000	4767000	So a lot of that's just kind of snowballed into what's going on now with Nintendo Switch and why they're getting to be a little harder to find.
4767000	4777000	But Nintendo is committing to ramping up productions and has, I guess, signed the deals necessary to increase production. So we'll see.
4777000	4787000	Again, please don't buy from scalpers and third-party sellers. Unfortunately, I don't think the audience of this show would really do that type of stuff anyway.
4787000	4792000	I think, unfortunately, the reality is we could all form a pact that we're not going to do that sort of thing.
4792000	4803000	But there's going to be people that just don't know better, who have a lot of disposable money, who are willing to throw a lot of money at these things to make their kids happy.
4803000	4815000	So I don't know if we alone here at OLR can stop it. But urge your friends, urge people, please don't buy from these third-party sellers because it only creates problems for everybody.
4815000	4819000	But that's all we can really do. All right, moving on, Dark Sakura.
4819000	4825000	Sorry, I thought I hit my unmute button. I was going to say, but Rob, Karen needs one now. You don't understand.
4825000	4832000	I know. Well, it's not Karen that needs one. It's Karen Jr. that needs one. But anyway.
4832000	4841000	My little Carlisle needs one now. Where's your manager? No. Right? Anyway.
4842000	4850000	My Hannah spelled with a silent C and an extra H. My little Hannah needs a switch right now.
4850000	4852000	Rob, that's Hannah.
4852000	4853000	Hannah.
4853000	4864000	Hannah. Anyway. So going back to Nintendo systems, though, we have systems that are available to people in Japan.
4864000	4869000	So you know what it is? It's Super Famicom.
4869000	4883000	So there is a group called the Japan Retro Game Association who has a buttload of Super Famicom ready to hand out to families with children under 16 who can pay the shipping fees.
4883000	4888000	But basically, you know, those are the most eligible of them. So they have kind of a lottery system open up.
4888000	4899000	It's open until tomorrow in Japan, April 27th, where, you know, you are chosen, you just pay the shipping fees and you get yourself a Super Famicom.
4899000	4911000	It looks like they have 100 units. So I mean, they are some of them are pretty yellow in that classic, you know, Super Famicom, Super Nintendo style.
4911000	4922000	But, you know, it looks like some of the games that are in here, we have some Final Fantasy 3 and Final Fantasy 2 and some Donkey Kong Country.
4922000	4928000	I'm just trying to look at the picture and get a close up on it. So they're setting some good games with it. I mean, that's really awesome.
4928000	4937000	And of course, I've seen stuff that, you know, would pay, you know, out the nose for over here for classic games, you can get super cheap in Japan.
4937000	4949000	I'm not saying, you know, go run out to the store. But I mean, you got Yahoo! Auction, you have Yahoo! Japan, you've got all kinds of different, you know, ways of having classic games shipped to you.
4949000	4958000	So I think with such a massive log on there too, or shoot, people get an EverDrive for it. Not that I'm saying necessarily play the ROMs, but this is the time to do it.
4958000	4967000	You know, you'd be amazed at everything that you'd have access for and you discovery that kids are going to be able to make for their games.
4967000	4977000	Well, this is a nice little thing for Karen to get little Skylar and that's spelled S-K-Y-L-A-H-R out of her hair for a little bit.
4977000	4979000	She doesn't need to buy the Switch from a third party seller.
4979000	4981000	Don't forget, Mackenzie wants to play too.
4981000	4991000	I know. And she can get, for her twins, she can get a Super Famicom because, you know what, kids need to grow up on the classics, right?
4991000	5002000	This is in Japan, so it'd be someone with like one of those kid-a-kid-a names that are like the equivalent of our, kid-a-kid-a means sparkle. It's, you know, one of those.
5002000	5008000	So they call them sparkly names where they don't actually are like a real name. They're just more like something that sounded pretty.
5008000	5015000	So I really am trying to think of what a good millennial Japanese housewife name is.
5015000	5017000	It's all good. It's all good.
5017000	5030000	Yeah. But at any rate, this would be in Japan. So not a bad thing, you know, and quite likely I think it would take better care of the systems and folks over here might so in general.
5030000	5040000	Yeah. And also to be clear, this is not the Super Famicom mini. This is a legit Super Famicom and, you know, that still plays.
5040000	5046000	You know, we were joking earlier in the show about, you know, consoles that are built like a brick and still run solid.
5046000	5055000	Super Nintendo is another very good example. And Super Famicom, of course, is another very good example of like, do you know anyone with a broken Super Nintendo?
5055000	5057000	I mean, they might look gross as hell.
5057000	5058000	It has to be physically broken.
5058000	5064000	Yeah. You you cannot break those things unless you want to. I mean, like, you know, if I challenged you to break one, you probably could.
5064000	5069000	But I'm saying like those things do not die unless you killed it.
5069000	5076000	They might look ugly because they brown that with that oxygen thing or whatever. But yeah, you are smokers.
5076000	5085000	Yeah, that too. But yeah, those those things are hard to break. So it's not surprising that there's 100 working Super Famicom. Somebody has a warehouse somewhere.
5085000	5089000	So, wow. You want to know what the number one kirakira name is in Japan?
5089000	5090000	What is that?
5090000	5092000	Caesar. Sisa.
5092000	5095000	OK. I didn't. You learn something new.
5095000	5099000	Number three. Number three is Luvha.
5099000	5104000	AMO 387 talking about the GameCube. The GameCube was great. Someone could break into your house.
5104000	5109000	You can knock them out with your GameCube, call the police and go back to playing Metroid Prime just fine.
5109000	5111000	Well, it has a handle on it. That's perfect.
5111000	5116000	The GameCube had that convenient little carrying handle so you could just pick it up and flack somebody with it.
5116000	5119000	I mean, have you ever dropped a GameCube cube on your foot on the corner?
5119000	5123000	No, I did. No. Well, it was running a game and we're still playing still caliber.
5123000	5128000	The GameCube was such a badass little system. It really did not get enough credit.
5128000	5133000	If you didn't mod it, you could just get one of the disk loaders and play all your imports, because I mean, I was playing.
5134000	5140000	Remember when I decided that I was going to play Dōbutsu no Mori i Plus to try to get better at reading Japanese?
5142000	5151000	I learned very quickly that getting better at reading it and actually understanding all but, you know, I was maybe getting through 75% of the game OK.
5151000	5154000	But I was like, is this someone's name?
5154000	5156000	You know what else I...
5156000	5157000	What is...
5157000	5158000	Go ahead.
5158000	5162000	Oh, I was just like, and that's how I learned like half of the Japanese names playing that.
5162000	5170000	You know, you know what I miss about classic consoles are the splash screens when you first boot up the console.
5170000	5172000	And the GameCube had a badass one, that little...
5174000	5180000	And like people made the most hilarious fucking vines out of that GameCube loading screen.
5180000	5185000	I'm sure you guys have seen your short, short little parody GameCube loading screens.
5185000	5190000	And then, of course, the Dreamcast or the original PlayStation. I kind of miss that.
5190000	5192000	Consoles don't really have that so much anymore.
5192000	5193000	Like, I guess...
5193000	5196000	I guess like the Xbox 360 had that little...
5197000	5198000	But it's not as exciting.
5198000	5200000	Nothing is going to beat the OG PlayStation one.
5202000	5205000	It's one of my ringtones on my phone. It's actually one of my alarms.
5205000	5206000	I would say...
5206000	5207000	And for the record...
5207000	5211000	I would say the GameCube was actually a little better than the PlayStation.
5211000	5212000	But I loved...
5212000	5218000	Like the PlayStation was one of those like theater sound tests you hear before the beginning of the movie.
5218000	5219000	You know, like...
5220000	5221000	Like the THX.
5221000	5222000	Yeah, the THX.
5222000	5224000	It was totally like the THX thing.
5224000	5230000	And for the record, if no one knows, Tom Luke's Japanese name is Tanukichi.
5231000	5232000	So there you go.
5233000	5234000	Do you know what I learned about...
5234000	5236000	And you probably already knew this, but I didn't know this.
5236000	5240000	I learned this today about Animal Crossing and the funny localization thing.
5240000	5247000	The reason why the turnips are the stock market is that the word for turnip and the word for stock are the same.
5247000	5248000	I didn't know that.
5248000	5249000	Yeah.
5249000	5250000	I never do that until today.
5250000	5252000	Of course, to me, they're just stonks.
5252000	5253000	Yeah, no, I know.
5253000	5255000	And I was just always like, oh, it's just silly.
5255000	5256000	It's turnips, you know, whatever.
5256000	5257000	It's a silly game.
5257000	5259000	Oh, that's clever.
5259000	5260000	How about that?
5260000	5263000	I actually wasn't really surprised at all.
5263000	5265000	Because, you know, the character Cap'n...
5265000	5267000	I was like, oh, he's a Kappa.
5267000	5269000	And that was his name in Japanese.
5269000	5275000	And to go ahead and let people know, the little indentation on his head is because Kappa have a bowl of water built into their heads.
5275000	5282000	And the way you defeat a Kappa is to give him a cucumber and he will be thankful and bow and the water will spill out of his head.
5282000	5283000	He loses his powers.
5283000	5285000	I thought he just had a giant bald spot like me.
5285000	5287000	Girl.
5287000	5288000	All right.
5288000	5289000	Anyway, let's move on.
5289000	5291000	Do you have water sitting on top of your head?
5291000	5292000	Are you really a giant?
5292000	5293000	Not in the...
5293000	5294000	You don't know it?
5294000	5295000	You don't know what's under this hat.
5295000	5303000	Anyway, let's move on and let's get into the next story.
5303000	5304000	Loki.
5305000	5306000	All right.
5306000	5308000	So this is pretty cool.
5308000	5324000	Since we've been talking about the Final Fantasy 7 remake and is obviously one of the bigger games of the first part of this year, it should be not as big surprise that Square Enix has reported that they have shipped 3.5 million copies.
5324000	5329000	Oh, I guess that's shipped and sold digitally because now we're including those.
5330000	5344000	So that's pretty much as a pretty decent size amount already and kind of hopefully that will be enough to them because I remember like back when they were like Tomb Raider and stuff, they were not so satisfied with the sales of that.
5344000	5350000	But being that this is something they're kind of lauding, I would imagine that it's good news for them.
5350000	5357000	Well, there was an article that was comparing some of the sales and like God of War in the same timeframe was like 3.1 million and that was a huge game.
5357000	5364000	We just had Jamie talk about Animal Crossing moving 5 million units, although I believe that captured an entire month.
5364000	5367000	And this is just capturing three days.
5367000	5369000	Yeah, we're not done with the month yet.
5369000	5373000	But I mean, we don't have to compare like who's got the bigger Wang.
5373000	5379000	You know, these are both incredibly well sold games in this type of era.
5379000	5386000	So I feel like it's enough to justify the game's existence and make sure a part two will come.
5386000	5389000	Oh, yeah. I'm sure the sequels are going to be coming.
5389000	5396000	For sure. Because I don't think Final Fantasy 13 sold 3.5 million in the same time frame. Maybe it did. I don't know. I'd have to go back and look.
5396000	5400000	And we ended up getting two sequels for that. So, you know, we'll see.
5400000	5403000	Yeah, 3.5 million. That's great. That's a great number.
5403000	5407000	So, yeah, people people wanted that Final Fantasy 7 remake real bad.
5407000	5409000	That they did for several years.
5409000	5414000	All right. Well, another game people are wanting real bad apparently is Valorant.
5414000	5418000	You know, that's the riot shooter game that's a little bit Overwatch-ish.
5418000	5424000	We talked a little bit about it on last week's show because we were talking about some of the anti-cheat system and how some of that was controversial.
5424000	5432000	Well, this week we're talking a little bit about two different sides of Valorant and some of the problems that Twitch is having because of the beta key handout system.
5432000	5439000	If you were not aware, one of the ways to get into the Valorant beta is to watch people play it on Twitch for what, like two hours?
5439000	5443000	And then you can possibly get a beta key. I'm not sure if it's guaranteed or if it's possible.
5443000	5449000	Oh, you have to watch at least two hours and I guess then you get the drop or whatever.
5449000	5457000	But what's happening is that you have these Twitch channels that are streaming Valorant 24-7 but they're not really there playing it.
5457000	5466000	Like it's just them sitting there or it's just, you know, maybe somebody running a rerun of an old stream but they're not using the rerun mechanism to do it.
5466000	5470000	They're streaming it like it's live. And so they're doing all these like weird things to kind of game the system.
5471000	5480000	And then of course you have those really shitty people that are doing things like if you go sub for my stream you'll get a better chance at getting a key or something.
5480000	5485000	I don't know. I don't know what these people are doing. But there's always somebody that's going to try to take advantage of somebody else.
5485000	5497000	Please remember you do not have to pay other Twitch streamers anything in order to get a Valorant beta key or really any type of key unless the publisher's official Twitter says something.
5497000	5508000	Like I think Blizzard did something like this once where you got a skin when you watch certain people's streams but the official Blizzard account tweeted about it and had a whole thing on what to watch and when.
5508000	5517000	If the official Riot or Valorant account isn't saying it, it ain't true. So just remember that as you go on your search for a beta key.
5518000	5527000	ActDeft in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network saying, oh yeah, I heard of this. They're using the video on demand and restreaming it like if it were live. Yeah, that is another thing that people are doing.
5527000	5533000	But no matter which way you slice it, you know, there's a lot of people doing it legitimately too. Let's not focus on the bad news.
5533000	5536000	But that is happening. It is an interesting side effect of this mechanism.
5536000	5542000	But the other interesting side effect of this way of distributing the game is it's getting huge views for Valorant.
5542000	5547000	And it's one of the top viewed games on Twitch right now, which is a great way to get people talking about your game.
5547000	5556000	Valorant is one of the top titles and usually has double what like Fortnite and Grand Theft Auto 5 and so forth have right now.
5556000	5561000	At least, you know, I know these numbers fluctuate depending on who's streaming and so forth, but it is doing very, very well.
5561000	5565000	And part of this is really because of, you know, how they're doing it.
5565000	5572000	Valorant now also has the title for the most hours watch of a specific game in a single day on Twitch with 34 million.
5572000	5582000	Combine this pandemic, we're all stuck at home situation with everybody wants to get a beta key and you got a recipe for why a lot of people are doing this.
5583000	5592000	And this game is like a legit win if you're like basically incentivizing your people to watch your stream to get something like that.
5592000	5594000	That seems a little ridiculous.
5594000	5601000	It is, but it's not like they're the first to do it. Like I said, Blizzard has done this type of stuff before as well and many other companies do it.
5601000	5604000	And for what it's worth, you know, I'm not going to dog on the game because I haven't played it.
5604000	5607000	B, and I'm not going to watch somebody stream for two hours to do it.
5607000	5612000	I'm going to watch somebody stream for two hours because they're playing something and are a personality that I really enjoy watching.
5612000	5618000	However, you know, this game will come out of beta at some point and we'll all be able to play it openly.
5618000	5628000	And maybe I'll check it out then, but I still think it's kind of noteworthy because not every game takes off even doing that with the same level of success.
5628000	5634000	So it must speak to the strength of this game in particular and what people are drawn to with this game.
5634000	5644000	And you know, I will say that the launch of it and the timing of it and when they're doing this is at a pretty good time because it is kind of a competitor in the same space as Overwatch, right?
5644000	5656000	And Overwatch is kind of in a slow spot right now. Yes, I know they just released Echo, but let's be real, it's kind of a lame duck until Overwatch 2 comes out because that's the big thing we all know Blizzard's really working on.
5656000	5663000	And I'm sure, you know, when Overwatch 2 comes out, it's going to snatch wigs and break the records on Twitch all over again and all that stuff.
5663000	5667000	But until then, there's room in the space for something else to kind of sneak up.
5667000	5672000	So I think that's, you have all these different factors I think as to why Valorant is succeeding.
5672000	5679000	But one of the biggest things we can ignore is that, you know what, the game is pretty good and people like it well enough.
5679000	5686000	You could say the exact same thing about like Apex Legends all happened before Fortnite did their 2.0 and all that, right?
5686000	5690000	So, you know, sometimes it's a good time to strike.
5691000	5699000	Questbuster in chat says, it was funny seeing one streamer that had massive Valorant numbers run with drops not enabled as a stream name for a while.
5699000	5705000	And then their numbers had several tens thousands fewer viewers than they used to have. Wow.
5705000	5711000	Hype Mayhem says, I've been watching Valorant for years since it was called Counter Strike Go.
5711000	5713000	Oh, I think that's shade. All right, anyhow.
5713000	5720000	So at some point I'll have to check this game out. I liked Overwatch well enough and I'm willing to check out, you know, some of the competitors and what they bring.
5720000	5726000	I tried that Paladins for a little bit. That was interesting. And I know our buddy Flaco Jones is a huge fan of that and streams that occasionally.
5726000	5734000	So, you know, there's room in the pool for multiple shooter games to do well. So good luck to all of you.
5734000	5737000	But don't run fake streams just to get more viewers.
5737000	5746000	Like that's, you know, look, I'd love to have more viewers and subs here at Vaga Network, but there's lines I'm just not willing to cross.
5746000	5751000	OK, so we want to be ethical in the way we're doing things. All right.
5751000	5755000	Anyhow, let's move on. Let's go to let's go to something more traditional.
5755000	5761000	Every week here on Orange Launch Radio, we like to take a look back down memory lane and spotlight one classic game of the week.
5761000	5769000	Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and says, hey, hey, this this system has a pretty cool splash screen and a pretty cool game.
5769000	5774000	You should be playing on it. So Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
5774000	5778000	Well, I think we're about to make active after really happy because it's Kirby's Dreamland.
5779000	5783000	Yay, I freaking love this game.
5783000	5793000	So Kirby's Dreamland is a side scrolling action platformer that was developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy.
5793000	5799000	It came out in 1992. It is the first Kirby game and the debut of Kirby.
5799000	5806000	I am currently surrounded by four, five Kirby's. Six. Six Kirby's right now.
5806000	5812000	One of them you got me, Rob. Hello?
5812000	5820000	Sorry, I used this opportunity to run to the kitchen, but yes, I was like I wasn't getting any feedback, so I was making sure that I was coming through.
5820000	5824000	You're good. I mean, see, this is a camera trick because the camera's not on me, so I don't have to be sitting there.
5824000	5828000	So anyway, but yes, I did get you a Kirby when I was in New York. Yes.
5828000	5836000	Yes, I love my Kirby pillow. But at any rate, Kirby's Dreamland was developed by none other than Sakurai Masahiro.
5836000	5841000	He also gave us the Smash series, of course.
5841000	5850000	So it had so much that was involved in it. It really was quite the dynamic game, I think so.
5850000	5862000	So moving on with this one, it was considered an action platformer and it had side scrolling, two dimensional levels.
5862000	5869000	You had your foreground and your main ground and everything. And the way that Kirby rules is by sucking.
5869000	5875000	Yeah. So his main method of attack is to inhale enemies and objects.
5875000	5879000	You know, he's basically every two year old. Don't put that in your in your mouth, except he does.
5879000	5885000	So so at any rate, and by the way, going back to what Fifth Dream asked, who came first, Kirby or Yoshi?
5885000	5891000	There was concept for Yoshi Run for Super Mario Brothers 2, so I think Yoshi was conceived first.
5891000	5900000	Anyway, going back to Kirby, basically, he would also, you know, to attack other enemies,
5900000	5906000	he could spit the enemies back out or he could swallow and digest them slowly for 10,000 years.
5906000	5914000	Oh, sorry, that's the Sarlacc. Anyway, the other things that he can do is that by sucking in just air,
5914000	5920000	he can hover and, you know, inflate himself and fly a little bit.
5920000	5928000	But the only way he can attack is to release that puff of air, which would cancel his flight.
5928000	5934000	So you kind of think of it like, you know, an air bladder and how fish stay afloat kind of.
5934000	5940000	Anyway, the game has five levels and the levels are actually made up of rooms,
5940000	5945000	which, you know, honestly, pretty novel concept for a platformer.
5945000	5951000	So each of these different rooms lead Kirby to a different area.
5951000	5955000	And some of them are doors to hidden places or different pathways.
5955000	5959000	You can beat the levels in different ways. The doors act as your checkpoints.
5959000	5963000	So if you if you die in the game, you don't have to restart the level.
5963000	5969000	You just return to the room that you were in. Excuse me.
5969000	5976000	You know, and the way, though, that Kirby would suffer damage is if he touches an enemy or a dangerous object,
5976000	5982000	he'll lose his hit. Depending on the enemy or the object, he would lose more or less.
5982000	5985000	If all of them are lost, he falls into a bottomless pit.
5985000	5990000	And then you lose your life after you start that, you know, that doorpost that you came in.
5990000	5995000	So, of course, losing losing them all, game over, yada yada.
5995000	6003000	And Kirby Kirby's Dream Land had very traditional power ups because, you know, in this one,
6003000	6008000	remember, he didn't have the copy abilities in later games. This was the first one.
6008000	6014000	So he could pick up different food, like spicy curry, gives fire breath or a mint leaf.
6014000	6020000	In Japanese version, the sweet potato would get puffs of air rather quickly.
6020000	6027000	He could let out that losing flight. And then there was the boss levels, you know, so he could obtain the sparkling stars.
6027000	6037000	Most bosses would be beaten by, you know, sucking up a projectile or an object to throw back at them.
6037000	6042000	Although one of my favorite ones was and actually it's even mentioned in the thing that I'm looking at,
6042000	6048000	was Kabula, where it's basically a shooter level. So that's pretty cool.
6048000	6056000	Yes, I guess says the Japanese name Hoshi no Kage, which is basically Kirby's dream.
6056000	6063000	So but anyway, or dream of course, I always get a little bit backwards.
6063000	6067000	But at any rate, you could also accumulate points and get items.
6067000	6071000	You could get extra lives if you have enough points, but it doesn't have to save functions.
6071000	6078000	You can't really save your game. You have to start over, you know, old school, no battery backup.
6078000	6085000	So and yes, I will be getting to all of these facts after. Thank you very much.
6085000	6091000	So like I said, it was developed by Sakurai Masahiro of HAL Laboratory.
6091000	6095000	Kirby was supposed to be a placeholder character.
6095000	6100000	He couldn't really, you know, they were going to make something a little bit more sophisticated.
6100000	6108000	Right. And he was called Popopo and they were going to call the title Twinkle Popo.
6108000	6111000	Although it looks like it's Tinkuru Popo, which would be Tinkle Popo.
6111000	6121000	So go big. But at any rate, he was named Kirby and the game was renamed Hoshi no Kabi or Kirby of the Stars.
6121000	6128000	I always you know what? Another thing about Hoshi is it could also I think mean wish.
6128000	6134000	So I kind of like the double name on it at any rate.
6134000	6145000	So they decided to make him pink and Miyamoto actually thought he should be yellow, but not Nintendo agreed with Sakurai.
6145000	6153000	So he has always been pink and a yellow Kirby has denoted the second player when you're doing multiplayer.
6153000	6160000	So moving forward, music was done by Ishikawa Jun, who has been the regular composer for the Kirby series,
6160000	6165000	even on the most recent one, Kirby Star Allies, which I need to get my own copy of.
6165000	6171000	I borrowed Jamie's copy, like indefinitely, and then finally gave it back.
6171000	6179000	But even some of the songs have been reused, like in Smash Brothers and in the green green stage of Super Smash Brothers Melee.
6179000	6189000	So it's all over the place. But at any rate, the game has an aggregate score of 62.22 percent on game rankings, nine reviews.
6189000	6196000	So it's on that ranking alone is 17 best gameplay games with a 62.
6196000	6202000	Yeah, I don't know people. That's not a very good score. I mean, but nine reviews, though, Rob.
6202000	6206000	Yeah. Who cares? People go to sleep more reviews. Who cares what they think?
6206000	6216000	But Kirby's Dreamland as of May 20th, 1995, sold one point three million copies and to date over five million copies worldwide.
6216000	6221000	And honored for having innovations in the platformer genre.
6221000	6232000	So we do have that. It has basically the game being successful was also attributed somewhat to Iwara Satoru,
6232000	6243000	you know, our long lost Nintendo boss who said had a very simple minded passion for creating games and really love this kind of game.
6243000	6247000	And it was also considered to be a fun yet relaxed game.
6247000	6253000	Some people said it was too elementary, but I think those people are wrong. You know, it's meant to be fun.
6253000	6257000	Well, I think it being on the Game Boy is a good boost as well,
6257000	6263000	because, you know, we forget how transformative the Game Boy really was to making portable gaming a thing.
6263000	6268000	Portal gaming was really not a huge thing until the Game Boy made it huge.
6268000	6270000	You know what I mean?
6270000	6277000	Well, and again, it was the first intro into it. I think it really laid down a great foundation for a series of games.
6277000	6285000	I mean, I really thought that Star Allies was way fun and it kind of brought back a lot of what I loved about the first game.
6285000	6289000	But at any rate, we have some bigger games.
6289000	6295000	So starting at the beginning, the first sequel was Kirby's Adventure for the NES,
6295000	6302000	which was the first game that introduced power stealing, and I think I've done Kirby's Adventure for a classic game.
6302000	6312000	We have had spin-offs like Kirby's Air Ride, a pinball game called Kirby's Pinball Land, a golf hybrid called Kirby's Dream Course.
6312000	6319000	Kirby's Dream Land had a sequel in 1995 called Kirby's Dream Land 2 that had the coffee mechanic from Kirby's Adventure.
6319000	6328000	Kirby's Super Star had a shortened remake of Kirby's Dream Land called Spring Breeze, as I said, beautifully mentioned in chat.
6328000	6334000	And it did have the coffee ability, and you could summon helpers for co-op.
6334000	6341000	But it was, of course, missing the Castle Lololo stage and the Kabula boss fight, which the Kabula fight is one of my favorites.
6341000	6346000	And instead, La La La became the boss for Float Island instead.
6346000	6354000	Kirby's Super Star Ultra had an expansion with Revenge of the King, a harder version of Spring Breeze.
6354000	6360000	And by the way, you could unlock the hard mode for Kirby's Dream Land, just saying.
6360000	6367000	So you also have Kirby and King Dedede as characters in Smash Brothers,
6367000	6376000	and they have their alternate costumes that are monochrome, that look like Game Boy's graphics, and even some of the levels.
6376000	6378000	I was like, it's Whispy Woods!
6378000	6380000	So yeah, there you go.
6380000	6390000	We have one of, I think, the best games ever, not just a Game Boy game.
6390000	6396000	This game is classic, and it's classic for a reason, and I probably should have done it a while back,
6396000	6399000	but this has been the month for me going, why did I do that game?
6399000	6401000	Or did I do that game?
6401000	6404000	Yeah, this is you rediscovering all the games you haven't done as Classic Game of the Week.
6404000	6407000	So, I mean, I know you've done other Kirby games. You've done several other Kirby games.
6407000	6408000	I did Kirby's Adventure.
6408000	6409000	Yeah.
6409000	6411000	I think I've only done Kirby's Adventure.
6411000	6414000	But not this one. Well, there you go. There it is, your Classic Game of the Week.
6414000	6417000	Who doesn't love Kirby? Besides Zach Def, we all know he loves Kirby.
6417000	6423000	And everyone who follows me on Twitter or one of the sacred few on Facebook,
6423000	6430000	I think I did recently post the first level music.
6430000	6436000	Every iteration of it that had ever existed in a game, I think I posted it on my Twitter last night.
6436000	6438000	So, enjoy.
6438000	6443000	Now, you said as part of that, one of the original names of that was Tinkle Lolo, was it? Tinkle something?
6443000	6447000	It's written as Tinkaroo.
6447000	6448000	Ah, well-
6448000	6451000	But they're saying, they're calling it Twinkle Popo, but it's written Tinkaroo.
6451000	6456000	It made me think of Tingle, which of course made me think of Loki, which made me think of, and I didn't know this,
6456000	6460000	did you know there's a Tingle outfit in Animal Crossing?
6460000	6462000	It was in my 80s today.
6462000	6464000	Oh, are you talking about the Kappa outfit?
6464000	6468000	No, it's like, they call it the Sprite, or what is it called, the Sprite outfit?
6468000	6471000	Oh, yeah, the Sprite. Yeah, there's like a pink one and all the other colors.
6471000	6475000	It's definitely a Tingle outfit. You just need that.
6475000	6476000	That's great.
6476000	6479000	Anyway, Dark Soccer, I think you have to peace out because of work, right?
6479000	6482000	Did you want to do your rapid-fire stories real quick and then say goodbye?
6482000	6486000	Yeah, sure, and we also do have a couple of emails, but I'll leave those for you.
6486000	6487000	I can read those, yeah.
6487000	6488000	Because I'm kind.
6488000	6489000	And make sure you empty the trash when you're done.
6489000	6492000	Yes, I will not.
6492000	6498000	Anyway, the Pokemon company has released Pokemon backgrounds that you can use for your Zoom calls.
6498000	6504000	There is a Magikarp one, is that a Magikarp one? No, there better be a Mag-
6505000	6507000	Yeah, there's a Magikarp one, which I'm going to use.
6507000	6512000	If it doesn't work on WebEx, you know I'm going to use those two, but at work.
6512000	6516000	But at any rate, yeah, you can have all kinds of different, neat-looking Pokemon backgrounds.
6516000	6521000	There's a Mew and Mewtwo and all kinds of stuff. It's really cute.
6521000	6531000	And then there's also going to be, dun, dun, dun, a new Splatfest, and it is a rematch.
6531000	6540000	Splatoon 2 Splatfest is happening in May, and it is, again, mayonnaise versus ketchup.
6540000	6543000	Mayonnaise better win, because ketchup is gross.
6543000	6550000	Ugh, disagree. Mayonnaise won the first time, which was a travesty, so maybe this is ketchup's chance to take its rightful crown.
6550000	6555000	Yeah, but maybe it's the more superior Japanese mayonnaise, which has a bit more vinegar to it.
6555000	6556000	Ugh, anyway.
6556000	6558000	Oh, come on, Kewpie mayonnaise is amazing.
6559000	6565000	I will not be playing, because it was gross, because the things you're splatting actually look like ketchup and mayonnaise.
6565000	6569000	I'm sorry, I'm not going to subject myself to something to be splatted with mayonnaise. That's disgusting.
6569000	6572000	Yeah, that's how I feel about ketchup. Ketchup is disgusting.
6572000	6575000	Why don't we do, like, barbecue sauce versus mustard?
6575000	6577000	Because I don't like mustard.
6577000	6579000	I like them both, so...
6579000	6582000	You know what we need to do?
6582000	6583000	Huh?
6583000	6588000	Because I'm thinking of, uh, pancakes. We need peanut butter versus syrup.
6590000	6594000	I don't know a lot of people to do peanut butter, but it's not... I'm not opposed to that idea.
6594000	6596000	People don't do peanut butter?
6596000	6599000	I don't know a lot of people to do peanut butter. It's, like, always syrup.
6600000	6607000	Okay, before I go, I have to tell you what my newest food, like, obsession has been, because I eat waffles every morning now.
6608000	6609000	Waffle.
6609000	6613000	I eat waffles. And I have been taking unsalted cream butter...
6613000	6618000	Dan! Dan! Dan! Waffle.
6618000	6620000	And drizzling raw honey over it.
6621000	6622000	Yum.
6622000	6624000	And it has been a delight. The end.
6624000	6626000	You're welcome. Go eat.
6626000	6633000	Alright, Dark Soccer, thank you for being on the show. I mean, you're always here, but I feel like I need to say thank you anyway.
6633000	6637000	Do you have any last thoughts for our listeners before you head off to sleeping for work?
6637000	6645000	Pray for me. I start back to work tomorrow, and I am apprehensive. Hello?
6645000	6646000	Yeah.
6646000	6647000	Did I kick myself out?
6647000	6648000	No, here, here.
6648000	6650000	No, I accidentally closed my Discord window. I'm like, oh, crap.
6651000	6663000	I am... I'm apprehensive, but I think I'm gonna do well, and my doctor is still like, hey, if you need to log off, do so, but then I go into training for a week.
6663000	6671000	So that means, again, not having to talk a lot, not being on the phone a lot, so I think a couple weeks, I'm making it through the show great today.
6671000	6675000	I only needed my inhaler once. So, let's take that as a good sign, right?
6675000	6678000	Yeah. Well, as you requested, here are some thoughts and prayers.
6678000	6682000	Oh, you know what? Thoughts and prayers do jack shit, so just give me money.
6682000	6688000	Okay. Maybe. We'll see. Alright. Thank you again, Dark Soccer. We'll see you next week.
6689000	6694000	Alright. Love, everybody. Love, EndoPisu, and reject false icons. Bye.
6694000	6697000	Bye. Loki, you got some rapid-fire news for us.
6697000	6705000	Sure do. So, Red Dead Redemption 2 is gonna be coming to Game Pass, so that's awesome, starting May 7th.
6705000	6710000	So, if you haven't got a chance to play the game, now you can play the game, at least if you have Xbox.
6710000	6713000	That would be me. I am a perfect candidate for this. Thank you.
6713000	6719000	You are, and you'll probably enjoy it. I don't know. I didn't enjoy as much as Grand Theft Auto,
6719000	6726000	because there's a lot of simulation stuff in it, like having to eat and sleep and do work and stuff like that.
6726000	6733000	I'd rather just go shooty-shooty-bang-bang, but, you know, I guess there's games for everybody.
6733000	6738000	This is where I need to get this on PCs. I can play with a trainer and then not have to do all that stuff.
6738000	6740000	There you go. That's where I need to do it. Now you're talking.
6741000	6749000	And then WWE 2K is skipping 2020. Apparently, 2K Games is gonna be sharing more details.
6749000	6755000	I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact that the last one sucked really bad. It was really a buggy piece of crap.
6755000	6761000	So, I'm sure it's just because of the COVID or something like that and not because it's absolute garbage.
6761000	6765000	But, we'll see. Nothing will be missed.
6766000	6773000	All right. Moving on to arcade archives. Do any of you like to download the arcade archive stuff on the Switch?
6773000	6780000	I think they have them on PlayStation 4. It's MAME that you pay for, but that makes it legal and okay.
6780000	6786000	So, downloading arcade ROMs on your Switch so you can take them on the go and PlayStation.
6786000	6789000	Then you get trophies and you get to use your good controllers and all that good stuff.
6789000	6796000	So, there are some new arcade archive games that are coming in April of 2020 this month.
6796000	6800000	So, I guess they better be out soon because I haven't heard of these games hitting yet.
6800000	6807000	But, these games include BurgerTime, Burnin' Rubber, Trio the Punch, and Darwin 4078.
6807000	6812000	You know I'm all about BurgerTime coming out. Maybe this is meaning they're confirmed now to come out in the near future.
6813000	6820000	Some other titles you may have forgot that were announced previously that still haven't arrived yet include Sunset Riders by Konami.
6820000	6825000	Versus Wrecking Crew was also one of those games that's supposed to be coming.
6825000	6832000	Guerrilla War by SNK and there's other stuff too. There's a lot of those arcade archive games if you weren't aware.
6832000	6836000	So, if you haven't seen them yet, go check it out because soon you get BurgerTime.
6836000	6844000	Anyhow, one place that doesn't have arcade archive games yet, but maybe they'll get them, I don't know, is Google Stadia.
6844000	6849000	Yes, Google Stadia is still a thing and they are giving away that Pro Pack for two months if you weren't aware.
6849000	6852000	But, if you don't want to keep it, make sure you cancel it.
6852000	6857000	However, they're about to do a stream and that stream is coming up on April 28th.
6857000	6859000	So, that is what? That's like in two days, right?
6859000	6868000	So, two days. So, in two days they're going to be doing the stream and the stream will be at 9 o'clock Pacific time, 9 a.m.
6868000	6874000	and 12 o'clock Eastern time and 5 o'clock or 6 o'clock depending on what time zone you're in overseas.
6874000	6877000	It is new Stadia Connect. We have no idea what they're going to be announcing in it.
6877000	6881000	We would theorize that they could have some new exclusive games they're revealing.
6881000	6889000	My thought is it should be about the time that Google is talking about how non-pro subscribers can get into it.
6889000	6895000	Especially in the state of the world that we're in right now, I think there's more people that want to take advantage of it.
6895000	6904000	And yes, I know they have that two-month offer, but when do I just get to, without a pro subscription or whatever, fire up my browser and play Stadia?
6904000	6910000	So, maybe this is going to talk about kind of that future of what Google Stadia looks like. That's my thought anyway.
6910000	6915000	But we'll see. And of course, some really good games are going to get some eyeballs on it, so we'll see.
6915000	6921000	I hope they're not just announcing, ooh, we got these games that have been on other platforms for two years.
6921000	6925000	Because that's what killed the Wii U, y'all, and hopefully Google learned from that.
6925000	6931000	Okay, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates. I know things are a little slow right now, but we'll talk about it anyway.
6931000	6933000	Loki, what do we have in the U.S.?
6933000	6941000	There's some stuff coming out. So we have Gears Tactics coming out on PC, moving out on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6941000	6949000	Sakura Wars on PlayStation 4, No Runner on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6949000	6954000	Telling Lies on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6955000	6961000	We have Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered on PC and Xbox One.
6961000	6968000	And Street Rage 4 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6968000	6974000	And then there was a digital game I was going to mention as well coming out called Pocket Arcade Story from KeroSoft.
6974000	6980000	You may remember them from such games as, of course, Game Dev Saga, or Game Dev Story.
6980000	6985000	So that was a fun little iOS game and Android game. Now that's going to be on the Switch.
6985000	6990000	Neat. Going over to Japan, kind of slow on the Nintendo Switch this week.
6990000	6994000	The only title I see coming out is Moving Out is coming out on the Switch this week.
6994000	6999000	Going over to the PlayStation 4, there's not a lot there either.
6999000	7003000	I guess it's a very slow week over in Japan, probably due to what's going on in the world.
7003000	7008000	So no real big releases to speak of this week in Japan. How about the UK, Loki?
7009000	7013000	UK, we've got Sakura Wars coming out on PlayStation 4.
7013000	7019000	Moving Out as well on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.
7019000	7023000	I don't think this is coming out, but they still have it listed there.
7023000	7026000	Fast and Furious Crossroads, I believe that's probably been delayed.
7026000	7031000	Daymare 1998 Black Edition on PlayStation 4.
7031000	7036000	And a game called Arcade Spirits, which is on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.
7036000	7040000	And I was trying to look at that because the little icon looks like a little Taito thing or something.
7040000	7050000	But apparently it is some sort of visual novel set in a world where the 1983 video game market crash never happened.
7050000	7052000	Oh, interesting.
7052000	7054000	It's a romantic comedy.
7054000	7056000	It looks interesting.
7056000	7058000	Okay. Fascinating.
7058000	7061000	Alright, I guess you'd have all this commercial shovelware garbage.
7061000	7067000	I mean, not to say that stuff doesn't exist today, but that's what really killed the Atari 2600 was, you know, like anybody could make a game for it.
7067000	7073000	So you had like the Purina dog chow game and like all these like really like crap shovelware type of games.
7073000	7077000	And that's why Nintendo, when they released in the US, had the seal of quality.
7077000	7081000	And, you know, it's the crash is very interesting.
7081000	7084000	And we're getting because of it thrown out the window once the week came out.
7084000	7089000	Yeah, right. I'd be very curious, like kind of what their take on it is.
7089000	7092000	So I'm curious about their narrative on that crash never happening.
7092000	7095000	I think that's a very clever idea for a game.
7095000	7097000	All right, let's move on to emails.
7097000	7099000	Every week you guys send us emails.
7099000	7102000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us emails.
7102000	7104000	And we read some of our favorites here on the air.
7104000	7106000	And we do have some emails this week.
7106000	7107000	We have a couple of good ones tonight.
7107000	7112000	I mean, all the emails we get are great, but it's always nice to have some really good talking points in your emails.
7112000	7119000	So let's get to our first email tonight from Redertainment, who says, hello, peoples, and then links us to an article that he discusses.
7119000	7124000	This week, World of Warcraft unveiled official controller support for the first time.
7124000	7129000	I'm curious what people with more MMORPG experience than I feel about this move.
7129000	7137000	Could this lead to an expansion of WoW to the consoles or just making the game more accessible to players through methods that they're already familiar with?
7138000	7144000	I believe Blizzard responded to this on their official forums and insisted it's more about accessibility
7144000	7149000	and that you're not going to be able to do everything in the game via a controller.
7149000	7153000	And this is not some type of thing to take on Final Fantasy XIV.
7153000	7157000	But, I don't know, there's a part of me that kind of says, yeah, right, to a lot of that.
7157000	7164000	And the fact that maybe they're having to give in a little bit because every other MMO that's out there right now is for PC.
7164000	7173000	Even things like Black Desert, which is a pretty big MMO that I haven't personally played a lot of, they exist on consoles as well as PC.
7173000	7180000	So I think they realize that maybe by having that controller they might be able to lure a few more people into it.
7180000	7185000	I don't know if WoW is going to feel great with a controller because the game just wasn't designed with that in mind.
7185000	7191000	I think it's an interesting pivot, but I'll be curious to see what kinds of things they let you do with a controller.
7191000	7197000	And I'm all for accessibility. I mean, if it's going to let more people play WoW, then I think that is a great thing.
7197000	7200000	So, yeah, let's see where they go with it.
7200000	7203000	Anyway, moving on with Redertainment's email because there's more.
7203000	7209000	Also, have you people been experimenting with crafting your own recipes during our time of social isolating?
7209000	7213000	I've come up with my own cocktail recipe, the Double Ginger Double Martini.
7213000	7217000	Ooh, I love ginger drinks. You know, my favorite drink, my absolute favorite drink is a Moscow Mule.
7217000	7223000	And that's because I love ginger stuff. But it has to be served in the little copper mug to keep it cold.
7223000	7227000	So, anyway, the Double Ginger Double Martini.
7227000	7230000	Two parts vodka or rum, depending on your preference.
7230000	7233000	One part ginger beer. One part ginger honey syrup.
7233000	7238000	Combine the ingredients into a cocktail shaker, shake, then pour into a glass of your choice and stir.
7238000	7240000	Because why the fuck not?
7240000	7246000	Because Roberts, Rob Roberts, prefers shaken, not stirred. Just saying.
7246000	7251000	Finally, thanks again for posting episodes of OLR on Spotify.
7251000	7255000	You're welcome. Thanks to Spotify for having us and thank you guys for listening.
7255000	7261000	And stay care, Redertainment. This message has been brought to you by the Double Ginger Double Martini.
7261000	7263000	Well, it sounds like a very good drink.
7263000	7267000	So, I will, I don't really keep a lot of alcohol at home.
7267000	7271000	I have like a little bit of wine. But maybe we can go forth into the world again.
7271000	7273000	I can talk to some of my alcoholic friends.
7273000	7278000	I keep thinking about every time I go to the store, I'm like, I should grab a bottle of something.
7278000	7282000	Right? It's, yeah, I still have like bottles of wine.
7282000	7285000	I can't open wine because Alan doesn't drink at all.
7285000	7288000	And I'm not going to get through a bottle of wine by myself. Like, I'm just not.
7288000	7291000	Like, I'll pass out by the time I'm halfway through. Anyway.
7291000	7295000	Next email. Maaten from Belgium emails us saying,
7295000	7299000	Hello, LR. Maaten from Belgium here.
7299000	7303000	You were talking last week about games to stay fit with during the COVID lockdown.
7303000	7305000	I've been playing a game called Zwift.
7305000	7311000	It's basically an MMO cycling game in which you ride an indoor bicycle with other people around the world.
7311000	7314000	You just run the game on your laptop or iOS device.
7314000	7318000	The game connects via Bluetooth to your indoor trainer setup.
7318000	7324000	You just use a regular bicycle hooked up to a smart trainer, which sends your power data to the game.
7324000	7334000	The trainers range anywhere from about $180 for the cheapest to over $1,000 for setups that simulate hills, road surface, et cetera.
7334000	7336000	Oh, things that must like vibrate and do resistance. That's interesting.
7336000	7340000	You can sign up for virtual races or just join a friendly group ride.
7340000	7344000	The game has chat. Players give each other little thumbs up, encouragements, and so forth.
7344000	7348000	You see the little flags for players around you that show which country they're from.
7348000	7353000	Anyway, it's an extremely fun way to race your friends virtually or to stay fit during lockdown.
7353000	7355000	Thought it would be interesting to share.
7355000	7357000	Thanks for continuing the shows and stay healthy.
7357000	7359000	All the best. Maaten from Belgium.
7359000	7360000	That's pretty cool.
7360000	7363000	Yeah, there was a picture that was attached to this.
7363000	7365000	If you want to look it up, it's called Zwift.
7365000	7367000	So think Zwift but with a Z.
7367000	7370000	Yeah, I was looking at it and it looks pretty cool.
7370000	7374000	I mean, that $180 for the cheap one price tag kind of scares me.
7374000	7378000	And this might shock you. I don't own a bike.
7378000	7385000	I used to, but it got stolen when I was in college and I just never replaced it because bike thieves are assholes.
7385000	7390000	But yeah, I never really picked up another bike, which is kind of a shame because we live in a really good biking town.
7390000	7394000	Like they actually have protected bike lanes downtown, which you don't see everywhere,
7394000	7399000	which means like you have the bike lane and then or like, no, what is it?
7399000	7403000	The cars are parked. You have the bike lane, then the parked cars.
7403000	7407000	So that way people like can't hit you in the bike lane. It's kind of fascinating.
7407000	7410000	So, yeah, I should get a bike.
7410000	7413000	Maybe I should put that on my birthday list, but I don't have one.
7413000	7419000	But this sounds like a neat setup. I like I love the idea of gamifying it and making it a little more virtual.
7419000	7425000	I'm, you know, also here where we live, we're surrounded by all these river trails.
7425000	7428000	And so it would be hard to tell me to not bike out.
7428000	7431000	But I guess transporting a bike can be a pain in the ass.
7431000	7434000	You have to bike to the trail before you can really get on the bike trail.
7434000	7437000	But I don't know. People ride a long, long way on those bikes.
7437000	7441000	But I think that was neat. I think there's a neat little thing that more people should check out.
7441000	7444000	So Zwift is where you can check that out.
7444000	7451000	All right. Again, if you want to email us for a future week, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your email.
7451000	7453000	We'll be looking forward to some emails next week.
7453000	7458000	In the meantime, a few more stories for you guys. Let's go to Loki.
7458000	7467000	All right. So let's talk a little bit about I swear it's like a constant topic with Nvidia streaming service and what it's losing.
7467000	7473000	So more games, unfortunately, are being removed from their service starting this week.
7473000	7481000	So apparently they have lost games from Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment, Xbox Game Studios,
7481000	7489000	which I mean, that makes sense with their own streaming services, Codemasters and Clay Entertainment.
7489000	7494000	They're going to they have been removed as of Friday.
7494000	7498000	So that kind of sucks. So what does Nvidia have left on their streaming service?
7498000	7502000	I don't know. But see, their streaming service is not necessarily I mean, it's your own library.
7502000	7511000	So it's basically these companies just saying, hey, yeah, we know that you purchased this stuff already, but we're just not going to let you.
7511000	7520000	Well, isn't it more the fact that Nvidia is charging their five dollar a month fee and game companies are, I guess, not are not happy that they're not getting a part of that.
7520000	7528000	Although I thought they maybe it came up in a preview because this story's come up a few times now because what Blizzard took their stuff off and, you know, in Activision, of course, a part of that and so on.
7528000	7532000	So we've got all these game companies that took their games off the service.
7532000	7544000	And, you know, there's like it came out one of the stories that they actually were getting a share of the profits, but it wasn't enough because people always want more profits.
7544000	7556000	Yeah. Well, whatever. You know, I'm sure they'll try to come up with their own game streaming services, and I'm sure no one will do it because it's going to be too spread thin.
7556000	7565000	Really what needs to happen is people just need to come up with, there needs to be some sort of independent solution that just does the whole Steam link, but like from afar.
7565000	7571000	I agree with pod culture in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network who says, how would this be any different from renting a computer?
7571000	7575000	Yeah. I mean, they didn't pull their games out of computer cafes. Right.
7575000	7580000	I know that's a stretch and that isn't really a part of our culture here in the US. Like, I know they exist.
7580000	7591000	Well, in this pandemic situation, they don't exist, but they exist. But certainly in like, you know, Korea and some of the Asian market, like computer cafes are very commonplace.
7591000	7599000	And so, I mean, I guess you also kind of pay for games on a time scale, but it would be weird if like you went to one of these places and you couldn't play games that you've actually bought.
7599000	7607000	You know what I mean? So I kind of, I think that's a good comparison. You're kind of renting somebody else's computer, right?
7607000	7623000	Not necessarily, but like, I get it. I don't know. I just, it doesn't matter to me because I'm like, I'm not going to use the service anyways because I would play on my PC, my laptop and wherever I'm going.
7623000	7633000	So if I'm going somewhere else, I wouldn't have access to it. I mean, I'm not going to want to try to even play a game, let alone like, you know, playing like order and stuff just drains my battery as it is.
7633000	7641000	I can't imagine what streaming a game on my phone would even do. It would just, it would like toast that battery.
7641000	7651000	All right, Bobby Black Wilson chat with the harsh dose of reality who says broadcasting over the internet is the issue. If you rent a computer, it's not broadcasting over the internet to you, but you're still broadcasting it over the internet.
7651000	7659000	It's not the computer that's the problem. It's the act of broadcasting it over the internet. Even if you're the only viewer, it's still being broadcast to you.
7659000	7672000	So, I mean, that's essentially what Google Stadia is doing as well. But yes, I mean, Google, that's why not every game is on Google Stadia and it's a different model. Yes, I understand the difference here is because, you know, you're buying those games on Stadia and that's part of the agreement.
7672000	7685000	Whereas here, you know, you're trying to play your existing library. So, but I mean, people broadcast tons of games here on this site on Twitch, and you don't necessarily see the kickback. But again, you're not, you're not playing it.
7685000	7699000	Oh, I know a good example though. Okay. How about PlayStation 4's SharePlay? Isn't that broadcasting too? And doesn't Sony, like by default, don't all the games on PlayStation 4 have that SharePlay thing going? And that's what you're doing, right?
7699000	7708000	You're broadcasting to one person, but it's like a privatized environment. You do have to have PlayStation Plus. So, maybe there's some type of money thing going on there.
7708000	7719000	Maybe something in the agreements with the game makers for PlayStation 4 are kind of like signed into that. But that is worth acknowledging. SharePlay's kind of a similar setup, right?
7719000	7734000	Bobby says, Sony has the broadcast rights. Nvidia does not pay for broadcasting rights and the publishers can turn it off. I suppose, yeah, I do, I will say this, the entire last chapter of Final Fantasy 7 Remake, the broadcasting thing flips off.
7734000	7746000	I wasn't broadcasting or anything. But you actually, because you get a screenshot every time you get an achievement, and every time you beat a chapter in the Final Fantasy 7 Remake, you get an achievement, a little trophy pops up, right?
7746000	7757000	So, the trophy popped up for the last chapter, chapter 17. And then it said, unable to take screenshot, because you know, your PlayStation 4 always takes a screenshot when you get a trophy, because this scene is blocked.
7758000	7772000	So, I suppose you're right. SharePlay could be blocked as well. I didn't try doing that. Maybe I should try doing that. Anybody beat Final Fantasy 7 that wants to see? I'm assuming it doesn't work. That that's probably part of what goes with it.
7772000	7782000	And Bobby does say, Atlus goes after streamers who stream too far in Persona 5. Well, that's a bummer. But that is, yeah, that is something that has been in the news before as well.
7782000	7792000	All right. Moving on. Let's move on to Xbox and some things that they're doing and Series X. And everybody wants to know, where's more games for Series X?
7792000	7800000	Because we know Hellblade, As soon as Sacrifice 2, and that whole thing is happening. But I don't think we've had a lot of announcements outside of that.
7800000	7814000	And in a tweet this week, because that's the way we get news now is on Twitter, Phil Spencer, the head of Xbox, talked about what is happening with Xbox Series X, saying, reviewed plans yesterday for continued sharing through launch.
7814000	7823000	Team is doing great work and adapting. I've never been more excited about Xbox plans. We've heard you. You want transparency and authenticity.
7823000	7837000	We plan to keep showing that way. Next step is not too much of a wait. And then in parentheses, games. So, yeah, it's kind of teasing that we know you want more information and you'll get it soon.
7837000	7850000	But we don't know when soon is. Although one could certainly theorize, well, in a non-pandemic world where COVID wouldn't have happened, E3 would have happened in June and Microsoft was still planning on participating in that.
7850000	7860000	June is not that far away at this point. We're talking less than six or about six weeks, right? So, I mean, is there a plan to just do things during the week E3 would have been?
7860000	7865000	Maybe with some of these people that have stepped in to fill in for E3, such as IGN and so forth. What do you think, Logie?
7865000	7878000	Either that or around the same time. I'd imagine that any time between now and probably June is when we're going to hear something. So, I don't think it's hard to imagine that that's going to happen.
7878000	7885000	I don't know if they would necessarily do something through IGN per se, but like I could see them doing their own event around that time.
7885000	7894000	Yeah, I think that's a good point. They'll probably do their own event, but they might supplement with IGN because IGN will still, you know, they're a media outlet. They're still going to be all about exclusives.
7894000	7905000	So, if they get, maybe the trailer gets unveiled at a Microsoft event, but then IGN gets, oh, here's the deeper exclusive on Fable 4 first gameplay outside the trailer.
7905000	7914000	I'm obviously making that up. That's on my wish list of things I would like Microsoft to announce, but let's say that, you know, IGN gets first look at Fable 4 gameplay. They'll still do it as part of their event, right?
7914000	7924000	Even though Microsoft might show the trailer at their own thing that they're going to stream on Mixer and, you know, what have you, easily available on Xbox One and so forth.
7924000	7938000	They've done that even with like E3 stuff where they'll have like the exclusive trailer at the PlayStation event and then, but we're going to get some extended footage or different trailer on the Xbox event or Activision or whatever.
7938000	7950000	Maybe Microsoft needs their own tree house. Like, cause that's what Nintendo does. They show the trailers in their little 30 minute direct and then, oh, Nintendo tree house for three days will give those deeper dives and so forth.
7951000	7953000	Yeah. We can bring back the space ponchos.
7955000	7963000	Hey, I love that E3. The space, the Cirque du Cirque du Connect, that whole thing with the space ponchos. That was rad.
7966000	7976000	Man, good times. You know what? What I'd give, what I'd give to be rid of this COVID shit and back into the era of space ponchos when that was the joke. All right. Anyway.
7977000	7988000	Uh, moving on, uh, dark soccer had to leave and she was going to talk about this, so I'm probably not going to do this story justice. I apologize in advance, but this was kind of more one of those like human interest stories involving games.
7989000	8002000	Uh, a nine year old Italian boy has created a game during this whole lockdown situation because of course, uh, Italy has been going through it a lot of what you're seeing here in the U S you know, Italy had it really bad.
8002000	8016000	Uh, those first few weeks when we were just starting some of our shut-ins and lockdowns and so forth. So the folks in Italy had been locked down for some time and a fourth grader has taken this time to actually create a video game to play with friends online.
8017000	8027000	And again, another reason why I think this is nice to bring up is because it shows that whole art coming from crappy scenarios type of situation.
8027000	8035000	You know, yes, it is fascinating that a nine year old did this and insert the joke here about how a nine year old finished his game before Loki. It's the easy.
8036000	8042000	Yes, but that's because he, he picked something small to do, I'm sure. And, and he's also a nine year old that doesn't have a daytime job.
8043000	8052000	Right. But the reality is, is that not only did the nine year old create a game, the nine year old created a game that was kind of about COVID-19 being the backdrop here.
8052000	8062000	Uh, the name of the kid is Lupo Da Turi. I hope I said that name right. Sorry if I didn't. Uh, he lives on the outskirts of Milan and of course they've been on lockdown since March 8th there.
8063000	8069000	And so he said, I had to stop all the sports I did because of COVID-19. I can't even go to the pond with my dog.
8070000	8079000	Instead of playing sports, skiing, swimming, karate, I have to make do with an exercise bike. So he did some online tutorials and made a game called Surba 20.
8079000	8090000	It's a search and destroy type of game and you have lasers, but you're in the captain's chair of the Surba 20 spacecraft and you are fighting COVID-19.
8091000	8099000	You know, again, the kid is nine. It's fine to have a simple plot for a game. A lot of great games have a simple plot. Go back to anything on the Atari 2600.
8099000	8109000	Okay. Uh, so Lupo, uh, the, the child Lupo talks out, he's playing with his friends and now wants to do a project on how to teach his friends how to program so they can make their own games.
8110000	8117000	Um, he's getting requests from his teachers to program things, not just games. And that's according to his father. That's very fascinating.
8117000	8127000	Um, what's interesting, uh, I guess folks, there might still be a negative comment, connotation. If you play a lot of video games, you're a nerd.
8128000	8135000	Uh, because his mom, uh, commented, I'm not worried because my son is not a nerd, happy because he's passionate about something that can help him.
8136000	8141000	The fact that he invented a game that has gone viral makes me happy because it motivates him to do even more.
8141000	8149000	So, uh, there you go. Uh, a, a COVID-19 commentary piece by a nine-year-old called Serba 20.
8150000	8157000	Meanwhile, I'm struggling to get out of bed on the weekend. So you gotta, you gotta tip your hat to this kid and, uh, congratulations.
8158000	8165000	And maybe he'll continue to make awesome video games in the future. If he likes sports, maybe he'll program sports video games when he grows up. Who knows?
8166000	8168000	All right. Anyhow, uh, look, you want us to take the next story.
8169000	8186000	All right. Um, so you may remember when, uh, Fortnite was released on Android that they went about some way where you have to side load it basically onto your device in order to get around having to put it on the Google Play Store.
8187000	8196000	Well, apparently they have decided that after 18 months of being without it, that they're going to go ahead and take part and put it on the Google Play Store.
8196000	8206000	Um, because apparently, you know, despite the fact that they're not, they're going to lose a third, that 30% cut that Google takes, it's, I guess, better exposure.
8207000	8218000	So Google put software, uh, downloadable outside of Google Play at a disadvantage through technical and business measures such as a scary repetitive security pop-ups for download and updated software,
8219000	8237000	restrictive manufacturer and carrier agreements and dealings, Google public relations, characterizing third party software as malware and the new efforts such as Google Play Protect outright block software obtained outside of the Google Play Store is one of the reasons why they felt pressured to put it on there.
8237000	8252000	Uh, they said, we hope that Google will revise its policies and business dealings in the near future so that all developers are free to reach and engage in commerce with the customers on Android and Play Store through open services, including payment services that can compete on level playing field.
8252000	8263000	Well, I'm sorry to tell you that's never going to happen because on the Apple side of the house, you know, there's the whole iOS, um, you know, app store that you can't get around that either.
8263000	8274000	And the fact that you could get around the Google Play Store at one point was kind of a nice bonus, but they don't have to do that. So yeah.
8274000	8288000	And I know, I was just to say, I know Apple takes a lot of crap for things having to go through their store, but at the same time, you know, for the most part, it means the quality is there and you don't have a bunch of, you know, things trying to hijack your phone to mine Bitcoin and things like that.
8288000	8298000	Not to say it's perfect, you know, things have snuck through the store that probably shouldn't have, but they it's, it's, it's usually in the news and notable each and every time that happens, you know, so there's, there's gives and takes.
8298000	8302000	Yeah.
8302000	8310000	So it's a good, at least to be a little bit more accessible to folks. Um, but I know that's not ideal for them.
8310000	8331000	It's interesting though, because you would think at this point, like if you haven't tried Fortnite, are you ever going to, so it's interesting that they, I guess, believe that this is going to open it up to more people putting it on their phone, but they must have really seen like, you know, maybe comparing to iOS and so forth. Like people just aren't installing Fortnite on their Google phones, uh, androids the way they would on other platforms, I guess.
8331000	8357000	Well, look at, look at your target demo, like is, you know, children playing the game. Do you, I know a lot of children are pretty tech savvy, but even my kids who use technology all the time, they wouldn't know how to do it. I'd have to load that thing on their forum. So, um, I mean, hell, they don't even know what updates are sometimes when they get pop up message on the switch to update software. So it's, it's very understandable.
8358000	8383000	It's a barrier to entry for some of the more casual players on the platforms and stuff, especially if you're playing a game like Fortnite on a phone or on an Android device like that. I mean, I don't want to categorize someone as more casual doing that, but you know, I would think that the folks that are on a PC are probably a little bit more knowledgeable on how to do stuff. Plus it's definitely a lot more accessible on PC, whereas this was still a barrier to entry.
8383000	8398000	And with all the popups, you know, and especially if you're a parent and maybe not too tech savvy yourself, you're like, Oh, I don't know. It's telling me that I shouldn't do this. I, I'm very hesitant of wanting to put it on here. So I can see why they want to get around that.
8398000	8413000	All right. Well, one more story for you guys before we wrap up for the night, and that has to do with Guild Wars. That's right. Guild. I'm not even talking about Guild Wars 2. I'm talking about the original Guild Wars. Did you know that game is about 15 years old? It's celebrating its 15th anniversary.
8413000	8428000	And right now going on in the game, there is a celebration on Embark beach going on in Guild Wars with 10 new weapons, one for each profession on sale for the anniversary vendor and a new trophy that lets you spawn a boss in one of the four end game location.
8428000	8440000	The bosses are not new, but they have new skills. They get, I guess, icons from Guild Wars 2. So kind of trying to, you know, I guess bring some of the Guild Wars 2 into the old Guild Wars, just even if only visual.
8441000	8457000	And obviously a lot of people from the original game have moved on to Guild Wars 2, but you know, part of the reason why people love Guild Wars is that it didn't have a monthly fee. So if you bought it, you can log in right now and play it. If you can remember your login or you still have it installed somewhere and check out the anniversary. So pretty cool.
8457000	8476000	By the way, if you want to know how popular Guild Wars 2 was, estimated about 1.5 million in 2018. So probably only a fraction of that still on the old school Guild Wars. But I think that is really cool that they are adding some stuff for the anniversary to help people celebrate and acknowledge the game.
8476000	8490000	You know, why not? Blizzard has World of Warcraft classic and you know, sometimes people like to go experience the old games again, which reminds me, are we ever going to get an update on the future of Final Fantasy 11? I don't think so. I'm starting to think no at this point. It's just done.
8490000	8499000	Disappointed. Yeah, a little bit. All right. If you have any questions for us, I'm going to open up the round table in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network.
8499000	8511000	If you have any questions or general statements for our show tonight, please feel free to ask away over twitch.tv slash vog network. Probably not going to do calls tonight. I'm looking to wrap up here in the next few minutes, but please, if you have any questions, go ahead and ask there.
8511000	8521000	And I know Loki probably has a couple of last minute stories that he wants to get to. I think I do. I thought there was at least one or two stories we didn't put on the show tonight.
8521000	8538000	Uh, sure. Let's take a look here. Uh, I will, let me read some comments from chat to buy you time here. Um, uh, Phoenix 77 26 in our chat says, Rob Guild Wars one had a different skill system to Guild Wars two that many old players think is a lot better.
8538000	8549000	Yeah. The games did play a little differently. And you know what? Anytime you release a sequel like that, like even when they did EverQuest two, there was still going to be people that are going to be loyalists to the old EverQuest.
8549000	8558000	And that's why there's not going to be a world of Warcraft two. I bet I would be, I would be very shocked if they ever did a world of Warcraft two. If Blizzard wanted to do another MMO, they'd use one of their other properties or something.
8558000	8574000	They're not going to make a world of Warcraft two because there's just going to be people that are stuck on World of Warcraft Warcraft. They just, or, or what you see, I guess what you really see happening because this is what's happening at Blizzard is that they evolved the game through so much through its expansions that people long for the way the game they used to be.
8574000	8581000	So you have World of Warcraft classic and now World of Warcraft the way the game is now. So it's kind of, I guess, different evolution patterns in that way.
8581000	8597000	Phoenix is also asking, do we have any idea on what WoW's current numbers are? No, because Blizzard stopped releasing those numbers because they were slowly going down and down and down and everybody was screaming doom and gloom. So they just stopped putting the numbers out there.
8597000	8606000	So, um, no, we don't know. And we don't, we don't really know. And when Final Fantasy 14 reports numbers, they only report the number of accounts. They don't really talk about what's active and what's not.
8606000	8620000	It is assumed right now by some that Final Fantasy 14 is the dominant MMO, but we don't know. Nobody's putting out the numbers to justify it. We just, we have to rely on like third party data that analyzes what people are playing. And otherwise we don't know.
8621000	8629000	They should have totally done in like an April fool's joke that say that they're going to put out Final Fantasy 14 classic. It's the version one.
8629000	8643000	There's, there's people that want that. There's people that are asking for that. And I'm like, okay, if you think World of Warcraft classic is through some Rose colored glasses, then let me tell you, Final Fantasy 14 one sucked ass and you don't want it.
8643000	8656000	Like you, you think you want it. You don't want it. It's bad. All right. Can we call 14 class or 11, 14 classic and just bring that back? Yeah. Bring 11 back. That's well, 11, 11 tightly hasn't gone anywhere.
8656000	8668000	It's still there. Uh, just not on PlayStation or Xbox anymore, but it's still cooking along on the PC. So, um, bonds, double six is saying no Pokemon go news. I don't, I don't think they have any major news this week.
8668000	8679000	Um, I don't know if that's teasing us cause we tend to talk a lot about what's going on in Pokemon, go on the show. Uh, they did, they did a community day. They had the Auburn community. I, I did a little bit of it from home. I didn't catch a single shiny and I was, I was kind of over it.
8679000	8690000	I haven't played the game in a long time. I just, yeah. Yeah. I guess, I guess their news would be that that community day happened at home. I liked that it was a nice big window to play it though. I wish they were all like that.
8690000	8700000	Yeah. So, uh, I was going to mention though, uh, we talked a little bit last week about Corona relief done quick because that was going on while we were recording the show or at least it just about wrapped up.
8700000	8719000	So they had succeeded in raising over $400,000, um, towards that, um, their charity as well. So that's pretty awesome. I was watching a little bit of the, um, uh, the YouTube clips during the week. So that was pretty cool. Uh, summer games done quick.
8719000	8740000	Currently scheduled for August 16th through the 23rd. So we'll have to wait and see what happens there. Um, and then this was kind of cool. I saw this mod that was put out for Mario 64 called super Mario Odyssey 64, which basically includes several Mario Odysseys worlds like sand loss in Bowser's kingdom.
8741000	8760000	Uh, they have 80 moons in there plus cappy mechanics as well. And the different characters, um, or the different, um, mobs and stuff from the game as well. So, uh, go find that out on the, uh, internets as well. Thankfully, this is one of those cases where, Hey, mods done.
8760000	8766000	Now I'm going to talk about it and release it before you can get your C and D. So good times.
8767000	8779000	A hype mayhem is mentioning in our chat at twitch.tv slash vog network. You forgot to mention that the source code to team fortress two and counter-strike go were leaked and left players open to hacking. If an exploit in the source code is found. I did hear about that.
8780000	8798000	Yes. And I remember, um, valve had said it wasn't such a big deal because it was really old source code. And so I don't think that anything, um, a lot of the code has changed since then. So they didn't feel that it was going to leave them open to vulnerabilities or anything.
8799000	8808000	Yeah. It does seem they're trying to laugh it off and sweep it under the rug, but, uh, I guess, I guess the only way we will find out is if hackers actually succeed in exploiting the game based on what they find in there. So we'll see.
8809000	8820000	So, yeah. All right. Well, if that's that, then we're going to go ahead and start to wrap up the show tonight. We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts. Uh, first off, thank you guys so much for listening to our program.
8821000	8829000	Whether you were here live with us at twitch.tv slash vog network on Sunday night, or you listen to us on the podcast feed throughout the week, however you participated with the show, we really appreciate it.
8829000	8838000	Um, tell a friend or two about the show, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice. But, um, if the voices aren't here to put on air, how can we possibly, you know, share more voices?
8839000	8850000	Uh, auto hosts on things like Twitch go a long way. Let me tell you a nice five star reveal on iTunes or things like that. Also love that as well. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you to everybody that goes the extra mile, uh, with all of that stuff.
8851000	8853000	Um, final thought time, Loki, your final thought.
8854000	8869000	Uh, my final thought is I'd like to work more on my game this week. I did work on a little bit on it, um, but not a whole ton. Um, mainly because I'm switching from computers and everything is kind of put me back behind the things.
8869000	8885000	And, um, I was toying with different art styles and stuff and using different tools to build levels. So, um, I found that my importer that I was using for the voxel stuff isn't working quite right. So I've got to kind of redo that.
8886000	8891000	So that's putting me back a little bit, but, uh, I'm still trying to get in the swing of things and do it on a more regular basis.
8892000	8910000	All right. Um, my final thought is, um, now that I've beaten Final Fantasy 7 Remake, I need another 30 hour game to play through. I guess I still have Nier and that seems like the one I'm going to gravitate to, but I also know me and I feel like I'm gonna like, it's time to get back on my Final Fantasy 10 bullshit or Final Fantasy 12.
8911000	8919000	And I'm probably going to go back and revisit one of the classics cause I just know how I am. Uh, and that's probably what I'll end up doing, but we'll see, stay tuned. I'll let you know what happens in seven days. Sound good?
8919000	8936000	All right. Uh, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Thanks again for tuning in. We will see you next week when we do it all over again. Uh, in the meantime, stay safe, uh, stay indoors, help stop the spread, wash your hands, all that good stuff and, uh, take care of yourselves.
8937000	8943000	That's really all we can ask and have fun gaming online and all that good stuff. Be nice to other people when you play online. Take care. See you next week.
