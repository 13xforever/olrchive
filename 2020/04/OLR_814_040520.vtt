every gamer has a voice it is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 814 for this

00:42.280 --> 00:48.840
April the 15th excuse me April the 5th not 15th getting ahead of myself of 2020. My name is Rob

00:48.840 --> 00:53.000
Roberts joining you here live of course with everything that's going on in the world we are

00:53.000 --> 00:57.480
still doing the social distance thing so it's just me in the studio tonight usually my co-host

00:57.480 --> 01:03.240
would be here live in studio with me instead I'm joined by Captain Pikachu and via discord we have

01:03.240 --> 01:10.200
welcome back tonight please DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Hello. Hi I hear that you're doing a lot

01:10.200 --> 01:17.720
better? Yeah I'm doing better enough that they deem I can work tomorrow morning if I can ever get

01:17.720 --> 01:24.520
the stuff I need from my work computer set up here at the house but yeah my I had a chest

01:24.520 --> 01:31.800
x-ray and it came out clear they should have given me the chest x-ray three weeks ago but you know

01:31.800 --> 01:40.280
it is what it is so she thinks that the breathing problems I have left over just inflammation from

01:40.280 --> 01:47.240
having had pneumonia. Wow so but you never did find out if it was the big one or not just because

01:47.320 --> 01:54.680
the testing shortage right? Exactly and I probably won't get to find out until they have the antigen

01:54.680 --> 01:59.080
test ready. Well whatever way you slice it I'm really glad to hear you're feeling a lot better

01:59.080 --> 02:02.360
because I know that was kind of you know if you go back and listen to that show it was about three

02:02.360 --> 02:07.080
weeks ago or so when you were first calling in and you were you were feeling sick you you really

02:07.080 --> 02:10.040
didn't sound good so I'm really glad to hear you're you're doing a lot better really really

02:10.040 --> 02:13.800
happy to hear it and I know a lot of folks over in our twitch chat are cheering you on as well

02:13.800 --> 02:17.800
because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock pacific nine o'clock eastern

02:17.800 --> 02:22.840
at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network right after of course the Bobby

02:22.840 --> 02:27.560
Blackwolf show. Also joining me in studio though I want to talk about Bobby's show tonight actually

02:27.560 --> 02:31.640
with who else is also joining me excuse me on discord not in studio we'll usually be in studio

02:31.640 --> 02:36.440
but not tonight say hello to tech master Loki our virtual studio say hello to Loki.

02:37.320 --> 02:43.320
I was gonna say I'm not there. Yeah in spirit or I've been in quarantine for three weeks now

02:43.400 --> 02:47.800
where Pikachu is just starting to look like Loki I don't know what it is maybe I don't know how

02:47.800 --> 02:54.280
are you doing Loki? It's the jaundice it must be the jaundice. Clearly how are you doing? I'm fine.

02:54.280 --> 02:59.560
So Bobby's show tonight he had a really big night because he had Tommy Tallarico on tonight who is

02:59.560 --> 03:06.600
the CEO of Intellivision and I don't did you hear the whole interview Loki? No I like how like the

03:06.600 --> 03:10.440
last five minutes. Oh bummer you should have heard the whole thing because there was a point where

03:10.440 --> 03:16.280
Bobby actually brought up some of the things we had talked about on OLR before so and I won't

03:16.280 --> 03:20.120
repeat everything because I know Bobby's want to get that interview out there but Tommy actually

03:20.120 --> 03:25.400
addresses some of those things about the whole like remember the the no 3d games thing although

03:25.400 --> 03:30.920
that's not really what it is he kind of clarifies that quite a bit and then he talks about the whole

03:32.120 --> 03:36.680
average score thing which I guess people interpreted to be a 70 score a metacritic

03:36.680 --> 03:41.160
but it's actually like an internal type of rating like think Nintendo CL quality type of thing

03:41.160 --> 03:46.760
but anyway it was it was a good interview Bobby and Tommy had a lot of conversation and Tommy's

03:46.760 --> 03:52.600
great he's a great salesman pitching his product and makes a lot of good cases for the Amico and

03:52.600 --> 04:01.400
I can say I put down the deposit on one Thursday so I'm excited to check it out. I looked at it but

04:01.800 --> 04:07.240
I don't know I don't know if I'm gonna do that. All right well it's I can also understand who's

04:07.240 --> 04:10.200
one of those things where you got to get your hands on the games that the games are the important

04:10.200 --> 04:14.520
part and I thought it was interesting how he kind of said like he actually said this may not

04:14.520 --> 04:18.040
really be or this is what I heard anyway sorry I don't want to I don't want to misattribute a quote

04:18.040 --> 04:22.040
or anything but kind of the message I was hearing was you know if you're like a hardcore gamer this

04:22.040 --> 04:26.680
may not really be the thing for you like that's not the thing that we're designing it for so

04:26.680 --> 04:30.760
that's the message I heard anyway so I thought that was interesting that you know he did have

04:30.760 --> 04:34.680
that kind of like realistic approach like he definitely knows the audience he's going for and

04:35.240 --> 04:37.800
I think it's I think it's very interesting he makes a good case when he kind of says

04:38.360 --> 04:44.920
your your best memories in gaming are usually when you're together in the same room you know you

04:44.920 --> 04:48.600
think back to days of like you know playing Mario Kart or things that you would play like in the

04:48.600 --> 04:52.200
same room those are your great gaming memories and he wants to be able to bring those back and

04:52.200 --> 04:56.840
when was the last time you were able to play a game with your family members your parents your

04:56.840 --> 05:00.920
you know extended family members probably Wii Sports or something like that so I thought I

05:00.920 --> 05:05.240
thought he made some really good arguments for the direction the console is going I thought it

05:05.240 --> 05:11.240
was really good so so props to him and also I I have no idea if Tommy's still watching you

05:11.240 --> 05:16.520
probably turned it off by now but uh kind of an interesting little aside about Tommy and

05:16.520 --> 05:21.720
video games live specifically uh video games live and not everybody maybe necessarily knows

05:21.720 --> 05:25.720
I think I might have mentioned it once before on the show but video games live is actually where I

05:25.720 --> 05:30.840
met my husband Alan for the first time we knew each other online like on a blogging site years

05:30.840 --> 05:35.720
and years ago but it was actually due to video games live that we met face to face for the first

05:35.720 --> 05:38.680
time there was a chance meeting we didn't know that the other was going to be there it was one

05:38.680 --> 05:43.800
of those type of oh you're oh you're that and it kind of like things proceeded from there as they

05:43.800 --> 05:49.640
say so I do I do have Tommy to thank for that for creating video games live because if I hadn't had

05:49.640 --> 05:55.800
that chance meeting who knows what would happen so um pretty cool anyhow let's get into uh and I

05:55.800 --> 05:59.640
will just say tune into Bobby's show for the rest of it it was it was a good interview and I know

05:59.640 --> 06:05.960
he's putting that up on youtube as well as his podcast feed usually um the video content here

06:05.960 --> 06:09.640
at vog network we kind of see that as something extra because we've been doing these podcasts for

06:09.640 --> 06:15.400
a long time 15 years 18 years uh we've been doing podcasting a long time so the audio podcast they're

06:15.400 --> 06:18.680
out there free as they have always been but when we made the move to twitch we thought you know

06:18.680 --> 06:23.160
video is something extra so we're gonna put that uh with the subscribe subscription thing and most

06:23.160 --> 06:28.840
of you have a twitch prime uh account anyway so you get one free subscription uh excuse me amazon

06:28.840 --> 06:33.560
prime um account so you get a free twitch prime subscription every month so if you consider using

06:33.560 --> 06:38.760
that at vog network you get access to the whole video library but because uh this is such a big

06:38.760 --> 06:43.400
thing and and there's really important news uh and things to be seen tommy did really show off

06:43.400 --> 06:46.920
that controller and kind of it was showing it from all angles and stuff so there is kind of a

06:47.000 --> 06:51.800
video component to that so he's gonna put that on youtube for free so that way it's not gated

06:51.800 --> 06:56.280
because uh we don't want to be we don't want to be absolute uh jerks here at vog network and we don't

06:56.280 --> 07:00.920
want to put the good stuff behind the paywall we're not we're not the la times putting all the

07:00.920 --> 07:06.600
good stuff behind the paywall anyway let's move into tonight's kickoff topic something else a

07:06.600 --> 07:11.400
little different going on in the gaming world um obviously with all the news around us we've got

07:11.400 --> 07:17.480
things that are being cancelled moved shifted and all that stuff left and right and uh loki

07:17.480 --> 07:22.360
e3 kind of or lack thereof providing some uh different moving and shaking this week right

07:22.360 --> 07:29.000
loki right i mean so it's kind of expected that a lot of stuff around e3 well e3 already being

07:29.000 --> 07:37.000
cancelled um is being postponed or cancelled as well so to go along with e3 as um we've had in

07:37.000 --> 07:42.760
the past few years uh bethesda won't be doing their digital event around june um so they're

07:42.760 --> 07:49.640
working on some alternate plans as well um to go along with that though we've got ign announcing

07:49.640 --> 07:55.320
that they're going to be doing their own digital event called the summer of gaming uh it's supposed

07:55.320 --> 08:02.360
to be a collaboration between several different companies 2k square enix sega bandai namco amazon

08:02.360 --> 08:11.480
google stadia twitter developer digital thq nordic and more companies and you know they're

08:11.480 --> 08:17.000
basically going to have some sort of event that's gonna be kind of i guess showing off some games

08:17.000 --> 08:25.080
maybe some of the footage that we would have gotten during e3 but aren't getting um no deadline

08:25.080 --> 08:29.400
or no exact date on when that's gonna happen but i'm assuming sometime during the summer

08:30.040 --> 08:36.440
and last but not least we've got esa talking about their plans for e3 2021 with the date being set

08:36.440 --> 08:43.800
already from 15th through the 17th june 20 of 21 and they said it's going to be their reimagined

08:43.800 --> 08:50.760
version of e3 whatever that's supposed to mean so i don't know but it is it is interesting they're

08:50.760 --> 08:55.320
using the word reimagine so that's where they're kind of setting the expectations is that this is

08:55.320 --> 09:00.600
going to be a different show when it comes back in 2021 so the cancellation you know certainly

09:00.600 --> 09:06.200
i i think covid and and the the global crisis we have going on there i think that was going to get

09:06.200 --> 09:11.640
e3 eventually one way or the other but um i think it definitely goes to show that some some of this

09:11.640 --> 09:17.080
other thought about how to reinvent a show um may have come into play with that you know again i

09:17.080 --> 09:21.880
think the pandemic would have claimed the show eventually um but it is you know a lot of people

09:21.880 --> 09:26.600
when they pulled the plug it did seem still kind of early on um so it's just kind of interesting

09:26.600 --> 09:32.440
that they definitely are looking at what is the show going to look like in the future um right

09:32.440 --> 09:36.360
and then i was going to say also to kind of clarify i dig it i did find the information

09:36.360 --> 09:41.320
about the ign event that's supposed to take place in june as well yeah and it's it doesn't

09:41.320 --> 09:46.360
it strike you as very i don't it's it's oddly opportunistic of ign isn't it i mean i'm not

09:46.360 --> 09:51.480
that i'm saying like they're doing anything wrong i mean it's a it's a smart business move but it

09:51.640 --> 09:58.440
is interesting that ign is jumping on that before the esa because wasn't the esa supposed to announce

09:58.440 --> 10:04.440
a digital event or wasn't the esa supposed to be doing their own thing i thought i don't remember

10:04.440 --> 10:09.000
if that's i thought that was a thing or not well they kind of um it was like they said look forward

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
to this but they never like confirmed it's happening here it's this time it's just kind of

10:13.000 --> 10:18.520
one of those we're figuring it out as we go along type of things right and i guess you know it could

10:18.520 --> 10:23.960
be that they're just trying to get you know more traffic to their i mean obviously they're trying

10:23.960 --> 10:28.520
to get more traffic to their site because they make a lot of money from these collaborations

10:28.520 --> 10:35.000
with different companies for advertising um i mean i'm sure it's just all kind of a lot of um patty

10:35.000 --> 10:40.200
in the back and stuff like that but i don't know we'll see how the coverage is i mean i don't really

10:41.000 --> 10:45.480
it's been so long since i've been to ign i went there today i'm like wow their sites really

10:45.480 --> 10:52.040
changed because it's been like months if not years since i've been to ign well but i mean

10:52.040 --> 10:57.560
even though i say it's a little opportunistic i mean it's smart because you know clearly if they

10:57.560 --> 11:02.360
were able to sign on the dotted line to get all these companies to commit to doing these types of

11:02.360 --> 11:08.840
reveals um at an ign event then clearly the esa had not thought to sign them all already which is

11:08.840 --> 11:14.440
a severe lapse in judgment on their part uh yet another in a string of bad decisions by the esa

11:14.440 --> 11:19.880
sorry but i'm calling it like it is um so ign was able to step in there smartly and get all

11:19.880 --> 11:25.640
those uh people to sign off and now essentially they are taking the hat of being the uh digital

11:25.640 --> 11:31.000
e3 even though they can't call it that but that is essentially what they're doing and now ign can

11:31.000 --> 11:37.720
basically cock block everyone else and you know they have the exclusive video will be you know

11:37.720 --> 11:41.400
going to their site to see all that stuff although we all know that shit will get ripped and put on

11:41.400 --> 11:46.360
youtube and what have you but you know essentially ign is going to make their site the place to go

11:46.360 --> 11:52.280
to see all of that which you know hey digital journalism kind of needs a lot of help and that

11:52.280 --> 11:57.480
stuff right now so again i'm not like shaming or saying it's a bad thing on ign it's it's

11:57.480 --> 12:01.880
fucking smart but it's interesting that they were able to do it is what i'm really saying

12:04.280 --> 12:09.720
so yeah i mean i it's not surprising that they would take the opportunity to do that but

12:10.120 --> 12:15.000
we'll see how the coverage is i really don't care i like my information and i feel that with all

12:15.000 --> 12:18.600
these announcements that things are getting postponed and canceled that we're not going to

12:18.600 --> 12:24.680
hear a lot until at least you know uh gamescom and so i don't know it'd be nice to hear something

12:24.680 --> 12:29.560
during june i mean nintendo wasn't listed as one of the companies participating obviously because

12:29.560 --> 12:34.440
they have their own thing that they're doing so it'll be interesting to see i thought a lot of

12:34.440 --> 12:39.240
these companies were going to be doing kind of that like you know kind of the treehouse life type

12:39.320 --> 12:46.360
of um coverage where they're just going to stream some information or gameplay for a few days um

12:47.240 --> 12:50.520
i don't know well i guess we'll have to wait and see what happens well yeah and it was also

12:50.520 --> 12:55.240
interesting because um you know a lot of folks were saying the e3 and i guess maybe i'm one of

12:55.240 --> 13:01.160
these folks e3 was kind of all digestible online anyway like you know many of us would sit here and

13:01.160 --> 13:06.280
watch the digital press conferences online uh we would be watching the videos as they're released

13:06.280 --> 13:10.360
online it's almost like you know you could get more out of the show sitting here watching it

13:10.360 --> 13:15.640
online than you actually could um at the la convention center which is you know what what

13:15.640 --> 13:21.880
broke me on e3 and why i stopped going was when i had to fight my way to get in to see this uh

13:21.880 --> 13:26.200
demo of a new assassins creed game that was just on youtube later that night you know it was kind

13:26.200 --> 13:29.720
of like well if i can just consume all this stuff online anyway then what am i what am i spending

13:29.720 --> 13:34.520
all the money to come to la for well the parties were always pretty good but you know realistically

13:34.520 --> 13:38.360
i can't spend that kind of money and time just to party you know i can party here at home

13:39.000 --> 13:46.360
so this is you know kind of kind of interesting how this may be pushing e3 to where it was at

13:46.360 --> 13:52.040
anyway so i'm at least encouraged to hear the e3 uh and the esa kind of gets the memo

13:52.680 --> 13:57.880
because sometimes i worry about that and that they are going to reimagine it for 2021 i'm just

13:57.880 --> 14:02.920
so curious what that would look like and to be quite honest i'm not sure i have the answer

14:02.920 --> 14:08.840
um maybe it is somewhere in that hole you know we like to party we like to get together um the

14:08.840 --> 14:13.000
people that i know that still like to go to e3 are like well i like to see all my industry people

14:13.000 --> 14:18.760
it's the one time of year i get to see all those people so maybe e3 turns into something a little

14:18.760 --> 14:25.000
more like twitch con but it's not twitch it's the whole industry kind of thing it's kind of that's

14:25.000 --> 14:30.200
kind of where i see e3 kind of going not just twitch con but everything else gone i don't know

14:31.160 --> 14:37.880
we'll see uh we'll see what develops uh in the coming weeks and months ahead uh june all things

14:37.880 --> 14:42.440
considered is not that far off it's only what about seven eight weeks off i guess it depends

14:42.440 --> 14:47.400
what part of june they're going to be doing so we'll see and then of course you know the the

14:47.400 --> 14:52.600
world situation we're facing is also rapidly developing we don't necessarily know what that's

14:52.600 --> 14:56.520
going to look like in in three or four weeks or even by the time june gets here i mean obviously

14:56.600 --> 15:01.240
our fingers and toes are all crossed that we get on the other side of this you know thing within

15:01.240 --> 15:05.880
the next month but i think you know we're kind of mentally preparing some of us for the fact that it

15:05.880 --> 15:10.600
could go on excuse me a little bit longer uh and the reason why i say that is because you know

15:10.600 --> 15:14.680
we're looking to games com maybe to deliver some of the news a little later in the summer but

15:15.240 --> 15:19.400
maybe there won't be a games com either don't know i mean just because this thing is over

15:19.400 --> 15:22.840
does that mean we can suddenly have conventions with thousands of people again that may not

15:22.840 --> 15:27.000
necessarily be the best idea i don't know i'm gonna leave it to health experts and scientists

15:27.000 --> 15:33.000
and listen to what they have to say on the whole thing so anyhow um let's move on from e3 and talk

15:33.000 --> 15:37.320
a little bit about closer to home how was your gaming week and the types of video games that

15:37.320 --> 15:41.720
you've been playing this week i bet i don't have to guess very much what game dark soccer has been

15:41.720 --> 15:48.840
spending the most of her time on what are you up to i've been playing doom kidding cool that'll be

15:48.840 --> 15:54.840
good somebody finally played doom on the cast great playing animal crossing um and i got dan

15:54.840 --> 16:04.040
playing now too so dan lives on koholint island and uh i just i i visited a friend in australia

16:04.040 --> 16:09.720
right before the show so i have a couple of the southern hemisphere seasonal fish right now and

16:09.720 --> 16:15.640
well just a ribbon eel and a couple of the bugs um but the funniest thing is like when you catch the

16:16.200 --> 16:23.240
red dragonfly it says i didn't even have to roll initiative nice and that one's my favorite um

16:24.120 --> 16:29.960
and then um i started playing pocket camp again once i realized that there's like a code for stuff

16:29.960 --> 16:34.680
that they're gonna keep doing codes like this if you're playing both games so i started playing

16:34.680 --> 16:40.520
that again um and that's really about i did play a little pokemon go when i had to go to the doctor

16:41.480 --> 16:48.120
um and i'm disappointed because um i live just far away enough from the the gym that i can't

16:48.120 --> 16:53.560
hit it but i can hit the pokey stop in my neighbor's backyard and what i mean in my

16:53.560 --> 16:59.080
neighbor's backyard is it's actually at this uh this uh walking path or bike path that cuts into

16:59.080 --> 17:06.200
my neighborhood and there's a sign there and um and sometimes if my gps is being wonky i can hit

17:06.280 --> 17:12.120
it from the corner of my backyard um but now i can just sit in my bathroom and hit the pokey stop

17:13.080 --> 17:18.280
yeah they also doubled the distance of the gym thing so you can actually hit a gym

17:18.280 --> 17:24.280
from twice as far away as you used to be able to um which i know i did finish a gym battle oh nice

17:26.360 --> 17:32.360
yeah yeah sadly i'm just out of range of the closest gym to the house now but there's a second

17:32.360 --> 17:37.800
gym in the neighborhood i got a new um portal for ingress approved in uh opr or excuse me

17:37.800 --> 17:41.480
niantic wayfare and it made a new gym in the neighborhood on my walking so now i have two

17:41.480 --> 17:48.280
gyms on my walk path so it's great you should do my mailbox in my neighborhood uh i is it like

17:48.280 --> 17:53.640
painted or something special yeah oh okay it's like a well not painted but it's a it's a mailbox

17:53.640 --> 17:58.040
it's got mail on it i'll take a look if it's just a generic mailbox those usually don't meet

17:58.040 --> 18:04.200
criteria i probably won't go through okay yeah all right so if that's it for your gaming week

18:04.200 --> 18:12.360
then we will go to loki all right so i did play a ton of stuff uh this week so one of the things

18:12.360 --> 18:18.120
i did is i'm like i said i mentioned i was replacing my laptop because my old one's kind of

18:18.120 --> 18:26.760
dying so i got a nicer laptop um that it's got like an rtx 2070 in it and you know 32 gigs of ram and

18:26.760 --> 18:33.160
you know a nice i7 processor so i was um loading up vr games so i played a little bit of half-life

18:33.160 --> 18:39.720
alex and that's really immersive and fun so i really enjoyed that and then i finally got

18:39.720 --> 18:48.600
around to playing beat saber a bit so um not uh it's still you know getting used to that because

18:48.600 --> 18:54.440
it's quite hard to play it on normal and stuff so um it was pretty fun and then of course the

18:54.440 --> 19:00.520
big thing i did this week was convert over my uh ddr cabinet to run step mania so now i have

19:00.520 --> 19:06.040
a set medium machine with like 2 000 songs loaded in there so i did actually play some ddr this week

19:06.040 --> 19:10.680
and stuff can you go back to the old way if you want or is that a permanent change um it's not

19:10.680 --> 19:15.480
a permanent change this requires you know unhooking some things and plugging stuff back in

19:15.480 --> 19:21.560
um so yeah i could go back if i want um so it's definitely not permanent i wanted to get it like

19:21.560 --> 19:27.720
so that i could switch between the two but i that would require some more uh hardware and wiring

19:27.720 --> 19:33.400
stuff up but it's got everything going i mean uh the lights work and everything i bought a while

19:33.400 --> 19:41.080
ago a lighting board for it so that i could uh use set me to control the lights um but it looks nice

19:41.080 --> 19:46.520
um i did find out though that the tv that they replaced in there so there's an lcd tv in there

19:46.520 --> 19:52.840
um and apparently the remote doesn't work for it so i had to disassemble the front flex or the

19:52.840 --> 19:59.400
front like a glass that was on there in order to actually get to the uh the tv to change the

19:59.400 --> 20:04.760
settings on it which is kind of funny in order to get it to work with um how i have the computer set

20:04.760 --> 20:09.160
up but yeah it's been pretty cool and um i'm just trying to get everything organized right now

20:09.160 --> 20:16.440
because it's um there's a lot of songs in there and i need to organize it so i can get it down

20:16.440 --> 20:20.440
to a more manageable level because i just kind of dumped everything on there and there's a lot of

20:20.440 --> 20:25.880
duplicates and stuff too so uh that's what i've really been working on so can i ask you to expand

20:25.880 --> 20:29.400
on half-life alex a little more because you kind of mentioned that one really quick but you know

20:29.400 --> 20:34.600
since i i think many of us don't really have vr setups what makes half-life alex kind of like

20:34.600 --> 20:39.320
different than a traditional first-person shooter because i guess most people are probably thinking

20:39.320 --> 20:44.040
oh it's just a first-person shooter but you're in vr like what like what do they do that makes it

20:44.040 --> 20:51.080
like you can't do this on a monitor this is a vr game it's very immersive so like the physics

20:51.080 --> 20:55.080
in the game is really good so you can grab pretty much anything interact with pretty much all of

20:55.080 --> 21:01.560
the objects in the game um you can use them in very creative ways so for example um and i i

21:01.560 --> 21:06.600
don't remember what they're called but there's these creatures that have these giant like

21:06.600 --> 21:12.680
tentacle things that hang from the ceiling and so if you get caught by one of them you can

21:12.680 --> 21:18.120
basically get eaten so what you're supposed to do is you can throw things at them to have

21:18.120 --> 21:25.880
them grab those and they can walk by or you can wear like you can find um you know stuff on the

21:25.880 --> 21:31.880
ground to use to help you out as well like so for example there's construction helmets around so you

21:31.880 --> 21:37.000
can put a hard hat on um my kids were saying put the button there's a bucket on the ground so

21:37.000 --> 21:41.080
they're like put it on your head and yeah again once you put a bucket on your head if you really

21:41.080 --> 21:49.000
wanted to um you can grab markers and draw on the windows and stuff um you can you know pick up

21:49.000 --> 21:56.040
glass bottles and smash them you can i don't know you can grab like a explosive gas canisters and

21:56.040 --> 22:00.520
throw them at something and then fire a gun at it plus then you get gravity gloves later on so you

22:00.520 --> 22:05.720
can start grabbing you know things out of the air you can throw stuff up and catch it it's pretty

22:05.720 --> 22:13.320
cool um and then it's just very immersive both sound and atmosphere um it's really great it looks

22:13.320 --> 22:20.840
like the graphics look incredible like it's just a really great looking game um so i mean i i don't

22:20.840 --> 22:26.280
know i got to play for about like an hour or so today and it was just really fun okay cool no

22:26.280 --> 22:30.920
thanks i i was kind of curious a little more just because you know especially you know thanks to

22:30.920 --> 22:34.600
quarantine like you know i have a couple friends that i probably could go to their place and check

22:34.600 --> 22:39.240
it out you know play it but i i can't so i i kind of have to live vicariously through others right

22:39.240 --> 22:43.400
now with all this uh quarantine going on but when this is over hopefully i'll get a chance to check

22:43.400 --> 22:48.360
it out yeah definitely and then also i um i picked up boneworks as well which is supposed to be

22:48.360 --> 22:53.240
another really immersive vr game so i'm going to be uh looking forward to play that as well

22:53.800 --> 22:59.000
um and then even had fun with beat saber i like turning it up because you know i'm not too like

22:59.000 --> 23:03.880
accurate with the um following the arrows so i like putting on the mode where there are no

23:03.880 --> 23:08.120
arrows it just hit it in any direction whatsoever and then you just put it like you know expert

23:09.080 --> 23:14.680
and just go crazy and it's that's a lot of fun so be sure to pick up autica too because that's a

23:14.680 --> 23:19.640
really good music game as well all right i'll check that yep it's harmonix's uh game and it's

23:19.640 --> 23:24.360
kind of like uh imagine if elite beat agents was a vr game it's easy simple simplest way i could put

23:24.360 --> 23:30.840
it so all right cool all right well uh let's talk about my gaming week okay so last week i mentioned

23:30.840 --> 23:35.720
i was going to check this game out and dark soccer this game is up your alley you really

23:35.720 --> 23:42.200
have to check this game out okay this game this game is called demon's tilt with the uh headline

23:42.200 --> 23:48.760
or with the subheading occult pinball action and it's basically yeah it's a it's it's basically

23:48.760 --> 23:53.960
somebody took like their love of devil's crush and alien crush and like made a new crush table that's

23:53.960 --> 23:59.320
basically what this is they made satan crush and that's what this game is basically uh it's okay

23:59.320 --> 24:05.400
i'm getting it like right now it's like if heavy metal the movie was a pinball table which maybe

24:05.400 --> 24:11.960
it was i don't know but it was i like there is so much going on in the game i couldn't tell you what

24:11.960 --> 24:16.440
the fuck is happening but it's really pretty and it's one of the it's it's one of those pinball

24:16.440 --> 24:20.200
games just like alien crush or devil crush where there's like you start on the middle table and

24:20.200 --> 24:24.040
you can fall to the lower table or you go all the way up to the upper table like it's one of those

24:24.040 --> 24:28.200
things there's the multi-levels like what was that like rollerball on the nes or something was like

24:28.200 --> 24:32.040
the first game i remember doing something like that but it has those whole like different levels

24:32.040 --> 24:38.280
um so i played it on xbox game pass but i believe it is on windows and mac if i'm not mistaken and

24:38.280 --> 24:42.920
uh nintendo switch so dark sakura has no shortage yeah it's on steam but i think i'll probably get

24:42.920 --> 24:47.800
it on switch that's pretty cool yeah so uh i i feel like this game's up your alley so i would

24:47.800 --> 24:51.320
feel horrible if i didn't recommend it to you so i spent a good time some good time playing this game

24:51.320 --> 24:55.000
and just watching all the pretty stuff and trying to get achievements and yeah it was pretty cool

24:55.000 --> 24:59.560
so uh i look forward to your review next week dark sakura uh because you're the pinball queen

24:59.560 --> 25:03.080
uh but i enjoyed it i enjoyed it and that was definitely my review will be i played animal

25:03.080 --> 25:09.960
crossing was at some point you're gonna need a break from animal crossing at some point

25:09.960 --> 25:15.240
anyway uh so i played that and uh i've been playing the usual stuff too i found sc14 orna

25:15.240 --> 25:20.680
diablo uh but i played some other new well okay i play one other new game i play one old game too

25:20.680 --> 25:25.080
so because you know i'm stuck at home i've definitely been making use out of my xbox game

25:25.080 --> 25:31.400
pass i also played here's a jamie game sort of king of fighters 98 how random is that is on game

25:31.400 --> 25:37.560
pass hell yeah so i was like i'm gonna play this why not oh i can put together my dream team of

25:37.560 --> 25:43.000
kim kapwan and my and uh andy bogart all in the team and uh yeah there's uh you know it's it's

25:43.000 --> 25:47.720
ba it's the neo geo game but it's when they did it for the xbox 360 because it's uh that

25:47.800 --> 25:52.280
compatibility version but i thought it was like random and cool that that was on xbox game pass

25:52.280 --> 25:57.960
so uh there was that but then the other game that i spent a bit of time playing uh was one of those

25:57.960 --> 26:03.080
games where people have been telling me for like years you need to play this game and i don't know

26:03.080 --> 26:07.160
why i resisted i guess maybe like watching the early trailers and stuff i was like i don't really

26:07.160 --> 26:12.680
know if that's for me or i didn't like i had the first game on 360 and i don't really remember

26:12.680 --> 26:18.200
playing a lot of it and now that i've played a good like 90 minutes or so of it i i fear i

26:18.200 --> 26:23.400
may have made the same mistake that i made with the mass effect series the first time i played it

26:23.400 --> 26:27.240
because and if you don't know what i'm talking about the first time i played mass effect

26:27.240 --> 26:31.640
i thought i was like i don't get it but then i went back years later and played it and i was like

26:31.640 --> 26:39.320
i am obsessed.com and i played the entire trilogy so what game was it that i finally played this

26:39.320 --> 26:49.800
week near automata oh my god it's so fun it's like i i'm like oh it's so good like uh i played

26:49.800 --> 26:55.080
through like that whole like intro level the only like frustrating thing was that you can't save in

26:55.080 --> 26:59.160
that whole opening like you go through like an hour long opening and you can't freaking save

26:59.160 --> 27:03.560
at all that was the only annoying thing but otherwise i i kind of didn't realize it's like

27:03.560 --> 27:07.640
okay it's like an actiony kind of game like you're playing something like i don't know like maybe

27:07.640 --> 27:14.600
like bayonetta i mean another platinum game i guess um but you're kind of playing a shooter game

27:14.600 --> 27:20.360
at the same time it depends what difficulty level you're playing on if you play on bobby blackwolf

27:20.360 --> 27:25.560
mode or easy mode then the shooter stuff i think is i i'm playing on normal but i believe i read

27:25.560 --> 27:29.640
that on the easy mode the shooter stuff is kind of all done for you so you can just focus on button

27:29.640 --> 27:33.640
mashing the um melee combat stuff but i'm playing on normal mode where you kind of have to do both

27:33.640 --> 27:39.960
at once and it's it's really confusing at first but it's like really really fun so um yeah it's

27:39.960 --> 27:43.880
and they just put it on game pass this past week so that's why i finally jumped in i was like oh

27:43.880 --> 27:49.080
i should just play this already um hey rob yeah what if i can interject real quick demons till

27:49.080 --> 27:55.240
just 13.99 on switch right now oh that's not bad that's not bad i mean i pay for xbox game pass

27:55.240 --> 27:59.640
so it's free but not really free because i'm paying for xbox game pass so it's you know that

27:59.640 --> 28:05.000
whole thing but if you have 20 on steam oh oh so it's a little cheaper on switch well that's good

28:05.000 --> 28:11.080
cool um so yeah near i i definitely want to go back and play more so i can get further into the

28:11.080 --> 28:15.000
game and tell you if there's like even more about it that i like um because now i feel like i kind

28:15.000 --> 28:18.840
of hit like i feel like i played through all the prologue stuff and i was doing some of the stuff

28:18.840 --> 28:23.080
around the ship and then i kind of like ran out of time um but i want to go back and do more and

28:23.080 --> 28:29.400
see if like the later levels are as fun as that first one was um and i think finally like because

28:29.400 --> 28:34.440
they have that raid in final fantasy 14 uh it has a really you know it's a really cool ambience and

28:34.440 --> 28:40.040
the music in final fantasy 14 is incredible and like i didn't really realize they kind of lifted

28:40.040 --> 28:45.720
stuff directly from the game i mean it's a little different but like the game's soundtrack is fucking

28:45.720 --> 28:53.480
great like it's oh it's good so yeah uh my bad you all told me for a long time i needed to play it

28:53.480 --> 28:59.560
finally got around to it you all were right what can i say finally played it so uh and i will be

28:59.560 --> 29:03.640
playing more of it later on so it's near automata finally all these years later so playing the xbox

29:03.640 --> 29:08.200
version which i guess is the i don't know if it's the definitive edition but it's like the most

29:08.200 --> 29:14.200
recent one they put out so it has like all the extra stuff in it i think so playing that one uh

29:14.200 --> 29:18.520
all right so there it is that's my gaming week so um don't really have a lot else to say here at the

29:18.520 --> 29:22.760
top of the show i think we ought to just jump right into some gaming news so loki what's going

29:22.760 --> 29:29.400
on in the gaming world this week all right so let's talk about rumors and speculation of course

29:29.400 --> 29:39.320
um so there is the whole anniversary of mario coming up here pretty soon the 35 year anniversary

29:39.880 --> 29:46.360
and the rumor is that nintendo is playing on remastering some of the 3d mario games to put

29:46.360 --> 29:53.000
into a collection kind of like a new um mario all-stars type game so the thought is that there's

29:53.000 --> 30:01.000
going to be remasters of the mario 64 the galaxy games uh sunshine that type of stuff as long as

30:01.000 --> 30:07.480
um as well as there's going to be some information about super nintendo world and of course the

30:07.480 --> 30:16.200
upcoming animated super mario movie that's being worked on um as well so apparently the thought

30:16.200 --> 30:21.400
that the reveal is supposed to happen around e3 um but now it's gonna be rolled into maybe a

30:21.400 --> 30:27.720
different trade show or maybe part of this digital event they're gonna do and usually you know i'm

30:27.720 --> 30:32.600
i'm iffy on bringing up rumors here on the program it's obviously not the first time we've done it

30:32.600 --> 30:36.920
but this is one of those rumors that's kind of coming from multiple places right like it's it's

30:36.920 --> 30:42.040
not just like my uncle who works at nintendo told me this is happening like this is coming from

30:42.040 --> 30:48.680
places that are right in historically and it's like several outlets are kind of cross-verifying

30:48.680 --> 30:55.320
this information so it's it's a high pro on the plausibility scale it's pretty high right

30:56.520 --> 31:00.840
um i think it's pretty reasonable that they would do something like this it seems like easy enough

31:00.840 --> 31:06.360
to remaster some of these older games especially since they've kind of have remastered like some

31:06.360 --> 31:15.080
of the galaxy games and stuff because they were running them on um the nvidia shield in china oh

31:15.080 --> 31:20.200
that's right no you're right they did make those games on on the shield so so technically i mean

31:20.200 --> 31:25.480
that's pretty i mean it's shield hardware is pretty similar to the nintendo switch already

31:25.480 --> 31:32.120
so the work's been kind of already done um so i mean it's pretty plausible it's gonna happen in

31:32.120 --> 31:36.920
more announcements regarding super nintendo world i mean that makes sense since they're already

31:36.920 --> 31:41.960
working on it and we already know that the mario movie is coming it would be cool if we had a

31:41.960 --> 31:47.160
trailer or something uh but i don't think i don't remember when that slated to come out that might

31:47.160 --> 31:53.080
be 2021 or 2022 uh but yeah it'd be interesting to hear something about it i believe the mario

31:53.080 --> 31:57.160
movie was supposed to be like holiday 2021 or something like that so you know maybe a trailer

31:57.160 --> 32:01.240
or first look would make a lot of sense so we kind of get the idea like what does it look like is it

32:01.240 --> 32:05.320
like a cartoon or is it like a and it's probably not it's probably gonna look like despicable me

32:05.320 --> 32:11.000
that type of animation yeah oh i don't think i mean well not like you know what i mean like that

32:11.000 --> 32:16.040
style of like pixar-ish type of art yeah it's not like the whole thing is gonna look like despicable

32:16.040 --> 32:21.960
me but you know it's that same studio so it's that type of art yeah yeah um illumination is

32:21.960 --> 32:28.920
like great stuff so i wouldn't be any surprise if it's gonna be great well and the mario uh world

32:28.920 --> 32:35.320
was supposed to open in japan in time for the tokyo olympics and i don't know if they had

32:35.320 --> 32:39.320
ended up ultimately pushing the opening back a little bit or if it was going to make it but we

32:39.320 --> 32:44.200
saw some of those construction pictures out there it would have made a lot of sense that like early

32:44.200 --> 32:51.400
june would have been a great time frame to get a first look at the mario park if it was going to

32:51.400 --> 32:57.240
open soon for the tokyo olympics obviously the global pandemic has fucked up all of these

32:57.240 --> 33:04.840
timelines so nothing is certain anymore but i mean it's it would seem like early june would

33:04.840 --> 33:09.560
have been about the right time to hear more about the park and probably those sorts of things were

33:09.560 --> 33:15.000
already in motion as far as getting the footage concept putting that stuff together before the

33:15.000 --> 33:20.520
pandemic really hit so we could still still see some of that come out in june it just might be

33:20.520 --> 33:24.040
the timetable of when this actually opens could really be up in the air

33:25.880 --> 33:31.480
i suppose yeah i mean it'd be interesting to see uh i would like some more details of what's going

33:31.480 --> 33:36.920
to be at the park because i'm very excited to go see that yeah i remember seeing some of the the

33:36.920 --> 33:42.360
video shots that they had showing like those moving platforms and stuff um i mean it's looking

33:42.360 --> 33:46.840
very much like their concept that they had in there so i'm very curious to see what kind of

33:46.840 --> 33:50.920
rides and everything because i mean honestly once that stuff opens up especially over here in the

33:50.920 --> 33:57.320
united states i'm down to go to go vacation there so we'll have to see uh sg100 matt with an

33:57.320 --> 34:01.720
excellent point in chat saying theme parks are in big trouble so it's really up in the air yeah i

34:01.720 --> 34:05.880
mean we don't know what it's going to look like on the other side of this you know we don't know

34:05.880 --> 34:10.280
if theme parks are going to be able to reopen right away and i suppose just a lot of that

34:10.280 --> 34:15.880
really depends on the science behind this thing you know can they test to see if people have it

34:15.880 --> 34:21.640
really fast you know can they do more things to slow the spread down and so forth i mean a lot of

34:21.640 --> 34:27.800
these factors are going to dictate if theme parks can open up really fast or not um because i i mean

34:27.800 --> 34:34.120
again i am not a scientist or a doctor but i could see a situation where like small businesses open

34:34.120 --> 34:40.760
up again and you can still kind of have small gatherings but they frown on the big stuff for a

34:40.760 --> 34:47.880
few more months i mean again i have you that's just me you know being a fortune teller i have

34:47.880 --> 34:52.600
no idea to listen to the people that are doctors and scientists and what they have to say but i

34:52.600 --> 34:55.880
could just kind of see that that's like a logical progression that this sorts of thing is like

34:55.880 --> 35:00.760
easier to track in smaller groups than it would be you know thousands of people at a theme park

35:00.760 --> 35:08.360
type of thing so i don't know anyway um yeah and phoenix uh in chat is asking is it going to end

35:08.360 --> 35:13.480
up being seasonal is another important question that's a hugely important question and you know

35:13.480 --> 35:19.320
can we develop uh you know again the the rapid testing can we develop an immunity can we develop

35:19.320 --> 35:24.120
a vaccine like we can do for the flu you know so much is dependent although all those things we

35:24.120 --> 35:29.160
don't have an answer for yet but we know the world is working on it um and from a technical angle

35:29.160 --> 35:33.880
you know that folding at home that we talked about a few weeks ago has never seen the type of action

35:33.880 --> 35:38.840
that has been seen because everybody wants to help do something about all the bitcoin miners

35:38.840 --> 35:45.080
are taking their resources and moving them more appropriately to be working on um this instead

35:45.080 --> 35:49.160
maybe that's why cooking mama on the switch is it's actually where you know i'm just okay that's

35:49.160 --> 35:52.040
that's a whole other thing i wasn't going to bring up because we don't know what the hell's going on

35:52.040 --> 35:55.960
cooking mom on the switch but i'm sure you've seen some of the rumors going on out there so yeah

35:55.960 --> 36:01.320
anyway but anyway uh so we just don't know there's still a lot of things that are going to find out

36:01.320 --> 36:05.960
in the weeks and weeks and weeks ahead so uh we will see uh anyway going back to the

36:05.960 --> 36:10.360
mario story for a minute uh what about these mario games that they're saying could be part

36:10.360 --> 36:16.920
of the uh remaster i i think the mario sunshine and mario galaxy games really do seem like good

36:16.920 --> 36:21.880
candidates to come back because especially mario sunshine i think was really under appreciated the

36:21.880 --> 36:25.080
first time when it was out on the gamecube but i feel like it was one of those things like

36:25.880 --> 36:30.600
a lot of people that played it still really loved it for its unique kind of water mechanic

36:30.600 --> 36:34.760
and then you know bringing back mario 64 is kind of just like that sure thing you know especially

36:34.760 --> 36:39.160
if they if they kind of up res it and make it look even better if they're gonna like truly remaster

36:39.160 --> 36:43.560
it uh i think that has the potential to do very well because you know that's a lot of people's

36:43.560 --> 36:47.400
all-time favorite mario game what do you think about specifically the games that they're choosing

36:47.400 --> 36:54.920
loki or dark soccer well i don't think they've really announced yet what games they're gonna

36:54.920 --> 37:00.600
choose i mean it's all kind of speculated right now um i don't know i it's been a while since i

37:00.600 --> 37:04.440
played galaxy i would love to go back to play those because they were apparently really great

37:04.440 --> 37:09.560
games which i had not you know wish i'd actually finished them i hear also that the rumor is

37:09.560 --> 37:14.360
supposed to be that they're going to be announcing a new paper mario game and honestly i mean i

37:14.360 --> 37:19.000
haven't been able to get into a lot of paper mario games but super paper mario that was on the wii

37:19.000 --> 37:24.600
was fantastic and i love that yeah the wii one was really good how about how about super mario

37:24.600 --> 37:29.480
rpg how about that although essentially i think that's kind of what paper mario is

37:30.360 --> 37:33.880
it's kind of like well we can't make mario rpg anymore because that's the square enix thing but

37:33.880 --> 37:37.480
hey anything is possible in this crazy world you never know i'm gonna cross my fingers i'm

37:37.480 --> 37:43.720
personally looking for famicom grand prix f1 race i mean just saying it was only out on the

37:43.720 --> 37:49.640
disk system and you know hey mario racing another car it isn't you know mario kart you never know

37:49.640 --> 37:55.000
dreams really do come true sometimes you never know i'm rooting for mario is missing hell yeah

37:55.000 --> 38:01.000
let's bring entertainment back all right anyway uh let's move on and talk about um you know this

38:01.000 --> 38:06.280
this news is one of those like it's not surprising although it still kind of sucks but you kind of

38:06.280 --> 38:12.680
saw it coming and that is that the last of us part two has been delayed again with no new release

38:12.680 --> 38:17.720
date set we don't know when it's coming out it's like gaga's album it's been put on hold until

38:17.720 --> 38:23.240
she's ready until we know when this whole thing is going to be behind us and so on so i'm sure

38:23.240 --> 38:28.840
that news does disappoint people but i are y'all really surprised so yeah the game was going to be

38:28.840 --> 38:34.840
coming out on may 29th but uh they did confirm via a tweet um sie has made the difficult decision to

38:34.840 --> 38:41.000
delay the launch of the last of us part two and actually marvel's iron man vr until further notice

38:41.000 --> 38:45.720
logistically the global crisis is preventing us from providing the launch experience our players

38:45.720 --> 38:51.080
deserve currently there are no other delays to report but we'll keep you updated and i'm sure

38:51.080 --> 38:55.880
a lot of people are wondering well why don't they just do a digital release and da da da da

38:55.880 --> 39:02.680
and i think the reality is those day one sales are so important that i think they want to make

39:02.680 --> 39:09.080
sure they're engaging not just digital but they are engaging the people that want to get retail

39:09.080 --> 39:15.640
or physical or the people whose habits are more i want to go to target i want to go to game stop

39:15.640 --> 39:21.560
i want to go to wherever it is that i get games um to to buy this game in a physical condition

39:21.560 --> 39:25.400
because maybe i live in a part of the country where the internet isn't as strong so i can't

39:25.400 --> 39:30.600
exactly download a 70 gigabyte game or whatever this thing chalks in as and so those day one and

39:30.600 --> 39:36.200
those launch number figures are so important where it's like whereas sony could do an all digital

39:36.200 --> 39:41.560
launch is it in their best business sense to really do that and i think the reality is no

39:41.560 --> 39:47.240
it's not and that's why they're putting it on hold until they can really do a strong worldwide launch

39:47.240 --> 39:52.040
i mean kind of look what's happening at the final fantasy 7 remake fantasy 7 remake kind of came in

39:52.040 --> 39:56.360
like it went gold at a really weird time where it was like okay they've hit the ground running on

39:56.360 --> 40:00.680
getting the distribution going and then the pandemic happens because you know these things

40:00.680 --> 40:05.960
don't just ship from the factory the night before this is a a couple months long process to get from

40:05.960 --> 40:11.160
the gold master of the game to what you see out there and now the final fantasy 7 remake thing is

40:11.160 --> 40:17.480
kind of messy i suppose although certainly not square i feel weird saying messy because it's

40:17.480 --> 40:22.760
certainly not square enix's fault or sony's fault or anybody's fault it's just well some copies got

40:22.760 --> 40:26.760
there early and they don't give a shit anymore because of what's going on some copies are going

40:26.760 --> 40:32.040
to be there late and i got my email from amazon saying mine is coming late and although i'm a

40:32.040 --> 40:35.800
little bit like ah bummer i'm like you know what though i completely understand getting

40:35.800 --> 40:40.600
things out like gloves masks groceries and things that people actually need right now

40:40.600 --> 40:44.680
is more important than final fantasy 7 remake and if it i'm really that bent up about it

40:44.680 --> 40:48.680
then i guess i could do digital so i'm not like you know that bent out of shape about it but

40:49.240 --> 40:53.320
the final fantasy 7 if you were bent out of shape about it you need to evaluate your priorities

40:53.320 --> 40:57.720
exactly exactly so i'm like you know whatever you know if i have to wait a couple more days

40:57.720 --> 41:02.840
whatever uh it's i'll probably still be on house arrest through the month of april anyway so i'll

41:02.840 --> 41:07.400
get a chance to play it uh plenty well in fact actually yes we all know we're going to be here

41:07.400 --> 41:11.720
till at least may 3rd for uh it was was that the governor's thing was may 3rd or was that just the

41:11.720 --> 41:16.360
bay area and where the bay area goes sacramento quickly follows regardless as a matter we know

41:16.360 --> 41:21.560
we're going to be here till may so um you know if it's a couple days late whatever i'll still

41:21.560 --> 41:27.880
have plenty of time to play it um i just don't think that sony wants to launch these games

41:27.880 --> 41:33.400
and have it be as all over the place they want this to still be a gaming event and maybe

41:33.400 --> 41:40.840
something when people aren't focusing on all these other more important things and can go back to oh

41:40.840 --> 41:46.360
i'm just doing a game it's a fun silly thing and maybe it also may just be viewed in poor taste

41:46.360 --> 41:50.440
right now to be doing a zombie related game i don't know i mean that that could certainly be

41:50.440 --> 41:55.000
weighing to it as well i don't i don't think that's a big deal but it could be for some people i don't

41:55.000 --> 42:01.720
know so um phoenix in chat says i'm curious about whether the delay is covid related or quality

42:01.720 --> 42:08.440
related either way a good idea i really do think it's covid related as as its core and probably

42:08.440 --> 42:14.200
because the quality can't really be finished like i don't know about you guys but like i'm working

42:14.200 --> 42:19.000
from home right now and i and i'm very fortunate to be able to do that i'm very very fortunate and

42:19.000 --> 42:24.600
very thankful that my position is something that can do that but it is a slower process

42:24.600 --> 42:29.320
and that's nothing to do with you know i i still am a good little worker bee but it's that you know

42:29.320 --> 42:35.080
sometimes the connection to the server is slower uh things working on a laptop is just not as fancy

42:35.080 --> 42:39.240
as when i'm working on my dual monitor setup back at the office there's just things about it that

42:39.240 --> 42:43.480
are inherently slower and the reason why i say that is that you've got all these sony employees

42:43.480 --> 42:48.520
and so forth that are also working from home right now and so probably the quality process

42:48.520 --> 42:53.640
is moving slower you know just and even just a little bit can kind of back up the whole system

42:53.640 --> 43:01.000
if you know what i mean so there is that to be uh uh put in perspective um and phoenix and chat

43:01.000 --> 43:05.160
also says rob what do you think about them charging full price for a quarter of a game

43:05.160 --> 43:09.240
um it's not going to be a quarter of a game for i'm assuming that's about fall 97 remake

43:09.240 --> 43:13.000
it's not a quarter of a game from what i understand and apparently a new trailer released

43:13.000 --> 43:18.760
this week really shows that they are doing some things that should not have been part of the mid

43:18.760 --> 43:26.600
gar story so they're clearly and i i've read one thing i hear there's other spoilers i'm trying to

43:26.600 --> 43:31.160
keep myself pure on it i will probably get spoiled because people are dicks on twitter

43:31.160 --> 43:37.720
but i'm gonna try to go in it as pure as i can um and i know i was super surprised by seeing that

43:39.880 --> 43:46.280
i'm glad you uh cut out there all right so anyway yeah um so i i don't think it's really going to be

43:46.360 --> 43:51.400
a quarter of the game like it's not and even if you play the demo again i i kind of use that as

43:51.400 --> 43:57.720
my there's things in that demo that weren't in the original game so they're they're whatever

43:57.720 --> 44:02.920
what i was trying to say as really surprised in that latest trailer that you know erith decided

44:02.920 --> 44:10.280
to put on the impenetrable vest that's you know no blade can pierce through so i'm really really

44:10.280 --> 44:15.880
curious to see how this is going to change this yes somebody gifted her a bulletproof vest for

44:15.880 --> 44:19.240
no particular reason and we'll see how that changes thing i'm a time traveler for the future

44:19.240 --> 44:26.040
here take this anyway and don't go to 2020 all right anyway uh so there those games have been

44:26.040 --> 44:31.640
delayed so we will hear when they get rescheduled when sony is ready to unveil it i would anticipate

44:31.640 --> 44:37.560
don't expect to hear a new date until people are back at work when people are back at work across

44:37.560 --> 44:43.640
the country then you'll hear a new date but not before so moving on dark sakura

44:46.120 --> 44:52.760
i forgot where i had myself muted so um you know we had talked about amazon's whole gaming deal

44:52.760 --> 44:57.640
before and it looks like they've actually released some information about some titles that are going

44:57.640 --> 45:04.440
to be coming out their first original big budget stuff coming out in may one of them is a sci-fi

45:04.440 --> 45:10.520
third-person shooter called crucible um been in development for a while i mean the description

45:10.520 --> 45:18.600
is pretty you know out there you know very vague um you it's survival and control fighting with

45:18.600 --> 45:25.800
fellow competitors it doesn't really so it looks like it's a team versus game so you know kind of

45:25.800 --> 45:32.840
maybe overwatch-ish from what it sounds like um or like you know fortnite something like that

45:33.320 --> 45:39.320
and it's supposed to be uh released in uh in may and then another one in may is an mmo called new

45:39.320 --> 45:47.240
world that has been described as a tolkanesque reimagining of 17th century british america

45:47.800 --> 45:56.360
um so basically it's you know colonialism and fantasy i guess kind of weird um i don't know

45:56.360 --> 46:02.760
that i'm too happy about that as a theme because i mean well we all know how great colonialism

46:02.760 --> 46:10.360
worked for native populations so just saying kind of not very well of them to do that as a theme

46:10.360 --> 46:13.880
let's see what they let's see where it goes like you know we don't we don't know what the story

46:13.880 --> 46:19.240
really looks like yet it better be void of other humans for me to enjoy it yeah well if they're

46:19.240 --> 46:23.960
going to bring in like magic and fire and things like that then clearly it's not set in a realistic

46:23.960 --> 46:29.560
world anyway so which is probably for the best um well i mean as long as it i don't know i'm

46:29.560 --> 46:34.680
uncomfortable with the with the concept of a game that requires overtaking you know an indigenous

46:34.680 --> 46:43.400
population but that's me um anyway yeah there there's us oh another uh cloud-based uh gaming

46:43.400 --> 46:51.160
service that amazon is developing called project tempo and working um on titles that twitch

46:51.160 --> 46:58.200
broadcasters can play with viewers in real time so uh we'll see what that is i guess it's supposed

46:58.200 --> 47:04.040
to compete with stadia oh that could be interesting i mean the cloud cloud yeah

47:05.640 --> 47:13.000
so who knows all right well we'll we'll see i guess uh amazon will still uh bring uh pull back

47:13.000 --> 47:18.120
the curtain on this a little bit uh in the next month uh in may they can stop being shitty with

47:18.120 --> 47:25.080
the rest of their practices all right let's move on to uh a game i think we've all confessed that

47:25.080 --> 47:33.560
we've been playing recently right logi um correct so pokemon go is making some changes to uh their

47:33.560 --> 47:42.840
game to you know kind of address the having to stay at home and quarantined situations so of

47:42.840 --> 47:48.280
course you know they've done this in other games like uh minecraft earth had a thing where you can

47:48.280 --> 47:53.160
actually bring some of those adventures to yourself now they're going to be doing something similar

47:53.160 --> 48:00.120
where you can take on raid battles um from the comfort of your own home with friends so that's

48:00.120 --> 48:06.280
pretty cool they'll be able to raid it from home um no word exactly when that's supposed to go into

48:06.280 --> 48:14.120
effect 100 but i'd imagine pretty soon so yeah that's got to be a huge change they're making to

48:14.120 --> 48:19.000
the back end of it so that's uh it's kind of surprising they're going to go that far with it

48:19.000 --> 48:24.760
so it's uh interesting for sure and you know um uh there are other games i i have not played

48:24.760 --> 48:29.080
harry potter in quite some time so i couldn't tell you what's going on in that game um but i

48:29.080 --> 48:32.600
have still been playing ingress a little bit and it's been interesting to see kind of the changes

48:32.600 --> 48:37.880
they've been making there where um they really emphasize recharging which is something you can

48:37.880 --> 48:43.640
do from your couch they bumped it up so you get like six times the ap or experience if you will

48:43.640 --> 48:48.680
from like recharging that you used to get um so that's kind of interesting and then you're uh

48:49.000 --> 48:54.200
streak badge for like there's like a badge for oh you hacked uh portals 60 days in a row or

48:54.200 --> 48:57.960
whatever you can get all that from recharging now so it's interesting how they've kind of made that

48:57.960 --> 49:03.960
the emphasis um lately but i've still been going out to ingress like once in a great while like

49:03.960 --> 49:10.200
last saturday i went to a cemetery because there's a ton of portals there and it's a really easy place

49:10.200 --> 49:14.920
to be socially distant from other people uh and just kind of you know messed around in ingress and

49:15.720 --> 49:20.040
it's it was a nice little like take my mind off everything else for a little while type of thing

49:20.040 --> 49:26.200
so oh yeah and as that brings up they brought a new uh uh double boost item as well that's right

49:26.200 --> 49:30.200
i forgot about that they uh that is out as well so you can get some free ones in the shop right now

49:30.840 --> 49:36.120
uh phoenix says are all the parks closed up there rob i know they closed them in oregon

49:36.120 --> 49:42.840
um like city parks and like parks in the neighborhood no but i think like major one i

49:42.920 --> 49:46.920
don't even think they've closed the river parks as far as i know because you know sacramento where

49:46.920 --> 49:51.160
we're based is the river city as far as i know they haven't shut that stuff down yet i think

49:51.160 --> 49:55.320
they've kind of said we're keeping our eye on it and everybody's been pretty well behaved so far so

49:55.320 --> 50:01.080
we're not going to shut it down yet um but i think if you try to go to any state parks and certainly

50:01.080 --> 50:06.440
like if i were to go to the coast uh that's closed down and i know they put out an advisory that said

50:06.440 --> 50:11.800
don't go to south lake tahoe like the people up there were like don't come here stay home you

50:11.800 --> 50:16.520
know so they're those types of more like touristy park things i think they are trying to discourage

50:16.520 --> 50:22.680
people from going to so but um i do know even at the parks around here the play structures

50:22.680 --> 50:26.920
they've put a bunch of caution tape around or they've like roped it off so that kids can't play

50:26.920 --> 50:33.240
on them um because they don't want the surface you know um especially because most kids don't

50:33.240 --> 50:37.640
exhibit systems symptoms yes i know there are certainly some very sad exceptions we've heard

50:37.640 --> 50:42.680
about in the news most kids don't exhibit systems so they don't want them all over the play

50:42.680 --> 50:46.920
structure kind of like spreading it from family to family that way which seems like a smart thing to

50:46.920 --> 50:53.560
do so yeah or as that says in chat cootie factories pretty much so yeah i did see that they did

50:54.200 --> 50:59.400
surround those because and from what i've seen too even just like going to the park just to kind of

50:59.400 --> 51:03.640
walk around or whatever um there's like tons of kids still playing on the parks and stuff

51:04.360 --> 51:08.920
so they they they wrap those all up now with caution tape so that it prevents people from

51:08.920 --> 51:14.280
doing that yep and they did a similar thing in this neighborhood as well so not surprised

51:14.280 --> 51:19.080
yeah well anyhow um just to my next story was kind of about the twitch gaming thing which i

51:19.080 --> 51:22.680
didn't realize was going to be part of what dark soccer had already hit on but there's a little

51:22.680 --> 51:27.080
extra detail in this to talk about those games that are being um developed for twitch because

51:27.080 --> 51:31.480
right now most things as a viewer you're acting a little bit more passively like when somebody's

51:31.480 --> 51:36.040
playing marbles on stream you're not really like in there playing the game with them and then

51:36.040 --> 51:39.800
i also kind of have heard jackbox party pack using that example but i don't know i feel like

51:39.800 --> 51:43.800
a jackbox party pack you kind of are in there playing the game with somebody else i mean maybe

51:43.800 --> 51:48.760
the massively ones like you're just in the audience but i would say i know a lot of people

51:48.760 --> 51:55.080
that are using jackbox party pack like i feel like that game is doing more business and more success

51:55.080 --> 52:00.040
than anything else i know in gaming right now because a lot of like non-gamers are picking it

52:00.040 --> 52:06.440
up and doing like zoom parties like my speaking oregon my cousins live up in oregon and um they

52:06.440 --> 52:10.600
are doing they were doing a jackbox party pack thing on zoom the other night and i never i was

52:10.600 --> 52:13.880
like you guys don't really play video games but that was the thing they were doing to keep in

52:13.880 --> 52:18.920
touch with friends so uh that's uh you know obviously been a huge thing anyhow though um

52:18.920 --> 52:23.080
amazon did mention in an interview with the new york times that they are developing games

52:23.080 --> 52:28.840
that streamers and viewers will play together in real time which is interesting because twitch has

52:28.840 --> 52:33.400
always taken a lot of shit about that lag although if you are which i actually don't

52:33.400 --> 52:38.200
think is a big deal at all but then again we come from an era of shoutcast where there was

52:38.200 --> 52:45.320
always a lag anyway so i'm used to it um but and i believe if you are a um partner you have and i

52:45.320 --> 52:49.960
may be wrong and maybe bleeding some things with mixer but i believe you have access to like a very

52:49.960 --> 52:57.080
fast uh bandwidth type of thing where the lag is lessened but if there's a new excuse me sorry

52:57.080 --> 53:05.960
cough um i believe there's a new um um i lost my train of thought there's a new um technology

53:05.960 --> 53:10.520
there yeah and bobby says in chat the lag is now only like three or four seconds oh affiliates get

53:10.520 --> 53:14.760
low latency mode as well we actually have it turned on with vog oh i didn't even realize i

53:14.760 --> 53:19.400
thought there was still a bit of the delay but even a three or four second delay you can't play

53:19.400 --> 53:24.120
games on you can't live like an action game you play jackbox you can't really play like an action

53:24.120 --> 53:29.640
game so hopefully uh you know with this cloud gaming and some of these other things that we're

53:29.640 --> 53:33.880
hearing about that are you know because google stadia one thing that it does do very impressively

53:33.880 --> 53:38.600
and when i've talked about google stadia i've mentioned it it does respond very well it is like

53:38.600 --> 53:43.400
you're playing a youtube live so if they're kind of able to have some of that same technology when

53:43.400 --> 53:48.120
it comes to playing with other people on twitch that could be very interesting um they are saying

53:48.120 --> 53:52.040
games should be available throughout the summer it's not like this will be the first time that

53:52.040 --> 53:57.080
twitch has had their own games uh twitch sings was a thing although obviously or is a thing

53:57.080 --> 54:01.560
although obviously uh that's a little different because that's not something that viewers

54:01.560 --> 54:06.280
play with the streamer all the time and so forth um so yeah they're saying they're going to keep

54:06.280 --> 54:10.840
viewers engaged and interested enough to keep coming back and supposedly the thing that twitch

54:10.840 --> 54:16.680
wants to have an edge over their competition mixer and youtube and so forth so we'll see where that

54:16.680 --> 54:22.280
goes uh very interested to see what kind of games and so forth they come up with on that all right

54:22.280 --> 54:31.480
let's move on dark sakura so um i i i'm going to go ahead and preface this story saying that it's

54:31.480 --> 54:37.240
focusing a little bit too much on violent games when they're talking about addiction so i'm just

54:37.240 --> 54:43.000
going to dive right into it um so there is a study published called computers in human behavior

54:43.000 --> 54:49.720
that suggesting that playing violent video games in particular can impair anger detection and it

54:49.720 --> 54:55.880
also will enhance a feeling of fighting abilities to make you overconfident in your response to how

54:55.880 --> 55:02.360
you would uh think you could perform in a fight basically um and they're they're talking about

55:03.000 --> 55:09.800
this bias that violent video games increases aggression and ultra social information processing

55:09.800 --> 55:15.240
so they're going from that very flawed standpoint um but they're going a little bit more also into

55:15.240 --> 55:19.480
pathological gaming but they're saying specifically that violent video games are leading to

55:19.480 --> 55:25.320
pathological gaming which again is pretty flawed in general it's by uh thomas f denson who's a

55:25.320 --> 55:31.320
psychology professor at the university of new south wales um where we've seen in other ways

55:31.320 --> 55:35.320
that pathological gaming is like with any addiction it can be any kind of video game

55:35.880 --> 55:42.200
um you know and it's it's defined as pathological gaming this is a quote occurs when people

55:42.200 --> 55:46.920
prioritize playing violent video games he's saying violent i think it's others over facets other

55:46.920 --> 55:51.720
facets of life even when doing so causes impairments relationships academic pursuits worker

55:51.720 --> 55:59.560
mental health um but they did show a correlation and it's he did specify this as it's not perfectly

55:59.560 --> 56:06.520
replicated but the general pattern shows that the violent video games in particular

56:06.520 --> 56:13.800
um impair anger recognition and increase the self-perceived fighting ability and it also

56:13.800 --> 56:20.280
is supposed he said it also lowers the perception of as and this is a quote again other men's

56:20.280 --> 56:27.240
toughness um it was uh three experiments done with 868 participants are randomly assigned to

56:27.240 --> 56:31.560
play either violent or non-violent games and then completing various assessments of social

56:31.560 --> 56:37.640
cognition and threat perception so the first two they played the game for 15 minutes um on an xbox

56:37.640 --> 56:42.760
360 connect i don't know what connect has to do with it because that's not really supported um

56:42.760 --> 56:50.280
the third experiment um played internet browser games for five minutes and so with the non-violent

56:50.280 --> 56:57.560
versus the violent the um the violent ones tended to be worse at recognizing an angry facial

56:57.560 --> 57:04.680
expression and uh were less willing to back out of a hypothetical physical confrontation

57:05.240 --> 57:11.880
um and i thought that they'd be able to take take whoever it was in a fight um i again the the the

57:11.880 --> 57:17.080
experiment to me just sounds very flawed i went you know i wonder if they did the same thing

57:17.720 --> 57:21.400
um you know with say watching a movie or something like that you know

57:22.040 --> 57:27.560
again i think that this one went into the the research with a bias um and i'll go ahead and

57:27.560 --> 57:32.680
just read this last quote from uh from the the paper this research extends to some other work

57:32.680 --> 57:37.880
that we've done on why violent video games are so alluring in that study we found that people who

57:37.880 --> 57:42.920
played a lot of violent video games also rated themselves as more of a good catch to members of

57:42.920 --> 57:48.760
the opposite sex this is also running the gender binary which pisses me off and they also reported

57:48.760 --> 57:55.240
a greater interest in sex um and it also says although those data record uh were correlational

57:55.240 --> 57:59.960
they are consistent with our new findings that playing via video games may give people a boost in

57:59.960 --> 58:05.960
confidence in both their mating and fighting abilities again flawed yeah well and it's the

58:05.960 --> 58:11.240
fact that they used xbox 360 connect for one i can't think of what violent game unless it must

58:11.240 --> 58:16.200
be one of those launch titles like the i i don't know there's got to be like some some stuff i'm

58:16.200 --> 58:19.960
not thinking of in the moment like early but there wasn't a lot of like violent violent stuff on

58:19.960 --> 58:24.600
xbox 360 connect and plus the huge flaw with that is that you're getting your physic if you're

58:24.600 --> 58:27.400
playing connects you're getting your physicality up you're getting your heart rate up you're

58:27.400 --> 58:31.000
getting your motion going versus an internet browser game where you're sitting there clicking

58:31.000 --> 58:35.800
the mouse like that yeah why why aren't they considering the physical the heightened physical

58:35.800 --> 58:41.400
senses that's i haven't read the whole study so i mean there could be possibly more in the study

58:41.400 --> 58:49.560
but the the fact that this is number one focusing on a a gender binary you know which again is flawed

58:49.560 --> 58:56.440
because that's not how people you know really work um there's also you know so many other factors to

58:56.440 --> 59:01.880
consider like you were saying even just the physicality of using a connect game where what

59:01.880 --> 59:08.120
happens if they're playing like a cutesy fighting game you know or say that they're watching a a

59:08.120 --> 59:13.560
violent film or a scary film or say that they have them play a survival horror game you know

59:14.440 --> 59:19.960
where where's the difference in there you know again flawed if we're gonna have this type of

59:19.960 --> 59:25.400
research going then gamers with psychology degrees need to be on the freaking panel

59:26.120 --> 59:29.880
or the fact that they're just being forced to play connect game might make them pretty angry

59:30.520 --> 59:35.400
no that ain't me angry well no not if i was playing um dan central i'd be happy with that

59:35.400 --> 59:40.600
because i missed that game but that game wasn't violent last i remembered maybe there maybe

59:40.600 --> 59:44.280
there's a secret version i don't know about but yeah it's just someone's just really bad at it

59:44.280 --> 59:49.800
i think i think you kind of hit your this sounds like it was a loaded thing and that's why you know

59:49.800 --> 59:54.600
and again you know in full disclosure we're all saying we haven't really read it the finer details

59:54.600 --> 59:59.640
but in reading this summary i think none of us want to because it just sounds like you you

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:04.520
really kind of misfired on a lot of different components of this like you go back to the

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:09.640
drawing board and start over number one you know get get some gamer experts on the panel get people

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:14.840
that you know no thing or two about games number two uh xbox 360 connect is not even a modern thing

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:21.160
anymore so modernize it up a little bit do some comparing with other forms of art i think you

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:25.160
made a good point when you said cutesy fighting games because you highlighted one it's the classic

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:31.400
game of the week well it wasn't a it was kind of a weird you know what i mean but it wasn't it wasn't

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:35.720
violent really you know all things are said and done you know there's some different controls here

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:41.320
that they're not even looking at that i think really kind of just like no this was ran to get

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:48.760
a certain result i don't know anyway um so bobby says fighter within fighter within is a oh god i do

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:53.000
remember that fighter within is a connect only fighting game that brings us motion fighting

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.760
where you'll be flailing your arms legs and doing other silly moves and hopes not only to beat up

01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:00.520
your opponent but that the game will register what you're trying to accomplish by waving said

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:08.280
lips about so what about um they used a fighting game nobody's played crap now i can't think of the

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:15.640
of the name uh uh eternal champions with an activator well obviously well okay but just

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:21.000
looking at an activator makes me violent i'm just saying all right anyway so i think the study has

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.160
some problems an adventurous game as well too i don't know why they just didn't do that one that's

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:29.320
like a better option i know just play mortal combat 11 for god's sake if you want to test a

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:34.200
violent game use one of the most violent ones of all but you know it's it's more modern and it's

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:40.120
not you get you can sit there with a controller you're not getting your body and your heart rate

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:45.400
up and all that as well like i that that is the most flawed thing like and i'm no scientist or

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:50.760
it but i'm like even an idiot can tell you in one scenario you're also you're not really comparing

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:56.520
just this to this because the heart rate's going up the physicalness is going up it's it all this

01:01:56.520 --> 01:02:01.400
other stuff is is is heightened and so you're not really like it's not you're supposed to have a

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:05.480
control because the control isolates the one thing you're trying to review and that's not

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:11.400
what's happening here at all so anyway just my thoughts on it anyway um let's move on

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:15.080
and talk about oh something else that might make you want to fight i don't know loki

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:29.560
all right well um yes so unfortunately we got news from um gearbox about some gearbox employees

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:36.040
about some um royalty checks that weren't going to be as high as they'd expected so

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:42.360
what i've been typical of gearbox employees is that they aren't paid as high as some of the

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:49.160
industry um employees in that same position but the way they offset it is they're paid i guess

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:56.520
a 60 40 royalty split between the company and the employees themselves so they get 40 percent of

01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:02.200
that um what has happened or at least been revealed is that because of the fact the

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:09.080
development costs on borderline 3 despite the game being incredibly successful were high because you

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:16.440
know the game took long to develop and also the conversion from unreal 3 to unreal 4 it cost 95

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:23.640
million to develop the game and apparently over 100 million to develop the dlc for that and because

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:27.720
of that the resulting checks that they were supposed to receive which these are supposed

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:33.720
to be much higher than they were previously um aren't the case anymore so it seems that

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:41.160
with this happening they're still being underpaid in general across the board now i'm not sure that's

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:46.200
going to increase as time goes on i'm not sure the frequency is of these royalty checks but it

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:51.240
still sucks that they're in that position in the first place especially with um coming out of the

01:03:51.240 --> 01:04:02.040
lawsuit that um they have as well for uh gearbox and everything with randy pitchford it was revealed

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:08.440
that he took a 12 million dollar bonus in 2016 um granted that would have been from the 60 percent

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:13.800
that the company gets not the 40 percent but in fact that he takes 12 million dollar bonus

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:19.960
when they're getting undercut kind of sucks hold up hold up that guy loki that guy point i'm

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:25.560
pointing at the poster in the studio that guy yes yes the guy that signed that poster maybe i'm just

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:28.360
gonna take that i think i'm gonna take this down for a little while i'm just gonna take it down

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:34.360
for a little while all right so anyways yeah so apparently yeah he took his bonus and of course

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:40.600
they're all getting underpaid um and then he had some kind words to tell his uh developers if they

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:45.240
were unhappy with it basically saying that hey if you're not happy with the royalty system you're

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:55.320
welcome to quit so um yeah that's unfortunate but um apparently they've been gearbox has been

01:04:55.320 --> 01:05:00.200
looking to go public at some point so it'd be interesting to see how that plays in the things

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:06.360
but um it's not a good look and especially with a lot of controversy surrounding randy uh pitchford

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:11.240
even before the game came out uh it's just it's not not a good look for them no it's not a good

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:14.680
look when you're taking 12 million dollars and then telling everybody else to go without that's

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:21.080
that's really really not a good look so uh i think we're gonna retire randy from the studio

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:24.200
for a little while i think that would be the i think that would be the best idea uh esta

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:28.440
200 mountain chat says shame on gearbox for this then again they did promise these six figure

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:33.560
royalties in writing when they signed on if so then they have a case well and it's just it's

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:38.520
just tacky when the person at the top is getting the most money and the people on the bottom are

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:44.280
getting no i mean it would be one thing if it was like i'm taking the pay cut too or i am taking

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:49.400
some of this money as as you've seen some like like guy fieri with all the shit this he's taken

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:53.240
over the years hey at least he's kind of like taking some of his own money and trying to like

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:57.000
put that back into the frontline restaurant workers and all that stuff like it would be

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.080
a little bit of a different story if something like that was going on but unfortunately it does

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:07.400
not appear to be so anyhow all right well thank you for sharing with that us with uh thank you

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:12.920
for sharing that with us nonetheless um maybe do you think it would have made more if they hadn't

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:18.200
done that whole exclusive to epic thing like where where's the payola from that going i think

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:23.240
it's fine i mean because if anything that would have probably been less because i think they got

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:31.320
some sort of discounts for using a reel on their own platform um i just think that it you know it's

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:35.320
the cost of making the game but i still think they should take care of their employees as well

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:40.680
uh it just unfortunately they've had a lot of flops lately with you know both aliens,

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:47.080
clone and lorraine's and uh their looters i can't remember the other game that they had

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:53.080
so they had battleborn was their other their hero shooter that didn't really take off um

01:06:54.280 --> 01:07:01.160
i just think yeah it kind of sucks that this is what happened but i'm hoping that maybe

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:08.680
with future success you know with the game that maybe they'll get paid better but i guess you know

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:15.560
you're in that position now where um you know maybe if opportunities arise you know in the

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:20.600
future or maybe they don't stay at the company very long but unfortunately i think a lot of

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:25.960
times in this industry that they don't really have the luxury of being able to choose going

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:30.360
choose to go to other companies because it seems like everybody is treating their employees poorly

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:35.960
in one way or the other well and right now things are kind of stuck you know like now is not the

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:39.160
time i think a lot of people want you know with everything that's going on in the world it's not

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:43.880
a great time i'm not saying you can't or you know so forth and um you know certainly in other

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:46.600
industry i'm talking about specifically about like gaming and tech types of things i think most

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:49.320
people are trying to like stay where they're at type of thing i don't think there's a lot of moving

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:56.040
and shaking going on in that regard so i mean yeah but after that who knows and i think there

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:59.560
are a lot of tech companies people are really happy to work for like i have some friends in

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:04.360
the industry and i i don't want to name it because i don't have permission to even though it's a good

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:07.640
thing it's just a tacky thing to do because i want my friends to be able to trust that i can

01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:12.600
separate personal life from the show um but i have friends that work in gaming that absolutely love

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:18.600
where they're at and love their companies um and you know uh wouldn't think to you know but but i

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:22.840
i'm not hearing these types of stories about those companies either you know what i mean

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:29.720
true that that's awesome yeah definitely true and and i think you know different with even

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:35.320
leading up to the release of warlands 3 it was just always about randy pitchford doing weird

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:41.160
things whether it's leaving a jump drive in a strip club or something like it was like a jump

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:50.040
drive with like pornography on it and company you know personal company information it's just or you

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:56.200
know punching you know his what was it like getting into a fight with one of his colleagues or

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:03.320
just getting into a lawsuit it's just ridiculous all the stuff before the game came out all right

01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:07.800
well let's move on and try to get to um some more hopeful news here before we get to the

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:13.240
classic game or pinball game of the month uh and that is a story about another humble bundle that's

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:17.320
out and i know you know humble bundle kind of became its own store so i think the news

01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:21.400
the notoriety about different like charity bundles and humble bundles i think we haven't heard as much

01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:27.480
of that uh in like uh the at the top of gaming like remember when these guys first started like

01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:33.080
every bundle they did um would be a notable thing and that kind of died off a little bit when humble

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:37.080
kind of started you know becoming their own store in their own company and so forth but this one

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:41.720
is a pretty big one that's getting news headlines again and i think you'll understand why

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:48.200
it's the covet 19 humble bundle and it's it's a really pretty impressive bundle that they put

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:53.080
together there uh they're saying it is a thousand dollars worth of games and comics that they are

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:59.080
putting together for just thirty dollars or more but the 30 is the minimum to get everything

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:03.720
but if you want to contribute more you certainly can and all of the money is going to different

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:10.840
coronavirus outbreak organizations um and again you can kind of um mix and match how what charities

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:16.360
you want to support out of the four uh and so forth which um oh i don't have the names of the

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:20.520
charities right in front of me uh i'm loading that up right now let me mention some of the

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:26.680
games though that are in the bundle into the breach the witness super hot broken age undertale

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:33.320
psycho not psych psychonauts excuse me um and uh yeah so there's there's a lot of you know and

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:38.440
again these are indie titles that were probably big in the last like three four years but still

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:43.400
i mean this is a great collection of things you might have missed and it's pretty hard to say like

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:47.480
oh these games should have been better when it's going for a good cause because it's really about

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:53.000
the cause it's not about um you know all the games that you're getting so the charities are direct

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:59.240
relief international rescue committee doctors without borders and partners in health so um

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:05.000
i just when i donated i just split my money evenly between them all but some people might um you know

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.240
kind of mix and match a little bit um another one that's very interesting uh that's in there

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:14.040
music maker edm edition because that was uh another like utility file that i picked up and

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:17.800
i was interested in that one so and some of them are run it starting to run a little low if you

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:24.840
want zombotron uh they're down to less than 25 000 keys on that so um something to consider there

01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:30.440
anyhow at least it's for a good cause and it's nice to see the gaming world come together

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:36.040
and uh sell their old games again for good causes so yeah i picked it up as well i just want to make

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:41.400
sure i didn't most of the keys i did have quite a few there's a lot of games that i own that i

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:48.360
didn't realize i was like oh yeah it's like you already have this i'm like i do yeah i had a few

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:53.960
of them like a win uh pac-man championship edition 2 is in there i was like oh uh i love i i already

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:57.400
have that game on switch and everything so i'm like oh i'll get that on sale and i was like oh

01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:02.040
i guess i already had this on steam and i forgot but i still i bought it anyway just because i want

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:06.200
to support the cause you know and uh i i think uh there's there's enough stuff in there that'll

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:10.040
keep me busy uh the music maker thing too was kind of new for me so i was like oh i'll check

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:14.680
that out i want to i want to look at that so yeah really fun yeah for sure all right well let's take

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:19.640
a trip back down memory lane we're going to revisit some simpler times uh and dark soccer

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:23.560
likes to step into the gaming vault every week and pick a game that she thinks hey you guys should

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:28.760
check this out but in a yearly an annual twist once a month she does something a little different

01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:34.040
and this time uh in the year 2020 she's highlighting classic pinball tables of i think

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:40.920
the late 80s and early 90s so uh dark and dark sakura what did you pick for the classic pinball

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:47.080
table of the month another one that i own um i picked black rose which is another of my favorite

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:53.480
awesome so black sorry the twitch uh twitch video coming in a moment here sorry guys i made a boo boo

01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:58.600
on my end okay sorry go ahead and talk though we'll get the video up here shortly all right

01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:08.440
well um black rose is a lady pirate themed game um it was designed by john trudeau and uh brian eddie

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:17.160
and it was produced by uh midway as bally and so um its slogan is this game is loaded and so uh

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:28.920
you use uh you know uh basically you're doing a pirate fight um so uh it uh actually had um

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:36.840
for uh the uk release there was supposed to be some x-rated artwork for the back glass

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:42.200
um but it was never produced and they also considered using black pinballs

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:50.840
as cannonballs but they abandoned that idea um so the game uh was manufactured in july of 1992

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:59.080
as i said by uh midway uh as a subsidiary of williams uh under bally um it uh it was using

01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:11.000
the williams wpc electronics 2 um and uh there were 3746 units confirmed sold um and so as far

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:17.480
as its features it has three flippers three pop bumpers three ramps uh three bank stand-up targets

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:24.280
uh two or three multi-ball the left ramp is mechanically raised or lowered with a ramp um

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:30.120
to use the ball cannon lower playfield has below the playfield ball cannon a catapult type that

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:36.120
oscillates when it's load so basically what this is is that you have this one ramp in the center

01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:43.080
and it moves side to side and you have to line it up where uh you want to basically shoot the

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:50.440
cannonball um and so you fire when you press the fire button on this lockdown bar um it has the

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:57.800
the broadside so it will kick the ball to the center of this rail um so we'll set it back to

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:04.520
the flippers that way um the art for the table was done by pat uh pat mcman who has done i mean quite

01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:11.960
a decent bit of uh of various pinball art you know uh he did things like uh trying to think

01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:18.680
of what people are seeing roller games um he did tales of the arabian knights uh he did baby pac-man

01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:27.400
dirty harry dungeon dragons fish tales so he's done some big titles mr and mrs pac-man pinball

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:32.920
i'm gonna have to find that one day um i was just looking at other artwork that he did but now um

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:38.280
one of the things that i'm going to bring into this is a little bit of some crazy notoriety

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:46.280
about one of the designers john trudeau um basically he got busted for child porn

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:55.240
that's a yike yeah now let me tell you what else he designed that rob the machine bride of pinbot

01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:03.320
creature from the black lagoon uh judge dread i actually we actually owned judge dread and

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:09.800
creature from the black lagoon he did congo um and he had started working for stern in uh 19

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:15.560
sorry in 2013 and he had some tables all set up but yeah he was arrested and charged for

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:19.720
a possession of child pornography he might have done some cool stuff but what an asshole

01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:28.680
now here's a little bit more about it is that he actually was um uh that he did plead guilty

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:36.360
to those and they had also gotten him on um abuse of a criminal sexual abuse of a female family member

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:46.840
um so yeah garbage absolute garbage um so you know i want to point out there that um

01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:52.920
the uh you know we can have fun with with our tables we can enjoy our fandom but we need to

01:16:52.920 --> 01:17:00.760
also be aware that you know if you're gonna say oh i love this designer know about the people

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:06.120
your favorites are problematic so yeah he's done some great tables i mean creature is dan's favorite

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:12.600
um but again you know be aware of the people who uh be aware of the entertainment you consume

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:22.280
hello for sure no yes you're still good sorry i'm i'm working on some other projects while

01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:28.200
you're talking i'm multitasking um back though to a little bit more information about black rose

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:36.600
um it was included as a license table for pinball arcade and um goodness i accidentally turned on the

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:45.160
stream when i didn't mean to there we go all right so sorry about that um it also was included in

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:51.800
williams pinball volume two for pinball fx3 um and included in williams pinball classics in 2001

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:58.920
that came out for pc so there you go now i will tell you this is seriously still one of my

01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:06.200
favorite tables ever um it uh it you might you know if you go to like a trade show or something

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:15.000
and you see it out there um it is it's one that people tend to pass up because it seems kind of

01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:22.120
generic blah blah blah whatever you know but it really is super fun that center cannonball ramp

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:26.680
is it probably just makes most of the fun in the game for me and you know you have like these

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:37.720
light up targets that say uh sink ship um so it really is just a lot of fun um and i mean as

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:42.360
people can see from the video up here it's fairly unique little table it's got enough in there i

01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:49.160
think it'll keep bringing people back to playing it so um definitely wanna um make sure that all

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:53.720
of you out there give this table a shot because it's really a lot of fun don't pass it up if you

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:59.480
find one to play all right there it is your classic pinball table of the month black rose

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:06.040
and this is our maties yeah that's a fun table and you and it's in your collection at your house

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:14.200
right it is it is in right in between my world cup soccer and my doctor who all right very cool

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:19.800
all right um so dark soccer i believe my you're working from home again tomorrow so you have to

01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:23.880
leave us a little soon tonight um so do you want to get into your rapid fire stories here real

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:31.640
quick before we uh say goodbye sure um forever entertainment um uh has said that the revenue

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:38.840
from panzer dragoon remake has exceeded the production costs so um by more than double so

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:46.440
yeah they made the money back good for them hooray and um in other news um a first person resident

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:53.720
evil 8 is in the works and should be out by next year at least that seems to be some speculation

01:19:53.720 --> 01:20:01.080
they're thinking it might be switched but again i don't know i don't i they kind of lost me so

01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:06.440
i only care about the early ones yeah i but i don't know if i want to see him remake resident

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:11.400
evil 4 because i heard resident evil 3 like they really kind of they they kind of changed it quite

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:16.680
a bit like they they didn't really stick to it well the big thing on there is with jill's design

01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:22.680
i was reading is that they tried to make her like take out the sex appeal as much because honestly

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:26.840
who's gonna run around fighting zombies in a fucking mini skirt and tube pop yeah it's like

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:32.520
running away from dinosaurs in high heels yeah yeah so um but the thing is that you know and

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:37.240
this is actually the quote is that they didn't want her to be in something that would be

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:42.840
uncomfortable for her task um and i think that's great and it kind of makes me consider that maybe

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:47.640
this will be the next cosplay that i revisit because one of my very early ones uh for my

01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:56.360
first anime expo actually was um jill valentine old school jill all right there you go looking

01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:59.720
forward to seeing it all right well um dark sakura i know you're heading out but do you

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:04.840
have any last words for us before you uh make your way out tonight pray for me 5 a.m shift

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:11.720
hey i'm happy to hear you get to go back that's the most important thing so well the big thing

01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:16.920
is going to be can i actually get back because apparently i can't get into any of my work sites

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:22.760
so we'll see if that happens right all right fingers crossed good luck all right fingers

01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:27.880
and toes bye y'all all right bye thanks for joining us find words to you all right take care

01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:32.360
great to hear from you tonight all right all right um let's move on with some other rapid

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:39.240
fire news uh loki you want to take your your stuff sure okay so i was unaware that they

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:48.680
were still even making um updates to this game but apparently rock smith uh 2014 remastered

01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:55.560
has um ubisoft san francisco has basically said that they're done adding dlc to rock smith so

01:21:55.560 --> 01:22:03.800
right now they have a library of 1570 songs and yeah apparently they're working on a new project

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:11.080
now um it's interesting that's been going on this long i like i said i was completely aware that

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:16.760
they were still supporting that game so yeah i knew they were supporting it a while i didn't

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:21.320
realize it was like still going on even in 2020 i thought the last time i really saw the dlc was

01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:27.480
last year but that's still very impressive and it was remastered so i was not aware of that either

01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:33.560
so yeah neat um yeah so that's unfortunate but i guess we'll have to see what's coming from

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:39.480
ubisoft san francisco and then of course this time of the month since we're being a brand new

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:44.600
month and everybody is at home it's time to figure out what are the brand new free games that you can

01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:50.040
get from your subscription services so we have playstation plus which is going to be gracing us

01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:57.640
with uncharted 4 and dirt rally 2.0 so those are going to be available very soon april 7th through

01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:06.520
may 4th on the xbox side of the house we've got project cars 2 and nights of pen and paper

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:12.920
and then of course on the xbox 360 side we have fable anniversary and toy box turbos

01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:21.240
all right i didn't i i had forgot they even made a fable anniversary edition but i want to probably

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:27.080
check that out i like those games they're fun yep all right uh moving on over to some other news uh

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:32.200
this one's about saints row the third uh i don't know what do you think about this loki apparently

01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:38.200
a remaster could be coming the esrb had a listing for saints row the third remastered uh do out on

01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:43.160
pc playstation 4 and xbox one you might remember originally these games are on pc playstation 3

01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:49.400
and xbox 360 um but it's um i guess there was a nintendo switch port as well but it wasn't

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:54.280
very good uh that just came out last year but potentially these games could be remade and coming

01:23:54.280 --> 01:24:00.040
out again on playstation 4 and xbox one although i would think why not start for playstation 5 and

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:03.480
the other one but maybe i don't know maybe it's not going to be that big of a remaster i don't

01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:10.040
know what do you think um i thought that they i mean i guess i guess it was saints row 4 that

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:15.240
they had remastered um i mean i i guess it wouldn't be that much of a stretch since um

01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:21.640
four wasn't that much of a stretch from three so i mean it's practically the same engine

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:29.400
so i wouldn't see how that would be a hard thing for them to um port in there yeah it's just kind

01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:34.280
of killing time i guess until we get a new announcement for saints row oddly enough though

01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:40.520
because i did end up buying the humble bundle the covet 19 one it did have agents of mayhem in there

01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:46.280
i saw that it was probably never gonna buy that game but now you got it at least for a good time

01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:52.840
yeah all right uh also in a quick rapid fire story our last one tonight uh cellar door games in a

01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:57.560
tweet mentioned that they are working on rogue legacy 2 that's right they're confirming that

01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:02.120
rogue legacy 2 is in development and they'll be releasing more info later this week in the coming

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:07.080
days and there's some screenshots there on their twitter account over at cellar door games and i

01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:14.120
do want to thank all the folks on um our uh twitter uh and i'm sorry on our discord server for sending

01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:20.040
us all these stories over on twitter and those sorts of things uh for inclusion this week yes

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:25.000
a lot of the things you guys posted in our discord over at vog network dot com slash discord uh we've

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:31.080
included on tonight's show so thank you very much for that all right let's move on and travel around

01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:37.160
the world and check out some release dates and we're going to start in the us loki all right not

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:43.560
a whole lot this week so we've got of course disaster report for summer memories on pc

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:49.480
nintendo switch and playstation 4 and then of course final fantasy 7 remake is going to be

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:54.520
coming out on playstation 4 and that's it yeah and i imagine with everything else going on in

01:25:54.520 --> 01:26:00.200
the world some of these uh things are you know in influx in limbo and all that good stuff so uh

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:04.120
trying to pull up the japanese release dates it's being very slow but i'm pretty sure that

01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:10.280
final fantasy 7 remake is also a thing uh but on the nintendo switch you can look forward to

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:18.440
um let's see a uh i guess there's a whole bunch of animal crossing um like accessories that are

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:23.960
out this week but i don't see any actual new games on the switch this week probably because over on

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:30.440
the playstation 4 the final fantasy 7 remake is out and final fantasy 7 game or fun fantasy games

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:35.560
including 7 tend to do very well in japan uh the only other thing i see uh that is coming out in

01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:41.240
japan this week is a tom clancy rainbow 6 siege deluxe edition uh that is getting a japanese

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:46.360
localized release this week otherwise enjoy that final fantasy 7 remake hell you can even get a

01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:52.760
playstation 4 or a playstation 4 pro that's a special final fantasy 7 bundle so check that out

01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:58.280
but that is your big release in japan this week how about europe not a lot coming out in europe

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:06.520
as well so we've got cooking mama cook star on nintendo switch and final fantasy 7 remake oddly

01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:11.720
enough based on the release dates i have here unless that changes this is all we're getting

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:17.320
for the next few weeks uh with everything that's going on in the world i'm not completely surprised

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:22.920
to hear that to be honest so um it is what it is you notice we're hearing other things get shift

01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:27.800
back and moved around and i think some of these retail sites that we use to get this information

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:34.280
are probably changing because the retail end of things is uh kind of closing down and changing so

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:39.640
yeah anyway uh i need to pull up the mailbag here you know what maybe we'll do things a little bit

01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:43.240
out of order uh loki do you want to read the next story here while i pull up the mailbag

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:50.120
sure so this is kind of a continuation like we had last week where we're talking a little bit

01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:55.320
about gamestop and there is a little bit we could talk about game as well but um talking a little

01:27:55.320 --> 01:28:01.400
bit more about game exchange so you may remember game exchange is kind of an independent retailer

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:08.040
that is similar to a gamestop in certain regions of the united states well um last week we had

01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:14.040
employees kind of speaking out saying that you know there's issues with you know the sort of

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:19.080
thinking that it could be deemed essential considering that gamestop is they're saying

01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:27.240
they're essential so apparently though now instead of actually uh providing them with you know

01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:34.360
instructions to close their stores they've been providing them with tips to keep safe instead so

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:40.040
like take a sip of warm water every 12 or 20 minutes this keeps your mouth moist and washes

01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:45.080
away any viruses that enter your mouth into your stomach where your gastric juices will neutralize

01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:50.360
it these are no these are like fucking bullshit facebook chain posts that like really bored

01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:57.320
karens are spreading around that are quite harmful actually yes so basically a bunch of these types

01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:06.920
of uh things you know try avoiding cold it's just doesn't make any sense um so yeah so they've been

01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:13.960
given this kind of information via an email that was sent to staff on tuesday um and apparently

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:21.400
this is from their vice president of retail operations Mindy Kent it's just it's ridiculous

01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:26.840
and they really need to close these stores down but based on what i'm hearing and there was

01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:31.080
another video that came out this week about you know some of the gamestop stuff and of course

01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:37.560
a lot of that is still like rumor until we get from like other sources but um basically saying

01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:44.360
that gamestop legal is trying to find a way to find a loophole where they can stay as um

01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:49.080
as trying to deem themselves essential and reopen their stores or they have reopened their stores

01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:54.520
and are basically fighting the situation and i've read that there's several states that have

01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:58.520
actually cracked down on them to the point where they've just sent in police to shut them down

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.960
yeah and i think it's logical we just flow into the next story here before you get to

01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:09.960
the mailbag and talk about the game stops in massachusetts so all the game stops in

01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:14.120
massachusetts have closed and uh it doesn't sound like it was something they really wanted to do

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:19.480
but here's what happened the inspection services department for the city of boston went to the

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:25.080
dorchester store and basically ordered them to close they didn't get a fine but they got issued

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:31.320
a nuisance order so yes gamestop got declared a public nuisance this week for their antics at

01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:37.560
least in boston they did um so they actually followed up went back on wednesday to make sure

01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:42.200
that it was closed and gamestop confirmed to a report in the boston globe they did close all

01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:48.680
massachusetts stores on thursday um don't know if gamestop is shut down in any other states

01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:53.160
although california where we're at they did all close they had to follow the governor's order

01:30:55.160 --> 01:31:00.040
yeah remember i i said that there might be a possibility of getting posters well i don't

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:03.960
think that's going to happen they've already taken signage of the store that's closing nearby here

01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:08.040
and i mean it makes sense i don't even know when they would be reopening in the first place

01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:14.040
yeah so oh well yeah it's it's a bummer we lost out on that but completely understandable due to

01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:18.280
everything else that's going on in the world for sure yeah so all right i think we can now uh take

01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:22.440
a trip back up to the mailbag and i can read some of these emails that came in uh because we

01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:25.800
actually got some emails this week thank you very much and if you want to send some emails

01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:30.920
participate at orange lounge trader.com is the place to send those emails so let's go to our

01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:36.600
first email tonight from sia tabiri who says hello everyone i often mean to write in but because i'm

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:40.200
usually in the chat room i tend to neglect the whole email thing well that's okay we love that

01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:44.840
you're participating one way or another i know that licensed games are generally not accepted

01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:51.080
well but are there any non-video game properties you would like to see adapted into a game if so

01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:55.720
what genre would best fit it and what specific mechanics would you like to see in that game

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:01.480
the easiest thing that comes to mind for me is i want to see more game shows adapted like one

01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:07.000
versus 100 on xbox 360. i think that's like my easy go-to answer because that was a real crime

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:11.880
what happened with that whole thing and that it's not around anymore so that's like my easy

01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:15.880
go-to answer but let me continue on with sia tabiri's email and then i'll get loki's answer

01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:23.160
personally i would love to see a telltale games type enhanced visual novel a la wolf among us

01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:28.040
for the tv series version of the magicians or perhaps something more along the lines of

01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:32.840
psychonauts where you delve into different magicians power sets to tell a more original

01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:37.480
story within the universe i hope you're all doing well and that this question wasn't as dumb as i'm

01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:43.480
starting to feel like it was take care no it's not a dumb question uh what type of uh license

01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:48.600
i open this up to chad as well what do you guys think what's like a um like a licensed property

01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:56.600
you want to see put into a game loki any thoughts yeah so a licensed property i'd love to see

01:32:57.480 --> 01:33:06.680
would be a um a vr version of nailed it it's my head my my brain was going to nailed it as well

01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:11.560
so i was thinking of a cooking mama crossover somehow except one that isn't farming for bitcoin

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:17.000
or or if we want to like really get rid of this aside from just vr let's just have the folks from

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:25.160
uh that created uh surgeon simulator to do nailed it just have a really crappy like control thing

01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:29.960
where you have to move the hands and stuff i just want the commentary from nicole buyer because i

01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:34.600
fucking love her speaking of nailed it by the way if i don't mention this tweet at some point during

01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:38.920
the show i'm gonna get a nasty gram from shane because he tweeted me earlier this week apparently

01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:46.440
in the first episode of the new season of nailed it they use music from mass effect and like it's

01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:50.360
it's like it's music that was made for mass effect and it's on the mass effect soundtrack it's the

01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:55.400
synthesis ending music of all things is in nailed it he even sent me the clip on my on my twitter

01:33:55.400 --> 01:34:01.240
account uh and it's it's so it's just funny that you're seeing these uh video game things get used

01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:06.360
in other places how do they even find that music to use i don't know it's just like a there's weird

01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:13.080
probably some nerd on staff that decided that hey i'm gonna sneak this in there you know they

01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:17.240
i'm sure they have the license it but i'm just gonna slide it in there for the few people that

01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:24.680
will even get what it is uh phoenix 77 26 says how about trauma center like a game centered around

01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:30.600
house md i like that one uh tiger claw says how about a video game adaptation of the rocky horror

01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:35.720
picture show but call it the rocky horror video game show so believe it or not that's already

01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:43.080
happened except it was um a game adaptation of the play the rocky horror show um and that is on

01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:51.080
way back in the commodore 64 days uh and uh they did make a new one on cd rom when they did the i

01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:55.160
think there was a revival i don't remember if they made it around the new york city broadway revival

01:34:55.160 --> 01:35:01.000
or if it was around a british revival in like 2005 or something like that but spoiler alert

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:10.680
neither game can you mute loki loki go on mute classic zoom meeting uh but i guess here's

01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:16.600
mechanical keyboard but spoiler alert neither rocky horror game was very good um but just

01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:19.800
if you didn't know they actually did make those games and neither were very good

01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:28.680
um speaking of uh i said newer phoenix newer uh speaking of um uh things that didn't translate

01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:34.200
very well phoenix had suggested what would you think of a drag race game they did a dragopolis

01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:42.280
do you remember that it was on cell phones and also not the best game in the world sorry to say

01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:47.480
sorry i know some developers probably did their best on it but it was just too limited by the

01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:52.360
mobile phone and it's just i think that game is not the reason why people watch drag race you

01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:57.240
know people watch drag race for the horrible puns and the lip syncing and the fun challenges and

01:35:57.240 --> 01:36:01.400
things like that and as much as i think sure a drag race game would be a great idea and i think

01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:06.440
i've joked about it before in like a dream game or something have you ever played project runway on

01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:11.480
the we and let's be real ruble's drag race is a spoof of like project runway and america's next

01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:16.280
top model it started as a spoof but then it like became self-aware somewhere along the line um

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:24.200
but the point is project runaway on the we mama this is garbage it's the best way i could put it

01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:28.840
it's not good uh so i don't know how a rupaul's drag race game would just like be good like it's

01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:34.680
just it's just not going to be good um but i suppose you know i i linked in uh twitch chat

01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:39.880
be linked because thankfully all of these characters oh yeah the Commodore 64 games are in

01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:45.000
the archive so they have a rocky horror show thank you oh there you go tiger claw go check that out

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.360
maybe it'll be a classic game of the week sometime although again it's not very good

01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:53.320
it's really not good all right uh oh and act deft are responding to the nailed it thing and

01:36:53.320 --> 01:37:01.000
shane's tweet saying rob in mexico a lot of news shows use video game music a lot like no joke

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:06.040
it's almost a meme it's kind of funny i don't know why that's so funny anyway well thank you

01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:11.240
see you tiberi for the email that was good uh moving on to another email from ronma tonight

01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:15.480
who emailed us participate at orange lounge radio.com and you should too for next week

01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:21.080
rama asks there hasn't been much in the way of talking about food so here's a question for you

01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:28.600
all what is your favorite go-to comfort food mine is what some people call roman holiday or goulash

01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:34.280
it's a mix of pasta sauce meat and cheese i can make a big batch of it and eat it all day and all

01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:39.800
week and not be bored with it that's all for now till next time i'm sure a lot of people i'm

01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:45.480
putting on i'm putting on quarantine wait because of all the stinking food i'm eating being trapped

01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:51.320
at home and there's plenty of comfort food snacks in there but do you have a go-to comfort food

01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:58.040
loki no but i have important information so you may remember that you know i was obsessed with

01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:04.440
bond's uh honey butter chicken for a while and they of course closed down and i have not been

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:10.840
able to fill that void until recently when i decided to make wings and i found a honey

01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:19.000
butter recipe that i used and that stuff is crack it is absolute crack i love it i will make as much

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:24.520
of that sauce as possible and i will literally now put it on anything and it is awesome so so

01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:31.640
loki's answer is honey butter basically yes three tablespoons butter three tablespoons honey one

01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:37.160
tablespoon of soy sauce and chopped garlic probably about two cloves or so mix that all

01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:42.840
together simmer it in a pot or whatever and just like dip everything in it i did not expect loki

01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:46.920
would be the one i'm getting cooking tips from on the show don't worry cooking loki will fix it

01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:53.240
um let's see so my comfort food uh so we have this local chain and they're not paying me to

01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:57.320
give an advertisement but i'm going to anyway and and loki mentions them all the time on the

01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:00.280
show anyway because he brings their food in all the time but it's round table pizza i think they're

01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:04.760
a west coast thing i don't think they have them on the east coast but they have them like arizona

01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:11.400
and stuff right okay so they're pretty bomb pizza and like the pepperoni and olive specifically

01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:16.840
takes me back to being a kid and like that used to be the pizza that my grandma would order when

01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:20.760
i would go like stay with her for a weekend and things like like it would be it would always be

01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:24.200
exciting times to go to grandma's house for the weekend because she would without fail

01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:29.960
always order pepperoni and olive pizza from round table which is that's the one we just got so um

01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:35.160
yeah i guess i gave him free ad but whatever it uh it's it is comfort food i know that's weird

01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:38.520
because it's not really something you make in your kitchen but i still think comfort food kind of

01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:45.880
evokes a certain memory um the other one and this would go back to grandma's house as well because

01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:52.360
she always had a well-stocked cupboard of sour cream and onion pringles because i think they

01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:57.560
were probably her favorite but they're definitely mine as well and uh i i probably ate or had ate

01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:02.760
her out of house at home uh on those um sour cream and onion pringles and that would be

01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:06.840
another comfort food and another company that didn't pay me to give them an ad but it is what

01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:13.480
it is i mean that's the comfort food i like so um act dev says i do remember them uh round table

01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:18.200
we used to have one in the city next to where i live i used to play in the arcade it had oh yeah

01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:23.320
the the i always forget round table like i guess they technically still have arcades but they're

01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:28.440
you know crappy crane games and things like that but back in the day they have the clubhouse once

01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:35.480
now they have uh crappy a little bit larger of an arcade yeah but yeah it's still they

01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:41.240
they still technically each have an arcade but they're like yeah they're crappy but that used

01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:48.120
to be the place where without fail there was always an iron man iron stewart super off-road

01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:51.560
game always that game was in every fucking round table i've ever been to

01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:56.680
and um so that which that game was fucking great it's one of my all-time favorite arcade games we

01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:01.000
don't talk about it enough on the show how fucking great that game is the first round table and see

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:06.120
because this is back pizza places used to be just like i don't know what it is nowadays where

01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:10.840
everything's all bright and cheery but they used to be dingy and dark that's always like all of

01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:15.320
these places even like like shakies do you forget am i am i that old that i'm the only one that

01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:20.680
remembers shaky's pizza but going to shaky's pizza was going to like a fucking like like damp castle

01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:28.360
with the gigantic doors it was something it was super dark but i remember like um

01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:34.280
at the first round table i'd ever been to uh i think it's the first one um they used to play

01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:39.000
pole position there because they used to have this arcade that was kind of just down these stairs and

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:45.080
not really like a basement but it was like down some stairs in a room um but yeah it was it was

01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:48.920
always very dark i remember all of them being dark and even chuckie cheese was like that

01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:54.520
actually you know what that might have to do with some of the things these uh kind of are

01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:57.800
derivatives of because now that i didn't really think about this until you mentioned that but

01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:04.200
now that i think about it like i remember going to a fancy um uh deep dish place in chicago uh it

01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:09.080
was actually a misty because we were we didn't get to go because the weight was like forever but it

01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:13.160
was very dark in there and it was all like candle lit type of thing and then i'm thinking have you

01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:18.360
been to zelda's in downtown sac it's all candle lit it's all dark and candle lit there so i think

01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:24.040
there's something about like pizza places be and i feel like chicago fire is a pretty dark place

01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:27.160
too i don't know if it's only like chicago because zelda's is a really good deep dish place i don't

01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:31.400
know if it's like a deep dish pizza thing or what but i feel like the dark pizza place thing like

01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:38.200
goes back like it's not just chain restaurants that we remember growing up who knows but then

01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:42.040
i also remember straw hat which was in a strip mall and it was very bright because the windows

01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:47.240
were right there so they weren't all dark all right anyway there we go pizza discussion thank

01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:51.160
you uh rama i hope we didn't let you down with that and rama i know about it because i know

01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:56.200
you're from new york i know better that it get into the chicago versus new york pizza i'm not

01:42:56.200 --> 01:43:01.960
going to do that i'm i'm a fat boy and i'm going to say there is room for both there is i love them

01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:07.480
both so i'm not going to get into the chicago versus new york debate yes to both that is the

01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:12.920
correct answer what i want to find out though is they have this new pizza place pizza bar place

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:17.880
that's opened up um that i haven't been to i keep driving by though it's called boston's pizza

01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:25.080
and i'm curious to see what boston style pizza is interesting it's just i don't know it's the

01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:29.160
new pizza place got chicken up do you remember though speaking since we've given chicago pizza

01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:35.000
a highlight do you remember though there used to be that new york pizza place um it was over in

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:40.760
sowsack and it was i don't remember the name of it but they had a max it was the only max 2 machine

01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:45.320
in town for the longest time and they had some fucking delicious pizza do you remember that place

01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:50.760
it was no i don't remember no i know you went once it was in south sacramento

01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:55.240
off fruit ridge or something and like that's that's quite a drive for like i think at the

01:43:55.240 --> 01:43:57.960
time i was out in roseville or something that's quite a drive down there but it was

01:43:57.960 --> 01:44:02.040
like the only place in town you can play max 2 for a little bit so anyway

01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:12.520
uh i i don't think i ever went there act deft in chats no it wasn't godfather's it was it was

01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:17.080
definitely it was in new york was giovanni's because there is a giovanni one here in sack

01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:20.280
but it's not in south side but anyway i think it might have been that but anyway it was it

01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:25.800
was definitely new york pizza um let's see uh act deft in chat says which style of pizza do you

01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:33.400
prefer yes that is exactly exactly that the only i am not a fan of chicago style pizza

01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:38.040
yeah i love i love them both like there's a time and a place for both i really do and i

01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:41.960
understand i understand some people like poo poo on the chicago thing because you're eating

01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:46.360
it with a knife and a fork so it's not but you know what i'm just i'm i'm not here to debate it

01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:54.920
i'm just here to eat it if you want to fight me on chicago pizza i will eat that pizza before

01:44:54.920 --> 01:45:00.200
you're done arguing and then you won't have a problem all right anyway let's move on all right

01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:05.000
we got past the game exchange and game stop thing uh let's talk about this because this is uh an

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:08.680
another unfortunate kind of side effect of everything that's going on in the world and

01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:13.800
that is that the national game museum is saying that they are in danger of closing because of

01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:17.720
what's going on with the coronavirus i do want to point out this is the national video game museum

01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:24.440
in the uk uh and you can follow them on twitter at nvmuk and they actually made a tweet saying

01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:29.640
we need your help the uk's only museum dedicated to video game culture and education is threatened

01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:35.720
with permanent closure by coronavirus despite 40 000 visitors in 2019 we have no safety net of

01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:40.920
funding to ensure our new charity atlas a prolonged shutdown the uk is in danger of

01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:46.120
losing this unique venue with nearly 100 playable exhibits school workshops and family events so

01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:50.920
they're actually doing a crowdfunding page to try to i guess make up some of the stop gap that

01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:56.200
they're losing because you know we're on a shutdown here in the us in most states

01:45:56.200 --> 01:46:02.920
i think there are better than the yelp crowdfund idea that they oh yeah oh god that was horrible

01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:07.080
that was horrible no this isn't this is a officially sanctioned by and on their official

01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:13.960
twitter uh and nvmuk yeah if you guys didn't hear about that yelp man that's so shitty what they did

01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:19.800
they were setting up uh crowdfunding things and the owners didn't even know about it all the time

01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:25.960
it's just really shady anyway um anyway but this is official and is something you should look uh

01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:30.920
be checking into especially if you are over in the uk but you can certainly help uh from anywhere so

01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:37.560
um check that out over on their official twitter for more information nvmuk all right let's move

01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:41.720
on loki what do you have for us before we get towards the end of the show here so this is

01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:51.960
amazing uh but there's actually a new game coming from atari it's a pong rpg so it's pong quest and

01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:57.880
it looks very cute it's got these qt graphics and you play like a pong paddle that's dressed up in

01:46:57.880 --> 01:47:04.920
costumes and you fight other pong paddles as well so they have character customization and it's a

01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:11.640
very tongue-in-cheek looking game it's being developed by uh uk design duo uh checkered inc

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:17.800
huh it's supposed to be coming out in consoles and pc this spring it's interesting to see all

01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:21.960
the different ways they've reinvented pong over the years that's for sure yeah they have like

01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:27.160
incorporate other atari games into it so they have like uh stuff in the trailer about centipede and

01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:33.480
adventure so it's kind of cool very cool all right and one more story for you guys about you know

01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:39.240
what what is sorry it has an autoplay video on the site uh what what are they doing on sports tv

01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:43.160
when there's no sports um because we're not able to get together in sporting arenas and things like

01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:46.920
that and of course as we've talked about over the last few weeks there seems to be this growing

01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:53.720
trend into esports and espn took that up another notch this past weekend i must admit i didn't see

01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:58.440
it maybe some of you in chat did and want to tell me about it but my understanding is that the nba

01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:04.840
and 2k kind of came together to do an nba 2k tournament that was on espn and espn 2 and it

01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:09.320
actually all started on friday and it's running through april 11th so we're in the middle of it

01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:15.080
right now um it was uh on espn on friday with a half hour pre-show and then they ran it um

01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:21.400
on espn for like an hour and a half and it went over to espn 2 uh and there are 16 nba players

01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:26.600
competing including kevin durant uh donovan mitchell devin booker so there's lots of uh

01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:33.480
nba celebrities competing in this the winner of the event will get 100 000 to give to a charity

01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:38.120
supporting coronavirus relief specifically so that's going to be a win-win situation

01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:45.320
um all together and uh is definitely an example of what you got to do on tv right now to um

01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:50.600
fill in the time because we don't know when the nba or any of that stuff is coming back and it's

01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:54.840
kind of like something i alluded to earlier in the show you know a lot of these sports events have

01:48:55.640 --> 01:49:01.240
thousands of people that go to the arenas and they may not want those large gatherings for a little

01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:08.920
while um maybe they'll allow and again i'm just fortune telling here listen to doctors as a

01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:14.680
scientist maybe they'll allow smaller groups like 50 so that maybe they can get the the the people

01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:18.120
there to record the game and play the game and maybe that'll be okay maybe they just play it

01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:22.520
to empty stadiums but we don't know we we just don't know the future is kind of uncertain in

01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:28.360
that way um so they're having to fill the time right now with what to do um sj100 matt says the

01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:32.200
reviews i've read is that it's kind of boring i don't know if these reviewers are gamers but i

01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:36.360
think people were expecting players to heavy trash talk each other and they're not doing that it's

01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:40.600
kind of quiet between the players i have yet to see it so it's kind of what the early vibe seems

01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:45.000
to say is that maybe it's not the side of the players we're used to seeing on the court because

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:48.360
it's a little more casual maybe because for charity they're toning it down i don't know

01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:53.080
um act f says some soccer leagues are doing something similar and i think f1 racing is also

01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:58.120
doing it and streaming it on twitch and bobby blackwolf says espn was showing the madden

01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:03.960
championships today but it was a rerun from back in december and january so uh very interesting

01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:10.840
to see the sports um folks having to really fill time i mean on the good side of things

01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:19.000
there's no bars right now to gather to see these in anyway but i'm sure these tv companies are like

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:23.960
that's our bread and butter what are we going to do so it seems you know like definitely these um

01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:28.440
online things are kind of filling in the gap a little bit so that you know people will still uh

01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:33.880
be there to tune in and the flip side of that might be that tv ends up being the only way to

01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:37.960
participate in these things for a little while so there might you know might be a little time

01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:43.080
of weirdness but then it's going to kind of pay off double hopefully um well i don't know i'd

01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:46.920
rather go back to the old way but you know what i mean uh for the folks that all are working and

01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:51.960
making the tv they can um get back into that hopefully a little earlier than everything else

01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:58.600
we'll see so all right nifty 805 says chicken wing sales are down yeah when there's no football

01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:04.520
parties that's not necessarily true chicken wings are very hard to find really well but wingstop is

01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:09.880
like that half their business comes from uh ball games and things like that i'm sure well true i'm

01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:14.280
talking about like in stores because people keep uh oh yeah that's doing awesome i've had to go

01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:18.200
like see recently when i go grocery shopping i have to go to three stores to get everything that

01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:25.240
we need yeah uh which is not necessarily fun but it's been less crazy this week um i did end up i

01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:31.640
found paper towels which is ridiculous um that was a random thing i found early on too is paper

01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:37.080
towels and luckily we have plenty of toilet paper because alan like the week before we went on the

01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:42.680
cruise alan bought some and then that was when all hell broke loose so anyway uh it is time for the

01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:46.360
listener roundtable i'm sorry it's a typo there in the sidebar because i used an old template it's

01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:49.720
listed around table via chat tonight we're not gonna be able to do discord so if you have any

01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:54.920
questions for us in chat uh go ahead and put those in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network

01:51:54.920 --> 01:52:00.360
if you have anything uh you'd like to ask us there uh pod culture and chat saying yeah even wonderfest

01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:08.360
is up in the air now i am accepting the reality that dragon con could not happen i'm crossing my

01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:13.720
fingers and toes that it does but i think there's just a lot of unanswered question marks still on

01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:18.840
the whole thing uh again just because we can get back to some sense of normalcy are they going to

01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:24.040
want 80 000 people to get together i don't know again i think it's just too early to say um i did

01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:31.640
buy my flights this past week because here this is what i think will happen flights are really

01:52:31.640 --> 01:52:36.440
cheap right now i don't know if you're aware but flights are really cheap right now so i wanted to

01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:42.280
get in on the good deal because i have a feeling when they do say it's okay to fly again you're

01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:48.040
gonna have all these business travelers snatching it up to catch up on lost work and the price of

01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:52.280
those air tickets is gonna go way up because that backlog of people who haven't been able to travel

01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:56.600
for a while are gonna suddenly want to do it so that's just you know i i don't know anything and

01:52:56.600 --> 01:53:01.480
if airlines do close or whatever i feel like airline tickets may be a little harder to come

01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:06.520
by for a bit so i wanted to lock that in now and the airline that i'm flying has a pretty generous

01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:11.000
refund policy in this scenario you can imagine like they they change their policies specifically

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:17.240
for things bought in the month of april uh and and march so i feel okay about it that if if for

01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:21.240
whatever reason the convention doesn't happen i could still use that money and just put it towards

01:53:21.240 --> 01:53:27.640
2021 or go on a different trip when it's more appropriate too i don't know so we'll see again

01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:34.760
it's too early to say but i i am mentally preparing myself to be disappointed because it would be very

01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:40.760
disappointing but i yeah it i mean it is what it is we have to save lives so that's the most

01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:46.360
important thing so uh anyhow uh dart tetsuya is wondering hey have any of you all seen king's

01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:51.000
avatar on netflix it's a chinese drama but it's all about this online mmo thing a bunch of

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:55.720
different guilds playing together no i haven't heard of that is it um is it like a documentary

01:53:55.720 --> 01:54:03.480
or is it just a scripted thing that's kind of interesting be curious about that so let's see

01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:11.400
also um oh yeah some folks are talking about wrestlemania um because that's a sporting event

01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:16.040
that's going on right now peso paca says wrestlemania was definitely odd how quiet it is

01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:20.280
outside of hearing the narrators and wrestlers screaming and grunts yeah i bet that was really

01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:25.480
weird and i guess they did that at their own facility they didn't do it um they didn't like

01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:29.160
empty out a stadium or anything like that like they kind of did it in their own studio or

01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:33.080
something i didn't watch it so i couldn't tell you but i'm sure a lot of you guys were watching

01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:37.800
it and i'm sure i have plenty to say about it uh okay dark tetsuya says uh that was a scripted

01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:45.160
drama so interesting all right nifty by the way in chat is linking to an article one thing there's

01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:50.440
definitely no short of right now is chicken wings so i guess that's just at your local store loki i

01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:55.240
don't know it probably was yeah we went to the store yesterday because we were starting to run

01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:59.640
out of some things and oh but i don't want to i you can see how there's some people that just

01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:06.040
don't care about like what's going on and being very careless so i'm just like oh meanwhile i'm

01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:11.160
like i don't have any face masks but i have a scarf from those trips i've taken back east when

01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:14.520
it's cold so i kind of like wrap the scarf around my face that's like all i could do

01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:18.840
even though i wasn't coughing or anything but still you know just to

01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:21.400
just out of an abundance of caution so anyway

01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:28.360
all right well any last minute stories for us loki yes um so i wanted to talk about because

01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:34.120
we didn't talk about i mean obviously this week april fool's day was and and i understand that

01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:39.080
a lot of people think april fools is canceled yeah i'm one of them that's why i didn't slot it

01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:48.200
so one company though that took it very seriously of course is mojang and mojang released a brand

01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:56.920
new snapshot from minecraft that's absolutely incredible so it's called snapshot 20w14 infinity

01:55:56.920 --> 01:56:04.840
and is the ultimate content update now what did they do to the game they added two billion worlds

01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:15.080
into the game based on player input and um so what this does is actually you know in minecraft

01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:21.160
there's another portal that'll take you to the nether so with this update if you take a book

01:56:21.880 --> 01:56:27.640
in the game and you write whatever you want in the book that creates a new seed for a brand new

01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:34.360
universe basically that you throw it into the portal walk through it and it'll take you to

01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:40.680
one of these procedurally generated worlds based on your seed that you create so it's all sorts of

01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:46.680
weird glitchy looking things that are out there plus there's several different uh worlds that they

01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:52.600
made themselves kind of like easter eggs that you can work to as well or find amongst all of these

01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:57.080
two billion worlds that are in there and at first like when i saw like the youtube videos i thought

01:56:57.080 --> 01:57:01.320
oh this is just like people trying to play pranks but i saw more and more of them and actually

01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:07.800
watched you know how it works and no it's a legit update that adds a ton of replayability

01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:15.400
into the game and funny enough they added an advancement or achievement into the game

01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:21.560
for visiting one billion of those worlds so you know visit one billion of them in order to get

01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:26.920
that achievement but they have all sorts of weird stuff in there and brand new blocks that they

01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:33.240
created specifically for this now this is aside from um the nether update which is supposed to

01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:38.360
be coming as well to java but i mean i can't wait to check this out i downloaded this today to go

01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:43.480
um play around in it but i haven't gotten a chance to play it yet because i need to reload all my uh

01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:49.000
i had some scripts for using controllers in the java version and stuff like that because i have

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:54.360
a new pc now i got reload all that stuff and it sucks but yeah it's really crazy just some of the

01:57:54.360 --> 01:58:00.200
stuff that generates in this game so right there's uh they have like skyblock stuff in there now

01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:06.280
there's just a bunch of weird dimensions that this is created so um worth checking out if you

01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:12.680
have the java version go download the beta client or the snapshot release and go jump into a billion

01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:21.000
different worlds all right anything else uh that's it all right let me get this last question here

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:25.960
from s100 max i think this is a good one uh over in our chat question because i'm finding new ways

01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:32.200
to entertain myself i challenged myself to 100 super mario world within a week on just pure

01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:37.080
memory no online checking are there any games that you know so well you can pick it up and

01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:42.120
beat without researching anything uh i might struggle a little bit especially in the water

01:58:42.120 --> 01:58:50.440
levels but uh super metroid i'm pretty sure i could uh pecking crash my way through uh probably

01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:55.240
final fantasy two and three which are really four and six of course on super nintendo i could

01:58:55.240 --> 01:58:58.280
probably get through those again too but those those are actually kind of linear i don't think

01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:03.160
it's that hard to pick those games up and um you know because everything is kind of like gated you

01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:06.680
know like metroid can't get to this point unless you have this can't get to this point unless you

01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:11.240
have this so um i don't know if either of those answers are as impressive but i feel like those

01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:14.760
are two games i could definitely pick up uh loki what about you is there something you could like

01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:23.000
pick up in full clear just from muscle memory um i don't know like it would have to i can't think

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:28.040
of an older game that i would have played so much of that i could do that oh uh akuma jp says i

01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:32.280
think sftn symphony of the night i think um it would be yeah symphony of the night that's a good

01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:37.000
one too i bet that's one jamie could do uh act f says i could also do shovel knight from memory oh

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:43.480
that's a pretty good one as well so nice bobby blackwolf says adventure for the 2600 so

01:59:44.760 --> 01:59:48.840
that's another one that well no actually some some parts of that can be pretty tricky i think

01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:52.280
so but there's some other ones i'd like to challenge myself with like the original metal

01:59:52.280 --> 01:59:56.680
gear on nes i bet that would be a fun one to try again see if i can remember how to get through

01:59:56.680 --> 02:00:00.760
some of those mazes and things like that all right anyway we're gonna wrap up for the night

02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:05.000
thank you guys so much for uh tuning into orange launch radio or watching us live however you

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:08.840

02:00:16.280 --> 02:00:22.200
uh so help us spread the word we really appreciate it um uh auto hosting on twitch that goes a super

02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:26.760
long way really appreciate that but otherwise just tell a friend or two where you might have heard

02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:31.240
about this show uh and how to find it and that would be awesome a nice five-star review on a

02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:38.280
podcasting site like itunes those go a long way as well uh and again just take care of yourself guys

02:00:38.280 --> 02:00:43.160
uh take it seriously what doctors out there are saying um staying at home means you got to stay

02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:46.600
at home like as much as you want to see your friends and you're probably uh really want to

02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:49.640
hang out with them like i would love to yeah you know there was a part of me that was like

02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:54.520
why don't i just have loki over it's just loki but then i thought well it's you're you know who

02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:58.920
knows i may be sick and not really showing it and then you know i don't want to i don't want to give

02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:03.320
that to loki so uh staying away from people means staying away from people and if we can work

02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:09.880
together uh we will uh get rid of this thing a lot faster so please stay safe stay healthy

02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:14.280
make good choices and all that good stuff um with that loki your final thought tonight

02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:21.800
my final thought is i'm gonna play more uh try to play more games i've been trying to get to

02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:28.040
where i can programming um i've worked so like this week i've got uh replacement parts coming

02:01:28.040 --> 02:01:33.400
from my switch as well because my switch has been acting up um so i'm gonna fix the joy cons

02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:39.320
manually and but i still have an issue with the stupid sd card we're like literally just holding

02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:44.360
the switch and it keeps saying that the sd card is being disconnected so there's something weird

02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:51.560
at that so i'm gonna take it apart and hopefully not break it good luck with that uh where i'm

02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:56.760
actually getting some new computer parts as well because my main computer uh keeps freezing suddenly

02:01:56.760 --> 02:02:00.200
like it doesn't happen all the time but i i was wondering if it's like an overheating thing or

02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:03.800
something is it'll like freeze in the middle of a game i have to shut the system off bring it back

02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:09.400
up but i don't know it's just it's just really annoying me so check your fans and make sure

02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:13.880
they're not they are we give it we give it a big dusting we took the and it still did a freeze up

02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:18.920
on me so i don't know what the hell's going on so um i was like well maybe it's an excuse to buy
