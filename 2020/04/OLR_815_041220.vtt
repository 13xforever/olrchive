Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Here's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:22.000
Tonight we have gaming news of a possibly 35 year old bug, re-examining a 15 year old bug, and PC builders doing their civic duty for today's reality and remake new content

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
Stay tuned for the recent articles about old content and news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 815 for this April the 12th of 2020

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
Happy Easter out there to those of you that celebrate it

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
To other folks out there, including our very own DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, a very happy bunny day

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
No, it's still Passover so Chag Pesach Hasanah to everybody

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
Oh yes, there is that still going on as well, I thought that was midweek

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Which ends before my birthday

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Well happy that to you as well

01:09.000 --> 01:16.000
I get cake for my birthday and it's gonna be a carrot cake with no raisins and I'll be on the show too

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Oh good, well I mean

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
This is next Sunday

01:19.000 --> 01:26.000
Good and not good, I mean I know you'd probably rather be out at the Cherry Blossom Festival or some of the things you usually do on your birthday weekend

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
But it's a weird year, we're doing different things

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
Yeah, I mean I haven't gotten to see any cherry blossoms at all this year which is usually like what I live for, you know

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
But hey, to my Jew crew listening, Chag Sameach everybody

01:42.000 --> 01:48.000
And something I've been telling all my friends that have a birthday around this time is that you know

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
At least you completely have justification to get a make up birthday when this is all over

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
So we're gonna have a lot of birthdays come July, August, June depending on when we're allowed to gather again, who knows

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Girl, you know what it's gonna be, right?

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
We're going to Disneyland

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
We're all going the fuck to Disneyland

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
I would be so down for that to be quite honest, so yeah

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
I don't care how many humans are there, I'll deal, I'll just you know

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
I don't know though, I mean this is probably gonna be a while, it's probably not gonna be until next year

02:18.000 --> 02:30.000
I mean being logical about it, they're saying you know 18 months at minimum before you know a vaccine is out and kicked in and spread amongst enough people to be effective

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Right, well we'll see

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
We'll play it safe and play it smart

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
You know we'll listen to the scientists, you know I think yeah

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
Running and going to Disneyland will probably not be the first thing because Disneyland's gonna be one of the last things to kind of come back

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
Just like you know I've got my eye on Dragon Con and I'm hopeful that Dragon Con will still happen

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
I'm hopeful that testing and all that stuff will be at a good enough place, they can do contact tracing and all that stuff

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
But if the scientists say don't do it, then it is what it is

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
You know we're gonna listen to science and make our educated decisions that way

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
I haven't heard anything on DerpyCon either so I mean that's not until the end of October

03:06.000 --> 03:15.000
But certainly next year since I'm not doing, I'm not gonna do Dragon Con anymore because I'll be perfectly honest

03:15.000 --> 03:22.000
They've kind of done one of the groups that I'm in a little bit dirty and on top of that I don't want to support

03:22.000 --> 03:30.000
I mean it's enough that I watch the show and I'll leave it that way, I'm not gonna support someone who does fracking and has been such a shit to other people

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
So I am probably gonna do Dragon Con next year

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
Don't say it if you don't mean it, don't say it if you don't mean it

03:41.000 --> 03:48.000
I need to talk to you about you know what the situation for us going and you know panels and crap but just we'll talk

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
Between Bobby and I we'll make it work, we'll make it work but yeah don't say it if you don't mean it because you're gonna get my hopes up

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
I'll put it this way, I do absolutely mean it and I will do whatever is in my power to make it happen

04:00.000 --> 04:07.000
Besides that, I have been contemplating some epic cosplays for next year

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
There you go, there you go, alright

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
Including a character I'm probably way too short to portray but hey I really like Zaki

04:13.000 --> 04:19.000
Well somebody else I'd like to get that kind of commitment from, say hello to Techmaster Loki

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Yeah, Loki

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
And Loki might be on mute, hello?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
I'm sorry my key binds aren't working

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Oh that's okay

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
It wasn't working for a second because I was typing in chat

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Alright well, oh okay, well you're multitasking, that's fine

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
And you're reminding us that we do have a live chat room because we do tape live

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
Every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
Twitch.tv slash VOG Network, V-O-G Network

04:44.000 --> 04:51.000
You can also visit us on the web at VOGNetwork.com because we have a lot of friendly podcasts that we're in this network with

04:51.000 --> 04:58.000
A lot of awesome shows that, you know, not only things we host here at VOG Network on Twitch, things like Girls Gone Wow and Anime Jam Session

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
But the interesting, not that this quarantine situation is a good thing at all

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
But if you want to look for the diamonds in the rough, shall we say

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
Some of our podcasts that have gone on hiatus, you know, just because life gets in the way sometimes

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Have found the time to record again

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
So The Geek Card just put out a new episode this last week

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
And I'm told another one is coming

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
I don't know if I'm allowed to say what yet, but they're in chat probably so maybe they'll say something

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
But yeah, so that's, you know, not the way I want shows to come back

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
But you know, hey, if it's like the one piece of good news in this situation then I will stink and take it

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
Anyway, so Loki, one of these years we gotta get you to Dragon Con as well

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
I mean, it probably won't be until the kids are 18, but we'll hope for it

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Yeah, well I would have said, yeah, definitely

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
How has your week been personally? I know usually you do family stuff today

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
So I know things have kind of changed this year, but were you able to take the kids out to a park to do

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Have a good dinner or anything like that?

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
No, we just, well we had kids this morning

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
They looked for them in our house, so we did that

06:07.000 --> 06:13.000
And then we went out to the park just to ride, they rode their bikes and stuff

06:13.000 --> 06:19.000
But like, I mean I cook all week, so like, you know, I made my

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
My honey butter chicken that stuff is like cracked, so

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
That's right, you talked about that last week, that's awesome

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
I made that yesterday, yes, I bought four pounds worth of wings and I made all of them in the house

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
So good

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
I love it

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Alright, yeah, it's interesting how this

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
You're going to leave some on my doorstep, right?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
There's not going to be any left

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
It's interesting how this situation has led people to doing more cooking

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
Alan cooked this morning, he made some lemon poppy seed muffins, they were really good

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
So he doesn't always do stuff like that, so it's cool

06:56.000 --> 07:03.000
I'm making bread with passovers over, but I decided I think tomorrow night, I'm going to try my hand at matzah

07:03.000 --> 07:10.000
Mmm, yum yum, matzah is penance

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
So yeah, lots of food to eat while we're playing lots of games

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
And I know there's been lots of game playing amongst the crew this week

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
We'll get into that in a bit, but we like to start usually with a kickoff topic

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
So this week's kickoff topic has to do with Nintendo Switch

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
Which has, you know, is already probably the most popular console out there

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
I think that would be a fair statement to make right now

07:31.000 --> 07:37.000
Especially because we know PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are kind of on the, you know, they're on their way out the door

07:37.000 --> 07:45.000
As we know, PlayStation 5 and Xbox, I keep wanting to call it the XX, but Xbox Series X are on their way in the door

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Just go with your instincts

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
That's right, go with what you know

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
So the Switch is probably really the king of the hill right now

07:52.000 --> 08:03.000
Especially when you consider things like Animal Crossing is just like, it's become like this pop culture icon amongst this situation

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
It has proven to be like the ultimate form of escapism

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
So, so many people want to get their hands on a Switch

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
And it's actually come to the point where the Switch supply is really low

08:13.000 --> 08:19.000
And like let's be real, Nintendo isn't the greatest when it comes to hardware demand and all that stuff anyway

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
And this situation, you know, I'm not trying to make light of the situation

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
But this situation just isn't helping what's already usually a rough ride for Nintendo

08:26.000 --> 08:32.000
What I mean by that, Nintendo announced this week that they suspended shipments of, excuse me

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
Can't do anything about that, sneeze is live on air

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
Nintendo suspended shipments of the Nintendo Switch system in Japan

08:40.000 --> 08:47.000
This is only a temporary thing because if you're not aware, the COVID-19 situation is increasing in Japan

08:47.000 --> 08:53.000
We're probably a couple weeks behind where we've been at in regards to, you know, how it's spreading through the population and so forth

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
So this is just a temporary move, Nintendo says

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
But it does mean that devices are not shipping outside of reservations

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
They don't know when shipments will resume

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
They are saying that this move does not affect consumers in Europe and North America

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
But I feel like that just can't be true

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
And I don't know if that maybe goes all the way back to when China has been going through some of these things

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
And the factory and the productions there were kind of seeing the trickle down effects

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
But I know people that are trying to get their hands on a Nintendo Switch

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
And it really isn't the easiest thing to do right now

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
To give you an idea of the situation in Japan

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
The Switch stock is so low that retailers are starting to do lotteries

09:37.000 --> 09:47.000
So a Japanese store named Yamada Denke put up a lottery to potentially buy 130 Switch consoles

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
And 900 copies of Ring Fit Adventure

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Which is another really hard thing to find right now

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Probably because it involves hardware

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
It has that little ring that goes with it, that resistance band

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
And so it probably limits the number of those that Nintendo can put out

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
200,000 people entered the lottery

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
199,000 of them flippers

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
No, I'm just kidding

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
But I'm also probably not sadly

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
But 200,000 people entered the lottery

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
That is for one retailer

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
So yeah, Nintendo is trying to ship more units

10:20.000 --> 10:27.000
But that gives you an idea how crazy the supply and the demand is right there right now in Japan

10:27.000 --> 10:33.000
So what is it about the Nintendo Switch that is driving people crazy for it

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
I can tell you

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Let me come to you, Dark Sakura, for your opinion

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
But I just want to say, especially now in this quarantine COVID situation

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
These sorts of things we expect to hear around the holidays, around the launch

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
But we're not talking the launch period

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
This is like two years into the system's life now

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Dark Sakura, what's your thoughts?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Animal Crossing

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
What is it about Animal Crossing?

10:59.000 --> 11:08.000
Well, and I'm looking at it sort of as my two years of psychology before I changed my major type stuff

11:08.000 --> 11:14.000
The issue is that right now a lot of stuff is out of control, right?

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
We don't have a lot of active control over what we can do in our lives

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
We can't go out, we can't do things

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
We can't see the people that we want to see

11:25.000 --> 11:31.000
But Animal Crossing has been this way to remotely visit people

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
I mean, for me, I've been hanging out with my friend Gwen practically every day

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
We were college roommates and haven't seen each other since a couple of years since I moved out here

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
But we chat every day

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
She used to be in our WoW guild for a while

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
You remember? She's actually on Final Fantasy XIV right now

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Yeah, I know she is, yeah

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
So anyway, I've been playing with Tiara

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
They've been really good company

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
I can do stuff in my town

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
It's something that I have a more active control over

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
Something that I am doing, something that's giving me that immediate reward

12:10.000 --> 12:16.000
And on top of that, now some people have been absolutely cutthroat with the game

12:16.000 --> 12:22.000
But it's been a lot of people cooperating with each other

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
It's taking that stuff that we're trying to encourage people to do in real life

12:27.000 --> 12:34.000
But we have this controllable environment that kind of does let us be in the presence of other people to interact

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
Yeah, that's a very interesting take

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
And I like that, the fact that even though in this situation you can't control things

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
In Animal Crossing, relatively, you have control over things

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
I mean, maybe not everything

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
The other day, Rocket threatened to move out of my town

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
And I basically said she's not allowed to do that

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
And if she leaves, I'm going to burn down the town

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
But she didn't, so I'm very happy about that

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
Because Rocket and Ketchup are my two favorite villagers, just for the record

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
I especially love Ketchup, I will die for Ketchup

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Octavian is pissing me off because I invited him for a second time

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
Because he's my favorite grumpy old man octopus

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
So now I have to invite him a third time to try to convince him

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
I gave up on Dina

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
Dina, I think, has moved on to other levels of her lesbianism

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
I'll tell you what, Brad, Pod Culture and Chats says, how do we send Ed to Jamie?

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
You shut your whore mouth, okay?

13:29.000 --> 13:37.000
As the island turns, like bells through the hourglass, these are the days of our horizons

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
But you know what I did find amongst my amiibo cards?

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
I found Julian

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Yeah, no, you had a crap ton of those amiibo cards

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
And I have the actual figurines

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
Do you know what I actually have that now apparently is really valuable?

13:51.000 --> 14:00.000
I have a sealed copy of Wii U Animal Crossing with the Isabelle amiibo and the other guy in it, still, sealed

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
Oh, what you mean the amiibo festival?

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
The little dog, yeah, amiibo festival, that's it

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
Those are going for like hundreds of dollars on eBay

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
I have the game, although I've played it because I actually think it's legit fun

14:13.000 --> 14:18.000
Yeah, no, I never opened it and I was thinking about opening it the other day

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
Because this is the hilarious part, Alan got it for like 10 bucks on a Target clearance

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
Because that was one of the last games in the heyday of the Wii U

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
So that was kind of on its way out the door

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
And now everybody wants their hands on those amiibo

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
And Wii U games in general are becoming collector's items

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
I don't know, I don't know if I want to keep it, sell it, what do I want to do? It's tough

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
Well, I'll tell you what, nothing has financial value until you try to sell it

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
I guess that's true

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
Anyway, I want to get some of the comments from our chat room over at Twitch

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
And then good fucking luck

14:49.000 --> 14:54.000
Over at twitch.tv slash vog network because a lot of folks have some comments on this

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
So Mel Chan in our chat says

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
I have mine but I've been trying to find one for my client to keep her busy

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
I'm assuming this is a switch

15:03.000 --> 15:09.000
Between tons of families suddenly stuck at home and the biggest game for it in a long time happening simultaneously

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
It just added to it

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
Let's see, Fifth Dream Today says

15:12.000 --> 15:17.000
Someone I know from the Goth community I'm in and barely knew since Animal Crossing New Horizons came out

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
We've been talking and trading and having conversations about other things

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
Well, you know, sometimes video games really do bring us together

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
And for me it's always been about MMOs

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
Like some of my closest friendships were formed because of MMOs

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
And being able to play MMOs online with people

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
I mean, hell, even like Loki and I before we lived together we were playing Final Fantasy XI a lot online

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
So, you know, a lot of times video games can definitely bring us together

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
And although I wouldn't call Animal Crossing New Horizons an MMO per se

15:45.000 --> 15:52.000
There definitely is an important multiplayer component about it, for sure

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
YYR says it was definitely the Animal Crossing New Horizons release above all

15:56.000 --> 16:02.000
Also, despite Nintendo's selection of multiplayer games, you need multiple systems to really take advantage

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
So a lot of thoughts there on the Nintendo Switch shortage

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
And then when it comes to Ring Fit Adventure, SHG100Matt says

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
I've been playing a ton of Ring Fit Adventure

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
It's the best thing to keep me active without going outside

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Which I do at midnight when no one is around

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
But Ring Fit Adventure offers a great workout

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
And yeah, I think that game in particular

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
You know, that game was getting kind of hard to find anyway

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
And you hit the nail on the head

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
Like some people, like I do go outdoors once in a while

16:31.000 --> 16:36.000
And I go to parks and I still play my GPS games like Orna and Ingress and stuff

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
But I find that I'm going to the same parks and the same places

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
And it's getting a little dry for me

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
So Ring Fit Adventure is something a little bit kind of like different I think

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
You know, you're working your way, it's digitally different but it's still something different

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
And then of course they added that music game mode

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Right after the last direct

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
That kind of added something to it as well

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
So I think Ring Fit Adventure feels a lot different than taking a walk around that same neighborhood park

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
You've taken a trip around many, many times before

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
So yeah, SHG100Matt says

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
Folks can't go to the gym, Ring Fit offers a great alternative

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Loki, let me go to you

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
What do you think is the Switch fever?

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
What is it that's making everybody crave one of these right now?

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
Because they can't have it so then they want it

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
I don't know, I think it's just

17:23.000 --> 17:28.000
It's popular, I don't see Animal Crossing as a system seller but

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I don't know

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
I really would think it would be a different game or something like that

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
But I don't know

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
I don't know what the

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
I think people finding maybe more time to play games now

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
And so they decided that they want to get Switch

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
Maybe we're hearing more about the Switch because

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
Xbox and Playstation 4 are so easy to get

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
And I would normally agree with you that

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
Animal Crossing I would not have thought would have been a game that would be a system seller

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
In any other, that doesn't mean it's a bad game

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
I just wouldn't have seen it as something that moved

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
I mean there's always going to be the hardcore fans

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
But I would have seen it as something that moved a lot of systems in any other circumstance

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
But in this particular world circumstance now I'm like

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Oh it kind of is though

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
Yeah and I don't even know necessarily it's just because Animal Crossing came

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
I mean I think it's just the timing in general

18:18.000 --> 18:23.000
And I think it's because Nintendo has historically had a poor

18:23.000 --> 18:29.000
They've done a poor job at fulfilling orders for their systems

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
And yeah I know they're blaming it on the COVID stuff now

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
But let's be honest I mean they're going to blame it on everything

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
I just don't

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
It'd be interesting to see like the actual numbers of how many systems have been sold

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
I mean I know Nintendo does well and I'm not just going to say that

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
I don't think it's dramatically different

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
I just think that because now everybody's

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
The demand has gone up that now they're having supply issues again

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Whereas I'm not sure

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
I assume that the demand's gone up across the board for all systems

18:59.000 --> 19:04.000
But I think that they're able to handle their supply a little bit better maybe

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
I don't know

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
But I'd be curious to see how the other systems fare as well

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
Yeah I think Animal Crossing 2 is very different from a Zelda

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
Very different from a Mario Party or Mario Kart

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
That's already on the Switch

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
Because I think Animal Crossing is a game where you know

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
As Dark Sakura was kind of explaining with her old roommate

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
You can kind of get together and do things in a space

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
Whereas you know that's not really what you're doing in Mario Kart

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
I mean yes you can play that game online with friends or Splatoon even

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
I mean that doesn't make those games bad at all

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
They're great for what they are

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
But they're not like existing in the same space

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
And building this space together that's almost like

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
Fulfilling this need that many of us are not getting in the real world right now

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
It's something very specific about that game

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
In many ways Nintendo could not have timed it any better

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
And I know that sounds like a really crass thing to say

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
And nobody would have ever wished this situation on anything

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
But it's just how the pieces fell for this particular game and this circumstance

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
And it's really worked out in this game's favor

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
It is what it is

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
I sound like a horrible person when I'm saying it that way

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
But that's just the reality

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
You don't sound horrible at all though

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
That sounds absolutely accurate

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
I mean not that they purposefully timed it like this

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
But the timing was perfect

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
No one knew that there was going to be a pandemic

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
But the fact that this came out just at the right time

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
Has been a godsend for a lot of people's sanity

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
Yeah in many ways

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
And it's interesting as Bobby points out

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
They did delay it

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
It was a November game last year

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
And in many ways

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
I can't believe here we are now saying this

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
But thank god they delayed it

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Right?

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
And I'm hoping

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
I know that there's another company that's hoping

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
To get the same kind of fire lit under their game

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Because it's come out a while ago

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
And hasn't done very well

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
But now they're releasing it on Steam

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
And that's Fallout 76

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
It's finally coming to Steam

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
But

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
It's Fallout 76

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Yeah

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Number one it's Fallout 76

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
And I feel like most people have already made their judgement on that

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
I mean good luck to them

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Well they have the Wastelanders expansion

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
And not to say they can never be good at some point

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
It's just

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
I'm gonna send my thoughts and prayers to Fallout 76

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
But the reality is

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
What it doesn't have that Animal Crossing has

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
I think is a sense of accessibility

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
And by that I mean like

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Kids play Animal Crossing

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
It's very easy for adults

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
We have the famous grandma that plays Animal Crossing

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
And it's not that these folks can't play Fallout 76

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
Although I don't know if you know with the violence in that game

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
It may be appropriate for audiences

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
But it's just something about the accessibility

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Of an Animal Crossing game versus a Fallout 76

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Where it's like

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Fallout 76 you'll never be glamour

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Like you'll never be glamour Fallout

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
You never will

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Animal Crossing has

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
That it factor

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
That X factor

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
That accessibility

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
That universal appeal thing

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
That like

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
I'm sorry Bethesda

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
But Fallout 76 doesn't have it

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Now for a certain audience

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
And a certain group

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
And certain people

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
That will you know turn their nose up at Animal Crossing

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
And yes Fallout 76 will play to that audience

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
But the reality is it's not as big of an audience

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
So there's

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Yeah I figured as much yeah

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Yeah

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
Well and I've got Dan back into playing Animal Crossing

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Which he had no interest in since

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
You know the GameCube one

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
Where you had all your NES games in there

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
And he and I have been

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
I've been though

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
Whoring him out to you know pay off all of my

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
You know bridges and inclines and stuff

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
By making his own tarantula island

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
But for him I think he's

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Found some things in it very therapeutic

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
So it's brought people back into that

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
That fandom too

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
And the fan art community has been a delight

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
I am all about the stock market

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
I am all about

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Stonks

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
The stonks

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Turnips

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
I heard you like turnips

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Because I am that person that like

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
I have a little group chat with like

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Shane and some of the other people

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I play Fallout SE 14

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
And like just before noon in the AM

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
I have this picture of Tom Nook holding a gun

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
It's like it's the gun meme where somebody's holding a gun to the camera

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
And it's Tom Nook holding a gun

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
It says give me your turnip prices

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
Because I'm trying to find where I can sell those turnips

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
And right now I have a turnip room in my house

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
And it's only barely enough to hold all the turnips right now

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
So everybody kind of has their different way of playing

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
I don't like to do the tarantula game

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
But everybody has their different way of doing it

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
For me it's all about turnips

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
About turnips for one reason

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
To get ants

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Because that's how you get ants is you have to leave your turnips out

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
And the ants are cute

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
But then Dan took my ants and I went back and the ants were gone

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
And I was so mad

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
And Sia Tabiri says

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
I finally got into turnips this morning

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
Yeah and that's

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
I love like talking to people going to the different groups

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
What's your turnips, what's your turnips, what's your

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Hey I heard you like turnips

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
But what I don't like

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
And I'm gonna be downright honest

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
What I don't care for is like

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
I read this article about how somebody set up

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
A security team on their island

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
That would block the door to nooks

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Until you like left a tip

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
That you'd I guess promise to give

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
All this like crazy stuff

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
And I'm like that ain't it

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
For me I mean if that's how you want to play

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Hey it's your game do what you like

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
But for me like I don't believe in tipping

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
In Animal Crossing

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
In the real world completely different

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
But in Animal Crossing no no no

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
It's about the exchange of

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
You know you scratch my back I'll scratch yours

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
And I had

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
And this person has friends

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
What society should be like in Animal Crossing

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
You know what Bernie Sanders

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Bernie Sanders ran on a turnip platform

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
And look what happened

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Alright anyway

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
But I will say this

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
You know I've started a Facebook Animal Crossing group

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
That grew much bigger than I thought it was gonna be

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
But everybody there

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
I have to give them credit

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Everyone there has been a delight

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
Everyone has put out public codes for everyone

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
And these are the kind of people that I like to play with

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
And I encourage everyone just to be

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
You know don't make it a burden for other people

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Help each other out you know

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
And then play that into real life please

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
We need it

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Yeah for sure

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Yeah and like when my turnips were going for 90

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
Like they were selling last week at 90

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
I was just like yeah open up come visit

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Cause then I was like yay people will visit

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
And if they write on my board

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Or they talk to my villagers

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
And that's reward enough for me

25:40.000 --> 25:45.000
So but I understand some people have a more capitalistic approach

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
To things

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Gosh maybe I was a democratic socialist this whole time

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
And didn't realize I don't know

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
I'll throw something out there too Rob

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Because you know and not

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
People I guess just don't actually realize this

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
But if you've held something in your inventory

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
You can order it later as long as it was a DIY

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
So that's what Gwen and I have been doing every day

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
Is that we'll find something we're not sure if the other person has

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
And we order each other our music

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Well I did that for you

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
You needed the meme shirt

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Yeah we did

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
Yeah so I sent you the meme shirt

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
And then I immediately took it over to Gwen

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
So she could put it in her inventory for five seconds

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
And I could get it back

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
I'm all about that that's cool

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
And so that way we've been you know

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
If someone wants something

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
Yeah maybe you can't pay the 64,000 bells for an arcade machine

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
But you can hold it for five seconds

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
And save up for one for yourself

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
But I will say this and I think we're starting to bleed into our

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Video game weeks a little bit

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
So I'll advance the ticket over here

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
But I will say this much

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
As far as like all that stuff goes

26:42.000 --> 26:48.000
Is that I don't really open my island to everybody

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
Because and I think one of the big drawbacks about Animal Crossing is

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
Surprise surprise Nintendo's mediocre online system

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
Because it takes like freaking two minutes

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
For somebody to get to your island

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
And another two minutes for them to leave

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
And that can be like let's imagine

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
Just imagine my turnips are selling for 530

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
One day just imagine

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
And I go to Twitter and I write

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Hey my island's open

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
My turnips are 530

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
People are never gonna get in

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Because every 30 seconds

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Bing bing bing

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
Please close the window

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
A person's trying to connect

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
And it would just be crazy

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
That's why I only open my island with dodo codes

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
So that I know who's coming

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
I have it controlled to a certain number

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
And then like I don't have to worry about that

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Connecting and disconnecting message every 30 seconds

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
It is the most annoying thing they need to fix

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Big time

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat talking about his experience with Animal Crossing

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Saying the fun part with me

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Is that my wife is playing more than I do

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
And we have one physical cart

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
So we can't play at the same time

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
She's unemployed so she's playing a lot

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
And I get like an hour or two a night before my shop's closed

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Well we all play at our different pace

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Like Dark Soccer came to visit me this week

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
At Animal Crossing

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
And she's like, where's your Able Sisters?

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
And I'm like, don't have it

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
I've been doing things at my pace

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
I'm like, I think I still need to build somebody a home

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
I don't know

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
And she was like, oh

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
My kids use it for Minecraft

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
And so I never get it

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
Yeah but it's just, I've been playing 14 and near

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
And 7 Remake and other stuff I'll talk about shortly

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
So it's like, I've just been playing Animal Crossing at my own pace

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
And like I said, I'm all about the turnips

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
I want to have my basement

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Because if Dark Soccer isn't going to have a shrine to fire

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Then I will, in my basement

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
No, I have my bonfire

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Once I finish getting my townhouse planned up

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
I'm going to be, well I've got my Stonehenge right?

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
And I'm going to put fire all around my Stonehenge

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
With my cherry trees in the background

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
And we also don't have any bridges or anything leading to it

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
So my animals can't go, you know, mess it up

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
So, yeah

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
And I have Baphomet Point, don't forget about that

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Where my lighthouse is

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
That's right

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
You know, and to be fair

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
I also kind of want like a

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
I don't know if I want to say a sex dungeon in the basement

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
But like a pervert dungeon

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
I think is what I want in the basement of my house

29:12.000 --> 29:16.000
So, you know, I'll be thinking about that

29:16.000 --> 29:21.000
Because I'm that sicko that likes to do things you really shouldn't do in cutesy games

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
What can I say?

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Should I order you the bondage outfit then that they have in the game?

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Oh, do they have one? Yes

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Because today I got that

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
I got that human skeleton that like you could

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
It's like the anatomy thing

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
Yeah

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Yeah, I thought that would be funny

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Do you need like the actual skeleton?

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
You know, if you poke at it, it raises its arms like it's trying to scare you

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Oh yeah, I knew one of those, send me one of those

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
Okay, I can order tomorrow, so yeah

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
We'll talk about that later, but I'll send you the bondage outfit too

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Let's talk about the rest of our gaming weeks

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
I mean, clearly Animal Crossing has played a big part in our weeks

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Just like everybody else's

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
DarkSakura, would you care to continue?

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
How was your gaming week? Animal Crossing or otherwise?

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Animal Crossing

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
All the Animal Crossing

30:02.000 --> 30:07.000
And actually, my lungs have been doing a lot better

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
Yay

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
So I've actually considered getting Yoga Master for the Switch

30:12.000 --> 30:18.000
Just to give myself a little bit more motivation to get up and do my morning yoga

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
So, you know, I'm not all stiff and terrible

30:20.000 --> 30:25.000
And hopefully do that to, you know, get my breathing back where it was

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
You know, like I said, it's better

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
But I moved like three bags of dirt that I got at Target

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Because, you know, I'm planting my apocalypse garden

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
And, oh, I was a mess right after that

30:36.000 --> 30:41.000
So yeah, I'm hoping that having like a yoga game on my Switch

30:41.000 --> 30:46.000
Will, you know, help me get back into doing my breathing exercises and all that

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
Kind of sounds like it's trying to hit on that Wii Fit market

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
That doesn't totally exist on the Switch right now

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Although, I mean, there's Ring Fit certainly

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
But Ring Fit doesn't really have a yoga in it

30:55.000 --> 31:00.000
So, which was probably the most popular and well-known element of Wii Fit

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
If we got a Wii Fit, though, that would be absolutely amazing

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
Because I think I would play the hell out of it

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
You know, again, just because of not being able to get up

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
You know, I've got free weights in the house that I could be using

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
But while I'm healing up and my lungs aren't as strong

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
Doing yoga and certainly, you know, doing it in a game

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
Would probably be easier and more enjoyable

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Alright, anything else with your gaming week?

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
I, no

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Alright, then we'll go to Loki

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
How was your gaming week?

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
So, this week I didn't play a ton of things

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
I did end up playing some Final Fantasy VII Remake

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
So, I'm not very far in it

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
I'm about just an hour and a half or so into it

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
So, I think just in the middle of Chapter 2

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
And I'm liking it so far

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
I think it's pretty amazing

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Just an incredible looking game

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
And I remember Nelly was going

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Like, is this a game?

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
She's like, it looks so real

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
But yeah, it was fun

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
I tried to get my kids to watch because I thought it'd be interesting for them to watch

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
But they only had the attention span for like five minutes

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
But, what else?

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
I also played a little bit more Beat Saber

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
I did a little bit of Step Mania

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
I've been going through my song list

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
And trying to pare down some of the songs I have on there

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
And try to remove duplicates that I have in folders

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Because I just dumped a whole bunch of collections together

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
So, I've been going through that

32:33.000 --> 32:37.000
And also, I repaired my Nintendo Switch this week

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
So, I had Drift on the two Joy-Cons

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
So, I actually got the parts from iFixit

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
And took them apart

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
The Joy-Cons replaced the analog sticks in them

32:48.000 --> 32:54.000
And then I was having an issue where I kept saying my SD card was being removed from the system

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
Even though it wasn't

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
So, I took the system apart

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
And the way they engineered that thing is so stupid

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
It's literally being held in by a little bit of foam

33:06.000 --> 33:13.000
And the tension from the actual back of the device is pushing this connection down

33:13.000 --> 33:17.000
And so, it can come loose if your child then drops it on the ground

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
So, literally all I had to do was push it back in the connector

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
And then everything was fine

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
But the fact that it's not like held in

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
It's not like a ribbon cable or something that's attached in there

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
It's just like this little thing that's held on by pressure

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
It's absolutely stupid

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
At least I know if it ever breaks it's easier to replace

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
So, I did all that this week

33:40.000 --> 33:46.000
And then I've been just kind of getting my laptop still set up for gaming and stuff

33:46.000 --> 33:51.000
I got an external drive reader for my 5TB drive from my old laptop

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
I tried fixing my old one but I think it's shot

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
And then I got a brand new 2TB one

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
So, I got like 8TB of storage on my PC now

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
It's great

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
I'm putting tons of games on there

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
So, that's been my week

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Okay, awesome

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
Well, enjoy filling up the 8TB drive with games you'll never play

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
Absolutely

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Okay

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
My gaming week

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
Let's talk about Final Fantasy VII Remake

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Because I'm also playing it

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
And I'm on chapter 6

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
We have it on order by the way

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
Well, here's the thing

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
So, I was supposed to get it on Tuesday

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Because Amazon's running behind

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
I get a lot of my stuff from Amazon

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
And they're running a little behind

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
And I really was okay with it

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
But then when everybody was getting the hype going on Twitter

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
And all that stuff

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
And I was thinking about

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
I don't really have a lot to do this weekend

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
I was like, you know what?

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Fuck it

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
I'm just gonna buy it digital

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Even though, yeah

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
So, I did it

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
I hit the button and I bought digital

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
And I'm actually kind of glad I did

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
Because it's been able to fill quite a bit of time this weekend

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Maybe about like 7 hours in

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
I don't know

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
I'd probably play more if I had a better attention span

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
But I'm very much like

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
I sit in front of the TV for an hour

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Then I need to go sit in front of the computer for an hour

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
And then maybe I need to go like

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
Go in the backyard for just a little bit

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
To get some fresh air or something

35:08.000 --> 35:12.000
Like, I can't really just keep staying in one place

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
For hours and hours and hours

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Like I used to be able to

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
When the original Final Fantasy VII came out

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
But anyway, I have played through a good chunk of the game at this point

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
I mean, I don't know how many chapters there are

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
But I'm up to chapter 6

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Obviously, I'm not gonna spoil anything

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Let's talk about that to begin with

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
Because you might think

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Well, Rob, how can you spoil things

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Because this is just a remake of Final Fantasy VII

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
So it's the same plot, right?

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
Wrong

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
There are a lot of things

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
That people are getting very wrong about this game

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
And I'm going right for it

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
One of them

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
That you guys are getting really wrong

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
And when I say like you guys

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
I mean like Twitter

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
And some of the, you know, hot takes, trademarks

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
So forth about the game

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Is the hot take that I see

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
I do not want to buy that game

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
Because it's only 10% of the story

35:57.000 --> 36:02.000
You are completely going about that assessment the wrong way

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Period

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
It is not a one for one remake

36:06.000 --> 36:10.000
You're thinking probably of a remaster

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
You're thinking of that game that you wanted

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
When you saw that PlayStation 3 demo

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
That rendered the opening sequence of the game in high definition

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
All those years ago

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
That first led people to talking about

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
They wanted a Final Fantasy VII in HD

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Let me be clear

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
This is not that game

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
This is a different game

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
And I think maybe part of the problem

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Is that they called it Final Fantasy VII Remake

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Because this is Final Fantasy Reimagined

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
This is Final Fantasy VII Reinvention

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
This is

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
They took the plot and they took the characters

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
And they made a brand new game out

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
They made Final Fantasy XVI out of it

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
Is what they did

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
This is what should have been

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
Well in a way

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
But you couldn't do this game on the PlayStation

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Full stop

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
As long as that bitch dies

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
As long as there are guys I'm happy

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
Well and who knows

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
And I don't think that part would be covered in this game

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
But I really feel like anything goes with the plot

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
I have her

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Obviously I want this to be a spoiler free place

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
I have heard the ending is shocking

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Which it shouldn't be shocking

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
If you've played through the original

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
So apparently they've done something

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
But it wouldn't surprise me

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
Because they have done all this different stuff along the way

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
One of the things is that they have completely fleshed out these characters

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Who were very much

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
I don't want to say throwaway sidekicks

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
But they were just

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
They were not really a part of the story before

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
I'm speaking mainly of Jesse, Biggs, and Wedge

37:34.000 --> 37:39.000
Who are completely fleshed out full characters

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
They're not playable

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
But I'll be damned if you're going to tell me they're not a part of the story

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Because they very much are in this game

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
And you know

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
Again this is not a one for one of the original Final Fantasy VII

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
What this is

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Think of it more like this

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
And I can't think of a better comparison

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Maybe you guys can

37:57.000 --> 38:01.000
Final Fantasy VII is like Buffy the Vampire Slayer the movie

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
A nice two hour movie

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Stands on its own

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
There's things people appreciate about it

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
Everybody loves that sequence with Pee Wee Herman as the vampire

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
There's Buffy the Vampire Slayer the movie

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Then years later

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
There's Buffy the Vampire Slayer the TV show

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
It goes on for seven seasons

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
You know what it's the same character

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
And some of the themes they explore are the exact same thing

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
But it's very very different

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
That is Final Fantasy VII Remake

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
I don't know what do you guys think

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Is that a fair comparison?

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Anyone?

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
I haven't watched the Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Now you spoil it for me

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
You need to fix that

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
I can see that

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
I can see that except

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
No cause

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
I don't know

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Maybe not directly that

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
Because yeah the plot of the movie doesn't really go over to the TV show

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
But I couldn't really think of a movie

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
The only other thing I can think of is that The Shining was a movie

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
And then they had the mini series

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
With Rebecca De Mornay and some other guy

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
What about more like V?

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Oh that's a good one

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
We had V the mini series

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
And then it tried to flesh it out

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
I'm gonna tell you the TV series kind of jumped the shark a bit later

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
But I can kind of see what the TV series was trying to do

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Oh MASH

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Good one Pod Culture

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
I don't know if as many people know about

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
I hate to say it but know about MASH

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
Let's be real

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
The 20 year olds may not

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
May not have familiarity with MASH

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Like those of us in our 40's

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
When the reruns were on all day long

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
But MASH is a good

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
If you know MASH that's an excellent example actually

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
So anyway

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
I think you all kind of get what I'm saying

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Game Spots Review had the best line

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
For returning fans this isn't the Final Fantasy 7 your mind remembers

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
It's the one your heart always knew it to be

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Tigerclaw says

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Is the story in the Final Fantasy 7 remake

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Verbatim from the original

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
All the same story beats and stuff that made the original impactful

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
No

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
And I'll leave it at that

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
So

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Tigerclaw says

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Remakes often do things different from the original

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Stuff like origins of characters being different

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
The fate of certain characters being different

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
It's how they differentiate from the original

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
And I will say

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
And again I don't want to spoil

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Because I want to be very

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
You know very aware that maybe not everybody

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Some of you probably ordered from Amazon

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Haven't got the game yet

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
But if you've played the demo

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Which is available out there for everybody

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
You'll notice that the end of the demo

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Is something very very explicit

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
That was only

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Implied in the original game

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
And wasn't necessarily

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Explicitly stated

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
The way it was very clearly done

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
At the end of the demo

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
For those that have played it you'll know exactly what I'm talking about

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
For those that haven't, well maybe that will make you interested

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
I don't know

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
But I kind of think playing that demo will give you a good sense

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Of the types of changes they can make to the game

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
For one it will give you a feeling of the combat

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Which the combat is

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Very different and not everybody's going to love it

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Again

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
I know a lot of people are like

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Oh there's a classic mode

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
It's really nothing like the original battle system

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
I'm sorry to say

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
I don't know I kind of think it's fun

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
I like the new battle system

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
I'm playing it on easy, granted

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Because I really wanted to focus on the story

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
And I kind of felt okay I'll do one play through on easy

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
And in the back of my mind I'm going

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
This game's going to come out on Playstation 5

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Oh that was the other reason I went digital

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
At the end of the day

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
I went digital because my thought was

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
If Playstation 5 will play Playstation 4 games

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Then hypothetically

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Fingers crossed, toes crossed

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
We don't know this for sure

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
But I'm hoping Sony does the right thing

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
And that means your digital library on Playstation 4

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Will instantly unlock on Playstation 5

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Probably

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
That's my hope anyway

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
I hope Sony gets that right

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
So my thought is

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
I'm going to play through it on easy now

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
And if I have to replay it on Playstation 5

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
I'll play it on either normal or hard then

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
So that's kind of my other thought

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Process that went to that

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
But I think the battle mode is

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Kind of fun

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
It's like an improved version of 15

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
To me

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
And I know that might make a lot of people wince

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Because I know 15's battle system wasn't popular

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
But that's why I say improved version of 15

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
To me

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
I feel like there's more point to some of the buttons that you're mashing

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
And it doesn't have all that crazy teleporting stuff

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
That is weird

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
That is not there

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
But I really like how when you do pause the battle to use fire

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
To use magic

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
It's really cool how everything moves in bullet time slow motion

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
And that just adds to the flair

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
This game has

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
This game has so much flair

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
And I talked about this with the demo

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
And there was a part of me that was like

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
I don't know how they can keep that going

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Throughout the game

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
And there are some slower parts

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Like there are some side quests that you do

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
That maybe don't have quite the flair

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
That the opening of the game does

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
It definitely fills in some of the back story

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
It makes, again, characters that were

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Throwaway side characters in the original game

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Have full on

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Plot devices

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
In this game

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
And so forth, so there's that

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
But I would say maybe the game

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Didn't have quite that intense flair

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Moving through those side quests

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
And so forth, but I'm pretty impressed

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
When you're going through the main story

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
There's an energy that this game

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Just doesn't stop

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
And I'll tell you

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
This shouldn't be a spoiler because this is a very well known

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Sequence in the original game

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
The motorcycle sequence

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
It is reimagined and it's in this game

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
And it's another one of those

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
They do something kind of different to it

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Where it's like, holy shit

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
This doesn't fucking stop

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
It's awesome

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
And again, if you've played it, you know what I'm talking about

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
If you haven't

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Maybe in a few more months I'll feel a little

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
More at ease talking about some of these spoilers

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Openly, but yeah

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
It's got a certain energy level that doesn't stop

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
And the graphics and the

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Sound and music

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
They just, like Loki said

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
His wife thought it was a movie

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Right? I mean, it just

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
With the camera tricks that it plays

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
It just feels like you're really playing a movie

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
It's fantastic

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
So

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Fifth Dream Today in chat says

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Biggs is Charlie Sheen

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Circa 1986

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Okay, but Charlie Sheen never

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Had a voice as silky smooth

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
As Gideon Emery, who really adds

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Everything to that character

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
It's so weird hearing him

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Without a British

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Accent

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
And I read a review on the game that said they

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Couldn't unhear Balthier

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
And I'm like, I don't

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
If I really try to make myself hear that, I will

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
But, or Orangé in Final Fantasy 14

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Uh-uh, uh-uh

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
You know what's always for me?

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
It's Dragon Age 2

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Of course

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
I always hear Fenris

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
And if you really want to hear that, you will

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
But I'm able to kind of let Biggs be

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
His own character, so it's pretty cool

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
He's cute

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Yeah, and you know

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Barret Jesse

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Barret in the demo

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Definitely has that

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Same kind of hard edge

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Hard ass Barret, but I think once you get past

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
The demo sequence

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
You start to see Barret's softer side

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
About why, I mean, especially when his daughter

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Is introduced for the first time, which again, that was in the original game

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
And there, obviously

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
That element that Barret has

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
A daughter, is still in this remake

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
And you know, you start to see kind of like

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
More of the why is he doing what he's doing

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
And so forth, I think they really kind of start to

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Develop him a lot

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Better than just like

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
The Mr. T clone he was in the

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Original game, they really kind of like

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Flesh him out a lot more

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
And especially some of the support, like

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
I will admit, I was never really on

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
The Tifa bandwagon in the original game

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
But I really

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Like her in this

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
I really, really like what they have done with her character

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Because she's

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
She's a strong, bad ass

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Fucking woman

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
And she's great in this game

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
And then they really fleshed out

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Jesse, Biggs, and Wedge to be

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Their own characters

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Jesse's a little

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
I don't know, I have mixed feelings on Jesse

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
But I think she means well

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
I just don't like boob armor

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Yeah, yeah

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
But yeah

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
I just like

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
I could go on and on and probably talk for three hours

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
About just this game, but I'm really enjoying it

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
And I think this game is

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Absolutely going to come up

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
When we talk about end of the year lists

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
The one other thing I wanted to say about it

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Is that everybody's talking about

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
What's going to be Final Fantasy 7 Remake

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Episode 2, or what's going to

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
What's going to happen there

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
There's a weird part of me

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
That wonders if there's necessarily

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Going to be one

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
I feel like they're going to do it just to

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Kind of cash in on it and to get the money for it

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
But a game like that's going to take a long time to develop

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
And if this game truly stands

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
On its own, which I fully

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Believe it will

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Will they need to do a second game?

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Well, I think it will take less time

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Because now that they have the engine

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
It's more just

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Creating the assets for it

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
All the recordings and everything

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Whereas a lot of the time

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
From the initial development of this game

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Was developing the engine

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
It would run and all that

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
So now that they have the tech in place

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
I think making more content for it is not going to be that difficult

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
You mean it's not just running in 15's engine?

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Because I think it's running in 15's engine

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
I think it's different in 15

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
One other thing too

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Because I like to spoil things for myself

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Before other people do it

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
There's going to be another

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Ok, so that tells me

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
They left the door open for more

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
At the point where it ends there must be more

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Because that's only scratching the surface of the story

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Ok, interesting

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Alright, well we'll see what happens

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
And maybe it is going to be something where

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Final Fantasy 13 had 13-2

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Lightning Returns

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
What are they going to call it? Final Fantasy 7 Remake 2

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
I guess it will have to be the name of it

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
I don't know what they're going to call it

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
This will be very interesting

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Chapter 2 Part 2

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Chapter 2 is probably a better name for it

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
But we'll see

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Except aren't all the in-game things chapters themselves

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
So maybe it would be

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
We have volume 1 because then you have your chapters

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Of your one book

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
And you have volume 2 which is

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Tigerclaw in chat says

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Rob, now that you've played the remake

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
How would you rate it?

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Is it better than the original?

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
I'm not fully comfortable answering that question

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Until I actually beat the game so I can have

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Had the full experience of both games

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
But as it stands now

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
I'm going to find it very

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Difficult to compare the two

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Because I think the Final Fantasy 7

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Original game was

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
An amazing game for

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Its time

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
But now this remake is showing us

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
There's so much more

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
There's going to be all these people that complain that

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Final Fantasy 7 was just really a mediocre

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Game and didn't really stand the test of time

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Here's everything this game

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Could have been

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Is almost I feel like the game I'm

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Playing now or here if I could go back

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
And do it over here's what I do

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Differently I almost feel like

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Is the game I'm playing now and so it's

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
It's almost like apples to oranges

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
A little bit or maybe not like apples to oranges

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
But like apples to applesauce

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Like I don't

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
It's just I don't know if I'm ever going to be comfortable

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Answering that question because Final Fantasy 7

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Is great for its time

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
And it's even a game

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
That I would recommend as an RPG classic

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Today but the remake is just

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Different I don't know if I would say play

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
This or that I would say play this

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
And that can we rewind

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
To 20 year old Jamie for a moment

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Please who did not own

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
A Playstation yet owned a copy of Final

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Fantasy 7

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Playing it on her roommate's Playstation

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
And you know

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
The whole Knights of the Round quadramagic

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Blah blah blah making a sandwich you know

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
But I had

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Three and a quarter discs and I had

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
A box full of them that was nothing but

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Vincent fan art

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Because reasons

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
I played I've beaten that

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Game so many times I still

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Have a working save file

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Where Aerith gets you know

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Skewered which is beautiful

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
And then it goes right into the Jenova fight which is one of my

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Favorite pieces of music in the game too

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
And you know

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
It's

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
This was like my thing

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
This was one of my

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
It's been a while I go through

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Phrases where I'll get something that's like my huge ass

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Fandom this was my Mass Effect

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Back then

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
And I am super excited

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
To play this one or to

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
You know have me and Dan play it together

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
You know do our take turn things whenever we do

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
But

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
I think I'm going to love this

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
As much as I love the original because

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
I love the characters so much I love the story

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
So much and for me

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
I

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
I'm looking forward to drawing my own comparisons

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
But I don't think I think they're each going to

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Stand alone as their own just from the impression I've been

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Getting from everybody agree and I think

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
I think also at a very important point about

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
This remake there's a lot that

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Could have gone wrong with this remake

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
They could have easily fucked this game

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Up easily

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
They didn't and I think that deserves

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Applause

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
At least the parts that I've played they didn't

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
There's very there's even even if they completely

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Decide to take the story in a 180 or whatever

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
There's very little that's going to make me

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Change my mind on that I think they

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
There's a lot that could have gone wrong and it really does

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Seem like it didn't and they've done a very good job

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
And it's interesting because now it has a lot of people

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Talking about what about Final Fantasy 8

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Are they going to do a remake of Final Fantasy 8

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
And there's a part of me that's like

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
No we don't need to go back and remake

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
All the old Playstation games

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Like make a Final Fantasy 16

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Already but there's also

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
A part of me that's like you know what

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
And I've taken a lot of shit on the show for this opinion

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
But it's my opinion dammit

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Final Fantasy 8 is my least favorite

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
Final Fantasy game save the original

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Version of Final Fantasy 14 which was

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Which was hot garbage

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Final Fantasy 8 is my least

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
It's my least

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
See I disagree but that's okay everybody's got their own rankings

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Final Fantasy 8 is my least favorite and it's because

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
It's not because of the story so for those of you

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
That want to fight me on the story it's not

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
That's not the reason I find Final Fantasy 8

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Unplayable because of

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
The junction draw

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
And that whole battle system

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
How the monsters level up with you

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Which was the worst part of Final Fantasy 2

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
And just everything in that battle mechanics

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Everything in that system sucks

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
And I hate it and I can't

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Play the game because of it but now

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
I'm thinking well wait a minute

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
If they go back and do Final Fantasy 8

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Then they get to keep what's good

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
The story and they get to redo

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
What's not good the battle system

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
So from that perspective

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Bring it on you know what

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
This Final Fantasy 8 hater says

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
I would like to see that actually

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Yes remake 8 do it

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Because maybe that's actually gonna help

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
In a lot of ways with some of my own

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Issues about Final Fantasy 8 so

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Anyway and yes I

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Realize so many people

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Have their opinions on Final Fantasy 8

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
And that's fine

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
S2100 Matt in chat says

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
This is a perfect example of

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
People will forget the endless delay

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
If the game is done well

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Poorly done delayed games become the butt

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Of jokes forever

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Kudos to that remark and this game

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Again with all the

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Flare and the strong art direction

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
In this game and just how this

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Game dances as you play it

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
You see where five years worth of

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Work went into this game

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
You see it

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
This game clearly took a long time to make

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Anyway again I can talk for three

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Hours about the Final Fantasy 7 remake but I should probably

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Move on with other headlines

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Other games I've played this week I've continued on Final Fantasy 14

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
My Dancer hit level 80

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
And I did play more Nier Automata

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Until the 7 remake came out

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
And I actually got as far as

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
I got past that amusement park

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Level and I got to do the boss at the end of the

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Amusement park again I'm trying to not

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
Super spoil although that game's been out a little bit

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Longer but that was a real

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
For me that was a really hard boss

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
At the end of that so

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
That game is very challenging

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
But again I talked highly about

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
That game last week I love the kind of like

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Hybrid shooter slash action

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Game that Nier gives

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Y'all were right on Nier

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
I said it on Twitter I'll say it again

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
I missed out so I

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Should go back and I will

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Go back and finish Nier once I'm done

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
With Final Fantasy 7 remake

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
And then now somebody's saying but Persona

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Rob you got to finish Persona 2

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Yeah that's another one of those games where I feel like

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Yeah I really need to revisit

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
That because that's another one of those games where like

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
I feel like you all

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Are telling me this and I've been resisting

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Well I've been resisting I just haven't had the time to play it

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
And I'll probably end up

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Falling in love with that one too so we'll see

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
So alright

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Let's move on we have a lot of gaming news

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
We want to cover tonight and get to that

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
So let's start off with

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Lowkey with some gaming news

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Alright so let's talk

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
A little bit about the

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Side Xbox

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Event that they did well not event

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
But like they had their little

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Stuff that they show off the new

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Games coming out so there's actually some pretty

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Cool interesting things here

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
So one of them of course

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Is a game called

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Grounded which is a survival

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Horror game or not make not

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
Survival game but imagine

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Any survival game set in the universe of

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Honey I Shrunk the Kids so basically

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
You're shrunk down to the size of

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Tiny little

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
I guess microscopic

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Characters and then of course

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Bugs and plants and everything are

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Giant and you're kind of like in a backyard

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Or something it's sim ant

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
I love that game

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
But it's but the answer

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Are much you know the

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Insects are much bigger than you are so

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
I'm not sure what your scale

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Is similar to like you know Honey I Shrunk

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Kids or something like that

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
So they have that what I thought was interesting

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Because you know there's people there deathly afraid

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Of spiders so they have an arachnophobia

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Setting that you can put on

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
So that you don't encounter spiders

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Which I thought was interesting

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
So they showed off that

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
They also

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Were talking about a

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Game called Forza Street which is

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Headed to Android and iOS

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
And

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
So that's kind of interesting

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Because they couldn't just let Mario Kart

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Be

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Somebody at Microsoft was like how do we get a piece

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Of that

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
No I'm all about it I'm for it

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
And then they talked a little bit about

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Of course

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Minecraft Dungeons is going to be releasing

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
At the end of May on the 26th

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Journey to the Savage Planet

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Is getting

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
An expansion called Hot Garbage

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Which I thought was hilarious

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
And that's coming out

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
This week on the 15th

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Then of course they talked a little bit about

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Gears Tactics

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Some of the new characters in that

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Talked a little bit about

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Hotline Miami Collection

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Which is going to be coming out on

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Xbox One at some point

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Atomic Crops

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
That's coming out on

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
May 28th

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
And then they were talking a little bit about

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
Sea of Thieves is getting another update

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
On April 22nd called the Ships of Fortune

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Which has an expanded

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Reputation system

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
They have overhauled the competitive mode

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
And new cosmetics

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
As well as cats

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
That's of course important

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
That's the most important thing

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Yes

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
And then of course a little bit about Games Pass

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Journey to the Savage Planet

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Football Manager 2020

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
We're going to be coming to Games Pass

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
For Xbox One and PC

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Last week and then Mistover

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
And Stranger Things 3 the game

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Are coming to PC Game Pass

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Sometime in the future as well as the Human

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Fall Flat expansion

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Thermal

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Evolstia Chronicles

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
And Yakuza Kiwami are going to be

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Available on both platforms

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
As well soon

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
And then they touched on

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Xbox Series X

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Seeing the games can be stored on an external

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Hard drive

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
They can be moved to internal memory

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Or the official

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Expansion drives in order to play them

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
I think this is kind of similar to what they were

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Talking about with even the PlayStation 5

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Saying that those drives

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
Have to be of a certain spec

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
In order to be able to run them efficiently

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
To be able to load everything

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
How you're supposed to so I think that's probably

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
Going to be similar with the Xbox

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Where you need a fast enough drive to run

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
I wonder if it's like

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
It's an archival storage

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
Like a workplace or something

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Where emails that are more than

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Six months old go to

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
An archive and they take a

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Lot longer to load because basically

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
You're going back retrieving it and bringing it over

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
To the current one so maybe that's kind of

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
Like what this is

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
It allows you to have a place to store the game

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
So you don't have to download it again if you're worried about

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Bandwidth issues or things like that but it basically

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Has to bring it over and copy

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
It back onto the drive so you

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Can play it from the super fast

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
D drive maybe that's kind of what it sounds like

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Like it's literally a localized

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Backup storage type of thing

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
And then of course they were also

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Saying that several countries

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
In western Europe

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Project xCloud as well

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
And Dragon Age Inquisition

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Unravel 2 and Sims 4

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Are now playable through that service

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Yeah I still

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Want to check out xCloud so hopefully I'll get to it

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
At some point but Xbox Game Pass is

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Continuing to be a great feature

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
I'm really happy to see what Microsoft's

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
Been doing with that I've been getting a lot of

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
My value out of that

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
During this quarantine period so

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Yeah I kind of want to see

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
What's on the PC one because

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
That sounded interesting

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Yeah and I did do the

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Preload for Minecraft which is so weird

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Preload but that's what it is for

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Minecraft Dungeons because that gets like

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
It's Minecraft but it's Diablo and I like

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Both of those things especially Diablo

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
So I'm really curious about that game

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Yeah I'll probably pick that up as well

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
I do want to play that so

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
We'll have to play together then

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Hey there's a Minecraft we'll play together for sure

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Absolutely

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Heck yeah

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Good job by Microsoft this week on like a little bit

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Of an update during this weird time

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
They were all, like Major Nelson was in his house

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Phil Spencer was in his house

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Everybody was kind of at home

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Kind of looked like that episode of Saturday Night Live

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
If you saw that this week

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
This is very strange, this is different

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Well I watch a lot of clips of

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Late shows

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
And so everybody's been kind of doing that

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Kind of weird

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
As well

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Hopefully they kind of expand out

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Just making fun of the usual

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Stuff that we have to deal with

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
I don't know

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
It was okay

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
The weird one for me is that guy on

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
CNN who actually

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Has COVID

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Who's still working

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Because it kind of goes

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
And he's doing it from his basement and everything

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
So it's not like he's putting anybody else at risk

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
But you're not supposed to go to work when you're sick

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
And you're going to work

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
I mean yes you're working out of your basement

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
But rest dude I don't know

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
That's the only one that's a little weird to me

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Because it kind of goes against the message of

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
You're not supposed to work when you're sick

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
And I get that he's in his own house

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
And he's not putting anybody else at risk

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
And maybe it's what he wants to do

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
I think he shouldn't but okay

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
So anyway

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Moving on

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Let's talk a little bit about this story again

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
And you might think Rob haven't you talked about this before

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
And yes this topic has come up on the show before

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Especially in this current situation

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
It has to do with

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Coronavirus slash COVID-19

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
And the World of Warcraft pandemic experience

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Why are we talking about it again?

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Because it hit the mainstream press again this week

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
And it's actually out of the Washington Post

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
So it's a pretty big

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Mainstream media coverage about what's going on here

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
And it was talking a little bit about

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
And it was actually written

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
I think the person that wrote the article

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
For the Washington Post

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Is like somebody who

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
I don't think they're a doctor

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
But they know a lot about the technological

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Ends of things and so forth

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
And have a lot of insight to what

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Is true in that scenario

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
And how that kind of plays out

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
With what's going on with COVID-19

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
And so a lot of the Washington Post article

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Kind of talked about the Corrupted Blood incident

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Which I think a lot of you are familiar with

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
At this point, long story short

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
There was a raid boss

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Who would poison you

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
But people figured out how to basically

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Take that poison from the boss fight

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
And take it into the real world

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
So to speak, not the real world

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
But you know what I mean like the towns and so forth

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
And Warcraft so that that poison would

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Spread throughout the towns and so forth

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
And it killed NPCs too

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
It did, it would kill NPCs, it would play

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Regular PCs of a different level and so forth

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Ironforge and Orgrimmar

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
They were overrun within hours

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
NPCs would get it

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
And then pass it on to other players and so forth

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
So kind of interesting

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
All the parallels there

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
And there was even a paper that the article refers to

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
That was published in 2007 that talks about

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Their findings and so forth

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
But what I find is interesting about this

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Is the kind of summaries

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
That this whole thing makes

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
And so they reached out for some

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Comment about that

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Article in the current research

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
About COVID-19

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
So the doctor that did this

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Let's see, it was Nina Fefferman

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Who played World of Warcraft at the time of the incident

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Has some comments about that

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
On the current COVID-19 situation

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Saying

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
What I do is I study all the aspects

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Of infectious disease outbreaks

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
We really saw the full gamut of behaviors

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
We see in the real world reflected in the

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Player characters during Corrupted Blood

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
There are games where you are encouraged

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
To behave in a way that you would never behave

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Offline

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
You really have to know the game

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Play it and understand the culture

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
So you can make these kind of determinations

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
That yeah, this is a pretty good proxy

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
And then

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
This actually was a quote

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
From the other doctor that was a colleague

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Of Nina Fefferman's

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
critic Lofgren who said

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Oh, I'm sorry, no, this was

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Sorry, I'm doing this on the fly here

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
There's two doctors, they're quoting back and forth

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
But Nina Fefferman said this and I thought this was a great quote here

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
It's not just that

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
People were role playing

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
People were being themselves

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
And I thought that was a very

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Kind of like harrowing

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Quote about the whole situation

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Is that in World of Warcraft

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Although there are role playing

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Servers and so forth

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
People can go role play as another character

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
The reason why this disease

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Was spreading and so forth

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Was not the result of somebody role playing

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Or wanting to do something different

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
They were doing what they wanted to do

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
And I think they're drawing some

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Parallels in this situation

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
In that situation

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
To what's going on in the COVID-19 situation

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Where we all know

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
We've seen it in the news

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
How some people are not respecting what's going on

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
With social distancing right now

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Meaning that they are above this virus

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Which does not discriminate

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Against people based on

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Whatever factor you can think of

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
And especially today

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Being a day of religious notoriety for some

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
You've all seen the news

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
About how some people

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Don't care

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
They believe it's not going to affect them

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
And we'll see how that plays out I suppose

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
But it's just very interesting

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
In those comparisons

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
That people were not role playing

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
They were just being themselves

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Dicks

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
What's that?

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
They were being dicks

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
And people in the real world can be dicks

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
We heard about

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
There was the guy in New Jersey

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Who they had to arrest

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Because he was going out well knowing he had the virus

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
And purposely infecting other people

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Or the people that are recording TikTok videos

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Of themselves coughing on all the produce

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
To the supermarket going I've got COVID

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
And even though they're lying about it

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Fuck them

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
They've actually arrested

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Quite a number of people for doing that

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
As well as those pastors

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Who are like we're going to hold services

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Fuck you

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Actually the real heroes have been the landlord

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
That changed locks on one of those churches here in Sacramento

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
As much as landlords

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Have been taking a beating on a lot of other things

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
That is landlord done well

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
In that circumstance

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Azet in chat says

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
There's going to be a spike in about a week

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Gosh I hope not

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
But you're probably right

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Tigerclaw says

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Another excellent example

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
And that happens in MMOs a lot

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
People will buy up the things they know

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Are going to be in demand for the next patch

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
This just happened in Final Fantasy 14

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Which is a game I play a lot of Materia

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Because these relic weapons just came out

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
And they have all these materia slots

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
So people were buying up the materia for cheap

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Then the patch drops and they're reselling it high

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
That's what people do in the real world too

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
You all heard the stories about the people

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Soaking up the sanitizer

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
And the toilet paper

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
I know you all saw that one guy who had the warehouse

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Or the politicians

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Selling their stocks

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Yes that too

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
It's interesting and I thought

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
It was worthy bringing up again

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Even though we've talked about the pandemic

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Especially hearing that from a doctor

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
That people were behaving

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
In this game just the way they would in real life

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
And seeing these types of comparisons

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Like you would think oh no people wouldn't troll people like that

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
And then it's like

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Fuck but they are though

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
They are

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
And so yeah there's a lot you can learn

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
From what happened in World of Warcraft

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
So

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
SSJ100Matt says if you don't believe in this virus

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Or think it's a joke come to New York City

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
It's not great and it's sad

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
And just

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Sorry I almost get choked up just thinking about it

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
I was just there in New York City

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
And obviously you know

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
I was there six months ago is nothing compared to

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Being there right now and living amongst it

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
But just know I am

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Thinking of y'all and I love that city

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
And I love the people and just

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
You know but that

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
That is as they say just the first place

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
You're gonna see this type of thing hit

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Other cities and especially in these places

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Where people can't seem to follow the goddamn rules

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
And I'm just very

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Thankful whereas

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
It was extraordinarily frustrating

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Maybe to be the first date

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Where they said nope shut it down

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
No restaurants no bars and so forth

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Maybe it was a little fresh but now in retrospect

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I think most people in California

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
And the San Francisco Bay Area

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
And the greater San Francisco Bay Area

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Are very thankful for that right about now

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
I think we're all very thankful for that

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
So anyway I don't want to speak out of turn

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
But anyway

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Alright

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
So my thoughts

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Really go out to you guys in New York City

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
And just know that I love you

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
And keep that distance

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
But hold through

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
We're all in it together

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
And we'll all

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Hopefully get through this

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Stay the fuck home

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
I am really happy that California

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Sent ventilators there

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Because they saw the need

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Was lessening here at least for right now

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
And they sent that and that is great

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I'm so proud of my state for doing that

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Well Rob we are a nation state

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
We are a nation state according to our governor

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
That was a very

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Anyway I don't want to get political

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
That was a very interesting power play

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
And although I am

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
I know this is a weird thing to say

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
But you guys know my mom passed a few years ago

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
And in many ways

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
I'm so thankful she didn't have to see this

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Because she was such a worrier

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
This situation would have been

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
So terrible for her mental health

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
That like

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
I'm just thankful she

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Didn't have to go through this

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
But the reason why I bring it up is that she

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
She loved Gavin Newsom

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
And that would be the one thing

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
She would be up and watching his

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Press conferences every single day

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
I tell you that

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Political fangirling?

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
She was

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
She said she was going to write him in

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
On the presidential ballot one year

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
I don't know if she actually did it

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I love your mom

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
I miss her everyday

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Let's go further down that

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Let's change the topic quickly

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
And talk about a different story

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
DarkSakura, more gaming news

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
So in other news

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
We are getting more information about

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
The Playstation 5 in the form of

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
It's new controller

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
DualShock? Screw that

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
We have the DualSense

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
And I'm looking at this thing

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Holding my hands up

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
At scale using distance

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
And everything

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
As people are

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Saying it might

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
It makes me think of a Saturn controller

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
A little bit of a Saturn

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Almost like the

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Saturn dual analog

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
You know

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
And it's not quite a boomerang

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
I'm just saying

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
I'm so glad you're making

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Those comparisons

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
And keeping it old school

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Because Twitter instantly lit up with

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Oh it's Microsoft

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
I'm looking for Microsoft

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
It's Microsoft's controller

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
And I'm going like what?

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
What?

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
The D-pad and the analog aren't even in the same fucking place

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
And if anything

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
It's shaped more like a Nintendo Switch Pro controller

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
I do not see the Microsoft comparison

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Whatsoever

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
And to be honest

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
I really would

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
I'm looking at the back of it as well

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
At the curving on it

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
It actually seems like it would be quite comfortable to hold

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Yeah

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
I can see where my fingers would fit

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Holding the back behind it

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
I can see where my thumbs would fit

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
It looks like it could be a pretty good controller

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
If this is the design they stick with

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
But at any rate

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
And I honestly

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
I think it's about damn time

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
That they went to a different design

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Although again though with the DualShock

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
If it ain't broke don't fix it

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
The DualShock was a pretty good controller

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Although I have to say

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
It's not that different

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
All these are considered

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Well and you know the problem I have with my wrist

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
I can actually though hold

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
My shift joy cons

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
In their little

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Cradle without a lot of pain

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
So

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
But going back

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
I think the thing that's weirding people out about the controller

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Is the bra

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
And if you don't know what I'm talking about

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Look at that black shape

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
The odd black against white

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
The little

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
It's more of a tank top

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
But those little

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Those little analog controllers are the boobies

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
But it's a bra

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
But anyway

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Whatever Rorshark shape

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
You see in that controller

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
I think that's like the white against black

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Well we all know you love boobs Rob

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
I do but that's the weird

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Conflicting thing for some people

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
But I also say

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Since the PlayStation 2 era

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
And probably before that Dreamcast

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
When has there ever been

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Just one first party color

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
You know there's gonna be other

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Colors so if the white on black bugs you that bad

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Just there'll be others

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Anyway sorry Darkshark I don't mean to interrupt

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
But I had to

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
At any rate

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
It's called the DualSense

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Not DualShock 5

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
It was announced this past Tuesday

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
It has

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Some different features like haptic feedback

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Adaptive triggers

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
And a built in microphone

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Which is interesting cause I mean

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Gosh you know reading about the

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Built in microphone kind of makes me think

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Back to the old Famicom controllers

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
I thought pole voice from Zelda

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Pole voice exactly

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
So

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
At any rate

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
It also is getting rid of the share

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Button from the DualShock 4

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Supposed to be replacing it with something

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Different

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
And the good thing about haptic feedback

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
As opposed to just having like rumble

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Especially you know

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Think of it in terms of like

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Say

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Using your iPhone or you know

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
My Apple Watch for example how the feedback

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Is a little bit different like for example

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Excuse me when I do my breathe app

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
I get a different you know

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Sensation for doing my breathing

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
And I think it's gonna be great we're gonna be able

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
To get all kinds of different levels

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Of sensation from that

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
You also have the adaptive triggers and the

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
L2 and sorry

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
R2 buttons so you get tension

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Like you know the example

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
From Nishino

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Who is a senior vice president of

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Platform planning and management at

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Sony Interactive Entertainment

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
He's saying that you can feel

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
The tension of your actions like when drawing

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
A bow to shoot an arrow

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
So what they're replacing

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
That share button with is a create button

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
So

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
They don't have much in the way of information

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
About that but they said it'll come out

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
They want to create

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Epic gameplay content that's a direct

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Quote those three words

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
So then

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
As far as that

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Microphone

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
They're doing it so that you can chat with your friends

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Without a headset for jumping into

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Quick conversation

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
But they're saying that if

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
You're gonna have like long term

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Chat then you wanna use a headset

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
You know

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
It does still have that

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Light bar but it's now

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Hugging around

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
The left and right sides of

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
The touch pad

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
And the buttons

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Are now monochrome instead of

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Multicolored it's using like this clear buttons

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
With the grey icons

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
On top of it and it does have

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
A microphone mute button from the appearance

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Of it so

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
And actually yeah there's an update

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Very recently that says that the

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Dual sense controller will have a built

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
In 3.5 millimeter headphone jack

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Oh wow

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
So it's still gonna have that

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
They confirmed that on Twitter

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
That's my favorite part of the tool stock

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Yeah that's kinda nice

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
That they're putting that technology right in there cool

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
And you know

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
The other thing too is that

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
I think it's going to

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Do its

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Charging

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
I think with a USB

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Yeah dual sense charges with the USB C

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
With the port located on the top of the controller

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Cool

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
There you go

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Yeah that's great

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Some comments from chat yeah Tigerclaw says

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
I bet the built in microphone will be used

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
So that when you plug in a regular headphone

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
You can just voice chat with the controller itself

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Yeah Sony actually confirming that's pretty much

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
What it's for it's kinda interesting

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
I'm sure there's gonna be a lot of tin foilers that

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Don't want their controller always listening

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
To them but I guess there is a mute button

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
On it and I guess you can always put tape

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Over it if you don't like it I don't know

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
I want pew pew mode where you can just say pew pew pew

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
And have it shoot

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
You never know you never know

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Let's see YYR says

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Haptic feedback ugh why do they have to put that nonsense

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
In everything I don't know I kinda

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
I love haptic feedback I dig it in the phone

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Although sometimes they overdo it

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Some games and some things

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Really overdo it on that

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
But I kinda dig like the way they use it

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
On the phone and I'm excited to see how that

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Translates to cause obviously

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
On the trigger buttons that's gonna be very different

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Than the phone right that's gonna be

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
A different kind of feeling so I'm kinda

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
I'll give it a shot sounds interesting

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Well there's the big thing about

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Haptic feedback

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
That I think is absolutely beautiful

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Especially as we're dealing more with accessibility

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
These days like

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
I was reading a post from

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Sturlok on Twitter not long ago

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
About being able to play

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Animal Crossing without being sighted

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
And a lot of that comes in

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
With you know the sound effects

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Like the sound design in Animal Crossing is tremendous

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
But with haptic feedback

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
You know you have a better idea

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
For you know say

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
You know

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Say that you are getting

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Footsteps

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Near you

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
You know how sometimes depending on the floor you can feel them

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Or someone breathing

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
And you might get just like a little

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Little subtle rumble

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
When someone's breathing in the room with you

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
You know

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Or you know you're

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Say climbing like a rope in your game

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
And you get the feeling of the tension

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Of the rope like have you ever been on

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
A rope when it's about to snap?

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Or pulled something that's about to snap?

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
You kinda get that tension

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
And imagine having

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Feedback when you're playing

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
A game that's just you know and for those of us

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Who have I'd say

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Full access to our senses

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
You know

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Think about the immersion that you're

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Gonna get with something like that

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
But I'm more thinking in terms of our

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Friends who need more accessibility

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
I think it'll be great for them

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
And YYR is conceding that point in chat

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Saying see I hate haptic feedback on my phone

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
First thing I did was turn it off but yeah I get that

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
It does make some things more accessible

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
And that is very good

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
And Mich in chat says

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
I usually turn haptic off because it messes

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
With the nerves in my hands

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
So yeah it just kinda might depend on you

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
And your body if this is something that is

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Gonna work for you or not work

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
For you I also wanted to address this point

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Cause I thought this was a when we talk about

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
That create button YYR says

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
If YouTubers are creators

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
What does that make the people actually

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Creating games?

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Artists in my opinion

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
But that's my

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Answer maybe yours is different

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
I think this is our difference between

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
A professional like a patissier

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
And a home cook home baker

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Or a pastry chef

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Well that's what a patissier is

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Yes I know I know for those

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
That may not know yes

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Anyhow

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Alright any other comments on the dual sense

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Controller

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
It purred

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Oh and then I will say this I think Loki

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Had a story on this probably about two months

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Ago where there was like a patent

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Or something that had been filed on this

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
We kinda knew this haptic thing was coming

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
So you know for those that

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Don't always like us covering the

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Rumors and the unverified

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Sometimes where there is smoke there is

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Fire so we knew some of these things a couple months

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Ago or at least we had a

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
I don't know if it was a patent

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
But they were

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Just some of the features

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
That were gonna come to the controller

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
They just didn't show us what the controller looked like yet

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
I felt like there was some type of tech specifications

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Whatever I like I know we talked about the

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Haptic thing a couple months ago so it's kinda interesting

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
So anyway alright let's move on to the next story

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Loki

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Alright so

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
This is kinda cool so everybody is doing their part

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
To try to help

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
In the 2019 situation

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
You have folding at home

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Allowing you to contribute in that sense

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
To try to find a

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Cure

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Well now Borderlands 3 is kinda jumping in on that

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
As well they have a thing called Borderlands

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Science

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
A game that you can play within

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Borderlands 3 through

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
In the Infirmary

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
In Sanctuary 3 which is the spaceship

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
In the game so

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
What it allows you to do is actually

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Kind of like a

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Block matching game

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
And apparently the puzzle

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Game the way it works

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
It's basically

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Allowing you to

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Correct millions of small computer errors

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
That arise as scientists try to map

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Microbiomes of the human gut

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Apparently doing this will allow

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
You to allow them to

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Better understand

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Or have a better understanding of the human body

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Which in turn benefits research and the conditions

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Like obesity, diabetes and even depression

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
How does that

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
How does that work? Is that you

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Actually playing the game is doing that?

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Or is it that the game

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Is so low

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Doesn't tax so many

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Resources on your system that it actually

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Uses some other resources in the background

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
To do that other part

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
So what I think it is

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Is it's basically

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
The computer does the matching

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
And then anything that it can't

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Figure out it's allowing humans

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
To kind of look at

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
To try to figure stuff out

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
The game itself

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
It's kind of interesting looking

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
It's

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
It does look like

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Kind of like a block matching game

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
I'm just trying to see

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Like actually

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
How you match stuff together

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
I mean

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
It's interesting

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
It's interesting

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.000
S2100Matt in chat says

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Oh how nice of Gearbox to come out with this feature

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
After hosting their employees on those

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Performance bonuses

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Yeah that's quite the

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Retort although to be fair

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
It was probably those employees who actually made

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
This feature in the game so

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
You know

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
The other issue needs to be addressed

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
A little more at the top of the food chain

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
I believe so

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Anyhow

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
That story aside

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
This is

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
I love these kind of like gamers doing good

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Kind of like harnessing the power of

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Games to do these other

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Things is pretty neat

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Yeah it's interesting

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
And it is

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
It's a little bit I mean it is still like

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
A match three type

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
But it's a little bit different

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Arrows that you have

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
To basically insert at the bottom

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Of your row to kind of move those rows up

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
To match three

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
And then it breaks them apart

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
So it's a little different but

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
It's interesting

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
And I guess with that you also get

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
weapons and stuff out of that

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
You earn the in game currencies

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Alright

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Well we'll have to check that out

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
I'll have to check it out I don't know

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
I don't know Borderlands 3 yet

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Yeah I haven't played Borderlands 3 in a while

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
It's been on sale a lot

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
I'll have to look into it

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Especially now it's off the Epic store

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
And it's available in more places so we'll see

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Alright

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Well anyhow moving on for now

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Let's talk about Final Fantasy 14

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
A game I do play a lot of

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
And COVID-19 has had an impact

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
On Final Fantasy 14's development

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Final Fantasy 14 has been on a pretty

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Almost like clockwork it's release schedule

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
It's like they go X many a week

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
There's a patch then there's another patch

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
And then there's the expansion like everything is almost like clockwork

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Which actually some people kind of criticize

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
14 about is that it's

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Patch cycle almost gets too predictable

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Like it's going to be a dungeon here and a raid here

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
And they don't tend to break that predictability

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
A lot well

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
The situation of what's going on in the real world

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Is causing some things to get pushed back

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Game director producer Naoki

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Oshida put a

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Update to the community this week about what's

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Going on saying we are terribly sorry

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
For the disappointment this may cause our players

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
As we know you look forward to new patches

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
However it's also important to prioritize the physical

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
And mental health of our development team

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Without whom we would never be able to release the

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Quality updates and features you expect from Final Fantasy 14

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
So we ask under your

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Ask for your understanding as we adjust our

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Schedule in accordance with the situation

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
So basically talking about that this most

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Recent patch most of the

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Development was done for the fight because they just

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Released a 5-2-5 patch

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
That was pretty much done right before they released

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Or right before all this you know work at home

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
And all that kind of disrupted in Japan

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
So now this is going

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
To push some things back so they're

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Basically saying 5-3 was going

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
To come out in June

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
It probably is going to miss that date

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Due to the situation what's

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Going on so you know

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
And he's got graphic designing

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Teams in Asia, North America,

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Europe and all over

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
So basically the game is going to

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Have its content delayed for a month or two

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
And really quite an explicit

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Apology there from Yoshida

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
To as somebody who's been playing Final Fantasy 14

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Ever since the

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Realm Reborn alpha

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Let me say it's okay

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
We completely understand

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Like it's really fine

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Like do what the team

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Has to do to

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Take care of themselves and so forth

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
And yeah it's

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
If things slip a month or two it's okay

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
It's sad that

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Fan fest may or may not happen in November

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
I mean I know that's a ways out we'll see

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Where the state of the world is at that point

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
But it's

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Really okay I understand there's other

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Priorities right now and there's

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Plenty of things to do in Final Fantasy 14

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
And you know what if I get burned out on it

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
I've got like a backlog a mile high

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Of other games I need to be catching upon anyway

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
So it's fine so anyhow

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
I thought that was a very nice letter for them to write

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
They really don't owe us that

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
I thought it was very nice that they did

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
But they didn't have to

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Alright let's move on Dark Soccer are you back?

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Okay I know she went ahead

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
That's okay would you like to go ahead and do the next story

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Or want me to come back to you

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
I can do the next story

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Anyway

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
You know we've kind of

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Gotten off especially with all the

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
COVID news and everything

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
About the protests in Hong Kong

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
And the free Hong Kong protests

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
So

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Of all places for the protests

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
To find a new home in

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
It's an animal crossing

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
So since people

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Can't go to the street

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Protesting in force

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Is not physically safe

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
People are going into

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
An unregulated

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Area to do so

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
And that is animal crossing

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
So they are putting up

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
You know signs

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
You can do your patterns

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
And you can actually do nice big patterns

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
That you can lay out

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Like as big mats on the ground

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Like people normally do pads

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Some people have signs

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
In their houses

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Their characters are wearing

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Gas masks and privacy masks

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
And doctors masks

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
And whatever things that can

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Hide their face

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
As a version

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Of what they're going to be doing in real life

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
And putting the information out there

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
And reposting it to Twitter

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Or wherever they need to

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Having pictures

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Of

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
You know of people

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
They've lost in the struggle

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
People who are important to

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
The protest

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
And since you know

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
They're wanting to

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
And actually this is a quote

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
That one of the students involved in this

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Was saying that animal crossing is a good way

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
For us to remind people

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Not to forget what happened in the past

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Eight months

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Not everyone is open to political stuff

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Animal crossing is a good way to promote our mission

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
To those who are politically apathetic

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
So

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Keep going

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
You know do it where you can

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
I think it's beautiful

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Now I believe there was

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
A follow up or something

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Animal crossing I believe has been banned

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
And I think

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
This stuff might

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Have something to do with it

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Obviously they're neither confirming nor denying

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
But one can draw a pretty substantial

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Conclusion from what

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
History has shown us in this situation

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
So yeah

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Questbuster says just a week or so ago

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
There was news about how animal crossing had a big

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Launch in China and people started using it

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
To recreate scenes including COVID

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Checkpoints and now just recently

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Animal crossing was pulled

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
I hope all these people have physical copies

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Yeah well it's

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Isn't that interesting because

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
You can't really pull it now that it's out there

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
I mean you can stop it from being sold again

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
But as you all know that just drives

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Demand the product up even higher

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Take your system offline

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
So it can't pull a

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
PT

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
I realize China is a very different society

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
And they have different ways of doing things

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
But I still feel like

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Once it's out there

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
People are going to find a way

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
They will

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Well let's move on we have a few more stories for you guys

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Before we get to the classic game of the week

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Loki

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Let's see so

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Let's talk a little bit about

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Stadia

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
So Stadia of course you may know

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Or are going to be hearing

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
That Stadia Pro has gone free

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
For two months so I'm assuming that

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
With the whole everybody having to be home

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
The whole COVID-19 stuff

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
So they said

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Google basically said in their blog

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Hey video games can be a valuable way to socialize

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
With friends and family when you're stuck at home

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
So we're giving gamers in 14 countries

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Free access to Stadia for two months

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
That's from Phil Harrison

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
And so basically with that

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
You can access

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Stadia Pro

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
You don't necessarily

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Need a Stadia controller or

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Chromecast

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
But you can

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Use your controllers and stuff like that

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
You do need a Gmail account

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
To be able to participate in that

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
And then of course it comes with some free games as well

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
And they have

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Of course

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Destiny and Grit and stuff like that

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
So is this something

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
That you're going to jump back in

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Since you've already got your free one

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
You know what's funny I wrote some tweets

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
About it because I was like I can't figure out how to

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Reactivate this because

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
I was on Pro thanks to the friend code

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Thing because Bobby had given me

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
His friend code and so I had it for three months

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
And then I remembered to cancel it before the 90 days

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Ran out so that I

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Didn't get charged for another month because

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
As much as I thought it was fine

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
I never really intended to buy

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Any more games on the service

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
I was really just playing the free ones

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
That came with Pro

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
So I didn't really

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
See the need to keep it and keep

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Paying $10 a month for games that

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
I kind of felt like there was more on

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Something like Xbox Game Pass I wanted to play

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
But I was like alright well if they're giving it away

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Free for another two months maybe I'll go back and try it again

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Because I don't dislike Stadia

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
I think from a tech perspective

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
It's actually pretty impressive and I talked about this

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
When I talked about playing the Stadia

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Before

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
It's like interacting with a YouTube

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Live

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
And it works pretty darn well and so I think it is

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
A piece of technology worth checking out

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
My only concern is

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Again I haven't gone in there so I don't know how this one

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Is set up but is

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
This the gotcha gym membership

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Thing where they get you to sign up for

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
So many days free and then oh your

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Credit card is on file which with

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Google it probably is already

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
On file if you've ever bought anything

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Through Google they have your credit card

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Info already if you forget to

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Cancel are you going to get charged at the end of the 60 days

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Again I don't know how

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
This one is set up so I don't want to accuse Google

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Of doing something they're not doing

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Yes so here's what the way it's

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Says

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
You're cutting out a little bit Loki

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
It says what?

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Sorry so it says anybody that

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Signs up for Google Stadia

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Will get access to all the games

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
It says if you're

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Already a Stadia Pro member you won't be charged

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Next two months

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
After that Stadia Pro is $9.99

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
A month but you can opt out of your subscription

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Anytime so yes it is

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
The hey sign up

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Now for free but remember to cancel

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
It before those two months are up otherwise

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
We're going to charge you $9.99

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
I

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
If I'm understanding this that

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Way then I actually

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Think this is an incredibly

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Shitty thing that Google did

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Because they're using this

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Situation to get

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
People on their product

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
If I'm understanding it

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
That way that you

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
You have to cancel yourself

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
After 60 days

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Or gotcha you're going to renew

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
At $9.99 a month

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Then I kind of think

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
That's really shitty

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Of Google to use this situation

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
It is what they're doing

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
So

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
The best business as usual

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
For a lot of subscription

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
It is

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
With that being said

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
All I'll say is

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
The technology is

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Worth it but please

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
If you do decide to do it

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Immediately set yourself a calendar

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Reminder at 55 days out

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
To

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Decide if you really want it or not

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
I will say this

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Unlike a lot of gyms and that stuff

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
When it comes to gyms you have to call somebody

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Or cable you have to call somebody

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
And they're going to try to talk you into staying

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
I will give Google credit with this

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Canceling you just do it online

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
You click a button done

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
So I will say that you don't have to interact with anybody

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
You're not going to get pressured into staying or anything like that

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
But

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Just be warned

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Ain't nothing really free

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
In this world I guess

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Alright

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Make your own decision on if that's for you

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Again from the technology perspective

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
I think it is worth checking out

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
But please set yourself a calendar reminder at 55 days

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
To evaluate if you really

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Want it

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
YYR in chat says

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Don't be evil slash strike through

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
That part

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Alright

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Moving on to how

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Business is being affected on

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Different sides of the ocean

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
The ESRB apparently

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Still going amongst what's going on

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
With the coronavirus and COVID

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Is that there is no delay right now

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
In assigning game ratings

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
At least that's what they're saying

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
I imagine most of that is still working from home

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
From what I recall of the ESRB

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
I don't think they're actually playing

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
A lot of the games

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
You kind of have to fill out a packet

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
And they kind of assign the rating based on the packet

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
And it's assumed that you did that in good faith

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Because if they find out you didn't do that in good faith

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Such as what happened with things like Oblivion

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
And Grand Theft Auto 4

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
With the hot coffee mod and all that stuff

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
That's when things get dicey with the ESRB

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
But they are still going

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
They are still doing ratings and so forth

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Whereas the CERO

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Or is it pronounced CERO

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
They are temporarily closed in Japan

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Due to what's going on in that situation

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
So there are no ratings currently

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Being assigned right there

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
That could cause a little bit of a backlog

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
It may impact some of the game releases

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
I don't know what's going to come of that there

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
But that is a little bit of a difference

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Of what's going on over there in that situation

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
I don't know if they're actually playing the games

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Or what happened in that scenario

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Alright, well let's go back to a simpler time

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Dang it, we're going to go back to when

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
The games weren't rated at all

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Actually I'm not sure the selection is from that period of time

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
But we're still going to go back in time

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
At least ten years

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
And visit a classic game

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Every week on this show Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
And says, hey, brats

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Instead of playing these modern newfangled remakes

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Why don't you go back and play the demakes of yesteryear

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Dark Sakura

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
This was top notch when it came out

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
It was, this is much more than 8-bit

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.000
A title from the CD and DVD era

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:18.000
This classic game is Project Justice

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Which, like how have I not done this yet?

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:24.000
I mean, I actually had to go check multiple

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Things to see if I, you know, had even remotely done it

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
So, as it was called in Japan

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
It was Moro Justice Gakuen

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Which basically burned Justice Academy

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
The, you know, the previous before was

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
She Needs Justice Gakuen

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Which is private, Justice Academy

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
So, it is a 3D fighting game

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.000
That came out released from Capcom

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
It's a sequel to Rival Schools and United by Fate

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:54.000
And, which was, you know, first released as an arcade game

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
In 2000 and ported to the Dreamcast in 2001

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.000
And fortunate enough to have been able to play

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
The arcade machine

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Because they had it at SVGL

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
I do

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.000
I remember whenever we weren't doing that

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:14.000
TBR tournament that was inside there

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Because I was doing Perfect Attack at that one

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
I was over there playing Project Justice

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
That was the one where Jessica and I

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Switched out in platform shoes

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Remember we said we were gonna, we did

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.000
A Perfect Attack wearing platforms

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Which was pretty fun

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
I do remember that and I'm stepping away for just a moment, sorry

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Okay, so at any rate

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Project Justice is to this day

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Probably one of my favorite fighting games

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.000
As far as I love the Rival Schools

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:45.000
This one is totally, totally, you know, for me

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Just really goes there with it

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.000
So, it is still a team fighter

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.000
But you have teams of three instead of two

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
So you get extra team up attacks

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
That you can use

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
But another one called a party up

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:03.000
So that you would initiate by pressing any three attack buttons together

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:06.000
And it is a three person attack

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:11.000
That relates to whatever the school

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Where that character comes from

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.000
You also have an additional

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
You know, your additional partner

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Will also let you cancel an opponent's team up special

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.000
By putting in a team up of their own

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.000
So you have like a different short fighting sequence

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Between one character from one team

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.000
And whoever gets the first hit in

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Will, you know, be the winner of that one

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000
And then it swimmers back to the main fight

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:42.000
So you have a bigger meeting

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Also twelve that's five levels

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Instead of nine from Rival Schools

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.000
The party up attack uses all five levels

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Team up to two

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Any attempts to cancel

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Cost one level

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Also carrying over from the first game

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Project Justice from Dreamcast in Japan

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Has a character creation mode that allows you to create your own team fighter

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000
It can be used in all the modes except for single player

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.000
But its package is a board game

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Which you do during an inter-school festival

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Instead of the dating of the first Rival Schools

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.000
You also

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:28.000
And actually I have the Japanese version

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
So I got to do this, it was pretty fun

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:34.000
And you can also get sub characters

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:37.000
That you can unlock through this mode

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:43.000
You still have your players that are in the game

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.000
And a few things that have changed

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.000
So you've got

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Like extra, you know, some of the other characters

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.000
When you have new people to be hinted at

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Like in the Rival Schools revolution

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Or I should say, Phoenix Justice

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Right now I forgot what it was called

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
The Evolution Justice

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Which I need to put back

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Basically, things have gone back to normal in this

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.000
And then there's a group called Reverse Society

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.000
That comes back in so they have to fight again

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.000
We have a new character, Kuro Kirishima

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:28.000
And Momo

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
I always miss a person

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Karui Zawa

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Who is like this pretty violent player person

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:43.000
You also have the leader of the Gedo Gang, Daigo

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Who was peripherally a character in the first game

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Being mind controlled, so you have mind control

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.000
And then you also have a Batsu doppelganger called Vatsu

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:58.000
So trying to pin it all on Batsu

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
So you've got all kinds of different stuff

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
You have

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
You even have

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:09.000
They even go all out with your swimmer character

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:15.000
And you can play as the school president and everything

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
It's pretty fun

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:21.000
But again, one of my absolute favorite fighting games out there

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:27.000
There are people who didn't like it

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
And those people are wrong

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Famitsu gave it a 33 out of 40

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:35.000
A lot of people, it got kind of an average review

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Higher end of average

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
But you know what?

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
The game is fun

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
That's the important thing about it

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:48.000
It's got that goofiness

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:55.000
It was friends of mine who did the localization on the first tribal schools

01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:03.000
And I think that we had just that same heart that went into the original localization

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:07.000
They kept a lot of the Japanese dialogue

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
The translation is like

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:13.000
It's so funny if you listen to what people say in the game

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
And you know enough to follow the conversation

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:19.000
Like, oh, I see what they went there with in this localization

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
That's fully not what they said

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
It's always fun

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
It's fun

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.000
I cannot state enough how beautiful this game is

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:33.000
And we need to make it trend rivals schools 3

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Make it happen

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
We need to make it happen

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
We need like

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
I'm trying to think where they could go

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Because we had Chirich Justice Gakuen

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
And then had Moro Justice Gakuen

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:49.000
What can they do that's even more than that?

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Like maybe hot-blooded Justice Gakuen

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
We already have burning

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
We do

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
But anyway

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
The game is great

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
If you haven't played it, sucks to be you, go get it

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Somehow

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
There it is, the classic game of the week

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Project Justice

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Which DarkSakura is amazed that she never picked before

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
But there's always more hidden gems to be found

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Like how could I have not

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Questbuster in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:21.000
I love the days when Capcom could afford to be occasionally crazy with their ideas

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Hugs copy of Pocket Fighter

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
I mean

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
There's

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
I wish that we would get

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
A 2D Capcom collection

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
So that we can have things like

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
CyberBots and Red Earth

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
I have two copies of CyberBots

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
I have the limited edition and the regular one

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
But

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
I would love to have

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
The not released in America

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Fighting game pack

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Oh yeah

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
There was just recently that Kunio-kun collection

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
With all these NES games

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
That were never released here

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
And then of course

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Secret of Mana 3

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Or Trials of Mana if you will

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Finally broke that barrier

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
And the remake

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Or remaster whatever you want to call it

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Is on its way out pretty soon too

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
So it's almost like all these old things that never came out

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Are finally new again

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Is Nintendo listening?

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Mother 3? Hello?

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
You know I actually bought

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
A repro cart that had been translated

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Just to sit down and play it

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
Mother 3

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
If you want to borrow it you're welcome to

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Did you see the Animal Crossing level?

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
That opted all the

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Stuff from the Mother series

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
It looked really cool

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
It was really well done

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Google it

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
It'll be out there somewhere

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Did you hear what I read from Orange Wright?

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
The Not Street Fighter Anniversary collection

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Oh yeah for sure

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
I'd love to see something like that

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Just before we went on air tonight

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
I don't think it's coming up later in the show

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Capcom I think said

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
They're looking at a rumor is

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
I think it's a rumor that's why I didn't really put it there

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
That Resident Evil 4 remake is coming up next

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Even though

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Who would surprise no one?

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
That one is so good I don't know if they should remake it

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Whatever they're going to

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Because the other two have done very well in sales

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
But there is a part of me that's like

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Why don't you explore some other things

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Some other games that you have

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Well Dan and I were talking about this earlier

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
And if they're going to redo one

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
You know what?

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
I want Code Veronica

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
That's what a lot of people are saying

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
It's funny you say that because that actually is like

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
What comes the next breath

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
What a lot of people are saying when people are talking about

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
The Resident Evil 4

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Code Veronica next

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Yeah Thar66 in our chat right there

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
I would have preferred Code Veronica

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Yeah a lot a lot of people out there saying that

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
So we'll see we'll see what happens from Capcom

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Because I don't believe they've officially announced anything yet

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Alright well there you go

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Code Veronica though was to me pinnacle

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
So just saying

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
There it is the classic game of the week

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Let's do some rapid fire news

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Loki we'll start with you

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
So the updates for No Man's Sky

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Just keep on coming

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
We've got pretty cool stuff

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
In the giant mechs

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
You get to pilot so the exomech

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Is part of

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Update 2.4

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
And allows you to pilot these mechs

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
And of course they are immune to planetary

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Hazard and they

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Have a pretty awesome cockpit as well

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
And look pretty awesome in fact I

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Decided to make the picture of the mech

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
That they posted on Twitter

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
My background for my work here

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Looks pretty awesome it's almost like a little bit

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
No Man's Sky-ish but of course much slower

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Not as fast

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
But

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
I really do need to go play this game

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Maybe I'll install it on my hard dress

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
But yeah so

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Check it out it's free if you own the game

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Yet another thing to go check out

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Exactly

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Well if you're looking for some

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
More pre-games to play during

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
This whole COVID-19

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Situation then

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
You'll be lucky to know that

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Just Cause 4 is going to be

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Among the free games that are on

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
This coming week on the Epic Games

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Store and that's pretty awesome because I

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Did skip this game which I think I did

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
And maybe I have it in my catalog

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
I don't remember

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
And so

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Yeah it'll be nice

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
To have this and actually be able to

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Now I'm second guessing

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Myself maybe I did buy this on PlayStation

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
4 and I just completely forgot about it

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Maybe the first time that I've gotten the game

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
And completely forgotten about it

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
But anyways along with that

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
There's going to be some other games

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Including a visual novel

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Of Aurelia

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
That's also going to be coming

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Free as well and then if you act now

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Sherlock Holmes Crime and Punishments

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
And Close to the Sun are free

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
But those are only going to be free

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Until Tuesday when these

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
New games will come up and we'll be free then

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
I get those annoying

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Little messages in the system tray that remind me

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
To download those free games so that's

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Kind of nice I guess

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Yes so definitely do that

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Just because I should

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Probably convince my son to download it

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Because he'd have fun playing that game

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Alright well let's

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Move on to some other stories

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
This one has to do with Discord and a new

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Beta feature that's happening in Discord

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Called the Background Noise Reducer

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
You may have seen this in your own Discord

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
It just showed up there for me in the bottom left

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
So it is a noise suppression

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Beta feature

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
It's only on the desktop version of the app though not the mobile version

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
And it is supposed to reduce

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
And remove background sounds so voice

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
And video chat folks only hear you

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Speaking and you shouldn't hear that clack clack

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Clack clack of a keyboard or the

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Kids in the background or the pots and pans

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Clanging or whatever it is going on

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
The technology is from a company called

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Crisp and it is running locally

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
It is not sharing data with anybody else

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Development is still early on and they are

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Working on a phone version of it

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
So that's cool

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
A lot of other meeting software could use something like that

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
That's for sure

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
I'm really excited about this other feature here

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
That Twitch is looking at doing or is actually

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Rolled out to partners

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
It's called Prime Watch Parties

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
So it's kind of like that Netflix Party idea

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Except you're kind of leveraging Twitch

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
And you have to have

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
A Twitch Prime or excuse me

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
A Amazon Prime to really like

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
If you don't have an Amazon Prime subscription

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
You don't see the webcam or whatever of the person watching

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
But if you have both

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
You get the webcam of the person watching in the corner

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
And then you actually get like the

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Amazon Prime show whatever they're watching

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Timed up to where they're at

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
In the main screen so you actually get both at the same time

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
So it's kind of like an interactive watch party

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
They've actually been kind of

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Playing with this feature since October last year

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
But now all partners have available

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Have the access to be able to use this

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
I was looking at one earlier today

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
And my instant reaction was like

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
I want to do this at VOG

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
I want to get some of the

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Star Trek, Starboard power coupling people together

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
And watch episodes of Star Trek

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Wouldn't that be great?

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Except it's not out for affiliates yet

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
And I'm not sure

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
It's a little weird because you have to link

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Your Amazon Prime account

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
To your Twitch

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
And since VOG Network

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
This account isn't really a person

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
I'm not sure we're going to be able to really do that

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
So it might just have to be something on my personal channel

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
But it's still something that I'm really interested in doing

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Because I think that's really fun

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
And especially in this day and age

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
That's the type of stuff we could really use

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
So yeah

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
I think it's a really cool idea

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
It kind of takes that Netflix party

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
To the next level

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Because Netflix

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
That used to be a thing on Xbox 360

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Then they kind of shot it down

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
And then there's an unofficial

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Google Chrome add-on

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
That kind of does the same thing

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
That hasn't been shut down yet

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
So I don't know

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
S2100matt in chat says

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
First name VOG, last name Network

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Middle name Smush

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
You never know

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
I don't want to break the rules

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
We're professionals here most of the time

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
So I mean if I can just use

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
My personal account on VOG's thing

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Then I would do it but I don't want to break the rules

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
So as long as everything is

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
By the rules then we'll figure out a way

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
But if I have to do it on my personal channel then I will

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
DarkSakura, how about you?

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Well

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
We have an update

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
About Adi

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Everybody's Animal Crossing

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Grandmother

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
The one who logged 3500

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Hours playing

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
On New Leaf

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
Well the internet got together

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
All of her fans out there

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
And had

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
A crowd funding

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
To buy her

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
The limited edition Animal Crossing

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Switch

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Which I watched the unboxing

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
It was adorable

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
She's like I don't know how to do the button

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
You know

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
I want to say

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Is this her grandson helping her

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Create her character and everything

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
But we need to see

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
If Adi actually gets Adi

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
In her town which would be great

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
As we know

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Nintendo of America

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
So

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
We'll see

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
I just think it's an absolutely sweet

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
She just looked tickled to bits

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
And really amused by the whole thing

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
And then

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
In other news

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Regarding Streets of Rage 4

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
It is coming quote soon

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
With classic characters

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
And with soundtracks

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
There was a tweet

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
By Lizardcube

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
That confirmed the existence

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Of classic characters and the original soundtracks

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
And also

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Bringing back returning

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Characters like Max Gate

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
And Dr. Zahn

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Are playable in their 16-bit forms

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
With a price of $24.99

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Confirmed

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
But it does not confirm the April 23

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Release date

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
And only that it is coming out soon

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
However there was an Australian

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Nintendo eShop

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Listing

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
That stated that it would have

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
A storefront release on April 23

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
With a price of around $38

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Australian dollars

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Which is roughly $25 US

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Listing says 12 unique

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Stages and the ability to unlock

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
And play as classic characters

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
An option to switch out the new

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Soundtrack with the

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Original Streets of Rage games

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
And so

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Hey there we go

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
Alright sounds

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Good I'm excited to hear that new

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Soundtrack that sweet new Yuzo Koshiro

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Music very excited

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
I love Yuzo Koshiro's music

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Let's travel around the world and check out the release

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Dates for this week although I have a feeling

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
There might not be a lot but we'll check

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
In anyway and

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Check out the releases so

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Let's start with the US

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Alright

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Not much

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Ace Engineers coming out

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Vampire

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Masquerade

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
New York on Xbox One

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
And

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Pretty much it

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
I was just gonna see

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
If there's any other digital games

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Since this list doesn't have a lot of digital games

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
So I'm gonna read some of the weird named titles

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
That are on this list like for example

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
We've got a game

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Called Save

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
Your Nuts on Xbox One and

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Switch. The Double Dragon

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Collection looks like it's coming out on

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
PlayStation 4 and Switch so we have Double Dragon

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
On PS4 and

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Double Dragon 3 on PS4

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Double Dragon 2 on PS4 and

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Switch and River City Ransom

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Coming to PlayStation 4 as well this week

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Lots of like digital games coming out this week

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
So yeah where is there may not be a lot of

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Games coming out

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
There's definitely

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Games you can check out like Super Forklift

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
3000 on PC

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Alright nice

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Alright let's travel over to Japan

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
And check out the release dates in Japan this week

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Although I'm not seeing an awful lot

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Happening let's see

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
On the 17th on the Nintendo Switch

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
There's a Guacamelee

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Collection coming out that's I think the

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Only thing I really see there

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Looking on the PlayStation 4

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Do we have anything different there? No that's

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
That's it it's a very quiet

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Week in Japan this week but

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Considering everything that's going on I'm kinda not surprised

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
How about the UK Dark Soccer

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Crickets chirp chirp

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Nothing until the 22nd

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
Yeah with all that's going on I'm not too

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Surprised about that alright

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
We're gonna do things a little bit out of order because

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
I know Dark Soccer has to cut out soon here

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
So I'm gonna shake up what you see on the

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Sidebar a little bit so Dark Soccer do you wanna take your

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Next story here which is actually at the bottom

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Of the list there for those watching

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
On Twitch for those on the podcast feed you have no idea what I'm talking about

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
We actually show the upcoming headlines

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
So we're gonna do this one down here at the bottom

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Before Dark Soccer says goodnight

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
This one's a doozy so

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
It is a very very

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Write up by

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
CNET and I'm more than happy

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
To share this with people but I'm gonna give you the

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Cliff notes on it just because it is

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
Absolutely worth mentioning

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
So they're talking

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
About the upcoming

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Systems in the climate crisis

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
That our next generation

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Consoles could be worse for the

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Environment

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
And

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
There's actually a

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Game studio called Wildworks where

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Their CEO Clark Stacey

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Is quoted saying I don't think it

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
Occurred to many people in the games industry to ask

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
What sort of climate impact came directly

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
From making and playing

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Games

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
But they're looking at

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Things like the

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Output of these

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Systems and what they're releasing

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
In just carbon dioxide

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
For example the PS4

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Said that

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Basically if you have

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
100 million PlayStation 4 units sold

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Since 2013

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Generated approximately

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
9.8 million tons of carbon dioxide

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Which would put it at

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
108th place for

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Emissions in 2016

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
It would outrank Costa Rica

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
It would outrank the entire country

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
And then

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
In energy usage that number

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Would double

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
And then

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Xbox one

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
They have a slightly

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Smaller

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
But a single

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Xbox unit emits

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
1.23 tons of carbon dioxide

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Over an eight year life cycle

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
And so

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
It is a lot more friendly

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Than say the PS4 for its release

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
But it would still be 0.76 tons

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
And

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
If you were using a less conservative

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Estimate

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
That

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
The general output from these systems

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Would be something along the lines

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Of taking between 40 and 95

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Million flights from New York

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
To Los Angeles

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
So

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Pretty intense

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
So the video games industry

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Please Sony

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
And Microsoft

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Have been challenged

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
To do

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
To do better

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
And so

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
Actually

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
For

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
The average PCs

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
And current generation of consoles

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
They account for 2.4%

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
Of residential electricity expenditures

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
In the US

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
And have a carbon emission release

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
Of 24 million tons

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
Which is about the same as Sri Lanka

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
In 2017

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
So a whole country

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
The devices associated with it

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Like the TVs

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
Were responsible for 66%

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Of home energy use

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
From gaming in 2016

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
So going back to what I was saying

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
The Microsoft and Sony

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Have been

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Definitely challenged

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
There was a

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
A conference

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
I'm trying to get the name again

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
Because like I said this is a big article

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
But they were challenged

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
By

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
In the UN's Playing for Planet

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Alliance to create

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
825,000

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Carbon neutral

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
Xbox One X consoles

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
Which would be under 2%

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Of all consoles made

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
But every little bit helps

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
But they're trying

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
They're also wanting to

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Make them

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
More carbon neutral by buying

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
High quality carbon offsets

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Sony announced on March 18th

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Mark Cerny who's the lead systems architect

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
On the PS5

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Did not make

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
A single mention

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
Of energy draw or the environmental

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
Impact

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
The only thing we have about this

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Comes from Jim Ryan

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
The present CEO of Sony

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Interactive Entertainment

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Who said that they would be able to

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
Suspend gameplay with much

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Lower power consumption

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
And that if 1 million users

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Enable this feature it would save the equivalent

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
To average electricity use

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
Of 1,000 US homes

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
And

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Nintendo however

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
They

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
I mean Switch uses a

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Bunch less energy than the other systems

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Lower processing power

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
And graphic fidelity for one thing

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
Results

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
In less energy

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
Consumption

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
They're focused on

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Better games

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
Even if they don't have that

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
Hardware

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
The size of those things

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
They practically run off a rechargeable battery

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
So it's kind of inherently built in

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
And even a solid three hours

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
Of playing using the handheld mode

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
It does not get hot

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
And that's kind of one thing

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
I was curious about is that

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
I don't know if it's going to be realistic to say

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Oh we shouldn't have Playstation 5

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Or Xbox Series X

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Maybe there's better things they could do in the manufacturing

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
Process like you kind of brought up there with some of the

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
Carbon free consoles

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
But I wonder if there aren't maybe small measures

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
We can take on the consumer side

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
And you kind of brought one up there that maybe

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
There's a thing you can enable there to use

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
The lower power consumption in the background

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
Maybe our consoles don't

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Necessarily have to be always on

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
I know it's very convenient to have

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
The patch downloads and things like that

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
I know my Xbox One started making weird noises

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
So I kind of like

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
I unplug it completely when I'm not using it

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
And then I'll plug it in

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
An hour before I plan on using it

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
To do any patch downloads and things like that

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
But maybe that's a thing

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
I don't know

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
I'm not saying everybody has to do it my way

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
But maybe there's things consumers can do

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
To cut back on some of that energy usage

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
There's a little bit more

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
There is

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
Clark Stacey again, the head of WildWorks

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Has

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Called out a few different things

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
For example, I'm going a little bit more

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Into cloud

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
Networking for data

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
Saves for games for all that

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Type of thing

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
And the fact that the data centers require a huge amount

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Of energy pooling systems

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
That make it run 24 hours a day

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
Forever

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
And actually this is a different quote by Adele Tousie

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Who's a data engineer at Monash University

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
A typical cloud data center consumes as much energy

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
As 25,000 households

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
And Clark Stacey

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
Who I mentioned earlier goes on to say

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
That Google and Apple are leading the way

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
Basically saying that since the data centers

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
Are 100% powered by renewable energy

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Then

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
This actually requires

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
The companies that use renewable energy

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
To invest in renewable energy

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
For the open market

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Ubisoft

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
Has gone 99%

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
Which has

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
Basically

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Had them to release

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
Far less

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Carbon dioxide

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Into the atmosphere

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
But the thing is

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
That a lot of these other groups

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Are using

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Cloud-based services

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Or even their own

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
I'm trying to think of

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Just general

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Operations

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
If they could

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
Lower that impact

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
That's how data centers

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
Make up

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
They actually could make up

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
Approximately 60% of all energy uses

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
In communication by 2025

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
So

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
We really need to be pushing them

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
Into

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
Using

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
Cleaner energy

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Into

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
Finding renewable resources

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
And this has to start top down

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
But the thing is

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
They're not really having

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
The ability

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
For

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
Climate change

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Based on

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Their current operation status

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
They're not really having too much

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
Of an incentive

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
Other than

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
The public

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
Poking back at them

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
But

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
If they

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
We also need companies

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
Take to

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
EA

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
They haven't put any

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
Type of

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Report on their emissions

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Or their energy usage

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
And

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
Microsoft when their spokespeople did

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
Submit a disability

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Sony and Nintendo did not

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
Respond to a request for comment

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
But

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
And of course we have all of our

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Handhelds too

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
And some of the big companies

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
Are innovating and jumping the gun

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
On getting the

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Emissions reduced

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
And making things with more

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
Renewable

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
I think now a lot of

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
Computers and

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
Handheld devices

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
Made from recycled material

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
So that's good but we need

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
To hold people's assets to the

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Fire

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
And I think awareness

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Is probably a big component of this

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
And one thing that we probably need

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Our gaming media, our gaming press

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
To do is now that we know

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
Where these things are coming from

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
Cloud gaming is the future but at what

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
Cost as you point out there

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
We need our people that have access

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
To be able to interview these folks

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
To ask these questions. This doesn't have to be done in a

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
Punitive or a negative way but

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
This cloud gaming sounds great but

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
What are you doing to ensure that there's

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
No harm to the planet from it or what are you doing

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
To get back on these. We need these people

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
To ask those because unfortunately

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
We could say here on our little podcast

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
And say those types of things and think about

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
The things that we could do maybe a little more

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Directly but we're not gonna

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Realistically be able to really affect the change

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
The way that people that have more direct access

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
Have the ability to do that

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
If that makes sense. Like I was saying it has to start top down

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
You know but

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
You know we can also

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
I'm sorry but I'm really surprised on Microsoft

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
Side of things especially I know Bill Gates

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
Doesn't run it anymore and in fact Bill Gates isn't even

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Involved with the board anymore but I'm just

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
Surprised with him kind of being the legacy

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Of Microsoft and everything. Him and his

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Foundations on the planet. I'm really surprised

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
They're not at the forefront of this

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
Which they ought to be

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
Microsoft has really been

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
I mean they're late to the game in terms of

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
Environmental viability

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
Other companies have really

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
Been doing a lot better than them

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
I mean I think

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
That will and here was what the exam

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
Say and

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
This actually brings our current pandemic

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
Into things. Look at how

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
Much these places

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Around us have cleaned up

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Without

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
The level of energy

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
And material and

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
Being put out

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
If we can get companies

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
To do you know

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
To what's the lack of a

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
Better description to

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
To have that same kind of

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Control to keep things isolated

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
To you know using

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
This renewable resource keep them

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
Using recycled materials

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
To you know put pressure on

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
The government for example

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
To find cleaner ways

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Of shipping

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
You know games and all of that we can

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
Really really make

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
Such a big impact. You know piggybacking

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
On that a little bit this is this is the hottest of

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
Hot takes but some would say

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
That you know and I don't know if it's right

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
Or wrong take it or leave it but some would say that

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
The pandemic and what's happening

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
Is in this I guess

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
This depends on what you believe in in science over this is

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
This is earth's response

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
To the humans living on it not

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
Responding to climate

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
Change. You know I mean when you see that

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
Direct impact that you know

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
The pandemic kind of isolating people in their homes

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
Or this having on the climate you know

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
Some would say that is the earth healing

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
Itself. At least it's not

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
The happening yeah right

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
So anyway I know that's I know that

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Is the hottest of takes but it is it's one of those

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Things that makes you go hmm

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Yeah and you know what and there's

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Also this thing going on oh

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
This is you know

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
I don't think it's people that

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
Are the virus I think that

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
Is people's decisions

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
We all have to be

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
Able to

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
And now I'm going to be getting into a bit more broad

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
Outside of video games but we all have to look

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
At what our personal impact is

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
And we have to make good on it

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
You know and I'm not talking about

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Oh straight

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
Fuck that that whole thing was ableist as fuck

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
But I mean we have to

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
Look at the companies that we are

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Shopping from and what they are doing

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
And the fact that our money is supporting their bullshit

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
You know

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
We have to we have to find this

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
We have

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
People accountable and we have to

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
You know and speaking

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Of top down in this country

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
We have to fucking start with top down

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Alright

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
So things don't shape up

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
Yeah you guys are both cutting in and out

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
I thought it was maybe just my wi-fi

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
And to my phone

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Okay oh boy alright

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
So what I said is I said if

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Things don't start shaping up

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
We're going to have to start bombing makeup

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
I think he's making a Final Fantasy 7

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
Remake joke

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
Oh yeah let's go hit Shinra

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
And run the balls

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
I definitely want to read this comment

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Sorry no Bobby

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
It's not the new noise cancelling

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
Because I specifically said before the show

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Don't turn that on until we have a chance to play with it

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
It's not the new noise cancelling

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
I didn't even know it existed so I didn't touch it

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
Yeah

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
VG Realness in Chat says

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
I feel like some gaming press is afraid to ask the hard

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Questions for fear of not getting early releases

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
A big basket of bullshit in this industry

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
I mean it's not even about this climate

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Change thing which I mean is certainly something

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
But I mean it's a whole thing

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Where it's like we've known for

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
Some time that you know outlets who

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
Don't ask the hard questions get

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
They get their hands slapped

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
And you know unfortunately

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
As Darkstalk was talking about some things are from the top

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
Down and when you see the same type

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Of thing happening at the highest of offices

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
In North America

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Or excuse me in the United States

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
I don't know what to say

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
Anyway

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
I also want to respond to pod culture

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
To Brad

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
Digital only is pretty damn clean

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
But going back to the thing

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
In that CNET article I was going off of

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
Bear in mind that

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
It takes energy for the downloads

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
It takes energy to host

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
The digital copies

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
We're getting back into the cloud services

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
And those cloud services use a ton of energy

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
Unless they are doing a lot more to offset it

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
So even though it might be less physical waste

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
Which certainly would be a thing

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Again there might still be a trade off

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
For that so anyway

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
And some folks in chat just kind of like breaking news

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
Folks in chat are saying playstation network

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Is apparently down right now

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
So I wonder if there isn't a whole thing going on with the internet

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
And I thought maybe it was just me

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
Because for those that don't know

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
How things are wired

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
I actually have two accounts

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
On discord so I have one account

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
That strictly is on the wired

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
Connection and it also feeds in

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
My microphone and the mixing board

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
And so it kind of mixes everything with them on discord

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
And then the way I listen to them

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
So that you don't hear the feedback

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
Is I am in on my own personal account

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
On this wifi on my phone

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
That's why I've been wearing headphones

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
Ever since we started doing the

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Social distance episodes of OLR

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
So I thought maybe my wifi was cutting in

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
And out so I was just kind of

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
Because I was watching the meters and they didn't seem to be dropping

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
But apparently it's a weird internet issue going on

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
So I don't know what's up

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
So sorry guys but we're doing our best

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Wish we could all be in the same room but it is what it is

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
And as I said I was going to put

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
Because like I said there's a bunch more

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
In this article

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
So I posted it on

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
My own account

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
So

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
If you want to read up on it

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
And look at what you can do

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Then

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
I'd say give it a look over

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
See what needs to be

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Done who needs to be talked to

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
And hold their asses to the fire

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Alright

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
I have spoken

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Alright well on that note Dark Soccer I know you need to take off

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
So any final thoughts

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Or last thoughts for our listeners tonight before you take off

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
Send me chocolate

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
Like legit

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
No one guessed my fucking favorite chocolate by the way

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
So it's

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
Vosages

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
It's the stout chocolate

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
I require many bars of this

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Sent to my house, message me for details

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
And that is very true

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Because every time I go to Chicago where they have a lot of it

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
That's what I bring back Dark Soccer

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
When she's doing the kitty sitting

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
I can find by the way

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
The bars at the nugget

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
But I cannot get those delicious truffles

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
Yeah those are harder to find

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Alright

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
And I love you for it, love love love heart heart heart

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Alright take care Dark Soccer

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
And we'll see you next week

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
Be well, be safe

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
You stupid people stay in your house

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
Alright

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
Let's move on to our mail bag

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Participate at orangetontrader.com

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
It's the place where you can send us an email every week

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
We got one quick email tonight

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
This is from Robert M

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
Who emailed us to say

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
I haven't heard it discussed but after four years

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
WayForward released their formerly Humble Bundle

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
Subscription exclusive

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
Cat Girl Without Salad

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
Appropriately on April 1st

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
They will be getting repeated over multiple plays

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
At the few levels

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
Might not be worth the $9 for everybody

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
But a fun distraction between New Horizons sessions

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
$9 is really really low price though

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
And thank you for the email

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Appreciate that

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
And just based on the title

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
It sounds like something I want to check out

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
The problem is

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
And for me this is a big problem with the Switch overall

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
It's great that they have a lot of games

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
But their eShop doesn't handle that avalanche of games

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Very well

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
It's not like

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
Steam

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
Even Steam is starting to buckle under the weight

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
It's not very easy to explore and find things

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
Because I had no idea about this game

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
Until you send an email

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
So I think the best thing you can do

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
When you have a little indie game

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
That you like like this

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
Help spread the word

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
And I say it at the end of every Orange Launch Radio

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Because it's true for us as an indie podcast

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
We're never going to get the types of views

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
That IGN Podcast

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
GameSpot Podcast

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
Or employees that formerly worked for those organizations

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Having their own podcast

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
We're not going to have those types of numbers

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Because we don't have that

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
So the best thing you can do for us

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
Is help us spread the word

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
And the same thing is true of these indie Switch titles

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
Because even though they're on the Switch

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
They don't have Nintendo's name on them

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
So spread the word

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
That's why I like to do that for YYR

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
We have a small audience here at Orange Launch Radio

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
But I like to pimp YYR's games

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
They're pretty good and I think people should see them

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
Especially, especially super multitasking

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
It blows my mind that that game has not gone viral

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
But you know, you gotta spread the word

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
Tell people about the products you love

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
So I will say this Robert M

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
You are doing the right thing

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
When it comes to how to spread the word

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
For finding those games on the marketplace

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
And I will check that out, Catgirl Without Salad

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:29.000
Spreading the word by streaming games

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
Is a big one as well

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:37.000
Do you want to rob Robert's super hot take, Loki?

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
Do you want a really unpopular super hot take

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
About streaming games?

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
Yeah

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
I think, and this is my opinion

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
And I'm speaking of no other streamer

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
Or no other watcher other than myself

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:55.000
I think it is a bad idea to stream Final Fantasy 7 Remake right now

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Because I don't think narrative video games like that

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
Make for very good streams

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
Because if you drop in and out

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
You're either gonna be spoiling yourself on the story

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
For the game you hope to be playing

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
Or you're gonna be dropping in on something

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
Where you didn't see the whole few hours

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
Leading up to this particular point

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:17.000
And I just, there's a reason why I kind of stop streaming those types of games

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
Because I'm not sure it's always like

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
It's not really what I enjoy either

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
I don't necessarily like all the personalities

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
That I do see streaming some of these games

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
Kind of like doing their own voice acting

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
Doing their own voice acting

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
Or doing their own thing on top of this

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
Like I just don't think narrative games like that

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
Make for very good streams

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
On the flip side, I think Animal Crossing

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
And those more like evergreen games

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
That are meant for user created content

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
I think they're great games to stream

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
And I think that's why games like

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
Minecraft and like a lot of things

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
That are very like user, Stardew Valley

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
I think that's why those games have tended

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
To do very well on Twitch in the past

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
Because I think those streams are better

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
They also do a lot of creative things

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
Oddly enough so like

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
My kids watch a ton of Minecraft streams

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
And Roblox stuff and all that

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
I've started to watch more of those now

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
And it's because it's not necessarily

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
That it's just, it's vanilla playing Minecraft

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:13.000
They do interesting things with it

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
Like for example, one I watched the other day

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:19.000
It was two players trying to speedrun Minecraft

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
While they have a terminator after them

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
And the terminator is basically

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
A AI bot that just hunts them down

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
And while they're playing it

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
And that made it interesting

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
They have a person

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
One person trying to speedrun the game

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
And beat it, the other one has a compass

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
That points to where the other person is

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
And they're trying to stop them

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
From beating the game

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
And so those are fun

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
Or like some of the

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
Ultimate hardcore stuff that they do

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
Or like

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
Deathmatch stuff are pretty fun

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
They can mix it up

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
And of course my hot take

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
Is getting a lot of comments in chat

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
See what happens when you don't send emails

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
That's gonna happen now

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
You're gonna get a Rob Roberts really super hot take

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
Maybe it'll be on Drag Race, maybe not

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
So some comments here

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
That it's generating here

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
Bobby Blackwell says I only stream narrative games

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
If they were on MS-DOS in the 90s

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
And again, I'm not calling any single person out

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
And myself, I was streaming

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
Ni No Kuni 2 when it first came out

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
And then I kind of realized by the time I got to

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
Part 4 or 5

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
If you didn't see Part 1

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
Why would you come watch Parts 4 and 5

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
And that's why

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
When I see the tweets that are like

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
Come watch my Nier

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
Nier Automata was when I was looking for videos

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
Because I love the soundtracks

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
And I would see these videos that come up on the side

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
Watch my Nier Automata Part 23 playthrough

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
And I'm like girl

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
If I didn't watch Part 1

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
I ain't gonna watch Part 23

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
But if all your streaming is Part 1

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
I think that's different

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
And that's what kind of Bobby gets

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
So when you're doing the MS-DOS game in the 90s

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
I feel like you usually do that first

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
And then that's usually it

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
And that's kind of where it gets

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
Those first couple hours types of things

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
Yeah, if I streamed Final Fantasy 7 Remake

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
It would just be the beginning of the game

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
Exactly, that's different

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
That's a good little sample of the game

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
And then you're not getting too far into it

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
But I'm not gonna

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
And this is any streamer I'm following

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
And I love you guys, I love the community and so forth

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
But if you're streaming Final Fantasy 7 Remake right now

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
I'm not gonna visit your channel

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
Because you might be further along than I am

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
And I don't wanna be spoiled

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
It's just as simple as that

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
VGRealness says say their names

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
Everybody

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
Everybody is guilty, I've been guilty of it

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
You've been guilty of it

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
I'm calling out the planet

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
Let's see

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
I'm dragging everybody today

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
Says SSG100Matt

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
Questbuster says

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
I'll watch some classic game streams

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
Where no one says a thing

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
But because I love the gamer I'm really curious about retro

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
I'll stick with it

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
Again, different strokes for different folks

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
Again, I'm not saying you shouldn't watch these streams

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
You should actually, because I don't want to

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
So somebody should be

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
Supporting these streams

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
But I just think

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
It isn't the most compelling content

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
To be streaming narrative games

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
Part 23

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
That's all I'm gonna say

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
Alright

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
BobbyBlackWolf

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
I'm laughing because of the comments in chat

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
BobbyBlackWolf says Rob's being affected by Mako

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
I keep wanting to say Mako, but now we've learned it's Mako

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
Rob's being affected by the Mako

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
The planet is crying out in pain and he's mad

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
Yeah, I'm mad

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
Alright, let's move on

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
Loki, quick, change the subject before I get another

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
hot take out there that gets me in trouble

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
So we should stream this too

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Because it's going to be pretty fun

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
No, I don't want to get cancelled

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
So the

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
LEGO Super Mario sets

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
They're going to be launching

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
August

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
They of course announced this

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
A few weeks ago

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
So now we have

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Some pricing and what exactly

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
So I don't think it's

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
Necessarily too expensive

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
But the

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
Starter set, a $60 adventure

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
With Mario's starter course

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Yeah, $60

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
If you pre-order it, you also get

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
A little

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
It's called Super Mushroom

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
And Monty Mole

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
So it's like a little collector's thing that you can

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
Get as well to add some more stuff

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
To that

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
I'm not sure if you'll be able to

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
I think they've stopped taking pre-orders

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
Because it's already been so popular

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
So there's that

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
And then they showed off some new sets

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
Piranha Plant

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
It looks like a little seesaw thing

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
With two piranha plants on it

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
And that's $30

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
And then of course the Bowser's Castle

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
Boss Battle expansion

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
Which is $100

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
When you're talking about Lego prices

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
That's not too bad

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
Not a lot of pieces though

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
But then again

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
The Mario's

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
The character itself

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
Is very sophisticated with these

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
A voice

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
And everything like that

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
So I can understand how that might be a bit more expensive

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
The Bowser's Castle thing looks pretty awesome though

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
I gotta say

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
Yeah, those Legos

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
As expensive as they are, what else is new with Lego?

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
They look so cool

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
Honestly

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
Sign me up

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
Uncle Sam's sending me $2400

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Why not blow it on Legos?

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
I'm sorry

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
I should but

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
You know there's lots of people thinking it

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
Like

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
What dumb shit

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
Am I gonna spend that

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
And I shouldn't make a lie because a lot of people really need that

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
For very serious things

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
But there are a lot of other people that are like

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
I should spend that money on Legos

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
Why not?

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
Anyway

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
Pixel pockets in chat says

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
I want the Bowser set

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
Let's see

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
They're talking about the ability to post gifts in the chat

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
And I'm like yes I'm all for that

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
You should be able to post gifts

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
But Loki are you gonna buy the Legos and do some building?

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
Probably

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
Same

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
Big same

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
Let's move on and talk about

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
What's going on in the chat

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
What's going on in the chat

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
What's going on in the chat

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
What's going on in the chat

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
What's going on in the chat

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
What's going on in the chat

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
What's going on in the chat

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
What's going on in the chat

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
What's going on in the chat

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
What's going on in the chat

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
What's going on in the chat

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
What's going on in the chat

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
What's going on in the chat

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
Just wanted to know whether Blizzcon 2020 will be feasible

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
They have a lot of their own employees

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
In fact I think all their employees are working at home right now

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
At Blizzard

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
I mean certainly there's a whole side of event planning there

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
So those folks are still

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
Event planning

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
Because

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
They would rather

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
Plan something and have to cancel it

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
Than not have planned it at all

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
And find out

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
Miraculously we have a cure by the summer

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
I know

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
That's probably not realistic and I shouldn't even say that

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
But you know you always cross your fingers and your toes

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
Maybe something will come through

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
But anyhow Blizzard does acknowledge

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
That it could be several months before they know

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
If they're going to be forced to cancel Blizzcon or not

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
And that's the case with everything in the fall right now

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
Like early on in this process

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
It was definitely like

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
DragonCon, Blizzcon

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
FanFest, all those things that happen in the fall

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
We'll be fine, this will be over by the fall

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
And now the longer that this goes on

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
They talk more about the curve

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
The potential second waves

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
And we don't necessarily have all the answers

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
We don't really know

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
Is it going to be safe for all those nerds

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
Who don't always take a shower

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
To be crammed together

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
In the Anaheim Convention Center

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
That might not be a good idea actually

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
So

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
We don't know yet

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
We just don't know and neither does Blizzard

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
And so we'll have more information on that

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
In the coming months

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
But there is going to come a point

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
Where there is a go or no go

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
Like there is going to come a point where

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
They have to make their decision

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
So we'll see what's talking

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
Do you think they would try to do like a digital only event

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
And money?

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
I'm sure Blizzard would do a digital only event

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
Would they charge money for it?

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
That's a very good question

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
Because Blizzcon

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
Well, but Blizzcon is also all of their

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
Championship games

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
And if they can't really do that

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
I guess they could just do it via distance

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
I'm not sure

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Like Hearthstone you could probably do that way

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
But I'm not sure you could do things like

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
Heroes of the Storm or Mythic Dungeon

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
That's like 5 people or Overwatch

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
I'm not sure you could do all those as easy

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
So I wouldn't rule it out

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
But yeah

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
It's not necessarily

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
Going to happen either

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
Sia Tabiri in chat says

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
I hope more comedians start doing Zoom shows

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
This is a big thing in the

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
Drag community actually too

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
There's a lot of drag kings

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
I know a lot of drag kings locally

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
That

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
Are doing their own shows on Instagram

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
And actually

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
I don't want to say who it is

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
But I actually follow a drag queen

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
On social media

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
And I actually chatted with them

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
And it's one of the Rugerolls

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
So you know who they are

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
That wants to start doing a Twitch stream

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
And so I was giving them

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
Like I was talking to them about

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
Oh well good news so do I

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
And I was telling them about how to download OBS

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
And all that stuff so we'll see if they actually do it

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
Because I think a lot of people really like

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
The Twitch bits system

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
As being able to donate and tip

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
And some of that stuff on demand

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
So a lot of drag queens are looking at Twitch

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
As the ability to do that

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
And so you know put any artist

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
You might kind of roll your eyes

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
Oh there's Rob talking about drag queens again

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
But where that goes comedians

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
And other types of artists

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
Really follow especially the longer

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
That this goes on

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
That's for sure

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
Yeah VGRealnessInChat says

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
That must be really hard without audience feedback

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
Or immediate feedback I should say

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
It is weird watching

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
Like even some of the late

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
The late night shows?

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
Yeah watching the audience

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
Normally laughing and stuff like that

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
Having their jokes without any of that

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
It's a little weird

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
I did watch some of the Saturday Night Live

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
And it was weird

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
Yeah I mean I appreciate that they did it

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
And they tried it but it was a little weird

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
But again for Twitch's benefit

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
When it comes to those types of performances

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
They have the chat room

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
So they are getting that stuff

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
I mean it might not be the actual audio laughter

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
But they do get their ha ha ha's

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
And their lol's and their emote icon spams

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
In real time and at least it shows them

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
Oh somebody's out there I'm not just talking to myself

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
And that goes a long way

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
Anybody that's done streaming before knows

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
Even though you still need to stream

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
Even when nobody's watching

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
And you need to act like the world's watching

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
It does sure feel a lot better

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
And rewarding when even one person

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
Is there saying hi

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
Oh lol or you know even this littlest thing

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
Will kind of like give you that motivation

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
To keep going for a long time

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
So anyway

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
Let's move on

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
So we already talked about the climate story

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
DarkSakura did that before she left

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
So let's go to Loki with our next story

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
Yeah so this is kind of cool

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
So you've been seeing a lot of company

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
Loki you're cutting out so bad

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
I don't know if there's even anything we can do about it

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
What I'm going to try to do

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
I'm going to reestablish your connection here

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
Can you just hang up on the channel

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
And come right back to reestablish your connection

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
Literally turn it off and then on again

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
It's the first thing I want to try

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
See if that helps

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
Because I don't know about you guys but it's very bad

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
Okay try again Loki

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
Alright

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
How's that? So far so good

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
Cool

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
Yeah I think there's just internet issues

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
And there's mosquitoes in the house

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
Okay

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
So anyways

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
So you have different companies actually stepping up

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
To build

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
Ventilators and one of those now is actually

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
A PC company of course

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
Main Gear

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
Who does a lot of different cases and whatnot

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
And so they're actually building

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
A ventilator called the Liv

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
And it's basically

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
It looks like it's built out of one of their old cases

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
But

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
It's a complex

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
Oxygen delivery system

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
With a touch screen interface

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
And they say it can supply

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
Oxygen in 1.5 seconds

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
So pretty awesome that they're

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
Going to be manufacturing that

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
They said

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
It can be manufactured at a scale

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
At a quarter of the price of traditional

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
Ventilators

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
Though it's pending FDA approval

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
But looks neat

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
I hope those sorts of things

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
Like FDA approval don't take so

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
Long that by the time they're able to do it

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
It doesn't matter anymore you know

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
Yeah I think a lot of that stuff is kind of relaxed a little bit

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
Because of the pandemic situation

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
But

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
I have a feeling that

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
The process will be a little bit quicker

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
And not to get like political

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Or too off topic but I kind of think

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
These guys are getting ahead of the curve

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
Because I think what's going to happen

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
Is I think they are going to

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
I think they are going to invoke

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
That defense act or whatever it's called

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
And they're going to force more companies

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
To be creating things like tests

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
And ventilators and things to help

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
I'm kind of surprised it hasn't already happened

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
But I think they're going to force a lot more companies

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
To make these things in mass

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
So that we can have the appropriate level

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
Of response I really think that's

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
How this ends

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
Or not how it ends but how

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
We have a path to normalcy

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
I'll put it that way

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
But we'll see again I'm not a politician

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
That's just my tinfoil hat talking

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
But to bring it back to games

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
As you're seeing in this particular story

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
Game makers are not necessarily

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
Immune from that type of order

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
Right? So

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
I just ordered PC parts actually

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
Because my computer has been doing this weird

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
Like locking up thing lately

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
And I was like you know what I just want to buy new parts anyway

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
I actually got a new graphics card and I'm surprised

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
A. I was able to find one

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
And B. it got here as fast as it did

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
Because I was quoted the end of the month

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
For the card to get here and it showed up yesterday

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
So I was like alright I'll take it

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
But

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
I have a new graphics card for my games I'm really excited

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
Alright

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
That's cool? Yeah

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
Alright let's move on

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
Last story here before we get to

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
I think we are going to try to take calls tonight

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
Because somebody told me they wanted to call in

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
And I really wanted to hear from this person

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
So I was like alright not that I don't

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
I was like okay alright you know what I need to try to get

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
The discord call thing working again

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
So we're going to try to do it tonight

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
And video we need to do video too

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
Yeah we need to get video running again

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
I didn't think this would be for that long

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
So I wasn't going to force that issue

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
But here we are

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
So yeah that'll probably be a thing that comes

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
Just don't rush me

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
Alright if you want to call into the show

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
Join the green room

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
We'll get some folks here on the show

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
So get in the green room just like always

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
We're hiding in a different channel but go to the green room

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
And I'll still put you in the place you need to be

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
Alright

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
For now let's talk about a 35 year old bug

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
That's been patched

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
Or at least that's the way it's being reported

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
Although I'm not so sure I draw the same conclusion

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
However

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
An admin and a writer at the cutting room floor website

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
Which is a really cool website by the way

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
But the admin Gold S has released a patch

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
For Super Mario Brothers

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
Yes the 35 year old game on the Nintendo Entertainment System

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
That will change Lakitu's behavior

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
In saying in a quote

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
The spiny eggs are thrown by Lakitu

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
In a simple way

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
With no horizontal movement whatsoever

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
However

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
This is not the intended behavior

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
And is actually the result of a bug

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
The eggs are supposed to be thrown out

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
Relative to the player's speed

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
Lakitu's speed, the player's position

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
And a pseudo random value

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
As well as bounce off any blocks

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
Or walls that they hit on the way down

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
So how the heck did he find that this was a bug

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
He's just kind of assuming this was a bug

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
Right

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
But apparently when looking at the code

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
It was kind of one of those things where it's like

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
The code is in here but it wasn't really calling on it

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
Da da da da da

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
So that's where this patch came from

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
I'm really oversimplifying but I gotta try and keep this short

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
But

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
One could also argue

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
How many times has this game been re-released

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
At this point

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
We had the Wii version

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
We had the Super Mario All-Stars

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
We had the Game Boy Advance

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
We had the Game Boy Color

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
This game has come out again a fucking lot of times

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
And did they ever change it?

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
No

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
So was it truly a bug

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
Or was it one of those things where it's like

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
We just accepted that this is the way it is

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
And so we're not going to change it

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
I think that maybe they just didn't want to fix it

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
Because that's how it's always played

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
And it would be weird if we changed something

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
But it is interesting

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
And Dr. Suya says I just thought this was neat

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
Oh no, don't get me wrong, it is neat

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
And I'm not saying anything bad

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
Or mean against the person that found it

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
I do think it's neat, I do think it's cool

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
And it is just an interesting

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
It is an interesting relic of

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
We can't really patch the old games

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
So

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
Even though I'm saying maybe it just

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
It just kind of became accepted as the norm

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
It's interesting to think

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
Because Nintendo could not fix it

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
Did that just become embraced as the norm

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
Lakitu's behavior and that's why it was never

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
Fixed in a later release

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
That might really be the reason

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
We'll never know

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
But if Super Mario Brothers were released today

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
They could fix it

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
I mean that's what they do with Animal Crossing

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
So Nintendo can fix things

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
They can patch things, they do it all the time now

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
So it's just interesting

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
YYR in chat says do we know for a fact

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
That this was never changed in later versions

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
They did make at least some changes

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
In later versions

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
Specifically

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
Like All Stars

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
I'm sorry, specifically Lakitu's behavior

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
No, is not

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
Different

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
There's a great little side by side comparison

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
If you want to look at news stories on this

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
I was looking at an article at RetroRGB.com

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
That had this article

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
I think this was actually linked in our Discord

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
Because I know I stole a lot of stories from our Discord tonight

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
So thank you all to the Discord community

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
Over at vognetwork.com

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
Where I do borrow stories

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
Especially on news weeks

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
Where everybody's in quarantine

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
So the companies aren't always putting out news

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
At the same length

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
But anyway, I'm looking at this

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
And there's a nice little gif or a video here on the page

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
That actually shows the before and after behavior

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
And you definitely see in the after

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
You see how the eggs have more of an arc

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
More of a curvature

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
To the way they're thrown

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
Whereas in the normal game they just kind of go

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
They kind of just plop down

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
And you kind of outrun them in the normal game

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
Whereas with the arcing

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
It makes it a lot harder. You have to actually dodge them quite a bit

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
It does, it does. It's interesting

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
It's interesting

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
SSJ100Matt in chat says, Miyamoto is willing to fix it

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
But you have to put in a support ticket and he has to be billed

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
At his regular rate from 1985

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
I don't know about that

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
I don't know

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
I wonder how often

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
He gets in there and programs things anymore

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
I don't know. Alright

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
Let's get to some calls

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
I see a couple folks in the green room

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
So let's try this out and we'll see how it goes

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
Hello, you're on Orange Sounds Radio. Who's this?

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
Hello, it's Delvin from VG Realness

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
What a surprise to hear from you

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
Hi Delvin

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Don't act like it's a surprise

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
I just missed hearing from you

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
I missed talking to you

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
And I just, I missed the world

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
The way it used to be, but how are you?

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
I'm doing great

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
I've been enjoying

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
The hell out of Final Fantasy 7

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
Which is what I'm here for

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
To talk about

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
Okay, before I let you talk about that, can I just say

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
Because I had to say

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
You came out here to visit and you were on an episode of OLR

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
Like a year and a half ago, right?

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
And I keep saying, I'm gonna go to Toronto

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
I'm gonna return the favor, I'm gonna go to Toronto

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
Last year I couldn't go

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
Because I ended up changing jobs

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
Right in the midst of that

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
And so I didn't have any time off, I couldn't do it

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
So this year I was all gung-ho about going

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
And then, womp womp, pandemic

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
Toronto Pride gets cancelled

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
And now the gag is

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
You're not even gonna be in Toronto much longer, right?

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
Well, who knows at this point

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
I guess that's true

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
Anyway, so I just

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
Yeah, it's just one of those running jokes

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
I'll go visit Delbert and return eventually

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
But anyway

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
In the meantime, you've been playing Final Fantasy 7

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
Yes, I have been playing it

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
And let me just preface this by saying

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
I had to take a phone call

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
Right at the moment when you started talking about it

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
So if I'm repeating anything that you said earlier, I apologize

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
Repeat away

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
I've been enjoying the game a lot

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
And I have a different perspective

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
On the game that I don't know that

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
Many people do

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
Is that I didn't play the original

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
Not by

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
A choice

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
I tried to play the first one

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
And I had a little brother

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
And anyone who has a little brother

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
May have also experienced this issue

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
They like to delete save files

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
Off from your games

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
It doesn't matter what it is

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
It could be a game that they don't even play

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
They would just go and delete your save file

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
I don't know why

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
But he did this multiple times

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
When I had it on PlayStation

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
And then I said, okay fine, forget it

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
I'm gonna play it on PC

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
So then I started it on PC

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
Way back when it was

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
98 or whenever

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
Yep

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
And then my computer crashed

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
So I lost the save file again

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
So I said, you know what?

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
This is just not meant to be

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
And I just never played it

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
Because I was like

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
I can't play disc one anymore

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
God is sending a message

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
Message received

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
Yes, message received

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
I'm not to play this game

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
So I left it alone

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
So anyway, here I am now playing this game

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
And it's really good

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
And the battles

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
Are really seamless

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
Honestly

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
This game feels like

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
This is maybe how they wanted

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
Final Fantasy 15 to feel

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
And what they were

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
Going for but didn't quite hit the

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
Mark because they ran out of time

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
But the battle

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
System just feels very fluid

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
And I mean in 15, yes it was

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
But this is just like perfected

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
At this point

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
So totally really good

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
But what really has me

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
Irritated is

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
The fans

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
Of Final Fantasy

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
And the haters

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
Get her Jade

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
I don't know

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
Where this hatred

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
And vitriol is coming from

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
For some people

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
Some of the comments I'm seeing online

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
Is that, oh you're paying $60

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
To replay something in better

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
Graphics just to pay another

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
$60 for some quote unquote

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
DLC when and

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
If it arrives. So some people

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
Are even going as far to say

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
Oh well Square's not even going to finish

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
The game. They're only going to release

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
One and maybe two and then not even

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
Release the completed

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
Product. And

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
I don't even understand where

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
That comment comes from. Why they

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
Would leave that money

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
On the table to not finish it

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
A fundamental misunderstanding

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
That this is not the same product

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
Anymore. That's

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
The other thing

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
Again I haven't played the original

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
So I don't know but just going on

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
Comments and things from

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
People who have played the game such as yourself

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
And other friends

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
This is not disc

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
One as it was

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
In its original game

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
Which is what a lot of people

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
Are making the comparison. A lot of people are saying

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
Oh it's just disc one in

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
Better graphics and

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
That's not what really is being put here

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
And then there's gamers who have

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
This purest attitude

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
Towards the game and saying

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
They don't want to buy the game until

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
It's completed

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
Because they feel it's incomplete or it's not long enough

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
And my argument

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
Towards that is

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
A lot of people are saying

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
Okay the game is only 30 to 40 hours

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
It's not long enough so it's not justifiable

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
To have the $60 price tag

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
$80 if you live in Canada

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
But whatever

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
And the way games

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
Are going today

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
Games are generally 30 to 40 hours

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
Long and

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
You know for those

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
Diehard RPG fans which I am

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
A diehard RPG person as well

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
We have to really think

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
And consider what was a 100 hour

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
RPG game back in the day

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
Was it really

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
100 hours worth of story

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
Or

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
Was at least a minimum

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
Of 40% of that time

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
So 40 hours of that gameplay

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
Grinding

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
Replaying dungeons

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
Over and over killing things

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
Over and over and over and over

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
To make the game feel like it's

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
100 hours

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
I mean

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
Don't get me wrong there are some games that

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
I truly enjoy that

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
But I don't want the game to be

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
100 hours

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
Quote unquote

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
Just and then

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
Making me have to grind

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
To make the game artificially feel

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
Longer just so RPG purists

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
Can be like oh yeah I can

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
Buy this game now because it's 60

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
It's 100 hours

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
And I don't know about your impression of what you've played so far

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
But for me like when you are in that main

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
Story this game has you

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
By the balls and does not let go

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
Like you are like it is intense

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
Maybe when you're doing side quests

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
And stuff you get a little bit of a cool down period

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
But like god you need it

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
Like

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
Let me have a nap for a minute

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000
There's a lot going on

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
Like I mean I'm not like

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
Super like

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
Pro at like you know games and there were

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
Some battles where I like I died

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
Are you playing on normal or easy?

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
I'm playing on normal

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
Oh okay well that's to be expected

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
Yeah there were some battles I

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
I died and

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
It also goes against

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
That old school RPG mentality

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
Like I really think to get through

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
Normal mode even you have to

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
Use potions and high potions

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
Whereas like in the old Final Fantasy games

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
We would stockpile that shit

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
Like I got 99 potions in my inventory

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
I might need them I might need them

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
No you are never going to use those potions

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
Because you never do

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
The remake

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
So my number one advice to you

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
Delvin on those

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
Use the fucking potions

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
Oh honey

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
Honey

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
She is buying the potions

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
She is hitting the vendors

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
When they're on sale

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
Oh this merchant has it on sale

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
I'm buying them

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
I'm buying all of them

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
Trust and believe

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
All of them

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
But yeah it's crazy

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
I don't know where this attitude

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
Is coming from from people about this game

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
They want it to be a hundred hour

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
Experience

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
They don't feel like it's long enough

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
And I just really wish that people would put that thought

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
Out of their minds

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
This not being a complete game

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
You know and by that same

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
Thought you know

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
Do we look at movie trilogies as incomplete

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
You know like the Avengers

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
Whole movie saga

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
Do we just

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
We know more of it's coming

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
So I'm not going to go and watch

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
Captain America

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
Because I know it's not a complete movie

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
It's going to continue

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
That's just a bad attitude

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
You used the same argument I used on somebody on Twitter this week

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
Which is somebody I like a lot

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
So I don't want to make it sound like I'm fighting him

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
Or I'm cutting him down

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
But somebody whose opinion I value

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
Replied to one of my tweets and said

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
Well I don't really want to play the Final Fantasy 7 remake

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
Until the whole thing is available

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
And I just replied and I said

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
You know you got to do what's best for you

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
I said but I hope by that logic

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
You didn't watch any of the Harry Potter movies

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
Until all eight of them were out

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
Well I mean yeah

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
I don't know it just doesn't make sense to me

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
Some of these comments

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
That are being made that I'm seeing on Facebook

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
And social media

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
It's just unfounded

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
And what I will also say

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
One last thing

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
Is that

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
What Square is doing here

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
I would really like to see them

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
Go back and give this kind of refresh

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
On some of the other games

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
Because this is

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
And I don't like that they even call it a remake

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
Because it's not

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
What we have instilled in our head as a remake

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
This is not a remake

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
This is a complete retelling of a game

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
So to speak

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
Ooh I like that

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
I'm going to steal that one too

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
Retelling, reinvention, reimagining

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
For gamers to expect

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
You know

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
A developer to make

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
Such a game

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000
That was originally 3 disc

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
100 hours and still release that

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
For you know 60 dollars

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
I still think it's a little bit

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
Unrealistic in today's world

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
And the reason I say

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
That is because

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
A developer can make a game

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
That is like

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
A single player game not talking about like the destinies

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
And the whatevers that are like

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
Constant ongoing games

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
Like a single player experience game

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
You have to think about

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
The amount of hours that would go into developing a game

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
To make a game that's say

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
100 hours worth of content

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
Not everybody is going to play that

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
Let's be real, how many of us

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
Have single player games that we've bought

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
And are sitting on our shelves incomplete

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
So we want developers

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
To put all this effort into

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
Making these games

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
So long that nobody finishes them

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
And they don't make

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
The money from

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
I just want to know it's there

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
I just want to know that the next time

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
There's a pandemic

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
I'll have entertainment

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
I just want that peace of mind

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
But no, I just think it doesn't make sense

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
So I think this is a good approach

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
Honestly, it may seem

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
Like price gouging

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
Like square trying to take our money

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
But really it's not, they're really giving us a completely

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
Different experience, the game is amazing

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
It's gorgeous

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
So to any haters out there I say

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
Put that thought out of your head

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
Go enjoy the game

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
I do want to say this

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
It's okay to not like the game

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000
I want to make that clear

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000
I don't want to say, oh my god something's wrong with you

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
Well I don't want to say

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
Oh there's something wrong with you

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
If you dislike the Final Fantasy 7 remake

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
Maybe it's just not your type of game

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
Maybe the battle system

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
There might be

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
But my point is

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
Know what it is you don't like

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
About the game

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
Don't assume you know

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
What you don't like about the game

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
Therein is the difference

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
Yes, I totally agree

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
So I just want to make that clear

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
Because I don't want somebody to feel like

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
Oh my god, is Rob going to drag me

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
If I don't like Final Fantasy 7 remake

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
No, as long as you know what it is

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
You don't like

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
Alright

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
Every time I see this whole like

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
Well I don't like it because it's only 10% of the original game

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
I'm just like, then you clearly haven't played it

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
No

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
And you're just making a

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
Flip in statement

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
You didn't even bother to look at the demo

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
You're making a snap judgment based off what everybody else on Twitter said

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
Your opinion is wrong

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
Sorry

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
This has actually inspired me now

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
I just actually downloaded Final Fantasy 7

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
On my Switch, the original

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
I'm dying to see

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
What's changed

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
I want to see how the first few hours of the game

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000
Played out versus this

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
Just to see how different it is

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
Ok, so like when I was

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
Doing chapter 3

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
And again I got to keep things very vague

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
Because I don't want to spoil for those that haven't even touched the game yet

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
But when I was doing chapter 3

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
I was like, I swear

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
This sequence was like

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
5 minutes in the original game

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
Like you go to this area, you talk to somebody

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
And then you're on to the next area

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
You're not spending the type of time

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
So I had to go back

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
I actually looked at a playthrough

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
Somebody had one of those

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
5 hour plays

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
Maybe that's how I got on the part 23 and all that stuff

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
But somebody had a Final Fantasy 7

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
Playthrough and the whole

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
Midgar section was 5 hours

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
And I was watching it and I caught myself watching it

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
And I was like, this, ok

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.000
Some of these things

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
Were definitely not the same

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000
I probably should have

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
Considered just watching on YouTube

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
Instead of downloading a game

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
But whatever

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
It's not like, like the question that came up earlier

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
You know, is Final Fantasy

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
Remake then better than the original?

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
I don't, like better is a very

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
Relative term, like the original

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
Is good for its own reasons

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
It's not the same game anymore

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
That's the reality

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
Yeah, that's like saying, is Final Fantasy 7

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
Better than Super Mario Brothers?

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
I

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
That depends on a lot of factors

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000
Absolutely

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
Alright Delvin, I so appreciate your opinion

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
Are you producing any content these days?

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
Are you still streaming or what?

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
You got something to plug here?

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
I only stream like very

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
Very rarely

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
Every now and then on my Twitch channel

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
Twitch.tv slash VG Realness

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
Go ahead, throw a follow

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
And turn your notifications on so you know when I'm

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
Streaming, but it's

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
Here and there, but I'm probably gonna be

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000
Doing it a little bit more now as we are in quarantine

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
But I need to finish FF7

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000
First, because as we just talked about

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000
It's not that interesting to watch

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000
Well not that it's not interesting, it's just

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
Not good content

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
But I will say this, I

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
Downloaded and played Dotless because of you

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
Because you were streaming it one night and I was like

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
Oh I need to check out this game and then I tried playing it and I was terrible at it

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
Hey, it's free

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000
It is free, so hey, I didn't lose any money

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000
So

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
Alright, Delvin, thank you so much

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000
It was so great to have you on the show

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
Thanks for having me

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000
Take care my friend, bye bye

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000
There was another person in the green room

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000
But they disappeared, so I guess they changed their mind

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:45.000
But I'll give it another minute to see if anybody comes back

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
In the meantime, do we have any last minute

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000
Stories, Loki?

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000
Yes we do, so apparently

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
You may remember the whole

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
Atari VCS console

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000
Well, we talked a little bit

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000
Back in October about how

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000
This company, Tin Giant

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
Had resigned

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
From project development

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
Because they were saying that they were

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
Citing six months worth of

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000
Unpaid invoice as well now

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
Tin Giant, the head of

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000
That company, Rob White, has

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000
Formally filed a suit

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
In Colorado Federal Court

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000
Claimed to breach a contract to the tune

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
Of $261,000

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
Because of unpaid

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
Contracts

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
So

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000
It'll be interesting to see what happens here

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000
I don't know

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.000
I didn't ever hear anything positive coming out

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000
Of this Atari console, and I don't even know

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000
When it's supposed to be coming out

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.000
The most recent release date apparently

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.000
Of the console was March 2020

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:45.000
And we haven't heard anything new yet

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.000
Well, I'll cut them a little slack

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.000
Because I'm sure the pandemic situation screwed everything up

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.000
Let's be real

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
The buzz for that Atari system

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
Wasn't there

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.000
Let's not mince words

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:59.000
The buzz for that Atari system just ain't fucking there

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.000
It's a very different story

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000
Than say Intellivision last week

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
Obviously Bobby had Tommy

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
On his show and it was a great interview

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
I hope you guys all got to check that out

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
And he's working hard

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000
To build buzz

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000
He even stopped by our little tiny

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000
Tent in the slums

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
Here of podcasting

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
To talk about Intellivision

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
Bobby's talking about that Atari system

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
Yeah, in fact

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
According to the lawsuit

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000
Tim Giant actually

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000
They basically said that

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000
In fact it was Atari's own mismanagement

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000
Of the console project that was the cause

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000
Of the reason

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000
Or reason for delayed launch

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
So

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
I want to mention this

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
In chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000
Because Pod Culture was the person that was trying to get through

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000
On Discord and had some

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000
So Pod Culture says

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
Just a quick anecdote about sending Christina

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000
My OG Switch

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000
So she could play Animal Crossing

02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000
New Horizons

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.000
While locked down

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000
You know you're actually not the first person I've heard doing that

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000
Because I guess the Switches are so hard to come by

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000
I've heard of like people mailing their relatives

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000
Because some people have a second Switch

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000
Lying around because they might have bought the Switch Lite

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000
Or they might have bought that Animal Crossing Switch

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000
Or what have you

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000
So for whatever reason they upgraded

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000
You're actually not the first I've heard of somebody doing that

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
I only have one Switch

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000
So I don't have one to mail out

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000
But I have definitely heard of that

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000
So that is a very interesting side effect

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000
Of not many Switches being available

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000
Either

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000
So anyway

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000
Just wanted to get that comment out there

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000
Since he couldn't make the call work

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000
Any other last minute stories Logie?

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
It says apparently

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000
That Xbox has committed to

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
A digital only press conference

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000
For E3 2021

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000
That seems like a

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000
Long way out to me

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000
I do remember seeing that

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000
I was going to bundle that with the inside Xbox thing

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000
Yeah they basically said

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
They've made the decision to transition

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000
All external and internal events

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000
To digital first experience through

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000
July 2021

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000
That seems like a long way out

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000
To say you're going to do digital

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000
But okay if it's digital first

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000
Then I can sort of

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000
Just going more the Nintendo route

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000
And keeping things with the direct and so forth

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000
It'll be interesting

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.000
Yeah so we'll see

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000
Alright

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000
Alright well if that's it for last minute stories

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000
I think we'll go ahead and wrap up tonight's show

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000
We've been going for a little while tonight

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000
It's a little longer than our last few shows

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.000
So we have a lot to talk about tonight

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:35.000
But I hope everyone enjoyed the show

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000
And I want to say thank you so much for tuning in tonight

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000
Whether it was live here at Twitch TV

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000
Thank you so much for being here

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000
Whether it was on iTunes or Google Podcast

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000
Or Spotify don't forget we're there now

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000
Or wherever it is you listen to podcasts

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000
Help us spread the word, tell a friend or two about the show

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.000
Because we only get folks here

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000
Listening if they know about the show

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
So we are the show where every gamer has a voice

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
But you've got to help us recruit those voices to get here

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
Auto host on Twitch

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000
Those go a long long way

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
More than I could ever really tell you

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000
So please those are all fantastic as well

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
Really appreciate those hosts

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
So I think that's all I have

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000
On that side of things

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000
So let's wrap up with our final thoughts

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000
Loki, have a great week

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
We'll see you again next week

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000
Stay safe and let's hope we get some good news

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000
On the curve and maybe things start to go downhill

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000
As far as, you know what I mean

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000
Like down the hill

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
Not like things going downhill

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000
But things going down the hill on the COVID situation this week

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.000
And maybe some good news to report next week

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
But any last thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000
No that's it

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000
Hopefully we'll play some more games this week

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
I would like to start working on my game

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000
I just haven't been able to work that out

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000
I've been switching up my grocery shopping days

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000
And so it's

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000
It takes a long time to grocery shop

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000
You just have to go to three different stores

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000
To get everything

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
But we were like super stocked up

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000
So hopefully next week it'll be a little lighter

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000
Yeah that's good

02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000
And my final thought is

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000
We do a lot of grocery shopping too

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000
But I really like food delivery

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000
And supporting local restaurants

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000
But it's so expensive

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000
Like if we could find any way to cut the cost down

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.000
That'd be great but you know

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000
We gotta pay the drivers

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000
We gotta pay the restaurants and so forth

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000
So I guess maybe I need to do a little more takeout

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000
But it's hard because you want to help everybody

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000
But at the end of the day

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000
I had an amazing Thai meal from downtown

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000
On Friday it was so good

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000
So

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.000
I definitely know as soon as this whole thing is over

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.000
I'm going back to eating out

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.000
Because it's so good

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000
Alright anyway

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.000
That's it

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.000
We're going to wrap up for this week

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000
We'll be back in seven days to do it again

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:43.000
Happy gaming whether it's Animal Crossing

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:45.000
Final Fantasy 7 Remake

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000
Persona

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:49.000
Whatever it is you're into this week

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:51.000
We hope you're having a great time doing it

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:53.000
Have fun, stay safe, stay indoors

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:55.000
Keep your distance

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:57.000
And we'll be back in seven days to talk all over again

02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:59.000
Thank you so much everybody

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:01.000
Have a wonderful night

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:05.000
See you next week

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000
Thanks for watching!
