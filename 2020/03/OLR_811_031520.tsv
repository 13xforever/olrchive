7000	14000	We're your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	18000	What is there for me to say that you haven't already heard a million times already this week?
18000	22000	Well, the PC Dune 64 remaster is going to have new content, and that's pretty badass.
22000	28000	Stay tuned for the weekend news, some you've heard, hopefully some you haven't, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
28000	38000	Orange Lounge Radio
38000	44000	Hello everybody out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
44000	50000	Starting off the show a little different tonight. For those that are watching on Twitch, it doesn't look the way it usually does.
50000	53000	For those that are listening on the podcast feed, it doesn't sound the way it usually does.
53000	57000	That's because this part of the show I'm actually taping a little bit earlier in the day.
57000	61000	So this is a prior tape segment. I don't want you guys to think I'm duping you.
61000	64000	We will be live in a little bit. I'll be live in studio with Loki in just a minute.
64000	67000	But this portion was taped earlier in the day.
67000	73000	So as you guys know, the reason why we've been gone for three weeks is that I've been on a cruise.
73000	76000	And everything was fine. Everything was normal.
76000	80000	I know people are talking a lot about cruises in the news right now, but honestly, I would have never known.
81000	85000	People were suddenly paying attention. It was a totally normal cruise.
85000	93000	I'll talk a little more about that later in the show because I think in many ways, when we did our last show, the world was in one place.
93000	97000	And now today, the world is in another.
97000	105000	And it's somewhat oddly appropriate in a way that the game playing behind me right now, if you're watching on Twitch, is Death Stranding.
105000	111000	I'm not playing the game myself. I want to credit over on YouTube. This is from a channel, Long Play Archive.
111000	116000	And of course, the fine folks at Kojima Productions who made Death Stranding.
116000	119000	We'll come back to this game in a little bit.
119000	122000	But I want to get to the main topic here for the top of the show tonight.
122000	126000	So I will be joined in studio with Loki live in just a minute.
126000	133000	But here on Discord with me at about noon today on Sunday is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Hello.
133000	135000	Hello.
135000	138000	I would ask, how are you doing?
138000	149000	Well, I am unwell. I'm not like terrible, but I'll just go ahead and go into it.
149000	161000	Not this past Friday, but the Friday before I started being short of breath, which the funny thing is that I haven't had asthma symptoms except when we had the fire.
161000	165000	Since I lost, you know, one hundred and ten pounds.
165000	170000	And so I was like, oh, it's just allergies, you know, what about my business?
170000	175000	And then it started getting a little bit worse. So but I had, you know, drainage.
175000	182000	So I messaged my doctor. She's like, yeah, it sounds like your allergies have aggravated asthma.
182000	194000	We have a high pollen count, a lot of wind. So she put me back on one of my old asthma medications and it did OK, but it was still getting worse.
194000	207000	And Saturday, walking upstairs at my work because I work in the upstairs part of my office, I got winded, which I never got winded walking upstairs.
207000	213000	I mean, you've seen me climb flights at a run, so this was really weird for me.
213000	225000	So I ended up calling the advice nurse at Kaiser and I was getting winded talking and they're like, no, we want you to go home.
225000	232000	We're going to have a doctor call you. And so I talked to the doctor and the doctor is like, well, it could be asthma.
232000	240000	It could be the other thing, as I'm calling it, the C virus. Itchy, tasty.
240000	245000	So they had me in the doctor that day.
245000	253000	And so funny, like the doctor actually calls me while I'm in the office to double check my symptoms.
253000	258000	She's like, OK, well, I got a suit up and I'm like, oh, God, they're coming in in a hazmat suit.
258000	263000	But she was just wearing like a different kind of lab coat and a mask.
263000	271000	And she's like, the symptoms are light, but it's enough that we want you under quarantine.
271000	279000	And because tests are really limited, they're saving them for the more advanced cases.
279000	284000	So they didn't test me. She just put me right under quarantine.
284000	292000	So it's not confirmed or not, but they're treating it like I have covid-19 and my symptoms are in line with it.
292000	298000	So I am I'm under quarantine for for the week.
298000	309000	And if my symptoms don't go away by Thursday or Friday, then I have to call in and get an extension of my quarantine.
309000	316000	Because you have to be free of symptoms for 48 hours before they'll let you rejoin society.
316000	323000	So and I'm sorry if you guys are hearing typing noises again, this is an unusual setup at the beginning of the show.
323000	330000	Salacious or Alan online on Twitter, Salacious Pop is on the other side of this green screen playing Mass Effect right now.
330000	334000	So if you're keyboard clacking, it's what he's doing. So a little unusual here at the start of the show.
334000	340000	But yeah, I think one important point and this is, you know, with everything that's going on in the world.
340000	347000	And look, I know like some people want to hear tonight's show as like an escape maybe of everything that's going on in the real world.
347000	352000	But I think the reality is like you can't escape this talk right now. It is everywhere.
352000	358000	And obviously it's affecting us. Like, you know, I wasn't expecting this. You weren't expecting this.
358000	363000	And here we are. You have no idea where you might have caught this or you weren't around anybody.
363000	367000	I mean, assuming we're assuming you if you had it.
367000	377000	I have an idea. One of my coworkers about a week ago is like he had been out on leave for a busted knee.
377000	380000	And he's like, I did some traveling. You know what? I think I had the thing.
380000	386000	I had all these symptoms and I didn't get tested. I just got over it. And I'm like, oh, God.
386000	399000	And I think that is like so important in light of everything that's going on is that, you know, it may seem like it's not that big a deal because it doesn't seem like they're reporting that many people that have it.
399000	405000	But I think one thing and, you know, I'm going to try very hard to not make this into a political angle or everything like that.
405000	413000	But I mean, this is the reality. Like, our government is failing us when it comes to being able to provide the needed tests.
413000	421000	And the reason why I say that is because, you know, Dark Sakura has not been tested for it, but they're just assuming she may have it.
421000	429000	I know somebody else in the exact same position having to quarantine right now and then somebody else on Facebook.
429000	436000	And so my point is, is that the numbers that are being reported are not accurate because they're not testing people.
436000	440000	You know, you can't report the number if you can't test them. Right.
440000	446000	So they don't have enough. It's part of the problem. Way more people have this than is being reported.
446000	452000	And the pandemic response team was canned in 2018. We would have been ready for this.
452000	458000	Now, I'm not saying this to make people panic or to make people freak out. That is not the point of this.
458000	463000	But I think it's important to say you have to take it seriously, you know.
463000	471000	And so, you know, and it's such a fine line you have to walk because I completely understand the angle of we don't want to shut down small businesses.
471000	477000	We don't want to stop, you know, supporting these things. People are going to be out of a job in the artistic industry and stuff.
477000	483000	And it is a very delicate line to walk. So I'm not saying like, oh my God, freak out about all that stuff.
483000	491000	But I am saying everybody's got to take precautions. That's what it is. You got to wash your damn hands, for starters.
491000	499000	I would say this for a lot of the conventions that have been canceled. They're having virtual artist alleys.
499000	510000	So please check those out. If you have coin to spare, please look to your independent artists and send them, you know, by a commission.
510000	518000	Do something to keep them up and going. I wouldn't necessarily do it through Etsy because Etsy is taking a cut.
518000	525000	But just reach out to them independently. Do commissions. Support them any way that you can.
525000	531000	And also stop being a racist fuck hole and get some damn Chinese food because it's delicious.
531000	534000	I would hope none of our listeners fall in that category, but just in case.
534000	539000	Well, I'm ordering myself some damn wonton soup and telling them to leave it on my doorstep.
539000	544000	And lots of local restaurants can do delivery. So it's, you know, a thing that, you know.
544000	553000	Although I had to order my groceries. And Dan, his job takes him to Reno a couple of times a month.
553000	570000	And with the we had like this weird like sudden rain and it affected the roads leading into like Shasta and Truckee and Tahoe.
570000	575000	And says Dan's on the other side of that and his work won't let him put chains on his car.
575000	584000	He's now on his third day stuck in Reno, which indirectly that works out for him because we were going to have to work on sleeping arrangements.
584000	591000	And, you know, so hopefully by the time he gets back, I'll be past the point of contagion.
591000	601000	I don't know what to say. Like, I just obviously I'm sure a lot of the listeners in chat right now are saying very kind things and, you know, get well soon and all of that stuff.
601000	611000	And you certainly, I mean, you sound okay. I mean, and for the most part, younger folks that get this are going to be okay.
611000	620000	But at the same time, again, I'm not trying to freak people out, but that doesn't mean every young person that gets this is going to be okay because people have immunocompromised situations and things like that.
620000	626000	So, again, it's about taking precautions. You know, you have to at least take precautions.
626000	630000	So, I'm going to run through real quick what my symptoms were.
630000	631000	Yeah.
631000	637000	And so this is what to watch out for. The shortness of breath is the big one.
637000	648000	If you find that you're winded talking, doing regular activity, stop what you're doing, go home, call, whatever, advice nurse.
648000	653000	If you go to urgent care, wear a mask.
653000	655000	If you're sick, not if you're well.
655000	665000	That's very important because the mask doesn't protect you from other people like I was wearing a mask for for my allergies because the pollen.
665000	683000	But that mask prevents your germs from spreading so quickly. It won't catch everything unless it's an N95. And those are sold out everywhere. I ordered a cloth allergy mask that has a removable filter so I can wash my mask.
683000	690000	And that is enough to keep your germs from spreading enough to go to your doctor.
690000	698000	But do not leave the house without it. If you at all feel that you have symptoms.
698000	706000	The hard thing. I love to talk. And so I'm, I'm sounding really stilted because I have to take breaths.
706000	723000	The other thing, a little bit of a sore throat, definitely a fever. Now, me personally, I since I lost weight, my body temperature naturally went down one degree, I hang around a 97.6 to point eight.
723000	728000	Excuse me. So I was running 99, which for me is a fever.
728000	734000	So make sure you know your own basal temperature.
734000	747000	Sore throats are are sometimes with it, headaches, body aches, but the biggest one is going to be being short of breath, feeling like it's asthma.
747000	763000	My oxygen levels are great, but my carbon dioxide levels were really low. And because of that, I'm having dizzy spells along with it. So, so just, you know, bear those things in mind.
763000	774000	If you're feeling sick, if you suspect, like not to freak people out because there's normal colds, normal flus. Like even when I got back from the cruise, I had a little bit of like con crud, but it was very, very light.
774000	786000	But if you're feeling those types of like symptoms, like just for the sake of, you know, not spreading it, just, you know, stay home. You know, there's ways you can still patronize and support businesses and things like that from home.
786000	796000	Well, and the other thing too, is that when someone has COVID-19, they're susceptible to other respiratory issues for months afterwards.
796000	810000	Me being that I have chronic fatigue syndrome and have had pneumonia a couple of times in my past, I'm extra susceptible to reinfection. So those are things to keep in mind.
810000	826000	And the other thing is that if you remotely suspect you have it, stay away from the elderly people in your life. Dan's grandmother is 90 years old. You better believe I'm not going anywhere near her.
826000	847000	So we've been talking for almost 15 minutes and I do want to get... No, no, no. I mean, this is important stuff. This is the world we live in right now. And on, okay, on that note, so I purposely have this game running behind me right now, Death Stranding, because you made a very interesting post on Facebook about this game, right?
848000	849000	This is how I felt.
849000	861000	This is before you had your conversation with your doctor, if I remember right. Tell us a little more, tell us a little bit about it to kind of bring it back to video games and everything that's going on in the world. Tell me, tell us a little bit about your post and maybe some of the insight with this particular game, Death Stranding.
862000	878000	Well, I had an observation that with all of the quarantine and social distancing that's going on, that I felt a little bit like we might be living kind of in a Death Stranding like situation.
878000	895000	So in the game, there's all these temporal anomalies that keep people from being able to go outside. If they're caught in it, then their body becomes explosive and creates a crater and people are staying inside their bunkers to stay safe.
896000	909000	But they're also cut off from each other. There's, you know, maybe a couple of people in a bunker or small groups or even just one or two people and they're separated from the rest of the world.
909000	918000	And so when you're playing as, oh God, what's his name again? Sam Porter. Sam Bridges Porter. Yeah.
918000	931000	When you're playing as Sam, your goal is to go and convince people to join this chiral network, which is basically fancy time manipulative Internet with holograms.
931000	944000	And so it makes me think that we have our own sort of chiral network because we have the Internet today. You know, my mom, my mom and I were talking.
944000	959000	She had the Hong Kong flu, what they were calling H3N2 in the 60s. And she, my grandmother, my grandfather, my uncle had it really bad, but they didn't have the Internet.
959000	970000	They were in quarantine and they were very isolated, very sick and very isolated. And doctors were doing home calls for that.
970000	976000	And, you know, they got over it and clearly rejoined society, hence my existence.
976000	986000	But the reality is that they not only with being sick, but you have that emotional sickness as well.
986000	992000	And a lot of us are introverts. You know, we joke about, oh, we've been preparing all our lives for this.
992000	997000	And as Gen X, you know, latch latchkey kids are like, yeah, we've been ready for this.
997000	1013000	We know what to do. But there are still no matter how much you might prefer isolation, you know, being by yourself, you still have, I think, a need to reach out to other people.
1013000	1022000	You know, we go on the Internet, we communicate and it cuts into that isolated, lonely feeling, you know.
1022000	1029000	And because we have, you know, ordering my groceries on the Internet, you know, that's what I did.
1029000	1035000	I went on to Safeway and I ordered my groceries and I got a twenty dollar coupon and it was great.
1035000	1050000	But, you know, being able to order food online, play my games online, chat what we're doing right now, me talking with you live over the Internet.
1050000	1053000	Well, semi-live, but yes.
1053000	1064000	But I mean, you know, I remember just, you know, 20 years ago, I mean, I joke about it all the time that I was Dan's mail order bride on AOL back in the day.
1064000	1072000	But it's true. Even when we had dial up, we didn't have this level of connectedness, of communication.
1072000	1077000	And so it's really a remarkable thing.
1077000	1090000	You know, you know, I believe it was attributed to Arthur C. Clark that any technology suitably advanced enough can be indistinguishable from magic.
1090000	1093000	And isn't it kind of magical that we can do this?
1093000	1096000	You know, absolutely.
1096000	1100000	You know, and I think even a game like this is as dark and dystopian as it is, it does.
1100000	1104000	You know, at the end of the day, there is hope, right?
1104000	1107000	There's hope amongst these people trying to build the network and so forth.
1107000	1112000	And, you know, society will get through this whole ordeal, but it's going to be weird.
1112000	1117000	Like, I have to be honest, like from my perspective, this whole thing just like it feels like a movie.
1117000	1130000	Like, and it's, again, from my perspective, like I got on that ship, you know, without knowing all the, you know, craziness of what cruise ships are supposed to be doing in this whole thing.
1130000	1135000	And then I feel like I stepped onto it. I had a great week. I had a wonderful time.
1135000	1138000	And then I stepped off of it and I came back to a completely different world than when I left.
1138000	1144000	And that's like, that's the weird mind game that I'm going through right now.
1145000	1160000	And the other, you know, one of the other things is that I have noticed a massive uptick in gamers helping each other out, of having more co-op type of play,
1160000	1175000	more streaming, but not just necessarily gaming streaming, but people putting out content to communicate with others, to provide that level of communication, you know, things like that.
1175000	1179000	And I think that there could be a lot of beauty that comes out of this.
1179000	1189000	There are, you know, again, with any type of increased connectiveness via the Internet, you're going to see more of the dark side of things, you know, a lot more.
1189000	1202000	Well, and not to go into Drag Race talk, but this crap going on with Sherry Pie, because we have the Internet, the stories of what she did to her victims were easily exposed.
1202000	1207000	They were able to come out and we're seeing a lot more of that.
1207000	1217000	We're seeing we're able to watch the deterioration of 45 live on TV, you know, because I'm pretty sure that asshole has it.
1217000	1226000	With all the people he touched, you know, but we're able to watch.
1226000	1230000	It could be the apocalypse, or it could be a massive revival.
1230000	1238000	We could because the other thing is that we're watching the underbelly of society, the nastiness that people have been complaining about.
1238000	1242000	We're seeing the worst case scenario. We're seeing it happen live on TV.
1242000	1247000	We are watching the fall of Rome live.
1247000	1252000	Or again, we could be watching the reform live.
1252000	1258000	We could be watching our society go through a metamorphosis, just like in the game.
1258000	1269000	You know, when they connected all of those people, they were able to change their world, you know, from this lonely separated thing into a new connected world.
1269000	1273000	Spoiler alert, but at the same time, not really, I think.
1273000	1275000	I didn't say how it happens.
1275000	1287000	Yeah, I know. I know. I know. There's a lot. This is a very general, very broad and it's, you know, if you assume that a game like this has a Hollywood ending, you could probably already figure, you know, that sort of thing.
1287000	1292000	I really glossed it. I mean, that's what everyone should assume happened anyway.
1292000	1299000	All right. So I was just to say, we got to remain hopeful in this whole thing.
1299000	1304000	You know, I'm choosing to be hopeful and everything hopefully in a couple of weeks.
1304000	1312000	I believe in science and I think we will find a way to, you know, cure or prevent or cut way back on this from a scientific perspective.
1313000	1318000	But in the meantime, you got to wash your damn hands and just be very careful.
1318000	1320000	Our job is to flatten the curve.
1320000	1321000	Yeah.
1321000	1324000	So I do have a couple of warnings to throw out there.
1324000	1333000	For everyone looking at DIY hand sanitizer, I'm going to teach you a little bit about chemistry right the fuck now.
1333000	1341000	When you get vodka or any other kind of alcohol solution, it is a solution.
1341000	1347000	When adding it, you you might think that you're doing, you know, 60 to 40, like with aloe vera or something.
1347000	1353000	But if you're doing a diluted alcohol already, you are further diluting it.
1353000	1356000	You will not be at 60 percent strength.
1356000	1363000	So either use denatured alcohol or do some fucking math.
1364000	1366000	It needs to be at least 60 percent alcohol.
1366000	1376000	But soap will do best because it has a combination of both a fat attraction and a fat repulsion.
1376000	1384000	So what it will do is it will attract the fat that's in the viral strains.
1384000	1391000	And that's why it takes 20 seconds to attract the fat and then bind it and then rinse it off.
1392000	1394000	So you need to make sure you're singing.
1394000	1396000	I will survive.
1396000	1397000	All right. And we will.
1397000	1402000	As the queen herself demonstrated, Gloria Gaynor has a video of her doing it.
1402000	1404000	We will. We will survive.
1404000	1410000	So Jamie, we're going to bring you back a little later in the show to do the classic segment here.
1410000	1418000	But for now, I think we're wrap up and we're going to any last things you want to say here before we take it to the actual live with myself and Loki.
1418000	1422000	I'm taking deliveries of pies to leave them on my doorstep, please.
1422000	1424000	All right. Well, that means you have to give out your address.
1424000	1426000	I don't know if you want to do that.
1426000	1428000	I'll give it to people local.
1428000	1434000	I'm taking appeasements in the form of delicious goodies.
1434000	1435000	All right.
1435000	1441000	You should look into one of those things where like because I know they have a thing where like streamers can get like Grubhub and stuff like that.
1441000	1444000	You should look into that because that way you there's like a middle person.
1444000	1446000	That way you're not directly giving out your address.
1446000	1448000	It's something I've seen other people do. But anyway.
1448000	1451000	I'm just mad that Postmates doesn't deliver from Sherry's.
1451000	1453000	All right.
1453000	1454000	So that's it.
1454000	1460000	Again, I want to thank Long Play Archive for this YouTube I'm borrowing of Death Stranding.
1460000	1461000	And I think that's it.
1461000	1467000	We're going to go back live to the studio with myself and Loki live.
1467000	1469000	OK. Hi.
1469000	1472000	It's been a few weeks, hasn't it?
1472000	1476000	Dark Sakura is in our chat right now and talking to folks there.
1476000	1479000	And, you know, thank you guys for showing a little love there.
1479000	1489000	And again, you know, we don't it's this interesting kind of thing in the world where we don't know the Dark Sakura has the COVID, but we don't not know.
1489000	1492000	And so it's just because we can't test all the people.
1492000	1495000	So, you know, folks are taking the appropriate precautions.
1495000	1501000	So, you know, again, if you are sick or you're feeling symptomatic or what have you, please stay home.
1502000	1506000	And it's interesting because we're seeing these parallels.
1506000	1511000	You've probably seen these news articles about the World of Warcraft Corrupted Blood incident.
1511000	1515000	You remember that whole thing, right, from original Attack Master Loki, of course, here in studio with me?
1515000	1517000	No, because I don't play World of Warcraft.
1517000	1518000	But this was everywhere in the news, right?
1518000	1525000	So basically what happened is that there was a there was a raid boss in the game that put this negative buff.
1525000	1527000	It was like a poison type buff on people.
1527000	1536000	And there was a bug that basically like if you I don't know if you like you poured it out of there just the right time or something, you could take it into the real world and actually like purposefully infect other people.
1536000	1538000	So it caused this whole plague to spread around.
1538000	1545000	But there's that whole point I put that there are unfortunately people that would go so far as to purposely give it to other people.
1545000	1548000	And some of you guys in our chat right now, because, again, we're back alive.
1548000	1555000	We do tape live, of course, over at Twitch TV slash a vog network every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
1555000	1557000	And some folks are talking about that.
1557000	1559000	Yeah. Is that in chat saying that was so annoying.
1559000	1561000	People deliberately infecting each other.
1561000	1564000	Yeah. I mean, that's it's it's horrific.
1564000	1566000	But unfortunately, there are some people like that.
1566000	1574000	So we have to do not just our due diligence and us staying home when we're sick, but keeping a moderate distance from other people, especially people we may not know.
1574000	1576000	Now, you know, here we are in studio.
1576000	1578000	Loki and I are here.
1578000	1580000	We might not be totally the six feet apart.
1580000	1582000	We're probably a good four feet apart.
1582000	1586000	And I also trust that if Loki was sick or was showing any symptoms, he wouldn't be here right now.
1586000	1589000	So are you feeling OK?
1589000	1591000	I mean, I probably shouldn't have eaten all those breadsticks.
1591000	1594000	But aside from that, yeah, that's a different problem.
1594000	1600000	But, you know, a lot of crazy stuff going on in the world, you know, big gatherings being shut down.
1600000	1603000	Yes. We'll talk about the big one related to video games here shortly.
1603000	1606000	But we're like a convenient sense of timing.
1606000	1608000	We'll get into that.
1608000	1610000	But it's like, yes, scapegoat.
1610000	1614000	There's all these interests and, you know, things are developing by the minute.
1614000	1620000	So for those that are listening on the podcast feed, what we're saying now might not be the case by the time you're listening on the podcast.
1620000	1625000	Just between the time that Dark Soccer and I taped that six hours ago.
1625000	1633000	And now we have now that California is going to be shutting down all the bars and all that type of stuff, the big gathering places.
1633000	1640000	And the CDC has actually come out and recommended no gatherings, 50 people or more for eight weeks.
1640000	1647000	So all your gaming tournaments, your Smash tournaments, your Magic Gathering tournaments, if that's what you're into.
1647000	1652000	Whatever it is in gaming, it's not banned, but it's not recommended.
1652000	1656000	So, you know, you probably shouldn't do it for eight weeks.
1656000	1664000	And, you know, unfortunately, that's going to lead to a lot of economic repercussions.
1664000	1668000	There's a lot of people that I know that are like servers, bartenders and so forth.
1668000	1675000	And right now the government has not really provided an answer as to where am I going to get my damn money, you know.
1675000	1678000	So I guess a lot of that is changing by the day.
1678000	1680000	I don't know. I don't know if I have the answer to that.
1680000	1689000	So what I do know is that many of us are using video games to escape a lot of that, taking this opportunity to catch up on gaming backlogs.
1689000	1698000	I know for me, I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy 14 online with friends this week, which is a great virtual hanging out, if you will.
1698000	1700000	And we just had news come in, late breaking news.
1700000	1707000	Xbox Live is going down or has been down, up and down since two o'clock because my kids came over like,
1707000	1713000	I can't play Minecraft with Josh. And I'm like, it's because Xbox Live is down.
1713000	1719000	Yeah. So, you know, because all these things, because everybody is quarantining are getting really hit.
1719000	1724000	We had another story about how Steam had more users ever than ever before.
1724000	1729000	It was like 20 million people on Steam yesterday. Can't imagine why.
1729000	1736000	So there's that going on. This is this is going to be, you know, and again, I'm not saying this to cause panic or what have you.
1736000	1742000	But this is this is going to change society for a little bit, you know, until we get some of these economic questions figured out.
1742000	1745000	And some of these is everything is figure outable. Right.
1745000	1753000	We'll get as long as we act normal. I mean, people buying all the toilet paper for no particular reason doesn't always strike me.
1753000	1755000	Hey, what else am I supposed to build a fort out of?
1755000	1760000	If at the end of the day, rationality prevails, we're all going to be just fine.
1760000	1770000	And I choose to remain optimistic in that regard because I can allow myself to get pessimistic because that just like then I'm going to spiral myself down down.
1770000	1774000	So I try to remain optimistic about all this type of thing and we'll figure it out.
1774000	1777000	But it is going to cause, you know, some disruptions.
1777000	1783000	And when we talk about gaming, I would not be surprised whatsoever.
1783000	1786000	PlayStation 5 and Xbox One X don't happen this year.
1786000	1795000	I think you all better prepare for that reality and you all better be prepared to act rationally to that reality that those systems ain't going to happen this year.
1795000	1800000	Because, you know, with all the quarantining and so forth, it's certainly the economic.
1800000	1807000	Sony and Microsoft don't want to release a new console when people don't have the money to buy them.
1807000	1813000	You know, people that are losing out on income and things like that, even if the government decides to step in and decide it.
1813000	1818000	Which, thank you, many folks in chat are bringing up the whole like EDD and unemployment and so forth.
1818000	1819000	But again, that's state by state.
1819000	1823000	So hopefully something will be addressed at a nationwide level.
1823000	1825000	You know, maybe in California you can recover some lost wages.
1825000	1827000	That's not the case in every state right now.
1827000	1830000	But hopefully we'll have something in the coming days.
1830000	1832000	This is a very fluid situation and so forth.
1832000	1837000	But yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if those consoles don't end up happening.
1837000	1841000	So what you might see in the interim this holiday is you might see a lot of quick projects.
1841000	1846000	You might see a lot of remasters and redos and, you know, games.
1846000	1853000	Hey, if ever there was a time for Mother 3, your odds are going to be the best this year.
1853000	1855000	But I don't know.
1855000	1858000	It's been a crazy couple of weeks, hasn't it?
1858000	1865000	How's the time to dust off that source code for the F-Zero project that you were working on Nintendo and make it happen, right?
1865000	1869000	Well, now's the time for you to dust off the source code on those games you've been programming, right?
1869000	1871000	I have been working on that stuff.
1871000	1872000	Good.
1872000	1874000	People need me to do things.
1874000	1875000	Exactly.
1875000	1882000	And Bobby Blackwolf does point out, luckily those Xbox Series X games are playable on Xbox One, so they could still release them this holiday.
1882000	1883000	That is very true.
1883000	1886000	So things like Halo and stuff might still release this holiday. Who knows?
1886000	1888000	Halo, was it Halo?
1888000	1889000	Infinite.
1889000	1891000	Infinite. Thank you. I can never remember the subtitles anymore.
1891000	1895000	I'm sure everybody's talking about Nintendo release Animal Crossing already.
1895000	1899000	But at least we'll have that on Friday, Doom on Friday.
1899000	1904000	There's going to be some... Fantasy Star Online 2 goes into open beta, and I think all that starts rolling very soon.
1904000	1911000	So at least there will be some things to distract us during all this craziness that's happening right now.
1911000	1918000	Yeah, DarkSakura is in our chat talking about artists and people who live on tips are really going to suffer.
1918000	1920000	They don't have unemployment for drag.
1920000	1923000	That's right. A lot of independent contractors and stuff.
1923000	1930000	So I don't know. In my opinion, there should be some type of tax refund from last year's taxes.
1930000	1936000	Some big refund. But again, I'm not a politician. Maybe people see problems with what I'm proposing.
1936000	1943000	But I don't know if there's an easy answer. Hopefully people can fucking work together already to figure it out.
1944000	1947000	This is J100 Mattis talking about what's going on in his work.
1947000	1953000	Because of the nature of his business and the types of things that are getting cancelled, there is no business right now.
1953000	1959000	And saying, I have co-workers that would rather get the virus and potentially die than not work and not get paid, which is sad.
1959000	1966000	That is incredibly sad. But those types of depression and mental health things are going to be very real.
1966000	1972000	So check in on people. Call people. Say hello. FaceTime is great right now.
1972000	1979000	And the comparable stuff. If you're not an Apple person, there's all sorts of comparable stuff. Skype and Discord, etc.
1979000	1987000	And a lot of tech companies, thankfully, are wheeling out some of the free deals and so forth to try to lessen the brunt of this.
1987000	1991000	Like Discord has upped the number of people you can broadcast to from 10 to 50.
1991000	1995000	Which might not be a big deal to a lot of people, but to some people it's going to be pretty cool.
1995000	2001000	And you've heard about probably the bandwidth caps are getting lifted, which probably goes to show they were never needed.
2001000	2005000	But I guess that's another argument for a different day. But we know that those caps are not going to be there.
2005000	2007000	So now's the time to get all your patches.
2007000	2009000	I'm going to download all of the porn!
2009000	2014000	You know what's crazy to me too? Is I was even thinking this month, because we were on the cruise last week,
2014000	2018000	I was thinking, we're only going to be using like three-fourths of the data we usually use.
2018000	2020000	So this is a good time for me to download it.
2020000	2024000	Oh, that's probably when your Xbox One decided to download the same patch 50 times while you're out.
2024000	2029000	It's not going to matter anymore anyway. That thing is hard unplugged. It's not going to download anything.
2030000	2032000	Well, now I can plug it in safely. It won't matter.
2032000	2033000	But anyway.
2036000	2041000	Dark Tutsi says, there is another big release coming this week. My wife already has our copy on pre-order.
2041000	2046000	MissyOLR in chat says, Loki, better you than me on all the porn.
2046000	2049000	Snirk, I'm sure you guys have heard about the clever things that Pornhub has been doing.
2049000	2051000	Especially for folks in Italy where...
2051000	2052000	VPN?
2052000	2054000	Yeah. Anyway.
2054000	2060000	Again, I don't mean to talk about... I know some of you are tuning into OLR tonight because you want an escape from all the stuff that's going on in the real world.
2060000	2062000	So I'm sorry to kind of like bring it up.
2062000	2065000	But at the same time, like you can't escape it.
2065000	2067000	And I think being informed is important.
2067000	2070000	And there are certain precautions you should take.
2070000	2076000	But at the same time, you know, do your best to still try to support and stimulate the economy best you can.
2076000	2079000	And that is not by buying all the toilet paper.
2079000	2086000	But since the restaurants and bars are going to be closed, maybe choose to have a dinner night where you're going to order out from one of these places.
2086000	2089000	Because, you know, you got all these delivery types of services and things like that.
2089000	2098000	If the convention you went to is getting cancelled and you're no longer going to get to go, make it a point to go visit a virtual artist alley online.
2098000	2107000	Go look at 10 independent folks selling their stuff online and just like you would browse their booths at a convention and see if there's something you might want to look at.
2107000	2112000	To bring it back to gaming a little bit, you're going to have to treat the real world like an MMO for a little bit.
2112000	2115000	You're going to have to go and visit the shops virtually.
2115000	2117000	See what there is you might be interested in.
2117000	2119000	You're going to have to check in on your friends virtually.
2119000	2125000	Some folks that are artists and so forth may look to doing virtual types of performances.
2125000	2134000	So if you do have a, let's say you have an improv comedy troupe, such as I've seen one here locally, that is going to be doing improv comedy on Twitch.
2134000	2138000	Because they can't have improv comedy shows.
2138000	2141000	Check it out. Tip them if you're so inclined.
2141000	2144000	Whether that be through Twitch or PayPal or so forth.
2144000	2145000	You know, if you're able to.
2145000	2150000	Again, I know some people are very economically concerned right now and can't afford to do any of that.
2150000	2153000	And that's the reality of the situation.
2153000	2155000	So everybody, you can help spread the word though.
2155000	2159000	So everybody kind of does what they can and that's the most important thing through all of this.
2159000	2161000	Do what you can.
2162000	2169000	But turning your head the other way and putting your fingers in your ears and going la la la, it doesn't exist, is not what some people are doing on Twitter.
2169000	2172000	And some people are convinced that this isn't real.
2172000	2181000	I just got a fucking message on a chat thing from somebody who's trying to tell me that this is all, oh it's like, you know, you never know what the government is doing and all this stuff.
2181000	2188000	And I'm like, you know what, if you believe that this thing is all a conspiracy, I had a friend that died from H1N1.
2188000	2193000	You want to tell me that that was a fucking conspiracy? Sit the fuck down and shut the fuck up.
2195000	2197000	And that's all I have to say about that.
2198000	2199000	Anyway.
2200000	2201000	Um, hi.
2202000	2203000	Hello.
2203000	2204000	I had to get that off my chest.
2204000	2206000	That comment really irked me.
2206000	2209000	Like that the people dying is a fucking lie.
2209000	2219000	I was trying to figure out yesterday for a little bit until I said, I don't really care anymore about why people were mad about some woman that was tweeting that she went to like a red Robin or something like that with full people.
2219000	2226000	I'm like, I don't, I didn't understand why everyone was getting mad at her other than it being stupid.
2226000	2233000	But like, I don't think it was the fact that she was going to red Robin and all that, but I think it was just kind of like the, the fucking smugness of it.
2233000	2236000	You know, it's sometimes it's not what you say, but it's how you say it.
2236000	2243000	There's nothing wrong with supporting your local red Robin, as long as you're taking, you know, applying the appropriate social distancing and all that stuff.
2243000	2250000	Uh, there's nothing wrong with it, but I think it was more of the fucking tone of it where it's like, well, since I'm young and healthy, fuck all y'all, I'm going to go have a burger.
2250000	2257000	I just didn't understand who this person was and why we should even be angry at her because like, I'm like, who cares that you went to a restaurant.
2257000	2258000	I don't give a shit.
2258000	2260000	I don't even know who the hell you are.
2261000	2262000	I never figured that out.
2262000	2263000	So I gave up.
2263000	2267000	Uh, it's, it's some things, some things aren't worth going down the rabbit hole for.
2267000	2270000	Let's talk about video games a little bit best we can.
2270000	2271000	How was your gaming week?
2271000	2273000	Let's talk a little bit about the types of video games you've been playing this week.
2273000	2280000	Well, I've been playing a lot of Minecraft because we had our, um, realm that we've been playing.
2280000	2282000	And so that's been fun with the kids.
2282000	2289000	And now I've been trying to research how to do add-ons for Minecraft to add some things.
2289000	2296000	One of the ideas I had in mind, um, I wanted to incorporate because like, I, I like adding new weapons to the game just to make it more interesting.
2296000	2301000	So I wanted to do like, um, the final fantasy six weapons, um, Edgar's weapons.
2301000	2309000	So all of the, um, you know, uh, chainsaw auto crossbow, that stuff that be awesome to add to the game.
2309000	2313000	So I kind of wanted to see how hard it would be to do something like that.
2313000	2318000	Uh, but some of the like stuff that people have already made, like they've taken the mobs.
2318000	2327000	And I don't understand why they haven't added it to the game yet, but they have like new mobs that are for Minecraft earth, but they're not in the vanilla game.
2327000	2331000	So people just said, okay, well, I'm just gonna put it in the vanilla game.
2331000	2334000	I mean, it was super easy and the models are already created, so why not?
2334000	2340000	So I added those in, um, and dog armor because that's fun.
2340000	2351000	Um, what else? So we've been playing a lot of Orna because you created a kingdom and now we're structured and we, it's just been raids and raids and raids and raids.
2351000	2356000	So you have to have a hundred, uh, reputation in order to make a kingdom.
2356000	2360000	And what's happened is that Orna still has some balancing issues, right?
2360000	2369000	Because what's happened is that a lot of the people who played Orna early on captured all the land and they're leveling up faster than the rest of us can level up.
2369000	2375000	So it's impossible for us to take the land back from them, although I'm learning you can chip away and that's what I've been doing.
2375000	2378000	So like there's a local one here, which some guy took from me.
2378000	2384000	I've been chipping away at him for like an entire day and I should only have to fight him about three more times and I'll finally take my land back.
2384000	2386000	He'll probably come over and take it, but whatever.
2386000	2395000	But my point is, is that it's really hard to like get a hundred pieces of empty land, um, and, and claim it in Orna because like everything's taken by these high level people.
2395000	2396000	Here's, here's the gag.
2396000	2398000	So I was on that cruise.
2398000	2408000	So I was on the Star Trek cruise and we had ship wifi and usually the ship was just far enough from the coast that we were still able to like, I don't know, however that GPS magic works.
2408000	2411000	It was still able to get a position most of the time.
2411000	2413000	So I was able, able to bring up Orna.
2413000	2419000	And as we're slowly moving through the ocean, capture the land, because who's, who, who has the land in the ocean?
2419000	2420000	Me.
2420000	2429000	So I captured like 170 pieces of land in the middle of the fucking Atlantic, somewhere between the Bahamas, Cuba, Puerto Rico.
2429000	2432000	Do they have like shops and stuff in the middle of the ocean as well?
2432000	2436000	They do. It's all monsters, bosses. It's all populated, just like it would be on dry land.
2436000	2437000	That's great.
2437000	2438000	It kind of cracked me up.
2438000	2445000	I think the, the cities or the zones or whatever in Orna are bigger, but you know, the boat was going what 30, 40 miles an hour.
2445000	2451000	And so every, it would be just long enough for the ship wifi scan the area, hold the cap, wait for it to process.
2451000	2454000	Okay. You capped it, go back to the main screen up new area.
2454000	2456000	So it was kind of like, I did that.
2456000	2458000	Like I was, I was really exhausted and tired.
2458000	2462000	So I just lied in the bed and I did that for 45 minutes and I captured so much land.
2462000	2464000	So I was like, okay guys, let's do a kingdom.
2464000	2466000	I can start a kingdom, which the gag is.
2466000	2473000	I should probably not be the person running the kingdom because I'm also like, I'm really weak and sad.
2473000	2476000	So I promoted my Ingress buddies who know what they're doing in that game.
2476000	2479000	So they're able to run, but it's only like six of us in the kingdom.
2479000	2480000	So whatever.
2480000	2482000	So yeah.
2482000	2483000	Yeah.
2483000	2487000	Looking at the comments in chat, Bobby Blackwell says Rob owns the Bermuda triangle in Orna.
2487000	2488000	I sure do.
2488000	2491000	Actif says this is Rob's world and we're all living in it.
2491000	2493000	Well, if you're in the middle of the ocean, yes.
2493000	2496000	Fifth dream today says Rob Roberts, Duke of the ocean.
2496000	2497000	Absolutely fifth dream.
2497000	2499000	You can join the kingdom.
2499000	2503000	You have to be part of the red team or the fire faction in order to be able to do it.
2503000	2505000	I switched from lightning.
2505000	2511000	I switched to the red team because we had a really good idea since those of us who founded it kind of all play Ingress.
2511000	2519000	We decided to make our team Ingress red faction because the red faction is a running joke in the game Ingress about people,
2519000	2525000	you know, who are, who kind of get sick of the player versus player element of it and want everybody to get along and all that.
2525000	2528000	So I made a red team and it's called Ingress red faction.
2528000	2531000	So if you actually search that, just search for Ingress on the red side and you'll find it.
2531000	2533000	And if you need a faction change, you can do it for like 99 cents.
2533000	2535000	And I figure it goes for the developers or whatever.
2535000	2540000	So, um, but we do a lot of raids and it's a lot of, uh, trying to get there.
2540000	2542000	We're all learning this whole thing.
2542000	2544000	So it's, uh, but so far so good.
2544000	2545000	Yes.
2545000	2547000	And I've surpassed you in levels like by a lot.
2547000	2551000	You have, but you built your character smarter, I guess.
2551000	2553000	Cause I go in the magic route.
2553000	2555000	I'm not able to take stuff out the way you can.
2555000	2556000	So it's fine.
2556000	2557000	I'm dealing with it.
2557000	2561000	Or mostly magic heavy based on kind of what I'm looking at here.
2561000	2562000	Yeah.
2562000	2563000	So there you go.
2563000	2565000	That's, uh, that's, uh, Orna, I guess.
2565000	2567000	Anything else for gaming week?
2567000	2570000	Um, no, that's pretty much it.
2570000	2571000	Yeah.
2571000	2572000	Okay.
2572000	2573000	Uh, my gaming week.
2573000	2575000	So, um, I was on that cruise.
2575000	2579000	I'm on the star Trek cruise, uh, again, and I mentioned this in the opening of the show.
2579000	2584000	Um, I, one of the big thing, everybody at work, nobody's asking me about where we went
2584000	2585000	or what we did.
2585000	2587000	It's just about, Oh, did they have any problems?
2587000	2589000	Oh, they let you on the ship.
2589000	2590000	Okay.
2590000	2591000	They let you off the ship.
2591000	2592000	Okay.
2592000	2594000	Um, none of that was an issue at all.
2594000	2598000	When we got on the ship, the people, so like when you get onto the cruise ship, it's kind
2598000	2602000	of like checking into a hotel, except there's like 15 stations all open and you're going
2602000	2603000	through this big snake line.
2603000	2606000	So, when we walked up, you know, she took our passports, read them, she got all the
2606000	2607000	information.
2607000	2611000	And then she picks up this little piece of paper and said, have you within the past 15
2611000	2615000	days traveled to the, the, these parts of China, this parts of Italy.
2615000	2617000	She's like reading this little script and we're like, no.
2617000	2618000	Okay.
2618000	2619000	Get on the boat.
2619000	2620000	So, that, that was it.
2620000	2622000	That was the only thing that was different.
2622000	2624000	And, um, otherwise the cruise ship was very sanitary.
2624000	2629000	Uh, we had, they have sanitizer everywhere before you go to eat.
2629000	2630000	There's the person there.
2630000	2631000	That's washy washy.
2631000	2633000	The, you know, that's a wash, wash, wash, wash it.
2633000	2634000	That's all as everybody.
2634000	2637000	I think, I think Royal Caribbean ended up making a song out of it or something.
2637000	2638000	I didn't see this.
2638000	2641000	I guess this YouTube was going out like while we were on the cruise, but they weren't playing
2641000	2645000	on the TV where I was at or anything, but you know, it just, that's part of the habit
2645000	2649000	you want, but because of everything that was going on in the world, nobody objected to
2649000	2650000	it.
2650000	2652000	Nobody was like, Oh no, don't put sanitizer in my hand or what?
2652000	2653000	Nope.
2653000	2654000	Everybody was doing it on the way in.
2654000	2656000	It was just part of, part of the thing.
2656000	2657000	And it was fine.
2657000	2662000	Um, and, um, yeah, like all the celebrities that were advertised were going to be there.
2662000	2666000	I got to have my 15 seconds with Kate Mulgrew, Jerry Ryan.
2666000	2667000	We got some good photos.
2667000	2670000	They're on my personal Facebook, but I guess I should put some of those on Twitter, huh?
2670000	2675000	Um, so I have a great picture with the cast of Star Trek Voyager, at least the ones that
2675000	2676000	were there.
2676000	2682000	So they had like Garrett Wong, Tim Russ, Ricardo, uh, the guy that plays Neelix, uh,
2683000	2686000	Kate Mulgrew, Roxanne Biggs, Dawson, Jerry Ryan's.
2686000	2688000	They had a pretty good contingent of Voyager people that were there.
2688000	2691000	Um, and I did get my picture with all of them, with Alan.
2691000	2692000	So it was nice.
2692000	2696000	Um, yeah, we had a great time on the cruise, so I don't know if you guys have any specific
2696000	2698000	questions so I can talk a little more about it at the end of the show, maybe during the
2698000	2700000	call-in segment, if you guys want to know more specific things.
2700000	2707000	Um, there was an arcade on the cruise, the most overpriced arcade I have ever seen in
2707000	2712000	my entire life where like one go on a ticket spitter game would cost like a dollar.
2712000	2713000	It was nuts.
2713000	2720000	Rob, perhaps you should go to arcades more often cause that's pretty bog standard nowadays.
2720000	2721000	Wow.
2721000	2722000	Oh my God.
2722000	2723000	Yeah.
2723000	2724000	Yeah.
2724000	2725000	I will say their ski ball machine looked really nice.
2725000	2727000	Like it was really new and fancy.
2727000	2732000	Um, but as far as like regular games, I think they would have like the Jurassic park shooter.
2732000	2735000	There's a couple of like the types of same type of stuff you'd see in a movie theater.
2735000	2736000	Yeah.
2736000	2738000	Uh, there was one music game.
2738000	2740000	It was a sad guitar hero arcade.
2740000	2744000	I say sad, not because the game's fine, but it's also a few years old and the machine
2744000	2746000	was in a little bit of sad condition.
2746000	2748000	No DDR or anything like that.
2748000	2751000	Um, I JD who many of you know is in chat.
2751000	2753000	He was also on the cruise with us.
2753000	2756000	He went to look at that first thing and like texted right away.
2756000	2757000	There's no DDR frown.
2757000	2761000	And I'm like, well, the boat goes like up a DDR and the boat might be weird.
2761000	2764000	I don't know if that's the place I'd want to play DDR, but they did have an arcade on
2764000	2765000	the boat.
2765000	2766000	So I thought that was kind of funny.
2766000	2770000	So, um, yeah, there was all sorts of stuff on the boat.
2770000	2774000	I never even got around to seeing like there was a Johnny rockets restaurant on the boat
2774000	2777000	and we just, we didn't eat there because it was an extra price to eat there.
2777000	2781000	And Johnny rockets and I can eat Johnny rockets in the mall.
2781000	2783000	That's why we never went there.
2783000	2786000	Uh, there was like a rock climbing wall and some stuff, but now the boat's getting refurbished
2786000	2787000	before next year.
2787000	2789000	Uh, Alan and I are not going to go back next year.
2789000	2793000	Uh, we decided that on the boat is that because we have been saving our money, we've been
2793000	2794000	saving our money.
2794000	2796000	We want to get a house, which hopefully means a new studio and things like that.
2796000	2799000	So we just have some financial goals we've been working on.
2799000	2803000	Unfortunately, the events of the last week have us all sitting here with a big question
2803000	2804000	mark when it comes to economics.
2804000	2807000	So I don't know what the future is going to hold there.
2807000	2808000	I'm just going to try to remain hopeful.
2808000	2811000	Um, but no, uh, no star Trek cruise five for me.
2811000	2814000	Hopefully if you know, things don't go too crazy.
2814000	2819000	Star Trek cruise six, uh, will be, um, uh, something we can do.
2819000	2820000	I'd love to do that.
2820000	2825000	Um, but as far as games been playing a lot of Final Fantasy 14, I had nothing going on
2825000	2827000	this weekend and didn't really want to leave the house.
2827000	2831000	Uh, so we, I played some Final Fantasy 14 online.
2831000	2835000	You know, we had, Alan and I had little errands to do and things like that, but, um, you know,
2835000	2838000	with everything that's going on, we've just been trying to keep to ourselves.
2838000	2840000	We met some friends out at the restaurant before you left.
2840000	2842000	Didn't you play a Final Fantasy seven remake?
2842000	2844000	Well, yes, I was going to get to that.
2844000	2848000	So no, I didn't play it before I left because that came out the Monday I was on the cruise.
2848000	2849000	Oh yeah.
2849000	2853000	So that all hit the internet and all of you have played it before I got back.
2853000	2854000	I have not played it yet.
2854000	2855000	I downloaded it by having gotten a chance.
2855000	2856000	Oh, you should.
2856000	2858000	Um, I did check it out when I got back.
2858000	2861000	Um, so I was, you know, home on Tuesday or something.
2861000	2862000	I was like, Oh yeah, that demo came out.
2862000	2863000	I need to check that out.
2863000	2868000	So I downloaded it and I played it and I got to say, I was, I was liking it.
2868000	2873000	Um, it is very different from regular Final Fantasy seven, uh, because the active time
2873000	2874000	battle is not there.
2874000	2877000	The battling system is a little more like 15.
2877000	2883000	Um, but it actually somehow feels like a little more simplified in a way than 15 did.
2883000	2884000	That's good.
2884000	2892000	Because I think they did try to, um, incorporate a little bit of when you have enough blue bar, you can do it more traditional Final Fantasy casting of fire and things like that.
2892000	2893000	So it's a little interesting.
2893000	2903000	But one thing I noticed, like this is, this is the thing that really jumped out at me about the Final Fantasy seven demo is it was very, very fluid and things really, really popped and everything had style.
2903000	2906000	Like it had a very strong artistic direction to the game.
2906000	2913000	You remember in the original Final Fantasy seven, for those that have played it, it was very, very obvious when you were looking at, this is a game scene.
2913000	2916000	This is something that's rendered in the game engine.
2916000	2918000	And this is something that was fully rendered beforehand.
2918000	2920000	That is a movie file on the CD ROM.
2920000	2924000	And like, there were like three different versions of cloud and one was really blocky.
2924000	2927000	One was very, you know, the compression is real.
2927000	2929000	That doesn't exist now.
2929000	2933000	It is one very, very fluid experience.
2933000	2935000	And I was really pleased with it.
2935000	2942000	You know, just how you would go in a battle and you're doing that and then just suddenly the characters having a conversation and it's turned around and you're back in a battle.
2942000	2946000	And I was like, dang, this is like nonstop, like artistic flair.
2946000	2951000	Like every button press you do is like some type of spiral jump and whoosh.
2951000	2953000	Like it's just very, very animated.
2953000	2956000	I don't know if everybody's going to be into that, but I was super into it.
2956000	2961000	And I think some people are going to be really turned off by the fact it's not like Final Fantasy 7's battle system.
2961000	2965000	I was going to make it a point to try to play through in the, so I played through on the normal mode.
2965000	2969000	I was going to try to make it a point to play through on the classic mode just to kind of compare the difference.
2969000	2971000	I just didn't get around to it, unfortunately.
2971000	2975000	But I'm hearing classic is not really classic.
2975000	2980000	It's just that the game will kind of take care of the hard parts for you.
2980000	2985000	So that way when your bar is full, you're still, that part of the ATB is still there.
2985000	2990000	Your bar fills up and you're choosing what move you want to do, but the game otherwise kind of plays itself a little bit.
2990000	2995000	But not in a, you're not doing anything kind of way, if that makes sense.
2995000	3000000	The big Scorpion fight was a lot harder than I was expecting.
3000000	3003000	I probably had to pop like 13 potions to get through that battle.
3003000	3010000	It was a tough fight, but I, you know, one problem I have in Final Fantasy games is that I'm constantly hoarding.
3010000	3015000	And by the time I get to the final boss, it's like, wow, I have like 99 X potions and I never used one.
3015000	3023000	So I don't know if like this game is really trying to break that mentality where it's like, no bitch, you're going to use those potions that you're finding in boxes and stuff.
3023000	3029000	Like there's a reason we're putting two potions in every box and telling you to go break boxes because you're going to use those potions.
3029000	3036000	So if I was able to break down that mental barrier of I don't need to hoard all my shit.
3036000	3042000	Like I don't need to save it for a time. I'm going to need it because now is the time I'm going to need it.
3042000	3046000	Once I was able to kind of break that mentality, I had no problem with the Scorpion boss.
3046000	3052000	So but I think it is going to cause some people some issues, but they put the multiple difficulty levels in there, I suppose, for a reason.
3052000	3062000	There is that whole thing. Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I got a little frustrated in normal mode, played classic, and it doesn't auto attack as often as it would if you're holding square.
3062000	3072000	So I'll play on easy. So there is kind of that middle ground as well where it's like, it's easier, but you don't have to worry so much, I guess, about the super death.
3072000	3075000	Easy is the same as classic without the auto attack. Oh, okay.
3075000	3081000	Cia Tabiri in chat says, I have no interest in playing Final Fantasy 7, but I'm glad people are excited for this.
3081000	3090000	Yeah, and DarkSakura is in chat saying the demo was pretty rad. Yeah, like I really enjoyed it. It's making me excited for the game.
3090000	3096000	But boy oh boy, you guys, you better be prepared for the fact that the story is not going to be what you remembered.
3096000	3104000	Because at the end of the demo, and I guess I don't want to spoil a demo, but seriously, go play it.
3104000	3113000	But all I'm going to say is that there's a plot twist at the end of the demo that I had to sit there for a minute and go, that wasn't in Final Fantasy 7.
3113000	3122000	They added that, and that changes, although, and I was talking with a friend about it, and I'm sure you guys are going to jump in and chat, those of you that know what I'm talking about.
3122000	3136000	It was alluded to, and it was a maybe it went down like this type of thing, but they never show it as explicitly as they do in this demo where it's like, oh no, this is canon, the way this goes down.
3136000	3141000	So that's what I'm going to say about it. If you haven't played the demo, I'm going to say there is a big change in the plot.
3141000	3149000	And so, you know, Loki, with some of the tinfoil hat things I've been saying on this show, I'm like, oh, so they're not afraid to change the plot.
3149000	3157000	So, Earth comes out and she's like, look at this, I got this armor that's impenetrable by any sword in the universe.
3157000	3164000	So yeah, all I'm going to say is just be prepared, there could be plot changes.
3164000	3176000	I still think the big stuff is going to have to stay canon to an extent, but maybe the how it goes down or the after effects or, you know, maybe there's a spirit you can bring back.
3176000	3183000	I don't know, I would not be tied down to, well, it's going to be this way because it was this way in the original Final Fantasy 7.
3183000	3191000	It's still going to be interesting to see how that all kind of plays out because the fact that that game is episodic and is only going to go through that Midgar part of the game.
3191000	3199000	But I can definitely see now if they're unafraid to add some flourishes and subtext and you can see it in the demo.
3199000	3203000	That's how they're going to get a full game out of just what happened in Midgar because the plot is going to be a little different.
3203000	3208000	So anyway, so that was that was my Game of the Week Final Fantasy.
3208000	3214000	I did I guess one other thing I should say, I did finally, you know, I guess desperate times call for desperate measures type of thing.
3214000	3219000	And I got bored enough where I installed Diablo 3 and I played it again.
3219000	3225000	So if for those of you that were watching me, how long am I going to keep the Blizzard launcher off my computer? Time's up.
3225000	3231000	However, this is important. I'm playing a game I've already paid for and not giving any extra money.
3231000	3238000	So there is that. But I did Diablo season 20 started and I was like, I kind of want to play.
3238000	3243000	So I did. So I have my witch doctors up to like level 35 or something like that.
3243000	3246000	So. All right. That's it for my gaming week.
3246000	3253000	So I suppose we should get back into some news. And I think Loki has a big one to talk about.
3253000	3262000	So E3 2020 has been canceled. And this is not a huge surprise considering all the events prior to it being canceled.
3262000	3266000	GDC, South by Southwest, that type of stuff.
3266000	3269000	So they put out a press release saying, you know,
3269000	3277000	after careful consultation with our members, our member companies regarding the health and safety of everyone in our industry,
3277000	3280000	our fans, our employees, our exhibitors and our longtime E3 partners,
3280000	3290000	we have made the difficult decision to cancel E3 2020 scheduled for June 9th through on the 11th in Los Angeles.
3290000	3295000	So it's official. It is official. But now and you alluded to this earlier in the show,
3295000	3302000	and I'm sure a lot of people are. I think that it's an it's a scapegoat,
3302000	3306000	because I think that they had already seen the writing on the wall that several things,
3306000	3311000	you know, several companies were dropping out of the event, big name companies.
3311000	3317000	And now it's like, well, we have an excuse to do this because everyone else is doing it as well.
3317000	3323000	It makes sense. The only reason I say that, because like I get it, that it's still months off from now.
3323000	3326000	So we don't know what the situation is going to be in June.
3326000	3331000	I mean, by June, we could be in much better shape than we are now.
3331000	3338000	Just like we you know, there's other conventions that haven't said they're closing yet and it's around the same time,
3338000	3342000	or they could have pushed it to a later time.
3342000	3347000	I just feel like that this may have happened even without the whole COVID stuff.
3347000	3349000	I'm kind of a middle of the roader here.
3349000	3355000	I think it was one of those things where when the COVID stuff happened, it was like, well, now we're now we're really screwed.
3355000	3358000	Like we were already on the bubble. And now with this, it's like, fuck it.
3358000	3360000	Like there's no way we can put on the show.
3360000	3367000	I think it was that the COVID virus and all the concerns around that it made a bad situation even worse.
3367000	3372000	Yes. And I think that's what it is with E3 is that E3 was already in a bad place.
3372000	3378000	Now, how are you going to convince people to come to your expo when they were going to have to kind of like extra do that?
3378000	3384000	Like the E3 is still cool. You know, take your week off and come out to L.A. and, you know, get all that travel.
3384000	3386000	Come out here. And now it's like, oh, fuck.
3386000	3391000	Now, how are we going to convince people to come out here for the super cool E3 amongst all this other stuff?
3391000	3397000	That's what makes me wonder, because like you have like GDC that's decided that like, OK, we're postponing our event.
3397000	3401000	We're not canceling it outright yet. They're postponing it to the summer.
3401000	3406000	Whereas I think E3 could have maybe gotten away with doing something similar, like postponing it.
3406000	3414000	But I mean, I just I feel that we kind of thought that they were going to cancel it anyways.
3414000	3423000	And so I feel that this is just like it kind of gets lost with all of the craziness going on that it's like, yeah, we're doing our part.
3423000	3429000	See, we're responsible with with people and not like leaking all of their information all over the Internet or anything like that.
3429000	3432000	See, we're responsible. So we're doing the right thing and canceling this event.
3432000	3438000	And it could have been also, too, that like other companies may have taken that precaution like they did with GDC and would have pulled out.
3438000	3441000	And then you're going to have E3 with just nobody there.
3441000	3448000	And so while I get it that they had to do it because of that,
3448000	3455000	at the same time, it makes me wonder if if these companies have a success with their own events and their own digital events and stuff like that.
3455000	3458000	They're just that's even more reason they don't need you anymore.
3458000	3463000	Well, the ESA is going to have to use this opportunity to make lemonade out of lemons, I suppose.
3463000	3470000	And so now the cancellation of E3 will just get thrown in the pile with South by Southwest and the countless,
3470000	3474000	you know, anime and other gaming that are being canceled and so forth, you know.
3474000	3481000	So E3 is just going to kind of get thrown in that pile and nobody is going to assume, oh, there was some type of internal failure at E3 that causes to happen.
3481000	3488000	So the ESA has a reprieve in this regard to go away for a year and figure out how you're going to fix the show.
3488000	3490000	And hopefully you better make good use of that year.
3490000	3497000	Well, and, you know, and as I said earlier, there is a I know I know Microsoft is planning their own thing.
3497000	3499000	And I'm sure you can talk about some of this in a minute.
3499000	3505000	But there's still that real possibility that Microsoft may not be putting out the Xbox One X this year after all.
3505000	3507000	And Sony may not put out the PlayStation five.
3507000	3512000	I don't know about that. It's it's still a good like that's half a year away.
3512000	3516000	It is. But the economic damage, Loki, it's going to it's it's going to be.
3516000	3520000	I don't know if we even know what the economic situation is going to be.
3520000	3526000	I'm not saying it's going to be canceled. I'm just saying prepare yourself for that possibility because it's a distinct possibility, you know.
3526000	3535000	And if this economic stuff gets even crazier than it already is, quite frankly, I mean, many people are going to be out of work for six to eight weeks.
3535000	3543000	We know that now like that is going to happen. So, yeah, it's yeah.
3543000	3548000	Anyway, but as far as E3 goes now, some stuff that have been pointed out in our chat.
3548000	3555000	Bobby Black Wolf over Twitch TV slash VOG Network said last week while you were out, I am eight bit pulled out as a partner,
3555000	3559000	which means there was probably friction behind the scenes on how to put it together.
3559000	3565000	And Fifth Dream Today follows that up, that Jeff Keighley guy never had to announce he wasn't going after all.
3565000	3568000	Well, he I guess he never really did have to make that big announcement.
3568000	3572000	But he did. And so we knew that there was something going on.
3572000	3584000	And yeah, the I am eight bit thing just kind of pours onto that where it's E3 must have had some real struggles behind the scene on where they were going or an unpopular decision was made or something was up that all come out of the woodwork.
3584000	3588000	Eventually, I think we'll find out about it.
3588000	3590000	Yeah, but.
3590000	3598000	SSG100Matt in chat says, I'm sure as hell not going to get a new console this year. Ask me a week ago, then. Yeah, I would have.
3598000	3612000	Even I mean, there was a time and date where I said, oh, yeah, I'm going to buy them all just because I'm because I don't know if I mean, I am very fortunate again where my job so far doesn't seem to be as impacted as other stuff.
3612000	3617000	But I don't know the long term effects of this stuff. So I'm getting a new console.
3617000	3620000	If they come out this year.
3620000	3626000	I'll get a new console. I didn't hear about any sort of delays within television. So there you go.
3626000	3634000	Television, if nothing else, right? Television wants you to stay home and play with your family. Don't go out that dirty outside, you know, and tell me, release the amico early.
3634000	3641000	We need to keep people indoors. All right. Anyway, so E3 not going to happen this year.
3641000	3644000	Maybe it's going to be a blessing in disguise as far as the show is concerned.
3644000	3650000	Yes. And so, like, as you were alluding to, it is a little farther out than most things are being canceled.
3650000	3654000	Yeah. That was one other thing that made people raise an eyebrow. Not a lot of June stuff.
3654000	3661000	The only other thing in June that I've heard is on the bubble right now is ironically also in L.A., L.A. pride.
3661000	3665000	They are I think they have canceled that. That was supposed to be the. So E3 is during the week, right?
3665000	3673000	L.A. was both pride was supposed to be that weekend. And they are talking about that that is probably not going to happen now or it's going to happen in a scaled down type of way.
3673000	3677000	Well, you know, shit's hitting the fan when Disneyland closes for a few weeks.
3677000	3681000	Have you turned on the TV? Were they back? No. Oh, yeah.
3681000	3685000	No, Disneyland is closing for. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, that's. Oh, yeah.
3685000	3689000	No, it's it's fucking serious. So anyway, so companies reacting.
3689000	3694000	Yes. So like, of course, you know, companies had different responses to that.
3694000	3701000	So Microsoft said, you know, E3 has always been important to us, but they're going to do a digital event instead,
3701000	3704000	which they'll release the details of those soon.
3704000	3710000	Nintendo, you know, they said they support the ESA's decision to cancel the event.
3710000	3715000	Of course, they're going to be, you know, doing I think their own digital event as well.
3715000	3721000	Ubisoft is looking to do a digital event.
3721000	3726000	EA, I thought that was funny that they really talked EA and like they're not fucking going.
3726000	3730000	Who cares what EA thinks? And they usually rent the thing across the street.
3730000	3737000	Yeah. They said, no, we're continuing to follow the coronavirus developments around the world very closely.
3737000	3744000	And we will be reviewing how that changed our plans or how that may change our plans for EA Play 2020.
3744000	3746000	Devolver Digital. That was also a funny one, too.
3746000	3751000	We could be three has always been a big part of what we do and genuinely bumped about the cancellation event.
3751000	3757000	So lots of joke right now, but we have the live stream Devolver Direct and press conference and possibly more.
3757000	3761000	Their shit's always crazy anyways. And it's Square Enix.
3761000	3768000	You know, they've I think they're probably going to do something digital as well.
3768000	3774000	Well, we'll we'll see. I mean, if even if the consoles don't happen, the game certainly will.
3774000	3777000	So because they've been in development for a long time.
3777000	3783000	Oh, I forgot to ask, since it came out already, did you get a chance to play the Space Channel five VR game?
3783000	3786000	I didn't. I kind of missed that. I need to go back and catch up on that.
3786000	3792000	So just obviously I've been distracted with everything else going on. So, yeah, I want to check that out for sure.
3792000	3796000	Speaking of VR, actually, it's funny. I saw a picture the other day.
3796000	3802000	Apparently they did. They added a VR like thing to Roosevelt Golf Land.
3802000	3806000	So they actually have like a place where you can play like Beat Saber and stuff like that.
3806000	3811000	Oh, it's kind of fun. It's kind of cool. Well, but it's probably closed right now because I heard a lot of VR arcades.
3811000	3818000	That's it. And even though even though they sanitize everything between people, it's just a weird, crazy world right now.
3818000	3822000	All right. A world so crazy that these rumors are coming up.
3822000	3827000	And this is this is a big one about Silent Hills possibly coming back.
3827000	3834000	Of course, this is the PT demo playable trailer from years ago on the PlayStation four.
3834000	3840000	We all know that, you know, Kojima, Konami, they had a falling out. Kojima kind of left and made Death Stranding instead.
3840000	3844000	And but he's been kind of teasing this whole return to horror type of thing.
3844000	3848000	What the hell is going on with Silent Hill? May it be coming back?
3848000	3854000	Well, this is, again, rumors, but it's rumors coming from sources that have been right before.
3854000	3861000	You kind of have a track record going on. It's Twitter folks, aesthetic gamer and rely on horror talking about what's happening here.
3861000	3868000	So apparently there is a Silent Hill reboot game coming for the PlayStation five and it's coming from S.I.E. Japan.
3868000	3873000	And it's being helmed by Keishiro Toyama, who is the director and writer of the original Silent Hill.
3873000	3878000	Masahiro Ito, who did all the creature designs with the first game for four games.
3878000	3883000	And our pal Akira Yamaoka, who did the music. That would be amazing.
3883000	3887000	So, I mean, that is how we team fucking amazing. Yeah, that is a dream team of people.
3887000	3893000	So we'll see. You know, they're saying it's not yet a done deal, but Kojima would be involved.
3893000	3899000	Apparently the rumor and this is this is why I'm kind of like, you know, again, our old favorite plausibility.
3899000	3905000	Ready that Sony may have played mediator between Kojima and Konami to make this happen.
3905000	3912000	I could kind of believe it. Sony is going to need some exclusives to keep the PlayStation five competitive.
3912000	3918000	And I've talked before on a previous episode that, you know, Konami's biggest strength right now, they're not really making games.
3918000	3924000	I mean, sure. There was the Bomberman thing, but their games haven't been very like the last Metal Gear Solid game.
3924000	3930000	Crap. I mean, no, no. Metal Gear Survive or whatever. That was bullshit. That wasn't a Kojima game.
3930000	3934000	Yeah. And then then there was the Contra game, which is kind of.
3934000	3939000	So they've been struggling a lot and they've been going to the outside a lot like those collections.
3939000	3943000	That was all those same people that are doing the arcade game releases on Switch and stuff.
3943000	3950000	Sorry, I forget their name, but they're that's doing all that stuff. So, you know, they're getting help with all these projects.
3950000	3952000	So Konami's biggest strength is its IP.
3952000	3959000	So if they're going to loan that IP to somebody like Sony to make a good game, to make that IP stronger.
3959000	3967000	So Konami can then turn around and make slot machine games out of it and sell the IP into figurines and things like that, then it would make good business sense.
3967000	3971000	So there are a lot of elements of this that make sense.
3971000	3979000	It's just when you start to name names and it is the dream team of people you would want working on this, where you start to get a little bit skeptical.
3979000	3988000	And that's where the plausibility starts to go, is that this is really a dream team of people and it's going to be a hell of a thing if they really were to get all these people together.
3989000	3998000	Apparently Sony pitched to Kojima making Silent Hills similar to Until Dawn, where it's a narrative driven experience, also kind of like The Walking Dead.
3998000	4002000	So yeah, we'll see.
4002000	4005000	Sounds like a new VR game to go along with it.
4005000	4021000	Yeah, now these rumors are kind of also kind of spinning into this, that Sony may actually have a thing with Konami that involves not just Silent Hill, but Metal Gear and Castlevania, all the big IPs as well.
4021000	4030000	That one is like a 4chan thing. So I think we're kind of like, okay, Jan, you know, we're not totally on board with that yet. That's a little bit more pie in the sky thing.
4030000	4034000	But you know where there's smoke, who knows?
4034000	4045000	Shad Starzik or Shane is in our chat right now saying the rumor is two different games, one from Kojima and one from Ito Yamaoka Toyama, so they'd not be crossing over.
4045000	4054000	But of course, this is so fake sounding. Yeah, and that's right. I had heard that one is like a Silent Hill reboot and the other is Silent Hills Realized.
4054000	4058000	Having two games around the same time, that doesn't make a lot of sense.
4058000	4061000	Maybe one for the PlayStation 4 this year and one for the...
4061000	4065000	I mean, what if it's just a fucking Silent Hill remaster?
4065000	4068000	They've already...
4068000	4071000	They did two and three and it won great.
4071000	4076000	Yeah, they really shit on that one.
4076000	4077000	I don't know.
4077000	4081000	Maybe something to hold us over until an actual Silent Hills is ready. I don't know.
4081000	4086000	Azet pointing out Castlevania Dope, Netflix's original Silent Hill anime.
4086000	4093000	That's true is that Castlevania is getting a lot of eyes on it again because the anime is doing very well and just had its third season.
4093000	4095000	Ooh, a Silent Hill anime would be pretty sweet.
4095000	4109000	Right? But again, if Konami could get the strength back in those IPs by having good games, they could have the leverage to sell a Silent Hill anime, TV, who knows type of thing to Netflix similar to what they have with Castlevania.
4109000	4117000	So again, it makes sense for Konami to start to let their game development go into other hands a little bit.
4117000	4119000	And it could be a win-win move for Sony.
4119000	4125000	But I realize a lot of it is fan wank and feels like fan wank, so don't hedge your bets on it.
4125000	4127000	But I thought it was worth bringing up.
4127000	4134000	You know, Silent Hills as a PlayStation 5 exclusive would make a lot of sense. It would make a lot of people happy.
4134000	4136000	And Sony knows that.
4136000	4138000	And I think that's key too.
4138000	4140000	Sony knows that.
4140000	4142000	We'll see if it comes to fruition.
4142000	4153000	And I think a Sony exclusive, like Silent Hill title that's of like caliber of like Metal Gear Solid 4 or something like that, you know, where that's going to bring a lot of money into Konami.
4153000	4157000	A lot more than their shitty attempt at a game would be.
4157000	4163000	And by the way, Dartusuhi in chat says, I didn't think Contra Rogue Corps was as bad as people were saying.
4163000	4165000	Well, that looked pretty damn terrible to me.
4165000	4168000	I mean, different folks like different games.
4168000	4172000	And sometimes, you know, games that not everybody likes might be a thing that you're really into.
4172000	4175000	We talked about this on a previous show, like bad games that you still love.
4175000	4177000	So it happens sometimes.
4177000	4180000	And I want to say, I haven't played it, so I have no opinion on it yet.
4180000	4187000	Maybe I'll have plenty of time with all this sudden time to sit at home to catch up on some of that stuff.
4187000	4188000	So we'll see.
4188000	4189000	All right, moving on.
4189000	4192000	Some big changes with other properties.
4192000	4199000	Yeah, you know, like if it was a different time, I'd probably be well, first off, I'd have to be excited about sports games, which I'm not.
4199000	4207000	But like if I if it's still if it was a different time and 2K wasn't what they are today, I might be more excited.
4207000	4213000	But 2K is going to be producing an NFL game this year.
4213000	4217000	It's going to be the first after like it's been like since 2K 15.
4217000	4219000	So 16 years.
4219000	4230000	And apparently, you know, since the NFL's been exclusively in EA game for a while now, this will be interesting to see some competition.
4230000	4235000	The bad part about that is it's 2K games now.
4235000	4244000	It's the same 2K that put out the fucking gambling loot boxes and NBA 2K and shit all over WWE.
4244000	4249000	With their 2K game that just came out last year, that is buggy and broken as shit.
4249000	4261000	And then you have also, of course, the wonderful parts of NBA 2K 20 that rely on stats from actual league games, the My League mode.
4261000	4268000	Well, because the NBA has suspended their games, it's fucking broken.
4269000	4271000	So, yeah.
4272000	4277000	Bobby Black Wolf in chat was point out regarding the 2K NFL game, it is not a simulation NFL game.
4277000	4280000	It will be an arcade game. It will not compete with Madden.
4280000	4283000	Madden will still be the only simulation NFL game.
4283000	4287000	So it'll be kind of like what was that Super Nintendo game?
4287000	4291000	Yeah. Yeah. But you know what, though, it's still I am super high impact.
4291000	4294000	It's still going to be a game.
4294000	4297000	I mean, yeah. So it's a little bit more NBA jam than it is mad.
4297000	4305000	But still, it's people are looking for a better game because all it is, it's been just, you know, EA Sports.
4305000	4308000	And it's just the same damn game churned out year after year.
4308000	4314000	And I wish I'd say the NBA 2K was better than that, but it's not at this point.
4314000	4316000	It's the same damn game churned out every single year.
4316000	4321000	So at least there's some competition now.
4321000	4324000	So maybe that'll mean it's better.
4325000	4327000	Really random question. I'm sorry to bring it up.
4327000	4331000	But, you know, the talk of the NFL thing and some people have kind of talked about, well,
4331000	4337000	if there is an NFL next year and so forth with everything that's going on, why won't they just play games in empty stadiums?
4337000	4339000	Like, I thought that was kind of like what they were doing.
4339000	4341000	In some cases, they would just play the games in empty stadiums.
4341000	4345000	But I feel like because I may not be a sports person, you may not be a sports person.
4345000	4349000	Maybe they don't make enough money. They make a lot money of everyone coming in.
4349000	4351000	People need entertainment more than ever right now.
4351000	4354000	So why won't they still play the games?
4354000	4357000	I mean, is it just they don't want the players come into contact with each other or something?
4357000	4360000	Well, maybe that's what happened in the NBA. I don't know.
4360000	4362000	I totally admit my ignorance to this, you guys.
4362000	4365000	But why won't they just play the games in empty stadiums and still allow people to watch it?
4365000	4367000	Maybe, you know, I guess they have to charge for it.
4367000	4370000	Didn't they have to test the whole team for the Utah Jazz or something like that?
4370000	4372000	Or who the fuck state the Jazz is with it?
4372000	4373000	Yeah, he was with the Utah team.
4373000	4375000	But I'm just, I don't know.
4375000	4378000	Like with Broadway, Broadway freaking getting shut down.
4378000	4381000	It's like people, people still need to be entertained.
4381000	4384000	Can't we put on those shows and like a closed circuit television type of thing?
4384000	4388000	I don't I don't know. Some of that's going to have to be reevaluated, I think.
4388000	4392000	This is now Disney's putting out Frozen 2 way earlier than they were originally going to.
4392000	4398000	And I think the episode nine of Star Wars came out earlier than it was originally supposed to, at least on like digital types of platforms.
4398000	4406000	So like some companies are kind of realizing, oh, we may have to change the way we're thinking about this a little bit and being stuff directly in the homes because everybody's a home now.
4406000	4411000	So I don't know. Yeah. Interesting.
4411000	4417000	As J-100 Matt in chat says, the CDC recommended that if you shouldn't have gatherings more than 50 people,
4417000	4422000	if you include players and personnel, TV crew, et cetera, you can't do a game with under 50 people.
4422000	4425000	TV crews by themselves are over 50 people for a game. All right.
4426000	4428000	Can't they remotely do that for a moment?
4428000	4438000	I mean, or like maybe let's hope that if we are looking at squishing the curve and we see that maybe decline is starting to happen within a few weeks,
4438000	4444000	can we maybe at least get to and I would I would hope to fuck in a couple of weeks testing is going to be way more readily available.
4444000	4447000	I mean, crossing my fingers, my toes and maybe I'm just being an idiot.
4447000	4452000	But I really, really would hope that testing is going to be more readily available in the next couple of weeks because it's badly needed.
4452000	4456000	Like then they get to kind of like test people easier. And I think that's what it's going to take.
4456000	4461000	Once people can kind of like know their status, then they can know how to proceed appropriately.
4461000	4465000	And that's, I think, going to be a big thing. Yeah. I don't know.
4465000	4470000	Again, I don't want to get too far off topic, but I just feel like that's I don't know.
4470000	4478000	All right. Moving on. Other things that are not going to be happening due to world events.
4478000	4483000	The TurboGrafx-16 Mini. Remember that? That was supposed to be out this month. The TurboGrafx-16 was supposed to happen in March.
4483000	4489000	Yeah, I remember I preordered one on Amazon. I was waiting on that, but it's been delayed until further notice.
4489000	4494000	It was supposed to be out on March 19th. Yeah, definitely the events of what's going on in the real world.
4494000	4500000	I'm like, you know, it's it's fine. Got that limited data cap. Now you can go download all those ROMs.
4500000	4504000	It does put things into perspective a little bit. Right. So, yeah.
4504000	4512000	And it's due to supply issues being caused by things that are being shut down and harder to deal with because of COVID or novel coronavirus.
4512000	4518000	Konami in a statement put on their website regarding PC Engine CoreGrafx Mini console and its peripheral accessories.
4518000	4525000	The manufacturing and shipping facilities in China have encountered an unavoidable suspension due to the current coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak.
4525000	4533000	As a result, the delivery of all PC Engine CoreGrafx Mini products, which was originally scheduled for March 19th, will be delayed until further notice.
4533000	4540000	They've been they've been getting the numbers in China down. Right. Like it's not gone. It's far from it. But China is coming down.
4540000	4551000	Right. So hopefully, again, maybe I'm just being stupidly optimistic, but hopefully in the next couple of weeks, maybe we can start seeing reality move again.
4551000	4556000	Maybe. So, yeah. And then we can get our TurboGrafx-16 minis, I guess.
4556000	4563000	So Dark Sakura is like, I'll just play I can play my arcade CDs or a dual RX because she has the original stuff.
4563000	4569000	But yeah, I don't have a real TurboGrafx, so I have to use the fake one.
4569000	4576000	So I would have been looking forward to that. But I completely understand. Like, I'm not like I'm not going to angry tweet.
4576000	4583000	Like it's one of those things where it's like if if the concession I have to make here is that I don't get a TurboGrafx-16 this month.
4583000	4587000	It's not that big a deal. All things considered, I'll have nothing to play.
4587000	4594000	Six hundred games in my steam library. Exactly. There's nothing to play.
4594000	4601000	All right. Let's move on. Loki, this should be some news that excites you. It does excite me because I fucking love Lego.
4601000	4608000	I like Lego, too. It's one of those things. Exactly. I do more of I have a very hidden obsession with like now.
4608000	4615000	So this is very exciting. They announced a whole bunch of sets that are going to be coming that are Super Mario Bros themed.
4615000	4625000	And what's unique about these, though, is the actual character that they have has like a digital display built in for the eyes, mouth and like kind of upper torso.
4625000	4637000	So it interacts with a bunch of other play features that you build, like, for example, coins or you can stomp on a goomba and it makes like a smashing stuff.
4637000	4644000	There's like a bunch like the flag poles and everything. So no idea how much this is going to cost or when it's going to come out.
4644000	4654000	But it's very interesting what they've got here. And I will definitely pick up a bunch of this stuff. But yeah.
4654000	4662000	I'm excited. I'm definitely going to be picking this up. Nintendo seems to be licensing out their IP for all sorts of interesting tie ins lately.
4662000	4668000	I saw it's not on our show tonight, but I saw somewhere on a tweet or something. They had a deal going with Levi's jeans as well.
4668000	4674000	There's going to be like Nintendo type of jeans. Yeah. I saw like one design where like coins were kind of like falling out of the back pocket.
4674000	4681000	Cool. Maybe a little more for kids. Like, I don't know if I would go so far to wear those, but I would maybe I totally wear that.
4681000	4686000	But who knows? I like the shoes that look like Nintendo controllers. And I always love good socks.
4686000	4691000	Look at my socks. It's probably hard to see. They have a little sushi on them right now, but I love my cute socks.
4691000	4699000	Well, as I was going to say, there's also yet another set that Lego might be making. Now, this is not necessarily a guarantee.
4699000	4707000	So Lego has this whole page where it's Lego ideas and basically with the idea sets.
4707000	4710000	Isn't that where people submit their dream stuff and like the RuPaul's Drag Race?
4710000	4717000	Sort of. Yeah. Yeah. It was in the running, but they did so. Yeah. So what happens is they basically submit ideas.
4717000	4723000	You can. It's pretty easy nowadays. They have the whole brick. Oh, God, what the hell?
4723000	4732000	Stud I.O. It's like the studio thing that you can actually build with digital Legos and build sets and render them to look like like an actual set.
4732000	4736000	And then what's cool about those is like you can even take the parts and piece it out.
4736000	4745000	And there's a second hand site which now is owned by Lego called Brick Link that you can outsource all that stuff and literally get the pieces to build your own sets.
4745000	4750000	So that existed years ago. I remember dealing with eight bit art type of things.
4750000	4755000	Well, yeah. Lego had their own thing where you can order through them. But this is these are all second hand sellers.
4755000	4759000	It's not directly through Lego. You can still do the Lego stuff as well.
4759000	4765000	And they used to have their own Lego digital studio thing that you could order directly through that and even make the manuals and stuff.
4765000	4772000	But this actually creates mail as well. Anyways, long story short, some folks have put together a Sonic the Hedgehog set.
4772000	4777000	You may remember that Lego did a Sonic the Hedgehog set sort of with Lego dimensions.
4777000	4784000	And so they had actual Sonic the Hedgehog minifigs and then they had a whole bunch of levels of stuff built there.
4784000	4793000	But they have in this one, it looks like a Green Hill Zone set that this guy put together with Sonic,
4793000	4800000	a bunch of the animals. We have a giant Dr. Robotnik mech and some of the other robots in the game.
4800000	4804000	And I believe that they have reached their 10,000 supporters.
4804000	4814000	So that means that this is going to be one of the sets that they're going to look at as a possibility to make into a real set.
4814000	4816000	And it all depends on like licensing and stuff like that.
4816000	4822000	Some other sets, like I've gotten quite a few of these before that Lego idea says I have a fishing store that's pretty awesome.
4822000	4830000	The Treehouse, which is cool. But there's some more like popular brands that like the Friends, they have the Central Perk from Friends.
4830000	4837000	You may remember they also have from Big Bang Theory, the like couch in the apartment or whatever, Flintstones.
4837000	4841000	They did even Steamboat Willie with a collaboration with Disney and stuff like that.
4841000	4845000	Bobby was just saying in chat that was the one he just put together was the Steamboat Willie.
4845000	4849000	Yeah. So a lot more people tinkering with Lego this downtime.
4849000	4853000	Tron, the Tron light bikes. That was also another Lego ideas one as well.
4853000	4856000	So Disney seems to be pretty safe because they work with them anyways.
4856000	4865000	But this would be pretty cool. I would definitely dig seeing some more game stuff come out at the very least.
4865000	4869000	I like the Brickhead stuff as well, but it'd be cool to see what happens with this.
4869000	4875000	So this will go into there. I think they do a quarterly kind of evaluation of whether it's going to become a real set or not.
4875000	4882000	And then once they do that, then they work with Lego designers to actually figure out like they need to tweak it or whatever.
4882000	4885000	By the way, on related notes, it's like Sonic is all the rage right now.
4885000	4891000	Did you hear that the Sonic the Hedgehog movie just passed Pokemon or excuse me,
4891000	4895000	Detective Pikachu to become the top grossing video game movie period. Cool.
4895000	4898000	Yeah. Sadly, with the crews and everything, I never got around to seeing it.
4898000	4902000	And now running out and seeing a movie isn't exactly at the top of my things to do.
4902000	4908000	I would if they put it out digital, like in the next couple of weeks, I would totally pay for it to watch it in my home.
4908000	4912000	So maybe that'll be a thing that'll happen. I don't know. I don't know what's going to happen to movie theaters.
4912000	4917000	Like, you know, because all the all the movies are getting delayed, right?
4917000	4921000	Some of them. Yeah. Yeah. So so weird.
4921000	4929000	I bet you see a lot more classic movies being screened to try to pass to try to kind of bide the time over a little bit.
4929000	4934000	Well, there's lots of series definitely to watch. You know, that's for sure.
4934000	4939000	I wanted to check out. There's this show freaks or it's a movie freaks.
4939000	4942000	It looks pretty cool, kind of like a mutant thing. They have Netflix.
4942000	4945000	It's a lot of shows that like deep cuts you can get into.
4945000	4949000	And speaking of movies, you know, I was supposed to be in a performance of Clue, the movie.
4949000	4952000	We're going to be doing a shadow catch up on a good place.
4952000	4954000	Yeah, I can't finally catch up with a good place.
4954000	4956000	Supposed to say I was I was supposed to be in a shadow cast.
4956000	4960000	This all had this all like came and went while we were out. But I was going to be playing Mr.
4960000	4964000	Green. And if you've seen the movie from the 80s, you know, that's kind of funny casting for me.
4964000	4968000	So I was gonna be playing Mr. Green in the clue shadow cast here in Sacramento.
4968000	4972000	That was supposed to be April 11th. Well, that has been not canceled. It's been postponed.
4972000	4976000	They actually are getting a Leslie and Warren who played Miss Scarlet movie to be there.
4976000	4981000	And she you know, because of all the travel concerns, she's she's older. You know, she's in her 70s.
4981000	4986000	So they she's kind of asked if they could do it at a different day and it certainly makes sense.
4986000	4991000	But now the new days in June and I'm like, I hope that was long enough out, you know.
4991000	5002000	But at least I do hope if we all get this thing eliminated, you know, within the next six weeks or reduced significantly to the point where we don't have to worry as much.
5002000	5006000	If in the next six weeks or whatever, then, you know, this could be one of the first big events.
5006000	5012000	Oh, we can come back and do this thing. That'll be fun. That would be cool. So it'd be really nice. So. All right. Anyway.
5012000	5016000	Yeah. Fifth dream today in chat says, I'm glad mad they delayed new mutants again.
5016000	5021000	I want to see it so much, but not during this 14 year old me still needs that damn movie to exist.
5021000	5027000	I've been waiting 30 years. Yeah, I've been I've been hearing that. Tiger Klein chats talking about the Sonic movie says,
5027000	5033000	also, the Sonic movie came out in time before this coronavirus thing. If it came out in this time, it wouldn't get those numbers.
5033000	5036000	Yeah. The timing, you know, what kind of said this when the movie came out?
5036000	5042000	I think the timing in February, despite the virus stuff, the timing of February really worked out in his favor.
5042000	5047000	I think it just inherently did better as a February movie than it would have in the fall when it was originally supposed to happen.
5047000	5053000	So I think despite that whole CGI thing being weird, I think it actually ended up working out in its favor in the long run.
5053000	5061000	So. All right. Anyway, moving on, let's talk about something interesting related to PlayStation four dreams,
5061000	5064000	which is on my list of things I need to get to now that I'm back on the cruise.
5064000	5074000	It really want to check this out. Yeah, my number one list or number one thing I need to do is move my PlayStation four to my desk because I can't get near the TV,
5074000	5081000	which is too bad because, you know, 4K and everything. But I'll I'll take 1080, I guess.
5081000	5085000	Well, I love Media Molecule stuff. Little Big Planet was amazing and I loved all those games.
5085000	5090000	So, of course, I want to check out dreams and I just, you know, maybe I just need to get a 4K wrap around monitor.
5090000	5095000	Yeah. With everything going on in the world, I haven't had a chance to check out dreams yet, but I hope to get to it.
5095000	5100000	But some of you are already in there. You're playing with it. You're having a good time with it and building things in it.
5100000	5104000	And you might be building your own game. You might be building some art in it.
5104000	5114000	And what's interesting, Media Molecule has now launched a beta evaluation program that is going to allow dream creators to sell their work off PlayStation,
5114000	5118000	meaning things like a music video or a poster.
5118000	5123000	So kind of like art that is inspired by things that you've done in the game.
5123000	5126000	You still own the rights to the original creations and dreams.
5126000	5131000	They just want to make it easier for you to profit from that work. You are not guaranteed to get in this program.
5131000	5134000	You have to join the early access program. You have to be in good standing.
5134000	5141000	So if you made World of Dicks, you're probably not going to get into the beta or like all the other like weird meme things.
5141000	5147000	Yeah. Or if your entire thing is based off a copyright infringement, probably not going to work out so well for you.
5147000	5149000	Especially if it's World of Dicks.
5149000	5155000	Yeah, especially World of Dicks. But yeah, Media Molecule wants to know what are you doing, when are you going to finish it and so forth.
5155000	5165000	So they're going to ask a lot of questions. So, yeah, this could be an interesting way for artists to develop things in this very strange time right now.
5165000	5168000	But I can't wait to get in there and see what people are coming up with.
5168000	5176000	It's a game I need to actually pick up. I think, I don't know, though, like I picked up the last LittleBigPlanet like that as well.
5176000	5179000	Yeah, I'm really going to dive in there, play all those games.
5179000	5182000	Oh, if you haven't played LittleBigPlanet 3, it's great.
5182000	5187000	Yeah, I love that it would play the old stuff from one and two as well is really nice.
5187000	5192000	So being able to kind of upgrade all of that. So. All right, let's move on.
5192000	5199000	We're going to go back to a segment recorded earlier today with DarkSakura and get into the classic game of the week.
5199000	5204000	Or, you know, once a month we do something a little bit different. So let's get to that right now.
5204000	5212000	All right. So as promised, I'm back and DarkSakura back on the Discord with us earlier in the day. Hello.
5212000	5213000	Hi.
5213000	5220000	So you know what? It's going to take more than the big C to stop you from bringing us the classic game of the week.
5220000	5226000	So every week DarkSakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be checking this game out.
5226000	5235000	But once a month in 2020, DarkSakura instead decides to play a little pinball with the classic pinball table of the month.
5235000	5237000	So DarkSakura, what did you pick for us?
5237000	5244000	I picked Doctor Who. So far I picked tables that are all ones that I own.
5244000	5255000	Funny enough, Doctor Who is on the other side of where my World Cup soccer is. Right in between it is Black Rose, which you might hear about later.
5255000	5264000	So Doctor Who came out. Well, not the original show because the original show started in 1963.
5264000	5275000	But the pinball table was released in September 1992, manufactured by Midway using the Midway WPC Fliptronics II system.
5275000	5284000	It was designed by I'm going to butcher this guy's name, Bill Flutzenreuter and Barry Alsler.
5284000	5289000	Artwork was done by Linda Deal. Really, really decent artwork.
5289000	5297000	But it had some voices in the game taken directly from episodes of Doctor Who.
5297000	5306000	They did get Sylvester McCoy, who was the seventh doctor, to record some lines for it, which was really good.
5306000	5312000	They had Brian Miller as the Daleks.
5312000	5322000	He did pass away not long ago, but he also was married to Liz Slaton, who was Sarah Jean Smith in the show.
5322000	5329000	And they had Terry Molloy as Davros, who had played Davros in the series.
5329000	5339000	You also, you know, with the game, you go through it because it came out before that movie came out in the US.
5339000	5344000	So you do have all of the seven doctors that were out for now.
5344000	5350000	So you had the first doctor by William Hartnell. He has each of the doctors have their own modes in it.
5350000	5357000	His mode awards an extra escape letter each time a shot is made so you can get the video mode faster.
5357000	5361000	The second doctor was Patrick Troughton.
5361000	5367000	He gives you more time to make the combo shot for the hang on target.
5367000	5373000	The third doctor, which is played by John Pertwee, gives you more time to shoot who the letters for that,
5373000	5376000	which is more chances for extra balls.
5376000	5385000	The fourth doctor, Tom Baker, gives you an easier repair letter, you know, thing time for the fifth doctor.
5385000	5393000	Doubles your jet bumper score, which gives you faster time to light the trash mat to collect your currently selected doctor.
5393000	5397000	The sixth doctor, Colin Baker, increases your play field multiplier.
5397000	5404000	And the seventh doctor, Sylvester Coy, awards an additional shot every time the up down target bank is hit,
5404000	5408000	which is the time expander that gives you faster multi balls.
5408000	5419000	So when you've got your lock lit and honestly, I stay mostly in seventh doctor mode and then I play in fifth doctor mode a lot.
5419000	5426000	Those are like my two modes because the seventh doctor, once you have your ball locked, you would on your next ball,
5426000	5433000	you switch to the seventh doctor and you can light up the mode.
5433000	5438000	You have to hit this like time expander thing to get a certain limit on it.
5438000	5446000	And then you get your multi ball faster, which then you can switch to another doctor if you're lucky enough to do that or you've collected the doctor.
5446000	5453000	So multi ball lights up after you've hit 15 time expander factors.
5453000	5465000	And so the mini play field will rise to the level three because you have like a rising level on there and then you have three gates that have a Dalek on it.
5465000	5473000	And so you have to shoot one of those or start the multi ball and then you have to bang on the Daleks for a while and they scream at you.
5473000	5481000	So other little bits and pieces with your, you know, with your ramps, you have a little TARDIS in there, which is great.
5481000	5497000	And then there the first hundred of the games that were released had a moving Dalek topper, you know, for the top of the marquee that would turn side to side as it was speaking.
5497000	5503000	They had a body in there with a motor cam and opto electronic system.
5503000	5515000	And it was pretty expensive that you can get the production Dalek toppers that you can get them with wobble head kits.
5515000	5522000	The prototype actually had the old Bally style back box and a different class altogether.
5522000	5528000	But then they changed it to the Williams style because it was cheaper for production.
5528000	5543000	The rule street, the rule sheet on it is pretty different from other pinballs, but it was really not conducive to the casual pinball player playing it, although I honestly enjoy it.
5543000	5548000	I have seen people really love it for tournament play.
5549000	5564000	But it was basically according to Flitzenreuter, the designer, that they made about a dozen sample games with a hundred prototypes before the real production released.
5564000	5570000	You know, like I said, they had the Dalek head that would move side to side.
5570000	5574000	They removed all those electronics from it to make it cheaper.
5574000	5578000	But the wiring and the software in the board is still intact.
5578000	5582000	So if you do buy an aftermarket kit, you can get that done.
5582000	5596000	And he said also that the way to tell if yours was going to have that, that Williams glued the stationary Dalek head under the body.
5596000	5603000	So if you're going to put those kits in there, you have to unglue that head off and that Williams used a lot of glue.
5603000	5614000	But you can look for irregular cuts or glue remnants and you know if yours has been retrofitted or if it was original because of the amount of glue that they used.
5614000	5621000	So there were different also prototype play fields that still went into production.
5621000	5630000	So for the machine number two, which is the prototype, if ever you're seeing this, the doctor's cape in the center play field is a solid color not tartan.
5630000	5638000	Some of the Daleks are a different color with different ball colors and the play field is a diamond plate.
5638000	5643000	The slogans that came out with it is the doctor is in and it's about time.
5643000	5655000	And there's a lot more that you can get on this. You can even unload the whole ROM set and artwork kit on the internet pinball database present.
5655000	5661000	That's IPDB.org and you want to look up Doctor Who for machine.
5661000	5667000	But that said, it's a really fun one. It's definitely a novel one.
5667000	5676000	It to me, it's a lot of fun, you know, especially for classic Who fans.
5676000	5683000	The it's got so many good voices in it every a treat to play if you're a Doctor Who fan.
5683000	5689000	It is complex. I will tell you this. The rule sets on it are freaking weird, but it's a lot of fun.
5689000	5694000	I've been playing a little bit of Doctor Who while I was on quarantine.
5694000	5704000	So if you find one out in the wild, treat it with care, play it, give it some love.
5704000	5713000	Because who knows, maybe we'll get a new Doctor Who down the line. You hear me, Stern or Jersey Jack or one of you folks?
5713000	5716000	Time to get on that for sure. We need a sequel.
5716000	5721000	There it is, your classic pinball table of the month, Doctor Who.
5721000	5728000	So thanks again, Jamie, for joining us long distance this week in light of everything that's going on.
5728000	5734000	Rest up. Try not to go to bonkers from all the self-isolation.
5734000	5738000	And I guess we'll see you in a couple of weeks. We'll probably have you on the show next week in one way or another.
5738000	5741000	But hopefully back live in a couple of weeks.
5741000	5744000	I've been harassing the cat, so she's quite put out.
5744000	5749000	All right. Until next time, Dark Sakura, thank you and feel better.
5749000	5750000	Will do. Bye, everybody.
5750000	5752000	We're thinking of you. Bye.
5754000	5758000	All right. I think that was that was it throwing me back to live.
5758000	5763000	Hi, me. Thank you, me. Here we are back live in our studio and the classic pinball table of the month.
5763000	5769000	I love that one. I love the Doctor Who table. So that that's a good, great highlight to hear from Dark Sakura there.
5769000	5774000	And hello to everybody who is watching in our chat room, because, of course, we do tape live on Sunday nights.
5774000	5777000	Today's been a little bit half live, half prior taped.
5777000	5781000	But a lot of things are a little weird right now with what's going on in the world.
5781000	5789000	But hope you all are being very safe and, you know, just taking all those precautions like we talked about earlier and not freaking out too much.
5789000	5793000	We'll get through this together. So anyway, let's get back into some news.
5793000	5796000	We have some rapid fire news to get to.
5796000	5809000	Yes. So there's a pretty cool prototype that someone made on itch.io for a first person Mario game that you shoot plungers at goombas and stuff like that.
5809000	5817000	And so this guy, Noonan, created this for the Mario holiday.
5817000	5822000	And March 10th happened. Yes, that's right. Yeah. That's when they announced the whole Lego Mario thing.
5822000	5827000	Yeah. You know, a lot of things because of, you know, the world just kind of got like, oh, yeah, that happened.
5827000	5832000	And March 10th is one of them. Pi Day was yesterday. You know, March three, one for Pi Day was yesterday.
5832000	5834000	Yes, I missed out on my free pizza.
5834000	5837000	People kind of forgot about that. Well, not everybody forgot.
5837000	5844000	Like I saw Jamie on Facebook talking about it. But for the most part, I think people kind of forgot to go out and get their pies.
5844000	5852000	Well, anyways, so Sean Noonan, he's been a level designer on several games like Far Cry and Watch Dogs.
5852000	5864000	But now he's put together a game called the Super 1-1 Challenge on itch.io and basically said it's part of a map core challenge.
5864000	5869000	It's some Discord campaign that tasks developers with reimagining classic video game levels.
5869000	5876000	So he did this in Unreal 4. And it's funny, he has a little trailer for it. It's talking about hire this guy.
5876000	5882000	You know, you made Mario in Unreal 4, but you can go check it out. It's name your price.
5882000	5890000	So the URL you want is Sean. That's S E A N dash Noonan.
5890000	5898000	N O O N A N dot itch dot IO slash super. That's pretty cool. Yes. Go check it out. And it's pretty awesome.
5898000	5901000	By the way, speaking of indie developers, just want to give a quick shout out to Y Y R.
5901000	5908000	As far as I know, Sharpshooter was released on Steam because somebody posted a thing in the Discord saying it was showing up in the recommended games.
5908000	5913000	I was playing that version. He gave us all a little early a couple of weeks ago on the show.
5913000	5918000	But I just want to make sure he got his proper shout out. So if you haven't already picked up a copy of Sharpshooter, get on that.
5918000	5924000	Yeah. And then, of course, this week we have the release of Doom 64.
5924000	5932000	But as an added bonus, there's going to be a brand new chapter added to the game. So that's pretty cool.
5932000	5938000	That's always neat to kind of see like stuff added to like really old games. Like it's like it's like a deleted scene or something that comes back.
5938000	5943000	Jason talked about this briefly in tonight's intro. But yeah. Yeah.
5943000	5951000	And then also, they said that with that, they're the game supports monitors with the refresh rates over 60 hertz.
5951000	5958000	And this is allow speeds above a thousand frames per second. I don't know if we need that much, but cool.
5958000	5964000	So I'll check that out as well. Never played Doom 64. A thousand frames does seem a little bit excessive.
5964000	5967000	It does seem like I didn't talk about it my gaming week,
5967000	5974000	but I did buy that Doom on PlayStation 4 that you can like log in and download the mods and things like that. It's cool.
5974000	5981000	You notice the 60 frames a second. It runs really smooth. But, you know, it's Doom from the 1990s, but it's still cool.
5981000	5985000	Yeah, I like playing it on controller. It's fun. So. All right.
5985000	5990000	Moving on to some other rapid fire news. So funny. It's funny that you brought up something that one of the guys from Watch Dogs was doing,
5990000	5994000	because it ties into this free games from the Epic Games Store.
5994000	5999000	There's Hype Mayhem out there listening. Actually, Hype Mayhem just gave a tip about on sale games.
5999000	6005000	Apparently, Mortal Kombat 4 is now out there digitally and it's on good old games right now for six bucks.
6005000	6008000	That's cool. I like I liked Mortal Kombat 4, actually.
6008000	6013000	I like like Tanya and some of the new characters that Mortal Kombat 4 kind of brought on us. That's cool.
6013000	6018000	Who's the air god? Fujin? Was that his name? I like Raiden, but air anyway. All right.
6018000	6024000	All right. Anyway. Well, getting into free games in the Epic Games Store, there are some free games available right now,
6024000	6031000	including Anodyne 2 Return to Dust, A Short Hike and Mutazione. I hope I said that right.
6031000	6035000	It's a little bit of a twisty name. But yeah, those games are all free right now.
6035000	6041000	Let's see. Anodyne 2 is jumping and driving on 3D landscapes. You shrink into 2D dungeons.
6041000	6047000	A Short Hike is where you hike and climb the mountainside of Hike Peak and you go to different areas, discover hidden treasure.
6047000	6052000	And Mutazione is a mutant soap opera where small town gossip meets the supernatural.
6052000	6061000	Well, that sounds like fun. But I bring up Watch Dogs because next week the free games are going to be the Stanley Parable and Watch Dogs.
6061000	6067000	The first one. So this is good. Another platform I won't play that game on because I own it on PlayStation 4 and have never played.
6067000	6072000	It was literally my first game on PlayStation 4 and I was super excited to get it.
6072000	6081000	And then I think I got. Oh, what was the game? It was.
6081000	6086000	I don't know, there was another first party game that was coming up that was like supernatural and stuff that was pretty awesome.
6086000	6093000	And I played that and said I never went because the two games I got originally with my PlayStation 4 were Destiny and Watch Dogs.
6093000	6095000	Neither one played ever.
6095000	6101000	I got my PlayStation 4 so early. It was like you had the free PlayStation Plus games of Contrast and Resogun.
6101000	6107000	And those are like the two games I played. There was one disk game I had too. But yeah, this is funny.
6107000	6114000	Anyway, so going on to another rapid fire story here. This one's about Pokemon Go and Wizards Unite.
6114000	6119000	As I'm sure you can understand Niantic has canceled community days related to these.
6119000	6125000	Abra day was supposed to be yesterday. That did not end up happening. I'm sure I don't need to talk about why.
6125000	6131000	But it is worth bringing up if you weren't already aware. I know not everybody is playing Pokemon Go.
6131000	6138000	But if you open up the game right now for one coin. So if you've like ever put something in a gym for 10 minutes, you have one coin.
6138000	6146000	So for one coin, you can get a pack of 30 incense right now. And apparently incense in the game right now is pretty good.
6146000	6153000	Incense will last for an hour and seems to be bringing up Pokemon pretty regularly without you actually having to walk.
6153000	6159000	This is the game rural players wanted. And it's going to be interesting because it's going to probably make a lot of people go,
6159000	6166000	why can't you keep it this way? Because apparently it's not just like Pidgey and Rattatas and the equivalent trash from others.
6166000	6168000	I haven't played Pokemon Go in a while.
6168000	6173000	Yeah, but apparently the incense right now is pretty good. So if you haven't already gotten on the deal, I thought I would mention that.
6173000	6179000	So no news yet as to when these things will be rescheduled, but I'm sure you have more important things to worry about right now.
6179000	6184000	But those are things that did happen this week. So that is that.
6184000	6192000	By the way, speaking of Pokemon Go, I was talking with ActDeft while the Classic Game of the Week video was playing.
6192000	6198000	And ActDeft is going to do a stream after OLR tonight where he's actually going to kind of walk us through the Pokemon Go battle league.
6198000	6203000	So if you haven't played in a while and you're kind of curious, like what's all this battle PVP stuff about, ActDeft knows a little bit about that.
6203000	6206000	So we're going to raid him after the show tonight and take a look at that.
6206000	6212000	So for those of you that are listening live, for those of you that are not here live, you'll have to see if he's archiving his stuff so you can watch it on demand later.
6212000	6214000	So that'll be fun. So check that out.
6214000	6220000	Tigerclaw in chat says, I sent Bobby and Rob a gift in Pokemon Go and you guys haven't opened them in months.
6220000	6226000	OK, I'm sorry. I have been really bad at that. I did play a shit ton of Pokemon Go when I was on the cruise.
6226000	6231000	But Tigerclaw, you are in this weird exception thing and here's why.
6231000	6237000	Because I had all these gifts from Florida, the Bahamas and those areas.
6237000	6242000	I wanted to send them to all my friends who don't get gifts from those areas.
6242000	6247000	And unfortunately, Tigerclaw, you're one of two friends on my list, the other one being X-Link.
6247000	6250000	I kind of ignored because I was like, well, they're already in Florida.
6250000	6254000	So these Florida gifts are not going to be a big, yes, it might be a different part of Florida.
6254000	6259000	But since you're in Florida already, I didn't think it would be a big deal.
6259000	6265000	But I will try to get back on that and send you some California gifts, which might be a little bit of a bigger deal.
6265000	6270000	But the reality is I just haven't been super focused on Pokemon Go lately.
6270000	6273000	I've been playing like a little bit of Ingress.
6273000	6277000	But even with Ingress, I'm kind of like, well, actually, no, I take that back.
6277000	6280000	You know, I did I played some Ingress, ironically enough, earlier today.
6281000	6284000	I went down to one of the cemeteries near here.
6284000	6289000	And I did because Blue Team had a portal they were throwing dumb fields from I didn't like.
6289000	6290000	So I wanted to go take that one back.
6290000	6294000	And I was like, yeah, as long as I'm going to be there, I'm going to just micro-field the cemetery, get my AP.
6294000	6302000	And I got to say, amongst all this virus and self-isolation, all this talk, I can't think of a place that's more peaceful.
6302000	6304000	And some of you might think it's creepy and, well, sorry.
6304000	6308000	But I can't think of a place right now that was more peaceful and relaxing.
6308000	6313000	And the weather was very cooperative and nice than walking around that cemetery right earlier.
6313000	6317000	I know some people might think that's a little morbid, but, you know, I didn't I didn't find it that way.
6317000	6321000	I was really enjoying just kind of playing Ingress very easily at the cemetery.
6321000	6330000	You know, on a quick Ingress detour real quick, something they added in Ingress just like three days ago is portal scanning.
6330000	6337000	So now you take like a short little video of a portal where you're kind of walking around it best you can.
6337000	6341000	You try to get like 360s if you can, but some portals are hard to do.
6341000	6343000	So I might like do like a 180 or something.
6343000	6348000	And it actually takes, I guess, AR imagery of that and puts it on the server.
6348000	6349000	But they're not saying why.
6349000	6355000	They're just saying we're collecting AR data from portals and they're rewarding Ingress players with a badge for doing it.
6355000	6359000	So if you if you play a lot of Pokemon Go and you play a lot of Harry Potter,
6359000	6362000	but you don't really have your finger on the pulse of what's happening in Ingress.
6362000	6372000	Just know this Niantic is collecting more advanced AR data from a variety of Pokestops in the same location database right now.
6372000	6374000	Why? We don't know.
6374000	6378000	But the assumption is they're going to do something with Pokemon.
6378000	6383000	And like maybe I would think like maybe if they actually scan these different areas,
6383000	6390000	then the game is going to know like if a Pokemon wants to interact with the area and actually like climb things and walk around it,
6390000	6392000	they're going to have the data to be able to do that.
6392000	6398000	So that could be if I'm not just hypothesizing, that could be a thing that could be happening pretty soon.
6398000	6404000	We'll see. Anyway, sorry, that wasn't very rapid, but I thought that was an interesting thing worth bringing up.
6404000	6408000	And besides, after release dates, we get to emails and I'll just spoil it now.
6408000	6414000	We don't have any emails tonight, so I'll spend a little extra time talking about Pokemon and all that stuff.
6414000	6416000	But we will talk a little bit about world release dates.
6417000	6421000	So let's travel around the world and see what do we have to look forward to this week to save us from boredom?
6421000	6424000	I don't know. A few games here and there.
6424000	6431000	Only two games that have constantly had fanfic with crossover about each other for months.
6431000	6437000	Those games being, of course, MLB Show 20 on PlayStation 4 and Doom 64,
6437000	6442000	as previously mentioned on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6442000	6450000	But if you're not as sure as to need one of those, then we also have Doom Eternal coming out, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC and Stadia.
6450000	6456000	And then, of course, Animal Crossing New Horizons out on Nintendo Switch this week.
6458000	6461000	I'm sure many people are really excited about Animal Crossing. I know I am.
6461000	6467000	So if you felt tonight was too much talk about COVID-related stuff, just wait for next week.
6467000	6469000	It's going to be the Animal Crossing show.
6470000	6472000	Loki, you're getting Animal Crossing, right?
6473000	6474000	Of course.
6474000	6477000	It's like the one game your wife loves, isn't it?
6477000	6480000	She's like, I'm not going to play that game.
6482000	6483000	Give it time.
6483000	6484000	Give it time.
6484000	6486000	I feel like somebody amongst the three of us.
6486000	6488000	It's the same game every time.
6488000	6490000	I'm like, give it time.
6490000	6495000	You're going to play it and you're going to play it hard.
6495000	6499000	Somebody amongst the three of us needs to at least peek at Doom Eternal.
6502000	6503000	Alright, anyway.
6503000	6506000	Well, it's so nice of Jamie to volunteer for that job.
6506000	6507000	Oh, yeah.
6507000	6510000	You know what happens when you don't show up to a meeting. You get assigned all the work.
6510000	6514000	So Dark Sakura, the Doom Eternal review is on you, so good luck with that.
6515000	6516000	I'm teasing, of course.
6516000	6520000	Alright, traveling over to Japan and checking out the releases in Japan this week.
6520000	6525000	On the Nintendo Switch, of course, Animal Crossing New Horizons is also out in Japan this week.
6525000	6526000	That should be no surprise there.
6526000	6529000	All sorts of accessories and things like that to go with it.
6529000	6533000	So if you're looking for Animal Crossing branded crap for your Switch, you can get that.
6533000	6538000	The actual Nintendo Switch with Animal Crossing branding is also released in Japan this week.
6538000	6541000	That came out here in the US for some reason this past week.
6541000	6546000	I don't know why, but it did because I know Shane got one of those and went out and got it early.
6546000	6547000	So there is that.
6547000	6548000	So that's cool.
6548000	6550000	You can check that out in Japan this week.
6550000	6553000	That is pretty much dominating the conversation when it comes to Japan.
6553000	6560000	There is one other release, Ayu Densetsu Sen no Kisuke 3, that is also out on the Switch this week.
6560000	6562000	Trying to see what kind of game that is.
6564000	6567000	It looks like kind of like a fighting-ish game.
6567000	6570000	Explore the newly annexed lands of the empire with a brand new squad.
6570000	6576000	Experience an epic story developed across three titles and crafted for new and old fans.
6576000	6580000	Challenge oncoming threats with a combat system that has been refined over the course of decades.
6580000	6583000	So I guess these games have been out for some time.
6584000	6588000	Going over to the PlayStation 4, because they have some games coming out as well.
6588000	6590000	Subnautica is getting a Japanese release.
6590000	6592000	So that's been out here for years.
6592000	6593000	Yes.
6593000	6596000	Interesting. So Japan is getting an actual tangible release of that.
6596000	6597000	So that is coming out this week.
6597000	6602000	Also coming out this week in Japan, MLB The Show 20 is also getting its Japanese release this week.
6602000	6604000	So those are the big releases in Japan.
6604000	6608000	How about Europe? Dark Sakura is not here, but perhaps you can fill in.
6608000	6611000	Well, Europe is pretty similar to what we've got over here.
6611000	6617000	So we've got Remnant coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6617000	6623000	We've got TT Isle of Man right on the edge 2.
6623000	6626000	That's on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6626000	6634000	Then of course the Nintendo Switch Animal Crossing system and Animal Crossing the game itself on the Switch.
6634000	6638000	And Doom Eternal coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
6638000	6639000	And that's it.
6639000	6642000	So Doom Eternal not releasing in Japan.
6642000	6644000	I noticed that was not on the list of Japanese releases.
6644000	6651000	So the reality is it's an Animal Crossing world and y'all just living in it this week.
6651000	6653000	No, it'll be fun. I'm excited for it.
6653000	6657000	All right. Moving on. Let's get into some more news.
6657000	6660000	And later in the show, we will be taking your Discord calls.
6660000	6666000	If anybody wants to give us a call on Discord, we will be available in the green room over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
6666000	6669000	Or if you have any questions for us in chat, we will...
6669000	6671000	Don't say them now because I'll miss them. They'll scroll off the screen.
6671000	6675000	But a little later in the show, we'll open it up to any random questions you might have in chat.
6675000	6679000	Again, there were no emails tonight, but you can feel free to send us an email for a future week.
6679000	6682000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6682000	6686000	I'm laughing at what AkumaJP said in our chat room over at Twitch.tv slash vognetwork.
6686000	6691000	I know I will never buy Animal Crossing. I am wise enough not to get drugs.
6691000	6699000	All right. Moving on. Let's get into some more stories.
6699000	6702000	This is a pretty big one that may have been under the radar this week.
6703000	6716000	GameStop's been going through quite a bit of changes recently, trying to find its identity and trying to figure out how to survive in this ever more increasingly digital gaming world.
6716000	6723000	With that, it also comes change to some of their corporate boards and stuff.
6723000	6733000	For example, Reggie Fils-Aime has now joined the GameStop Corporation board as one of its members to help guide that company.
6733000	6742000	Hopefully, with his guidance, they'll be able to figure out what to do.
6742000	6747000	I know, locally, we've got a couple locations that are closing. One right by my house.
6747000	6750000	I'm hitting them up for all the discount stuff.
6750000	6752000	I got a discount shirt from there.
6752000	6756000	Show the Twitch people the shirt you got there.
6756000	6761000	A brand new Pikachu shirt. It's kind of hard to see on the camera.
6761000	6767000	It says Pikachu, I believe, in Japanese in number 25.
6767000	6770000	That's his dex number, yeah.
6771000	6780000	They were doing a buy one get one free sale on their shirts already, and then they had discounts as well.
6780000	6785000	I got two shirts for eight bucks, so I can't pass up on cheap shirts.
6785000	6787000	I'm probably going to go back.
6787000	6797000	And as part of that, because it's kind of hard to miss the giant wall banner of Animal Crossing New Leaf.
6798000	6801000	Guys, what are you going to do with that?
6801000	6803000	Are you saying we might get some more decorations?
6803000	6805000	I'm saying we might get some more decorations.
6805000	6808000	I'm sad to hear that.
6808000	6811000	It is sad they're going to be closing at the end of the month.
6811000	6817000	As much crap as I give GameStop sometimes, that was one of the locations I really didn't mind.
6817000	6820000	They all had great workers there, and it was a huge location.
6820000	6825000	It's a decent-sized location, and the workers are nice.
6825000	6828000	And speaking of how nice they are, I was speaking to them like,
6828000	6834000	I was like, yeah, it'd be cool if I could get that when you guys are closing.
6834000	6843000	We do this podcast for almost 18 years now, and we would love some new wall art or something.
6843000	6847000	And then he's like, hey, come here, let me show you the back room real quick.
6847000	6853000	So he shows me the back room, and just all over the walls, just giant posters of all these things.
6853000	6854000	Cool.
6854000	6858000	Like Tron evolution, he's like, come back here right about when we're going to close, and he's all, I'll hook you up.
6858000	6860000	That's very nice of them to do.
6860000	6863000	Dark Soccer on Chat says, I feel bad for the employees getting fucked over.
6863000	6866000	Hopefully, fingers and toes crossed, those folks are getting redistributed.
6866000	6871000	He was saying, the one guy that was there is saying that he doesn't know where he's going to go yet,
6871000	6874000	and he's not sure if they're going to be able to relocate him to another store.
6875000	6881000	Because I think he's a manager, so he's like, I'm not sure where I'm going to be able, if they're going to be able to relocate me,
6881000	6883000	but everyone else might be able to, but I don't know.
6883000	6887000	Well, fingers and toes crossed, especially since those guys have been so cool to you.
6887000	6892000	Yeah, so we'll see. I'm going to make a few more stops there, get more t-shirts.
6892000	6900000	And I'm hoping, I mean, they're pretty picked through already, but they're discounting stuff every Thursday until they finally close.
6900000	6904000	I'm hoping that maybe they have some more Joy-Cons, because ours suck ass,
6904000	6909000	and I forgot to send mine in originally when I requested the A.R.S. label.
6910000	6912000	Well, back to the Reggie fees and everything.
6912000	6913000	Yeah, yeah.
6913000	6915000	So, what do you think this is going to mean for GameStop?
6915000	6917000	Because some people are saying, yay, Reggie's going to save GameStop.
6917000	6921000	And I'm kind of like, well, he's not running it. He's not CEO.
6921000	6923000	It's not just him that was added to the board, too.
6923000	6925000	So, he's not the only one.
6925000	6928000	So, they've had kind of a refresh of leadership there.
6928000	6934000	So, they also added Bill Simon and JK, I cannot pronounce the dude's last name.
6934000	6943000	I guess Bill Simon, he has experience in retail and food industries, and he was the president and CEO of Walmart in the early 2010s.
6943000	6950000	And then the other dude, JK Simmon, I can't pronounce his fucking last name.
6950000	6953000	Too many goddamn syllables or consonants in there.
6953000	6957000	He is the current president and CEO of PetSmart.
6958000	6959000	Oh, interesting.
6959000	6960000	So...
6960000	6964000	Well, let's not forget Reggie had retail experience as well. Before he was at Nintendo, he was at Panda Express.
6964000	6966000	So, you know, and those...
6966000	6969000	I mean, they need to change what they're doing.
6969000	6984000	And I know, like, we saw, like, I've seen some stuff that GamerTech Radio has been, like, posting up about, like, they got tours of, like, some of these, like, concept stores.
6985000	6988000	So, they have, like, a GameStop retro store.
6988000	6992000	Oh, I've heard of the one that's, like, an e-sports...
6992000	6998000	Yeah, they have, like, an e-sports place. Like, they have one of those, like, an e-sports lounge type store.
6998000	7002000	And then they also have, like, a retro focus store as well, like, with...
7002000	7006000	Funny enough, it reminds me of a...
7006000	7009000	And I'm not sure how successful or even if they're around.
7009000	7011000	I know they're still around a few stores.
7011000	7017000	But it reminds me of a startup company that was trying to take over or trying to take on GameStop called Play & Trade.
7017000	7020000	They did a lot of these, you know, like, try before you buy type things.
7020000	7024000	So, they had kiosks where you could try all the games out and stuff like that.
7024000	7026000	But now it seems like they're going that route almost.
7026000	7032000	And because people are buying, like, online a lot of times, they need a place to try some of these games.
7032000	7035000	I don't understand how the e-sports lounge thing is going to work out.
7035000	7038000	I know, like, even one of the local Walmarts tries that.
7038000	7040000	This is a bad time.
7040000	7043000	It's just, it's like, I just don't, I don't understand.
7043000	7045000	I mean, I get it, e-sports is popular.
7045000	7050000	But I just don't see myself, like, saying, I need to go down to GameStop to go play e-sports games.
7050000	7053000	Like, I don't know.
7053000	7055000	Good luck!
7055000	7057000	Alright.
7057000	7059000	Well, moving on, let's talk about Phantasy Star Online 2.
7059000	7061000	Another great game to look forward to.
7061000	7064000	It's not being released per se, but the open beta starts this week.
7064000	7065000	Oh, cool.
7065000	7070000	So, and I think, correct me if I'm wrong, guys, I think that's on PC as well as Xbox.
7070000	7073000	So, that'll be really cool. I can't wait to check that out.
7073000	7078000	But if you want to support Phantasy Star Online 2, of course they're going to sell things to you.
7078000	7080000	Like cosmetics and things like that.
7080000	7087000	In fact, Sega is going to be adding a $59.99, and Mr. Smoosh is really excited about this,
7087000	7092000	a $59.99 Founders Pack to the North American version of the game.
7092000	7096000	It's called a Phantasy Star Online 2 Sonic Collaboration Edition.
7096000	7100000	Now, even though Phantasy Star Online 2 is going to be free to play,
7100000	7102000	there will be, you know, stuff that they're going to sell.
7102000	7108000	So, this $59 pack is going to have Sonic the Hedgehog themed things,
7108000	7113000	a Sonic and Tails emote for a user, a Knuckles themed weapon camo.
7113000	7114000	So, here's everything you get.
7114000	7118000	One Beauty Salon free pass, one Mission Pass gold ticket,
7118000	7121000	one Premium Set, which is a 30-day subscription,
7121000	7124000	five Character Storage Expansions, that's 50 items,
7124000	7127000	five Inventory Expansions, 10 items,
7127000	7129000	five Raggle Memories, I don't know what that is,
7129000	7135000	10 Tri-Boost, 12 AC Scratch Tickets, 99 Grade Enhancement Aids, and 500 Grinders.
7135000	7138000	So, and that's not to be confused with the popular phone app.
7138000	7143000	Grinders are what level up your weapons and things like that to like plus one, plus two, and so forth.
7143000	7146000	So, yeah, and they have a whole little thing showing that off.
7146000	7149000	60 bucks is kind of asking a lot, but I mean,
7149000	7155000	I'm willing to drop 60 bucks on Phantasy Star Online because I'll be playing it.
7155000	7160000	I don't know if I'd do that during the open beta, but I'll, I don't know,
7160000	7163000	I'd drop it maybe if it was finished.
7163000	7170000	Now, Dark Soccer in Chat says, I only see X-Bone over at PSO2.com slash play.
7170000	7175000	I think it is supposed to, the open beta, again, open beta isn't for a few more days.
7175000	7179000	So they may not put out that client till Monday or Tuesday, but I believe open beta is supposed to be PC.
7179000	7181000	So keep your eye out on that.
7181000	7189000	So, but when the game releases in full, it will definitely be for both Windows and Xbox.
7189000	7194000	Sorry, Jamie, I know you're a Mac fan, but since Microsoft helped bring this out here,
7194000	7196000	I wouldn't expect a Mac native version.
7196000	7198000	They're going to make you use Windows for it for that.
7198000	7201000	So, all right.
7201000	7205000	Well, let's move on. A few more stories. Loki.
7205000	7210000	All right. So as we've talked a lot about the whole COVID-19 stuff,
7210000	7216000	there is still a lot of different events that are kind of up in the air right now.
7216000	7222000	So one of those being, you know, a lot of these different fighting games tournaments that have been kind of postponed.
7222000	7230000	So, for example, the SNK World Championship for Samurai Showdown and King of Fighters looks like 14.
7230000	7234000	That's been postponed indefinitely.
7234000	7242000	And then there was also a Tekken 7 exhibition that was scaled down as well.
7242000	7249000	Final Combat looks like has been canceled.
7249000	7256000	And then, of course, I guess Street Fighter 5 Capcom or Capcom has been pulled.
7256000	7261000	I guess several of the stops for the Capcom Pro Tour.
7261000	7265000	So that kind of sucks. But I mean, understandable.
7265000	7270000	Well, and I kind of brought that up earlier, how like, you know, tournament video game tournaments, if there's more than 50 people.
7270000	7276000	Right. Yeah. Especially like with like even in California, like right now, there's a state of emergency.
7276000	7280000	So like today, they said, you know, all clubs and bars are closed.
7280000	7284000	You know, and then, of course, they were saying, you know, any gatherings larger than 50, you know.
7284000	7287000	So eventually restaurants could follow as well.
7287000	7290000	I mean, who knows? Lots of these different gatherings.
7290000	7296000	And so I know in our work, it's any non-essential meetings, no travel, you know, that type of stuff.
7296000	7303000	Yeah. Same to everything for your WebEx, which is made for some very entertaining meetings because people don't know how to use fucking WebEx.
7303000	7307000	But good times.
7307000	7323000	Yeah. Well, hopefully, you know, this in a couple of months, you know, we've squashed COVID to more reasonable levels where we don't have to have the same type of restrictions that we have now.
7323000	7328000	And we can get back to having these types of tournaments and people will really miss them.
7328000	7332000	Kind of like one of those absence makes the heart grow fonder type of things.
7332000	7337000	I just hope the economic damage hasn't been done so bad that people don't want to go.
7337000	7345000	We'll see. Anyhow, moving on to a little bit of a lighter story here at the end, because, you know, we love our music game news, right?
7345000	7349000	Sure. So I actually have a Dance Dance Revolution story here at the end of the show.
7349000	7352000	And it has to do. Oh, I forgot to mention.
7352000	7355000	Sorry. Sorry. I played DDR this week.
7355000	7359000	I haven't played DDR in a long time because I don't know.
7359000	7363000	Lazy. But I I did play DDR.
7363000	7368000	You do know, actually. Yes.
7368000	7371000	But so you play some DDR, play DDR arcade.
7371000	7374000	It was fun. I am very much out of shape now.
7374000	7377000	All of the shape that I got into. It's gone.
7377000	7380000	But but did you play DDR with Dua Lipa?
7380000	7382000	And I hope I said her name right. Did you play?
7382000	7387000	Did you play? I have no idea who that person is. I know she has some songs because they've come up on Spotify.
7387000	7391000	And the one song of hers I know is the baby.
7391000	7396000	Dana, Dana, shut up, because I don't give a fuck like that's her.
7396000	7401000	She has that song about not giving a fuck, which, you know, hashtag mood.
7401000	7406000	Right. And she has some satisfaction. I think is another one of her songs that she's did.
7406000	7409000	So, God, I'm showing my age here a little bit, aren't I? Somebody in chat, help me out.
7409000	7414000	Make me look cool. But anyway, Dua Lipa is actually going on tour in Europe.
7414000	7418000	And the album is Future Nostalgia that she's going to be promoting.
7418000	7421000	And you can buy a VIP package called Dua's House Party.
7421000	7425000	And, you know, you get early access to the venue, merchandise.
7425000	7434000	And you can enter a competition for a chance with a live dance off with Dua on Dance Dance Revolution.
7434000	7437000	So apparently she's a fan. Again, I'm so sorry if I'm mispronouncing the name.
7437000	7441000	But I've only heard the songs pop up on Spotify here and there. I've never heard her name said.
7441000	7446000	So, I mean, who knows if this shit's going to happen anymore in the current state of the world.
7446000	7451000	But I imagine if they're talking about selling concert tickets that this is probably something that's actually more in the fall.
7451000	7455000	It's probably not happening like next week. So, yeah.
7455000	7459000	VIP packages for Madrid and Barcelona already sold out.
7459000	7464000	But Amsterdam is still an option if you want to spend about 200 and, excuse me, 310 euros for it.
7464000	7468000	So, I mean, if I knew who that was, I mean, that'd be pretty cool.
7468000	7472000	Yeah, I didn't. She has her song. New Rules is in DDR.
7472000	7476000	I guess the 20. Oh, I didn't even know that. OK, so.
7476000	7479000	OK, because I was like, well, that's like a random thing. But OK, so.
7479000	7482000	So in a 20, she actually has a song in it. That's pretty cool.
7482000	7491000	They need to hurry up and get that round one open here, although I guess that won't be happening for a couple of months now, will it?
7491000	7501000	All right. Anyway, let's move on and invite you guys to keep your social distance from us and participate with us virtually via Discord.
7501000	7506000	Or if you have a question for us in our chat room, we will take it there, too, over at vognetwork.com.
7506000	7511000	Excuse me. I was. Excuse me. Over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.
7511000	7516000	We've only been gone three weeks. Why am I saying the old name of the site we haven't been on?
7516000	7519000	Well, I mean, technically, you could still go to vognetwork.com. There's lots of great stuff there.
7519000	7526000	But I keep wanting to go live dot vognetwork dot com, which I think Bobby has actually built that if you do go there, you kind of get forwarded to the Twitch.
7526000	7533000	It's not like I'm giving you bad advice, but it's actually not the right place you're supposed to be anyway.
7533000	7537000	All right. So if you want to join us, you can join our green room and we'll get some of those calls.
7537000	7542000	But do we have any last minute stories or other things that we haven't talked about yet?
7543000	7553000	Um, no, I thought this is kind of interesting, but apparently it says without any actual NBA or English Premier League.
7553000	7562000	What's going to happen is they're doing like kind of some simulcast games in NBA 2K20 instead.
7562000	7566000	They're going to broadcast it on Twitch. So it's like.
7566000	7571000	You know, instead of these teams actually playing, it's just, OK, we'll have the AI play or they're going to play.
7571000	7572000	I don't know.
7572000	7576000	Dr. Suya in our vog chat says, oh, I'm sorry.
7576000	7581000	I was going to say in the Premier League, of course, that's with football managers.
7581000	7584000	Dr. Suya in our Twitch chat says, how about a comment?
7584000	7587000	We noticed La Mulana Hidden Treasures was absent from release dates.
7587000	7591000	Oops. The wife has our copy preordered. It should be in this week.
7591000	7597000	So I know Dr. Suya is a big fan of La Mulana, so I hope to see some YouTube or some, you know, some some exciting clips from the game.
7597000	7601000	Well, that's because I don't necessarily. That's a probably digital release game.
7601000	7607000	Digital releases don't always show up. Well, I thought they were doing a physical release.
7607000	7611000	Well, yeah, because Dr. Suya says the wife has our copy preordered.
7611000	7615000	It should be in this week. So they must have some kind of like limited physical release.
7615000	7620000	Let's take a look at a fuller release here.
7620000	7628000	La Mulana, La Mulana. Here we go. La Mulana one and two on Tuesday, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch.
7628000	7631000	And lots of games coming out. Yeah. Golf Extreme on PC. All right.
7631000	7636000	We do have a call waiting to get in. So let's get to it. Hi. You are on orange on radio. Who's this?
7636000	7640000	Hey, what's going on, everybody? It's Ron. Hey, Ron. It's good to hear from you.
7640000	7644000	Sorry, you're really low on our end here. So let me just make sure we can hear you in studio.
7644000	7648000	What's on your mind tonight? Not much. I apologize for the lowness.
7648000	7652000	I just got a new mixer, so I'm kind of breaking it in, quote unquote.
7652000	7657000	No, your your your levels are fine. It's just our TV volume is up and down.
7657000	7663000	But no worries. What's on your mind tonight? I want to go back to the beginning.
7663000	7671000	We talked about these cancelations of events. I'm really not as angry as I was,
7671000	7677000	but I'm more annoyed at people at a whole because I don't know if you've noticed,
7677000	7683000	but since a lot of cases have been popping up over covid-19, that's what I'm calling it,
7683000	7689000	because that's the proper name. There have been various comic cons and anime cons and gaming conventions that's being canceled.
7689000	7694000	And I'm just following it. And I'm like, OK, all right. For us to anime jam session,
7694000	7698000	the kickoff of our convention season is Zenkai Con in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
7698000	7705000	We're following it. And Friday they made the announcement because of Lancaster basically shutting down.
7705000	7712000	The convention will be canceled till next year. And I get it. I understand being upset about this.
7712000	7717000	I had a really nice formal cosplay. I was going to work with my lady.
7717000	7723000	I had something special to give her. But you know what? I have alternate plans for that.
7723000	7732000	But what got to me is. The selfishness of people who are demanding that they continue with the convention anyway,
7732000	7736000	they still want to do this. They're like, I have spent so much money on my cosplays.
7736000	7740000	I spent so much money on my hotel room. You better have the convention.
7740000	7746000	And I'm just sitting here like, do you not understand the health risks that are at stake here?
7746000	7749000	Do you not understand this? Do you not see what's going on here?
7749000	7756000	I got into a pissing contest with somebody whose health immuno system is bad.
7756000	7760000	She basically said she wanted the convention to happen and she didn't care.
7760000	7766000	She didn't care. She caught it and she didn't care. She died as long as she was able to go to the convention.
7766000	7771000	And I'm just like, between politics and other things,
7771000	7779000	this COVID-19 is really bringing out the worst in a lot of people and they need to calm the F down.
7779000	7786000	Yeah. You know, I, I, I would hope that she didn't really mean those things and we don't know what she might be dealing with.
7786000	7793000	I mean, like you said, if she has a weakened immune system or what have you, she's probably dealing with a lot of other things that are kind of going on behind the scenes.
7793000	7797000	So, you know, just trying to like put myself in her shoes a little bit.
7797000	7799000	She's probably trying to deal with the weight of the situation.
7799000	7807000	And it's probably like, like I think this all kind of goes back to the point that like people's mental health are not going to be in a great place because of this whole thing.
7807000	7812000	And it's okay to check in on people and see how they're doing and, you know, check in on your friends,
7812000	7821000	make sure they're doing well because there's going to be a lot of people that are really challenged with things going through this that they might not like usually deal with.
7821000	7823000	So I'm not excusing her behavior.
7823000	7827000	I'm just trying to like say like, this is probably why it's happening.
7827000	7830000	But at the end of the day, she probably doesn't really mean it.
7830000	7834000	You know, not again, not excusing it or saying, oh, that makes it okay or what have you.
7834000	7843000	Obviously, it's a very ridiculous look because I know a convention getting canceled is an inconvenience, especially when you have all that flight and stuff.
7843000	7849000	But do you know what's really inconvenient is Grandma dying because you gave her a lung disease.
7849000	7851000	That's fucking inconvenient.
7851000	7857000	So like and I don't mean I'm sorry to be so crass or blunt and I'm sorry if what I just said like is triggering in any way.
7857000	7866000	But that's the reality, I think, of these situations and why people are saying, you know, take it seriously when we talk about social distancing and so forth.
7866000	7875000	Like, you know, like we said earlier in the show, like if you want to go to a restaurant and have a burger and hang with a couple people that, you know, we're all washing our hands, taking care of themselves.
7875000	7876000	That's one thing.
7876000	7886000	But I know y'all saw those Twitter videos of people at St. Patrick's Day at the bar packed in there waiting to get inside because the bar is too full inside.
7886000	7894000	Like, hello, that's a problem right now. Like you don't, you know, Loki and I sitting here doing this is one thing.
7894000	7903000	St. Patrick's Day or as I sometimes call it Heterosexual Pride Day is a whole nother issue right now in the state of the world.
7903000	7915000	So unfortunately, because people couldn't police themselves, this is why now the government is coming in and saying, you know what, we just need to close the bars because people are going to be, you know, crass about it and not able to take care of themselves.
7915000	7922000	Now they're going to take all the alcohol out of the stores because, you know, they've already bottled the toilet paper and pasta.
7923000	7930000	It's Flee in Chat says, I know I've really had to limit my Twitter use because it's giving me a lot of anxiety.
7930000	7941000	Between us, like, same. Like, I'm, there's just, I can't look at all that shit on Twitter. Like, it's just too much doom and gloom.
7941000	7951000	Too much you're wrong, I'm right. Too much you're not reading this and like, you know, in my opinion, when are they going to shut Facebook down for eight weeks?
7951000	7955000	So the misinformation shit, you know what, you know what I saw on Facebook today?
7955000	7963000	You know what I saw on Facebook? That if you gargle with saltwater, it will kill the virus that lives in your neck or your throat for four days.
7963000	7969000	I tried to post an article about, you know, the Snopes, like fact checking, like, no, that isn't true. And the CDC says it's not true.
7969000	7972000	And somebody replied trying to insinuate that I was wrong.
7973000	7978000	Rob, here's one for you. Someone come, this is through a friend of mine who's been following this.
7978000	7985000	She told me when she was explaining this, somebody said, it's not that big of a deal, it's just a cough.
7985000	7994000	As somebody who lived with someone with a weak immune system, I probably would have gone through the intertubes and choked this person, okay?
7995000	8007000	It's unfortunately very selfish. But unfortunately, and this is a very difficult thing to say, some people are only going to learn the hard way.
8007000	8013000	You know what, and I've been saying that. And to go back to what you're saying, you're probably right. We don't know what this girl is going through.
8013000	8022000	But after 10 of us explain to her, her views and what it means and educate, she's still going on.
8022000	8029000	So I was just like, you know what, I can't take this anymore. I would say she's like an exception to what's going on.
8029000	8034000	But there are a lot of people who are upset that these events aren't happening.
8034000	8040000	Heck, there is a group of cosplayers that are trying to have a get together in Lancaster for this weekend.
8040000	8044000	They're calling it SpeakeasyCon. And I'm sitting here watching this event.
8044000	8051000	I'm just like, at first, me and Mako, we were going to actually go out to Lancaster and chill and do the touristy thing.
8051000	8057000	If this is actually happening, we staying at home. That's it. Nope.
8057000	8070000	You know what, for what it's worth, some of my best nights on the cruise, we skipped the dance party and just found like a little corner in a bar and just hung out like a small group of us and had a really great time.
8070000	8078000	Sometimes it's not about where you're at, but it's about who you're with, you know, and again, you got to take your precautions in this day and age with your small group hangouts.
8078000	8087000	But, you know, you know, I, you know, I might just go as far as because I do have some staffers at Billy, I might reach out and be like, if you're not doing anything, let's hang out and day trip.
8087000	8092000	Five of us hanging out. Cool. I'm perfectly okay with that. Yeah.
8092000	8095000	One other thing I'll leave. Oh, sorry, go ahead.
8095000	8097000	No, no, no, no, no, go on, go on.
8098000	8111000	I was gonna say one other thing I would really encourage, you know, people to do out of this, you know, time and, you know, people like Flea and other people who are dealing with the anxiety of like social media and just everybody talking about the sky is falling and all that stuff.
8111000	8120000	And to some extent, yes, the sky is falling, but it doesn't like have to, you don't just have to sit there and watch it fall and let it worry you and so forth.
8120000	8142000	And my point is you can kind of channel some of that energy into different types of creative projects. Like if you have ever thought like, now's the time I want to get into streaming, or I want to make a YouTube channel, or I want to start a podcast, or you know what, I was going to write this novel in not what was not no Remo in November, I was going to write my novel November.
8142000	8152000	Well, guess what, everything else got pushed back, not now Remo got pushed up because with everybody else, you know, on quarantine right now, now is the time to write that novel.
8152000	8163000	If that's something that you've always wanted to do, like, you know, try to take this crap situation and maybe do something you've always wanted.
8163000	8168000	Are you saying I should finish my game? Because that's not going to happen right now.
8168000	8174000	Well, Loki, I don't have to say it.
8174000	8186000	Because I still have to work. Unfortunately, I have to work remotely if, you know, everything goes down and, and unfortunately, even though like, we're not supposed to go outside and do things.
8186000	8193000	I'll have to go outside and do things because other folks are not going to go outside and do things.
8194000	8211000	Loki, I envy you, because for the last couple of days, we've been hearing, take your laptops home. Oh, there's absolutely no need. My work laptop is sitting in my bag, and I'm waiting for that email saying you're working from home, because where I work is some of you know where I do work.
8211000	8226000	There are certain floors that look like abandoned ghost towns, I feel like different floor I walk in, I hear some ominous music playing, and somebody will come up behind me, and I'm glad they hit them with a box or something. Okay.
8226000	8234000	Well, hopefully enough people, you know, to balance out the people like the other person you brought up that just is not taking this seriously, which is really unfortunate.
8234000	8241000	Hopefully there will be enough people that do take it seriously where we can, you know, as they're talking about flattening the curve and although it's something that's going to make it kind of last a little longer.
8241000	8258000	It'll impact less people and it'll keep, you know, er is hopefully not so bad and so forth. So I really, yeah, and, you know, it's, it's difficult with all the talk about the economy but that is where we're going to need the government to step in and help out.
8258000	8274000	You know, and I'm, I'm not going to make it a political thing. Y'all can read between the lines, y'all have your own feeling on that. I'm just saying the government needs to figure out how to reassure people financially it's going to be okay.
8274000	8288000	And for all this talk about red team and blue team and so forth like I don't give a fuck. You, you, you people are fucking paid to figure it out. So, you get there and you fucking figure it out, like, yeah.
8288000	8297000	The thing that makes me most angry right now is that one of our branches of government is on fucking vacation, like, it's time to come back, you get a horse in a fucking carriage and get back if you have to.
8297000	8314000	Agreed. I mean, during my gaming date tonight, we had a bit of downtime not overheard you say something about how the government is screwing the pooch on this. I stood up and I just started clapping I'm like, brother Rob is preaching right now because if that's not the gods honest, I don't know what is.
8314000	8321000	And if they cannot do their jobs, then you know what happens to people that don't do their jobs, they are fired.
8321000	8331000	So if I have a certain somebody can't do his fucking job, then to borrow a popular catchphrase, you're fired.
8331000	8334000	I second that motion, let it carry.
8335000	8346000	Yeah, but it's more rules for the not for me. So, you know, yeah. Anyway. All right. So, sorry, we got a little so boxy, but, you know, people, people.
8346000	8361000	Bro, it's not soapbox and we have the preaching and it's the truth. Everybody in the chat room right now, agrees with everyone we're talking over here is nobody say, actually, no, you say that, sit down, open your ears and listen.
8361000	8370000	Yeah, okay. So I was gonna mention, you know, since we were talking about a lot of Mulana and stuff and other games we may have mentioned, forgot to mention that may have been digital releases.
8370000	8379000	One was brought to my attention on the list because of the name. And I said, What the hell is this, I need to take a look at this. And it is a game called Pooplers.
8380000	8393000	Pooplers is a multiplayer game where up to four players take control over babies. Toddlers do not belong to the calm ones. As soon as nobody's watching them, they crawl around the house, pooping.
8393000	8406000	A humorous game, however, has a number of elements that diversify the gameplay. Basically, it's like Splatoon, except you're a baby that crawls around the house pooping.
8406000	8416000	And you're trying to spread your poop color all over the house as much as you can without getting caught by the adults. Coming out on Steam this week, go pick it up.
8416000	8423000	And on that note, I'm going to hang up. Maybe COVID should kill us all.
8423000	8433000	On that note, gentlemen, I'm going to hang up, listen to the rest of the show and play some Hyrule Warriors. Good night, gentlemen. Good night, sir.
8437000	8440000	That's going to do it for Discord calls tonight.
8441000	8449000	I have some other last minute stories. DarkSakura was like, Ooh, talk about this. Ooh, talk about this. So I do have a couple things to talk about.
8449000	8458000	Did you hear about this one is that there was a Japanese school that was going to be having a graduation ceremony, but it got canceled because of all the quarantine going on.
8458000	8465000	So now they're going to have it in Minecraft. That's cool. So they're having a virtual graduation ceremony in Minecraft.
8465000	8474000	And I bet you start to see more virtual spaces get used for maybe not like graduations, but, you know, obviously like Zoom and WebEx and stuff is being used for meetings.
8474000	8485000	But I wouldn't I wouldn't doubt that some conventions are going to end up taking place in Final Fantasy 14 or in, you know, like virtual type of spaces, you know, VR chat or things like that.
8485000	8496000	It's going to be very interesting. So anyway, I lost all the other stories. Shoot. Oh, yes. Here's the other one that she sent along.
8497000	8503000	Oh, oh, oh, I'm actually really glad DarkSakura brought this up because, yes, this came up on our Discord server as well.
8503000	8511000	Nvidia was put out a tweet that was asking gaming PC owners to put their systems to work in fighting COVID-19.
8511000	8516000	And this is all through an organization called Folding at Home, which is tied to Stanford.
8516000	8521000	So you guys may or may not remember, Folding at Home was a thing on the PlayStation 3 for a long time.
8521000	8526000	And it went away as a lot of like Sony stuff did, because, you know, most of the PlayStation 3 stuff.
8526000	8533000	But Folding at Home is still there. So essentially, it's distributed computing and really oversimplifying the science of it.
8533000	8542000	It's basically you're helping to fold proteins and run experiments and things like that about different, you know, viruses and sicknesses.
8542000	8549000	So historically, it's been for things like Alzheimer's and things where you don't have a cure yet, but now they've prioritized this COVID stuff.
8549000	8555000	So if you want to look into this, you can go to foldingathome.org, I think it is.
8555000	8559000	And obviously, you can't use the at sign in the URL, so you spell it out.
8559000	8564000	And you can actually check out the application for yourself. I downloaded it and I've been trying to run it.
8564000	8571000	I will caution you with this, though, and I've been seeing some feedback on Discord and all this stuff is that since it is using your idle processes
8571000	8578000	and it's using your idle processes on your CPU and your GPU, it may cause your system to run hot pretty continuously.
8578000	8585000	It may cause your fan to spin up a lot as well. So it may not be a program for you.
8585000	8591000	You may need to go in there into the advanced settings and tweak it a little bit so you tell it not to use as much power
8591000	8595000	and maybe it will get the job done as fast, but it'll still get the job done.
8595000	8603000	So you got to find what works for you, but it may not be for every setup.
8603000	8606000	And that's, you know, and that's okay. It's not going to be for every setup.
8606000	8610000	But I want to put that out. If you think that's interesting, that's something you want to help with.
8610000	8616000	Again, it's way oversimplifying it to say you're going to help find a cure for COVID,
8616000	8623000	but you're going to help with some of the research that gets there eventually.
8623000	8629000	You know, so I think it's a really cool little thing and it's one of those things, you know, especially with all the gaming PCs people have and stuff,
8629000	8633000	you know, it's a way we can help, you know, we're going to put stuff to good use.
8633000	8636000	But again, it may not be for your computer specifically.
8636000	8640000	I know I've been having a lot of problems, like my computer is crashing and it's doing all this weird shit.
8640000	8645000	So I don't know if it's, I wish they would put out the PlayStation app again.
8645000	8648000	That's what I would really love to see, you know, on the PS4 or something.
8648000	8655000	Yeah, it would be cool. My PC is crashing anytime I hook it to external monitors sometimes.
8655000	8658000	And I've tried several things to fix it.
8658000	8662000	And then today while I was sitting here, and I don't know if it was because I had my pizza box sitting here,
8662000	8667000	but I saw a blue screen as well, and I'm wondering if it's still related to the graphics driver.
8667000	8671000	I need to probably just reinstall Windows. I just don't want to.
8671000	8676000	And Flea says, do be aware, it's going to increase your electric bill.
8676000	8681000	Even if you're on modest settings, it can increase your electric bill like $50.
8681000	8685000	So, you know, be aware of that stuff.
8685000	8689000	But, you know, maybe some people will be willing to pay that to kind of know that they're helping in some sort of way.
8689000	8692000	So I just want to put it, I'm not saying you have to do this or you need to do this,
8692000	8698000	but I just want to put that out there as this is a way you might be able to help if you think it's something you can help with.
8698000	8700000	So just throwing it out there, that's all.
8700000	8703000	So, but thank you, Jamie, for sending that along.
8703000	8705000	I think she left chat, so she didn't hear me bring it up.
8705000	8707000	But hopefully, oh, no, she just texted me.
8707000	8710000	Is this, oh, sorry, I had to leave abruptly. That's OK.
8710000	8712000	Well, I talked about your stories, Jamie.
8712000	8714000	All right. That was a good one.
8714000	8715000	Anything else you want to bring up, Loki?
8715000	8717000	No, that's it. That's all I have.
8717000	8721000	Well, I think I think that we're about to the end of the show where we're here to wrap things up.
8721000	8725000	So I want to thank you guys for coming back to OLR tonight.
8725000	8729000	I know we've been gone for a few weeks, so I'm really thankful you guys came back with us,
8729000	8733000	whether it was here live on a Sunday night or whether it was during the podcast feed.
8733000	8735000	I know it's been a heavy week in the real world.
8735000	8737000	I'm sorry a lot of that came to the show.
8737000	8740000	But, you know, as you heard in the opening minutes there, we didn't have a choice.
8740000	8744000	This type of stuff might be on our doorstep right now.
8744000	8748000	So, you know, we're taking precautions, washing our hands, using sanitizer,
8748000	8753000	making sure we don't cough on people, just trying to stay away from big gatherings for a little bit.
8753000	8755000	And together we'll get through this.
8755000	8758000	Now's a better time than ever to play something like Death Stranding,
8758000	8762000	which that game seems so remarkably timed here in retrospect.
8762000	8765000	I don't think Jamie and I really talked about that enough at the beginning of the show,
8765000	8771000	but the themes in that game are so like, you know, it's obviously there's supernatural elements
8771000	8775000	and things to it that don't really work, but, you know, some of it is really,
8775000	8780000	I would love to hear Kojima talk about that game now in light of what's going on everywhere.
8780000	8781000	I forgot.
8781000	8782000	What was that?
8782000	8786000	Hopefully it's still on, like, I got a notification the other day
8786000	8793000	because I have Earth Defense Force Iron Rain in my wish list that it was on sale.
8793000	8794000	I think I missed the sale.
8794000	8796000	Oh, thank you. Bobby Black Wolf is reminding me.
8796000	8798000	We didn't even talk about this before the show, but I forgot.
8798000	8799000	But he talked about it on his show.
8799000	8804000	But did you hear the thing about Horizon Zero Dawn is going to be coming to PC
8804000	8807000	and certain PlayStation fanboys are losing their fucking mind.
8807000	8808000	Why?
8808000	8812000	Because Sony's done four because of exclusives.
8812000	8816000	Oh, whatever. What about all those other games that came to the Unreal Store?
8816000	8817000	That game was out like four years ago.
8817000	8818000	Epic Store, yeah.
8818000	8821000	Let more people play games. It's not that big a deal.
8821000	8823000	Oh, I did not miss it. Yes.
8823000	8828000	Besides, a lot of things in this day and age are timed exclusives and that's a big thing.
8828000	8833000	So, yes, Horizon Zero Dawn is not going to kill the PlayStation 5 because you know what?
8833000	8835000	There will be a Horizon Zero Dawn 2.
8835000	8836000	That game was big enough.
8836000	8838000	And think of it this way, you guys.
8838000	8844000	The Sony folks that are thinking like that and sending those weird tweets and stuff, think of it this way.
8844000	8850000	If you get more people exposed to your franchise via a PC release,
8850000	8855000	then when Sony inevitably announces Horizon Zero Dawn Part 2, or whatever it's called,
8855000	8857000	for the PlayStation 5, that's more people.
8857000	8860000	They're going to be like, oh, yeah, I was playing that recently on PC.
8860000	8865000	Ooh, maybe I should get a PlayStation versus an Xbox because I really like that game and I want to play the sequel.
8865000	8870000	So, it might actually be a good thing, so calm down.
8870000	8871000	It's going to be fine.
8871000	8873000	So, anyway.
8873000	8878000	Well, I made that mistake or I fixed that mistake.
8878000	8879000	How so?
8879000	8881000	I purchased Earth Defense Force Iron Rain.
8881000	8883000	Oh, there you go. Good.
8883000	8885000	All right. Final thoughts.
8885000	8889000	Thank you guys again for listening to our show and joining us and being with us tonight.
8889000	8892000	I know it's been a crazy week, but I meant what I said.
8892000	8893000	Support your artists.
8893000	8895000	Be there for your friends.
8895000	8899000	If you are in a financially comfortable place right now, even amongst all this,
8899000	8903000	just emotionally try to be there for your friends right now.
8903000	8904000	Do what you can.
8904000	8907000	We'll keep trying to do this show best we can.
8907000	8909000	I'll try to do streaming and stuff.
8909000	8911000	My work stuff is really crazy.
8911000	8913000	I don't want to get into a lot.
8913000	8918000	All I will say is that I was on a project at work involving working at home
8918000	8922000	because it was something that more employees were going to be doing anyway over the summer.
8922000	8927000	And as you can imagine, certain things need to be done a little faster right now.
8927000	8929000	So, that's what I'm going to say about that.
8929000	8936000	But if you are able to be there emotionally and financially for friends and so forth, do so.
8936000	8940000	I'll try to do more streams if I have the time.
8940000	8946000	So, we can just hang out together in a virtual space where we are a safe social distance apart.
8946000	8947000	Be responsible.
8947000	8949000	Make good choices.
8949000	8951000	Any other last-minute thoughts from you, Loki?
8951000	8960000	No, I just have to play more Orna, and we have to get those people that joined the kingdom to join the telegram.
8960000	8962000	Oh, yeah, the telegram so we can talk to each other.
8962000	8963000	Great.
8963000	8964000	Hey, I'm glad more people are signing up.
8964000	8965000	Sounds good.
8965000	8966000	All right.
8966000	8967000	That is it.
8967000	8968000	We're done.
8968000	8969000	Oh, and Bobby, I'll say this here.
8969000	8972000	Bobby says, if anyone needs advice on how to work from home, hit me up on Discord.
8972000	8978000	I've been working at home since 2006, vognetwork.com slash Discord.
8978000	8980000	I will see you guys there during the week.
8980000	8984000	We will be back in seven days to do this all again.
8984000	8985000	That's the promise I'm making now.
8985000	8986000	We'll do our best.
8986000	8987000	So, we'll see you in seven days.
8987000	8988000	Good night, everybody.
8988000	8989000	Bye-bye.
8989000	8993000	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
