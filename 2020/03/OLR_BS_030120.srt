00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki!

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Orange Lounge Radio

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, not live tonight for a special bonus stage episode,

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
but this is the episode that will be airing at our Twitch channel on March the 1st of 2020.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So happy March! We're kind of fast-forwarding in time.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We're doing the time warp again with myself, Rob Roberts, and over there, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hi. Hi, how are you? My brain is pulp.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I know, we all had to work today. Usually when we do this show, we don't have to work, like, earlier in the day, but today we had to work.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm in the middle of training. Oh, fun! That's my job. Sort of.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's so funny that, like, because I normally work 4x10, and I'm working 5x8 this week,

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm only three days in, and I'm more tired than I would have been on a normal work day.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm hoping at some point I can switch my schedule to 4x10, because that's a thing we're allowed to do,

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
but just, you know, it hasn't logistically made sense yet.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But I at least wore my death metal shirt today, which was awesome.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Awesome. Alright, and also say hello to TechMasterLoki. Hello.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Who's dressed up in a little button-down shirt like me? I have a gamer shirt under it.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I do that too. I wear a lot of gamer shirts, except I don't remember what I have on today.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I think it's just a plain one, but a lot of times I wear gamer t-shirts and stuff underneath.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Okay, there you go. So we're all, I know you can't see it unless you're on our Twitch channel.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You just happen to be there Sunday night, because we do usually tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific,

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
9 o'clock Eastern, right after Bobby Black Wolf at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vognetwork,

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
also available at vognetwork.com. Our next live show, we will return on March 15th.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But I, how dare I, I booked a cruise, as I've been saying on the show for the past few weeks,

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
so I'm going to be gone for a little bit. And I think, Jamie, you said you're going to a sister's thing one of these nights as well, right?

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I thought that was a thing. Maybe I made that up. No, that's in April. Okay, well.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But I might be going to a GDC after party. Well, there you go. Oh, so GDC is still happening.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I've been hearing in the news this week that more and more companies are back. I think it's more stats.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm just going to go to the parties, but it's a Sony party, so I don't know if that got cancelled.

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But I got a confirmation about it today. It's like the LGBT inclusion party.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Cool. And no, it's sponsored by Microsoft. Never mind. But that's that's quite the mix up, my friend.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I can't brain. I have the Lurgy. It was the it was the Nintendo PlayStation box.

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I used up all my logic, learning logic. It's fine. It's fine. Anyway, where was I?

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I went on a tangent. I was talking about how Loki and I kind of look different on the feed today just because we're kind of we're doing this right after work.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So it's like any different. Well, no, because you're the voice. You're the voice off camera.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You're the mystery. But I'm actually not wearing anything different than what I would normally wear anyway, because my work doesn't have a dress code.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah, you're you're well, we OK. We legit do not have a dress.

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It says in our H.R. that there is no dress code.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Well, the dress code where I'm at is basically make good choices. But here's what it's really about.

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm wearing slightly nicer clothes because I can't wear anything that is going to go on the cruise with us.

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So like my jeans, I can't wear. So I have to wear like the nice because we're not going to the tropics.

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm not bringing this as much as I like this button up. Sure. It's one of my favorites. Not taking this all the way to the Bahamas.

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So I'm kind of wearing these clothes now because the other ones are starting to where we're actually packing, not the night before.

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm very proud of Alan and I. We've already started the packing process. So, yeah.

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So some of my clothes are already packed, basically. So otherwise I would wear like jeans or something more.

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I think I owe exactly three button ups and two of them are flannel. But you got one on now is a flannel.

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah, that's good. All right. Anyway, enough about fashion.

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Let's talk about video games because we are going to talk about some of the things that have happened so far in this week.

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We're about halfway through the week when we're taping this show. But again, this show is going to air on Twitch on March 1st.

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So some big things may have happened, but it may not have happened yet at the night we're taping this.

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So if we missed a headline or two, we'll catch up on all the big stories when we return live on March 15th over on Twitch.

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But for now, let's talk about one of the bigger stories that's happened so far this week and it has to do with Xbox Series X, a Microsoft story.

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Microsoft actually put out a new blog post that's teasing some more features.

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's starting to tease a little more about what's really inside it and so forth.

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So for example, I think this is actually a new confirmation, 12 teraflops of GPU performance.

57
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Of course, I have no idea. How does one measure a teraflop?

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I don't know.

59
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Five hundred thirty-five thousand floppy minutes? I don't know.

60
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's a processor. It's how fast it processes information, but I don't know.

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You said you saw some post earlier.

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
There was someone that was posting something saying it was about as powerful as 165 Gamecubes or something like that.

63
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And they had like a picture, like a graphic of Gamecubes taped together.

64
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But it still wasn't as powerful as it. It was like close. It was like twelve something.

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So you can maybe run 164 different windows with Smash Brothers Melee on it, but not 165.

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That's too many.

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
165 Gamecubes, that's like the size of the original Xbox.

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So they are saying four times more powerful than the Xbox One.

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And it's got some pretty nice specs in it.

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah, NVMe SSD, which we kind of knew about the SSD already, which is going to help speed up load times.

71
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Although I'm also hearing that the SSD, because I was seeing a different story,

72
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
kind of a somewhat unrelated story about how Sony is struggling with cost issues on the PlayStation 5.

73
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Now obviously nothing's confirmed. This is all like rumor stuff from investor forecasters and things like that.

74
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But apparently the SSD supply issue is something that's coming into question.

75
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And I don't know if that's related to COVID or if that's because of just certain technological parts kind of go in and out of demand.

76
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Like remember when everybody was buying up the graphic cards for fucking Bitcoin?

77
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah, all that stuff. So I don't know if the SSD is something like that.

78
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
They're popular.

79
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yeah, perhaps. But anyway, so Xbox Series X is planning to have the NVMe SSD.

80
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Now what also was very interesting and probably one of the highlights of the post that people were spreading around was their technology, if you want, called Smart Delivery.

81
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That's how they're branding it.

82
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And so Smart Delivery is you buy the game once and you play the best version possible either on the Series X or the Xbox One.

83
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So for example, Halo Infinite. Let's say you're not ready to buy Xbox Series X because maybe it's going to be an expensive console.

84
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And usually, especially when this last generation of games wasn't readily backwards compatible, Xbox One got there eventually.

85
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But remember it launched when Phil Spencer wasn't CEO. It launched without backwards compatibility and it never came to PlayStation 4.

86
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So right now there's a lot of mindset out there that if you buy a console, you don't get to play your old games again.

87
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Or, well, I'm going to wait and just buy this on a new console.

88
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's kind of going to be changing the way of thinking because now if I'm not ready to buy the Xbox Series X yet, but I buy Halo Infinite now for my Xbox One,

89
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'll be able to play it on Xbox Series X. Not only just play the same version, but play the enhanced version.

90
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yeah, I've got to wonder if that's going to go away at some point.

91
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I don't think so because honestly, this is how it kind of should work because that's how PCs.

92
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
This has been a strong argument in favor of PCs. You upgrade your graphics card and your game plays better.

93
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But eventually, game performance, like PCs, eventually that lower end keeps going up and up and up.

94
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I see, so eventually the game can't really be made for Xbox One anymore.

95
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yes.

96
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Well, I wonder if that's where they're going to start, and they haven't said this yet, but I wonder if that's where they're going to start relying on cloud.

97
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So this game doesn't run on the Xbox One, but we'll run it through the cloud.

98
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Maybe.

99
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And I wonder if that's the ultimate answer we end up with for Microsoft.

100
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Maybe by the time we get to that point, you know.

101
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Smart, they are also saying it's not necessarily going to be for every title. They can only really guarantee it for their titles.

102
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So the company says Smart Delivery will be standard for Xbox Game Studio titles, and it'll be available for third party developers to implement.

103
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I believe Cyberpunk has already come out and said they will be one of those games that supports the Smart Delivery.

104
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So some third parties are already getting on this, but it's not guaranteed.

105
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And I especially imagine in the indie universe it might be a little trickier.

106
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You know, I don't know how...

107
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Well, and also some of those might not necessarily be making an enhanced version as well, so it might be easier for them, who knows.

108
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Very true.

109
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Some other features they're talking about with Xbox Series X, they want to do a quick resume capability, which will let you jump back into multiple titles from where you left off.

110
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Now you can kind of do this right now on Xbox One and PlayStation 4, they're kind of the same.

111
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And Switch.

112
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Oh yeah, and Switch, right?

113
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Well, where my brain goes on PlayStation 4 is it's really good with multitasking one game and a TV service.

114
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So for example, I've been mentioning on the show the past couple of weeks I've been playing a lot of No Man's Sky, right?

115
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Well, what I might do is when I'm sick of playing No Man's Sky and I just want to veg on the couch and surf my phone, maybe I'll switch to Twitch and I'll watch one of my streamer buddies on Twitch.

116
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Well, then when I go back to No Man's Sky, I pick up right where I left off. It picks up the suspend, so it doesn't have to reload my save file, because the save files take a long time to load in that game.

117
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So I go right back to where I left off, which is kind of nice.

118
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So imagine you could do that, but with multiple games. Like you have your Halo is suspended here, your Cyberpunk is suspended here, Ori is suspended here, you can kind of go back and forth.

119
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That's kind of neat.

120
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I don't think it's a game changer, but it's kind of one of those, again, well, when you minimize a window in Windows or Mac, whatever, but I say Windows because Microsoft does Windows.

121
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I see more and more cross.

122
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I mean, I just hope it works better than loading multiple games at one time because that usually tanks performance because you have multiple games running at the same time.

123
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
True, very true.

124
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But, I mean, it's not a deal breaker if it didn't work like that. My expectation is as long as it works like it does now, then that's fine.

125
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And then one other thing that they talked about in the blog post is Dynamic Latency Input, or DLI, inside the wireless controller to reduce the delay between the buttons you're pressing and what appears on the screen.

126
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So what they're trying to do is basically make the connection between the Bluetooth controller that you use and the TV instantaneous, basically, which I don't feel like it's really been a problem.

127
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You can play music games on wireless controllers and it's fine.

128
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You might have to adjust the timing or whatever, but it's usually pretty good.

129
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So I wonder if they are trying to narrow that down, though, to help with the cloud.

130
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I imagine it's not something that's going to be as noticeable in your living room as it will be for the cloud.

131
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Because, again, in my limited use of Google Stadia, although I've played a few things, it finally ran out.

132
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So I don't have Google Stadia Pro anymore. It ran out, right?

133
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I didn't re-up it for three more months, which, by the way, you're automatically subscribed when you sign up for it.

134
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So turn it off. You don't have to talk to anybody or call anybody. You just have to go in and turn it off, or it's going to re-sub.

135
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And it might have already done that for you. Just check, unless you want to keep it.

136
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But anyway, with Stadia, I've played things like Thumper, which is kind of a music horror game, I believe they describe it as, right?

137
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It plays fine, which is the most impressive part of Stadia's technology in many ways, is that there really is an input lag.

138
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So I wonder if this is kind of part of that as well. So it's neat, and it sounds like a cool direction for Microsoft.

139
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And that's really all I have to say about these updates. But what I think is also notable about all of this is that it's keeping Microsoft's name out there.

140
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's getting the blog posts written about them and so forth. And on the other side, Sony, still kind of a question mark.

141
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Which I don't think is the end of the world. I really feel like we were doing the same song and dance.

142
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Who wants to do a song and dance?

143
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That's a very different show.

144
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Some people are into that.

145
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Stay tuned. Late nights at ball game work. Just kidding. We don't want to get banned from Twitch.

146
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
But the same old song and dance when it was the Nintendo Switch, because I'm almost positive.

147
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
We were like, when's Nintendo going to show it? When are they going to fucking show it?

148
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Like, are they ever going to announce this goddamn thing? And then they finally did, like, six weeks before it came out.

149
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And it was, they didn't have a problem.

150
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah.

151
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And Sony has followed in the path of Nintendo on a couple things. I would say the Nintendo Directs being one of them.

152
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And changing their E3 strategy. Although we know Nintendo still does E3, they don't do conferences at E3 anymore.

153
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So do you think they'll announce after Microsoft, like, especially when Microsoft announces price points and stuff, just to kind of like undercut them?

154
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I do think Sony's waiting to hear the price because now this is a rumor.

155
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:02,000
But the rumor is that when that E3 happened all those years ago, when, you know, Sony basically punched Xbox in the kidney after, you know, their performance.

156
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And undercut them by $100 and had all those videos about that.

157
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
The rumor is that Sony had three presentations ready to go at three different prices.

158
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And they were waiting for Microsoft to reveal theirs before they revealed, because, and they, it was the night, the next day.

159
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So it was like Microsoft did like Monday or whatever, and Sony was on Tuesday.

160
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So once they heard Microsoft's price, they made a decision Tuesday morning, this is the price, and they went with that presentation.

161
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But they had three presentations ready to go.

162
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
One was $100 higher and the other was $100 lower. I don't know how that would have played out, but yeah.

163
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So, interesting, huh?

164
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Anyway, that is a rumor, but it's one of those, if we want to, on this very special bonus episode of Orange Lawn's radio, as much as I hate what this has turned into,

165
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:55,000
if we want to bring back the plausibility scale for a night, the fact that Sony had three different presentations ready to go and they picked after Microsoft went,

166
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I would give a mostly green light on the plausibility scale.

167
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What about you?

168
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yeah. Yeah, it's plausible.

169
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Yeah. And I, so the fact that maybe they're making a similar type of game of chicken, of wait and see, I think is very possible.

170
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Especially because Microsoft has now committed themselves, essentially, to revealing the price and all of the details at E3.

171
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Sony hasn't. And all this stuff about Sony's going to do an event in February, Sony's going to do an event in March,

172
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
it's either off of what Sony has done before, which I know is ironic because we literally just use the plausibility scale.

173
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
They could still do that and talk about the system, but not announce the price.

174
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
That's very true. That's very true. They could.

175
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
They could do something like this where they just talk about it does this and this and this.

176
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And yes, it does look like a giant U-shaped, or I guess they're saying a V for five in Roman.

177
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Do you think it's, that's, I mean, y'all have seen the dev kits, right?

178
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
They're like, I would hope it's sleeker looking than that, because that, that thing looks like ridiculous.

179
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That thing looks like a beast. Just put it in, just like, it doesn't need the U-shape.

180
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Just put it in a PC tower case, like make it like with LEDs and stuff on it.

181
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Put a big, like, it just looks weird, but that, that's a dev kit.

182
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So, you know, no, I know we shouldn't, we can't base anything off the dev kit, but you have to wonder, you have to,

183
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
you do have to wonder because like, why shape the dev kill? Like that's weird too.

184
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Like dev kits are usually in like a PC tower case. So it's like, you know,

185
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Sony could get us to shut the fuck up about this by just showing us the console,

186
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
but that's, that's what, that's what the next few months are going to be like until it's going to be a giant boomerang,

187
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
like the boomerang controller for the PlayStation three that never happened.

188
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Oh my God. Look, I forgot about those, the boomerang controller.

189
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Those things are actually kind of cool.

190
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The Batarang.

191
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
The Batarang. Do you remember those dark soccer? They're at that one E3.

192
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
They looked uncomfortable.

193
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
They did, but they were kind of rad. Like I was like, I could, I could fuck up the Riddler with one of these.

194
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Yeah, probably.

195
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
That's cool. Bring hashtag, bring back the Batarang for a PlayStation five.

196
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Although we already know it's going to be like the same damn controller, but with, you know,

197
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
it sounds like maybe the haptic feedback type of thing, which is cool. I mean, in the reality that is probably the better solution.

198
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So, um, yeah, I, uh, it's going to be interesting to see Sony make their counter move,

199
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:26,000
but I think one thing we should all kind of be ready for is that they might not like Sony really could wait until after E3 to launch.

200
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Well, they can't, obviously they can't go that far, but they can go up to like maybe two months before.

201
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I don't know. Do you know this from having been on the other side, the retail, the retail distribution side of things?

202
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I mean, I know the industry is much different from when you were in it, but like how much lead time does a big distributor need for like,

203
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Oh, I got to put hardware on my shelf.

204
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Oh, they don't tell us until the very end.

205
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Okay.

206
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Until they've already made their announcement most of the time, unless you're a big retailer.

207
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Um, but I've like, I had conversations with this one, I don't remember like the details of it, but there,

208
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
it was all the way back to the Sega Genesis launch or maybe his master system,

209
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:08,000
but they're talking about like, he was on the product launch team for that and talking about like how they came up with the starter pack thing that they had or something like that.

210
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And how, like literally the announcement was like a banner on the roof or something like that of, you know, Sega, but he's talking about all the craziness behind that.

211
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So then sometimes they don't really know what the plan is going to be until they do the plan.

212
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Um, you know, kind of going back to the three presentation theory there, but.

213
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Yeah, like, well, you know, small distributors and you're not going to get heads up because they know that shit gonna leak.

214
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So of course they're not telling anybody until they make the announcement, then they'll send you the details if you're lucky.

215
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So, but so at the end of the day, if Sony send you like the skews to set it up or whatever, but that's about it.

216
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,000
If Sony wanted to wait till July or August to announce the console, it's not going to hurt them in the long run.

217
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Nope.

218
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So that's a reality we should, especially like in August, when you have, I don't know if they're going to games com still.

219
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So, you know, games com would be a really good time for them to pull the curtain back on it.

220
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Yeah, you're right.

221
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:12,000
They're going to, I would say, I would say games com is when you're going to get a beefy amount of information.

222
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah. Yeah.

223
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Well, yeah.

224
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And by then, hopefully you'll have more third parties announcing titles for the PlayStation five as well.

225
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And we could get something at GDC.

226
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Sony has done GDC announcements before PlayStation home. Wasn't VR.

227
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
PlayStation VR was a GDC announcement, wasn't it?

228
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I don't remember.

229
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
They have, and usually they've been or move or one of the things was like a GDC announcement.

230
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I would be curious about the next PlayStation VR as well.

231
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It is possible by the time we do our next show, or even by the time people are hearing this because of GDC, they may have said some stuff.

232
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So we'll see.

233
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
They're waiting.

234
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And we're going to sound real stupid.

235
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
They're waiting.

236
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
They're waiting for us to go on breakthrough.

237
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Now that's all the things do it now, now, now, now nobody listens to him, but it's still, we're going to fuck him over anyways.

238
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I love it.

239
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
So we'll see.

240
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Stay tuned.

241
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Uh, but if it's, if it's a little more time, then it's a little more time.

242
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I didn't want to mention though, like, cause usually when you have, um, consoles launch and stuff that the hardware that they put in them is kind of like current gen hardware.

243
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,000
But what's kind of neat though about that, our DNA, uh, GPU is that it is the brand new architecture that hasn't even launched yet.

244
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So that's like new, new, new cutting edge, new for like the, uh, GPU, which is pretty awesome.

245
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Huh.

246
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That is cool.

247
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
All right.

248
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Well, let's move on and talk about things, uh, not so new, but maybe a little new.

249
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's the types of games we've been playing this week.

250
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks.

251
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Dark Sakura.

252
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
How was your gaming week so far?

253
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Lots of ghosts and goblins.

254
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Cool.

255
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And then the usual cell phone stuff.

256
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I really have been just so brain dead with all the stuff that I have going on right now.

257
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:03,000
However, I did do something kind of gaming related that maybe the listeners will hear before too long.

258
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You can talk about it.

259
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's fine.

260
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Well, I worked on a theme song for the show.

261
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Yeah.

262
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Well, I was supposed to be paying attention in my class today.

263
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
So there's, yeah, I've heard the draft of a Dark Sakura created theme song and it's, it's good.

264
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Like it's, you know, it's, um, yeah, we gotta, we gotta just, you know, the timing.

265
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yeah.

266
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yeah.

267
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm excited for everybody to hear it.

268
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
So stay tuned.

269
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And then poking a couple of somebodies.

270
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Yes.

271
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Yes.

272
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Obviously voiceover guy, Jason will still be here to do the voiceovers every week, but

273
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
we need a new voice for the, um, you know, it's orange lounge radio with dark Sakura,

274
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Robert, you know, and that whole thing.

275
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So, uh, not that we don't appreciate what MIDI had did for us.

276
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Oh yes.

277
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And stream him on Spotify, support him please.

278
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
He's helped us out a bunch over the years, but it's just, we've had that theme song for

279
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
over 10 years.

280
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's time for, and I got to play a lot in logic, which was fun.

281
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I, the more I use it, the more I really enjoy it.

282
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
So, so we'll see.

283
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yep.

284
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
But that's what I was doing.

285
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
All right.

286
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
How about you, Loki?

287
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Um, I just played more Minecraft with the kids.

288
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,360
So on our realm that we have, um, I went to the nether and tried to find another fortress

289
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:22,360
and I was like, okay, well I'm going to make a, you know, a portal to this nether fortress.

290
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,200
And then of course, every block in the nether is eight blocks in the surface.

291
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:33,680
And like, I literally walked for like five, five days in there and I still wasn't close

292
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,200
to where I was supposed to the actual village that we're in.

293
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:46,000
So I just gave up and killed myself so I could spawn back at the village cause I'm like,

294
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
this is taking too long.

295
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,880
They're like, you're never going to get back, you're just gone forever.

296
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:58,400
So it's like, well, well, I'll find another one that's closer.

297
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,400
So I was doing that.

298
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,400
All right.

299
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,400
That it?

300
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
Oh, an ornament.

301
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,640
I'm upgrading a level 10 weapon, so I have to wait three days for that stupid thing.

302
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,640
Oh gosh.

303
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,640
Wow.

304
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,640
I never had, it ends tonight though.

305
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,640
So, okay.

306
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,880
I was like, I don't have enough material to do past like level four or five.

307
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,880
So wow.

308
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,880
Good for you.

309
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,880
Yeah.

310
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,880
Nice.

311
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
All right.

312
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,880
Don't take my land though.

313
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,000
They need to do something like, you're right.

314
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,200
There's like one person who has like easily half this town.

315
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:32,160
So like they need to do something where like if he or she is not regularly going to that

316
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,200
place, then they need like a deterioration mechanic.

317
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,680
Like how an ingress portals decay, how in Pokemon go gyms, the Pokemon get weaker as

318
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,680
time goes on.

319
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,680
Right.

320
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,680
Yeah.

321
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,880
Orna really needs something like that because otherwise it's just about who claimed it the

322
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,200
earliest and then leveled up to level two 50.

323
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
So nobody can take them out.

324
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,880
Oh, eventually I'll get to that point and then it's just going to be like, game on.

325
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,880
It's just gone.

326
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,880
Take it all over.

327
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,880
Yeah.

328
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,880
It's all mine.

329
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,080
Declaring open war on what's her name.

330
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,720
So I think Mike, the two, the shadow looks females.

331
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,720
I don't know.

332
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,720
I don't know who it does.

333
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,720
It doesn't matter.

334
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,720
Damn you.

335
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,720
Auntie St. Mike.

336
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,720
Their number is up.

337
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,720
All right.

338
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,800
Well, that's not the name I was thinking of.

339
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,080
There's another name, like everywhere, like downtown and yeah.

340
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,440
So my area is auntie St. Mike and the ghost of auntie St.

341
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,440
Calleria or something like that.

342
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,440
That's the one I see everywhere.

343
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,480
And part of like, yeah, they have like, it's the something ornate, something of the burrito

344
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,480
or I don't remember.

345
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,560
Oh, they're a little, they're a little guilt.

346
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,680
And look, I'm, I I'm all for, Hey, if people are going to be aggressive and want to play

347
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,600
the game hard and control their territory.

348
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,600
That's fine.

349
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,600
That's what Ingress is all about.

350
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,600
You know?

351
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,600
But, uh, I just think the game shouldn't like reward somebody for just like you get really

352
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,600
much.

353
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,840
It's like you get 10 gold every day, but you can't create your own kingdom until you have

354
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,280
100 pieces of land.

355
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,680
You need a hundred reputation.

356
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,260
Oh yeah.

357
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,440
You can't create your own kingdom until you have a hundred.

358
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,620
Oh, I didn't know you can even make a kingdom.

359
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,680
So it's, it's a pain.

360
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,680
All right.

361
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,680
That it for your game week.

362
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,680
That's it.

363
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,680
That's it for this week.

364
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,320
So, um, I haven't played a lot cause it's still early in the week, but continuing with

365
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,880
Final Fantasy 14, cause I'm a nerd, got to get my tomes, kept my tomes.

366
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,480
Uh, and then I've been playing no man's sky still just a little bit.

367
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,920
I haven't been playing a lot this week, but what I did do.

368
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,900
So do you guys remember on the last show I mentioned that I took, I took a really great

369
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,580
screenshot and no man's sky that I loved.

370
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,580
So guess what?

371
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:23,600
So I decided to take my favorite virtual exploration game and combine it with my real world exploration

372
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,600
game.

373
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,620
So I made a banner in Ingress, a mission banner out of that screenshot.

374
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,420
So I only had time to do the first row by walking around the park and sadly I can't

375
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,500
put this on screen yet, but that's what it looks like.

376
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,860
So yeah, if you want to see that you can actually see it's a little screenshot from the game

377
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,660
and actually you can see my little Explorer there in the corner and uh, yeah, I thought

378
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,660
that was really cool.

379
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,660
So, uh, yeah.

380
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,540
Now I just have to finish the rest of it because once I do the, uh, cause I did the walk, it's,

381
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,780
it's one part walking and then you have to kind of drive a big loop around town just

382
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,420
cause it's the only way I can get enough portals.

383
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,280
I didn't want to do like another banner downtown.

384
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,280
There's already like a million of them.

385
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,400
So I did this one on the East side of town, like McKinley park, if you know where that

386
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,840
is, that's where this one of the all like that's, you have to walk that park to get

387
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,840
that first part.

388
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,100
Um, and then it's, or it's the lady, it's the lady bird park.

389
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,360
If you saw the movie, it's the Rose garden that they have a scene in.

390
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:17,600
I used to walk around that park every day at lunch when I worked at the cannery.

391
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,880
Yeah, it's a lovely park.

392
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,040
So mission four or something of that mission starts at that Rose garden.

393
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,040
So there you go.

394
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,160
A little, a little, uh, so if you've seen that movie, you know what I'm talking about.

395
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,120
Um, but anyway, uh, so that, that mission series is there and I'm looking forward to

396
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,920
doing the rest of it, which will have the kind of like Saturn looking planet behind

397
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,920
it with the rings.

398
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,920
It's very giant.

399
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,200
And this, this kind of the solar burst, I'm really excited to do that.

400
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,120
I like being able to mix my favorite games together like that.

401
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,120
So cool.

402
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,120
Yeah, it's fun.

403
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,120
Anyway.

404
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,120
All right.

405
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,120
So that was my gaming week.

406
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,440
Let's get into some of the headlines this week so far.

407
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,440
Yes.

408
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,560
So unfortunately we're going to start with some sad news.

409
00:26:54,560 --> 00:27:04,480
So the creator of the Konami code, uh, Kazu, um, Hisha Hashimoto has died at age 61.

410
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,480
That's pretty young.

411
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,240
All things considered 61 is not old.

412
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,680
The age is actually disputed because it either says 61 or 79, depending on what source you

413
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,680
look at.

414
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,680
Oh, that's a huge discrepancy.

415
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,680
Yeah.

416
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,680
It's a big discrepancy.

417
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,680
Big discrepancy.

418
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,680
Right.

419
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,680
Regardless.

420
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,500
Uh, still sad to hear, but, uh, I didn't know, I guess I never knew that the actual code

421
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,620
was attributed to like one person.

422
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,620
I have to admit I did.

423
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,620
I did not know.

424
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,620
Did you know that Jim?

425
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,620
Maybe you did.

426
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,620
I didn't know it was attributed to just one person.

427
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:35,140
I thought it was just some type of like nebulous internal, you know, sometimes those old cheat

428
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,500
codes from back in the day.

429
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:41,100
But how many people were actually programmers on games during the NES era?

430
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,100
True.

431
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,100
True.

432
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,100
True.

433
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,100
No, you're right.

434
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,100
Or in the Atari 2600 era.

435
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,100
Right.

436
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,620
It was like one person made all those games or what, or would do a game.

437
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,460
Um, and, um, in the NES era, you're right.

438
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,860
It would be a small team, probably 10 or less that would make those games.

439
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,860
So that's true.

440
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:01,620
Um, and a lot of those old codes kind of came from, they were like bug testing or dev codes

441
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,700
basically.

442
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,460
So like other people weren't supposed to know the code.

443
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,820
So was Gradius the first game to use it?

444
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,820
Probably had to have been.

445
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,820
Right.

446
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,820
So use up.

447
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,820
Yeah.

448
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,820
Up, up, down, left, right, left, right, B, A start.

449
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,380
And that is what gets your ship all the like full power and everything.

450
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:18,940
So you can, you know, test the level a different way than having to earn it all.

451
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:23,340
So, and a lot of old cheat codes and I think even passwords and things like that were for

452
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,340
this.

453
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:28,940
Um, and they just would get left in the game because you know, back in the day it wasn't

454
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,660
as easy to just patch things out, you know, or things like that.

455
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:36,900
So they would just get left in the game and then eventually someone squeals, you know,

456
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,260
one of those devs tells their friend, you know, you can do this, you know, and then

457
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,020
that friend tells another friend and word spreads around.

458
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,980
I mean, I have a hard time believing somebody that word spreads to game pro magazine and

459
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,020
Exactly.

460
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:52,260
Or, or, you know, when, and I bet this technique was used.

461
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,260
Absolutely.

462
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:58,580
When sales of the game start slowing down, Oh, did you know there's a code generate interest

463
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:02,060
in the game again, get it printed in the next magazine so people can rent it or check it

464
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,060
out.

465
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:06,580
I'm absolutely sure that was part of the strategy back in the day.

466
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:11,220
Now it's, you know, sell them, sell them an unlock code for 99 cents.

467
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,220
But

468
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:18,460
And then we've got news that platinum games is publishing its own original game under

469
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:25,380
the working title project GG is that unlike any of the games we've made so far, it's going

470
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:32,120
to be a hundred percent platinum games title for everything from its yeah, for everything

471
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:37,820
from its setting to its characters and its game design and story to how it's promoted.

472
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,220
Platinum games is in full control.

473
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,700
And by the time this airs, they'll know what it is.

474
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,700
Right.

475
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,460
Cause I believe I heard platinum is pulling back the curtain on it tomorrow.

476
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,820
So yeah, they have a teaser.

477
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:51,660
So we'll have to wait and see, unfortunately you guys know something we don't know yet.

478
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,280
So I'm hearing a lot of chatter.

479
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:59,660
People think it might be beautiful Joe, another entry in the beautiful Joe series, but I mean,

480
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,660
it could be an original IP.

481
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,700
It looks a little more screenshots that they have.

482
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:08,540
Don't look like beautiful Joe, but wait and see where things have happened.

483
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,980
So yeah, we'll see.

484
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:15,060
I'm all, I'm all for original IP or what if it's, um, fucking, especially because they

485
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,280
say a hundred percent platinum and it's all plaid.

486
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,700
What if it's scaled down?

487
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,380
Remember how Microsoft stopped that way?

488
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,620
Cause that's the one thing I'm going to read into a little bit is how they say it's a hundred

489
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,620
percent platinum.

490
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,620
It's all platinum.

491
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,460
Like they're kind of framing something there.

492
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,460
Right.

493
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,460
I don't know.

494
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,460
Just okay.

495
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,460
I'm going to look stupid.

496
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,460
Cause y'all know something I don't yet.

497
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,460
So we're playing time warp here.

498
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,460
So we'll see.

499
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,460
All right.

500
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,460
Um, and this is kind of cool.

501
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:43,660
Uh, since I was just talking about Minecraft, you may remember back in 2013 that there was

502
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:49,140
a mass effect data pack for Minecraft that was released, which allowed you to play as

503
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:55,880
the skins of the characters from a mass effect, as well as, um, they had some of the, uh,

504
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,820
worlds and stuff from that as well.

505
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,020
I didn't know they got rid of it.

506
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:03,380
Well, yeah, it hasn't been compatible with the newer versions of Minecraft until just

507
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,380
now.

508
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:08,660
So you can actually play it on X-Box one PlayStation four, switch PC and mobile.

509
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,660
Got it.

510
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,660
Okay.

511
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,860
I just assumed, I guess maybe I didn't understand enough about how Minecraft worked.

512
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:16,160
I just assumed, Oh, you could only get it on the three 60 and whatever they don't sell

513
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,160
it on the other ones.

514
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,420
I didn't realize it was a compatibility.

515
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,420
Well, that's cool.

516
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,620
Have you ever seen the, um, because I know you're a big mass effect stand like me.

517
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:26,680
Have you ever seen like the Minecrafts or the mass effect skin for Minecraft?

518
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,860
Have I played Minecraft any, and in at least a year, it's super cute though, which I haven't

519
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,860
seen it.

520
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:37,160
Um, speaking of playing things in a year, uh, I'll give you guys an Allen update.

521
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:41,700
Allen is playing the mass effect trilogy from the start once again, because he said it's

522
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,560
been years and I want to play it again.

523
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,380
So that is his current like game of the moment.

524
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,540
I like how he thinks he's still on mass effect one.

525
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,020
It's been a couple of weeks, but that's, that's, that's very much because I know what he's

526
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,020
doing.

527
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,500
He's playing every single mission in the game.

528
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,180
That's what I always do.

529
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,180
Yep.

530
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:01,460
So anyway, um, and then speaking of Minecraft some more, and then we'll also talk about

531
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:06,820
it a little bit, Metroid fusion, somebody for some reason spent seven years of their

532
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:15,140
time programming Metroid fusion into Minecraft, actually recreating the game using tire game

533
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,140
or like just that.

534
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:22,460
Um, that's, I don't know if it's completely done yet, but, uh, basically he's got it.

535
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:27,460
It's all with command blocks and just, it's ridiculous.

536
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,820
Like the sprites and everything.

537
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:34,540
Now I would have thought this is made in dreams on PlayStation four or something like that.

538
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,540
Nope.

539
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:42,900
But yeah, they've got like, um, some images like that he shared back like years ago, but

540
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,900
it's just ridiculous.

541
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,820
But he's saying he's going to continue working on it until Nintendo shuts him down.

542
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,820
But he says he's fine.

543
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,940
He's a hundred percent fine with that, which will be tomorrow.

544
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,140
Well, it's been going on for seven years.

545
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,220
Is it something that can be put in Minecraft on the switch?

546
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:04,460
I don't know if that would be able to run to like, cause the, all the console versions

547
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,260
are kind of limited on how much space you have and all that.

548
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,260
Right.

549
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,260
Yeah.

550
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,260
It was pretty hard.

551
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,260
Um, but yeah, that's pretty crazy.

552
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,520
That'd be kind of funny if he put it on the switch and it's like, just try and shut me

553
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,520
down now.

554
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,520
This is funny.

555
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,740
Hackers can put it on the switch.

556
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,740
True.

557
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,740
True.

558
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:23,100
Um, and then we got it since we are just about the approach March, we've got our games of

559
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,780
gold and PlayStation.

560
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,060
You mean we're in March?

561
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,060
It's March 1st.

562
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,060
March 1st.

563
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,060
Today.

564
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,060
Right.

565
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,060
Check your calendar, Loki.

566
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,340
But these games haven't released yet, so that's fine.

567
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:37,260
Um, so on the Xbox side of things, we have Batman and the enemy within the complete season.

568
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,380
Um, and then we have Shantae half genie hero.

569
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,220
Those are the Xbox one games.

570
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:47,660
And then on Xbox three 60 Castlevania, Lord of shadows two and Sonic generations.

571
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,620
I'm sorry, but Lords of shadow one was bad enough.

572
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,660
Why did they have to give us two?

573
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,580
Because Konami has got to make some money.

574
00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:01,940
And then, um, on the PlayStation side, we've got, uh, Sonic forces and shadow of the Colossus.

575
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,940
Okay.

576
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,940
Neat.

577
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,940
So not bad.

578
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:11,420
And then, uh, last but not least, uh, good old games has changed their refund policy.

579
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:20,060
So now if you play or purchase a game, you have 30 days after you purchase to, um, you

580
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,460
know, file for a refund.

581
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,740
However, there are, you know, and they're basically, they're saying that we trust that

582
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:31,620
you're making an informed purchase decisions and we'll use this updated voluntary refund

583
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,620
policy.

584
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:37,060
Only if something doesn't work for you as expected while there's a, this is why there

585
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:40,580
are no limits, but instead we reserve the right for refuse refunds.

586
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:47,540
In individual cases, please respect all the time and hard work, uh, put into making game

587
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,220
or making the games that you play.

588
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,900
And remember the refunds are not reviews.

589
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:55,780
If you finish the game and didn't like it, please consider sharing your opinion and said

590
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:00,380
also please don't take advantage of our trust by asking for an unreasonable amount of games

591
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,820
to be refunded.

592
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,360
Don't be that person.

593
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,380
No one likes that person.

594
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:11,740
So I like that, um, that comment there at the end, but yeah, I do feel like this might

595
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:17,060
open them up for some problems, but I mean, I'm just, I'm pretty sure that they're aware

596
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:22,700
of how people can be because there are those people out there that will do this, but you

597
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:27,020
know, I like that it's kind of open to, you know, don't be a dick because we'll know that

598
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:32,460
you're being a deck and we're not going to give you your refund.

599
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:37,060
That's very, that really opens it up though for like people to buy a game, beat the game,

600
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,860
refund the game, like using this as a rental system.

601
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:43,380
They can look at it and see them kind of seeing that that's what you're doing.

602
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,380
Okay.

603
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,380
Yeah.

604
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,380
All right.

605
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,740
So I suppose I'd be very curious what the statistics look like a little bit after this.

606
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:54,040
I mean, sometimes when you kind of trust, like, you know, there's a lot of games out

607
00:35:54,040 --> 00:36:00,300
there that just don't have any DRM at all and they still sell pretty darn well, even

608
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,300
with piracy.

609
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,300
I don't think these games have DRM.

610
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,300
I don't think they do either.

611
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,420
So, but that's kind of a, if you think about it though, that still kind of sucks though

612
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:11,260
for the individual, because I'm assuming that GOG isn't taking a hit on this stuff.

613
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:14,860
So that kind of sucks for the indie developers that put out some of these games on the service

614
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:19,580
and then 30 days later, you know, they may be getting money taken away from them.

615
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,580
Depends on the abuse.

616
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,580
It depends what maybe GOG's promised them about how they're going to enforce it.

617
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:28,500
Like, you know, if a person does this X many of times, an X window, we're going to review

618
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:33,540
the play time and maybe, you know, not allow them to use the system anymore.

619
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,540
So we'll see.

620
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:37,760
Or GOG has achievements, right?

621
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,740
So that's what the achievements can come back to bite you because you will look at the achievements

622
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,460
to see the person beat the game and then refunded it.

623
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:45,580
And it's like, okay, come on, what are you doing?

624
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,140
So it's going to be an interesting way to monitor the accounts.

625
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,140
I don't know.

626
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,140
All right.

627
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,140
All right.

628
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:54,780
Well, if that's it from you, let's let's check in with Dark Soccer and see what stories she

629
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,780
wants to talk about tonight.

630
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,260
There's always shenanigans, you know.

631
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,260
There is.

632
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:02,220
Well, Harmonics has unveiled a new game.

633
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,700
It's called Fuser, where it is a mixing game.

634
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:11,460
You play as a DJ at a festival, as long as it's not Coachella because the owner is a

635
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:14,020
bad person.

636
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:19,140
So it looks like they're going to have over one hundred songs that you can mix in real

637
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,140
time.

638
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:26,060
So you grab vocals from one and the guitar from another mashup simulator.

639
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:32,500
Pretty much it's it's literally drop mix like Harmonics already did this game, except there's

640
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,180
a twist.

641
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,520
Drop mix is a board game.

642
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,540
It's a tangible thing with real cards.

643
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,100
This is going to sell better.

644
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,220
This is going to sell better.

645
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,260
And it's Magic the Gathering online, basically.

646
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,260
Right.

647
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,260
Yeah.

648
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:50,620
But basically, yeah, it's like you're going to be managing from from you have four different

649
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:58,700
decks and you have a few restrictions on what you can do.

650
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,620
But it has to be the four.

651
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:07,060
So it's going to be on Switch, PS4, PC and the Xbone.

652
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,220
So we'll see what it comes out like.

653
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,340
It looks like it could be fun.

654
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:15,380
Yeah, I mean, I love drop mix like it's cool, but I understand like the game itself for

655
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:19,700
drop mix is kind of like it's like it's it's one of those games.

656
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,700
Do you remember?

657
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,780
Do you remember the board game Mouse Trap that never worked?

658
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,780
Yeah.

659
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:28,340
Well, it was also more fun to just set up the trap or try to put the trap in different

660
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:33,620
ways or, you know, try to see what other weird things you can do with the parts than it was

661
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:36,080
to actually play mouse trap.

662
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,500
And I think that's the kind of thing that happens with drop mix.

663
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,620
Like it's more fun to just sit there and play with the cards and make your own mixes

664
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:46,460
than it is like actually played drop mix music going back to the 70s on here.

665
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,860
I mean, oh, the song list is great.

666
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,860
Yeah.

667
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:56,580
I mean, though, we've got Blue Oyster Cult, The Clash, some Gaga, some Lizzo, of course.

668
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,580
Yes.

669
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:01,340
Gaga, you know, through the 90s, the aughts through all of it.

670
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:04,500
So it looks like it could be pretty interesting.

671
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,500
I mean, hello.

672
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,740
Y'all know I love music games.

673
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,740
I'll buy it.

674
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,740
Of course.

675
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,740
Exactly.

676
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,740
Yeah.

677
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,740
Yeah.

678
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,780
So, um, that's the wrong link.

679
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:17,060
I was helping somebody find beard sanitizer.

680
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:24,580
Oh, I was like, no, it's an immunocompromised friend who has worries about the now airborne

681
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:30,060
COVID, the now local and airborne.

682
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,060
I thought there was only one case here locally.

683
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,060
Yeah, I know.

684
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,020
It's some big deal.

685
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,100
I'm not worried.

686
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,340
I'm not bothered.

687
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:43,740
I'm about to go on a cruise and hopefully, um, it doesn't take me a month to get back.

688
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,740
Who knows?

689
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,180
This might be the last OLR for six minutes.

690
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,180
So many announcements.

691
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,980
They're like, oh my God, open the floodgates now.

692
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:56,120
I just hope it's not like it was a few years ago when I had swine flu and didn't know it.

693
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,580
If there's any, if there's any, if, if I do end up trapped on a boat due to COVID, at

694
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:04,580
least I'll be trapped on a boat with Wilson Cruz and Kate Mulgrew.

695
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:08,900
So it's like, you know, I will, I will play with your cat.

696
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,900
Okay.

697
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,900
Thank you.

698
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,540
I already told Dan I was going to come over to entertain the smush.

699
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,540
Oh God, that's right.

700
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,540
Oh my God.

701
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,740
How would we take care of the cat?

702
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,980
You would honestly like, I'll just, you would have to just take some motion to your own

703
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:19,980
home.

704
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,340
He and Midna would fight over the food bowl.

705
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,340
Well, it's just, yeah.

706
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,700
And why are we even entertaining this?

707
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,700
It's not going to happen.

708
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:28,700
Why are we even entertaining this?

709
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,420
Anyways, streets of rage four.

710
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,580
We like to fantasize about all the bad things that can happen to us.

711
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:42,380
Well, just drew posted on Facebook a little bit ago, the, the quote from a welcome to

712
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,380
Night Vale.

713
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,900
May all of your dreams come true.

714
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,900
All of them.

715
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:50,620
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

716
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,700
Anyway, streets of rage four.

717
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,940
It's getting some new stuff.

718
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:01,180
When it launches, there is going to be two person online co-op.

719
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,980
Yay.

720
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:08,660
And up to four player offline co-op, yay.

721
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:13,980
And there's going to be a new playable characters.

722
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:21,100
One of them is Floyd, who is cybernetic.

723
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:27,340
He actually was upgraded due to Dr. Zan from streets of rage three.

724
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:30,100
He's slow, but strong.

725
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:38,220
So yeah, streets of rage four, hopefully, hopefully it's going to be awesome.

726
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,540
Well, Yuzuru Koshiro is doing the music.

727
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,540
That's all I need.

728
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,540
Okay.

729
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,540
That's all I care about then.

730
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,980
And there better be bare knuckle arcade machines in it.

731
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,980
We'll see.

732
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:50,780
So little bit more.

733
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:57,940
Dragon Ball Fighter, Dragon Ball Fighter's season three has gone live with a bunch of

734
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,380
different changes.

735
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:05,180
You get something called Z assist that gives you assist attacks for every member of the

736
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:08,740
roster, kind of like how it worked for Marvel versus Capcom.

737
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:13,940
And it lets you create even crazier combos in the game.

738
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:19,820
You would be able to choose your partner for like juggling or projectile or a little bit

739
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:20,820
more on that.

740
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:24,300
So it'll be, it'll be pretty neat.

741
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:29,020
Few other things is that you will have a limit break.

742
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,020
Thanks Final Fantasy seven.

743
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,180
I was like, what is this Final Fantasy?

744
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,180
Right.

745
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:38,460
But basically when the player is down to their last fighter, they will get a slight damage

746
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:44,340
boost and a free bar of meter allowing, which would basically make them do like a last stand

747
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,340
attack.

748
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:48,500
That's kind of similar to Mortal Kombat 11's fatal blows.

749
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,980
So it's really just a combat mechanic.

750
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,360
And then some new characters.

751
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:57,380
So Kefla will be in there.

752
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:04,060
And then there will also be ultra instinct Goku.

753
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:09,980
All the Goku will be in the game, but I don't know.

754
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:13,320
I mean this character, she kind of annoyed me in the series.

755
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:17,580
So I mean she was cool, but annoying in the series.

756
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:20,900
So yeah, some, some cool stuff.

757
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,780
Played the Dragon Ballses.

758
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:28,900
I still have yet to unfortunately play this game, but at some point I'll play it eventually.

759
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,260
I reckon.

760
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:33,100
You know, I'm looking at this next story that I'm going to talk about.

761
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:37,220
And there's a, it's, this is one of those cases of advertising working because I'm presented

762
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:41,780
with a giant ad for the Double Dragon and Kunio-kun retro brawler bundle, which is kind

763
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,640
of neat, which I remember discussing on a previous show.

764
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,920
What I forgot was that, oh, it's like coming out like now, or in this case it's already

765
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,920
out.

766
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,920
I forgot.

767
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,920
So you've played it.

768
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,920
You and Dan have played it?

769
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,920
Our friend has it.

770
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,560
He brought over a Switch and we enjoyed some of it.

771
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,560
It was pretty fun.

772
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,560
Is it neat?

773
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,560
Yeah.

774
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,560
I can't wait to play some of this.

775
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,560
It's old school.

776
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,560
Yeah.

777
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,560
It's the classics.

778
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,400
And I'm excited that we have like new games in English basically.

779
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,400
This is a trend.

780
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,160
And it's the old school, like legit Niketsu games.

781
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,160
Yeah.

782
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:14,260
This is this random trend I'm loving all of a sudden is like all of these old ass retro

783
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:18,180
games are suddenly getting localized for mother three.

784
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,180
Fuck you.

785
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:24,820
Well, to be fair, mother three already was localized for Europe, but yeah, anyway, I

786
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:25,820
know.

787
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:26,820
Oh, I guess.

788
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:27,820
Yeah.

789
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:28,820
We continue to get screwed when it comes to mother three.

790
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:31,900
But, uh, well I was thinking trials of manna of course was the thing on my brain.

791
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:32,900
So there's that.

792
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:33,900
So, all right.

793
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:37,860
Uh, anyway, the story I was actually going to read before I got distracted by a giant

794
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:38,860
advertisement.

795
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:46,940
Um, was talking a little bit about, um, the, um, no, Alan just got home.

796
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,940
That's not the cat.

797
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:48,940
He liked it.

798
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:49,940
The cat get out.

799
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:50,940
Well, cause it didn't shut the door all the way.

800
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:51,940
No, you're fine.

801
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:52,940
You're fine.

802
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,940
Alan is probably opening a window.

803
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:54,940
Um, it is.

804
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:55,940
It is a little hot in here.

805
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:00,580
Um, it's just me anyway.

806
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:04,140
The story, the 2020 PlayStation player celebration.

807
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,140
That's right.

808
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:08,380
Uh, you have a chance to play more games and earn more trophies this year.

809
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,340
It's the PlayStation player celebration.

810
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:15,180
If the community hits some different milestones, such as half a million trophies, uh, you get

811
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:23,580
exclusive PS4 themes and avatars and, and one of the big prizes, a real life platinum

812
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:24,980
trophy.

813
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:25,980
That's right.

814
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:30,260
You can have a platinum trophy IRL and you can show all your friends just how big your

815
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:33,140
E-penis is with your, uh, put that on your Tinder profile.

816
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:34,140
That's right.

817
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,140
Put that on your Tinder profile.

818
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:36,140
Anyway.

819
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:37,620
Um, this just got underway.

820
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:42,900
I think February 24th was in the first community goals started, uh, which was a 125,000 games

821
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,460
played and 500,000 trophies earned.

822
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:49,180
There will be an exclusive static PS4 theme.

823
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:53,540
And I imagine that, um, people were probably going to unlock all these things anyway.

824
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:57,700
I just, I just don't see how the community doesn't actually unlock all these things.

825
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,300
So cause they put pretty achievable goals in there.

826
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,300
Yeah.

827
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:05,780
They probably know like the averages and they probably bumped it up slightly, but not too

828
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:06,780
much.

829
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:09,660
So it's, it's, I'm sure it'll, it'll be effective.

830
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:14,820
So, um, and then the only other things I really wanted to talk about, oops, I just randomly

831
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:18,580
closed the story, but I remember that, uh, there's some changes with Overwatch.

832
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:24,060
Uh, one of them is that the, uh, Overwatch league matches, some of them are getting canceled

833
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:28,340
due to COVID, um, which is kind of not new news right now.

834
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:29,340
Right.

835
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:32,400
We've hearing a lot of different things are getting canceled or people backing out or

836
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,400
so forth.

837
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,780
It will be interesting to see how PAX East went.

838
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:37,980
Um, I'm not, I'm not worried about COVID.

839
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:42,740
I'm just thinking about like how that goes with a lot of the folks that have dropped

840
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:45,820
out, you know, but you know, having been to PAX and we've all been to PAX.

841
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:48,540
I mean, we went to PAX prime one year, all of us together.

842
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,540
That was a fun year.

843
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:54,740
Um, but you know, there's a lot of like board games going on 24 seven and land and you know,

844
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,220
people just celebrating gaming.

845
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:59,940
So I feel like there's, it's not like there's going to be a shortage of things to do.

846
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:03,780
It's just that, you know, the expo hall is going to be a little, little less exciting,

847
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,780
but they've still got Indies.

848
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,020
They got plenty of stuff to see.

849
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:13,700
So anyway, um, but the Overwatch league, South Korean matches are being canceled due to the,

850
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:19,020
um, novel coronavirus worries or COVID, um, because, uh, unfortunately the more and more

851
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:22,980
and more and more cases are showing up in South Korea, just like we're hearing in Italy.

852
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:27,080
Uh, and, um, what was it Iran, I think is the other big one since we last did a show.

853
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:30,220
So fortunately it's, unfortunately it's spreading.

854
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:33,540
Um, so some more events are being affected because of it.

855
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:37,700
But something that will definitely affect everyone in Overwatch is a new experimental

856
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:38,700
mode.

857
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,900
So you may or may not know, depending on how much you play Overwatch, they changed the

858
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:47,380
queuing system sometimes ago to be two tanks, two healers and two DPS.

859
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:50,580
So that way you kind of queue for matches in a certain role.

860
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:57,700
Well, uh, Overwatch is now testing a new mode where you can actually do three DPS and one

861
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,380
tank and two healers.

862
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:02,460
Uh, so they call it triple DPS or something like that, triple damage.

863
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:03,460
That's it.

864
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,360
And they're calling it an experimental mode.

865
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,740
So it's, it's not like they didn't replace the two, two, two system with this as a side

866
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:09,740
thing.

867
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:13,340
Um, but it's supposed to help improve queue times because everybody wants to be DPS.

868
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:15,600
Everybody wants to play Hanzo for some reason.

869
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,020
So this is supposed to help those queue times.

870
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:23,640
So and the feedback on this will make Blizzard decide if they want to implement this into

871
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,640
standard play.

872
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,660
Uh, a quote from, um, Jeff Kaplan, who is the lead designer, the experimental card is

873
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:33,820
really focused on radical gameplay changes or things that we want to try out to get your

874
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,660
direct player feedback on.

875
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,540
We are unsure of these.

876
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,980
Um, so we'll see how that goes.

877
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:44,000
Most people I've seen on Twitter seem to be enjoying it so far though, and it makes sense.

878
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,980
So it's just changing one tank to a DPS and more people want to queue as DPS anyway.

879
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:49,980
So it makes sense.

880
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:50,980
Yeah.

881
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:51,980
So we'll see where that goes.

882
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:55,420
Anyway, that is it for the stories that we were going to cover tonight.

883
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:58,940
So we're going to go into the listener round table since we're not live tonight, we can't

884
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:03,340
take your, um, phone calls on discord, but we can talk about some of the stories that

885
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,620
you guys have been posting on discord.

886
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:08,900
Um, you guys have been posting a lot of stories and I think we already touched on some of

887
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:09,900
them.

888
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,820
Like I know the Konami code one came up and some other things, but I thought this one

889
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:13,820
was really cute.

890
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:18,380
So we got linked to a story that talks about Nintendo's customer support going above and

891
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:21,580
beyond, uh, for an older lady.

892
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:25,260
Um, and, uh, this was reported in a local newspaper.

893
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:31,020
Um, I think it was picked up off of Twitter, but basically long story short, um, this gal's

894
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,260
mom always played her Game Boy.

895
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:40,700
Um, and when she reached the age of 85, 95, her Game Boy stopped working, but they wanted

896
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:44,020
her to be able to be happy and still play Tetris on Game Boy and stuff.

897
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:47,740
So they called Nintendo to try to fix the Game Boy, but of course the Game Boy, they're

898
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,580
no longer supported, right?

899
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:52,260
Well, Nintendo's support went above and beyond.

900
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:58,060
And what happened, they, they found a, um, I guess they got within a week of response

901
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:03,460
saying they didn't have the parts, but they found a brand new Game Boy in a warehouse

902
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:06,580
of like, you know, this actually is a very common thing.

903
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:13,020
I'm thinking like the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark that, well, companies do keep surplus

904
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,660
stock on hand.

905
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:20,180
Case in point, go back to those cases of why Atari had a landfill at one point, because

906
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:23,260
there was so much surplus stock because everything got sent back.

907
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,060
They literally had no place to put it.

908
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:30,440
But it's not super uncommon for companies to hold on to surplus stock of certain things.

909
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,740
Four cases kind of like this, actually.

910
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:37,380
Like I know my high school, I know this because I was on the yearbook committee in high school,

911
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:41,340
there's a, there was a shed out back that was a storage shed and what they had, they

912
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:47,420
had one box of every yearbook they've ever printed over the years.

913
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:50,060
So when I was, there was like 30 years worth of yearbooks and there's probably another

914
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:51,700
30 years worth of yearbooks there now.

915
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:56,920
And it was specifically for when people would call the school and say, my house burned down

916
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:01,000
or I lost this in a fire or is there any way I can replace this?

917
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,540
They have one box of books to be able to, so if you've ever lost your yearbook, call

918
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:09,440
your school, they might have something if that's something of importance to you.

919
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,400
So I thought that was kind of neat.

920
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,540
So I think this is, this is partially that and partially just sometimes you don't know

921
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,380
where else to put this shit.

922
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,700
Like, have you ever looked at your garage?

923
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,420
You probably have a lot of shit out there that you don't really need.

924
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:26,220
And I think a lot of this happens with Nintendo too.

925
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,460
It wouldn't really surprise me.

926
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:34,340
I mean, I've bought sealed in box old stuff from work, you know, not going to say where

927
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,660
I work, but I've done it before.

928
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,660
Sure.

929
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:38,660
Yeah.

930
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:41,820
So anyway, you know, so I don't think it's quite as novel that they still have one on

931
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:45,220
hand, but what is novel is the fact that they did, they went the extra mile and sent her

932
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:49,320
that for free with a letter wishing a nice long life.

933
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:53,940
And as a nice footnote here, the grandmother lived to be 99.

934
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:56,420
So went on another four years.

935
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:59,240
So powered by Game Boy and four AA batteries.

936
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,240
So very nice.

937
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,240
Cool.

938
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,660
I thought that was a very nice story from our discord.

939
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:08,040
So let me get to some tweets.

940
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,200
Going to some tweets.

941
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:15,520
I opened up the Twitter earlier this week at OLR and I like four or five times asked

942
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,880
for stories and we got two.

943
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:17,880
We got two tweets.

944
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,240
So I'm a little bit sad that more people aren't tweeting us, but to be fair, I should probably

945
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,680
be more active on the Twitter if I want more people to engage.

946
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,840
So I will try to get better at that.

947
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,200
In the meantime, we will read these tweets that we got.

948
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:34,200
So our first tweet tonight from Garth the Wolf, who tweets us, have you guys checked

949
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,800
out Nier Automata yet?

950
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,960
It's legitimately one of the best games I've played and probably my favorite of this past

951
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:41,960
generation.

952
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,740
It also has a killer soundtrack and story.

953
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:46,240
Please check it out if you get the chance.

954
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,600
Has anyone played Nier Automata?

955
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,960
It's been on my wish list for a while, but it's been on my list and I haven't got to.

956
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,960
You know what's sad?

957
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,920
I've played the first Nier, a little bit of it, but I still haven't played Nier Automata.

958
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,320
But and I don't know if you know about this.

959
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,980
That's the game where if you eat a fish you'll die.

960
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:08,100
In Final Fantasy 14, the raids right now, the new 24 man raids are all inspired by because

961
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:11,640
they're co-created by the guy behind Nier Automata.

962
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:16,000
So this current raid, the 24 man raid, and I've been running this raid quite a few times.

963
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,040
It's called the Copied Factory and it's inspired by Nier.

964
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:23,600
So a lot of the monster design, because it doesn't look like Final Fantasy when you're

965
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,600
in there.

966
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:30,120
It's all big, these gigantic mech robots and things, and the last guy's in a tank and it's

967
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,440
like Transformers and shit.

968
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,040
He transforms into a plane that starts gunning you on the ground and stuff, but it's really

969
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,040
cool.

970
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,440
But the music is some of the best music in the game.

971
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:45,280
And I don't know if they lifted it from Nier or if they had, who's the guy who does all

972
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,280
the music?

973
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,640
The guy, I can't remember his name in the moment, but the guy who does all the music

974
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,640
in Final Fantasy 14?

975
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,640
Sakurai?

976
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,640
Sakurai, yeah.

977
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:57,280
I don't know if they had him do all that, but yeah.

978
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,640
I love the music in there.

979
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,640
It's some of the best.

980
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,640
So, all right.

981
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,120
I'll have to put that on the list.

982
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:09,720
Anyway, let's go to Dark Tetsuya who says, I've been playing Contra Rogue Core and I

983
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,560
have to say it's not nearly as bad as people are saying it is.

984
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:17,280
Incidentally, on the subject of the Konami code, it does appear in the game, but really

985
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,240
only to obtain one of the game's various medals.

986
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,480
Still a neat nod to it.

987
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,480
Oh, so that's kind of cute.

988
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:27,040
So you put in the Konami code and it's like, sorry, you don't get shit, but this achievement

989
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,040
is nothing.

990
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,300
Yeah, but I've watched gameplay of that and it looks really terrible.

991
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:36,480
Like I get it, it's not as terrible as you thought it is, but it's still pretty terrible.

992
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,580
I'm not playing it.

993
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:43,520
I was really excited for it too, but then I saw the gameplay and I'm like, no, no, there's

994
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,480
no, that's not, that's not Contra.

995
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,480
I'm sorry.

996
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,480
Well, okay.

997
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:51,360
But has there ever been a game, and I asked this for Dark Soccer or, you know, anyone

998
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:54,400
out there really, cause I know we still have a chat room going tonight.

999
00:54:54,400 --> 00:55:01,360
Has there been a game where like everybody just shit on the game, but you like the game,

1000
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,360
dammit.

1001
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,680
Like it's not as bad as everybody says it is.

1002
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,760
For me, okay, I'm gonna tell you what game for me that is.

1003
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:13,640
Friday the 13th on the original NES, because I think that game, at least when I was a kid

1004
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:18,000
legit scared the hell out of me and I thought it was a really good soundtrack and I thought

1005
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,360
it was really hard.

1006
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,880
I remember being a total flop at the game, but then I see all this stuff later about

1007
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,160
how like, oh, it's the worst NES game ever made.

1008
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,160
No, it's not.

1009
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,160
It's not the worst.

1010
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,560
There are far worse games on the NES.

1011
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,560
So that's like one of mine.

1012
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:36,820
Are there any like games that everybody shit on, but you're like, it's not that bad.

1013
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:37,820
And it's Soken.

1014
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:44,380
I'm like Sakurai is the guy that made Smash Brothers, that's not his name, Soken.

1015
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:49,620
I don't know off the top of my head, I mean, I'm sure I've liked some really bad games

1016
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:56,740
out there, but I can't think of, I liked Abadox for a while, I mean, but that wasn't really

1017
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:57,860
that bad of a game.

1018
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:00,940
I know.

1019
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:04,780
There was a hot minute where my brothers and I were super obsessed with playing the terrible

1020
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:13,700
Home Alone game on SNES and I did enjoy Blastress with the Super Scope, but Blastress was fun.

1021
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:16,780
There's not like too many really bad games.

1022
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:21,020
There was something really novel about the fact that the Super Nintendo, it didn't just

1023
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:24,060
have a light gun, it had a fucking bazooka.

1024
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:29,060
Like talk about one of the most bad ass peripherals that a company has ever put out, like Justice

1025
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,060
for the Super Scope.

1026
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:31,060
That thing was awesome.

1027
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:32,060
It's pretty good.

1028
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:33,060
I know.

1029
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,060
I miss, I miss the bazooka.

1030
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:35,340
We need that.

1031
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:36,340
We need a bazooka game.

1032
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:39,980
Hey, YYR.

1033
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,460
He's not manufacturing peripherals.

1034
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:42,740
No, no, no, we need it.

1035
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:47,580
We need a sharpshooter mode because this, buy sharpshooter on Steam.

1036
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:48,580
There's your plug.

1037
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:49,580
Okay.

1038
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:52,820
But we need a mode that supports a bazooka.

1039
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:53,820
I'm sorry.

1040
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:54,820
He's not supporting that.

1041
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:55,820
No, I know.

1042
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:56,820
He, what?

1043
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:59,060
He, he doesn't just exist to make all of our wishes come true.

1044
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:03,380
You can, you can just have to, you'll have to rig it yourself using some sort of like,

1045
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:08,900
I don't know what sort of jank peripheral would connect the Super Scope to a computer

1046
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:09,900
and then do it that way.

1047
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:10,900
It's gotta be out there.

1048
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:18,340
They do have controller converters, so it wouldn't be too hard.

1049
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,340
Yeah.

1050
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:21,660
It's just a matter of being able to read the screen and all that.

1051
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:23,540
Which you probably can't do.

1052
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,540
Yeah.

1053
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:25,540
All right.

1054
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:26,540
Yeah.

1055
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:28,020
Because like light guns don't even work on new TVs.

1056
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:33,260
But I'm sure that by some magic and a raspberry pie shoved into a Super Scope, you probably

1057
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:34,260
could make it work.

1058
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:35,260
There we go.

1059
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,260
Now we're talking.

1060
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:37,260
Now we're talking.

1061
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:38,260
All right.

1062
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,460
Anyhow, uh, that's, that's it for the listener round table for tonight.

1063
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:45,780
You can always tweet us more, uh, at OLR if you want to send us a tweet or excuse me,

1064
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:47,060
you can always send us an email as well.

1065
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:48,060
Cause I don't think we haven't.

1066
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:49,400
I like the excite truck.

1067
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:54,780
That's not necessarily a highly, I don't think anyone hated that game, but I, I really liked

1068
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:55,780
that game.

1069
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:56,780
I did.

1070
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:58,100
You liked it more than most people did.

1071
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,100
Yes.

1072
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:03,020
It was an awesome game in which we'll never be a sequel for, you know,

1073
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,340
or all there was, but that was absolute garbage.

1074
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:08,680
Like what the hell were you thinking?

1075
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:12,460
Make a sandwich in the middle of the goddamn race, throw a pie at a clown.

1076
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,460
What the fuck is that?

1077
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,580
That's not a racing game.

1078
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:17,100
The whole fact that they kind of like took excite bike.

1079
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:21,380
I mean, and like it was one of those things, like I didn't even get it until like the game

1080
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:23,380
was already out and I've been playing it for a couple of weeks.

1081
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:27,740
I was like, Oh, excite bike excite truck.

1082
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:32,700
Oh, it's not really at all the same, but it's because they're not, they're not at all.

1083
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:37,020
Aside from like maybe the turbo mechanic was kind of similar, but then that was about where

1084
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,020
it ended.

1085
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:45,940
Um, but you know, then excite bots just went off the fucking rails and on the rails too,

1086
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,820
because there was rail sliding in that game for God knows what reason.

1087
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:49,820
All right.

1088
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:54,060
Anyway, if you want to email us, participate at orange line trader.com or if you want to

1089
00:58:54,060 --> 00:59:00,220
tweet us at O L R let's take a trip down memory lane and visit the classic game of the week.

1090
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:03,940
So every week, dark soccer likes to step into the, into the gaming vault and find a game

1091
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:08,300
that she says, Hey, you should, you should put this in your house and play it.

1092
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:09,300
Good luck.

1093
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:13,900
I mean, you'd have to have a pretty big house for this, uh, for the folks on Twitch.

1094
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:17,780
I do not have video footage of this tonight just because we had to put this show together

1095
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:18,780
very fast.

1096
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:22,180
Um, but this is, this is an interesting pick anyway.

1097
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:23,780
I feel like it's not something that would work.

1098
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:28,100
I think this video half peripheral of the month, we're going back to that.

1099
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:31,420
It's the nausea game for me too, because I used to get really motion sick with this,

1100
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:32,420
but it's Radice.

1101
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:33,420
It's metal as fuck.

1102
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:34,420
Yeah.

1103
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:37,220
Dan, this was like his whole reason for ever wanting to go to Dave and busters.

1104
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:38,220
Yep.

1105
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:41,540
And so Bobby Blackwell is going to perk up cause I know he's a fan of this too.

1106
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:44,620
So I picked a battle tech centers.

1107
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:48,860
It's basically virtual environment venues.

1108
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:57,120
So you have these pods, uh, fully enclosed cockpits that have, uh, multiple screens inside

1109
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,520
rudder pedals, joysticks.

1110
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:05,640
I would be, I wouldn't be surprised if this was the inspiration for, um, great.

1111
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:11,040
Now I don't remember the English name techa, X-Box mecha game.

1112
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:17,440
Um, I remember the, with the $200 accessory, it was like mech warrior mech.

1113
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,440
No it wasn't mech warrior.

1114
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,920
I know what you're thinking of.

1115
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:20,920
It's a steel battalion.

1116
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:21,920
Steel battalion.

1117
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:22,920
Thank you.

1118
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:28,840
Um, but any, anyway, um, I wouldn't be surprised if this was an inspiration for it.

1119
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:34,880
So at any rate, um, it, it could be found all over, um, you, you actually can still

1120
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:40,320
find them in some places in the U S but the first battle tech center opened in Chicago

1121
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:46,560
in 1990 there was another one in Yokohama in August, 1992 Tokyo, 1993.

1122
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:54,000
Um, and eventually 26 facilities opened up that had, you know, more elaborate operations.

1123
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,560
The locations were called virtual world.

1124
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,880
We had one in the middle of like, I don't even remember what it was called, but it was

1125
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:04,240
like some sort of like super bar that was like multiple bars and you had to walk through

1126
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,440
the bar to get to the virtual world thing.

1127
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:10,040
So that was always weird because I heard you like bars.

1128
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,040
It was, it was weird.

1129
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,060
Like I don't remember what it was called, but it was like, they have like seven bars

1130
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:17,140
all attached to each other and it was the strangest thing.

1131
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:19,220
But virtual world was right in the middle for some reason.

1132
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:25,560
Well, at any rate, um, it consisted of 16 networked pods, um, that partially designed

1133
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,100
by frog design.

1134
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:31,860
Um, and it was highly interactive and really fun.

1135
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:36,940
Um, it actually was even in a discovery channel documentary called beyond 2000.

1136
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:42,460
Um, you could compete against players and other centers across the country.

1137
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:49,260
Um, they actually had another non battle tech game included called red planet that had,

1138
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:53,140
it was racing through mining tunnels on, on Mars using hovercrafts.

1139
01:01:53,140 --> 01:02:00,620
Um, but then of course as, um, you know, our, you know, arcade games advanced, you know,

1140
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:05,980
by 2000 there were no more operational battle tech centers in Japan.

1141
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:13,940
Um, in 1996 virtual world and, uh, FASA entertainment technologies merged, um, and became a wholly

1142
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:19,620
owned subsidiaries of virtual world entertainment group and then Microsoft bottom.

1143
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:26,860
So, um, they, uh, wanted to, they actually integrated, um, a lot of that into the Microsoft

1144
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:28,980
game studio division.

1145
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:34,840
And then all of the interest in virtual worlds entertainment was sold to some other guy and

1146
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,400
their offices went to Kalamazoo.

1147
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,160
Yeah, it was kind of funny.

1148
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:44,280
Um, but anyway, um, as it literally went to Kalamazoo, it's not just a, no, seriously,

1149
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,720
the office made from Chicago to Kalamazoo.

1150
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:52,920
Um, so there was, um, the virtual world Tesla two cockpits.

1151
01:02:52,920 --> 01:03:00,440
Um, they opened, um, in November, 2005 with eight Tesla two, uh, uh, pods and then they

1152
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,080
added another four.

1153
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:06,280
And so now they do the, uh, battle tech invitational with 12 pods.

1154
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,800
I mean, it's kind of evolved since then.

1155
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:16,560
And sometimes, um, like there is a company called mech jock LLC, uh, we fit the existed

1156
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:22,840
Tesla two pods so that they could bring those battle tech centers to a different, uh, conventions.

1157
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,960
So they brought it to gen con 2007.

1158
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:30,960
Uh, it's been brought to, uh, comic Palooza, Oni Con, mecha con and dragon con.

1159
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:31,960
Do you've seen it at dragon?

1160
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:35,920
It is there every year at dragon con, but it's one of those staples.

1161
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:40,280
Like if it ever disappeared, like even though I've never done it in all the years that I've

1162
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,900
always walked by and go, Oh cool, I remember those.

1163
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,080
And there's always a group that's there playing it.

1164
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,580
But, um, and all the years I've been to dragon con, I've never done it.

1165
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:51,720
But like, if it left, I would be like, how could they get rid of that?

1166
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,880
Like, you know, you know how that is, right?

1167
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:54,880
Oh yeah.

1168
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,840
Oh, other cons that, um, it's, uh, is going to be at or has been at, there'll also be

1169
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:07,320
gen con origins, ASIN and Yomakon, um, in 2006, some players in Japan bought four Tesla

1170
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:11,720
pods from the U S and put together a virtual world center in Tokyo.

1171
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:14,560
Um, what year was that again?

1172
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,560
Uh, 2006.

1173
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:16,560
Oh.

1174
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:22,680
And, um, but the pods are semi operational, even though they had no way to, uh, really

1175
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:23,680
repair them.

1176
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,120
They can't get the parts for them anymore.

1177
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:30,240
Um, June, 2012, Mr. Biggs family center closed and their assets were auctioned off, including

1178
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,080
their 12 pods.

1179
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:38,520
Um, and, uh, now someone owns 12 pods.

1180
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:45,200
So he removed, he removed his assets and put them into storage.

1181
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:52,520
Um, 2011, along with a, uh, along with a pallet of unopened game boys in 2007, the airlock

1182
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:58,280
in Kirkland, Washington, um, close with eight Tesla simulators transferred and the Washington

1183
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:05,580
secretary of state, um, uh, yeah, there's like a show called better than life says that

1184
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:06,580
it's inactive.

1185
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:09,320
Some of this doesn't make sense as how it's put on here.

1186
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:15,120
Um, there were eight pods in 2011 that were listed on Facebook, um, for, uh, at two private

1187
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,120
home arcades.

1188
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:23,720
Um, 2017 virtual world entertainment read, launch its website at mech jock.com, um, stating

1189
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:29,400
that they're developing cockpits again and have updated software featuring 5.07 D to

1190
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,840
be played in Houston, grand Rapids and Minneapolis.

1191
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:39,220
Yeah, those are pretty dated by 2018, a battle tech center and game store, big kids in grand

1192
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:42,920
Rapids, Michigan, permanently closed pod tracker list.

1193
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:47,560
These pods as being private and in control of the owner of the store.

1194
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:54,480
So of the remaining ones, we have the fallout shelter arcade in twin cities, Minnesota met

1195
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:59,720
core entertainment LLC in Houston, Texas and hanger 51 in Montreal.

1196
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:07,920
So fallout has 12 met core has 18 and hanger has 10 and so, um, the last one I saw was

1197
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:17,720
our Dave and busters in, um, Milpitas at the mall cause we would do my birthday every

1198
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:18,720
year.

1199
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:19,720
There'd be that.

1200
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:22,000
And there'd be Derby owners club and then I would be really drunk and go, ah, Derby

1201
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,040
owners club club is still, it's still there.

1202
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:28,080
I think it's, Oh my God, it's been a while.

1203
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,080
It's been a while.

1204
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,720
Where are those all go?

1205
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,480
Like seriously, like they're where all the horses go.

1206
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:36,840
Oh no, there's one in San Francisco.

1207
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:43,120
Um, cause when I went with JD to Dave and busters out further past, like closer to diamond,

1208
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,120
where was it?

1209
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:45,560
Diamond heights out that way further out.

1210
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:46,560
Okay.

1211
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:47,560
Yeah.

1212
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:50,240
But anyway, um, but we played over there.

1213
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:53,780
Um, I mean it was occupied and I didn't have my horses.

1214
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:55,560
I do still have my horses.

1215
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:57,560
Do you still have politics?

1216
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:58,560
Oh God.

1217
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:06,680
No, I, they, I threw them in the garbage, like the game in the, I still have Panda half.

1218
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:10,640
I will say, because I know Bobby Black Wolf is probably shouting, he's probably shouting

1219
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:15,200
in chat right now that he wants had an interview all about this game and what it's become with

1220
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,640
the, you know, all these years later with the dragon con pods and all that.

1221
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:22,800
So, um, I, I don't know what episode number off the top of my head, but I'm sure he will,

1222
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,480
he will provide a link, but it was, it was a good interview and it's, if you want to

1223
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:28,680
know more about this game and how it evolved in the state of it currently check it out.

1224
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:33,160
There's a little bit more cause there was a battle tech animated series that was done

1225
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:42,320
in that universe produced by Saban, but yeah, apparently there's also books and mech warriors,

1226
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:45,040
I guess kind of related in the same series.

1227
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:53,160
So that also means then that the battle tech stuff is exactly what I was playing in tabletop.

1228
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,160
So cool.

1229
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,160
There you go.

1230
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,160
All right.

1231
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:00,440
Again, get an eight player pre-owned Derby owners club for only $26,000 Oh, is that all

1232
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:11,160
that's all and like a whole room or two of your house dark Sakura, do you need a bedroom?

1233
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:13,960
Which do you want more a bedroom or a Derby owners club machine?

1234
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:22,400
Do you realize my bed takes up one whole room, all the crap in my office, two computers,

1235
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:26,360
a TV, a bunch of video game stuff and all my crafting supplies.

1236
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:30,920
And then our game room, our legit game room that I probably could have put it in is taken

1237
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:33,200
up by three pinball tables.

1238
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:36,980
And we've got five more in the garage and four in the house.

1239
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:40,120
She is not like, like, like this is not hyperbole.

1240
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,600
This is, this is real.

1241
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,260
Like I've been to this house.

1242
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:44,260
They really are.

1243
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:45,260
They have a room full of fucking people.

1244
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:49,140
And one of the ones that my house isn't even mine, which you need to come play before it

1245
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:50,140
gets reclaimed.

1246
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:51,520
Cause it scared Steph.

1247
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,680
Well, I'm going to be gone for a little bit, but do you think Sega would Sue me if I made

1248
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:58,240
a game called Derpy owners club, Derpy owners club.

1249
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:03,320
As long as it's full on parody, they can't under the rules of pair as long as it's parody.

1250
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:08,400
I'll consider that table that now another Loki game got derailed because he had got

1251
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,400
a better idea.

1252
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:13,440
Derpy hooves is a copyright of Derpycon.

1253
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:14,440
Not Derpy.

1254
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:17,280
We'll just do all sorts of Derpy shit.

1255
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:18,280
Okay.

1256
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,280
All right.

1257
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,520
Will you finish this one?

1258
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,040
Oh yeah, of course.

1259
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,480
He'll, he'll finish it more than he's finished any of the others.

1260
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,000
No, I'm not going to start a new game.

1261
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,280
I just thought that'd be a funny idea.

1262
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:34,200
I have lots of really dumb ideas for games that like are just floating around out there

1263
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,200
that haven't made yet.

1264
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,960
Why don't we do that as a bonus episode?

1265
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:40,840
Loki tells us about all his dumb ideas for games.

1266
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:43,400
Give us one, give us one.

1267
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:48,360
It would be like Pokemon go, but with roadkill and you would actually have to get like, so

1268
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:53,860
it's not necessarily roadkill per se, but you'd be capturing animals that are just ordinary

1269
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:54,860
animals.

1270
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:58,340
So it's, it's not like, um, you know, like Pikachu and stuff.

1271
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:01,700
It's like a squirrel, but we'd be calling them different things like trash pandas and

1272
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:02,700
stuff like that.

1273
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:05,540
And then you would level up your characters, um, in the game.

1274
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:09,760
Like they have the little internet comics for a while where like they had like, uh,

1275
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:14,100
it was like hamster fighting or whatever and they taped like knives to them and stuff like

1276
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:15,100
that.

1277
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:18,420
So it would be like that.

1278
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:22,940
And also I thought about a total adult version of like animal crossing, but like, you know,

1279
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:24,900
where you're selling crack and stuff like that on the street.

1280
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:31,140
I think a lot of people have that, but the roadkill, but it's literally like, not really

1281
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:35,380
rogue actual roadkill, but it wouldn't be like actual roadkill would be like hamsters

1282
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:36,380
with claws.

1283
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:41,380
It would just be like, you know, like, Oh, I encountered an animal or like a monster,

1284
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:44,260
but it's just like, it's just an animal called something different.

1285
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:45,260
You know?

1286
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:46,260
Yes.

1287
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:47,260
Yes.

1288
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:52,580
Like danger noodles would be stuff like that.

1289
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:55,980
But it would be done in like a hillbilly, like trailer park aesthetic.

1290
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:56,980
Okay.

1291
01:10:56,980 --> 01:10:57,980
Okay.

1292
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:58,980
That makes it better.

1293
01:10:58,980 --> 01:10:59,980
Yes.

1294
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:00,980
There it is.

1295
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:02,980
Your classic game of the week.

1296
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:11,660
All right, anyway, uh, moving on, uh, let's travel around the world and check out some

1297
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:12,660
release dates.

1298
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:17,260
So we're going to try to cover kind of a long period here through, uh, our next live show

1299
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:18,260
on the 15th.

1300
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:19,260
All right.

1301
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:27,420
So, um, we've got, uh, grand blue fantasy versus on PlayStation four IB and OB on Nintendo

1302
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:34,660
switch murder by numbers on Nintendo switch and PC, uh, Pokemon mystery dungeon rescue

1303
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:42,260
team DX on Nintendo switch, uh, Langrisser one and two on PC, Nintendo switch and PlayStation

1304
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:43,260
four.

1305
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:52,580
Um, let's see Orian, the will of the wisps on PC and Xbox one dead or school by on PlayStation

1306
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:59,980
four, my hero one just, or one's justice to that's on PC, Nintendo switch PlayStation

1307
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:02,480
four and Xbox one.

1308
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,940
And last but not least Neo two on PlayStation four.

1309
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:06,940
All right.

1310
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:08,560
Heading over to Japan.

1311
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:14,280
Let's check out switch releases for March 6th, which include a Pokemon Fushigi no dungeon.

1312
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,360
That is obviously their version of mystery dungeon.

1313
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:19,140
So that is out in Japan as well on the sixth.

1314
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:21,000
And then also coming out in Japan.

1315
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,320
Um, I think that's actually the only release on that particular day.

1316
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:33,840
So jumping ahead to March the 12th, we have a human resource machine, deluxe toe our way.

1317
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:39,240
Uh, no Palm refrain and color cross malice for Nintendo switch.

1318
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:46,160
I guess that's, um, probably some type of, uh, uh, anime or, or manga or something.

1319
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:50,920
Uh, but speaking of, if you're into the horsey games, winning post nine 2020 is also out

1320
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:53,080
on the switch, uh, on March 12th.

1321
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:54,540
So you have that to look forward to.

1322
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:57,680
So if you're, if you're missing your Derby owners club, you always have winning post

1323
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:02,680
to look forward to, uh, checking out the PlayStation four to see what the big releases are there.

1324
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:04,760
You know, I don't see anything that early, early March.

1325
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:08,260
I don't really start seeing releases till March 12th where winning post nine is also

1326
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:09,760
out on the PlayStation four.

1327
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,320
Um, Kondagawa jet girls is out as well.

1328
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:18,200
And uh, some price reductions on far cry, new Dawn, the crew too, and assassin's creed

1329
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:21,880
odyssey as they move into Japan's equivalent of like best hits.

1330
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:22,880
Okay.

1331
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:23,880
How about Europe?

1332
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:28,840
Um, in Europe, well, we're starting just with the beginning of March, right?

1333
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,840
Cause sure.

1334
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:30,840
Yeah.

1335
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:31,840
Yeah.

1336
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:38,200
Cause there's a bunch on the 27th, but yeah, anyway, but that already happened.

1337
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:39,200
Yeah, sure.

1338
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,200
It did.

1339
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:45,880
So on the fifth we have Carly and the Reaper man, which sounds like a fun game, uh, escape

1340
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:46,880
from the underworld.

1341
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:53,360
Um, also on the fifth we have Pokemon mysterious dungeon rescue team DX Ori and the will of

1342
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:58,560

Um, also doctor who the edge of time for PlayStation hell warders, um, on the 12th, my hero one

1344
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,480

1345
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:18,480
That's uh, from the, my hero academia, um, uh, Neil, uh, two on, uh, March, uh, 12th.

1346
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:22,400
And on the 16th we have remnant from the ashes.

1347
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:27,000
I might've gone too far, but I don't care.

1348
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
All right.

1349
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:33,840
I might add the week after we do our next show, animal crossing will become, I know

1350
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:34,840
it's almost here.

1351
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:35,840
It's exciting.

1352
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:36,840
Mm hmm.

1353
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:37,840
Exciting stuff.

1354
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:38,840
Three weeks away.

1355
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:39,840
I needs.

1356
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:40,840
All right.

1357
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:44,560
Well, uh, that's about going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio, but

1358
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:45,560
here's here.

1359
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:50,800
So I was just texted this by a friend of mine, apparently, uh, the first us coronavirus case

1360
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:55,680
of unknown origin just confirmed in Northern California.

1361
01:14:55,680 --> 01:15:00,280
And I guess it's the individual is a resident of Solano County and is receiving medical

1362
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:01,440
care in Sacramento County.

1363
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,480
I thought there was the one that came back from Japan.

1364
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:04,480
Yeah.

1365
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:08,960
There's a Korean lady now going around Southern California in Korea town that turned out she

1366
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:09,960
is infected.

1367
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:10,960
Huh?

1368
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,880
The individual had no known exposure to the virus through travel or close contact with

1369
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:14,880
a known infected individual.

1370
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,800
Oh, but it's like I said, they already confirmed that it was airborne.

1371
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:19,800
Yeah.

1372
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:20,800
So fun.

1373
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:24,440
Well, I hope they in contact with Corona's.

1374
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:25,440
I blame that.

1375
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,240
I hope I get to go on my cruise.

1376
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:28,240
All right.

1377
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:33,800
So, so that means that I am going to go buy some more lysine and do things that boost

1378
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,120
up my immune system.

1379
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:40,000
But the people I'm more worried for are my friends who are immunocompromised, you know,

1380
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:46,160
my friend's child, a couple of friends of mine dealing with AIDS and HIV, elderly individuals,

1381
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:47,160
elderly.

1382
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:48,160
Yeah.

1383
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:51,640
Um, just do the things that will boost your immune system.

1384
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:58,280
Don't be stupid, but do the things that are, just be intelligent about it.

1385
01:15:58,280 --> 01:15:59,280
Yeah.

1386
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,200
Take, take normal precautions.

1387
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:06,640
Don't go around with a gas mask, you know, if you are immunocompromised, it might not

1388
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:13,680
be beyond the scope of reason to have maybe a, an N5 or N95.

1389
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:21,600
But again, be smart and learn how to fucking wash your goddamn hands the right way.

1390
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,200
Not just a little water.

1391
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:33,120
You have to scrub your hands and get in your nails and up at least past your wrist bone

1392
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,640
to be considered having properly washed your hands.

1393
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:38,920
And you sing happy birthday twice.

1394
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:39,920
Yes.

1395
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:40,920
All right.

1396
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:46,800
So, and, and, and what do not touch blood or bodily fluid?

1397
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:53,340
I'm just saying because, well, it's just, oh, I'm probably going to be renewing my first

1398
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:55,800
aid cert in the light of all this.

1399
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:56,800
So.

1400
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:57,800
All right.

1401
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:02,120
Well, to practice good hygiene, everybody, uh, we're going to wrap up final thoughts.

1402
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:05,480
Uh, thank you guys for tuning into this special episode of orange launch radio.

1403
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:08,560
Um, especially since, you know, we're, I'm out of town for a couple of weeks.

1404
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,440
Uh, we are planning to be back on March 15th.

1405
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:11,840
I guess I have to phrase it that way.

1406
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:16,240
Now we're planning to be back on March 15th, um, live over at vognetwork.com.

1407
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:20,360
So we really hope to see you guys then, uh, but otherwise it's time to wrap things up.

1408
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:21,360
We're done here for the week.

1409
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:24,720
So, um, if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange on radio, please tell a friend or

1410
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:25,720
two about the show.

1411
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:28,080
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has voice, but if the

1412
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:31,080
voices aren't here to put out on air, then what are we going to do?

1413
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:39,760
So, um, also very important to say, uh, that, um, uh, uh, sharing the show, uh, hosting

1414
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,440
on Twitch, all of that stuff goes a long way.

1415
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:45,880
We'll have a very, uh, long episode probably on March 15th to catch up on everything we

1416
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:49,240
missed because I'm sure there's going to be a lot between GDC and packs and everything

1417
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:50,240
else.

1418
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:51,240
Uh, it's going to be something.

1419
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:54,400
I hope you guys will still be checking out Bobby Black Wolf and other independent podcasts

1420
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:58,400
on not just at vognetwork.com, but all up and down the wonderful interwebs.

1421
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,080
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1422
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,080
Dark Sakura.

1423
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:04,160
Um, I don't know.

1424
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:06,680
My brain is mushy.

1425
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:07,680
It's mushy.

1426
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:12,320
My appropriate final thought for tonight would be live long and prosper.

1427
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,120
Loki, your final thought.

1428
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:19,800
Uh, my final thought is that, um, I don't know.

1429
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:20,800
I don't have anything.

1430
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:21,800
I'm tired.

1431
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:22,800
That's it.

1432
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:28,000
On that note, rest up, play some games, make your, make your, uh, some more Minecraft cause

1433
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
that's mindless.

1434
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,560
Ooh, actually I was literally about to hit the credits button.

1435
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:33,560
Dark Sakura.

1436
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:34,920
