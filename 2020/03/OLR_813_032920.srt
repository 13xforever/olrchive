00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Nearly three decades later the game with no conversation dialogue

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The original quarter eater Dragon Slayer is going from movie video game to video game movie

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm hoping for a space age successor

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is just one story, join us for the rest starting right now on the show where every gamer has some space

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 813 of our program for March the 29th of 2020

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
My name is Rob Roberts and as we talked a little bit about last week

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And as I'm sure you're well aware with everything going on in the world

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I am all alone in the studio this week as we are practicing social distancing

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Which is a pretty good idea in the state of the world today

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Pretty good thing to be practicing

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Not joining us at all tonight though sadly DarkSakura or Jamie Summers

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Talked to her yesterday a little bit via text because her voice is not holding out so well

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
She was having kind of a rough night last night so she decided to bow out of tonight's show

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Just to let her voice recover a little bit

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Completely understand if you've been listening to the last couple weeks

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
She's been battling something kind of nasty

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We don't know what it is because is it the big one? Don't know because testing is not there for it

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But regardless we're wishing her well

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I did check in with her about an hour ago

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
She said she was doing a lot better today but still wanted to rest her voice for the night

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Which is certainly understandable

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Who knows she might pop in to our chat room at some point throughout the night

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
vog network dot com that's vog network dot com or on twitch twitch dot tv slash vog network is where we tape

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Every Sunday night at 6 o'clock pacific 9 o'clock eastern ish right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Even though DarkSakura is not here tonight I am joined via discord by tech master Loki

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Hello Loki

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Hello I'm here

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You are here how are you how are you holding up after how many days is it that you've been in the house now

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
For me it's coming up on 14 days tomorrow

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Um yeah because I was working from home as a week from last Monday so yeah it's been two weeks

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah so yeah pretty much the same so well glad you're hanging in there

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Hopefully a chance to play some games and maybe get caught up on writing your own game

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Um I would have let no I've had time no time to do either of those

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And the reason for that is I've been dealing with PC issues

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And so I my laptop does not want to cooperate with two monitors I have

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And so it's it keeps crashing I've been just dealing with that all week

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And so because it clearly is not working and I think the graphics card may be going out on it

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It works fine by itself so I got a replacement coming

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
All right well glad you at least have a replacement coming hope it makes a decent amount of time

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Because I know they're prioritizing the essential stuff right now so it's

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Oh no it'll be here like tomorrow

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Well that's good that's good I'm looking at some of the chat room comments over at twitch.tv slash vog network

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Where fifth dream today is saying the mouse is looking at me plushplosion

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay so those that are watching live on twitch have the visual

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And I haven't plugged this in a while so I should say if you are a subscriber on twitch at vog network

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Which you can use your if you're an amazon prime person you get you may not know this but you get one free twitch subscription every month

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So if you want to use that on vog network you get access to our video archives

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The podcast audio version is free just as it has been for over 18 years

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Or not quite over 18 years over 17 years coming up on 18 years like I'm getting at that point where I forgot my own age

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But anyway the point is is if you're watching the visual whether it be live or via your twitch subscription for vog network

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You can actually see see usually it would be myself and it would be loki on camera

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
DarkSakura sometimes on camera when she feels like it because you know it's her choice if she wants to get on camera or not

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But without loki here I'm a little lonely so some of the various plushies that I have

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That actually Alan freaking won some of these on that crane site

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Torreba I think is the name of it I don't know what it is it's one of those freaking crane game sites

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I shouldn't even give it a plug because he wasted so much time on that site and they're not paying me any money

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But he did win this little hamster thing in that master ball looking thing but captain pikachu and I go way back

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I've had this life-sized pikachu for a long time so I have to have something to fill in for loki when he's not here

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Maybe next week I'll get some round table breadsticks those will remind me of loki

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Maybe we'll see

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It might be a few weeks that we're on this system of doing OLR

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I think it's important that we continue to do OLR to the best of our ability

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But the reality is we're not exactly going to defy the governor's order

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So once that is lifted and changed then we'll consider getting back together again

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Which if what we just heard earlier today in the national news is any guideline it's going to be at least till the end of April

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But you know gotta keep people healthy gotta make sure we squash this thing flatten the curve

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Try not to spread it around to people that don't need to have it myself included

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So yeah we're just doing what we have to do

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That didn't stop my neighbors from having their motorcycle party earlier today

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What is up with that? We've been having neighbors that have been having parties too and I'm like you guys are missing the point

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You're just gonna you're ruining it for everybody. It's horrible

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Maybe they watched Tiger King and decided to bring their well I wouldn't even say it's their inner redneck because it's kind of their whole persona

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But you know amp that up a bit

79
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Have you been getting obsessed with Tiger King?

80
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That is all everybody is fucking talking about on Twitch

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's Animal Crossing and Tiger King

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm surprised the two haven't come together yet

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I have watched the whole thing though

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Of course you have

85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It seems like the type of thing your wife would be into

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And she was, yes

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Of course she was

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
No I've held off on Tiger King thus far

89
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I am finally trying to finish Love is Blind

90
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So I'm a few like and that was the big thing everybody was watching in February on Netflix

91
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So I'm a little bit behind

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So what is that? Is that because I sort of remember a show that was on the soup or something

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Where they have like people in like a dark room talking to each other and they weren't able to see each other

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Is that that show?

95
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah but the soup has been off TV for years

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Love is Blind is a newer show

97
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But they can only, they're in these like pod things and they can only talk to each other and they can't see each other

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And then, but it's weird because like the first three episodes are that

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And then the rest of it is, haha now let's see if it works

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Or if they become a hot mess and surprise

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Some of them are total hot messes when they get together in person

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I mean I'm sure we're all shocked at the type of people that go on those sort of dating reality shows

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That you put some, you mix them up in a room and there's drama, surprise right?

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Alright anyway, let's get into actual video game chat

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I mean we could sit here and talk Netflix

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I mean I guess we could talk about like Castlevania, Ingress anime

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Or there's that other Netflix thing I bet is on y'all's mind

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes it's in the news, we'll get to that a little later

110
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But first while we get to tonight's kickoff topic

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Loki, what are we starting off with tonight?

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So they have the Nintendo Direct, or surprise Nintendo Direct I guess

113
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:41,000
That was earlier this week talking about some indie games and some other like additions to current Nintendo games

114
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So for example they talked about their progress in Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition

115
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
They announced that some 2K games are going to be coming to the Switch

116
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Including the Biostock Collection and Borderlands

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Those are going to be coming

118
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I think that's, oh wait just real quick

119
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I think that's great about Borderlands and Bioshock

120
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But I don't know, this seems to be like the Switch's MO or something

121
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
How old are these games at this point?

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And it's just now getting to Nintendo's console

123
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's not a read, it's not a dis, I understand

124
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
There's some people out there that are going to be very excited with the portability of a game like Bioshock

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But I don't know, I feel like those are games that are better experienced on a big TV

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Which yes I know the Switch can do, but you know the high end graphics and all that stuff

127
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I don't know, I feel like those are little scraps that the Nintendo fans are getting tossed

128
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Don't get me wrong, I love my Switch, I'm super jazzed about other stuff that was in there

129
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Maybe it's just one of those not for me dot com type of things

130
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's probably just pretty easy to port that stuff over I guess

131
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I guess, maybe, just maybe the engine they're built in or whatever

132
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It doesn't take a lot of man hours to port that over to Switch

133
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't know, I just always feel like those are kind of scraps

134
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And then they have the XCOM 2 collection as well

135
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So that was something that was announced there

136
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Burnout Paradise Remastered was another game that's supposed to be coming to the Switch as well

137
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And then some of the other things they talked about

138
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
There's the final piece of DLC for Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3, so it's a fantastic 4

139
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
They talked a little bit about Animal Crossing New Horizons

140
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's going to have their seasonal event Bunny Day

141
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Which that bunny is super creepy

142
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But that's going to be taking place

143
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Too bad it wasn't the bunny from Silent Hill

144
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It pretty much is

145
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Can you do the reskins maybe?

146
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Can you design the bunny an outfit and make the bunny wear Silent Hill costumes?

147
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I don't know, but Zipper is looking pretty creepy

148
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I mean, think about how fucking crazy business Animal Crossing is doing right now

149
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Animal Crossing is probably bigger than it's ever been

150
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And it's because in large part of what's going on in the world

151
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We don't have our real lives to talk about

152
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So what are we talking about on social media?

153
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Our fake ones in Animal Crossing

154
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I think this game would have done fine as it is in a normal world

155
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But now especially that we're all shut in

156
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And we can't go out and fish for real

157
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Or go out and do things out in nature for real

158
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
We're all sharing it through Animal Crossing

159
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I don't know about y'all's social media

160
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But my social media is filled with Animal Crossing stuff

161
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And I just feel like

162
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And the reason why I say all that is that this game and this franchise has never been hotter

163
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
In my opinion, with what's going on in pop culture and stuff

164
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
This just seems like the time for Nintendo to really let us tweak it even more

165
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Let us design some of our villagers

166
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I would love to have villagers that imitate Pyramid Head and stuff

167
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But maybe that is exactly what Nintendo does not want to open the flood gate to

168
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
If you could draw your own patterns for the villagers

169
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I guess you could always give them shirts and things

170
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But I feel like if you could totally reskin the villagers

171
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Somebody's gonna do Nudzu

172
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Somebody's gonna do Nudyzu

173
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And it's gonna get awkward

174
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I saw someone

175
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Then you're gonna have Tiger King

176
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Then you're gonna fucking have Tiger King

177
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Well I saw somebody though actually on Twitter

178
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And I want to say it might have been Mayor Marvel

179
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But I thought it was

180
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
They did a dress that had a butt on the back of it

181
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Oh yes, oh my god I saw that

182
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Somebody had a dress pattern

183
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But they drew a butt on it

184
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So it just looked like the person's butt was hanging out of the back of the dress

185
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That was great, I love it

186
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yes, it already happened

187
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Oh you creative people

188
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Oh and through the QR code and generate your own pattern sites

189
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Anyway, people are putting all sorts of filthy things

190
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But funny things too

191
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Like I found online a shocked Pikachu painting that I have now

192
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I have an N7 logo up

193
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
What else do I have?

194
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I have

195
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Oh a friend of mine sent me Rocky Horror Picture Show related ones

196
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So now I have a throne scene with Frank N. Furter and friends all up there

197
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Okay

198
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yeah so it's just all this crazy stuff you can get with QR codes

199
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So aside from the Bunny D event which of course they're gonna be hiding eggs

200
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And they have special crafting things

201
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
There are some other games that they are talking about

202
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
One called Good Job

203
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It looked pretty cool

204
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And then some new

205
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
They're gonna have a demo for Bravely Default 2

206
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
As well as they're saying that Star Wars Jedi Knight Jedi Academy

207
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And the Panzer Dragoon remake

208
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Those are all announced as well

209
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And then the Bravely

210
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
No I was gonna say the Bravely Default 2 demo came out with the day of the Nintendo Direct

211
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So I didn't get around to playing it but some friends of mine played it

212
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm hearing kind of mixed reviews on it

213
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Some people are really into it

214
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You know those that probably really enjoyed the first Bravely Default

215
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm hearing a lot of criticism about some of the character design

216
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And some of the voice acting

217
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I guess there's one character in particular

218
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's like please stop

219
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Please stop this now

220
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So don't know we'll see how it goes

221
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Okay so and then we also had Clubhouse Games

222
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
51 Worldwide Classics

223
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That's been announced

224
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That's coming on the Switch on June 5th

225
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I wanna just say I wanted that freaking franchise to make a comeback

226
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yeah

227
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Well I was so

228
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And then oddly enough

229
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Games that no one ever asked to be ported to the Switch

230
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Star Wars Episode 1 Racer

231
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's coming to the Switch

232
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Why?

233
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Because the pod racing was the only thing cool about that

234
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I don't know maybe it's another one of those like

235
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It was fairly simple to port so we did it

236
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I guess porting games is the new shovelware

237
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Perhaps

238
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Anyways and then of course

239
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
New Fighter announced for the Smash Ultimate DLC

240
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And that new fighter is Arms

241
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Now I don't know if that's all of the different characters in Arms or just

242
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
One of the characters

243
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You're kind of half right

244
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
They just announced that the next character

245
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Would be from Arms

246
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
But they didn't say who it would be

247
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And I know a lot of people are hoping for Twintelle

248
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Just because she was a kind of standout character from Arms

249
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
But the thing about Twintelle

250
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And the reason why I don't think it's going to be her

251
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Is that Twintelle actually uses her hair

252
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Not her arms

253
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Like she's the one with the big braids

254
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So I don't know if she'll end up being the character or not

255
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I don't really play Arms

256
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I've tried to play it a little bit

257
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And I'm going to be honest

258
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I didn't care for it

259
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So I kind of wonder why Nintendo is trying to make Arms happen now

260
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Because they did that

261
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
They're doing the free play weekend or whatever

262
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Okay

263
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But I guess other people were into it

264
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Sure, but I wasn't a big Arms fan

265
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So I'm kind of meh on this news

266
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yeah, I remember they were trying to position

267
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
As like an eSports title

268
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Almost

269
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That was kind of the trend there

270
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Where everyone wanted to be an eSports title

271
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And it just wasn't going to happen

272
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yeah

273
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
No, it didn't happen

274
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Maybe eSports has

275
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Got a new focus on it now

276
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Because of this whole stay at home stuff

277
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And how it's affecting

278
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Some of the programming on television and stuff

279
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But that seems a little too

280
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Like I don't think Nintendo

281
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Is putting Arms in Smash

282
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Because suddenly due to Coronavirus

283
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
They sense a rise in eSports

284
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That is too calculated

285
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And would have taken more time to plan

286
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Than the reality of this situation

287
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
No, I don't think that's at all

288
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm just saying

289
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I don't think eSports even around Arms is ever going to happen

290
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But

291
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I was going to say the last bit of news

292
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
In addition to

293
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Ring Fit Adventure

294
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
They're getting an update which adds a new rhythm game mode

295
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
They have songs from Super Mario Odyssey

296
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Splatoon 2 and Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild

297
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Which is pretty cool

298
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Man, if only we could get some pop songs in there too

299
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Like that would be great

300
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I have not played that mode yet

301
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I've seen some tweets from people who've been playing it

302
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And I've watched some of the YouTubes and stuff

303
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So it kind of looks like

304
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Just instead of the notes falling

305
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
From the top down

306
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
They kind of come in more of a

307
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Well shaped thing

308
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Like Guitar Hero

309
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Because I guess we learned all those years ago

310
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
That Konami actually has the patent

311
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
On the notes falling from the top

312
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Of the screen down

313
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So that's why all the music games now do it

314
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Where it's coming at you

315
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Because Konami doesn't have the patent on that

316
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That patent has run out already

317
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I don't know

318
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
But for whatever reason

319
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Nintendo is doing it where it's coming out at you

320
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And you can see the motions with the controller

321
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
With the ring controller

322
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Like it might squeeze on a certain bit

323
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Or you might kind of tilt it left or right

324
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
At a certain point

325
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And that is all dictated by when the notes

326
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Get to the front

327
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It looked interesting

328
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I want to try it

329
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It probably shows

330
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I haven't really played Ring Fit

331
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Since quarantine started

332
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But I have been snacking

333
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I probably should be playing Ring Fit

334
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Some folks in chat talking about

335
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Arms

336
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
AJ Twist is asking

337
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Isn't there an Arms character that is a trophy in Smash already

338
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I do believe you are correct

339
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And they're talking about Spring Man

340
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Act F says I totally forgot the name is the armed guy

341
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
AJ Twist says Spring Man

342
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Yeah I think they're kind of like

343
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Mascot guy that's like on the box

344
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I believe he is some type of assist

345
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Trophy already in Smash

346
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Not that

347
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Assist trophies and the like

348
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It has stopped characters from becoming

349
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Full blown characters before

350
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I feel like

351
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
There was something that got upgraded

352
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Along the way but

353
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It escapes me in the moment

354
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Man what are we getting Geno? Seriously

355
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Well you've got four

356
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Four more

357
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Characters after this one

358
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
So you never know what might happen

359
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Bobby Black Wolf says it has stopped Waluigi

360
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Hey never say never

361
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Until that tenth character is announced

362
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Not that I want to give false hope but

363
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I don't know I feel like they

364
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Weren't originally planning to do a

365
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Second set of DLC I feel like

366
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And now they're doing it so they've had enough time

367
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
To hear the fan feedback and they might do it

368
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Who knows but I think

369
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
If Waluigi does happen it will be the very

370
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Very last one

371
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Act F says Little Mac was an assist trophy

372
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
In Brawl before he became a full character in

373
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Smash 4 yes I knew there was like one

374
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
That like got upgraded but I guess that

375
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Wouldn't have really been within the same game

376
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So was that everything

377
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
From the Nintendo Direct Loki?

378
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Yeah pretty much So what did you think overall

379
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Of the Direct and what you

380
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I mean if you didn't watch it the highlights I guess

381
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I didn't really watch it

382
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I mean

383
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I don't know

384
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's alright there wasn't really anything

385
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That was super exciting about

386
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Unfortunately I'm not a huge fan of Clubhouse games

387
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm sure it's a great game

388
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Don't really care that

389
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Bioshock Infinite and all that says to be important to

390
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The other system I have it on green systems already

391
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So it's like eh I don't really

392
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Need it

393
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I don't know

394
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
There's nothing super exciting coming out of that

395
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Unfortunately

396
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Well it was a mini so you know it wasn't

397
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Like I guess I don't know what the difference is

398
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It was still 30 minutes they could have just called

399
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It a regular Direct and it probably would have been fine

400
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
For me the Xenoblade stuff

401
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
That remake looks hot

402
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm definitely going to buy that when it comes out

403
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
They definitely kind of took a deep dive into that

404
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
A little bit because I don't know if we'll get

405
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Maybe there will be a special Direct

406
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I guess before June there ought to be another Direct

407
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Of sorts so they'll probably show even more on that game

408
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
But I'm definitely going to pick that up when it comes out

409
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And otherwise

410
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah like the 2K games are a little bit like

411
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Okay I already kind of have like all of the

412
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Things I want on Playstation already

413
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But I guess cool for the Nintendo exclusive folks

414
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Or some folks are saying in chat

415
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
If you really want to play it in a portable setting

416
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Which isn't for me

417
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But maybe it's for you so cool

418
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And then some of the

419
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Clubhouse games obviously I'm a very big fan of

420
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
So those were some nice little surprises

421
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It wasn't like an oh my god

422
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Type of thing but it was some nice surprises

423
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Nice little treats

424
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Especially when there's a lot of shit news in the world right now

425
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It was kind of nice to have something a little bit like

426
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Oh I have this to look forward to that's a nice thing

427
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says

428
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I hope they just did a mini

429
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Just to shut up all the Twitter trolls

430
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
That beg for a Nintendo Direct every time

431
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Well I don't think they did it just for that reason

432
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
But clearly Nintendo had a few things

433
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
That they just wanted to like drop on people

434
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Because what they put out that Bravely Default 2 demo

435
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
They put out Panzer Dragoon

436
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Came out day and date

437
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
They started taking your money

438
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
For clubhouse games

439
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So they kind of had a backlog

440
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Maybe a small backlog of things

441
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
They just kind of wanted to get out there

442
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And make sure people knew about

443
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
So I think it kind of served its purpose in that regard

444
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So

445
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
AgDef says if it was a big Direct

446
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
There would be like a big announcement

447
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And they probably would have given you more time too

448
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
They probably would have said we'll do one tomorrow

449
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Instead of

450
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Did they say later did they drop one the same day

451
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Or did they give you a days notice

452
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I don't remember

453
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Yeah

454
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So those are some of the comments from our chat room

455
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Oh interesting AJ Twist says

456
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Maybe it was called a mini Direct

457
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Because there was no human host

458
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That's an interesting thought as well

459
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Is that they didn't

460
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Yeah they didn't have anybody

461
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
From Nintendo either Japan

462
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Or America or anyone really

463
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Talking us through the different announcements

464
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So that is a very very good point

465
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Maybe that's one of the differences between

466
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
A mini and a regular Direct

467
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And perhaps in this era of social distancing

468
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Where many Nintendo people

469
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Are working from home

470
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Maybe they weren't able to get all the footage they needed in time

471
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Although you know many of these Directs

472
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
They filmed that stuff way in advance

473
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So you know

474
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
The world has changed very fast

475
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
In the scope of two to three weeks

476
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And I would bet they already knew what was going in this Direct

477
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Like a month ago

478
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
For the most part they knew this Direct at least a month ago

479
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
If not even further back

480
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I would bet

481
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
E3's Direct or I'm using my quotey fingers

482
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
E3's Direct

483
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
The inevitable June Direct

484
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
That Nintendo I guess can drop at any point they want to now

485
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
That Direct

486
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
They probably already at least have their outline

487
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Of what's gonna be in that

488
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And they're probably starting to script that out

489
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And then they'll shoot that bit by bit

490
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
That will have live talking faces with that

491
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
So

492
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Anyway, alright so Nintendo Direct

493
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
A nice pleasant surprise from Nintendo this week

494
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
So let's talk a little bit about the types of games

495
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
That we have been playing this week

496
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Since Dark Soccer is not here tonight

497
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
We'll start with you Loki, how was your gaming week?

498
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I didn't play much of anything

499
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Aside from

500
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Just

501
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Forna

502
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Because I've been trying to fix my computer

503
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So

504
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Didn't get around too much

505
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I have started working on

506
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Putting StepMania in the DDR cabinet

507
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Because we have been using it a bit more

508
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I just haven't really been playing too much

509
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
But like literally right now

510
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I have the PC for that cabinet

511
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
On my desk here

512
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I've been copying songs over

513
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Probably should

514
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I need to get everything loaded in

515
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So that I can test it

516
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
But it's almost

517
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Probably pretty close to being ready to go

518
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I just need to mount the PC onto

519
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Like a board or something

520
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So I can set it in there

521
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Figure out how to wire it up

522
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So I can switch between the PC

523
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And the

524
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Actual System 573 board

525
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
That's in there

526
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Yeah I was gonna say I saw on Twitter

527
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Or Facebook or something I saw a video

528
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Of a Dance Dance Revolution machine you have in your garage

529
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So did that kind of awaken

530
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
The I want to do something else with this

531
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Machine sort of part within you

532
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Well I just had

533
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
A lot of time where I wasn't able to

534
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Work on stuff or we

535
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Didn't have to go anywhere so I had a lot of time to

536
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Kind of

537
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Put all that together and earlier

538
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
We got redownloading packs and everything

539
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And then I finally found all the

540
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Download packs that I had and I was like

541
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Oh man

542
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I just have to

543
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
What I'm doing now is I'm kind of setting it up to test it

544
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I was originally wanting to make my own

545
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Theme and everything for it

546
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
But I think I'm gonna put that on the back burner for now

547
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Until I just want to get it

548
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Running and get it going and then

549
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I'll do themes and all that stuff

550
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Later but I have to sort out

551
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
How I want to sort all of the songs

552
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
That are in there

553
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I think I want to kind of do it more like extreme

554
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Where has it kind of by

555
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Mix that's come out and then

556
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Of course

557
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I think A.C.E. might be the

558
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Dance System Revolution A

559
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I think they have it

560
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Organized somewhat similar

561
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I want to do it like that

562
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Probably the theme I'm going with

563
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Is it's a fan made theme

564
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Called Supernova 3

565
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
It kind of looks like the old

566
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Supernova or even like

567
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Extreme setups with the song wheel

568
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And everything

569
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
It seems to be pretty lightweight

570
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I'll probably do that

571
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Cause I mean it should be pretty fast

572
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I think I had originally tested it with the

573
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
A.C.E. theme on there

574
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
But we'll see

575
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
When I end up doing mine it'll be much fancier

576
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And probably a little bit more unique

577
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Ok alright adventures in Loki's

578
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
DDR machine

579
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
So for my gaming week so I've been playing

580
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
A lot cause you know video games help pass

581
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
The time sadly for discussion

582
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Purposes I've been playing a lot of the same things

583
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I usually play like continuing to play Final Fantasy

584
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
14 games like that

585
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And MMO's are a great like social

586
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Thing right now and you can't really like go outside and be

587
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Social so I think that's why I tend to

588
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Sink a lot of hours into something like Final Fantasy 14

589
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Been trying to play the

590
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
GPS games on those rare occasions

591
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I go out and walk like obviously

592
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You know I can't really go out and do anything too crazy

593
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
But like last night we

594
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Drove to a restaurant to get pickup food

595
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And I was like Alan can you drive

596
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So I can play Orna while you drive

597
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
So he agreed to do that

598
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
So that was kind of nice so I was able to get some GPS gaming

599
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
In there and I do a little bit on my walks

600
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
As well but haven't been doing anything too

601
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Crazy with that for obvious reasons

602
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Still continuing on Diablo 3 as well

603
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I did make sure to play

604
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
A new game this week because

605
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Since I do have

606
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
All this time and I have

607
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Xbox Game Pass along with

608
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Many other ways to play a variety of

609
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Different games such as like the free games they give

610
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
On the Epic Store you know

611
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And giveaways here and there and everywhere

612
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
There's no shortage of games in the backlog

613
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
To play so one of the games I decided to

614
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Check out this week which is on

615
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Xbox Game Pass although apparently it's

616
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Going away soon because it does say it's

617
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Like a limited amount of time left so

618
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I don't know if I just started this game in time for it to

619
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Leave at the beginning of the month I don't know

620
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
But it's a game called Kingsway

621
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So what this game is

622
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
It's like an RPG

623
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
But the RPG it's like a

624
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Classic you know swords and sorcery

625
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Type of RPG like a Final Fantasy

626
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
English thing but it's

627
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Framed around

628
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
An operating system

629
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And it looks like an

630
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Old operating system like a

631
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Windows 3.1 operating system

632
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
From like 1994

633
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Or something where you

634
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Like double click on the world map

635
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Window to bring up the map

636
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And as you click where to go

637
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You see your little character move and a little progress bar

638
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And you can hear like it really emulates

639
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Like a little disk drive going

640
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Making the little noises the disk drives would do

641
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And then like different windows will pop up

642
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Like if you run into a monster a window will pop up

643
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And you have to like fight it and so you

644
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Do your inventory management through

645
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Windows so it's really

646
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Clever how they

647
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Kind of built this concept of

648
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
We're going to do an RPG but it's going to be based

649
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Within an operating system so it's

650
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Like Windows the RPG but it's

651
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Kind of clever and I

652
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Think people who probably grew up

653
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Around that era like I think of

654
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Somebody like Bobby Blackwolf and I know

655
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
He's a big fan of these types of old

656
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
MS-DOS games back in the day

657
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I think he would really get a kick out of this game

658
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
But I'm not sure a lot of

659
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Folks like let's say

660
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
By the time you were born

661
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Uh you know modern

662
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
PCs and Windows XP and all that

663
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Stuff was already kind of the norm by the time you

664
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Were a child I don't know if there's

665
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Going to be as much here for you because it's not

666
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Going to be the same type of nostalgia trip

667
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
But I think the nostalgia trip for

668
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Gamers of a certain age is kind of

669
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Fun so it's one of those games that's worth

670
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Checking out especially if you have Xbox

671
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Game Pass anyway

672
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I don't think it's on Xbox

673
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It wouldn't make sense why it would be on Xbox

674
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
The console because obviously it's very mouse

675
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Driven so it's the type of thing that strikes me as

676
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Very like a PC thing so if you have it

677
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
You might as well check it out if

678
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
You can it might be leaving

679
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Game Pass very very soon

680
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I believe so

681
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says

682
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
If it's in the leaving soon

683
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Area of Game Pass then it goes away on the

684
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
31st well I guess I'm glad I played

685
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
It when I could I've been eyeing

686
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It says Bobby I remember seeing

687
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It all the PR for it from adult

688
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Swim games yeah it's published by them

689
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
As shown under Matt says

690
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Yeah I could play at home too I just need to get out

691
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Move around being inside is

692
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Maddening I know oh that's a response to something

693
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
It was Act F was saying in chat

694
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Yeah it's

695
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
You got to find that right balance of

696
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Going outside I haven't been going outside enough

697
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Quite frankly but I kind of get sick

698
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Of the same old walk like since

699
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I live like right and without giving away my

700
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Address here on the program

701
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Since I live right in the heart of

702
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Suburbia it's like within walking

703
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Distance is a park

704
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And if I want to walk a really

705
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Long distance I could get to a couple other parks

706
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
But that's a

707
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Long and it's like it's like a commitment

708
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It's like if I walk all the way to one of the other parks

709
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Then I got to walk back so

710
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I mean I guess I could get in the car and drive

711
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Somewhere but then you get into all these problems

712
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Of well if you drive to the

713
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Park that everyone wants to go to

714
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Then it's too crowded and it defeats

715
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
The purpose that was a problem they were having

716
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
With the beaches and stuff right

717
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So you got to find that right balance it's tricky

718
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
But luckily thanks to things like

719
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Pokemon Go and Ingress

720
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And the other GPS things I've played over the years

721
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I have a pretty good sense of

722
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Where all the big parks are in town

723
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
That don't get too crowded

724
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
So I guess that part is kind of nice

725
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
So that's good

726
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And there's always like the river

727
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I have been tempted to go down

728
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
To Capitol Park do you think they'd throw people

729
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Out of Capitol Park I don't think they would

730
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
It's still very wide open you can keep your space

731
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
From people there as long as it's not swarming with people

732
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
But I don't know like I don't want to be

733
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
That person you know

734
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
That's setting a bad example so

735
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Or just putting myself at risk quite frankly

736
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
But yeah I miss those really

737
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Dense Pokemon places like Capitol Park

738
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Would be fun so

739
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Anyway well that's enough for my gaming week

740
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
So a lot of the same old stuff but I'm trying

741
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
To squeeze in at least one new game a week

742
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
While I'm here at home catching up

743
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
On the backlog a little bit I already know what game

744
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I want to play for next week except

745
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I forgot the name of it but it was another game

746
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
On Xbox Game Pass that totally looked like

747
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
It looks like it's Devil's Crush or Alien's Crush

748
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Or something like that like it's another pinball game

749
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And I think it's even called like Demon something

750
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Somebody in chat will yell it out I'm sure

751
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
But that is the game I wanted to get around to it this week

752
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
But I didn't get to it so that's the game I definitely

753
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Want to check out for next week so

754
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
That game looks really cool so

755
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Alright

756
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
See a Tiberian chat talking about

757
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
The beaches stuff

758
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It's interesting how the social game

759
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Swarm what Foursquare originally

760
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Was is now not

761
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Awarding as many points if you're going outside

762
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Of a home area and when you choose

763
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
To do something that's not like a housing

764
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Development it pops up and says

765
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Stay home that's kind of an interesting use

766
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Of some of those GPS things

767
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
It is interesting seeing how a lot of those things have had to

768
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Adapt things like Pokemon Go

769
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Have kind of had to change how the game works

770
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
A little bit

771
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
To get beyond Minecraft Earth

772
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Did something similar I heard this week

773
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Have you checked that out?

774
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I heard Minecraft Earth did something

775
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Yeah so they did this thing

776
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I checked it out for a second and I saw

777
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
It's turning very much into

778
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
A regular mobile game

779
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
So what they added is

780
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
These runes that basically

781
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
If you play Minecraft Earth

782
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
So part of the game is just collecting

783
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
The tappables that are on the screen to get

784
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
All the blocks which really if you

785
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Just drive around you're going to have a ton

786
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Of stuff

787
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So they have it like

788
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Parks there's these things called adventures

789
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Where you can get additional blocks

790
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And you also get experience

791
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And other things

792
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Then they have this AR interactive

793
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Thing that you do so

794
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
What these runes do is they

795
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Cause you to spawn and adventure

796
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Like

797
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Wherever you're at

798
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
So they give you one for free

799
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
To be able to spawn one of those

800
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Adventures

801
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
It's only the taste that's free

802
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And then after that you got paid for it

803
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Use your rubies

804
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Or whatever they're in the game

805
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
But you earn those pretty quick

806
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I didn't see where I could actually spend those

807
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
To do that

808
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And ever since I haven't played the game

809
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
In a long time so now it's just like

810
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Full of like different

811
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
XP boosts and different

812
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Food boosts and HP boosts

813
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And I'm like oh my god

814
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
This is way too

815
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Just like demanding of

816
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Your money it's just like come on

817
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Pay pay pay pay

818
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
That kind of really turns me off from playing that game

819
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
S2100 Matt says

820
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Demons Tilt was the name of the game I was trying to think of

821
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Yes that is it you got it

822
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Interesting S2100 Matt says

823
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Waze yells at you when you open it up asking if you really

824
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Need to be outside right now really

825
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Because I've been a good boy

826
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And following all the rules I haven't seen all the apps

827
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Doing these things so that's very

828
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
That's really interesting

829
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Interesting how these apps have had to adapt

830
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Let's just hope it doesn't go on

831
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Forever and you know

832
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
If we happen to have some folks

833
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
That are working

834
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
In the healthcare industry and really on the

835
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Front lines of what's going on right now

836
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Thank you for what you guys are doing

837
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I know it really can't be fun right now

838
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
So thank you so much

839
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Hell grocery store employees

840
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
And Costco employees that really

841
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Can't be fun either right now so

842
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
A big thanks to everybody that's

843
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Really stepping up in this time

844
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Of I can't believe

845
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
It's actually happening this

846
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Alright anyhow let's move on

847
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Back to video games and traveling

848
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Around the globe

849
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Checking out the latest and greatest in gaming news

850
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Because while folks are still working

851
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
From home and while the world is getting used to

852
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
What's going on right now there is still

853
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
More gaming news

854
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Such as Loki starting us off

855
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Kind of a follow up

856
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
To something from last week kind of sort of right

857
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Yeah so we talked a little bit last week

858
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
About how GameStop is considering them

859
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
An essential

860
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Retailer and

861
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
That they need to stay open during this whole

862
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Corona outbreak thing

863
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
However they're not the only

864
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Game company to have done that

865
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
So there's another retailer by the name of

866
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Game Exchange

867
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Let's make sure we're hating on everybody appropriately

868
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Let's make sure we've

869
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Saved enough of our internet rage for other

870
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Asshole companies

871
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Yeah so they're looking mostly like Texas

872
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Arkansas like the southern east

873
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Or southeast of the US

874
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
And apparently

875
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
They have done something

876
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Similar so they're doing the curbside

877
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Pick up options as well

878
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
But

879
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
There's not really

880
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
The precautions being taken

881
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
They've basically said that

882
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Yes they're an essential retailer

883
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And that they're providing

884
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Them with

885
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Sanitizing products and stuff like that

886
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
But much like the whole GameStop thing

887
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
That's not necessarily

888
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Being available

889
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And it's not necessarily happening

890
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Like they're describing

891
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
So some of the employees are very frustrated with that

892
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Basically saying that they don't want us to

893
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Close at all

894
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
If any employee chooses not to work

895
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Then they're told that they will not be paid

896
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Since they are not working

897
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
This even goes for salary managers as well

898
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
And then of course they're saying

899
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
We've got the order to shelter

900
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
In place today from the county judge

901
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I hope that the higher ups would do the right thing

902
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And not put up a fight

903
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
And put their employees at health risk

904
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
But it appears that they have no interest

905
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
In closing the doors as the pandemic has progressed

906
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Corporate has declined

907
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
To stop practicing

908
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Stopping the practice of accepting

909
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Trades

910
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Our location is located right next door to a medical clinic

911
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
That takes walk-ins

912
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
In a time where there's a global pandemic

913
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Keeping the specific location

914
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Open next door to a place where there are patients

915
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
With illness is madness

916
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Funny enough actually

917
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
So along with this

918
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I saw a follow-up talking about

919
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
The GameStop practices

920
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
And what they're instructing their employees to do

921
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
As far as

922
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
That delivering to the doorway

923
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Type thing

924
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So they're literally telling them to

925
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Take

926
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
A GameStop plastic retail bag

927
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And just put that around their hand

928
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
As a glove

929
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
To be able to hand games

930
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
And payment methods

931
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Back and forth to people

932
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
It's ridiculous

933
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
You really

934
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Shouldn't be exchanging things like

935
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Credit cards and money right now

936
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Unless it's at a truly essential business

937
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Like a grocery store

938
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Even then

939
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Now is the time to check out Apple Pay

940
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Or Google Pay

941
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
The contact type transactions

942
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Tap to transact type thing

943
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Yeah exactly

944
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
It's ridiculous

945
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Apparently

946
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
They feel that they need to

947
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Do this in order to stay open

948
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I don't know if it's necessarily just

949
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Capitalizing on it or the fact that

950
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
A lot of these independent retailers

951
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Even though this is a pretty sizable one

952
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Aren't doing that well

953
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
If you can think about GameStop struggling

954
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
And they have direct relationships

955
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
With all of these publishers

956
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Game companies or retailers

957
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Like Game Exchange

958
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
They have to purchase their distribution

959
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I know because we used to sell to them

960
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
So

961
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
They have it even worse than GameStop

962
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
As far as being able to get product

963
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
On time

964
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
The cost keeping that low

965
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And having these special incentives

966
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
To get people to come into their store

967
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So that's even harder for them

968
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
And if GameStop's

969
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Literally running

970
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Their business to the ground

971
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
In fact I think they're closing another 300 locations soon

972
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Then

973
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
It's just gonna

974
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Hit them even harder

975
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Still shouldn't put employees in danger

976
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Because of that, that's ridiculous

977
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
But it's

978
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
A very complex situation

979
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
That really they should be sending those employees home

980
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Especially since GameStop did that now

981
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
To a certain extent

982
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
If you're thinking of the profits

983
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Before the employees

984
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Then obviously you're a problem

985
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And also

986
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
What's the pay cut

987
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And I say this every time

988
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Or the CEO

989
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
We never hear the talk about that

990
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Well actually I will say

991
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
In non-gaming related things

992
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
We are starting to see that more and more

993
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Like I think we're seeing those articles around social media

994
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
That there are some companies

995
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
And of course now that I need to recall them in the moment

996
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I can't think of who

997
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
But there are some companies that are

998
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Like the CEO, I was reading one about some CEO

999
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
That was dropping his pay to 10,000

1000
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
This year

1001
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
To try to use the extra money

1002
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
To make sure they're taken care of and so forth

1003
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And yes, good job

1004
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
That is what CEOs should be

1005
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
A $10,000 salary

1006
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Heck, he could take maybe a little more

1007
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
A reasonable salary is fine

1008
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
But use that extra money

1009
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
When you're the type of CEO that's making millions

1010
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
To give back to your employees

1011
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I think that is

1012
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
All we would like to see somebody do

1013
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says

1014
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Devil's advocate

1015
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
What if they're not necessarily thinking of the profits

1016
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
They're just thinking about staying operational

1017
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
With all

1018
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And that's what I think that they're doing

1019
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Is trying to stay operational

1020
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
But at the same time

1021
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Everybody's thinking about that

1022
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
But you can't put your employees in danger

1023
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
To stay operational

1024
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
You just have to

1025
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Reduce the number of stores you have

1026
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
A responsible upper management team

1027
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Has a plan

1028
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Has a pandemic type of plan

1029
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Or a contingency plan

1030
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I can tell you every company I've worked for

1031
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I haven't worked for a lot of companies

1032
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Because I was with one for 14 years

1033
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
But the companies I did work for

1034
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Always had a plan for

1035
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
What if we get in a situation

1036
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Where all the computers go down

1037
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Or what if we get in a situation

1038
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
And I distinctly remember

1039
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
The first company I worked for for 14 years

1040
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Which was a major health insurer

1041
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Because of the fact they were a health care insurer

1042
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And people are going to want to use health care

1043
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
They had specifically a pandemic plan

1044
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Granted I haven't worked there in several years

1045
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
So I have no idea if they've actually

1046
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Enacted that same plan or what

1047
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
But they actually have these types of plans

1048
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
So it is kind of your responsibility

1049
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
As the upper management and the board

1050
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
To be thinking about these types of things

1051
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
You should have had a plan for curbside pickup

1052
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
And all this type of stuff a long time ago

1053
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Now I realize

1054
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
There's infinite combinations

1055
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Of things to plan for

1056
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And not everything's going to be perfect

1057
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
And nobody could have truly predicted this COVID situation

1058
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I do understand all of that

1059
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
But don't you get the sense

1060
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Aren't you kind of feeling like

1061
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Nothing was planned

1062
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Don't you kind of see those two extremes

1063
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
In this scenario

1064
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Yes

1065
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
At the same time I do see that

1066
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And I think it's more

1067
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
They may have been

1068
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Looking at well GameStop doing it

1069
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And we can do it as well

1070
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
And that's a lot of the sentiment

1071
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I used to get with a lot of the independent

1072
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Retailers that I dealt with

1073
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Was if GameStop for example

1074
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Was breaking the street on a title

1075
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Then they feel well it's fine if we do it then

1076
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
So I think

1077
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
That's kind of what they're looking at here

1078
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
They're basically saying that

1079
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Oh

1080
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Well if they're doing it then we can do it

1081
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Alright

1082
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Anyway it's a tricky

1083
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Scenario but I kind of think ultimately

1084
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
The reality of what's going to happen

1085
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
In light of all these

1086
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Stories that are coming out and things

1087
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I think this might be the situation

1088
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
That pushes more people to go digital

1089
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
That hadn't considered it before

1090
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I don't think physical is going away

1091
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I don't think my opinion has really changed on that

1092
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Whatsoever but because

1093
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Just CDs and music

1094
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
That is primarily digital

1095
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
At this point but there are still

1096
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Collectors and collectibles

1097
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
You can still find

1098
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Those CDs and so forth they're not as easy to find

1099
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
As they once were but you can still order them

1100
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I kind of think that is a direction

1101
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
That gaming is kind of headed in

1102
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Eventually and I think this kind of

1103
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Accelerates that a little bit

1104
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Than maybe what we were thinking before

1105
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
We were kind of already thinking

1106
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
That gaming was kind of going that way anyway

1107
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
And I think these two months

1108
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Of people don't really want to go out to the store

1109
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I mean there's this

1110
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
GameStop and GameExchange

1111
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
They got their plans on how to stay open

1112
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
But the reality is

1113
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Speaking for myself

1114
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I'm not going to a fucking game store right now

1115
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Either I'm going to get it on Amazon

1116
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And just wait a few extra days

1117
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
An extra week if I need to

1118
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Because it's something that's not essential

1119
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Or maybe even longer than that because it's a game

1120
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Or I'm just going to buy a digital because

1121
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
You know what that's my other option right now

1122
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
It's not the way I prefer to buy games

1123
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
But if it's something that I have to play

1124
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Right now like Final Fantasy 7 Remake

1125
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Then I'll just buy it digital

1126
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Even though that's not really what I wanted to do

1127
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Anything else can either wait or you know whatever

1128
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
So

1129
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Well yeah and I think a lot of major releases

1130
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Anyways are being pushed back

1131
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Because of this whole situation so

1132
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I don't think there's a whole lot of stuff that we have to

1133
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Jump out and run out to get right now

1134
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Yeah so Lady Gaga pushed

1135
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Back her album so you know that was

1136
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
The thing I'm sure you all were waiting for so

1137
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Now that has been pushed back

1138
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
So yeah I think really

1139
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Like as far as gaming goes I feel like

1140
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
The Final Fantasy 7 Remake was the only

1141
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Big thing I was hearing about for April

1142
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I don't know what April looks like for like triple A titles

1143
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Maybe some of you guys in chat know more

1144
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
But you know I think

1145
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I think it was really we're getting

1146
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I don't think we know a lot of the big stuff

1147
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Yet because we're in a new console year

1148
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
So I feel like we're still waiting on a lot of the big

1149
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Console stuff oh is Last of Us 2

1150
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
An April game

1151
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
That's the other one that's escaping my mind

1152
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Right now was Last of Us 2 an April game

1153
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Or is that like later does he keep pushing that one back

1154
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Um I thought

1155
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I thought that got pushed

1156
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I thought that was a June game

1157
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Ok Act F says May

1158
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I know that I was like what's Playstation got

1159
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Oh yeah lots of difference

1160
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Alright well anyway let's move on

1161
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Let's talk about this story which has to do

1162
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
With kind of a

1163
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Social media trend gaming

1164
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Companies coming together to start this

1165
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Campaign with

1166
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
WHO the World Health Organization

1167
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
So it's kind of interesting to see

1168
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Official government entities that are

1169
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Right in the midst of this whole thing coming together

1170
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
With gaming companies to create

1171
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
This awareness of what they're calling

1172
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Hashtag play a part

1173
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Together and that's kind of a play on the

1174
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Word apart because it's

1175
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Playing games across a distance but

1176
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
You're also playing your part by

1177
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Staying home and not spreading this

1178
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Horrible disease so

1179
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
The World Health Organization

1180
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
And the industry have come together to

1181
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Launch this awareness campaign play a part

1182
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Together it encourages physical distancing

1183
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
With special events, exclusives

1184
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Activities, rewards

1185
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And inspiration for different

1186
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Popular games. Some of the companies

1187
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Participating, Activision Blizzard

1188
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Zynga, one of your favorites I'm sure

1189
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Big Fish Games

1190
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Let's see Kabam

1191
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Pocket Gems, Riot Games is in on this

1192
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Snap, Twitch

1193
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Is actually taking part in this because I think

1194
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Twitch just did their big marathon yesterday right?

1195
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
They had a big thing

1196
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Going on yesterday

1197
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
The city is also in on this too as is

1198
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
YouTube so there's lots of different types of

1199
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Elements of gaming that are in on this

1200
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Trend of

1201
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Hashtag play a part together

1202
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And it's interesting

1203
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Because some journalists are

1204
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Noting the World Health Organization

1205
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Just last year was talking

1206
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
About gaming disorder

1207
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
You know people that play too many

1208
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Video games whereas now

1209
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
It's a little different. A spokesperson

1210
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
The United States ambassador to the

1211
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
World Health Organization Ray Chambers said

1212
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
In a statement that during this

1213
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Time frame of COVID and everything

1214
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
He applauds what's

1215
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Quote the ingenuity of partners from

1216
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
All sectors who are stepping up

1217
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
To assist efforts to combat the

1218
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
COVID-19 pandemic

1219
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
So the World Health Organization is trying to get the global

1220
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Gaming industry to get millions

1221
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
That's another thing to note it's global

1222
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Gaming is global right? Riot Games has a huge

1223
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Presence in Asia

1224
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Many different Asian countries

1225
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Not just China where we know that

1226
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
COVID is kind of I don't want to say it's

1227
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Taking its course but we know that the curve is

1228
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Starting to come down in China but we got all these

1229
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Other countries like I think I'm not sure

1230
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Where Taiwan is at

1231
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Or you know some of these

1232
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Other places Japan I think was just

1233
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Well I don't know if Riot Games and League of Legends

1234
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Is as big there but

1235
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
You know there's just there's other countries

1236
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Where you know these some of these companies have a big

1237
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Presence it's not just the US

1238
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
That needs to work on flattening the curve

1239
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
As this virus is spreading around

1240
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
So

1241
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Also trying to encourage

1242
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Game players and so forth

1243
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
To follow hand hygiene

1244
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
And physical distancing and

1245
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
So forth so it's kind of

1246
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
It's kind of a neat little awareness campaign

1247
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I'm very curious to

1248
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
See what these companies start

1249
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
To do like in games and so forth

1250
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
But because they're talking

1251
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
About like maybe like rewards

1252
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
And things to get people to play games online

1253
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
But we'll see as that

1254
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Develops right now

1255
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
So

1256
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I'm kind of also curious

1257
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
For those of you out there in the chat room

1258
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And Loki maybe you have a piece to say on this too

1259
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
It seems like gaming

1260
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Is just becoming

1261
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
More and more prevalent in these times

1262
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Anyway like I see a

1263
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
A sizable number of people on Facebook

1264
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Starting to stream

1265
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Jackbox games that's a company

1266
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
That's really thriving in light of what's going on

1267
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Like it's weird to talk about

1268
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Like oh your company's doing great

1269
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Because of this horrible situation going on

1270
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
But it is what it is

1271
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Like I feel like so many people are learning

1272
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
About Jackbox games right now

1273
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Because more and more people are playing

1274
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
That on Zoom meetings

1275
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
You know with streamer mode

1276
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
And things like that people are getting together to play

1277
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Jackbox

1278
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Like my cousin who I didn't even think

1279
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Ever played video games was posting

1280
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
About this earlier today trying to get people together

1281
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
To play Drawful or something

1282
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
On a stream and so it really does

1283
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Seem like video games are a great

1284
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Way for people to be and of course Animal Crossing

1285
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
We talked about earlier in the show

1286
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Video games have been a great way for people to

1287
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Still interact even when they're

1288
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Staying at home

1289
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Loki have you kind of noticed an upward trend

1290
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
In social media or have you been invited or seen

1291
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Any of this like online gaming stuff that didn't

1292
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Really exist previously

1293
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I mean obviously we've seen a lot of

1294
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Stories about different

1295
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Boarding

1296
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Entities going to their

1297
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Esports kind of equivalent

1298
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
And doing stuff that way so I think we're going to see

1299
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
A big

1300
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Especially if it takes off you know

1301
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
A lot more popularity with esports

1302
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Because of this whole having to

1303
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Stay away from everybody

1304
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Yeah definitely I mean I've seen

1305
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
A lot more people playing stuff online

1306
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I haven't been invited to do anything but

1307
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
That's fine

1308
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I've just been noticing

1309
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
A lot of people doing that

1310
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
In chat PodCulture says you can play

1311
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Cards Against Humanity online now

1312
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Yeah I got I mean there's all sorts

1313
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Of like Cards Against Humanity like Sims

1314
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
There was one Zizzix it's got a really weird name

1315
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Somebody invited me to play that the other night

1316
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
So I was playing that for a little bit and that was fun

1317
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I had the most points too when I left just saying

1318
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
And then that reminds me

1319
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
That same group has been playing Dungeons and Dragons

1320
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
You want to go old school

1321
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Maybe not so much it's not so much video games

1322
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
But you know tabletop

1323
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Even have their place right now

1324
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
And I know friends that do

1325
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Like a weekly or is it monthly

1326
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
They do like a monthly tabletop gaming meetup

1327
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
And so since they couldn't do that this month

1328
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
They did it online and they were playing like

1329
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Dominion and Catan and those types of things online

1330
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Because there's a lot of sites where you can

1331
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Do that so it's kind of interesting to see

1332
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
How people are playing through that

1333
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Oh and Bobby Blackwolf points out tabletop

1334
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Simulator even works in VR

1335
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
See Bobby we need clubhouse

1336
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Games more than ever see by the time clubhouse

1337
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Games comes out hopefully we're on the other

1338
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
End of this curve and everything and we're

1339
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Talking about getting back to some sort of normalcy

1340
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
We need clubhouse

1341
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Games right now dang it so

1342
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Act Def says the game

1343
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Show games like Wheel of Fortune

1344
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
And Jeopardy and things like that

1345
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Good call good call

1346
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
And SHO 100 Matt talking about you know

1347
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
The increased what are the sports channels

1348
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Doing sports broadcasting networks

1349
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Are starving for contact and they're turning

1350
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Or content excuse me and they're turning to

1351
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Wrestling and sports movies

1352
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Esports time now to get

1353
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
All the eyes on it yeah and

1354
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I feel like Twitch there's just so many more

1355
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
People broadcasting on Twitch all at once now

1356
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Too just because

1357
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
You can't go outside

1358
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Right now so it's just interesting to see

1359
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
How that's all taken off so anyway

1360
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Play a part together

1361
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Interesting awareness campaign for the world

1362
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Well let's move on with some more news Loki

1363
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Yeah speaking of more

1364
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
You know campaigns for

1365
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
The whole

1366
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
COVID-19 situation

1367
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
We have games done quick

1368
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Tackling

1369
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Some relief for COVID-19

1370
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
With their brand new Corona

1371
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Relief done quick

1372
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
It's going to be an event that's going to be online

1373
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Of course from April 17th through the 19th

1374
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
And the

1375
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I'm assuming all durations

1376
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Or all donations are going to direct

1377
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Relief for COVID-19

1378
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
And then of course they're saying that

1379
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
The summer games done quick has been postponed

1380
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
As well it was

1381
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Originally scheduled for June 21st

1382
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
But now it's being pushed back

1383
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
To August 16th instead

1384
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Probably

1385
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
A good idea in light of everything going on

1386
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Yes

1387
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
So

1388
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Yeah be interesting to see

1389
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
You know what

1390
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I want to see what they're going to be running in that

1391
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Yeah and it's going to be interesting to see how that

1392
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Yeah and it's going to be interesting to see how that's going to all be set up

1393
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
With the social distancing as well

1394
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Although I believe that channel

1395
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Has done plenty of speed runs

1396
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
When there's not

1397
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
A hotel convention type of thing going on

1398
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
And they just

1399
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
They do like a remote like they're

1400
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Hosting somebody else's stream essentially

1401
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Or maybe doing it through Skype or Discord

1402
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Video feed or something like that

1403
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
So I'm sure there's plenty of ways to do it

1404
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
So it'll be kind of interesting to see

1405
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
How well received something like that is

1406
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
And it does do very well

1407
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And then of course I'm sure everybody will be

1408
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Very much looking forward to getting back together in person

1409
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
And it's funny because

1410
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Bobby was talking about this a little bit on his show tonight

1411
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Because as many of you know

1412
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
He applied this year to be one of the hosts

1413
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Which is very

1414
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
You know we're rooting for him

1415
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
But if he weren't to get it we would understand

1416
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Because there's tons of people that are

1417
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Applying to be hosts of these things

1418
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
But he was kind of talking a little bit about

1419
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
You know well if they can do this online

1420
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
There's going to be some people that would say

1421
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Well do it online all the time but at the same time

1422
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
It kind of loses something like it's

1423
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
There's something about being all in the same room together

1424
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
You know and hearing the big cheers

1425
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
And things like that and

1426
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I kind of replied to that I was like sounds familiar

1427
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Because it kind of reminds me of like OLR

1428
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Like we're able to do this show over Discord

1429
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
But it's

1430
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
It's more fun when it's in person and we can play off each other

1431
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
A lot easier and the laughter is more contagious

1432
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Than it is over Discord

1433
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
You know so

1434
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Looking forward to being back to normal soon

1435
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
That's for sure

1436
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
And Bobby Blackwell points out

1437
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Games Done Quick they do remote speedruns every week

1438
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
They do entire weekend marathons completely online

1439
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Yeah I figure like I stumbled on one of those marathons once

1440
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
So the

1441
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Corona thing

1442
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
The speedrun they're going to do for

1443
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Corona virus relief

1444
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Efforts and so forth is not going to be

1445
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Probably a technical challenge whatsoever

1446
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Hopefully they can get lots of eyes on that

1447
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I'm sure they'll get support from Twitch though

1448
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Some front page love and things like that

1449
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
And just general awareness on social media

1450
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
And so forth that they'll get some

1451
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Good donations for that

1452
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
And Questbuster talking about what's

1453
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Going on overseas

1454
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
The ESA not to be confused

1455
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
With the E3 people this would be I think it's

1456
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
European speedrunning association I may have got

1457
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
The acronym wrong but essentially that's what it is

1458
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
They just hosted a UK

1459
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Speedrunning event that finished today and they're

1460
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Planning an online only week of runs in April

1461
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
As well so

1462
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
And since you can participate globally why not

1463
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
You can check that out too as well if you want

1464
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
So best of luck to everybody involved

1465
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
With games done quick with the Corona

1466
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Relief efforts

1467
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Let's talk a little more about Animal Crossing

1468
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Since it's what a lot of people are talking about

1469
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Right now but actually what I want to talk

1470
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
About is Animal Crossing Pocket

1471
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Camp yeah that's not the current

1472
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
One the current one is New Horizons

1473
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Pocket camp is the cell phone game

1474
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Remember that one you would think a lot of people

1475
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Have thrown that app in the garbage now that

1476
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
New Horizons has come out but that's

1477
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Yes it's hot garbage

1478
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
But that's actually not the case

1479
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Pocket camp is apparently more popular

1480
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Than ever maybe because

1481
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
With all this talk of

1482
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Animal Crossing on social media

1483
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Not everybody has a switch

1484
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
So maybe some folks are turning to the mobile

1485
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Version to get their fix a little bit

1486
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Apparently players spending on March

1487
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
21st a single day

1488
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Came in at a quarter of a million dollars

1489
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
That was spending in one day

1490
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
That's not bad the game's best day

1491
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Since March 2nd

1492
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
The game has generated approximately

1493
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
3.6 million dollars for the month

1494
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Downloads rose by 150

1495
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Percent and

1496
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
670,000 installs the week

1497
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Of March 16th which is when the

1498
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Shelter in place started for many many people

1499
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
So that's pretty

1500
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Interesting how that game has been getting some

1501
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Speed but I would bet it's all the people

1502
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
That are like what's this about

1503
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
And they don't have a Nintendo switch so they

1504
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
This is their easiest way to check that out

1505
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Is through pocket cap

1506
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Which is a very different Animal Crossing experience

1507
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I wasn't really into it

1508
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
But that's just me DarkSakura loved it

1509
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I was not into it it sounded good on paper

1510
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Animal Crossing on a cell phone

1511
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Sounds awesome and it was garbage

1512
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I didn't care for it but again

1513
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I have other friends that are super into Animal Crossing

1514
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
That love it and I consider myself

1515
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Like an Animal Crossing fan

1516
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
But I just didn't care for this one

1517
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I just prefer the Nintendo console based ones

1518
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
And some folks

1519
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
You know in this

1520
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Interesting day and age of all the different

1521
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Work from home things

1522
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
You got some people that are using Zoom to work from home

1523
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Or maybe something like WebEx

1524
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
To get people together or Adobe Connect

1525
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
There's many many different ways to try to bring

1526
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Co-workers together in this day and age

1527
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Some people are using Animal Crossing

1528
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I think this is maybe meant to be

1529
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
A little more parody and not that serious

1530
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
But there was a

1531
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Japanese company that was posting some of the pros and cons

1532
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Of working remotely through Animal Crossing

1533
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
And the pro

1534
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
No voice chat

1535
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Because they have no network features whatsoever

1536
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Well you can voice chat through the Nintendo app

1537
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Technically

1538
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Technically

1539
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Actually I will give a shout out to the Nintendo app

1540
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
It is proving to be useful for the first time ever

1541
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Well I don't know maybe some folks thought

1542
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Splatoon's tie-ins were pretty good

1543
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
But

1544
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Excuse me

1545
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
For Animal Crossing

1546
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
The fact that you can use the keyboard

1547
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
In the app is very helpful

1548
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
As well as the QR code reader

1549
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
To get different patterns in your

1550
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Town from the internet, that's very useful as well

1551
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
So if you're playing Animal Crossing and you haven't looked at the

1552
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Nintendo app

1553
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
You might have forgot that was a thing

1554
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Get back on that because it is pretty useful

1555
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
But some of the cons

1556
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
The Japanese company says about working from home

1557
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Via Animal Crossing

1558
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Can't send files

1559
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Can't speak about confidential matters

1560
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Meetings are constantly interrupted by talk

1561
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Of Animal Crossing

1562
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
And no one is using their real name

1563
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
You know it's funny because I was in a work meeting

1564
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
The other day and people actually asked

1565
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Like what is something that's making you happy

1566
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
During this time and I actually brought

1567
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Up Animal Crossing and I was like well a new

1568
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Animal Crossing game came out and I really love that

1569
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Game, nobody got it

1570
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Nobody got it

1571
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
That's unfortunate

1572
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
That is unfortunate because I bet a lot of them would really love it

1573
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
If they saw it

1574
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I wasn't going to take the time to explain it

1575
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
At this particular juncture

1576
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
So

1577
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat talking about

1578
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Zoom and Fortnite

1579
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I saw a meme where people were using

1580
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Fortnite and said that the pros over

1581
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Zoom was that it was more stable voice

1582
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Chat and you could shoot your co-worker

1583
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
If they were being annoying

1584
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I like that idea

1585
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
That's very good

1586
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Alright

1587
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
And Bobby also says I was using Zoom for

1588
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Four years I'm a Zoom hipster

1589
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
You know what's so fascinating to me

1590
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
My knowledge

1591
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Of those types of tools

1592
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
From playing Ingress

1593
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Is coming in really handy right now

1594
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Because like when we had the big anomaly

1595
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Here we were doing a lot of planning

1596
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Stuff with Zoom

1597
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
And so that's a tool I've been using

1598
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
For a long time

1599
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Because there were other things that had

1600
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
To do with Ingress and meeting people even before then

1601
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
And

1602
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Slack I've used before

1603
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
And now my company is talking about using

1604
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Slack in this interim while we're working

1605
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
From home and so I'm like

1606
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I've used it I can answer some questions

1607
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Well Slack also is supposed to be

1608
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Integrating with Microsoft Teams as well pretty soon

1609
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
So you can actually

1610
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Call somebody on Slack with

1611
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Microsoft Teams or vice versa

1612
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
We've all jumped on the Microsoft Teams

1613
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
And

1614
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
It's alright

1615
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Slack's okay

1616
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I wouldn't want to see our company use it

1617
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Permanently but it's a nice little like

1618
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Stand in for now while we can't really see each other

1619
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I suppose so

1620
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Anyhow let's

1621
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Move on with some more stories

1622
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Loki

1623
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Yes so this is kind of a random thing

1624
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
They have a brand new

1625
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Kind of advertising campaign for

1626
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Sega now

1627
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
You may remember back in the 90s

1628
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
They had the whole

1629
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Sagata Sanchiro

1630
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Who was their mascot

1631
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
For the Saturn

1632
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Well now

1633
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
For Sega's 60th birthday

1634
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Celebration they have

1635
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
His real life son

1636
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Mito Fujioka

1637
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Playing

1638
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
The same character

1639
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Which is pretty funny

1640
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
So they have this whole thing

1641
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
For Sega's 60th

1642
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Birthday

1643
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
It's great we should get more

1644
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Advertising like this for

1645
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Companies

1646
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
It's very Japanese

1647
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I just generally miss the

1648
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Mascots from all the gaming

1649
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
You know all those commercials in the 90s

1650
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
And maybe early 2000s

1651
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Where like what was the guy that worked

1652
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
For Playstation that was in all the commercials

1653
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
For a while

1654
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Was kind of the mascot

1655
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Yeah I don't remember his name

1656
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
You know obviously Sonic was a bit of a

1657
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Mascot for Sega for a while

1658
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
But that stuff isn't as strong as it used to be

1659
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
You know

1660
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
We need the mascots. Kevin Butler, thank you Act F

1661
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Yes Kevin Butler

1662
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
He was the greatest fictional vice president

1663
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Of Sony ever

1664
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I guess the closest thing we have is

1665
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Flo from Progressive

1666
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
I guess

1667
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
But that's not gaming

1668
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
We need those gaming mascots

1669
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
To come back like that

1670
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Questbuster in chat says

1671
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
The Sagata Sanchiro commercials were great

1672
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
That actor's son is taking up the banner too now

1673
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Well you know sometimes those things

1674
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Kind of stay in the family. I'm thinking of

1675
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
That social media thing that went around

1676
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
With Mel Brooks' kid

1677
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
And then Mel Brooks was actually in the

1678
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Bit too but the kid

1679
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
His kid is in his 40s

1680
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
He's probably older than me

1681
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Was kind of doing a little comedy bit about that whole

1682
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Thing and that was really great

1683
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Isn't his name Max?

1684
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Oh I didn't realize that

1685
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Bobby Blackwell says his kid wrote World War Z

1686
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Really? I didn't know that

1687
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Interesting

1688
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Well let's move on. Let's take a trip down memory lane

1689
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Let's look at those classics

1690
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Shall we? In a segment we call

1691
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
The classic game of the week

1692
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Where every week on the show

1693
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
We like to take a trip down memory lane to visit

1694
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
A classic game. Usually Dark

1695
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Sakura would take this on and step into

1696
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
The gaming vault and find a game that she thinks

1697
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Hey you guys should be checking

1698
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
This game out

1699
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
But she's not here tonight

1700
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
So I'm gonna actually take over for tonight

1701
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
And talk about my classic game choice

1702
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I think this is one you might like too though

1703
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Loki. I'm not sure

1704
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I don't know if this was up your alley but it should be

1705
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
This was actually one of my

1706
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Favorite arcade games from back in the day

1707
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
It is a game called

1708
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Ramparts is the game

1709
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Do you know this game Loki?

1710
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I do but I'm not a fan

1711
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Really? I love this game

1712
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
It's from the year

1713
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
1990 okay

1714
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
It's based on that specific

1715
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Atari arcade hardware

1716
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Games like 720 and stuff were done on

1717
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
I remember

1718
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Was it the Nintendo

1719
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Or Super Nintendo version?

1720
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
They did. There was a Super Nintendo version

1721
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
That used mode 7 if I'm not mistaken

1722
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
And there were two Nintendo versions

1723
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
A lot of people don't know this

1724
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
There was the US version

1725
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I think Jellico did it in the US

1726
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
And then Konami actually did it in Japan

1727
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
And Konami kind of changed the game

1728
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
A little bit because the game

1729
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Is kind of like castles and pirate ships

1730
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Sort of theming

1731
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
And in the

1732
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Konami NES version they

1733
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Changed it to like samurai

1734
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
And things like that

1735
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
And I think maybe that's because they were

1736
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
A little more limited in the graphics

1737
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
They didn't really do the ocean as a thing

1738
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I don't know it's very interesting how they were different

1739
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
But part of what makes Rampart kind of unique

1740
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Is

1741
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Rampart they say

1742
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
They were credited anyway with being kind of a precursor

1743
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
To tower defense games

1744
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Because essentially that's what it was

1745
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
You were protecting towers

1746
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
As they were being attacked by little peons

1747
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
That would come try to attack them

1748
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
The peons were coming from these ships

1749
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
That were also attacking your towers

1750
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
With cannonballs

1751
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
And so the game was split up into different phases

1752
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
And for those of you that are watching along on Twitch

1753
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
You can kind of see these different phases play out

1754
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
One is you place the cannons

1755
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Within your forts

1756
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
One is it's a free for all battle

1757
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Between cannonballs

1758
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
So you're firing on the pirate ships

1759
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
They're firing on your castles

1760
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
The next phase after that is

1761
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Put back together your castles

1762
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
And so it's like a Tetris kind of style

1763
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
You have Tetris like pieces

1764
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
And you have to be able to surround

1765
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
At least one of your castle buildings

1766
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
With a bunch of Tetris pieces

1767
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
If you can't do that it's game over

1768
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
So you'll notice on the Twitch stream for those of you watching

1769
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
This guy right now is trying to surround

1770
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
In one bit and he did it there

1771
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
And he's got another one that's a little smaller

1772
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
So you can see he's kind of trying to build that together

1773
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
For those listening on the podcast you'll just have to imagine it

1774
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
But it's very easy to find gameplay of this game if you're interested

1775
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
And yes it's playable in MAME

1776
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Which I know a lot of people

1777
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Check out their arcade games out that way

1778
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
But it is a neat little game

1779
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
In the original game there are six different levels

1780
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Where you're attacking different ships

1781
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
And then trying to repair the damage

1782
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
And it's built into those different phases

1783
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
There is a multiplayer version of the game

1784
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
At least the arcade version has it

1785
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Not all of the home ports have it

1786
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
But some of them do

1787
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Interestingly enough I believe Konami's NES version

1788
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Is one of the ones that has it

1789
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Sounds like it's one of those cases where the Japanese

1790
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Port of the game was a little bit stronger

1791
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
If you are playing with two or three people

1792
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,000
The arcade version had blue, red, and yellow teams

1793
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
It was a rare three player arcade game

1794
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Except instead of fighting against ships

1795
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
You're fighting against each other

1796
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
You're fighting against each other

1797
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Your land is separated by a river

1798
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
And you're trying to blow each other's stuff up

1799
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
So that's kind of fun

1800
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
So yeah some of the strategy for this game

1801
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
It's easier to capture an unowned castle

1802
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Than try to repair the wall around a starting castle

1803
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
But if you kind of build close to the water

1804
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
You can have better aim

1805
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
So there's lots of little tricks and techniques

1806
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
To go into this

1807
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I was never very good at it

1808
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I just thought it was kind of fun to try to build

1809
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
The biggest surrounding piece of land I could

1810
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Where has this game been ported?

1811
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Everywhere in the 90s

1812
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
It was on the Super Nintendo, the Master System

1813
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
The Mega Drive, Genesis, Atari Lynx

1814
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
PC, Macintosh, Commodore 64

1815
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Amiga, Atari ST, Game Boy, Game Boy Color

1816
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
There's a lot of different ports

1817
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
And if that's not enough for you

1818
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
It was also included in the

1819
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Midway Arcade Treasures compilation

1820
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
So if you have a Midway compilation

1821
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
That was either on the GameCube

1822
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
The Playstation 2, the Xbox, or the Playstation Portable

1823
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
This game is on it

1824
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
And if you have the later

1825
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Arcade Origins series

1826
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
That was on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

1827
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
This game is on there as well

1828
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
And

1829
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I mean they've done this game a lot haven't they

1830
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
If you bought Gauntlet on the Game Boy Advance

1831
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
This game was there as well

1832
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
It was kind of like the B-side

1833
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Like when they did Final Fight

1834
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
And Magic Sword together

1835
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
And I was more about Magic Sword

1836
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
But it was kind of the B-side

1837
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
So Rampart was available in Gauntlet

1838
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
On the Game Boy Advance as well

1839
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
There's also some open source games

1840
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
That are basically clones of Rampart

1841
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Kajani Combat and Castle Combat

1842
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Are two of the names of those

1843
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
So kind of neat

1844
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
And yeah I really

1845
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
And they say this is kind of an influencer

1846
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Of the tower defense genre

1847
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
So yeah one of my very favorite

1848
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Kind of like puzzle games

1849
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I don't know like it does

1850
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Get a little bit old after a while

1851
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
But it is kind of like it's so unique

1852
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
That I can't help but if I actually

1853
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Find one of these machines

1854
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
I don't think they made a ton of these in the arcade

1855
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
So I don't see them very often

1856
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
But if I do see one I really have to play around

1857
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
For it so there you go

1858
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Dark Tetsuya says

1859
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I think there's a Japanese Famicom

1860
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Version of this too

1861
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Yeah I was mentioning that a little earlier

1862
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Is that Konami made the Japanese version

1863
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Whereas Jellico made the

1864
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
US version

1865
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
So it's kind of like Tetris

1866
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Where there was two different versions of it on the NES

1867
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Questbuster says

1868
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
My castles are fugly because I had no idea what I was doing

1869
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Same though

1870
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
And Questbuster says I loved watching someone else play it

1871
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
So I could see the cannons in action

1872
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Especially if the arcade cab had its volume up

1873
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Oh and something that really should

1874
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
One thing I need to mention about this game

1875
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Before we close up

1876
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
It ran on a trackball

1877
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
So you're placing all these pieces

1878
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
You're firing all the cannons

1879
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
They sold conversion kits for this

1880
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I think it would run on an old 720 machine

1881
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Or I'm trying to think of the other

1882
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Trackball Atari games

1883
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
From around this era

1884
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
But yeah it was actually a trackball game

1885
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
And I think that's important to say because if you do end up playing a clone

1886
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Or whatever it really helps

1887
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
To have a mouse

1888
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
So when you are playing it on Super Nintendo

1889
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Or even regular Nintendo

1890
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
You're not really able to play it with a mouse

1891
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Or did this game support

1892
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
The mouse peripheral

1893
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I don't think so

1894
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I think it was an NES game

1895
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
I'm pretty sure

1896
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
It was on both

1897
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Because the Super Nintendo one had mode 7

1898
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Where you could actually see your land

1899
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
In mode 7 and it was kind of cool

1900
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Because it was like ooh I built that and I'm seeing it in mode 7

1901
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
So that's kind of neat

1902
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Anyway there it is your classic game of the week

1903
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
One of my old school faves

1904
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
From the arcades in the 1990s

1905
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Rampart

1906
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
There you go my pick

1907
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I know that Sakura wasn't here to pick tonight

1908
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
But hopefully she'll be back next week

1909
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
And we'll get a pick from her

1910
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Although next week will be April

1911
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
So she might do a pinball game

1912
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Stay tuned we'll see

1913
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
For now let's move on and travel around the world quickly

1914
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
With some rapid fire news of what's going on in the industry

1915
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Loki

1916
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
So since we're getting a lot of people watching Netflix

1917
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
It's I guess appropriate that we have some Netflix news

1918
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
So there's I guess

1919
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Information going on saying that

1920
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Netflix is looking to develop

1921
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
A series

1922
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
And they're looking to have Ryan Reynolds

1923
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Set to produce and star in

1924
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I don't know if it's going to be a series or a film

1925
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
But at the very least something

1926
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
So

1927
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Interesting to see

1928
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I'd like to see that

1929
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
But I don't know

1930
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Live action is going to lose some of its

1931
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Charm I think

1932
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
But whatever

1933
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
I guess we'll have to see what happens

1934
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
I thought I had heard that it might be a half and half thing

1935
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Even though the Dark Sakura is not here

1936
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
I had to throw out a Xanadu reference

1937
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
For her

1938
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
As long as we get a Netflix adaptation

1939
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Of Brain Dead 13 then I'll be good too

1940
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I guess Space Ace will have to do that as well

1941
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
And then of course

1942
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Speaking of Netflix

1943
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Castlevania the animated series

1944
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Is getting a fourth season

1945
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
So that's pretty awesome

1946
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
And then

1947
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Of course

1948
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
And then of course

1949
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
So that's pretty awesome

1950
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Apparently

1951
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I guess the third season just came out

1952
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
At the beginning of this month

1953
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
So no date yet

1954
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
When the fourth one is going to be coming

1955
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
But I'm glad to see that it's doing well

1956
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I have not really watched that series

1957
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
I think I may have watched an episode of it

1958
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
But I mean it sounds like it's been

1959
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Doing pretty well

1960
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Yeah most people that have been watching it

1961
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Have said good things about it

1962
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
So it's one of those things

1963
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
But speaking of time sinks

1964
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
You know what else got renewed on Netflix

1965
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Which is really exciting

1966
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
It has nothing to do with video gaming

1967
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
But it's a game of sorts

1968
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
The Circle got renewed for seasons 2 and 3

1969
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
So that is really exciting news

1970
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
As did Love is Blind

1971
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Got renewed for seasons 2 and 3

1972
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Both those shows are crazy

1973
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Tiger King

1974
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Isn't Tiger King like a documentary?

1975
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Maybe they can't do a season 2

1976
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
But I'm sure they'll try to figure out a way to do it

1977
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
They found a way to do more seasons of Making a Murder

1978
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
So we'll see

1979
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
But

1980
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Yeah so there's those

1981
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
The Circle also has

1982
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
If you're really into that show on Netflix

1983
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
The Brazil one just came out

1984
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
And because Netflix is international

1985
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
You can watch The Circle Brazil

1986
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
With English subtitles

1987
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
So it's kind of like having another season of The Circle

1988
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
And apparently there is a French one coming to this

1989
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
The Circle France is coming as well

1990
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
If you're a fan of that crap

1991
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Like me

1992
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Alright anyway

1993
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Bobby Blackwolf says they're doing a season 2 of Tiger King

1994
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
It's going to be scripted

1995
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Kate McKinnon is in it

1996
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
She's playing the woman

1997
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
No way

1998
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Isn't that just something they're talking about on Twitter

1999
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Because like Dax Shepard is saying

2000
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Like he has to be the main guy

2001
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
In the movie version

2002
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Or the inevitable version of this

2003
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
And then what's

2004
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Edward Norton wanted to fight him for the part

2005
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
It's like crazy

2006
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Oh that sounds ridiculous

2007
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Yeah anyway

2008
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Wow he's linking me

2009
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
He's bringing the receipts

2010
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
He's linking me to a Deadline article

2011
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Apparently there is a Joe Exotic

2012
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Limited series starring Kate McKinnon

2013
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
You gotta be

2014
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
shitting me

2015
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Oh because this all got rolling

2016
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Back in November

2017
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
And now interest in the project

2018
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Is picked up again because of what's going on

2019
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
With the Netflix series

2020
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Interesting

2021
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
So it may not necessarily be tied to Netflix though

2022
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
But it probably will end up there

2023
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
We'll see

2024
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Alright well anyway

2025
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
On to other rapid fire news

2026
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Let's talk about Streets of Rage 4

2027
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Because I know some people only care about

2028
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Streets of Rage 4 because they want to hear new

2029
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Yuzo Koshiro music on the soundtrack

2030
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
I don't say I can blame you

2031
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I'm in a very similar position

2032
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
And the good news is you will be able to get the soundtrack

2033
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Or if you're a vinyl hipster

2034
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Which is completely understandable

2035
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
You can get the vinyl in summer of 2020

2036
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
And that will be a lot of fun as well

2037
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
So yes it has been confirmed that Streets of Rage 4

2038
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
OST will get a digital release

2039
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
On the same day as the game launches

2040
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
What day is that?

2041
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
We still don't know

2042
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
They're just saying it will be the same day

2043
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Soon

2044
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
That's right

2045
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Last week we talked about the Humble Brag

2046
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Which was the Humble Bundles version of Nintendo Direct

2047
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Yeah I checked that out

2048
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
It happened

2049
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
And what did you think?

2050
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Well let me quickly mention

2051
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Some of the things they talked about

2052
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Their publishing arm is going to be getting

2053
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
One Step from Eden on PC and Switch

2054
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Fae Tactics as well

2055
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
And then they talked about some partnerships

2056
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Including Wildfire which is a stealth game

2057
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Ambition, A Minuet of Power

2058
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Which is a roguelike

2059
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Proteus, not to be confused with Parodius

2060
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Which is a sci-fi first person shooter

2061
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Ring of Pain, a roguelike

2062
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
With card game pacing

2063
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
And The Iron Oath

2064
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
A turn based RPG in a dark fantasy world

2065
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
You actually watched it Loki, what did you think?

2066
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
It was okay

2067
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
I've been interested in Proteus a bit

2068
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
I was kind of disappointed that not everything

2069
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
That they were showing was stuff that's right around the corner

2070
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
But

2071
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
I mean it looked okay

2072
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I thought they were going to have some

2073
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Really amazing announcements

2074
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
But it was alright

2075
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
More Proteus footage is good

2076
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I think we're definitely going to see more and more companies

2077
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
That are kind of doing this

2078
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
As time goes on, that's for sure

2079
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Alright

2080
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Well let us move on and talk about

2081
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
World release dates and what is coming out

2082
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
In a country near you very soon

2083
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
So starting with the US?

2084
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Not a whole lot, but we've got Bubble Bobble 4

2085
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Friends on Nintendo Switch

2086
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Persona 5

2087
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Royale on Playstation 4

2088
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
My friend

2089
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Pedro on Playstation 4

2090
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
And then last but not least

2091
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Resident Evil 3

2092
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
On PC, Playstation 4

2093
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
And Xbox One

2094
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Alright, traveling to Japan

2095
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
And checking out the releases there

2096
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
On the Playstation 4

2097
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Biohazard 3

2098
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Which of course is Resident Evil 3

2099
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
That remake is getting its release on Playstation 4

2100
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
On April the 3rd

2101
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
That is a regular version and a Z version

2102
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Is coming out there

2103
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Shovel Knight also getting its Japanese release

2104
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
This week, so that's kind of fun

2105
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I'm guessing that's a localized version

2106
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
It may have already come out digitally

2107
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
But this is a physical version

2108
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
That's coming out as well

2109
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Over on the Nintendo Switch, also seeing

2110
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Shovel Knight as well

2111
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Kotoba no Puzzle

2112
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Is a game as well

2113
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
I don't know what the hell this is

2114
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Pika Pika Nurse Monogatari

2115
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Now I know you might think

2116
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
That that is some type of Pikachu thing

2117
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
But it's not, it's like a

2118
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Nursing simulator type of game

2119
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
So, and that is

2120
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
It's like Nursing Mama

2121
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Basically, so, yeah

2122
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Because you get to actually examine patients

2123
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
But it's all cute and chibi

2124
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
So, interesting

2125
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
So that's out this week

2126
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
And then there's a brand new Nintendo Switch Lite

2127
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Color coming out in Japan

2128
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
A Nintendo Switch Lite Coral version

2129
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Is out, so

2130
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Fun fun

2131
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Okay, Logi

2132
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
In the UK we've got

2133
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Onanaki, that's coming out on

2134
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
PlayStation 4 and Switch

2135
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Zombie Army Trilogy

2136
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
On a Nintendo Switch

2137
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Persona 5 Royale

2138
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
On PlayStation 4

2139
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Super Epic on PlayStation 4

2140
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
And Switch

2141
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Resident Evil 3

2142
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
On PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

2143
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
And that's it

2144
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Alrighty

2145
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Let's move on to our mailbag

2146
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Every week you guys send us emails

2147
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

2148
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
And we read some of our favorites here on the show

2149
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Although I'm sad to say yet again

2150
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
It looks like our mailbag was kind of empty

2151
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
So we don't have any emails to read

2152
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
But I will go to our Twitter

2153
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Account because we do

2154
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Field your tweets as well

2155
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
At OLR over on Twitter

2156
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
And we do have a tweet coming in this week

2157
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
From Flaco Jones who tweeted us

2158
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Saying, we haven't heard from Flaco

2159
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
In a while. Hello Flaco, I hope you're well

2160
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Flaco says, hey OLR

2161
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
My wife has been spending the bulk of her gaming time

2162
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
During the pandemic lockdown

2163
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Playing Wind Waker HD

2164
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
And she just talked to

2165
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
A certain someone very special

2166
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
To your show

2167
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
And attached is a gif image of

2168
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Tingle

2169
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
You can't even see that, whatever

2170
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Sorry, I was holding it up to the camera

2171
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Tingle has made an appearance

2172
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
In Wind Waker HD

2173
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Good choice to catch up on the gaming backlog

2174
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
You know, speaking of Zelda

2175
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
I know several people that have kind of

2176
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Restarted or picked up again

2177
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Their Breath of the Wild games

2178
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Because you know, talk about a game that you sink a lot of hours into

2179
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
That's another big one as well

2180
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Loki, any thoughts on

2181
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Wind Waker HD and

2182
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Tingle appearance?

2183
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
I already made my comment on that

2184
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Oh, what did you say? I missed it

2185
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
I replied, dislike

2186
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Dislike, whatever

2187
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Don't be a hater

2188
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Alright, so anyhow, there you go

2189
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
So in lack of

2190
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Emails this week, at least we got a tweet

2191
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
And I will be encouraging more folks to send us

2192
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Tweets for future weeks, because

2193
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
If we're going to continue to have an empty mailbag

2194
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Then we're going to change this segment

2195
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
A little bit, I'm not sure I'm going to delete the

2196
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Mailbag, but we're going to

2197
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Kind of open it up to other

2198
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Feedback mechanisms as well, so

2199
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Mails and tweets, I suppose

2200
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Don't make us go

2201
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Late 90s, early 2000s

2202
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Participate or die

2203
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
No, no, I mean

2204
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
You know, the reality is

2205
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Less and less people use

2206
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Email, because more and more

2207
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
People use social media

2208
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
And I think this is just one of those, maybe we have to

2209
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Evolve type of things, because

2210
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
People just aren't really using their email accounts

2211
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Like they used to, but it's very easy to send a tweet

2212
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
And you know, I

2213
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Probably should dust off the Facebook

2214
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
And try to get some more posts on there

2215
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
It's hard for me to put together this show

2216
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
And be the social media guy, so

2217
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
You know, we'll see, we'll do it again

2218
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
So, alright

2219
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Dark Tetsuya says, just do what you did with

2220
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
FUs, make it as needed if we do

2221
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Get any. The difference between this and FUs

2222
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Though is that, you know, this is the show where every gamer

2223
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Has a voice, and especially right now

2224
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Where we're having to use Discord to do the show, so we're not

2225
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Really doing calls on Discord

2226
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
And we weren't really getting a lot of those

2227
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Either, I think we just need to rethink

2228
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Some of the ways that we're letting people participate

2229
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
And so, you know what I need to do

2230
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
I just need to open an Animal Crossing

2231
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Town during the show, and you can participate

2232
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
By coming to visit and saying

2233
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Your message is there. That's staying

2234
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
On top of trends, right? So, anyway

2235
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Hey, I'm open to ideas

2236
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
If you think there's a way we should be

2237
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Getting more folks to interact with our show that we're not doing

2238
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Tweet me, email me

2239
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Anything, text me

2240
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
If you know my number, I'll take anything

2241
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
So, alright

2242
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Ooh, so

2243
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
So, you want to talk about participation

2244
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Bobby just got some late-breaking news

2245
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
For himself, Bobby said

2246
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
In chat, breaking news

2247
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
He has Tommy Tallarico coming on his show

2248
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Next week

2249
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
From television, yeah

2250
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
So, when are we going to be starting the show?

2251
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Like, 8 o'clock at night?

2252
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Do we get a show next week, Bobby?

2253
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Have we been bumped?

2254
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
I don't know, no, I'm kind of

2255
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Serious, what happens now to OLR

2256
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Because he's not going to hold

2257
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Himself to an hour

2258
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
We're going to have to figure that out

2259
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I did see the new video that he posted

2260
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
About the Intellivision

2261
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
With the new game series showing off

2262
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
And stuff like that

2263
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
In the controller

2264
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Showing off Missile Command, I believe

2265
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Yeah, I saw the Missile Command video as well

2266
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
I think they're very committed to that idea

2267
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Which is, you know

2268
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Some may say is the wrong idea right now

2269
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
In the time of Coronavirus

2270
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
But hopefully by the time this thing is out

2271
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Coronavirus is a memory

2272
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
God, let's hope so

2273
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
And I think maybe more than ever

2274
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
People will want to hang out in person again

2275
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Because they're going to realize how much they missed it

2276
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Because I will say

2277
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Even though the games are not

2278
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Packing the oomph

2279
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
In processing power of something like

2280
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Nintendo Switch or Playstation 4

2281
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
What have you

2282
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
It seems like the ideas they've committed to

2283
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
They're executing fairly well

2284
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Like the fact that the controller works on your phone

2285
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
As well as the

2286
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
You know, regular Bluetooth controller

2287
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Like that looks like it's

2288
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
You know, that Missile Command game they were playing

2289
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
The foreplayer looked very fast paced

2290
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
And it looked like it was doing very well

2291
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
So it's kind of interesting

2292
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Yeah, it looked pretty cool

2293
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Yeah, so I'm looking

2294
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Some folks in chat, OLR starting late

2295
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
OLR cancelled next week

2296
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Bobby says

2297
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
I'll try to wrap it at an hour

2298
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
We'll figure it out

2299
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
We're just joking

2300
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Well, here's the thing too

2301
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Honestly, if there's any time

2302
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
To screw with our times

2303
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
What else do we have going on

2304
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
The nice thing is

2305
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Loki and Dark Sakura aren't driving

2306
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
To get here at a certain time

2307
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
So if we do end up with a 6.30 start time

2308
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
It's not the end of the world

2309
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
We'll talk about it offline

2310
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
But I'm excited for you

2311
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
That'll be a fun interview

2312
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Alright, let's move on

2313
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Loki, you have another piece of news for us

2314
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Yes, so

2315
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
As we were kind of alluding to earlier

2316
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
With all the sports

2317
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Being kind of

2318
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Postponed right now

2319
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
So NASCAR is another thing

2320
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
That's now going to be

2321
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Kind of like an eSports coverage

2322
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
So they're gonna

2323
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Do their first NASCAR

2324
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
They had their first NASCAR

2325
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Virtual race over the weekend

2326
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
And now I guess

2327
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Fox and NASCAR have decided

2328
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
That they're gonna broadcast a whole season

2329
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Of it on TV

2330
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
And this is kind of similar to I guess

2331
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
What Formula One's been doing

2332
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
We talked about that last week

2333
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
So it's gonna be the E-Nascar iRacing Pro

2334
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Invitation Series event

2335
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Interesting

2336
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I mean, like I said

2337
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
This is kind of neat that

2338
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
eSports is kind of gonna be a thing

2339
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
That's coming more mainstream

2340
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
With different sporting

2341
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Events going to

2342
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Their kind of electronic equivalents

2343
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
It's also fascinating to me that you have

2344
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
The professional sports players for being able to

2345
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Do the physical sports that are kind of

2346
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Transitioning to the eSports side of things

2347
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
When it comes to these, you know, very

2348
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Intense simulators like iRacing

2349
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
You know, because that's supposed to really

2350
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Simulate the kind of NASCAR experience

2351
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Versus the other kind of

2352
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Traditional eSports athlete that learned

2353
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
To play said game

2354
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Because maybe it's not based on some

2355
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Well, even, I would say even something like Madden

2356
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Falls into this category

2357
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Madden is based off a sport in the real world

2358
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
And some might even call it a simulation

2359
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
But it doesn't really

2360
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Play like it, if that makes sense

2361
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
You know, like they're very, very different

2362
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Whereas I think when we talk about something like

2363
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
The iRacer, there's probably a lot

2364
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
That goes into it

2365
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
I'm not familiar with it myself, but I imagine

2366
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
It's like the Microsoft Flight Simulator

2367
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Of car racing where every, you know, nut and bolt

2368
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Is kind of represented there

2369
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
You know what I mean, whereas in Madden, it's kind of

2370
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Has to be dumbed down

2371
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
And I'm using my quotey fingers, I'm not saying that

2372
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
In a negative way

2373
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
For a controller, you know

2374
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
And the fact that you're not

2375
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Exerting physically in the same way

2376
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
If that makes sense, so

2377
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
But yeah, Bobby Blackwell says iRacing is what

2378
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
The drivers use to train when they can't get on a track

2379
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat over at

2380
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Twitch TV slash VOG Network says

2381
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
The NHL is simming the rest of their

2382
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Season, I almost said slimming, but it's

2383
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Simming the rest of their season

2384
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
In NHL 20, complete with

2385
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Players of the day and stat updates

2386
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
The team Twitter accounts are getting into it as well

2387
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
What else can you do

2388
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Because, you know, when you don't

2389
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Have games, you don't

2390
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Have the visibility

2391
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
You don't have the shirts

2392
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
And the merchandising and that stuff

2393
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Necessarily selling at the same pace

2394
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
I'm sure there's always going to be diehard fans

2395
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
That are looking for that stuff, but it's not going to be selling at the same pace

2396
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
So it's like anything that you can do

2397
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
To get people to be like, hey, remember

2398
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Hockey, like, it's

2399
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Going to be something they're going to try

2400
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
So, be interesting

2401
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
It's just, it is

2402
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Going to be so fascinating, the

2403
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Economic ripple that this is all

2404
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Going to have, and I'm not trying to say it in like

2405
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
A doom and gloom type of way

2406
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
But I mean, look at

2407
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Like Disney parks being shut down

2408
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
For six weeks, that's

2409
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Which is what we're looking at at this point

2410
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
I haven't officially said the reopening date

2411
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
But that's like crazy and unheard of, right?

2412
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
So like Disney

2413
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Disney's going to lose like six weeks

2414
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Of park income, do you know how much money that is?

2415
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
That's a lot of money

2416
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
It's a lot of fucking money

2417
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Now a company like Disney has multiple

2418
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
TV networks, movie studios and other things

2419
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
To kind of like keep them afloat

2420
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
So I'm not worried like, oh my god, Disney's going to go under

2421
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
But it's going to be like a rough transition

2422
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
I think for a lot of companies

2423
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Anyway, I don't want to burden us too much

2424
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
With the real world stuff, but I would just say

2425
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
When we get back to the real world

2426
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
When it's safe to do so

2427
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
It's going to be like driving on a road

2428
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
That hasn't been paved in a little while

2429
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
You'll get to the destination

2430
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
It's going to be a little bumpy

2431
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
There's going to be some potholes

2432
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
It'll be interesting

2433
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Yeah, Act Efton Chat says

2434
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
We're not talking millions, we're talking billions

2435
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Yeah, that's true, that is very true

2436
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
As Joe and Hunter Matt points out at six weeks

2437
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
For domestic parks, some of the international parks

2438
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Have been closed for months now

2439
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
So, we shall see

2440
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Alright, anyhow

2441
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Well, one interesting

2442
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Case of gaming worlds

2443
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Hopefully reflecting

2444
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
What might happen in the real world

2445
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Is that right now

2446
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
House evictions are being halted

2447
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
In Final Fantasy XIV

2448
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
And I play a lot of Final Fantasy XIV

2449
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
So let me kind of tell you what this really means

2450
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Because player housing is very highly contested

2451
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
In Final Fantasy XIV

2452
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Because there's only so much of it

2453
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
It's kind of a problem that's been facing the game

2454
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
For a long time

2455
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
There's a lot

2456
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
There's the different areas

2457
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
And then there's so many housing wards and plots

2458
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
In every area

2459
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
But it can be hard to get a house

2460
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Sometimes you have to just kind of camp out

2461
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
And hope that a plot becomes available

2462
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
And try to snatch that up as soon as you can

2463
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Because what happens in the way that plots become available

2464
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Is that if somebody doesn't log into their account

2465
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Or doesn't visit their house

2466
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
I believe it's in 45 days

2467
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I think there's a timer that starts after 30 days

2468
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
And if you go like another 15

2469
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Your house is basically demolished

2470
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
And your plot goes up for sale

2471
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Because you basically abandon it

2472
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
You get some of your investment back

2473
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
And any furniture you put in there

2474
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
You can go talk to an NPC and get it back

2475
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
But you've essentially lost your claim to the land

2476
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
So you get bounced for not having visited it

2477
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
And so the housing is

2478
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
And somebody will be there trying to buy it

2479
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
When that happens

2480
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
So I finally got my house

2481
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Because I went to a new server

2482
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
And I finally bought my house

2483
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Because somebody abandoned the land

2484
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
And I just happened to be in the right place

2485
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Right time and I got the house

2486
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Well, because not everybody is able to conduct their lives

2487
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
With the same pattern that maybe they were before

2488
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Not everybody is necessarily logging into Final Fantasy 14

2489
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
With the same, you know

2490
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
And especially probably people

2491
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
That are working on the front lines

2492
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
In places like healthcare and so forth

2493
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Probably aren't thinking about things like Final Fantasy 14

2494
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
That they used to

2495
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
So, the automatic demolishing system has been suspended

2496
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
So, and they've said

2497
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
In a statement from Square Enix

2498
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Quote, taking into account the worldwide spread

2499
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Of COVID-19 and the economical effects

2500
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Of various cities going into lockdown

2501
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
We've decided to temporarily

2502
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Suspend automatic housing demolition

2503
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Now that I'm saying this out loud

2504
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
This could also very much be

2505
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
For the sake of other countries

2506
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Maybe not so much the US

2507
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
But other places where cafes

2508
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
And that kind of pay in advance game time

2509
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Is like how you play it

2510
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
We have to remember in the US culture

2511
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Playing at home and that stuff

2512
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Is very much how you do it

2513
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
But there's other cultures where Final Fantasy 14 exists

2514
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Where you go to an internet cafe

2515
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
To play and log into your character

2516
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
And all that stuff

2517
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
So I would bet for the sake of those places

2518
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
That's why this is being

2519
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
You know, and it's kind of one of those

2520
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
It's easier to push the button for everybody

2521
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Than it is for just some places

2522
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
So there you go

2523
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
No more evictions in Final Fantasy 14

2524
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Until this is figured out

2525
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
So hopefully something that reflects

2526
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
The real world because I know there's a lot of people

2527
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
And I'm thinking of a lot of friends of mine

2528
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Who have been displaced from work

2529
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
I'm sure there's many of you out there listening

2530
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Because of what's going on in the real world

2531
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:02,000
And I'm glad to hear

2532
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
They're doing things like

2533
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Unemployment benefits

2534
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Like the stimulus package and so forth

2535
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
I think we know

2536
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
It's just the first of many things

2537
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
That need to be done

2538
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
So that we don't have just this complete

2539
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Catastrophe of people not being

2540
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Because where are all these people gonna go

2541
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
So hopefully the government

2542
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Is able to

2543
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Put a stop to people

2544
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Unnecessarily getting kicked out of

2545
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Their places

2546
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
So we'll see what develops

2547
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Over the next few weeks and months

2548
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Alright, well Loki we have a few more stories

2549
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Before we wrap up the show. Loki, you first

2550
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
So

2551
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Capcom has decided to cancel

2552
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Their Capcom Pro Tour

2553
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
At least the first half of it

2554
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Due to the COVID-19

2555
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Pandemic and they made their announcement

2556
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Via the Capcom Fighters

2557
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Twitter page basically saying that

2558
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Currently the Nobel coronavirus

2559
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
COVID-19 is projected to continue

2560
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
For several more months or longer

2561
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Across the world in light of this situation

2562
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Concerning the health and wellbeing of our players

2563
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Staff and visitors, all tournaments

2564
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Scheduled to be held in the first half of

2565
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
2020 Capcom Pro Tour

2566
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Season have been removed

2567
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
From the schedule. We apologize for any

2568
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Inconveniences may have caused players

2569
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Fans and tournament operators and production

2570
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Teams. The second half of the Capcom

2571
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Pro Tournament is scheduled to resume in

2572
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
July, but we will continue to monitor

2573
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
The novella coronavirus

2574
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Situation and we'll adjust

2575
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
The schedule and rules accordingly

2576
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
I mean it makes sense that it was gonna

2577
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
happen. Yeah it's just kind of another

2578
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
One of those up just add that to the list

2579
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Of things that are put on hold for a little bit but

2580
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
It is the right thing to do so

2581
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
We just you know I think now we're just all kind of

2582
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Wondering like when's where's that

2583
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Line gonna be of things that get

2584
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Canceled and things that don't get cancelled like when

2585
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
You know the government is

2586
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Talking about April 30th maybe

2587
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
We can start to relax some social

2588
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Maybe maybe

2589
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Does that mean we're gonna be able to have conventions

2590
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Again I don't know if it necessarily means

2591
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
That we might start to see what probably

2592
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Will happen is that maybe they'll still like

2593
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Allow you to go to restaurants and things but they're

2594
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Still gonna say to limit gatherings to a certain

2595
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Amount of people like you know what I mean and then maybe

2596
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Like May or June we start to

2597
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
See some of that come back as the line gets flattened

2598
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Even more hopefully so

2599
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Yeah I think it's gonna happen is they're gonna

2600
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Basically kind of scale it back

2601
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Kind of like how we saw it progressively

2602
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Get more restricted it's

2603
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Gonna kind of go the opposite direction

2604
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
SSU 100 Matt points out

2605
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
The Olympics was the big one that being shut

2606
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Down since a huge presidents yeah and that is not

2607
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
An easy thing to move and you know and I think

2608
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I think I mentioned this last week when we heard about

2609
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
This Olympics getting pushed back

2610
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Thing was kind of starting this puts that

2611
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Mario and Sonic at the 2020

2612
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Tokyo games that game that

2613
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Puts up in a very interesting predicament of

2614
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Being a licensed property

2615
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
For something that didn't happen

2616
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
That's not necessarily true

2617
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Because it will happen

2618
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
But it's specifically

2619
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
It's not called the Tokyo games

2620
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
It's called the 2020 Olympic games

2621
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
So yes yes it's fine

2622
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
You all want to get me on a technicality

2623
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Well it will happen in 2021 yes I understand that

2624
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
But the game is still the 2020

2625
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Another game they can make a second game

2626
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
So what I was gonna say is

2627
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
I mean it's not the most ridiculous

2628
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Property that's been created

2629
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Or no tie in

2630
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
You may remember there was a Spy

2631
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Hunter game that's starring

2632
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Vin Diesel that came out

2633
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Or I think it was Vin Diesel

2634
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Somebody some action star that came out

2635
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
And then the Spy Hunter movie never came out

2636
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Oh right

2637
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Yeah I remember they were working on a Spy Hunter movie

2638
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
And then they just kind of stopped doing that

2639
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Now Bobby is saying that the branding is still all gonna be

2640
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Tokyo 2020

2641
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Well that is gonna be interesting alright then I guess maybe it doesn't make that game

2642
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
As special as I thought but

2643
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
If all the branding Oh yes thank you

2644
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
It's The Rock I knew it was one of them

2645
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
But The Rock was

2646
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
One of those Fast and Furious

2647
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Guys one of them

2648
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
One of them was in it

2649
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Well Vin Diesel had the other one too

2650
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
There was another one though with Vin Diesel

2651
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
It was

2652
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
I don't remember what it was about

2653
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
But it was another car driving

2654
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Type game not like

2655
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Fast and the Furious or something but there was another

2656
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Spy thing with cars

2657
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
That he was in as well

2658
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Tiger Claw says The Wheelman

2659
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Yes that is thank you

2660
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
That was also supposed to be a movie

2661
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Alright

2662
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Well moving on and after this story

2663
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
We're gonna take your questions

2664
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
And comments from our chat room

2665
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
As we move into the listener round table

2666
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
So if you have any questions or things you want us to bring up

2667
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
That we haven't gotten to yet

2668
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Maybe we'll hit on in a last minute story

2669
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
But twitch.tv slash vog network

2670
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Or vog network is the place to leave some comments

2671
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Meanwhile

2672
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
We have news of a Nier

2673
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Remaster coming out

2674
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
So Nier is hitting its 10 year anniversary

2675
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
And there's going to be a

2676
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Remaster Nier Replicant

2677
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
That's coming out for the PC, Playstation 4

2678
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
And Xbox One

2679
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Now originally Nier Replicant

2680
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Was on Japan on the Playstation 3

2681
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
But in the West it was called

2682
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Nier Gestalt

2683
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Which then came to Japan on the Xbox 360

2684
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
There were different

2685
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Protagonists in the games

2686
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
But if you have a game and I know I have this game

2687
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
On the Xbox 360 that's just called

2688
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Nier, it's that, but with a different

2689
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Protagonist

2690
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
So essentially it's a remake of that older Nier game

2691
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
That was that, it's just some

2692
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Little changes there

2693
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
But I know a lot of people are pretty excited about that

2694
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
So it's coming out for Playstation 4, Xbox One

2695
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
And Steam

2696
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Just in time for the 10 year anniversary

2697
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
I'm a little surprised they're doing this

2698
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
And not an all new Nier game

2699
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
But maybe

2700
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
It's one of those things where a new Nier game

2701
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Is going to take a little time

2702
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Again, this is coming out on Playstation 4 and Xbox One

2703
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Maybe a new Nier game is something

2704
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
They're plotting for Playstation 5

2705
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
And Xbox Series X

2706
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
And so it's going to take them a little more time to cook that up

2707
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
So, understandable

2708
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Fifth Dream Today says

2709
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Best Music

2710
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Yeah, the

2711
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Raid in Final Fantasy that's based off Nier

2712
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Has some pretty amazing music in it

2713
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
I gotta say, it's really cool

2714
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Act Deft also points out

2715
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Nier Automata is coming to Xbox Game Pass

2716
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
On April 2nd

2717
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Yay, I'll finally get around to playing it

2718
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
After all this time

2719
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
So, I will make it a point to check that out

2720
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
I've heard nothing but great things about the Nier games

2721
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
So I need to check that out for sure

2722
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
So, alright

2723
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Well, we're going to open up the listener round table

2724
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
If you guys have any comments or questions

2725
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Or so forth

2726
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Act Deft in our chat says

2727
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Rob, the Mario and Sonic game is still special

2728
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Because it has Waluigi doing gymnastics

2729
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
That is true

2730
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Waluigi participating in those events

2731
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Is always going to be a special thing

2732
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Shehulk10 with a question for us

2733
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Do you guys have any

2734
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Old games that you liked

2735
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
But not really that popular

2736
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
That you would like to be given

2737
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
A current gen remake

2738
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Or makeover

2739
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Mine is Jaws the Revenge from 2006

2740
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Where you play as the

2741
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Shark

2742
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Oh my god, I forgot about that one

2743
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Do you remember that game? The Jaws but you're the shark

2744
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
I thought they had one that was just like that

2745
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Not too long ago

2746
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
It's another Jaws game

2747
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
I think it's Jaws

2748
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Man Eater

2749
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Yes, it looks

2750
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
There's a lot similar there

2751
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
It's not out yet

2752
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
But that is something that's coming

2753
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
So that's a good one

2754
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
One that we bring up a lot on this program

2755
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Is the Guardian Legend

2756
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Which is honestly one of the greatest

2757
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
8-bit games on the Nintendo

2758
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
It was kind of a hybrid of a shooter and Legend of Zelda

2759
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
And if you've never played the game

2760
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
I really urge you to go check out some YouTubes

2761
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Unfortunately I think it's one of those

2762
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Who owns the rights now

2763
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
That we probably are not going to see this game

2764
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
On Virtual Console or anything like that anytime soon

2765
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Although I would be so giddy if we ever did

2766
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
But I would love to see

2767
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
That come back

2768
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
But it has to be the right studio

2769
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
That does it

2770
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
And I would really want to see a company like WayForward

2771
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Because weren't they the ones behind the Blaster Master Zero?

2772
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Yes

2773
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Because that was done right

2774
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
That Blaster Master relaunched it

2775
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
And they even had the sequel as well

2776
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Which was kind of like a sequel that didn't really exist

2777
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Which is kind of awesome

2778
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
That I would want to see come back

2779
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
But it needs to be like

2780
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
As good as Blaster Master Zero was

2781
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
I would be very sad

2782
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
If it was kind of crap

2783
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Like they kind of

2784
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Like that other Blaster Master game

2785
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
That was on the Wii

2786
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Which was not that great because they tried to like redo too much

2787
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
And then the physics felt off

2788
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
And it kind of ruined the game

2789
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
BobbyBlackWolfe points out WayForward

2790
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Also did DuckTales Remastered

2791
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Which was also very well done

2792
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Very good point

2793
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Some other folks in chat are answering this question

2794
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
BobbyBlackWolfe says

2795
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
GuttaruMan

2796
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Very good answer

2797
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
ActDeft an old game I would love to see get a remake or make over

2798
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Uniracers

2799
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Repcycled in chat says

2800
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
StuntRaceFX

2801
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Which I'm sure is going to lead to the inevitable

2802
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Loki answer of ExciteBike

2803
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
ExciteTruck

2804
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
ExciteTruck get it right

2805
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Sorry my bad

2806
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
We've seen ExciteBike get remastered a few times

2807
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
But not ExciteTruck yet

2808
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Yes I'm all for that

2809
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
I'm all for an ExciteTruck

2810
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Yeah

2811
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Repcycled saying StuntRaceFX

2812
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
In a way I feel like ExciteTruck

2813
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Was a StuntRaceFX

2814
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
A little bit

2815
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
A little bit I don't know

2816
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
So those are some answers there

2817
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Loki any last minute stories

2818
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
While we wait and see if chat has any other questions

2819
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Or comments for us

2820
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Yes I do have one so

2821
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Apparently there was a push notification

2822
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
That went out

2823
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Just tonight saying that

2824
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
HQ Trivia is back

2825
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Apparently

2826
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
I think that was the trivia game that you can actually

2827
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Win real money

2828
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
That thing was like all the rage

2829
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
For like a month and then everybody quit

2830
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Yeah and if you saw their last episode

2831
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
It was great go look it up on YouTube

2832
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Because they were drunk and they didn't

2833
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Give a fuck

2834
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
They were swearing and doing all this stuff

2835
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
They were probably high

2836
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
They were just like we're closing tonight

2837
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Whatever it's the last one

2838
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
And the guy put up a prize of $5

2839
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Of his own money

2840
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
It was great

2841
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
It was like total

2842
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
They're coming back tonight

2843
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
So

2844
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Alright cool I guess

2845
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
You know maybe it's one of those things

2846
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Where it's like now is the time for that

2847
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Maybe they see an opportunity where it's like

2848
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Everybody's stuck at home

2849
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Let's try this again

2850
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
They must have had a financier step in

2851
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
And be like now's the time

2852
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
An anonymous investor

2853
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
That's what it is

2854
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
ActDeft in chat

2855
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Says question for Robin Loki

2856
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Have you seen that Twitter tag meme

2857
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
To post four games that defined you

2858
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Well what are yours

2859
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
I have seen that meme

2860
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
I just held off on doing it

2861
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Because I don't like tag memes

2862
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Because then it's like I have to tag people

2863
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
That probably won't do it and then it's like

2864
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Why don't you tag me

2865
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
That's basically an email for no thanks

2866
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
There's a lot about those memes I don't really like

2867
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
But let's take the

2868
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Because the question is still good

2869
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
So let's take the question out of that

2870
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Four games that define you

2871
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
This is tricky

2872
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
I'd have to really think on this

2873
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
But in the moment I'm gonna say

2874
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
One of the obvious answers is Dance Dance Revolution

2875
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Without that game I wouldn't know Loki

2876
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
I wouldn't know any of you

2877
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Because I wouldn't have had this show

2878
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
So that's at the top of the list

2879
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Other games

2880
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
So I'm gonna try to let that be the music game representation

2881
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
I would say the original Legend of Zelda

2882
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
On the NES

2883
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Just because that was the game

2884
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
That really turned me into a video game nerd

2885
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Because that was the one where other kids

2886
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Who used to bully me would then

2887
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Secretly want to ask me questions about

2888
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
So how do I get to the fourth dungeon in the second quest

2889
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Yeah right stuff like that

2890
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
So I would say that game was very definitive

2891
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Two more

2892
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo

2893
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Because of the

2894
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Because of the

2895
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Fucking crazy amount of that I played in college

2896
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
I think that's really all I need to say about that one

2897
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
And that was kind of like the PlayStation

2898
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
I almost said Final Fantasy 7

2899
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
But then I was like no you know what PlayStation game got even more time

2900
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Was Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo

2901
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
And then a fourth game

2902
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Probably some sort of MMO

2903
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Maybe I will say

2904
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Final Fantasy 11

2905
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Again I'm not really giving this a lot of thought

2906
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
I'm kind of answering this spontaneously

2907
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
But those are the four that come up spontaneously

2908
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
But I feel like an MMO needs representation in there

2909
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
I had an MMO based podcast for many years

2910
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
And that way the Final Fantasy franchise gets represented as well

2911
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Which I've always been a big fan of

2912
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Alright Loki what about you

2913
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Four games that define you

2914
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
So I have to say

2915
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Final Fantasy 7

2916
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Final Fantasy 7

2917
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
So I have to say

2918
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Dance Man's Revolution

2919
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
I mean probably the whole series

2920
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Because they can't really

2921
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
I guess fourth mix if we had to pick

2922
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
A game

2923
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Third mix plus Korean

2924
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Is mine

2925
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Okay

2926
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
And then I would say

2927
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Grand Theft Auto 4

2928
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Because I played a ton of that

2929
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Let's see

2930
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
I would probably have to say

2931
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Final Fantasy 11

2932
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
And

2933
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Yeah probably The Legend of Zelda

2934
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Because that was one of the first Nintendo games I got

2935
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Driver 3

2936
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
I didn't play enough Driver 3

2937
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Saints Row

2938
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Okay yeah I did play a ton of Saints Row

2939
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
She-Hulk 10

2940
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
I like this answer

2941
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Pac-Man Asteroids

2942
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Halo Mass Effect

2943
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
I'm really surprised I didn't put

2944
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Mass Effect the trilogy on my list

2945
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
See that's a my bad for not thinking

2946
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
That through further but

2947
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
You know I think I don't know if I would say

2948
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Mass Effect defined me

2949
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
As much as

2950
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
I really fucking liked

2951
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Mass Effect

2952
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Because I kind of feel like there's a difference

2953
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
You know what I mean

2954
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
I'm not critical of how anybody else

2955
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Wants to answer this question I'm just saying when I answered it

2956
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Things that I'm thinking of are like

2957
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Like this podcast

2958
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
And the many many many hours

2959
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Would not exist if not for DDR and so on

2960
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Kind of the different reasons I gave

2961
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
But like as far as like

2962
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Things I really enjoyed I would really have to

2963
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Probably put Mass Effect on that list

2964
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
As well so

2965
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Really good question I like that I guess that's a good one

2966
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
To end on so any other last minute stories

2967
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Loki before we wrap up

2968
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Yeah so

2969
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Couple more

2970
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
I talked about GameStop closing 300

2971
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Stores so it's actually about 320

2972
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Stores in 2020

2973
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
This was due to their 2019

2974
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Investors call

2975
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Apparently they're saying we're continuing to

2976
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Focus optimizing our global

2977
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Store fleet in fiscal 2019

2978
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
And closing that total

2979
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Of 321

2980
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Stores inclusive of

2981
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
333 closings and 12

2982
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Openings and in fiscal

2983
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
2020 we will continue our efforts

2984
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
To de-densify the store

2985
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Base and focus on

2986
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Maximizing product

2987
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Productivity of the entire fleet

2988
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
So

2989
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
I mean this was as of a call

2990
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Last week

2991
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
So who knows the toll that

2992
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Other real world stuff might take on this

2993
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
But they were already planning to close 300

2994
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
They were already doing that like I already

2995
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Like I said my local store is

2996
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Closing I know that he

2997
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
The guys there were

2998
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Promising me some stuff but I know

2999
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
That they haven't been in the store for

3000
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
You know a week or so

3001
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
So I don't even know what that's doing

3002
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
To their closing because they were

3003
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Doing like closeout stuff but they still have a ton

3004
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Of product in the store and

3005
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
I mean if they're not open I don't know what that does

3006
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
For them if they're just going to postpone the closure

3007
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Of them until they can open again

3008
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Or what the case may be

3009
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
I was thinking

3010
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Going back on that four games question and I can't

3011
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Believe I didn't fucking say Ingress

3012
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Just because of like

3013
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
I've traveled to cities I wouldn't have gone to

3014
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Otherwise if it wasn't for that game

3015
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Yeah so there's

3016
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
I have to really sit down and think about that one

3017
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Long and hard there's a lot of good answers

3018
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
For that I think so

3019
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Anyway

3020
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Because somebody else said Pokemon

3021
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
It made me think Pokemon Go and then I was like oh yeah

3022
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Ingress I should have said Ingress because I've been playing that way too long

3023
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Maybe Ingress

3024
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Just slipped my mind because I haven't been playing

3025
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
It the past couple weeks I wonder what

3026
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
I mean a little

3027
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Bit like when I walked

3028
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
30 minutes to another

3029
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Park I played it at the park

3030
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
And then walked back but that's like it

3031
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Like I'm not playing it nearly

3032
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
At the level I was playing it before

3033
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
So interesting

3034
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Yeah SG100Matt says Rob didn't say

3035
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Super Metroid either

3036
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
No I didn't because again

3037
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
The question was the games that defined you

3038
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Not which games do you really really really really like

3039
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
I think there's a difference

3040
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
You know it really is

3041
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Anyway

3042
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
So that's it for last minute stories Logie

3043
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
I was going to say there's one more

3044
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
It's kind of silly

3045
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
So Crash Nitro

3046
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Field Racing

3047
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Or Crash Team Racing Nitro Field

3048
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
They had a funny

3049
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
April Fools

3050
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Day

3051
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
DLC that they're putting out

3052
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
So apparently it's free

3053
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Which is good and so what happens

3054
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Is if you smash some of these

3055
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Benox crates scattered throughout the tracks

3056
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
You can actually

3057
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Unlock a hidden crate

3058
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Cart

3059
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
So the hidden

3060
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
It's like a

3061
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
A benox crate

3062
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Is the driver of the cart

3063
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
One of the smashing crates

3064
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
From Crash Team

3065
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Huh interesting

3066
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
That's a little silly

3067
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
I kind of like though that they

3068
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Are doing an April Fools

3069
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Something along those lines because I think a lot of us

3070
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Are going to be really tired of April Fools

3071
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Day this year for all intents and purposes

3072
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
April Fools Day is cancelled

3073
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Just don't

3074
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
April Fools Day? Don't

3075
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Not this year, not today Satan

3076
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
There's too much other stuff going on in the room

3077
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
But I think cute things

3078
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Like this

3079
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Ready for it

3080
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Extra things, sideshow, okay

3081
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Okay we can do that

3082
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
But that's about all we can tolerate right now

3083
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
No jokes

3084
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Anyhow

3085
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Alright I think with that we will go ahead and wrap things up

3086
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
I know it's a little bit shorter of a show

3087
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
But we didn't have Jamie tonight

3088
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
We're on Discord so I think things will be a little bit

3089
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Shorter just in the interim

3090
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
We still filled a good about two hours or so

3091
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Nonetheless

3092
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Almost two hours

3093
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
We want to thank you guys for being here and tuning in this week

3094
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Whether it was live on Sunday night

3095
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Over the Voice Geeks Network Twitch channel

3096
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Or if it was on the podcast feed

3097
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Really appreciate that

3098
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Songs Radio

3099
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice

3100
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
But the more voices we get here on Sunday nights

3101
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
And on our podcast feed

3102
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Throughout the week sending us tweets and things like that

3103
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
The more we can get your voices out there

3104
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
So tell a friend or two about the show

3105
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Help us spread the word

3106
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Auto hosts on your Twitch channel go a long way

3107
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Please consider adding VOG Network to your host list

3108
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
That would be super awesome

3109
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
And then just you know sharing on social media

3110
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
The Spotify link or things like that whatever

3111
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Those things come in very very very very handy

3112
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Really appreciate those of you guys that do that

3113
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
That's going to do it for this week

3114
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
We'll be back in seven days to talk all again

3115
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
And hopefully Dar Sacro will be back with us

3116
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
And can talk about other stuff

3117
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
We'll probably still be remote via Discord

3118
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
For a little while but that's okay

3119
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
We'll talk about whatever's going on in gaming

3120
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Loki I guess we get to final thoughts

3121
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Any final thoughts from you tonight?

3122
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Yes I've been staring at a black widow

3123
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
That's been in my

3124
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
My

3125
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
monitor arms

3126
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
And it's just

3127
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
It's crawled up inside there now

3128
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
And now I have to somehow take this apart

3129
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
And go kill it

3130
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
I think you're going to be burning your house down later

3131
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Honestly and I

3132
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
That's the reason to do it

3133
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
So

3134
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
And then my final thoughts

3135
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Tonight is

3136
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Just keep staying inside

3137
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
If I can do it you can do it

3138
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
And enjoy the games

3139
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Catch up on your backlog

3140
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
You'll have some near on Xbox Game Pass this week

3141
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
You've got plenty of other free games out there

3142
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
And stuff in your backlog

3143
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
So check it all out this week

3144
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Have fun and we'll see you

3145
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
On Twitch and on the podcast feed

3146
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
In seven more days

3147
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Have a great week everybody

3148
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Good night

3149
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000

See you next week
