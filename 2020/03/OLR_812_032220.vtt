00:00.000 --> 00:17.960
This week Doom Eternal isn't in the show role but it has to be mentioned that it's

00:17.960 --> 00:21.560
a fantastic game and it's load times are incredible.

00:21.560 --> 00:24.500
This is what I wanted to say, stay tuned for your host stories of the week starting right

00:24.500 --> 00:28.840

00:28.840 --> 00:34.960
Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet

00:34.960 --> 00:39.320
and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice it is Orange

00:39.320 --> 00:47.200
Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 812 for this March the 22nd of 2020.

00:47.200 --> 00:53.260
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined in studio by Captain Pikachu at my side so here's what's

00:53.260 --> 00:54.260
going on.

00:54.260 --> 00:58.500
This is a little different for Orange Lounge Radio tonight even though I am here in studio

00:58.500 --> 01:04.680
N7 because if you haven't figured it out by now studio N7 is at my house so I'm here.

01:04.680 --> 01:10.400
My co-host tonight we're doing a little bit of social distancing as many folks out there

01:10.400 --> 01:15.440
in the world are doing because it's the right thing to do to help slow the spread of this

01:15.440 --> 01:18.560
horrible thing that's going around that's really you know affecting us all and affecting

01:18.560 --> 01:19.560
our world right now.

01:19.560 --> 01:24.180
So I am joined though thanks to the magic of discord I am joined tonight by of course

01:24.180 --> 01:26.840
DarkSakura or Jamie Summers should be there.

01:27.380 --> 01:27.880
Hi.

01:27.880 --> 01:28.880
Hi how are you?

01:29.880 --> 01:35.140
Um I had a flare-up but um hopefully healing so we'll see.

01:35.140 --> 01:41.240
Now as a follow-up to last week you found out that you have pneumonia and not the big

01:41.240 --> 01:43.040
C right?

01:43.040 --> 01:50.460
That's what she said but um I just finished my antibiotics and um I had a flare-up last

01:50.460 --> 01:57.080
night so I don't know um what's going on but I was I had a couple days with no fever

01:57.080 --> 02:04.200
and then I started running a fever again last night running a fever today so we'll see.

02:04.200 --> 02:08.100
Well my fingers and toes and I'm sure all of us are crossed that uh everything is gonna

02:08.100 --> 02:12.760
go just fine with your recovery it's it's one of those really weird kind of uh states

02:12.760 --> 02:19.360
of the world in 2020 where we're sitting here going yay it's just pneumonia when that's

02:19.360 --> 02:24.300
actually not particularly a great thing to be talking about so but um in all seriousness

02:24.300 --> 02:29.320
thank you for being here tonight um despite how you're feeling um but I mean I've relatively

02:29.320 --> 02:33.460
is your energy's been there you've been able to play games and do stuff around the house?

02:33.460 --> 02:40.740
Well that not that that requires a whole lot of uh energy but um I've uh I've been playing

02:40.740 --> 02:47.740
a lot of a lot of stuff on my switch you know what I'm playing and I baked bread which wasn't

02:47.740 --> 02:53.240
the best idea but it was delicious. Well hey it's uh hard to find bread at some of the

02:53.240 --> 02:57.720
stores right now so I'm I hear a lot of people yeah I hear a lot of people are kind of baking

02:57.720 --> 03:02.600
right now um speaking of baking uh also joining us tonight via discord I believe should be

03:02.600 --> 03:07.320
there is Techmaster Loki. I'm not baking anything. I thought I thought you said something about

03:07.320 --> 03:12.840
the air fryer before we went live. Oh oh no that that's yeah that's Nellie cooking dinner

03:12.840 --> 03:18.240
I'm sure it's like some Asian or something. Gotcha okay so again um this is a little new

03:18.240 --> 03:23.180
for us uh here at Orange Launch Radio you know we started this show back in 2002 if

03:23.180 --> 03:28.980
you were unaware and um you know in that year we didn't really have you know when we started

03:28.980 --> 03:33.720
this whole thing on the Live 365 network we were dial-up friendly radios so that was the

03:33.720 --> 03:36.980
way many people were still connecting to the internet so we didn't have things like Skype

03:36.980 --> 03:40.520
and you know all that there was no iPhone yet or any type of smartphone really at that

03:40.520 --> 03:46.340
point um and so we kind of got used to doing this show in the same room um and that's kind

03:46.340 --> 03:49.980
of where this show you know and when people ask like well it makes you different than

03:49.980 --> 03:53.760
other gaming podcasts I can talk about how long we've been around but also I think part

03:53.760 --> 03:57.800
of what makes us a little bit different is that uh we are usually all in the same room

03:57.800 --> 04:01.880
so we can kind of play off each other and all that stuff um but obviously as you guys

04:01.880 --> 04:06.900
know being in the same room is not really an option right now I mean I guess technically

04:06.900 --> 04:12.160
the whole stay at home thing would allow like six people to get together but the reality

04:12.160 --> 04:17.420
is um if you can practice social distancing you should so we're setting an example I hope

04:17.420 --> 04:20.980
tonight by doing things a little differently but therefore my point with that is the audio

04:20.980 --> 04:24.900
quality may not be quite what you're used to so you'll have to forgive us a little bit

04:24.900 --> 04:30.580
um but you know we had to kind of throw things together as they say uh to make tonight's

04:30.580 --> 04:35.360
show happen uh thanks to the magic of discord so um but of course if you do want to join

04:35.360 --> 04:40.280
us live you can we do tape live every sunday night at the voice geeks network twitch.tv

04:40.280 --> 04:45.680
slash vog network we're on at 6 p.m pacific nine o'clock eastern right after the bobby

04:45.680 --> 04:51.320
black wolf show um again that's over twitch.tv slash vog network and yes bobby does have

04:51.320 --> 04:55.960
a good point here um bobby says podcasts are technically exempt from the shelter in place

04:55.960 --> 05:00.640
ruling at least in los angeles county but I wouldn't expect a gaming podcast to risk

05:00.640 --> 05:06.340
that and yeah it's one of those things where it's like you know if um if maybe our podcast

05:06.340 --> 05:12.200
was uh spreading awareness about disease prevention or was like a news-based podcast or something

05:12.200 --> 05:17.040
a little more like you know uh traditional media I suppose where there's a benefit for

05:17.040 --> 05:21.960
us all being in the same room or out in the field reporting so to speak then yeah we could

05:21.960 --> 05:25.960
bend the rules a little bit but since you know we I've heard that we're an essential

05:25.960 --> 05:31.280
podcast though so it's fine we can skirt by all of the laws because of that we are

05:31.280 --> 05:35.600
an essential podcast I've I believe that's that's the rule that we're setting orange

05:35.600 --> 05:40.880
launch radio essential podcasting uh so well okay funny you bring that up because obviously

05:40.880 --> 05:45.920
that's going to tie into tonight's kickoff topic which I'm sure is on a lot of people's

05:45.920 --> 05:49.880
minds uh this week as they've been reading all the updates with what's going on in the

05:49.880 --> 05:54.000
world um dark sakura why don't you start us off because I know you had some thoughts when

05:54.000 --> 06:05.080
it came to this topic um well um it's uh I have friends that work there number one

06:05.080 --> 06:09.120
and one of my friends flat out told me when I was talking about picking up my pre-order

06:09.120 --> 06:15.760
because I had actually switched it to her store um is that um I should just not pick

06:15.760 --> 06:22.300
up my game and get it digitally or from somewhere else um after having talked to her she was

06:22.300 --> 06:28.260
like yeah and was linking me to all these other people they were telling you know their

06:28.260 --> 06:33.100
the press release at game stop was saying that they were sending cleaning material and

06:33.100 --> 06:37.580
hand sanitizer to all the stores which was a lie they were telling the managers to go

06:37.580 --> 06:42.420
get them and of course where are they there's none to be found and they were having to pay

06:42.420 --> 06:49.580
for it out of pocket so um and they were telling people to go home if they were sick but they

06:49.580 --> 06:55.180
were calling people in while they were sick because they didn't have enough people to

06:55.180 --> 07:01.220
watch the desk or anything like that to keep the store open so um you know it was it was

07:01.220 --> 07:08.380
really terrible um and then of course it was putting longer hours on the people who were

07:08.380 --> 07:15.520
okay to work and you know and then on top of that they're endangering people by having

07:15.520 --> 07:23.600
people come in by not maintaining um any type of proper social distancing and so um and on top

07:23.600 --> 07:27.320
of that they're not a freaking essential business I'm sorry well I'm not sorry because they're not

07:27.320 --> 07:32.160
yeah and it sounds like you know it's interesting because you know we've taught and I've mentioned

07:32.160 --> 07:36.640
this on the show and I'm sure we have folks that work at GameStop stores that listen to this show

07:36.640 --> 07:42.160
and I hope you all understand the issues that we've taken up with you know the evil G or whatever

07:42.160 --> 07:46.680
you want to call it over the years has nothing to do with the hard-working folks at the stores

07:46.680 --> 07:54.080
or even the store managers it's and and I think nothing has ever made this more apparent than

07:54.080 --> 07:58.760
this particular story we're talking about now with what's going on with COVID is that you know

07:58.760 --> 08:03.960
and you mentioned like you're being told under the table essentially by employees like yo don't come

08:03.960 --> 08:08.360
in here because what they're telling you isn't the reality of what's going on they're not saying

08:08.360 --> 08:13.320
and I mean that is a huge disconnect when the corporate is saying oh yeah we're we're sending

08:13.320 --> 08:17.800
out sanitizer and all that really cuz we're all having a hard time finding it but okay but we're

08:17.800 --> 08:21.540
gonna go make our so they're saying they're sending it all out but that's not true they're

08:21.540 --> 08:25.640
making the store managers as if they didn't have to go through enough go out and find this stuff

08:25.640 --> 08:31.680
when we all know we all have a television that or radio or whatever you use we all know that you

08:31.680 --> 08:37.640
can't find that stuff right now so to say that these stores are all stock to that is is untrue

08:37.640 --> 08:45.000
and it's it's it's really irresponsible and I I suppose you could make a stretch argument that

08:45.000 --> 08:50.960
maybe GameStop deals somewhat in computing supplies and those computing supplies would

08:50.960 --> 08:56.720
be important to teleworkers but let's be real that's not what GameStop was selling on Friday

08:56.720 --> 09:02.240
night GameStop was selling all those pre-orders of Animal Crossing and Doom Eternal that they

09:02.240 --> 09:07.440
wanted to keep those sales on and I think that was pretty apparent and what was going on yeah

09:07.760 --> 09:16.960
they it's really you know and not to go on too much of the political side of things but you know

09:16.960 --> 09:24.680
we're we're watching the crumbling of capitalism right now because people are trying to first of

09:24.680 --> 09:30.920
all you know make a profit at the expense of other people that that's really how I see it you know I

09:31.160 --> 09:37.800
mean but on top of that though with so many businesses closing down it's really people

09:37.800 --> 09:41.280
don't have a way of bringing in the money and people aren't going out and spending it either

09:41.280 --> 09:47.720
so I you know I you can't blame I'm equal you can't blame them but but in the same run when

09:47.720 --> 09:53.760
your company is at the core of itself in the business to make money it doesn't really feel

09:53.760 --> 10:00.400
responsible to the public that comes out right then and there in in the public so yeah and I

10:00.400 --> 10:06.640
think I think you can definitely you know still say like you know without being political I think

10:06.640 --> 10:10.800
there's definitely going to be a conversation around all there's gonna be conversation about

10:10.800 --> 10:15.280
people being able to stay home sick when they're actually sick there's gonna be a conversation

10:15.280 --> 10:20.200
about you know being able to access health care and getting health care needs and whether that

10:20.200 --> 10:24.640
should be tied to having a job or not and you know now I don't know what the answer is to that

10:24.760 --> 10:31.720
some folks will be you know with Bernie on that some folks will be with more middle-ground Democrats

10:31.720 --> 10:36.560
on that some people will be with Trump or possibly Mitt Romney or other Republicans on that because

10:36.560 --> 10:41.160
there's all sorts of different answers out there but I think a conversation will certainly be had

10:41.160 --> 10:47.000
certainly be had especially just real quick sorry especially with the I guess this would be

10:47.000 --> 10:52.640
appropriate use of the term she's in Freud where you have you know the one senator who voted

10:52.640 --> 10:57.480
against the one of the stimulus packages has now come down with coronavirus I mean the fact that

10:57.480 --> 11:03.960
this is now on Washington DC's doorstep literally and cannot be ignored no matter how you feel about

11:03.960 --> 11:07.920
that politician or any of that stuff the fact that is on their doorstep and cannot be ignored

11:07.920 --> 11:14.040
that is going to cause a conversation to happen if nothing else I will point this out though that

11:14.040 --> 11:24.760
right now Bernie did take his campaign resources and immediately filtered it into providing

11:24.760 --> 11:36.160
services to people who are ill jobless and to fighting the the spread of the disease I hope

11:36.160 --> 11:41.960
we see all of Washington DC follow suit very soon it is you haven't seen Biden do it we have

11:41.960 --> 11:47.520
definitely seen a lot of companies that are really stepping up to be able to like I saw one going on

11:47.520 --> 11:50.800
Twitter and I apologize I forget the name of the company in the moment they're coming up and making

11:50.800 --> 11:56.440
masks Oh Christian Siriano the fashion designer famous from Project Runway is starting to make

11:56.440 --> 12:01.400
more masks for you know New York and and because there's obviously a big outbreak there and so

12:01.400 --> 12:05.320
forth so I think you're definitely gonna see and to tie this back to video games you're definitely

12:05.320 --> 12:10.280
starting to see when it comes to the corporations who the people are that are stepping up right and

12:10.280 --> 12:15.280
who the people are that are slipping down and GameStop is one of those companies that's slipping

12:15.280 --> 12:21.480
down because of all this at a time when GameStop needs not to be slipping down and again I feel for

12:21.480 --> 12:27.400
a lot of those people on the front lines and so forth because these bad decisions are not theirs

12:27.400 --> 12:33.440
but it's making everybody a GameStop look bad and it's it's really unfortunate and I got two words

12:33.440 --> 12:39.800
hostile takeover and I know a lot of people are talking maybe Reggie will come in there and

12:39.800 --> 12:45.120
reminder Reggie has nothing to do with this if you go back and listen there go go Google News

12:45.120 --> 12:49.640
search the Reggie thing and his thing about joining GameStop that's not effective until

12:49.640 --> 12:57.560
mid-april so Reggie has nothing to do with any of this in fact he might reverse decision as a result

12:57.560 --> 13:04.920
I don't know the contracts may already be signed I don't know but the reality is Reggie's gonna be

13:04.920 --> 13:10.040
walking into something big but again he's not gonna be the CEO he's gonna be a member of the

13:10.040 --> 13:15.440
board but I don't know if he's gonna necessarily be the hero that everybody hopes he is but we

13:15.440 --> 13:21.400
hope there is a hero at GameStop or that comes in and buys them or something and turns them around

13:21.400 --> 13:29.200
I think so anyway Loki I don't know if you had some other things you wanted to add to this I

13:29.200 --> 13:34.280
know you've been following a lot of what's going around with GameStop right yeah so there was quite

13:34.280 --> 13:38.200
a few stories like cuz the whole thing was kind of developing over the week so you first you had

13:38.200 --> 13:43.760
of course what Jamie alluded to where there was the memos going out to store saying that they're

13:43.760 --> 13:49.040
going to be providing them with you know disinfectant supplies and you basically stuff to

13:49.040 --> 13:55.240
kind of stave off some of the germs and everything that might be there you know kind of the same

13:55.240 --> 14:02.520
message a lot of different locations were saying and then there was the whole recommendation that

14:02.520 --> 14:10.320
they should close you know non-essential retailers and then of course GameStop making the argument

14:10.320 --> 14:20.000
that well we are essential retail and we're going to you know fight that order and basically the

14:20.000 --> 14:25.840
employees just not even happy with that at all I mean just very much against it a lot of folks

14:25.840 --> 14:32.160
quitting over this but it's almost like they suddenly unionized they didn't say that word

14:32.160 --> 14:36.480
but you know when everybody kind of bands together to do the it's interesting it's very interesting

14:36.800 --> 14:42.480
oh yeah absolutely and then and then what was kind of crazy too is along the same time there

14:42.480 --> 14:51.000
was this one youtuber that leaked a call with the executives is one of the GameStop calls that they

14:51.000 --> 14:56.280
had talking about the whole situation and everything and that did not sound well because there's a lot

14:56.280 --> 15:02.000
of concerned employees that were basically asking me hey what's gonna happen you know you're telling

15:02.000 --> 15:07.360
us to come in and you know we're not gonna get paid if we take time off or whatever you know I

15:07.360 --> 15:12.240
don't want to be exposed to this I'm you know living with my elderly grandma I I don't want to

15:12.240 --> 15:18.440
expose her to kovin 19 and you know they didn't really have much a response other than well we're

15:18.440 --> 15:23.200
taking a day at a time and that type of stuff and then kind of funny you know after a whole

15:23.200 --> 15:29.240
California you know officially you know say okay you guys have to all close finally then did they

15:29.240 --> 15:35.960
actually close their doors but before that you know obviously you could tell what the goal was

15:35.960 --> 15:40.920
because they were putting out their pre-orders for both Animal Crossing and Doom Eternal early

15:40.920 --> 15:47.800
and then you know some of the follow-up with that it sounds like that finally the CEO is gonna give

15:47.800 --> 15:54.480
them some paid time off and some compensation for coming in on these days and then I did find that

15:54.480 --> 16:00.600
one funny screenshot where they in Pennsylvania they've yanked their business license at least so

16:00.600 --> 16:05.040
that was kind of interesting is that is that proven because that I saw that I think we all

16:05.040 --> 16:10.200
many of us saw that picture of the printout that was on the door or something but that didn't look

16:10.200 --> 16:14.600
very official to me like it looked like especially something that would use aerial black like that

16:14.600 --> 16:19.120
that's just a very it just looked whipped up I don't know word I just yeah I don't know be a

16:19.120 --> 16:23.280
little bit you guys and maybe I'm wrong it may have been an official thing because it was whipped

16:23.280 --> 16:28.360
up quickly but I don't think there's anything wrong with you have a healthy healthy dose of

16:28.360 --> 16:32.840
skepticism with all this crazy amount of news that's coming out about you know the the COVID

16:32.840 --> 16:40.960
and all that yeah so here's they have they did send out a letter to from the CEO George Sherman

16:40.960 --> 16:46.840
sent out to all of the associates basically saying that effective immediately we've implemented the

16:46.840 --> 16:51.440
following for hourly associates that work at source that close or close in the future as a

16:51.520 --> 16:57.720
result of COVID-19 any associate directly impacted by COVID-19 at work is required to quarantine

16:57.720 --> 17:04.800
hourly employees who are paid time or have PTO are eligible will receive 80 hours of additional

17:04.800 --> 17:11.800
PTO in the event that you're not to PTO eligible you'll be paying for we will be paying you for two

17:11.800 --> 17:16.720
additional weeks of base pay calculated by the weekly average number hours you work in addition

17:16.720 --> 17:21.000
if your full-time benefit eligible employee will be receiving reimbursement for one month

17:21.000 --> 17:27.000
of employee benefit contributions for the month of April so at least that's something yeah a little

17:27.000 --> 17:32.160
after like dragging them through the street screaming I mean we'll give them we'll give them

17:32.160 --> 17:38.960
light snaps on a little light snaps and and still you know question some of the decisions I do want

17:38.960 --> 17:44.160
to address what's the discussion happening in the chat room because Tiger Claw is mentioning I posted

17:44.160 --> 17:47.920
a screenshot of the notice and has a picture of the notice but you know respectfully Tiger Claw

17:48.000 --> 17:51.680
I realize that's what a lot of people are looking at because I saw the reddit post and everything

17:51.680 --> 17:56.120
but I actually question that thing's legitimacy and I'm gonna tell you what it is for me there's

17:56.120 --> 18:01.920
no wet signature on that and that means that it's been signed I would think any type of actual order

18:01.920 --> 18:05.840
to close a business I'm pretty much sure anytime I've ever seen that posted in the window has a

18:05.840 --> 18:14.840
signature from either a sheriff who served it or a judge or the county's like there's no signature

18:14.840 --> 18:19.400
on there and I'm sorry that's again a healthy dose of skepticism I'm not necessarily saying it's all

18:19.400 --> 18:24.480
bullshit but then Bobby says there's literally no official news sources that say Pennsylvania

18:24.480 --> 18:29.720
revoked their business license the governor of Pennsylvania did have harsh words but did not

18:29.720 --> 18:36.240
take that action and so yeah so I actually I don't think a GameStop was officially closed now did an

18:36.240 --> 18:42.080
employee now I'm not saying the sign didn't exist because did an employee whip up that sign because

18:42.120 --> 18:47.240
they didn't want to go to work that day and felt unsafe there but possibly there's a lot

18:47.240 --> 18:53.680
of that's absolutely possible but there's a lot of explanations out there not necessarily the one

18:53.680 --> 19:00.080
that read it's telling you and I think keep that in mind and it's it's very easy to fall for these

19:00.080 --> 19:05.200
types of things in this day and age on the internet the other one I'm hearing is not true and I haven't

19:05.200 --> 19:09.960
done my own research on this but you know there's the stories going around about how the Venice

19:09.960 --> 19:15.800
canals like dolphins and fish are swimming in the canal apparently that one's not true and so

19:15.800 --> 19:23.680
interesting so just be careful about all the news that goes around right now it's a tricky time you

19:23.680 --> 19:29.920
know there should always be a way to like double source something if you're seeing it from one

19:29.920 --> 19:34.200
source hmm especially if that source is read it if you've seen it from two sources especially if

19:34.200 --> 19:40.560
one of them is CNN NBC CBS heck Fox I'll allow it when it comes to figuring out if something's

19:40.560 --> 19:47.880
legitimate or not in a double validation sort of thing double validate it that's all I'm saying so

19:47.880 --> 19:56.680
anyway okay and yeah some folks are saying s200 Matt says no state source would recommend people

19:56.680 --> 20:01.120
wear and n95 masks are telling people not to buy those masks because there's a shortage and

20:01.240 --> 20:08.880
healthcare people need those yeah so anyway just I'm gonna throw in something yeah just because I

20:08.880 --> 20:13.280
used to do property inspections for commercial properties oh yeah back in the day I remember

20:13.280 --> 20:19.240
that yeah that sign really isn't too far-fetched to me first of all a lot of those offices are not

20:19.240 --> 20:26.400
on max the standard font is aerial at least a lot of them have an upgraded computers and things like

20:26.400 --> 20:35.560
that what does give me a little bit of pause is that the way the the extra text on it and on top

20:35.560 --> 20:42.200
of that the fact that it looks like it's cut off but those actually are fairly in line with

20:42.200 --> 20:51.600
condemnation images like that I linked one from the city of Baltimore now there's are in like a

20:51.600 --> 20:58.280
bright yellow I have seen them in white I have seen them just a piece but just a letter written

20:58.280 --> 21:07.600
on business head it really is going to vary from place to place and I am suspect of it simply

21:07.600 --> 21:15.720
because it is cut off at the bottom I would have expected to have had like you know a professional

21:15.720 --> 21:21.920
letter something on cardstock too or at least a heavy paper but I'm not saying I'm I'm saying

21:21.920 --> 21:29.880
that font typography choice what have you that actually is not far-fetched but no no signature

21:29.880 --> 21:33.960
required that's the thing that's hanging me up I've seen some that have signatures I've seen

21:33.960 --> 21:41.440
others that don't a lot of them will have like contact you know X for for that and but usually

21:41.600 --> 21:46.600
they will say let me go back and look at it the biggest thing that they're gonna say is

21:46.600 --> 21:56.880
the nature of the closure this doesn't give any of it and again with that being cut off it actually

21:56.880 --> 22:03.760
looks like it's more of a photocopy of something so those are the things that make me think it's

22:03.760 --> 22:08.440
not legitimate not necessarily how it's laid out all right analyzing the receipts with dark

22:08.440 --> 22:20.880
Sakura you should seriously consider I mean now is the time to start thinking about those side

22:20.880 --> 22:24.360
projects and podcasts you always wanted to do because all of us have a lot of free time all

22:24.360 --> 22:28.680
of a sudden you should I would love to see you do a show called like analyzing the receipts where

22:28.680 --> 22:33.360
you take like big reddit stories and Facebook shares and try to figure out if they're BS or

22:33.360 --> 22:38.280
not although I suppose that's kind of like double double doing what Snopes does but you know I don't

22:39.120 --> 22:42.440
think Snopes has the time for this type of thing like they don't care about this one little Game

22:42.440 --> 22:48.760
Stop in Pennsylvania actually funny that you mentioned that Snopes has a big letter on their

22:48.760 --> 22:54.080
main page looking for a donation so they can keep up what they're doing because they've been

22:54.080 --> 23:04.760
inundated with so I would say people can help Snopes out this is a really important time for

23:04.760 --> 23:10.040
us to make sure we have factual information going out and this isn't the time to be posting

23:10.040 --> 23:17.240
stuff oh well it was funny or oh it sounded like it could have been right fact check every fucking

23:17.240 --> 23:23.800
thing before you post it because lives depend on yeah be very careful right now in social media

23:23.800 --> 23:31.120
there's so much there's so much going around all right I will absolutely call you out Loki we we

23:31.120 --> 23:33.840
we've got off base a little bit I don't know if there was anything else you want to add to the

23:33.880 --> 23:40.000
GameStop saga no that's pretty much it they said that the stores that are gonna remain open which

23:40.000 --> 23:47.840
I can't imagine that's gonna be for very long are doing my guess I guess you can pick up at the door

23:47.840 --> 23:54.080
type of stuff where you can order through the app I mean do people really need physical games that

23:54.080 --> 23:59.960
badly I don't know well Bobby shared a story about Animal Crossing and how you can't share

23:59.960 --> 24:04.160
a digital copy so if him and his wife will both want to play it makes more sense for them to have

24:04.160 --> 24:09.080
a physical copy so like I kind of get those types of scenarios and you know I I we've talked we've

24:09.080 --> 24:13.200
had the digital versus physical debate here on this show before some people just prefer to have

24:13.200 --> 24:17.880
something tangible that they can eventually sell back since you know GameStop is kind of in that

24:17.880 --> 24:24.440
business but long story short the the whole drive up solution I think is is a fair compromise and

24:24.440 --> 24:29.280
probably what should have been implemented in the first place interestingly enough they're not the

24:29.280 --> 24:32.520
only business to be doing something like that I believe Best Buy is starting something like that

24:32.520 --> 24:38.600
very soon which you know now even more so with Best Buy yes I could see where Best Buy is very

24:38.600 --> 24:43.200
important right now with so many people or in stores like it I don't want to give them free

24:43.200 --> 24:47.600
advertising but electronic stores will say in general because with so many people working from

24:47.600 --> 24:53.800
home you have what if what if a monitor goes bad what if a power cord or you got to replace a surge

24:53.800 --> 24:58.160
protector things like that that makes a lot more sense you got to drive up and and to be fair

24:58.200 --> 25:04.120
GameStop has a limited amount but they do have some of those things I guess so what if I don't

25:04.120 --> 25:09.640
have my Funko pops and they can't work but yeah the one of my desk just fell over but anyway um

25:09.640 --> 25:14.320
yeah like the drive-up thing makes a lot more sense um Allen actually just went out to get

25:14.320 --> 25:20.920
pet food because not only do we have to eat but mr. smoosh has to eat and mr. smoosh because if

25:20.920 --> 25:24.240
you guys have seen him which if you watch live on twitch he's always there at the beginning of the

25:24.240 --> 25:29.840
show you see that his face is smoosh it's actually not why we call him that we call him mr. smoosh

25:29.840 --> 25:33.760
because when you put out your hand for him to like lick your finger or something he will just ram

25:33.760 --> 25:37.720
his whole face into your hand he smooshes his face in your hands that's why we call mr. smoosh

25:37.720 --> 25:43.000
but he does have a smoosh face so he doesn't really have much of a nose so we have to buy a

25:43.000 --> 25:48.400
very specific type of pet food for him that is very smelly we have to buy like very smelly fish

25:48.640 --> 25:54.560
cat food or else he doesn't know he doesn't recognize that it's food really so we go to

25:54.560 --> 26:00.200
a specialty pet food store and that's what they do he Allen drives up in the car basically and

26:00.200 --> 26:06.800
I think he did walk up to a table and they went in the store got it brought it out rung it up

26:06.800 --> 26:13.160
hand sanitizer for both of them right outside and on to the next person that comes up so this whole

26:13.160 --> 26:18.040
concept of like drive up get what you need and leave is being implemented in other places as

26:18.200 --> 26:28.280
well not just what what GameStop's got going on also things to point out here Bobby Blackwell

26:28.280 --> 26:33.560
pointing out Best Buy also sells kitchen appliances so they're a little more essential I didn't think

26:33.560 --> 26:37.080
about that what if I mean what if the fridge breaks down during this whole thing or the

26:37.080 --> 26:41.720
freezer you know you got you got to worry about that but they aren't doing in-home delivery of

26:41.720 --> 26:46.080
those appliances they'll drop the new fridge at your front door and tell you good luck yikes

26:46.800 --> 26:51.240
that's gonna make it a little more difficult but nothing a good old YouTube search can't solve

26:51.240 --> 26:57.320
hopefully when it comes to installing anything you can find it on YouTube somewhere I'm sure so

26:57.320 --> 27:04.080
anyway yeah lots of lots of crazy changes that are gonna be happening and you know crossing our

27:04.080 --> 27:10.680
fingers and toes that we're talking about weeks and not months but be prepared for anything the

27:10.680 --> 27:16.520
official statement is eight to ten weeks yeah it could it could be some time so and we're seeing

27:16.520 --> 27:21.920
a lot of stuff as far out as May getting cancelled even some June I mean we know about e3 and so

27:21.920 --> 27:31.120
forth but I just saw today Portland retro Expo got cancelled and they were in I actually think

27:31.120 --> 27:36.400
I feel like they're all the way out in like July or August but they're more concerned about well

27:36.520 --> 27:42.800
they can't predict the future and what's gonna go on but also be just the fact that you know with

27:42.800 --> 27:48.280
all this going on the economic impact of the small businesses that the retro convention tends to you

27:48.280 --> 27:52.600
know attract and things like that like it's just so hard to know so there's there's events all

27:52.600 --> 27:56.760
summer that are starting to get cancelled dark soccer you post on Facebook the California

27:56.760 --> 28:00.760
pinball thing got cancelled too and that was during the summer right Golden State pinball

28:00.760 --> 28:08.880
it's in May and actually I was just I saw something go up that says a bay is considering

28:08.880 --> 28:16.240
postponing the Olympics in Japan yeah so that's tragic Jamie I mean where are you gonna go to play

28:16.240 --> 28:27.960
pinball now that still but also some of the events for the sisters were cancelled our Easter thing

28:28.360 --> 28:36.960
well they said postponed pride and I think LA is getting no not la Placerville I think one of them

28:36.960 --> 28:42.960
is getting you're right la la is got cancelled straight out a couple other places I have moved

28:42.960 --> 28:50.640
there so August Davis did Davis did that's it so yeah it's just a lot of a lot of stuff going on

28:50.640 --> 28:56.760
so you know fingers and toes crossed the Dragon Con still happens but I'm trying to mentally

28:56.840 --> 29:02.000
prepare myself for the fact that it might not but I'm trying to be optimistic and you know I know

29:02.000 --> 29:06.440
there's other optimistic folks out there so I'm trying to stay that weapon of just preparing

29:06.440 --> 29:10.880
myself for that possibility is you know it just might be the case we were gonna be doing a live

29:10.880 --> 29:15.720
showing of clue in April obviously that got pushed back it got pushed back to June I'm getting

29:15.720 --> 29:21.640
worried it's gonna get pushed back again but if that's what it takes to save people especially

29:21.640 --> 29:27.640
elderly folks and so forth then it's it's what we got to do so all right well one thing I'm

29:27.640 --> 29:32.720
sure we're all doing right now in this time is playing a lot of video games to get by so let's

29:32.720 --> 29:36.280
talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week and we'll

29:36.280 --> 29:41.120
start with dark soccer as if I had any question whatsoever as to what she's been playing this

29:41.120 --> 29:49.840
week sorry I've been muting my mic as I have to cough a lot no you're fine well it's been

29:49.840 --> 29:55.880
Animal Crossing I keep forgetting to look at pocket camp even I might even just quit playing

29:55.880 --> 30:08.000
it but I am really enjoying New Horizons I am on my third loan starting tomorrow and I should be

30:08.000 --> 30:15.960
able to save up everything to pay it off tonight I I've already recruited new new villagers to move

30:15.960 --> 30:23.600
in a place their houses and actually trying to get furniture for one of the houses now it adds a lot

30:23.600 --> 30:29.720
more to the game I think with all of these kind of fetch quest II things if that makes sense sure

30:29.720 --> 30:37.320
but but I streamed my first day playing I finally got my audio to work for one whole stream I joined

30:37.360 --> 30:45.920
your stream justice you were saying good night I ended up just being really really exhausted and

30:45.920 --> 30:51.280
it was I was sitting in a folding chair because it's kind of a crappy setup I have where I had

30:51.280 --> 30:56.440
my MacBook with that elgato plugged into it but for some reason the switch doesn't do the output

30:56.440 --> 31:07.040
to TV and to my Mac at the same time so I'm only getting audio on on the capture HD app so up to

31:07.040 --> 31:12.440
date everything I've done all my troubleshooting OBS doesn't work with it at all hmm yeah so I

31:12.440 --> 31:17.320
haven't it just doesn't even detect the the card and I've done of course all the troubleshooting I

31:17.320 --> 31:25.520
have no excuse not to know how to do it so if it happens again I might have to rethink how I'm

31:25.520 --> 31:37.480
doing it but yeah I played how many I started it at 9 and played until 3 a.m. and then yesterday

31:37.480 --> 31:44.800
I played for 10 hours no Friday I paid played for 10 hours yesterday I played for about six

31:44.800 --> 31:51.240
hours but I started getting so ill that I had to lay down and today I played for a couple and then

31:51.240 --> 31:56.200
I took a nap and now I'm doing the show wow you're making me you're making me look like a filthy

31:56.200 --> 32:00.360
casual I haven't even opened the game yet today I'm supposed to I'm supposed to get my museum

32:00.360 --> 32:06.680
finally today I'm so behind like I haven't even found the nuggets to get the store yet I should

32:06.680 --> 32:10.880
have them tonight if I play if I play a little bit after the show which I probably will I should

32:10.880 --> 32:20.960
have the nuggets tonight are you going to the the island I went to one island but I was saving my

32:21.000 --> 32:27.920
nook points to get the inventory expansion and the tool the tool act the circular tool access thing

32:27.920 --> 32:35.120
because those sounded very important and then I just barely got another 2,000 miles but I was like

32:35.120 --> 32:40.000
oh I should save these because maybe when I pay off the loan it's gonna open up even more inventory

32:40.000 --> 32:45.600
space or something but keep in mind by opening the museum and all the other things you get many

32:45.600 --> 32:50.560
many more nook miles I've been spending them like like they're going out of like they're

32:50.560 --> 32:58.640
going out of fashion okay and I still have 13,000 look miles right now so what do you think of the

32:58.640 --> 33:03.800
new Animal Crossing game compared to the old ones this one has a lot more to do with it by the way

33:03.800 --> 33:10.880
let me continue one other thing sorry get your first get your first loan oh yeah already work

33:10.880 --> 33:18.040
I already have the house okay good because what you get those extra five items on top of your nook

33:18.040 --> 33:26.120
miles app yeah those give you miles like for doing basic shit yeah the little dailies I call

33:26.120 --> 33:31.800
them dailies even though they just kind of keep going but yeah I've cycled through 30 of them in

33:31.800 --> 33:37.160
a day but that if this is one of the new things that this new Animal Crossing game kind of brings

33:37.160 --> 33:41.800
in that the old ones didn't have is that you have like these you know daily quests but then

33:41.800 --> 33:46.640
once you finish them little other short quests kind of pop in so this was a mechanism and you

33:46.640 --> 33:51.320
get these nook miles which are not the same thing as currency but you can use them to get either the

33:51.320 --> 33:55.280
trips to the random island or I think they have like hairstyles shirts there's certain things that

33:55.280 --> 34:01.040
are tied I've unlocked all the hairstyles half the clothes are ugly but I did get a leaf rug

34:01.040 --> 34:11.960
and I got the umbrella I you also if you check the terminal every day you get nook miles if you

34:11.960 --> 34:18.840
you also every so often get achievements for just buying regular stuff so the the store changes

34:18.840 --> 34:26.440
daily not just with Tommy but in the the kiosk and did you find where to buy the other recipes

34:26.440 --> 34:34.040
from Tommy I think which which recipes if you talk to him to buy something you hit your R trigger

34:34.040 --> 34:42.880
and it gives you another thing to buy like basic items yeah I think I did get that medicine yeah

34:42.880 --> 34:50.640
I'm just gonna tell you also save up three wasp nests so you can make a flooring later on the

34:50.640 --> 34:55.840
other advantage of going to the islands is that almost everyone that I've been to had a message

34:55.840 --> 35:02.560
in a bottle with the new DIY okay yeah the one the one I went to had a new person that wanted to

35:02.560 --> 35:07.880
move to my island and I was like okay which by the way I love my default villagers they're so

35:07.880 --> 35:14.280
great I got like the perfect I got one oh did you know school I got Agnes and I got Dom Agnes

35:14.280 --> 35:19.480
is the black pig and Dom is this like Ram that wears a rainbow shirt and talks about his muscles

35:19.480 --> 35:26.480
all the time nice and I got on one of the islands I'm getting chevra who I like one of my favorite

35:26.480 --> 35:35.080
are the goats and the guy can't remember his name he's the takoyaki head guy that looks like takoyaki

35:35.080 --> 35:42.040
oh yeah and see Brad got BAM and cherry who are like two of my favorites but I need to get Dina

35:42.040 --> 35:48.240
I'm gonna order Dina when I can all right Dean is my resident lesbian anyway any other thoughts

35:48.280 --> 35:55.640
on that Animal Crossing for for now it really takes the formula and expands upon it and it

35:55.640 --> 36:01.920
really it it'd be like I've got to do what to get what but the busywork makes the time fly and gives

36:01.920 --> 36:09.160
you so much more to do it and Ed will die Brad I will hit him with my axe in his head until he dies

36:09.160 --> 36:16.680
by the way speaking of the axe I highly suggest if you make the full axe still keep a stone axe

36:16.680 --> 36:21.480
on hand because you can whack a tree three times with the stone axe and it won't fall over you

36:21.480 --> 36:26.160
whack it three times with a regular axe and that you'll lose the tree oh I didn't know that that's

36:26.160 --> 36:31.200
good to know I thought it'll give you two pieces of wood and then the tree will die so so state

36:31.200 --> 36:36.140
save yourself a stone axe I thought the only way to pull out the trees was to do the whole eat the

36:36.140 --> 36:39.800
fruit and use the shovel because one of the villagers taught me that trick or something you

36:39.800 --> 36:45.760
can pull it up but if you want to destroy it you cut it down and then dig up the root mmm

36:45.760 --> 36:52.120
interesting just like you know before and I'll tell you if you've eaten fruit and you just want

36:52.120 --> 36:58.160
to hit a rock without destroying it keep keep a wood shovel you can no but you can also if you

36:58.160 --> 37:03.400
eat the fruit and use the shovel on a tree you dig up the entire tree right but I'm talking about

37:03.400 --> 37:10.080
the rocks if you're stuff out of it yeah and you've eaten fruit do not use your regular shovel

37:10.520 --> 37:17.120
do not use it use use a wood shovel and Bobby says you can replant that tree that's what I

37:17.120 --> 37:22.120
used to do in my old villages is I would take you can replant your rocks I would take all the the

37:22.120 --> 37:26.160
regular trees and replace them with fruit trees but I'm not sure if that's the smartest idea now

37:26.160 --> 37:29.680
because you actually need like wood and things like that for that come from the regular trees

37:29.680 --> 37:35.360
so I don't know if that's the fruit trees will give you wood too oh that's good okay but still

37:35.400 --> 37:42.520
there are so many trees in game and I actually super like them so the only one now if you hit

37:42.520 --> 37:48.160
bamboo if you find an island with bamboo dig up your sprouts you know the little look like little

37:48.160 --> 37:54.640
dig spots around them and whack them with the with the stone axe and you'll get two different

37:54.640 --> 38:00.320
kinds of bamboo I don't have any crafting for them yet but you'll get different things just

38:00.320 --> 38:05.840
stockpile and when you get your house you'll get storage and just stockpile everything don't throw

38:05.840 --> 38:13.120
away your cans don't throw away your tires don't throw away your boots yeah you know pansy buds

38:13.120 --> 38:16.960
right now talking about all this crafting and everything I think one thing that's important

38:16.960 --> 38:22.200
to point out about this Animal Crossing that I think kind of makes it you know a good one is

38:22.200 --> 38:26.360
that it's for all the criticism the Animal Crossing series gets of kind of being the same

38:26.360 --> 38:32.040
game over and over again I think this one really took the biggest step incrementally above the last

38:32.040 --> 38:36.560
game and I think it learned a lot from the popularity of things like Minecraft and Stardew

38:36.560 --> 38:41.440
Valley when it comes to things like crafting when it comes to being able to have the freedom to build

38:41.440 --> 38:45.480
things outside as well as inside I think it's kind of learned a lot from that and the game is showing

38:45.480 --> 38:52.040
a lot of strength because of that I think yeah no I really like that I've you know I liked putting

38:52.040 --> 38:59.080
you know bonfires outside I have my my big bonfire on one of the rocks and every time it gets

38:59.080 --> 39:06.440
Twilight I light it and then I hear from Dan Gondor calls for aid all right anything else to

39:06.440 --> 39:13.560
share about your gaming week Dark Saga okay Loki how about you how was your gaming week I've been

39:13.840 --> 39:22.800
mainly playing order that's pretty much it so I'm up to 162 I think and yeah it's just been doing

39:22.800 --> 39:28.640
lots of raids and all that fun stuff I think I played a little bit DDR earlier this week and

39:28.640 --> 39:35.400
that's pretty much a dig animal crossing have not played it yet my kids have played it and then my

39:35.400 --> 39:43.440
wife and my youngest son went back to play the 3ds Animal Crossing and then uh what else I've been

39:43.440 --> 39:49.500
looking to put step mania on my arcade cabinet since our DDR machine since I've got time to do

39:49.500 --> 39:55.120
that now and so I just was originally I wanted to create my own custom theme which I still probably

39:55.120 --> 39:59.720
will at some point but I just want to get something working now so I picked out a theme that looks okay

39:59.720 --> 40:04.400
and then I'm just gonna dump songs in it what but I've been fighting my computer the entire

40:04.400 --> 40:10.000
week because it just hasn't been working and keeps crashing so I had to reload windows which

40:10.000 --> 40:16.560
is a joy and I can't find all my step mania songs I downloaded all this stuff there's like tons of

40:16.560 --> 40:22.840
songs somewhere on my 5 terabyte drive and I can't find them so I have to dig those up or just redownload

40:22.840 --> 40:29.400
them because hey thank you Comcast taking away bandwidth caps right now so download away that's

40:29.400 --> 40:34.600
pretty much it late breaking news of sorts I'm looking in our chat room over twitch TV slash

40:34.600 --> 40:39.040
vog network and Bobby Blackwell says off topic but we just talked about this in a previous segment

40:39.040 --> 40:43.560
Canada about 15 minutes ago just announced they're not gonna participate in the Olympics if they are

40:43.560 --> 40:48.600
held so Canada's put their foot down and said move the damn Olympics basically and that's that

40:48.600 --> 40:52.520
that's probably gonna do the trick is I'm sure Canada will not be the only country to put their

40:52.520 --> 40:58.640
foot down and say move the damn Olympics you know because it's not just about the Olympics being in

40:58.640 --> 41:04.320
this summer but it's about all the qualifiers and things that have to lead up to the Olympics

41:04.320 --> 41:10.080
and so I think that's what the problem really ends up being is that you know we may be in a place you

41:10.080 --> 41:14.840
know come July or whenever the August I forget when the Olympics are where it might be okay to

41:14.840 --> 41:20.080
you know we don't have to worry as much about social distancing by then maybe but it's more

41:20.080 --> 41:24.560
like how are they gonna run the qualifiers because that stuff happens months before you picking who

41:24.560 --> 41:29.360
goes to the Olympics so very very interesting very interesting update and of course there's

41:29.360 --> 41:35.920
always video game tie-ins for the Olympics so if the Olympics get pushed to 2021 you'll still have

41:35.920 --> 41:40.480
Mario and Sonic at the Olympics 2020 out there somewhere it's very interesting are they gonna

41:40.480 --> 41:46.920
play Mario and Sonic at the Olympics on the Ocho like they're doing today possibly possibly anyway

41:46.920 --> 41:54.000
I also see DJ Orwell is in chat reminding us half-life Alex is out very soon in 15 hours so

41:54.000 --> 41:58.160
I think there's gonna be a lot of people at least VR enabled people that are really looking forward

41:58.160 --> 42:04.840
to that this week I know that's a big big game for all the talk about Doom Eternal and Animal

42:04.840 --> 42:08.120
Crossing kind of being the big launches this weekend you know it's still within the same

42:08.120 --> 42:13.120
seven-day period as half a new half-life game which is a really big deal as well so I'm really

42:13.120 --> 42:17.760
looking forward to seeing what the reaction is to that and how people are enjoying that I don't

42:17.760 --> 42:22.080
really have the VR set up to be able to enjoy it myself but I can't wait to live vicariously

42:22.160 --> 42:27.880
through others and see if it's maybe something I need to get into for my sometimes half-life

42:27.880 --> 42:32.720
obsessed husband we'll see I'll probably have to pick it up just to put it in my backlog to never

42:32.720 --> 42:38.080
play like the rest of my scene games now Johnny Wolf a in chat is talking about his gaming week

42:38.080 --> 42:45.800
consisting of doom 64 and doom eternal and I gotta say unfortunately I I picked up Animal Crossing I

42:45.800 --> 42:49.640
did not pick up doom eternal just because I didn't really want to drop the big money on that right

42:49.640 --> 42:53.760
now although I didn't even think to maybe go back and get doom 64 so maybe I will but I don't know

42:53.760 --> 43:01.600
um but I was watching our pal Charles over at giant-sized team up was doing a stream the other

43:01.600 --> 43:07.440
day of doom eternal and so I was just kind of watching him play it and it does look like fun

43:07.440 --> 43:14.920
I got it I gotta say and I really enjoyed the doom reboot that they did in 2016 I think so like I

43:14.960 --> 43:21.120
want to get doom at some point but I I just didn't feel the need to get it right away like I feel

43:21.120 --> 43:27.880
like I can maybe wait till like a Black Friday sale type of situation but we'll see so but the

43:27.880 --> 43:32.480
other thing I'll say about first-person shooters so as we get into my gaming week so a game that I

43:32.480 --> 43:37.600
actually played this week and I swear I didn't do this just to get dark soccer to make a noise I

43:37.640 --> 43:46.280
played Halo this week legit here's why you better be glad I'm muted here's why here's what yeah I

43:46.280 --> 43:51.400
can't hear your eyes rolling when you're muted no but the reality is is that um speaking of doom

43:51.400 --> 43:59.320
2016 I was on Xbox game pass because like Loki I'm thinking about oh we have all this bandwidth now

43:59.320 --> 44:04.040
and especially you know I'm not gonna suck down all the bandwidth during the hours that people are

44:04.040 --> 44:09.960
trying to work but on a Saturday night or something I might oh let my Xbox one run those

44:09.960 --> 44:16.400
90 gigabytes of updates it's been needing to do for about a year now which I did let it do and I

44:16.400 --> 44:21.240
started to kind of look around like what else can I download and doom 2016 was on Xbox game pass I

44:21.240 --> 44:25.640
noticed and then I saw a halo the Master Chief collection that reminded me oh I have that on PC

44:25.640 --> 44:33.160
and I think they added halo one into that on PC and sure enough they did so I played halo within

44:33.160 --> 44:40.440
the Master Chief collection on PC thanks to game pass and yeah it looks it looks really nice and I

44:40.440 --> 44:44.200
love playing those games with mouse and keyboard as opposed to controller I mean I like controller

44:44.200 --> 44:48.800
but mouse and keyboard feels really good as well and I really like one thing I do really like about

44:48.800 --> 44:55.480
halo in that collection is that all you have to do is hit the tab key and it switches between

44:55.480 --> 45:02.000
old-school graphics and new-school graphics like without any loading time so it's really kind of

45:02.000 --> 45:08.040
interesting to be like no filter filter no and the the difference is pretty stunning actually so

45:08.040 --> 45:12.040
that was like a weird kind of thing I was kind of playing with and I thought was interesting taking

45:12.040 --> 45:17.440
advantage of you know the Xbox game pass since I have that other games I've checked out this week

45:17.440 --> 45:22.720
Animal Crossing of course I don't need to double repeat a lot of what dark soccer has said and

45:22.720 --> 45:27.080
because I kind of inserted my own opinion while she was talking about that but I am enjoying it

45:27.080 --> 45:33.000
I think it is a big step up compared to the previous games and I I think it's a great thing

45:33.000 --> 45:40.680
to have come out right now like unintentionally so like with this irritated as everyone got remember

45:40.680 --> 45:45.000
when you were all mad that Animal Crossing got delayed now it's one of those things where it's

45:45.000 --> 45:50.280
like secretly I'm with the state of everything that's going on in the world I'm kind of glad it

45:50.280 --> 45:57.000
happened now like we needed that game this weekend so that's really great other games

45:57.000 --> 46:01.920
that I've been checking out this week I I randomly got back into Diablo 3 I think I talked a little

46:01.920 --> 46:05.960
bit about that last week and I've been playing my seasonal character still continuing on in Final

46:05.960 --> 46:10.880
Fantasy 14 because of course the game I haven't really touched this weekend which surprises me

46:10.880 --> 46:19.640
PSO 2 is in open beta right now and I just haven't jumped on to play it yet I think because with the

46:19.640 --> 46:24.560
closed beta it was like you have this weekend to play it and you got to get all this stuff done or

46:24.560 --> 46:28.680
you're not gonna get your Dreamcast mag I was like oh I got a Russian and do it but now with the open

46:28.680 --> 46:34.240
beta it's like it's running for like two weeks so I'm like oh I I don't really feel the need to rush

46:34.240 --> 46:38.600
in there and do the open beta I'll get around to it when I get around to it so that's kind of been

46:38.600 --> 46:45.400
my attitude with that on Xbox plus I just updated everything on my Xbox including the PSO client the

46:45.400 --> 46:52.520
other night so that is that is something Bobby Black Wolf says I forgot to talk about PSO 2 on

46:52.520 --> 46:57.200
my show they haven't given me my Dreamcast mag yet I don't think we were supposed to get that

46:57.200 --> 47:01.120
until the game officially launches so I don't think that's supposed to show up until the actual

47:01.120 --> 47:06.080
launch of the game which I still don't think they've dated actually but we'll probably know

47:06.080 --> 47:11.480
a little more on that soon so anyway that was my gaming week let's move on and get into some of the

47:11.480 --> 47:17.560
news what's going on in the gaming world this week so Loki you want to start us off sure so

47:17.560 --> 47:27.280
thankfully this week we had Mark Cerny coming to us from the spaceship of love to reveal the

47:27.280 --> 47:37.400
PlayStation 5 tech specs so I have some information on those so of course a very similar wise or spec

47:37.480 --> 47:44.960
wise to I would say the Xbox Series X of course there were a little bit of differences and they

47:44.960 --> 47:52.360
kind of went into some really big details regarding that some of the cool stuff that they were talking

47:52.360 --> 47:59.400
about where the fact that with that new SSD that there's going to be very little load time talking

47:59.400 --> 48:04.920
about how they're gonna be like deduping the data on there because originally because of the load

48:04.920 --> 48:09.800
speeds and where you had your data on the disk it might take longer to access some of that so there

48:09.800 --> 48:16.240
was a little bit of duplication to be able to access certain assets on there but kind of overall

48:16.240 --> 48:23.640
you know it's gonna be an eight cores into custom CPU they're gonna have the rDNA 2 GPU as well

48:23.640 --> 48:30.120
which is kind of similar the PlayStation 5 supposed to run at 3.5 gigahertz and then the GPU pushes a

48:30.240 --> 48:35.960
few more teraflops of course he basically said that hey listen you know the teraflops are gonna

48:35.960 --> 48:40.680
be a little bit different than what you might see with like an a PC or an Xbox Series X or whatever

48:40.680 --> 48:49.440
just based on the custom architecture you know 16 gigabytes is GDDR6 and the internal storage

48:49.440 --> 48:55.960
which is kind of weird it's kind of not really a round number but 825 gigabytes SSD it's m.2

48:55.960 --> 49:06.720
NVMe but that is expandable with your own SSDs as well but they're gonna be benchmarking certain

49:06.720 --> 49:11.440
ones that are gonna be compatible because of the speed of the system they need to make sure that

49:11.440 --> 49:17.880
those SSDs are gonna be fast enough to be able to do what they needed to do for the PlayStation 5

49:17.880 --> 49:23.360
so it was interesting very technical talk obviously something that was supposed to be done during GDC

49:23.360 --> 49:32.240
the filming of it with the silhouette so it was a little ms3 3k but I don't know that was odd

49:32.240 --> 49:37.960
was interesting yeah yes I kept wondering like I'm like is that like is that real or is that like

49:37.960 --> 49:43.240
just like an animated thing it would have been funnier if they were like Sony characters like

49:43.240 --> 49:48.640
Oh Nathan Drake is there and Kratos and why is randomly Parappa the Rappa and like all these

49:48.640 --> 49:54.080
really odd silhouettes that would have been funny but it was supposed to be a serious talk so you

49:54.080 --> 50:00.440
know because clearly it was their GDC talk very clearly it was very interesting to see how again

50:00.440 --> 50:05.280
the media kind of hype things up and I'm talking you know as much as I praise and I talk about the

50:05.280 --> 50:11.320
independent media this one's kind of on the indie media I think really read way too much into Sony's

50:11.320 --> 50:16.720
original tweet and blog announcement because I saw these posts going around about big PlayStation

50:16.720 --> 50:22.800
5 reveal tomorrow and you know who's most guilty of this and I'm calling you out is the youtubers

50:22.800 --> 50:28.960
some youtubers not all youtubers but some youtubers were like all big PS 5 reveal event

50:28.960 --> 50:34.760
predictions big games being announced tomorrow my game predictions for the PS 5 event y'all

50:34.760 --> 50:42.200
fucked up you need to not like put your expectations on the reality of what Sony is saying

50:42.200 --> 50:48.200
because that stuff just makes for videos I mean come on it's just it's clickbait set but yeah I

50:48.200 --> 50:53.240
get it we all need to be like like and we need like I'm not saying we need to bully people or

50:53.240 --> 50:59.200
but we need to say hey you made a mistake and set the expectations way too high you need to be

50:59.200 --> 51:03.200
careful about that next time and that's all you know I'm not saying shut them down or anything

51:03.200 --> 51:06.560
like that I'm not saying that I'm just saying like you got a little egg on your face if you

51:06.560 --> 51:14.440
you you know if you were expecting games games games Sony never said games and y'all have to

51:14.440 --> 51:18.900
really like and you can't and again it goes back to what we're talking about earlier in the the

51:18.900 --> 51:24.440
show like the whole double sourcing thing if one source is telling you that fine but if if the

51:24.440 --> 51:29.960
source says according to a PlayStation tweet that it uh which how many of those sites that post

51:29.960 --> 51:36.200
things on Facebook how many of them are according to a tweet or according to an Instagram post

51:36.400 --> 51:41.480
that's like so much of what we see right now right so go back and read the tweet for yourself

51:41.480 --> 51:47.840
and see what they're really saying because that is all the article says is the 280 characters

51:47.840 --> 51:54.680
that's in that tweet and again Sony never said anything about games and so that's why I was not

51:54.680 --> 52:01.000
surprised whatsoever yeah I tuned into the talk and in the first 90 seconds Mark Cerny said we

52:01.000 --> 52:08.320
have all year to show you games so we'll show you games later and so at that exactly and it was

52:08.320 --> 52:12.520
interesting I was disappointed though because he talked about like oh yeah we're gonna have a tear

52:12.520 --> 52:18.360
down I was like ooh tear down and then they've never did it so that was kind of point one of the

52:18.360 --> 52:21.800
other things they kind of mentioned though because he was talking about backwards compatibility so

52:21.800 --> 52:25.160
that is definitely gonna be a focus this time around they were even talking about like game

52:25.160 --> 52:31.520
development wise they have the architecture for like the PlayStation 4 stuff available so that

52:31.520 --> 52:36.480
you're gonna have a lot of games that could even be built around that kind of architecture still

52:36.480 --> 52:43.200
on the PlayStation 5 they did promise he said that they're looking at the top most the one our most

52:43.200 --> 52:48.040
popular PlayStation 4 games they weren't aiming to make sure that those are backwards compatible but

52:48.040 --> 52:52.760
he says you know that we believe that the overwhelming majority of the 4,000 plus games

52:52.760 --> 53:00.080
on PlayStation 4 will be playable on PlayStation 5 so that's pretty cool that is awesome yeah a lot

53:00.080 --> 53:05.040
of people kind of reacted to that the thing in his talk about the 100 games but it's good to see

53:05.040 --> 53:08.960
that and that was a good thing for Sony to kind of step in and clarify because yeah the way it was

53:08.960 --> 53:13.520
worded in there I think a lot of people read into that that oh my gosh there's gonna be barely any

53:13.520 --> 53:18.840
game it's gonna be like the rollout of Xbox games on Xbox 360 you remember that where it was like a

53:19.000 --> 53:24.680
chunk of them every few months but it sounds like Sony is way ahead of that like when they put out

53:24.680 --> 53:29.480
their clarifying statement right yeah so it should be pretty good I think Xbox is gonna be in the

53:29.480 --> 53:35.320
same boat because they kind of I don't know I think it's gonna be very similar hardware going

53:35.320 --> 53:40.320
into it it will be interesting to see like all this stuff that they kind of talked about during

53:40.320 --> 53:45.840
this presentation how that's gonna make a difference and I mean it could make a difference at the end

53:45.880 --> 53:51.680
of the day it's gonna be the games so be just how these different developers utilize the hardware

53:51.680 --> 53:55.880
that they have this is definitely laying the foundation for that because now when they have

53:55.880 --> 54:00.080
their next thing they can talk a little more about games I mean it doesn't necessarily have to be

54:00.080 --> 54:05.600
their next thing but on down the road they can really focus on having an announcement that's

54:05.600 --> 54:13.400
just about the games you know one thing we should talk about with that GDC talk essentially that was

54:13.400 --> 54:18.160
repurposed for YouTube that Sony did we need to talk about Mark Cerny himself for a little bit

54:18.160 --> 54:22.480
because I know there were a lot of people on Twitter that were poking fun at him a little

54:22.480 --> 54:26.760
bit because he has a lot of mannerisms very similar to Dana Carvey he's very soft-spoken

54:26.760 --> 54:32.040
and so forth and so some people were kind of poking fun at that and so forth but um y'all

54:32.040 --> 54:37.920
better not forget and I forgot this until someone pointed it out on our discord that badass mother

54:37.920 --> 54:48.120
fucker Mark Cerny made marble madness when he was like 17 or 18 so don't you forget it so when

54:48.120 --> 54:53.000
you're teasing him saying he's like you know Dana Carvey's impressions or something don't forget he

54:53.000 --> 54:57.360
made marble madness which is one of the like that was that was one of the all-time most creative

54:57.360 --> 55:06.440
original arcade games it was a badass NES game as well so well where's my ray traced marble game

55:06.840 --> 55:12.440
for PlayStation 5 hey you never know you never know he's he's also contributed to other games

55:12.440 --> 55:16.680
and so forth but that was just like when somebody pointed that out and you kind of go look at the

55:16.680 --> 55:21.600
dude's resume it's like dang this guy made some big contributions to gaming and ended up kind of

55:21.600 --> 55:26.760
going to work for Sony on the hardware side like this guy like knows what he's doing because he's

55:26.760 --> 55:32.880
been in there programming games and so forth for a very long time and do it doing some of the

55:32.920 --> 55:39.880
all-time great games for sure Tiger Claw and chat says if they make a movie about Mark Cerny Dana

55:39.880 --> 55:46.320
Carvey should totally play him okay that I will allow that I will allow but let us let us not

55:46.320 --> 55:51.800
underestimate how powerful Mark Cerny is as some of his contributions to gaming all right anyway

55:51.800 --> 55:56.560
let's move on and talk a little bit about what happened in Nintendo's world this week Nintendo

55:56.560 --> 56:01.680
had an indie event so they did one of their indie directs or the indie world showcase if you will

56:01.680 --> 56:05.680
where they showed off some of the indie games that are coming to switch over the next couple

56:05.680 --> 56:12.600
months or things that were coming out today like exit the Gungeon now I think we knew this game was

56:12.600 --> 56:16.320
coming I want to say we had heard about this before but we didn't know it was gonna be the

56:16.320 --> 56:22.880
surprise drop on us as of today so exit there as of the day of the the event so exit the Gungeon

56:22.880 --> 56:28.840
another bullet-hell dungeon climber but it is following the events of enter the Gungeon so

56:28.840 --> 56:33.320
that's pretty cool Loki I don't know if you've had a chance to check out exit the Gungeon yet

56:33.320 --> 56:38.840
but I know you were a big fan of enter the Gungeon right I have not checked it out I think it was out

56:38.840 --> 56:45.960
on Apple Arcade already and then they're just porting it over to switch I don't know if it's

56:45.960 --> 56:53.760
out on PC that's right I think you're right about Apple Arcade yeah now another you know I gotta say

56:53.760 --> 56:57.640
there weren't a lot of like indie titles that we knew a lot about there weren't a lot of like big

56:57.680 --> 57:02.560
names that were really jumping out but I mean they're Indies so sometimes you don't know that

57:02.560 --> 57:08.400
an indie game is gonna really take over like you know Minecraft, Crypt of the Necrodancer,

57:08.400 --> 57:14.600
Five Nights at Freddy's they were all indie games too but I thought this was very interesting is

57:14.600 --> 57:20.480
that one of the game creators that showed up during this event was Hello Games and their

57:20.480 --> 57:26.520
contribution is a game called The Last Campfire Hello Games if you will recall is the studio

57:26.600 --> 57:33.760
behind No Man's Sky so it is kind of interesting after everything that that game No Man's Sky went

57:33.760 --> 57:38.880
through being a hugely hyped launch on the PlayStation 4 when essentially it was kind of

57:38.880 --> 57:46.240
an indie title they got a lot of AAA promotion treatment and so forth and then we saw how that

57:46.240 --> 57:50.400
went for them when the game first came out but again and I said this before if you haven't

57:50.400 --> 57:55.640
touched No Man's Sky since it first came out it's a completely different game now very similar to

57:55.800 --> 58:01.440
what Diablo 3 went through Final Fantasy 14 or Destiny 2 you know one of those games has been

58:01.440 --> 58:08.360
really transformed No Man's Sky is right up there so I think a lot of people were kind of wondering

58:08.360 --> 58:13.640
ooh what big sci-fi thing might Hello Games do next but it is interesting to note that now this

58:13.640 --> 58:20.760
indie studio Hello Games is doing an indie game but I'm looking forward to it because I love No

58:20.760 --> 58:27.720
Man's Sky so I'm curious to see what they do their game is called The Last Campfire and it's

58:27.720 --> 58:32.520
about a wilderness where there are strange creatures mysterious ruins and you are trying

58:32.520 --> 58:38.080
to light the last campfire it's a tale of magic and mystery and it's coming out for the Nintendo

58:38.080 --> 58:41.960
Switch this summer so some that was kind of the biggest surprise for me out of this was like oh

58:41.960 --> 58:47.080
Hello Games ready to show what they're working on next and it's a little bit more of a scaled back

58:47.080 --> 58:51.000
if you will indie title so I'm really excited to check that out on some other things that were

58:51.000 --> 58:58.040
announced at the Nintendo indie event Blue Fire from Robie Studios Baldo from Naps Team I Am Dead

58:58.040 --> 59:04.400
from Hollow Ponds which I was kind of like ooh I don't know if this is the most well-timed game

59:04.400 --> 59:09.040
announcement with all that's going on in the world but it does look like an interesting puzzle

59:09.040 --> 59:15.880
adventure game and so forth so that's that a game called Bee Ark or Bark where pugs cats bears and

59:15.880 --> 59:22.320
bunnies save the solar system sign me the fuck up that sounds awesome and I love the name Bee Ark

59:22.320 --> 59:29.960
bark cyanide and happiness Freakpocalypse part one so I'm assuming that's based on the comic

59:29.960 --> 59:35.640
so I love that series so I have to play it yeah so I'm sure yeah some folks will be really excited

59:35.640 --> 59:42.400
about that Summer in Mara from Chibig Quantum League from Nimble Giant Entertainment The Good

59:42.440 --> 59:50.560
Life from White Owls Inc pixel junk eat pixel junk Eden 2 from Q games Feria from abracam hope

59:50.560 --> 59:56.760
I said that right eldest souls from fallen flag studio moving out from SMG studio and sky racket

59:56.760 --> 01:00:05.380
from double dash studios all of that coming out in the next either some of them came out that sky

01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:08.960
racket actually just came out this week some of those other titles coming up throughout the

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:13.800
summer and so forth there's some other titles in there as well apparently Blair Witch from

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:18.560
bluebird another Blair Witch game from bluebird team coming out as well and so on many many more

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:26.120
and they also announced a new indie focus Twitter account that's pretty cool at indie world and a

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:33.000
IND IE world and a so pretty cool hopefully some of you guys looking to check out some of those

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.120
games quest buster and chat says exit the gungeon just came out but I don't think it's as well

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:44.200
received you know it's it it's a orange right says Oh exit the gungeon did seem familiar like

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:50.160
it was already announced I guess that's it yeah um it's you know and especially right now in the

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:54.480
world a lot of these games are kind of struggling to get noticed amongst everything else going on

01:00:54.480 --> 01:01:01.240
but I think as this new normal and I'm using my quote II fingers because it's hard to think of

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:06.120
this as normal but for the next eight to ten weeks or whatever it might be as this new normal kind of

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:11.880
settles in I think we'll kind of get used to these sorts of announcements and things so anyway

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:17.560
a different way of doing things moving on Dark Sakura of course you're gonna have an Animal

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:26.680
Crossing story right yeah I was actually a little surprised but uh there is a and I might have

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:35.800
talked about her before it was this 87 year old lady who had a 3500 plus hour Animal Crossing

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:43.960
town her grandson Paul posted this pic this video of her her name is Audrey she's showing off her

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:50.800
progress on the 3ds game on you leave she'd been playing every day for four years and of course

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:58.440
everyone loves her because she is everyone's Animal Crossing grandmother so it looks like

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:08.080
that they based a character in New Horizons off of her Audrey's nickname is Adi and so there's a

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:15.720
character in the game now called Adi who wears a cute little blue dress and shades and she's a

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:24.040
one of the foxy ones and looks like that's a tribute to this gaming grandmother I love

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:30.200
that props to Nintendo for doing that and maybe the little win games do that me too and you know

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:35.280
you got to respect your gaming grandmas keep in mind we're all self isolating right now so that

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:40.760
our gaming grandmas don't get sick you know it's a big it's a big part of it so has precious it must

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:45.920
be protected that's right she's precious do it hashtag do it for Audrey hashtag do it for Betty

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:52.880
White honestly we got any whites immortal we got to save the elderly you guys well did you see the

01:02:52.880 --> 01:03:04.360
PSA that went out by Max Brooks Mel Brooks's son who oh yeah I did see that he's like if he gets

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:13.560
sick then Dick Van Dyke and all these others and I was like yeah let's let's be nice and Bobby is

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:18.520
pointing out this whole thing is the localization team which I know sometimes localization team that

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:23.760
sneaks these types of things in here the Japanese name was something not directly translatable so

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:28.840
the US team named her Adi so that's a lot of the Japanese names are nothing that's directly

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:36.360
translatable yeah but I do like when there are nods to them like I hadn't seen captain but he

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:46.320
was clearly a kappa and Tom Nook would be for a tanuki yeah and just to make sure I didn't

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:51.280
misrepresent anything I want to make sure I'm very clear kovat does not only attack the elder

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:55.760
elderly they are the most vulnerable but we are self isolating to keep each other healthy as well

01:03:55.760 --> 01:04:02.080
because this can affect folks in their 40s like me 30s 50s you know we're doing it for each other

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:09.200
yeah I can absolutely big batch of people younger and that's why even if you know if it's just

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:16.440
pneumonia for me I still can't leave the house oh yeah because secondary infections are really

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:21.640
really bad news with that stuff absolutely it was kind of the other way around to remember when you

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:25.840
and I had swine flu all those years ago it seems like it was such a memory fucking no I had swine

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:30.240
flu yeah we didn't know till after that and and not to compare the two because these are very very

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:35.840
different things but the thing was swine flu and when even after I was diagnosed I felt fine I

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:43.280
still had to stay home for a week my doctor put me in quarantine for a week because I couldn't catch

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:48.240
anything secondary in the whole time and it was the whole time I thought oh she's isolating me she

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:51.800
doesn't want me to give it to my class because I was a corporate trainer at the time and I had a

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:57.680
class of 30 people no she didn't want the class getting me sick again because that was the

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:03.080
dangerous part and I think some of that is in play with kovat but again I don't I'm not a doctor

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:09.720
I don't misrepresent anything you don't want it it's not just the flu don't get it if you can

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:16.320
if you'll remember after I had swine flu I developed a nasty sinus infection and bronchitis

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:25.680
yeah remember I do so if I had known that I had that I would have stayed inside and not gone to

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:33.520
eat delicious matzo ball soup that made me feel better all right yeah back to all this we need to

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:41.440
protect our gaming grandmothers and the ones that we love and and honestly for everyone who's saying

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:48.440
boomer remover I wish you would seriously shut the fuck up these are our parents yeah that's all

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:54.960
and it's if you think this thing only targets based on age you need to like read a newspaper

01:05:54.960 --> 01:06:01.440
or like just literally listen to anything going on right now because we just had an a report of

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:07.080
somebody in their 30s in the Hollywood area who went to Disney World you know not again that's

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:10.280
the that's the dangerous thing about this like you might go oh my god why did he go to Disney

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:15.360
World because he wasn't he didn't he didn't feel sick he didn't look sick he would but he had it

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:19.440
and because this thing has an incubation period of 14 days he didn't know and he ended up passing

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:25.400
away from it it's really tragic so and I'll just tell people even it this is my last time even if

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:31.440
you're not under shelter in place even if you're just only in social distancing please act like

01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:38.920
you are under shelter in place please you will you'll be doing your part you'll be preventing

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:43.680
the spread I'm really surprised that bigger metropolitan areas there are still places in

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:51.120
this country that haven't enacted it don't go out like to buy planters or a video game in public or

01:06:51.120 --> 01:07:01.280
you know don't don't go to a bar or any of that the more you expose yourself the more other people

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:06.720
and Bobby Bobby black wolf is saying in chat too late because he openly admitted he went out and

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:12.000
got a video game this week but admittedly this is also a situation that's changing day by day like

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.840
the day you win it like even the night you went out to get the game things did not feel as dire

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:21.600
as they are day by day I was we're hearing more and more about like what this thing is really

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:28.000
doing so like you know we all probably thought we could take it a little bit lighter than it

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:34.080
really is at some point early on I'm sure we've all been guilty of that a little bit but yeah heck

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:39.280
I still went on my cruise you know what and I don't know luckily nobody on the shit you know

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:44.440
it's today is 14 days since the cruise and there's been no reports of COVID from the cruise so it was

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:48.920
everything was fine and dandy and so forth but I certainly make no apologies for that but you

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:55.520
know if that cruise had been just a week and a half later I don't think I would have gone so

01:07:55.520 --> 01:08:00.480
you know timing is really everything really really everything but honestly those airports were way

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:05.960
more filthy than the boat was just saying yeah who has that you know who has bad timing hmm my

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:10.720
husband for vacuuming while I can hear it through the door well we don't we don't hear it through

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:17.480
the on the station for what it's worth so all right anyhow let us move on Loki I think you're

01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:25.160
next yes that's true so we kind of knew this was gonna happen considering that a Sony made

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:30.080
the announcement last week or a medium alcohol I can't remember who was it you'd be able to soon

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:38.440
sell some of your creations that you make in dreams well you know all the videos I've seen

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:43.680
of dreams online have all benches recreations of other games or like all sorts of copyright

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:49.520
infringement stuff so of course there's a lot of Mario games out there and one of the creators

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:58.880
goes by the name of piece of craft he had made a Mario game in dreams as well and he's received

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:05.960
a copyright strike on the model which basically disallows that game that he made to be played by

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:10.440
others in dreams and so the similar type of stuff is happening with some of these other

01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:16.880
creations that utilize the models similar to that so definitely Nintendo is taking notice of these

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:22.480
Mario games that people are making in dreams so you're probably not going to be able to utilize

01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:27.800
a lot of those copyright materials I would assume that more this would happen with some of the other

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:33.320
creations out there because I've seen all sorts of mix-ups with like spongebob and Shrek and all

01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:37.600
the memes I mean it's really everything it's interesting you kind of talk about that because

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:41.200
and even Bobby's alluding to this in our chat right now over at twitch TV slash vog network

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:45.680
we're Bobby saying that's because the youtubers only focus on these creations there's a lot more

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:51.280
than that in a game and that's very true is that you know again it it gets more eyes and clicks

01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:56.040
and things when it's like lol it's a spongebob meme inside dreams you know that type of thing

01:09:56.040 --> 01:10:01.280
gets more clicks than hey here's this person's totally original presentation and how cool it is

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:06.160
heck I'm guilty of this as well when the very first little big planet game came out the very

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:11.720
first one what did I say was my favorite level the shrine to Parker Posey level is still to this

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:16.560
day my favorite thing I've ever seen in little big planet but it was kind of okay like it's

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:21.760
like ripping off all these publicity photos of her and things like that I'd like to think at

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:26.360
the time it was still kind of a new and novel thing but yeah I mean we got to realize that

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:35.160
dreams has a lot more in it than just the copyright stuff but that's the stuff that gets people's

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:41.640
attention when it's like oh somebody recreated doom inside dreams what like that gets people's

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:46.200
attention whereas you know yeah yeah I mean it's just amazing what you can do with the gaming yeah

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:52.200
I know there's a lot of other stuff out there but and hopefully you know that this will they'll go

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:58.120
through this and it was just be removed although I mean that's not to say that it made stuff will

01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:04.000
slip through I mean already the one of the other games that the guy made which was mario 64 HD in

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:10.920
dreams is still available to play without the model I guess and I know other games like roblox

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:15.640
and stuff like that I mean that's been around forever and there's all sorts of copyright

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:20.840
infringement stuff in there like I see my kids playing that and I'm just like how is that allowed

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:27.760
it's just it's people catching it so I'm sure this will be the end of it but at least people

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:32.560
can know that they are looking for it now and you know we've kind of talked about this phenomenon on

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:37.400
the show over the years many times you know whenever you have a game creation software

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:41.480
type of thing how long is and this we talked about this a little big planet first came out

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:46.480
we talked about this when Mario maker came out how long is it until someone recreates world one

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:52.640
one from Super Mario Brothers how long because I mean world one one is iconic because it's

01:11:52.640 --> 01:12:00.160
something that you recognize just based on that little formula of you know the little the line

01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:04.040
here and I'm using my I'm making motions for those that are on the podcast and where those

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:09.600
question mark blocks are located so I mean that that's level design games so strong in world one

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:15.120
one that like you recognize that even when it's being copied in other games just interesting so

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:23.560
one of those types of phenomenons so anyway alright um let's move on and talk about a game

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:28.840
that valve put out a little while ago called artifact and I think valve actually didn't valve

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:33.840
pull this game at some point or they they way scale back on artifact but apparently it may be

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:39.440
coming back because dota twos it was a dota 2 based game called artifact it's kind of it's

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:43.720
basically their version of hearthstone I mean I know I'm not supposed to say that but you know

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:47.880
let's be real hearthstone caught a lot of eyes a lot of people wanted a piece of the pot with

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:53.720
that valves one of them so artifact was kind of their response to that but they aren't updating

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:58.720
it anymore now okay so the game isn't dead it was the updates that they stopped doing sorry I will

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:04.880
I haven't been following the game myself personally but that's what's going on however edge magazine

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:10.920
has some inside sources that are saying valve is working on a follow-up internally it's being

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:15.360
called artifact tube that doesn't necessarily mean that's what it is could be an expansion could be

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:20.160
a new game could be something you know it could be anything Gabe Newell once referred to artifact

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:25.640
as an interesting failure they thought it was a strong product saying quote we ran an experiment

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:29.400
we got a negative result and now we need to see if we've learned anything from that so let's try

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:34.280
again and that's what the artifact team has been doing and what they're getting ready to release

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:39.080
based on the reaction to it what was wrong with the product how do we get there let's fix those

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:44.000
things and take another run at it of course no information on when that updates gonna come out

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:50.960
or the sequel or anything like that but they do say that more details will come out after half

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:57.520
life Alex launches which understandable valve is very focused on the half-life Alex thing right now

01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:03.160
so we'll know a little more information about whatever this artifact thing is at a later date

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:08.360
and if half-life Alex is successful then that gets more eyes on steam and a great place for them to

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:13.320
announce some more information about artifact whatever the future is for that so fifth dream

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:19.760
today in our chat says Wow cards dota cards low cards League of Legends cars guys come on well

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:25.200
it's you know and it doesn't stop there Elder Scrolls had their own game The Witcher did Gwent

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:33.400
as a standalone game you know a game when a game is extraordinarily popular like Hearthstone or if

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:37.960
you want to like Magic the Gathering and all the Magic the Gathering games on the computer everybody

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:41.960
wants a piece of that somehow how can we make a trading card game where we're not copying it

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:47.600
we're kind of putting our own spin on it and doing so I think that's one thing that everybody

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:54.080
wants a piece of I will say for what it's worth I think when a Hearthstone strengths is that it's

01:14:54.080 --> 01:15:00.720
very simplistic it's not a particularly difficult game to teach and I think the fact that Hearthstone

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:09.360
runs cross-platform very easily between tablets and phones completely agnostic a platform doesn't

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:18.280
matter if you're Apple Android what have you it sinks sinks that with PC so well I think that's a

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:24.040
huge asset for it that I'm not sure all of the other games have been able to copy as well so

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:30.200
food for thought anyway fifth dream today follows up and says I'm friends with people very involved

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:34.200
in some of the car games online like they work for the companies and streamers and wow it all

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:39.400
goes right over my head hype mayhem says to be honest I'm good with car games at the moment I'm

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:43.320
happy just playing my Magic the Gathering games on Steam yeah it's something it's like me and MMOs

01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:48.480
it's hard to play more than one quest buster says honestly surprised that artifact is getting a

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:53.800
second pass especially after what its twitch channel turned into but gotta give valve credit

01:15:53.800 --> 01:16:00.000
for trying well they believe in it and you know games it's not unheard of for games to get rebooted

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:05.920
successfully again Diablo 3 no man's sky we've gone down this road a million times this is what

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:12.760
happens with games now in this year 2020 so we'll see if valve has any luck with that meanwhile Dark

01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:21.000
Sakura what else do we have we have me trying to unmute my mic that's one of them no it's taking

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:27.320
some getting used to this new setup oh I hate this the site started playing everything automatically

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:31.720
it's not streaming through is it no we can't hear it we're only we're only hearing you well

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:38.040
it's playing I can't hear it just we're just hearing you we don't hear okay well it's bothering

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:43.320
me so I'll go ahead and try to read this while this is playing in the background oh there we go

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:49.680
sorry I found it I can't do both sounds at the same time it messes up my brain no you're fine

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:54.360
I don't know if Safari is like Chrome but there's like that using Safari I'm on a PC right now oh

01:16:54.720 --> 01:17:01.000
because Chrome has a little speaker icon you can click it and it'll shut shut it up yeah this it

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:09.600
doesn't do it for everything at any well done I have four browser windows open so at any rate

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:18.800
it was announced for the World Video Game Hall of Fame that they have their finalists up and ready

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:26.840
to go I have already done my voting so the games that are on the list this year are Bejeweled,

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:36.600
Centipede, Frogger, Goldeneye 007, Guitar Hero, King's Quest, Minecraft, NBA Jam, Nokia Snake,

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:42.360
Super Smash Brothers Melee, Uncharted 2 Among Thieves, and where in the world is Carmen Sand

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:48.400
Diego you don't know what I voted for can you only vote for one in that list I think you can

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:54.200
go back and vote but I just voted for one which one did you vote for where in the world is Carmen

01:17:54.200 --> 01:18:04.240
Sand Diego that's a good one if I were to vote in that poll ooh that's a tricky one Bejeweled,

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:08.400
Centipede, Frogger, Goldeneye, Guitar Hero, King's Quest, Minecraft, NBA Jam, Nokia Snake,

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:12.480
Super Smash Brothers, Uncharted, and where in the world is Carmen Sand Diego I would be very

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:17.880
tempted to vote for Nokia Snake but I think I would give it to King's Quest I think I'd have

01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:22.080
to give it to King's Quest that was that whole Sierra I mean cuz King's Quest to me is

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:28.040
representative of the 90s Sierra PC era which and I'm sure Bobby Black Wolf is nodding his head and

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:33.640
there's many of you out there that are gonna be nodding your head those games were like formative

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:37.880
games for me and the contributions that Roberta Williams and you know everybody that worked on

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:42.800
those games is Sierra and so even Leisure Suit Larry Teehee you know though all of that stuff

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:47.480
was so important to my childhood that like I have to give it to King's Quest for sure and

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:51.840
Carmen Sandiego had a bigger impact on mine I didn't really enjoy the King's Quest games the

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:59.360
only real big game on those lines that I played a significant amount of was Luma yeah and you know

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:04.920
I it's again it's not a it's not a diss on where in the world is Carmen Sandiego like that game was

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:11.720
certainly important too but just for me I put King's Quest ahead of it Loki what about you from

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:14.880
that list what would you what game would you vote for to go in the Hall of Fame on that list

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:29.040
that's the time I didn't like King's Quest one too much I guess I would say Minecraft or Carmen

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:38.360
Sandiego okay I can see my craft but at any rate the voting is going to be going on through the

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:45.840
online ballot on April 2nd and I will find the link to post in chat right now but if you go to

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:53.440
World Video Game Hall of Fame org that's where everything is listed see and they do have some

01:19:53.440 --> 01:20:02.480
write-in places as well oh that's good I'm with Bobby I'm more of a Space Quest guy fair enough

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:08.080
and a one question about Minecraft if that were to win who gets to accept the award Microsoft or

01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:18.040
that other guy I would hope the developer well notch is it yeah but I I don't need to hear him

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:25.200
give a speech so yeah but it was his creation yeah but I I think I'm fully admitting some of that you

01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:29.040
know what the Oscars are politics too I suppose in a way but some of that would weigh into my

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:34.920
decision on why I wouldn't want to see minecraft get it well they still have a development team I

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:43.080
mean that's the folks that should be getting it so also for me it's not that minecraft is minecraft

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:47.080
also a little new for me I know it seems really weird to say but I just feel like some of these

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:51.160
other games on the list have more of a legacy and we have yet to see what minecraft's legacy

01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:56.160
is truly going to be we're still like I feel like minecraft is still still a game that is being

01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:02.400
developed where's that where's that super 4k pack but anyway minecraft is still a game that's on

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:09.480
it's never happening never King's Quest 1 is done Carmen San Diego is done sure there's new Carmen

01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:13.120
San Diego games there might be a new King's Quest games on it but those games essentially are done

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:18.320
so that's another thing that really weighs in for me so I mean be mad if you want I'm just telling

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:26.600
it like it is so there you go all right anyway let's move on let's talk about the next story

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:34.200
which I think Loki is yours so this is kind of fun since everybody's doing those wonderful directs

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:41.600
now so humble bundle is gonna be joining the party with their brand new series called the humble brag

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:48.400
it's where they're gonna be talking about games and I guess showing some different I don't know

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:52.680
deals that they're gonna be doing some of the stuff they're gonna be talking about courses

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:58.200
including their own releases because remember they are publishing some games now like them's

01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:07.320
fighting herds and Temtem the first one's gonna take place on March 24th it looks like at 11 p.m.

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:18.800
Pacific Time and March 25th at 2 p.m. Eastern Time so and those are kind of some weird weird times to

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:26.600
put those live but I guess we'll have to see more about what this is all about I mean I don't know

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:32.960
I don't really have high expectations but neat they might have they might have secured some more

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:36.880
like indie stuff because like you said they're doing publishing now which I totally forgot that

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:41.400
that was the thing but the them fighting herds that's that one's kind of a big deal that's the

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:48.120
one that's like it's my little pony but it's not wink right right and that just came out of early

01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:55.160
access that's the skull girls folks made that game right or am I crazy I don't remember who

01:22:55.160 --> 01:23:01.560
made that okay I just know I just know there was a lot of like pony fandom mixed with like school

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:07.840
girls mixed with that so somebody in chat maybe can explain the difference to me but I just that

01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:12.440
oh thank you DJ Rama S it used the school girls engine that's okay I knew there was a tie to

01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:16.600
school girls in there somehow but it was an independent company okay thank you so I knew

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:20.760
there was a tie-in somewhere there they that's why I love doing this with a live chat room because

01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:25.560
you guys can course correct me when I'm I'm like I remember some of the details but not all of them

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:30.800
because an awful lot happens in gaming so all right all right well we'll see what comes through

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:38.240
with the humble humble brags I love that name yeah so they're saying though okay so they had

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:45.920
a few different dates for the the humble brag presentations although the actual tweet those

01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:51.640
mentions March 24th at 9 a.m. Pacific time which sends more reasonable I'm not sure why they said

01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:57.280
there's bring a humble brag presentation will go live and then they have this like long day range

01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:02.920
so I would say March 24th 9 a.m. Pacific time okay we'll see what they have to announce I guess

01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:06.640
we'll have something to talk about on next week's show regarding all this all right well meanwhile

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:09.960
before we get to the classic game of the week talking about some things you can do right now

01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:15.160
I mentioned earlier in the show I was using Xbox game pass to check out like Halo and stuff this

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:20.800
week and I'm sure some of you guys are using your suddenly open bandwidth connections to download a

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:25.120
lot of stuff that you're a little bit behind on well apparently now Xbox game pass ultimate will

01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:30.080
include bonuses like content in the games themselves and I saw some of this as I was

01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:36.280
browsing this week they're called perks and some of the initial extras involve cosmetics and

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:41.760
characters they're saying a gold ticket mission pass and fantasy star online too I didn't see that

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:45.480
though when I went in to look at the perks but maybe that's not gonna happen till the game

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:50.920
launches I don't know I did see the ship ornaments in Sea of Thieves and the gods and smite I saw

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:55.640
some of that you don't have to do anything extra to enable the perks you just get them through Xbox

01:24:55.640 --> 01:25:01.280
one or you get them through the beta app on Windows 10 or the mobile app so plenty of ways to get

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:07.360
those perks not surprising to hear about that at all that's very similar to what PlayStation Plus

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:12.560
has because they have some perks with games as well like I've seen like apex legends stuff and

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:18.600
things to tie into PlayStation Plus so it's not too surprising to see Microsoft get on on that

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:23.120
too except instead of putting it at the Xbox gold level they're putting it at the game pass level

01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:28.240
but I think we're all sitting here going it's really just a matter of time before they fuse

01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:35.480
Xbox gold and Xbox game pass together I think that's coming it's just a matter of when because

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:40.400
certainly if you want to buy both and I think the game pass ultimate is both those things

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:48.120
combined so a lot of people are getting in on that so anyway there you go let's take a trip

01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:53.600
down memory lane before you could actually download all these special things you had to

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:58.600
have a cartridge if you wanted to play something taking a trip down memory lane every week Dark

01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:02.760
Sakura steps in the vault and finds a game that she thinks hey you should be checking out this

01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:07.080
game this week Dark Sakura what is the classic game of the week that you picked for us this week

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:15.320
I picked a stinker I picked a bad one I picked safe clued in sets pretty fighter and specifically

01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:27.800
this one is on the Super Famicom it is a fighting game from 1984 published by imagineer and it is of

01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:34.760
course a one or two player game it does not go for very much if you find one but it is novel

01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:42.600
it even did get a sequel called pretty fighter X at some point but basically with this game you

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:50.920
are different characters who have different uniforms with a different color and they they

01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:57.960
have some salacious like content but nothing like cornish you know it's like fanboy service you know

01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:08.480
but the original game the one on Super Famicom had different characters eight of them that had

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:15.840
their family name contained something specific for the color that represented them so we had

01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:26.280
Aoki Marin was a schoolgirl that wore Pina Blue and she's the main character of the series there's

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:36.960
a Shiratori Kris who is a nurse her color is white a Saksa Judy who is a friend of Marin's and she

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:47.280
moonlights his athletic dancer and her color is red for Akka there's Kono Keiko who fights an officer here her color is

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:54.240
navy blue Kiyori Yoko who is a college student who just wears you know traditional clothing her color

01:27:54.240 --> 01:28:01.120
is yellow you know kimono by traditional is what I meant Midori Kawa Minami who is a private school

01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:10.000
girl and wears green Momoyama Ai is a gymnast wears like gymnastics outfit her color is pink

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:21.720
Zen Momo like peach and Yamaguki Yawara is a judo wrestler and she wears golden yellow so the game

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:31.200
believe it or not it's not like the worst I have played many many bad fighting games in my time it

01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:39.480
actually is graphically pretty good it the characters are well designed I think the concepts are great

01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:47.080
it's it's the thing about it being terrible it's really average and when something is average we

01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:59.040
call it terrible as far as the other ones or you know I don't think that pretty fighter X was that

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:09.000
much better I actually have pretty fighter X I I had played it so long ago but yeah it's uh it's

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:13.760
pretty average I'm just gonna say that it's I think it's worth everyone playing at least once

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:23.640
and you've got some different interesting things like for example you have throws for your

01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:30.400
characters but you can't throw blocking the hit detection is kind of meh you know sometimes your

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:36.960
projectiles won't hit depending on what's going on and you can you know corner block somebody just

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:44.240
trap them but it's it's average the characters are decently designed you know if a little

01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:52.400
stereotypical but it's worth mentioning because I mean this is one of the early all-female fighting

01:29:52.400 --> 01:30:00.240
games I mean we had the Asuka series you know like Asuka 120% I've done before is a classic game and

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:07.720
gals fighter for Neo Geo pocket color so just throwing it out there this could have been one

01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:16.800
of our originators yeah some people have said it's a very much like some of the Sailor Moon

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:21.200
games from the same era well yeah this this particular fighter we're looking at in the video

01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:25.720
on Twitch right now just straight-up looks like Sailor Moon like it's very interesting well I'm

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:33.480
looking up Imagineer to see what else they did the other website is down well and I think it's

01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:36.880
also just you know even though you kind of highlight this classic game is it's kind of

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:42.320
average I think it's still worth noting that you know this comes from an era when everybody was

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:46.680
trying to copy Street Fighter you know Street Fighter 2 specifically you know Street Fighter

01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:51.440
2 was such a huge game especially when it released on the Super Nintendo that literally everybody was

01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:55.560
trying to copy it and of course there was the whole fighting street or whatever it was called

01:30:56.200 --> 01:31:02.680
literally copying it in some ways but you know other types of clones came out and sometimes you

01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:09.240
know it was like okay make it Street Fighter 2 but like make it for horny boys and that's what

01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:17.240
this is. I knew the Sailor Moon S game that I had was better than this because it was done by

01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:24.120
Arc System. I wish I hadn't sold that game it was kind of fun because it had the chibi mood

01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:28.720
butt smash. I feel like you highlighted that on a previous episode at some point I'm sure you have.

01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:35.200
But I was like I'm pretty sure that Imagineer didn't do it yeah it was Arc System. And this

01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:40.600
again coming out of Japan like I remember playing a Dragon Ball Z game I remember playing a Ranma

01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:45.520
game where I'm a one-half game I remember playing like everybody had to have a fighting game in in

01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:53.720
this certain like 1991 1992 era like on the Super Nintendo was crazy. But at any rate if you want

01:31:54.360 --> 01:32:00.280
average then you're gonna try it and it's cheap you know if you're looking for just something

01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:05.800
that's a little weird but easy to play or if you're just or if you're just horny for waifu fighting

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:12.280
there you go yeah waifu fighting yeah get your waifu fight on. I took that from uh victory today

01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:18.280
all in on waifu dead with legs up yeah it's uh really it's it's ridiculous like charming it's

01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:24.520
if or you could just recognize how ridiculous stupid something like this is like you know it's

01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:30.200
like sometimes you just want to watch a bad movie right like sometimes I want to invite Dark Sakura

01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:35.720
over so we can watch Showgirls and make fun of it because it's a terrible movie and sometimes

01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:44.280
we want to just play Pretty Fighter because it's stupid right yeah yeah hold on I'm double checking

01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:52.920
that yeah developer Sailor Moon asks developer Arc System Works publisher Angel Bandai so it

01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:59.400
was published by Bandai and developed by Arc System there we go all right bam all right there

01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:04.040
it is your classic game of the week Pretty Fighter for short um what was the full name again Dark

01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:11.320
Sakura I missed the full name uh fuck let me get it again pretty fighter no I'll get it hold on it

01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:21.080
is um uh uh pretty fighter as in school uniform legend of course but I noticed even in the the

01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:26.840
stripper stage with the gargoyles yes podcast folks that was a real thing we just saw on twitch

01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:32.040
uh you could see in the background the neon sign said pretty fighter in the back so I guess that's

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:37.400
the that's the code name that game's adopted so all right not every game is a winner but we

01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:42.040
highlight uh the games you should check out just because they have a place in gaming history even

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:46.440
if it's the not so great part of history all right it was worth a mention it was worth a mention all

01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:51.320
right uh until our next segment let's move or until our next classic game segment let's move

01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:55.480
on with this week's show and some of the other segments we have for tonight how's how's my co-host

01:33:55.480 --> 01:34:00.040
Captain Pikachu doing tonight you doing you doing good you hanging in there all right good all right

01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:06.920
let's move on it's it's very boring in this giant room with nobody else but this camera

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:12.440
it's it's the journey of one man going slowly insane while we watch tonight's program

01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:17.320
all right well y'all on discord help keep me company let's get to some rapid fire news

01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:27.080
all right so uh this is the most important feature that's being added to no man's sky

01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:32.440
and that is bobbleheads that's right so they're going to be adding some bobbleheads

01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:38.200
into the next update here so we've got uh two they're sold by the quicksilver bot

01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:44.520
uh the first one being it looks like the specialist polo and then priest entity nada

01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:48.280
are going to be the two that are going to be starting the game they're going to have

01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:53.400
some new ones created later on but those will be the two that you'll start off with so that's

01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:57.560
pretty awesome and even have like this cool little video showing it bobbling as you take off

01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:03.000
uh the other thing is because you know we're under this whole uh covid 19 situation one of

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:08.600
the things that's been affected by that of course is movie theaters and you've seen a lot of these

01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:15.560
different movies that were just literally released in theaters now coming out um on streaming

01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:21.880
services so one of these movies that uh came out not too long ago sonic the hedgehog is actually

01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:27.000
that uh came out not too long ago sonic the hedgehog is actually going to be released on

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:33.880
the 31st of march so you can actually stream it to your house for 20 bucks um so that's pretty

01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:37.240
cool and i know robbie haven't gotten a chance to see the movie is this something that you'd be

01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:41.880
interested in watching um yeah i want to see it at some point but 20 bucks is a little high for me i

01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:45.560
mean that is the price of let's say like two movie tickets or i guess in this day and age one and a

01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:49.800
half movie tickets so the 20 bucks is going to be a great deal like someone in your situation loki

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:54.040
where you have a family of four 20 bucks is a deal but for me and i don't think alan is

01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:58.120
interested in it i mean i guess i'll ask but for me i'd be paying 20 bucks to watch it myself

01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:03.480
so and my normal brain goes i'll go over to someone else's house and watch it but i guess

01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:08.040
i can't really do that right now um so i'm gonna i'm gonna just hold off a little bit and see if

01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:11.240
the price comes down a little bit you know you have a lot of stuff you have a lot of stuff that's

01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:17.880
going direct to netflix and disney plus especially with the uh uh frozen 2 was just like all right

01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:21.320
well since y'all are gonna be stuck at home why not we'll just put out frozen two today

01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:26.200
and then uh what onward like just came out on digital and they've already said it's gonna be

01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:30.040
on disney plus in like three weeks or something like that so that's two weeks they have a two

01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:36.040
week window on that and same with sonic so sonic is going to be coming out later on um in may 19th

01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:40.040
they're going to do the physical release of that and they're also going to digital rentals that

01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:44.680
might be a little bit cheaper than twenty dollars but i'll do the want to watch it i'll do the

01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:48.120
digital rental i don't feel like sonic is a movie i'm going to particularly want to own

01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:51.160
but i'll if it's like a 499 rental sure i'll do that

01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:59.560
all right so uh there you go so let me move on uh some of the rapid fire stories i have tonight

01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:06.440
world of warcraft is offering a 100 experience bonus uh admittedly i haven't played wow in a

01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:11.080
little bit but i thought this was kind of an interesting way to um you know kind of

01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:15.720
entice people to check out the game while you know folks are kind of housebound at this point

01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:21.800
um but uh blizzard has mentioned that from now until april 20th so that's a pretty big window

01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:27.560
um your warcraft character gets winds of wisdom that means you get a 100 XP bonus the buff is

01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:34.040
available in battle of azeroth legion and starter edition players if you're playing world warcraft

01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:40.120
classic you signed up for a grind no xp buff for you so that's that's that um

01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:46.760
now uh of course you can use this to get your characters all leveled up because uh you know

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:50.440
there's going to be a new expansion of world of warcraft coming out i think this fall but one

01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:54.040
thing i think is interesting to point out is that they're offering this whole like level and get

01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:59.640
there faster but don't forget your character is going to get squished so remember that the level

01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:03.880
squish is coming so even if you make it all the way to level what is 120 i think it's the cap

01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:10.120
right now you're gonna squish all the way down to 50 uh but keep in mind the squish i mean it

01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:15.240
doesn't mean if you level to 50 and stop you'll carry over as 50 it's kind of like a sliding

01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:19.480
squish like a level 50 character would be what like probably like level 20 or something once

01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:24.520
the squish happens so do keep that in mind but uh yeah you're you are going to be getting 100

01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:30.840
xp but uh there's the squish coming so uh don't get too used to being that high a level uh also

01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:37.640
in blizzard's world right now they have announced a new overwatch hero uh named echo uh echo is a

01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:44.040
new character with sound abilities it's a new dps character uh and is it a dolphin is it a

01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:50.760
echo is not a dolphin echo uses a mimicked hero's ultimate ability as well that is interesting

01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:56.840
echo is visually and audibly distinguishable from other characters when she i guess i i didn't know

01:38:56.840 --> 01:39:02.600
echo had a gender but apparently echo is she uh echo uh adopts another form uh she cannot clone

01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:09.000
the other team's echo though the main weapon is called tri shot so anyway that is all there uh

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:15.160
echo is currently on the ptr that part surprised me because my assumption was that no more heroes

01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:24.040
were coming until overwatch 2 um so i would so she's the team fortress 2 spy i guess yeah i

01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:28.200
haven't played team fortress 2 in a long time but does the spy clone people's big abilities

01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:33.080
because that's what echo does don't remember but i know you can look like the other people so

01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:38.040
maybe admittedly i haven't played overwatch in a little while alan still plays it a little bit

01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:44.120
um but i haven't checked i he has been playing he's been doing his annual or bi-annual i don't

01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:49.000
know like playthrough of the mass effect trilogy and when he plays mass effect he does every side

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:54.760
quest everything so he just got this weekend to mass effect 2 so i don't think he's touched

01:39:54.760 --> 01:40:00.440
overwatch in a little bit because he's on that right now so uh fifth dream today says echo equals

01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:06.280
shang tsung that's not a bad comparison because i believe uh shang tsung had his own abilities

01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:13.240
but then he could kind of like copy others so that's a pretty good comparison so ss200 matt

01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:19.480
says she's ditto she can't copy another ditto you guys are on a roll i guess this is a gaming trope

01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:24.920
we've seen several times before uh but not too surprising all right anyway uh dark soccer how

01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:33.080
about your rapid fire stories just a couple um so uh for uh people who like free stuff

01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:41.160
the epic game store is doing uh watchdogs and stanley parable as freebies so go get them

01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:48.120
um and honestly to be perfectly honest the stanley parable is absolutely worth paying anything so

01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:53.160
i'll tell you that right now um but yeah go ahead and uh check them out yeah that's one reason i'm

01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:57.240
glad we highlighted that tonight because uh i think those games are only available for like

01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:02.440
a week or two so yeah go go grab the stanley parable for sure if you i mean if i realize not

01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:05.640
everybody's down with the epic store but if the epic store is installed on your computer and it's

01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:10.200
not a problem for you go get the stanley parable and and why not get watchdogs you might as well

01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:15.720
right of course some of us already have it on steam and have had it fair but now you'll know

01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:25.480
what what we love about it um and so also um uh sony is doing uh a kindness it looks like

01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:36.120
i'm starting on monday march 23rd at 11 59 p.m pacific time so um wow i guess that's going to be

01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:43.640
yeah late monday um they're releasing both tomb raider and lara croft the the original the 2013

01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:51.400
tomb raider and lara croft and the temple of osiris for free on steam um it doesn't does it

01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:58.280
say how long that's going to be going for um it doesn't say but um they have instructions on the

01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:06.120
square enix site well looks like it's already up now um but at any rate um you can uh

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:11.160
they've got instructions on their site but you go in and you'll buy it for zero dollars and

01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:17.640
um you go to your my orders you unlock the activation key and you do all the instructions

01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:22.360
so there you go and if you haven't played the tomb raider reboot yet like you know i feel

01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:26.440
like that game's been out a while now uh you really should get on it that's that's it's a

01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:31.400
really great um reinvention of tomb raider i had a lot of fun with it so it's definitely

01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:38.440
worth your time that time is when it ends sorry oh so you gotta really get on that yeah and then

01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:43.640
i don't even know if you need to do that because they're free right now on steam because i actually

01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:47.880
downloaded them already right that's what steam that's what this is about is that they're free

01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:54.520
on steam until tomorrow right exactly yeah their instructions are really like convoluted it's like

01:42:54.520 --> 01:43:00.200
a login to your square enix games account and i think they're having people do it on the website

01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:06.600
so it's done might be convincing people to sign up for a square enix account so that they can send

01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:11.800
you emails about their upcoming products because that's how i heard about this was i got an email

01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:17.320
from square enix because i'm i'm a final fantasy 11 and 14 subscriber and i'm pretty sure i used

01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:21.800
their official store at one point to get like a heaven's word collector's edition of final fantasy

01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:27.400
14 or something so um yeah now i'm on the mailing list yeah just skip all that just go straight to

01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:32.200
steam and just add them to your collection yeah it's easier through the app i think that their

01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:40.760
instructions were um uh more pertaining to buying it through the website got it all right well

01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:45.240
let's travel around the world and check out the upcoming releases because uh you know there are

01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:50.600
still games coming out and especially because so much is digital in this day and age um you know i

01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:57.560
don't i i do enjoy my physical copies i'm gonna hope that my final fantasy 7 um re remaster or

01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:02.120
whatever uh re remake i hope the fantasy sim remake i ordered it through amazon so i'm gonna

01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:06.760
hope it still shows up on the release day uh i did not get the collector's edition i heard there was

01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:12.200
a whole bump but i'm prepared that it might because yes like many of you i have heard that

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:17.320
amazon is shifting some of their priorities and i get it but if we're going to be on house arrest

01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:22.360
through the end of april then like i'm not in a huge rush like if i get it a few days late i

01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:26.280
get it a few days late whatever anyway but let's travel around the world and check out what's

01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:34.920
coming out this week loki all right so we've got half-life alex on pc for vr uh the legends of

birth exe colon late what kind of names are these arc system works that's on pc

01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:32.040
you know something that's on my list for the us for some reason is cooking mama cook star i don't

01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:39.160
know if i heard that but that is out this week on the switch it's important no i i did not say that

01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:44.040
like that's what we need right now is mama to fix it because we've got a fucking mess going on

01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:49.400
we need mama to fix it so anyway something to think about all right well i'll travel to japan

01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:54.040
here uh and check out the japanese releases of which uh there's just a couple things this week

01:45:54.040 --> 01:46:00.280
on the switch one piece pirate warriors 4 is out this week revenge of justice is also out and on

01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:05.640
the nintendo switch space invaders invincible collection i have no idea what that is it looks

01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:10.680
like there's a whole like it comes with a space invaders switch game uh and a whole bunch of like

01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:15.480
little collectibles thing and keep in mind the space invaders phenomenon like that a lot of that

01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:21.560
was japan like there was it was huge there it's it's really a part of their culture um it does

01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:27.240
come with the space invaders original from 1978 it comes with space invaders part two space invaders

01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:33.800
91 and space invaders extreme that's pretty cool as well as space invaders dx space cyclone lunar

01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:37.960
rescue and apparently more to come with that so that's a pretty cool collection i wonder if that's

01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:42.280
coming out here in the states at some point but the space invaders invincible collection is coming

01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:46.840
out this week in japan on the switch now looking at the playstation 4 real quick we see a lot of

01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:51.880
overlap because revenge of justice is out there as well as well as one piece pirate warriors 4

01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:57.400
that's basically just collection not out on ps4 though but playstation 4 does also have

01:46:57.400 --> 01:47:05.080
uh keniro lover ishi is coming out this week and life is strange 2 getting its japanese release

01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:08.520
yes i know that game's been out here in the us for a bit but the japanese release is finally

01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:13.800
happening this week a multi-language edition so i imagine some localized acting for japan

01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:15.240
um how about the uk dark soccer

01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:29.480

i understand a lot of you have had your minds in other places this week anyway let's move on

01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:56.280
and uh to our next story loki

01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:05.320
all right so uh we were just talking about some free games and so of course it's nice to see that

01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:11.240
there's some more free games you can play um steam is doing this the steam game festival spring

01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:19.960
edition between now and the 23rd and with that you can test out uh 59 games that are part of

01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:26.600
their kind of indie showcase um so these were some from indie mega booth wings fun indie mix

01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:33.320
data devs and you can check them out uh some of the more notable ones i saw in there let's see

01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:41.000
here there's a long list um i don't know there's some pretty cool games like uh skate bird that

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:47.160
was one that was pretty cool i know i've been following them on twitter um what was the other

01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:58.120
ones uh there's a game called coffee talk kung fu kickball clang 2 uh giant silent bob mall brawl

01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:07.320
um that's kind of interesting and yeah so lots of uh different demos you can check out um granted

01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:11.960
you want to do it sooner than later because you know time is running out but i imagine that more

01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:15.720
these types of things are going to be available i know there is even a curated list that someone

01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:21.800
did of um different games that have been available and like even all these different game jams are

01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:28.040
going on they have one about uh the whole covid19 stuff about staying inside and um there's a pretty

01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:34.680
funny one about feeding animals at a park and you're this old guy and you have to feed the

01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:39.800
animals the right food and then if they get too uppity on you you hit them with your stick so i

01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:44.920
thought that was hilarious um so yeah check it out um you know lots of different free games even

01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:49.240
on hiio and stuff but uh this would be a cool place to check out some of these indie games that

01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:55.960
were shown off and some of these festivals that actually been closed coffee talk the game neither

01:50:55.960 --> 01:51:01.080
about coffee nor talking discuss no i actually don't know what that game is about but uh i

01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:04.760
couldn't help but think of that since we're gonna bring up saturday night live on this show old

01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:11.800
school from the 90s dana carvey and then mike myers and coffee talk so all right um

01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:16.120
i will have to check out some of the games i had no idea there was a jay and silent bob game

01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:21.960
in that expo i have to check that out yeah i'm assuming that ties in with the new movie which i

01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:31.400
did get that chance to watch the movie this week and uh it's okay it's it's all right

01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:32.200
all right

01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:42.360
all right well let's move on and uh talk about uh this samsung story so samsung uh is actually

01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:50.440
going to be closing their pc to mobile service uh samsung is um uh and it kind of strikes a chord

01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:54.360
right now because i feel like nvidia has like a similar thing going on i mean i know it's not

01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:57.880
pc to mobile it's like a different thing but i feel like a lot of these things are under the

01:51:57.880 --> 01:52:02.600
microscope right now but samsung is going to be closing their service on march the 27th

01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:08.440
so uh play galaxy link allowed you to play pc games on your phone um so they are shutting down

01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:14.360
the game streaming service on uh march 27th sadly they didn't say why just internal policy changes

01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:17.800
but i couldn't help but wonder if some of the stuff we've watched is happening to in video with

01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:21.800
something i wonder if some of that was coming into play i don't know but they didn't confirm or deny

01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:29.080
any of that they're just saying they want to more effectively refocus its resources um also of note

01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:34.280
samsung has also noted that they're teaming up with microsoft on a game streaming experience

01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:40.360
that'll show up later in 2020 could it be that samsung is somehow involved with xcloud or

01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:45.640
something along those lines we have yet to see but that is something that is uh looking like

01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:51.320
it could be in the um future for samsung but for now their current service is going to be going

01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:57.640
away um moving on to talk quickly about a third-party app that actually will make your

01:52:57.640 --> 01:53:05.160
smartphone into a virtual joycon so let's say you uh lose your joycon or you want another one or

01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:09.480
something like that it's interesting uh there's apparently an app out there and right now it's

01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:13.960
only on android but who knows if it's allowed to stick around maybe it'll show up other places too

01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:21.000
uh the android uh phone has a game call or an app called joycon droid and it will allow your phone

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:27.560
to be a virtual joycon um it'll work but it's probably you know again keep in mind the actual

01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:33.800
joy cons have a lot more tech inside them that your phones don't actually have so while it might

01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:39.160
help you like have a buzzer in a game or something like that i wouldn't really want to use this to

01:53:39.160 --> 01:53:46.280
play every game but it's it might work for animal crossing heck so there is that all right just a

01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:50.600
couple more stories for you guys before we get to uh listener round table which tonight is just

01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:54.200
going to be exclusive to our chat room so if you have questions you might want to start putting

01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:59.000
those out in our chat room uh so like i was going to say with that whole joycon thing that's a

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:02.680
pretty good idea just for like even like mario party or something like that so you have your

01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:08.040
friends over and like you don't want to buy 80 you know pairs of controllers so you just have

01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:13.080
a joycon for each person just grab a bunch of phones and set it up that way well you know one

01:54:13.080 --> 01:54:17.320
thing that missed our show world tonight was the whole uh intellivision trailer that came out so

01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:21.080
intellivision put out a new trailer right bobby talked about this on his show a little bit

01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:25.960
and i'd seen the trailer earlier in the week and the whole like controller via smartphone app i

01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:30.040
believe that's something intellivision confirmed they want to do so that way you know because

01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:35.400
they're trying to be very big on multiplayer gaming in the same room uh family game night

01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:39.560
type of things and it would make a lot of sense like oh hey i only have two controllers you know

01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:43.160
what instead of charging families money to go buy an extra controller well they can do that if they

01:54:43.160 --> 01:54:46.920
want for the collectability or whatever but you can use a smartphone maybe if it's something that

01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:51.640
you aren't gonna use very often or something like that so it's kind of interesting it's like a

01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:57.400
similar idea that's kind of baked into the system and then of course you can't help but think about

01:54:57.400 --> 01:55:03.640
jackbox party pack where i feel like the whole smartphone controller thing really started i mean

01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:07.160
sure i think we've always had mods and and all these types of things but i i feel like that

01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:12.120
really took off with jackbox party pack which those games are having a real i don't know if

01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:16.680
you guys have noticed but i noticed those games are showing up everywhere right now um with this

01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:21.960
situation a lot of friends of mine um staying in touch by playing those games over the internet

01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:28.120
since they're so easy to really pick up and go so kind of interesting all right well anyhow

01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:32.040
let's move on uh loki you got another story for us before we get to listen to round table

01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:40.600
yeah so this is interesting so uh we had of course the whole reveal of some of the specs of the

01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:49.000
xbox series x last week and then of course this week we then get major nelson putting out a tweet

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:55.720
about a release date now he said that you know an xbox product page in some regions um you know

01:55:55.720 --> 01:56:03.320
originally they had uh said there was showing a holiday or a thanksgiving 2020 release of course

01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:08.360
come to find out that's not necessarily true he's actually clarified that it's

01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:14.040
just holiday right now so whoops we accidentally uh put a release date where there is none so

01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:18.680
i mean i'm assuming it'll come out around that time but it hasn't been confirmed yet yeah i

01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:21.880
think it's one of those things where people are reading into it nobody's gonna launch a console

01:56:21.880 --> 01:56:26.920
on a holiday like that and even even with the controversial stores being open on thanksgiving

01:56:26.920 --> 01:56:30.680
and that whole stuff like they're not they're not gonna launch a console on that day but i think

01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:35.560
that gives you an idea oh that's around the time frame which of course it's around the time frame

01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:41.640
they're gonna launch the console uh almost almost big almost every console has launched in november

01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:46.840
one of the big exceptions of course being the switch which launched in the spring um but it

01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:52.920
looks like microsoft is still targeting that fall holiday time frame and kind of confirming that in

01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:58.920
light of everything that's going on in the world with covid now um it could still get pushed back

01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:04.520
i wouldn't be shocked at all if something like playstation 5 or xbox uh x gets pushed back to

01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:10.680
spring next year even further back depending on what's happening but um you know uh that's

01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:14.360
certainly what they're aiming for and i don't think that's a huge surprise right and that could

01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:19.560
have been the original plan that it was going to be thanksgiving but uh or around that time but you

01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:24.920
never know with the way supply chains are now and with everyone not working because of everything

01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:30.840
it's it's hard to say i mean it's still a wait we'll see there's still a long way to go to see

01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:35.560
kind of like what the the where all the cards kind of land and it really just depends on how

01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:41.320
long does this go on you know so we'll see all right well moving on to talk about uh google

01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:46.920
stadia and kind of the first discount for google stadia for the hardware and i'm using my quotee

01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:51.800
fingers because again i think we all know generally the the actual concept of stadia is that you're

01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:56.280
not going to need hardware for google stadia you'll be able to play it in a browser but

01:57:56.280 --> 01:58:02.520
the google stadia starter pack has gotten a discount so uh and it was just in time for

01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:07.960
doom eternal which is something that you can play on stadia if you like so uh it was just a one day

01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:13.560
i think it was today or it was earlier this week uh was the sale so i'm not sure you can still take

01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:18.680
advantage of it unfortunately but it's still worth highlighting because it is a sale already

01:58:18.680 --> 01:58:23.800
on stadia hardware so just take that what it is but they had knocked down the price to 99

01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:31.880
instead of 129 and that was the controller the chrome cast ultra and three months of stadia pro

01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:36.760
so um i don't know if anybody took advantage of that because of doom eternal or if anybody's

01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:43.480
been playing uh doom eternal on google stadia but uh that is available so i'm still curious to see

01:58:43.480 --> 01:58:50.280
what happens with a um you know browser launch and kind of the launch for stadia for other platforms

01:58:50.280 --> 01:58:55.160
i got a chrome cast uh or excuse me not a chrome cast a chrome book that's not doing a heck of a

01:58:55.160 --> 01:59:00.200
lot right now uh it's pretty much an electric blanket for mr smoosh so um i would be very

01:59:00.200 --> 01:59:04.840
curious to see what stadia would look like on a system like that because you know that's where

01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:09.640
i think the street you know because obviously those things don't run a lot but if stadia is

01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:14.600
mostly streaming it might kind of look games might look pretty good on there for for certain things

01:59:14.600 --> 01:59:20.680
so we'll see but i imagine everything that's going on in the world again has google reassessing a lot

01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:27.480
of those types of things and some folks in chat commenting on uh yes mr smoosh was getting picked

01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:32.280
up in the background because uh his other dad decided that now is a great time to open up one

01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:37.080
of those smelly cans of food and so smoosh comes running because he smells the food uh and uh yeah

01:59:37.080 --> 01:59:41.480
as 200 matt saying smoosh has thoughts on that topic he thinks the xbox should be released on

01:59:41.480 --> 01:59:46.440
thanksgiving so he can eat some turkey while everybody is playing the new console yeah fair

01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:52.200
enough fair enough all right well uh this is the part of the show where we would get to the listener

01:59:52.200 --> 01:59:56.760
round table uh if you guys have questions in chat for us go ahead and ask them over at twitch tv

01:59:56.760 --> 02:00:01.960
slash vog network uh for tonight we are going to forego discord because we're using discord

02:00:01.960 --> 02:00:06.920
to connect us uh to the show right now um so we're going to forego that for now but if you

02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:10.840
do have general questions or comments you can put those in our chat room and we'll be reading some

02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:17.400
of those on here uh pod culture in chat says bring smoosh on cam uh i would love to but that

02:00:17.400 --> 02:00:23.640
requires me leaving cam to go get him and he just dug into his food he's not gonna want to leave

02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:27.640
that he'll be very unhappy if i take him away from that so you're gonna sadly have to give him

02:00:27.640 --> 02:00:32.200
a little while and the show will probably be done by the time he's ready because you know he has to

02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:37.160
chow it all down and he's gonna be you know he's gonna sit down and be fat for a little bit

02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:44.600
then kind of go over and drink a little bit of water and all that good stuff so anyway um i

02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:48.360
don't know if you guys have any last minute stories while we wait and see if anybody's got

02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:56.760
questions or comments for us in chat um sure i do so uh since of course everybody is canceling all

02:00:56.760 --> 02:01:03.800
sports uh one of those sports that's been affected by that is formula one and so because of that

02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:09.480
formula one has announced that f1 esports virtual grand prix series is going to be a thing that

02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:15.240
happens this year and with that they're going to have a number of the current f1 drivers playing

02:01:15.240 --> 02:01:23.240
the official codemasters game f1 2019 and on pc in having that broadcast worldwide in lieu of the

02:01:23.240 --> 02:01:28.840
races that's kind of neat um and bobby was talking a little bit on a show about i don't know if it

02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:36.120
was this or something similar but apparently there was some racing esports on tv today because

02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:40.600
today was supposed to be a nascar day and it's kind of kind of an interesting situation with

02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:45.880
the world that we're in all these sporting events are getting cancelled so what are the tv stations

02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:52.360
going to show uh and so some i'm sure some are doing movies of the week and so forth but uh some

02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:59.640
are showing esports events so if you can't do nascar why not do e nascar i think yes and then

02:01:59.640 --> 02:02:07.400
as bobby's putting it uh espn 2 is doing the ocho so they had a lot of um crazy different events

02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:13.000
in there i know uh one of the like marble racing that they do on youtube was one of the things that

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:19.560
they are showing in there they're the tetris uh championships i want to say they were doing like

02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:24.360
some sort of eating contest at one point axe throwing or something i don't know it's all

02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:31.560
sorts of fun stuff almost makes me wish i had espn uh and nascar's was the i racing was the name of

02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:37.800
that game that they were um doing on uh tv um here's a comment uh from chat uh or question

02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:42.920
act deaf says i got a question with this quarantine taking place do you think twitch

02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:48.120
streaming will now be something that people start doing now well not only twitch but you get the

02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:54.440
idea um absolutely um i think twitch is a very interesting way for people to kind of keep in

02:02:54.440 --> 02:03:02.280
touch um i also notice our numbers for viewing are up slightly tonight i mean not a ton but

02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:07.880
they're up slightly tonight because all the usual things that we're up against such as sporting

02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:14.760
events uh and so forth are are cancelled um i'm you'd be surprised i'm not happy about that

02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:19.320
because i kind of like the way the world used to be um i understand why we're in this scenario and

02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:25.800
so forth um so i guess i'll take it but um yeah i think more people are drawn to twitch because

02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:31.560
people are making original content out of their homes um and i think there are a lot of big

02:03:31.560 --> 02:03:38.440
personalities out there and so forth where when you know the with when to create content for twitch

02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:44.440
or youtube or a lot of stuff all you really need is yourself and a camera you don't necessarily

02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:50.600
need a big uh film crew to be able to make that kind of stuff so i think that space is where

02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:58.920
you're gonna see content now that doesn't mean it's all gonna be good content because i talked

02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:04.280
earlier about the youtubers that blew the sony stuff way out of proportion and that's part of

02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:09.800
what i think we're gonna miss about the professional filmmakers and the professional stuff is that that

02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:14.440
kind of quality level not to say the indie stuff is bad i would not want to shoot ourselves on the

02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:20.520
foot like that but there is a certain type of uh quality process we'll say that goes with that

02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:26.040
professional caliber of uh streaming and television production and so forth that i think some of us

02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:32.600
will start to miss the longer that this goes on but um television survived the writer's strike

02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:38.120
it'll survive this too um not everything survived the writer's strike though remember remember the

02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:45.000
tv shows heroes when it was good yeah uh i know you know it's funny i watched the uh show on

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:50.920
netflix actually this week called freaks that kind of reminded me of like a pilot for a hero

02:04:50.920 --> 02:04:55.080
type show it was actually pretty cool so hey that's something you guys could watch you know

02:04:55.080 --> 02:05:00.440
it says uh everyone's got a lot of free time now i guess um some other great questions from chat

02:05:00.440 --> 02:05:04.920
sia tabiri is asking where in the world is carmen san diego was mentioned in the convo about the

02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:10.840
hall of fame topic uh any thoughts on the best carmen san diego tv series adaptation

02:05:10.840 --> 02:05:16.840
where in the world versus where on earth the cartoon versus where in time the tv show uh later

02:05:16.840 --> 02:05:20.760
one i know it's a tangent but it's a fun conversation i have to be honest i haven't really

02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:25.640
seen the netflix specials so the only thing i know of when it comes to television and where in the

02:05:25.640 --> 02:05:32.120
world is carmen san diego is the old pbs game show uh with the the the rockafellas singing the theme

02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:38.760
song and all that stuff and i i i i don't go ahead i played a lot on a map on the first mac

02:05:38.760 --> 02:05:44.520
came out in 1984 i played a lot of it and then i played where in time where in time for me was

02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:50.520
more fun because it was history too um sia tabiri is curious about the tv adaptations though if you

02:05:50.520 --> 02:05:58.280
have a particular favorite i didn't really watch much of any of them i would just do the themes

02:05:58.840 --> 02:06:07.640
go do my day yeah i think i watched the original like um the carmen san diego show i don't think

02:06:07.640 --> 02:06:14.120
i've seen where in time but the original was all right yeah uh yeah i like the game show it was a

02:06:14.120 --> 02:06:18.680
lot of fun i like pbs had a lot of really good shows in the 90s but that just might be you know

02:06:18.680 --> 02:06:25.320
my my kid slash teen voice coming through i don't know uh what do we get in the twitch marathon of

02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:30.920
like three two one contact and stuff like all that like nothing is off the table for how people

02:06:30.920 --> 02:06:37.560
are going to resolve their boredom so stay tuned anyway um let's see uh quest buster says as a

02:06:37.560 --> 02:06:43.080
tangent on the streaming note more people are definitely heading online to play steam logged

02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:47.080
its highest number of concurrent users last week if i recall correctly yeah we had a story about

02:06:47.080 --> 02:06:51.720
that briefly last week that steam reached an all-time high and they're probably gonna keep

02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:57.000
those numbers are gonna keep going up and up unlike the stock market wamp wamp but yeah those

02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:03.480
numbers are probably gonna keep climbing um let's see uh s200 matt says the entertainment industry

02:07:03.480 --> 02:07:11.400
will bounce back some of your local businesses may not yeah it's a very um very real prospect

02:07:11.400 --> 02:07:17.640
um so you know those of you that have the income to be able to spend on things like local businesses

02:07:17.640 --> 02:07:21.400
i hope you're planning to do so when those businesses open back up or if they're serving

02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:27.240
food to go right now those are great places to support um so i was going to mention real quick

02:07:27.240 --> 02:07:33.400
about the twitch traffic so they are saying that um overall year over year there's been a three

02:07:33.400 --> 02:07:41.000
percent increase in new accounts on twitch and then 15 increase over the last few days of

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:46.440
streaming on twitch wow i'm not surprised this is the time where people pick up a new hobby and

02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:51.800
things like that you know and that's uh to pass the time and i'm i'm all for it you know somebody

02:07:51.800 --> 02:07:56.040
we might have some great new voices out there that uh haven't been heard yet that will be through all

02:07:56.040 --> 02:08:01.480
this um tiger claw mentioning the funny thing is i've been doing the whole self-isolation thing for

02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:05.240
years with friends living in another state and some relatives in another city i've been alone

02:08:05.240 --> 02:08:10.520
for most of my life so if i wanted to play games with someone i can only be via online you know and

02:08:10.520 --> 02:08:15.080
that's a running gag if you will i'm using my quotey fingers since i don't know if it's really

02:08:15.080 --> 02:08:20.200
a gag but that this is the moment that introverts have been preparing for is kind of like a line

02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:24.680
that i hear around uh the internet and you know again i don't i don't want to be insensitive or

02:08:24.680 --> 02:08:30.360
rude but i definitely think there are like some personalities that are totally okay with like

02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:35.080
what's going on right now and that's or you know what i mean like are able to adapt easier we'll

02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:39.000
say that because like like you said tiger claw that this is something you're kind of used to

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:45.560
anyway um this is this is a challenge for me i'm gonna be honest this whole thing is it's hard

02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:50.360
because i'm a little bit more extroverted by nature i like to be around go out with people

02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:54.600
do stuff on the weekend even if it's just i'm going out to a restaurant with alan and even if

02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:58.040
it's just us or meeting one or two other people like those are the types of things i like to do

02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:04.760
and like i know we're only a week in barely but i can kind of like already feel it i'm like dang

02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:11.000
this is if this goes on for eight weeks it's gonna be hard um i've already been this way for

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:17.720
a week yeah honestly it's been beautiful yeah but that's right but that's your personality and my

02:09:17.720 --> 02:09:23.240
personality i'm saying yeah the thing is is that now it's kind of like what introverts go through

02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:32.280
in reverse or what people with autism like me go through in reverse you're now in our comfort zone

02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:40.440
and it's been i don't really have anything to offer people in those circumstances other than

02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:46.840
that i think that for some of us who are more adapted to this kind of thing we need to be there

02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:56.040
for the people who aren't i think that's fair so um anyway uh where else i'm looking some folks are

02:09:56.040 --> 02:09:59.880
talking about i knew somebody that was on the carmen san diego game show it's kind of fun uh

02:09:59.880 --> 02:10:04.440
fifth dream today says yeah my life definitely less impacted than most because i have social

02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:11.080
anxiety or other reasons i just stay home as much as possible sure um oh she hulk says support your

02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:15.240
local podcast as well like olr with some biddies thank you so much for that she hulk really

02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:21.160
appreciate that um s2100 matt says i do hate the narrative that was floating around that this

02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:26.440
whole thing was karma to jocks with sports being cancelled what bothers me is that plenty of people

02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:31.320
who work in sports that aren't jocks or are gamers like everyone else um here's the thing

02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:36.360
with all that stuff you know and i've heard the crap about boomer doomer and all this other

02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:43.400
bullshit as well let's keep something in mind human beings have the capability of discriminating

02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:50.120
viruses don't discriminate and y'all better keep that in the forefront of your mind as to why we're

02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:55.000
all doing this whole self-isolation and all this stuff i mean yes maybe the statistics are showing

02:10:55.000 --> 02:11:02.200
that less younger people are um being as severely impacted but that doesn't mean every everybody

02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:08.200
who's young is immune because this virus doesn't discriminate viruses can't discriminate you know

02:11:08.200 --> 02:11:14.040
any sense so and if i may jock and boomer also it doesn't fucking matter when it comes to a virus

02:11:14.040 --> 02:11:21.160
yeah please and for everyone complaining about the shelter in place you know people can still

02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:25.080
get their necessities they can leave for those things but i want to put this

02:11:25.080 --> 02:11:31.000
into perspective um in fact someone actually just posted this on twitter and i'm going to steal it

02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:37.960
and frank lived in a practical closet for two years you can endure the next 10 weeks

02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:45.320
yeah i i you know i i'm gonna sit here and say it sucks but i'm gonna recognize it's what has

02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:52.040
to be done and i'll get by you know luckily i have a show like olr to kind of be an outlet of sorts

02:11:52.040 --> 02:11:57.240
you'd think i would be doing more personal streaming but i'm gonna give you a very honest

02:11:57.240 --> 02:12:03.000
answer on that um you'd think i would do more personal streaming but kind of like the opposite

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:09.480
effect is kind of happening is that because i'm not really able to go out and be social

02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:18.040
i can't really get the energy to do that during the week as well olr is kind of the type of thing

02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:22.680
where i've been doing it every week for so long it's like it's just like a habit like it's like

02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:27.560
it's it's like ingrained into my dna right now at this point um this show is old enough to fucking

02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:32.440
vote pretty much uh so that's you know kind of like where where olr is at but like when it comes

02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:38.360
to like the impromptu streaming stuff like it's not as easy for me to do that so that's why i'm

02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:43.480
being very supportive of like other people who are thriving in what's going on right now you

02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:47.960
know like dark soccer to use you as an example you've kind of said that and you streamed for

02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:52.840
the first time in quite some time a couple days ago and you kind of have more a desire to do that

02:12:52.840 --> 02:12:58.840
and so i kind of see my role right now as because i am having a hard time and i've got to use my

02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:04.520
energy focusing on not going crazy um i support dark soccer and what she's doing and i support

02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:12.040
all of the rest of you that want to go out and create content so um other comments in chat um

02:13:12.680 --> 02:13:17.320
fifth dream today says by shelter in place they mean stop waving your dick in public going you

02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:22.200
can't tell me what to do and you don't need to buy a car new shoes and have a wedding this week

02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:27.960
yeah all those things will be waiting for you uh in the summertime hopefully um s2100 matt says i

02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:32.040
went for a senior drive yesterday i wanted to do something that was wasn't around people but also

02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:38.600
got me out of the house i love driving uh i find it relaxing so a nice scenic drive filled that

02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:44.920
void i needed yeah uh and that sounds like a great i might try to do something like that next weekend

02:13:44.920 --> 02:13:49.880
but the the only challenge i see with that is that i also think a lot of those places where people

02:13:49.880 --> 02:13:55.320
would usually go like let's say the established trails and things like that are probably going to

02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:59.800
be very busy and it's going to be very hard to do social distancing at places like that but i know

02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:03.960
in your case i think you said you picked more of a random type of place to go to and that probably

02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:11.080
worked out a lot better um i have been like going to the parks nearby i'm trying to go out once a

02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:15.160
day to walk around the park i wasn't successful with that every day last week but maybe i'll do

02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:19.160
better this week uh trying to go just like do a lap around the park and so forth so i'm getting

02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:23.960
a little vitamin d every day and then like i went out to the bigger park i live near just to like

02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:30.120
go play ingress and it's weird because like right now i could really give a shit about ingress and

02:14:30.120 --> 02:14:35.720
like the the whole fielding and the scoring and the who's gonna throw a megan on i i don't give

02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:41.000
a shit because there's more important things right now but yet i did find some odd little comfort

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:46.440
that like the uh park near me was kind of blue and i was like oh this gives me a little something to

02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:51.560
do and i can keep six feet away from other people while i do it okay i did my thing i got outside i

02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:56.360
got my vitamin d i'll go back home now so and rob yeah i can't do those things

02:14:58.040 --> 02:15:04.280
oh yeah yeah i'm going out to check my mail is the most i go outside

02:15:06.040 --> 02:15:10.360
and that that makes perfect sense i mean and when i was going through the swine flu thing years ago

02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:16.760
it was kind of a similar sort of thing but it also helped in that situation to know it was only for a

02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:24.200
week and this might go on a lot longer but you know hopefully um yeah i don't know when i'm going

02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:30.840
to get better or when i'm going to hear from my doctor they're not seeing anybody in person they're

02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:41.400
doing as much to treat people over the phone or um by email and keep people out of the hospitals

02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:45.800
yeah because with all the people who could possibly have this disease in the hospital

02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:50.760
they want to keep the hospitals free for that but yeah there's a covid doesn't stop everything else

02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:55.240
that could go wrong you know i could still have an accident at home where i slip and break my leg

02:15:55.240 --> 02:15:59.880
and it's gonna you know it's gonna be gonna be rough so they're gonna be like learn to split

02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:06.920
bitch yeah right so yeah all right we'll mail you some coding here you go yeah all right well

02:16:06.920 --> 02:16:11.160
anyway um for now i think we'll go ahead and kind of wrap up with that uh unless loki i don't know

02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:13.640
if you have any other last minute stories you want to mention before we wrap up here

02:16:13.640 --> 02:16:22.120
um yeah i was gonna say there's a few more games that are free right now so you should check uh

02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:27.000
check them out on steam uh the first one being droffle 2 is free until april 10th

02:16:27.640 --> 02:16:32.920
and goat of duty is free until march 31st so go check those out

02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:42.200
sorry for the silence i was answering a question in chat there so all right yay more free stuff

02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:46.680
maybe there'll be even more free stuff in the next week who knows we'll see so um all right

02:16:46.680 --> 02:16:50.920
i think with that we will probably wrap things up for the night here uh at the voice geeks network

02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:55.800
and here at orange lounge radio but we will be back in seven days to do it all again uh as far

02:16:55.800 --> 02:17:00.360
as we know at least until at least until early april the show is probably going to be like this

02:17:00.360 --> 02:17:04.440
for a little bit so um hope you guys enjoyed it nonetheless even though we weren't all in the same

02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:08.520
room but i think we were still able to bring you a lot of the stuff that you would expect from a

02:17:08.520 --> 02:17:13.640
usual edition olr um but let's go around and get everybody's final thought before we wrap up for

02:17:13.640 --> 02:17:18.760
the night uh dark soccer do you have any final thoughts to leave our folks with tonight i would

02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:25.720
like to be able to speak without being winded very much well thank you for um going through

02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:30.520
the show tonight but do i mean hopefully in seven days this isn't as much of a problem but

02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:35.240
do feel if you need to go like go like take care of yourself don't don't do the dumb thing i did

02:17:35.240 --> 02:17:39.720
and make my make my strep throat worse by hosting two shows over valentine's day weekend

02:17:39.720 --> 02:17:44.440
which i still have a cough from because of that and every time i cough like i feel the looks

02:17:44.440 --> 02:17:50.360
coming on when i'm at the park or something like that so well i've been i've been taking it pretty

02:17:50.360 --> 02:17:57.000
easy dan's gotten used to reading my my gestures that aren't all you know a single raised digit

02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:03.320
and we've got fresh bread it was honestly breaking baking bread last night set me off

02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:09.160
which is usually a stress relief for me because you know i get to beat the crap out of some dough

02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:13.560
and it's delicious when i'm done it's still delicious don't get me wrong

02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:21.960
but i was a mess afterwards just baking bread so all right well everyone take care of yourself

02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:28.360
listen to the signs ret let's listen to doctors uh rest up feel better and uh we'll hope we'll

02:18:28.440 --> 02:18:30.600
hope when we talk to you in seven days you're doing much better okay

02:18:32.040 --> 02:18:35.880
thank you you're welcome uh loki any final thoughts tonight

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:42.840
i just found out that apparently you can use the toilets in animal crossing

02:18:44.600 --> 02:18:49.000
that's interesting i guess you actually always been able to use the toilet since the first one

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:53.400
yeah but he didn't but i don't believe in every single game he's like and that takes

02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:58.840
care of that with the flushing they've always had the flushing that's funny that takes care

02:18:58.840 --> 02:19:04.920
of that that's funny um i need a super toilet now yeah and actually spoiler alert one of the

02:19:04.920 --> 02:19:12.120
early rewards you get is toilet paper it's almost like animal crossing foretold the future why do

02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:19.320
you talk to me like this all right y'all really added toilet paper like for real no i was smart

02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:24.680
bought um an extra pack before things got crazy although we were getting low on paper towels so

02:19:24.680 --> 02:19:30.360
i had to get some industrial paper towels and so i got these really weird looking brown things that

02:19:30.360 --> 02:19:35.960
you would normally find in like an office calm oh yeah dan's actually still been uh dealing with

02:19:35.960 --> 02:19:43.640
his mom's place and there was a stash of toilet paper paper towels and cleaning supplies nice

02:19:44.520 --> 02:19:49.000
yeah so yeah and i i heard some of the stores restocked today so i think and i think people

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:53.880
are calming down a little bit so hopefully that stuff is not going to be as well they're also

02:19:53.880 --> 02:19:59.640
putting like restrictions on stuff and i know like when i went over i had to go grocery shopping this

02:19:59.640 --> 02:20:05.960
week and so when i went there they're training tons of people to do the you know picking orders

02:20:05.960 --> 02:20:14.120
for the pull up and drive up and delivery and um it's still over out of like everything but i'm

02:20:14.120 --> 02:20:18.200
assuming that eventually it'll get better once they're not letting everybody just run rampant

02:20:18.200 --> 02:20:23.560
and take everything i will say this too for people who are having a hard time getting some things

02:20:25.240 --> 02:20:32.120
if you have a asian markets near you um mexican grocery stores uh indian markets

02:20:32.760 --> 02:20:40.360
those are actually amazing places to get meat um you know you might have to be a little bit more

02:20:40.360 --> 02:20:46.440
for either kosher or halal at some of the places um middle eastern markets for example but those

02:20:46.440 --> 02:20:53.560
are great places to stock up on some things and i have seen the uh paper staples there as well so

02:20:53.560 --> 02:20:58.280
you know just might not have ever been in there might look a little different than what you're

02:20:58.280 --> 02:21:02.840
used to but they're good places to look for these things yeah you know how i live in kind of like

02:21:02.840 --> 02:21:07.400
a very korean part of town like all the korean shops and restaurants around here apparently

02:21:07.400 --> 02:21:11.640
oh yeah go to the smile market yeah apparently over at smile that's like the place you can still

02:21:11.640 --> 02:21:15.320
get toilet paper so i thought that was kind of interesting at least that's what they said on next

02:21:15.320 --> 02:21:19.480
door now that that came out though it's probably gone because usually when i think to go to the

02:21:19.480 --> 02:21:24.520
korean market i go all the way to the gigantic they have this place called kp plaza for those

02:21:24.520 --> 02:21:29.240
that you know don't live here uh which is like two supermarkets because it literally used to be like

02:21:29.240 --> 02:21:34.120
a ralphson another supermarket it's two supermarkets fused together that is like nothing but international

02:21:34.120 --> 02:21:39.000
stuff and that's where i usually go when i want to go to like a korean or a i'll just go to the

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:45.560
huge one that's like everything the united nations of food except i was very disappointed when i

02:21:45.560 --> 02:21:51.960
went there last time i could not find stroopwafel when i was there i have to go to the but that's

02:21:51.960 --> 02:21:55.480
getting more and more popular at the regular store i found i found stroopwafel just a save

02:21:55.480 --> 02:22:05.080
mark the other day also places like home goods ross um marshall's owns home goods on tuesday

02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:14.440
morning they've actually had things like pasta um packaged non uh non-refrigerables um you know

02:22:14.440 --> 02:22:18.840
like i found like some good indian food and rice and i found truffle pasta at home goods

02:22:19.400 --> 02:22:26.440
um they have seasoning and spices there rob they have coffee at um your k-cups perfect um so

02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:32.440
people may not think of those places but totally look at those places um you're if you've got a

02:22:32.440 --> 02:22:37.960
cost plus world market near you go there they've got coffee and tea and international stuff and

02:22:37.960 --> 02:22:43.640
sausages and things so think outside the box if you're running out of your staples just saying

02:22:44.360 --> 02:22:49.240
all right well i think with those uh notes my final thought uh because i have to say it at

02:22:49.240 --> 02:22:53.640
some point would be if you enjoyed uh orange entre do don't forget to uh help us spread the word we

02:22:53.640 --> 02:22:57.720

02:22:57.720 --> 02:23:03.160
where every gamer has a voice but we can't get those voices out there um if the folks don't know

02:23:03.160 --> 02:23:08.520

02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:29.880
sharing the spotify link or anything like that all of that goes an awful long way i have the last

02:23:29.880 --> 02:23:35.080
bit the last bit of uh breaking news here right apparently harvey weinstein has tested positive

02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:43.720
for coronavirus in jail oh oh i heard that that was a little earlier so and uh ran paul

02:23:43.720 --> 02:23:50.120
how is it too couldn't happen to better people i i don't know why my brain immediately went to harvey

02:23:50.120 --> 02:23:56.520
firestein no god no no no and i got really concerned for a minute i was like no please but

02:23:56.520 --> 02:24:01.240
then when you said harvey weinstein tried to come for tom hanks i mean harvey weinstein i was like

02:24:01.240 --> 02:24:07.000
oh whatever for the record uh tom hanks posted today that he and his wife are doing a lot better

02:24:07.640 --> 02:24:17.720
and has been using that uh his uh his uh platform to uh to you know encourage others and show them

02:24:17.800 --> 02:24:22.520
what to do during this situation but the problem with um with wine is that it

02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:28.840
indicates a wider spread at rikers so oh yeah so just keep that in mind although

02:24:28.840 --> 02:24:33.560
fucking karma it's the the testing being unavailable means a lot more people have

02:24:33.560 --> 02:24:36.920
this than what's being reported i mean just look at what's happening amongst the famous people

02:24:36.920 --> 02:24:42.520
it's adrice elba daniel dae kim um what's her name from the old madonna movies debbie maser

02:24:42.520 --> 02:24:48.440
uh you know a lot a lot of these folks have it and you know like what you know a lot we

02:24:48.440 --> 02:24:52.200
we hear about them because they usually i mean a lot of them go out of their way to say i didn't

02:24:52.200 --> 02:24:56.840
do anything special to get a test or whatever but a lot of these guys you know can get testing a

02:24:56.840 --> 02:25:02.120
little easier so i think we're hearing more about it so um yeah anyways just it's just kind of scary

02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:07.400
but just that this is why we're staying home you know uh don't let's let's try to end this thing

02:25:07.480 --> 02:25:12.520
