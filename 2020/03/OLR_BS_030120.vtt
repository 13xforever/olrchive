Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:27.000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki!

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, not live tonight for a special bonus stage episode,

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
but this is the episode that will be airing at our Twitch channel on March the 1st of 2020.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
So happy March! We're kind of fast-forwarding in time.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
We're doing the time warp again with myself, Rob Roberts, and over there, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
Hi. Hi, how are you? My brain is pulp.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
I know, we all had to work today. Usually when we do this show, we don't have to work, like, earlier in the day, but today we had to work.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
I'm in the middle of training. Oh, fun! That's my job. Sort of.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
It's so funny that, like, because I normally work 4x10, and I'm working 5x8 this week,

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
I'm only three days in, and I'm more tired than I would have been on a normal work day.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
I'm hoping at some point I can switch my schedule to 4x10, because that's a thing we're allowed to do,

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
but just, you know, it hasn't logistically made sense yet.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
But I at least wore my death metal shirt today, which was awesome.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
Awesome. Alright, and also say hello to TechMasterLoki. Hello.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
Who's dressed up in a little button-down shirt like me? I have a gamer shirt under it.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
I do that too. I wear a lot of gamer shirts, except I don't remember what I have on today.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
I think it's just a plain one, but a lot of times I wear gamer t-shirts and stuff underneath.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
Okay, there you go. So we're all, I know you can't see it unless you're on our Twitch channel.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
You just happen to be there Sunday night, because we do usually tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific,

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
9 o'clock Eastern, right after Bobby Black Wolf at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vognetwork,

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
also available at vognetwork.com. Our next live show, we will return on March 15th.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
But I, how dare I, I booked a cruise, as I've been saying on the show for the past few weeks,

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
so I'm going to be gone for a little bit. And I think, Jamie, you said you're going to a sister's thing one of these nights as well, right?

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
I thought that was a thing. Maybe I made that up. No, that's in April. Okay, well.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
But I might be going to a GDC after party. Well, there you go. Oh, so GDC is still happening.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
I've been hearing in the news this week that more and more companies are back. I think it's more stats.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
I'm just going to go to the parties, but it's a Sony party, so I don't know if that got cancelled.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
But I got a confirmation about it today. It's like the LGBT inclusion party.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
Cool. And no, it's sponsored by Microsoft. Never mind. But that's that's quite the mix up, my friend.

02:51.000 --> 02:58.000
I can't brain. I have the Lurgy. It was the it was the Nintendo PlayStation box.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
I used up all my logic, learning logic. It's fine. It's fine. Anyway, where was I?

03:03.000 --> 03:10.000
I went on a tangent. I was talking about how Loki and I kind of look different on the feed today just because we're kind of we're doing this right after work.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
So it's like any different. Well, no, because you're the voice. You're the voice off camera.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
You're the mystery. But I'm actually not wearing anything different than what I would normally wear anyway, because my work doesn't have a dress code.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
Yeah, you're you're well, we OK. We legit do not have a dress.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
It says in our H.R. that there is no dress code.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
Well, the dress code where I'm at is basically make good choices. But here's what it's really about.

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
I'm wearing slightly nicer clothes because I can't wear anything that is going to go on the cruise with us.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
So like my jeans, I can't wear. So I have to wear like the nice because we're not going to the tropics.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
I'm not bringing this as much as I like this button up. Sure. It's one of my favorites. Not taking this all the way to the Bahamas.

03:49.000 --> 03:56.000
So I'm kind of wearing these clothes now because the other ones are starting to where we're actually packing, not the night before.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
I'm very proud of Alan and I. We've already started the packing process. So, yeah.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
So some of my clothes are already packed, basically. So otherwise I would wear like jeans or something more.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
I think I owe exactly three button ups and two of them are flannel. But you got one on now is a flannel.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Yeah, that's good. All right. Anyway, enough about fashion.

04:14.000 --> 04:21.000
Let's talk about video games because we are going to talk about some of the things that have happened so far in this week.

04:21.000 --> 04:28.000
We're about halfway through the week when we're taping this show. But again, this show is going to air on Twitch on March 1st.

04:28.000 --> 04:34.000
So some big things may have happened, but it may not have happened yet at the night we're taping this.

04:34.000 --> 04:41.000
So if we missed a headline or two, we'll catch up on all the big stories when we return live on March 15th over on Twitch.

04:41.000 --> 04:48.000
But for now, let's talk about one of the bigger stories that's happened so far this week and it has to do with Xbox Series X, a Microsoft story.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
Microsoft actually put out a new blog post that's teasing some more features.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
It's starting to tease a little more about what's really inside it and so forth.

04:58.000 --> 05:06.000
So for example, I think this is actually a new confirmation, 12 teraflops of GPU performance.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
Of course, I have no idea. How does one measure a teraflop?

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
I don't know.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
Five hundred thirty-five thousand floppy minutes? I don't know.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
It's a processor. It's how fast it processes information, but I don't know.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
You said you saw some post earlier.

05:22.000 --> 05:29.000
There was someone that was posting something saying it was about as powerful as 165 Gamecubes or something like that.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
And they had like a picture, like a graphic of Gamecubes taped together.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
But it still wasn't as powerful as it. It was like close. It was like twelve something.

05:38.000 --> 05:45.000
So you can maybe run 164 different windows with Smash Brothers Melee on it, but not 165.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
That's too many.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
165 Gamecubes, that's like the size of the original Xbox.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
So they are saying four times more powerful than the Xbox One.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
And it's got some pretty nice specs in it.

06:00.000 --> 06:08.000
Yeah, NVMe SSD, which we kind of knew about the SSD already, which is going to help speed up load times.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
Although I'm also hearing that the SSD, because I was seeing a different story,

06:12.000 --> 06:20.000
kind of a somewhat unrelated story about how Sony is struggling with cost issues on the PlayStation 5.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
Now obviously nothing's confirmed. This is all like rumor stuff from investor forecasters and things like that.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
But apparently the SSD supply issue is something that's coming into question.

06:30.000 --> 06:39.000
And I don't know if that's related to COVID or if that's because of just certain technological parts kind of go in and out of demand.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
Like remember when everybody was buying up the graphic cards for fucking Bitcoin?

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Yeah, all that stuff. So I don't know if the SSD is something like that.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
They're popular.

06:46.000 --> 06:53.000
Yeah, perhaps. But anyway, so Xbox Series X is planning to have the NVMe SSD.

06:53.000 --> 07:04.000
Now what also was very interesting and probably one of the highlights of the post that people were spreading around was their technology, if you want, called Smart Delivery.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
That's how they're branding it.

07:05.000 --> 07:14.000
And so Smart Delivery is you buy the game once and you play the best version possible either on the Series X or the Xbox One.

07:14.000 --> 07:21.000
So for example, Halo Infinite. Let's say you're not ready to buy Xbox Series X because maybe it's going to be an expensive console.

07:21.000 --> 07:31.000
And usually, especially when this last generation of games wasn't readily backwards compatible, Xbox One got there eventually.

07:31.000 --> 07:37.000
But remember it launched when Phil Spencer wasn't CEO. It launched without backwards compatibility and it never came to PlayStation 4.

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
So right now there's a lot of mindset out there that if you buy a console, you don't get to play your old games again.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
Or, well, I'm going to wait and just buy this on a new console.

07:46.000 --> 07:56.000
It's kind of going to be changing the way of thinking because now if I'm not ready to buy the Xbox Series X yet, but I buy Halo Infinite now for my Xbox One,

07:56.000 --> 08:03.000
I'll be able to play it on Xbox Series X. Not only just play the same version, but play the enhanced version.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
Yeah, I've got to wonder if that's going to go away at some point.

08:06.000 --> 08:13.000
I don't think so because honestly, this is how it kind of should work because that's how PCs.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
This has been a strong argument in favor of PCs. You upgrade your graphics card and your game plays better.

08:18.000 --> 08:27.000
But eventually, game performance, like PCs, eventually that lower end keeps going up and up and up.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
I see, so eventually the game can't really be made for Xbox One anymore.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Yes.

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
Well, I wonder if that's where they're going to start, and they haven't said this yet, but I wonder if that's where they're going to start relying on cloud.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
So this game doesn't run on the Xbox One, but we'll run it through the cloud.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Maybe.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
And I wonder if that's the ultimate answer we end up with for Microsoft.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Maybe by the time we get to that point, you know.

08:48.000 --> 08:55.000
Smart, they are also saying it's not necessarily going to be for every title. They can only really guarantee it for their titles.

08:55.000 --> 09:04.000
So the company says Smart Delivery will be standard for Xbox Game Studio titles, and it'll be available for third party developers to implement.

09:04.000 --> 09:10.000
I believe Cyberpunk has already come out and said they will be one of those games that supports the Smart Delivery.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
So some third parties are already getting on this, but it's not guaranteed.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
And I especially imagine in the indie universe it might be a little trickier.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
You know, I don't know how...

09:19.000 --> 09:26.000
Well, and also some of those might not necessarily be making an enhanced version as well, so it might be easier for them, who knows.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Very true.

09:27.000 --> 09:36.000
Some other features they're talking about with Xbox Series X, they want to do a quick resume capability, which will let you jump back into multiple titles from where you left off.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
Now you can kind of do this right now on Xbox One and PlayStation 4, they're kind of the same.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
And Switch.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Oh yeah, and Switch, right?

09:43.000 --> 09:51.000
Well, where my brain goes on PlayStation 4 is it's really good with multitasking one game and a TV service.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
So for example, I've been mentioning on the show the past couple of weeks I've been playing a lot of No Man's Sky, right?

09:55.000 --> 10:05.000
Well, what I might do is when I'm sick of playing No Man's Sky and I just want to veg on the couch and surf my phone, maybe I'll switch to Twitch and I'll watch one of my streamer buddies on Twitch.

10:05.000 --> 10:15.000
Well, then when I go back to No Man's Sky, I pick up right where I left off. It picks up the suspend, so it doesn't have to reload my save file, because the save files take a long time to load in that game.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
So I go right back to where I left off, which is kind of nice.

10:19.000 --> 10:29.000
So imagine you could do that, but with multiple games. Like you have your Halo is suspended here, your Cyberpunk is suspended here, Ori is suspended here, you can kind of go back and forth.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
That's kind of neat.

10:31.000 --> 10:40.000
I don't think it's a game changer, but it's kind of one of those, again, well, when you minimize a window in Windows or Mac, whatever, but I say Windows because Microsoft does Windows.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I see more and more cross.

10:42.000 --> 10:50.000
I mean, I just hope it works better than loading multiple games at one time because that usually tanks performance because you have multiple games running at the same time.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
True, very true.

10:51.000 --> 11:00.000
But, I mean, it's not a deal breaker if it didn't work like that. My expectation is as long as it works like it does now, then that's fine.

11:00.000 --> 11:12.000
And then one other thing that they talked about in the blog post is Dynamic Latency Input, or DLI, inside the wireless controller to reduce the delay between the buttons you're pressing and what appears on the screen.

11:12.000 --> 11:24.000
So what they're trying to do is basically make the connection between the Bluetooth controller that you use and the TV instantaneous, basically, which I don't feel like it's really been a problem.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
You can play music games on wireless controllers and it's fine.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
You might have to adjust the timing or whatever, but it's usually pretty good.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
So I wonder if they are trying to narrow that down, though, to help with the cloud.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
I imagine it's not something that's going to be as noticeable in your living room as it will be for the cloud.

11:42.000 --> 11:49.000
Because, again, in my limited use of Google Stadia, although I've played a few things, it finally ran out.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
So I don't have Google Stadia Pro anymore. It ran out, right?

11:52.000 --> 11:59.000
I didn't re-up it for three more months, which, by the way, you're automatically subscribed when you sign up for it.

11:59.000 --> 12:05.000
So turn it off. You don't have to talk to anybody or call anybody. You just have to go in and turn it off, or it's going to re-sub.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
And it might have already done that for you. Just check, unless you want to keep it.

12:09.000 --> 12:15.000
But anyway, with Stadia, I've played things like Thumper, which is kind of a music horror game, I believe they describe it as, right?

12:15.000 --> 12:22.000
It plays fine, which is the most impressive part of Stadia's technology in many ways, is that there really is an input lag.

12:22.000 --> 12:30.000
So I wonder if this is kind of part of that as well. So it's neat, and it sounds like a cool direction for Microsoft.

12:30.000 --> 12:40.000
And that's really all I have to say about these updates. But what I think is also notable about all of this is that it's keeping Microsoft's name out there.

12:40.000 --> 12:47.000
It's getting the blog posts written about them and so forth. And on the other side, Sony, still kind of a question mark.

12:47.000 --> 12:53.000
Which I don't think is the end of the world. I really feel like we were doing the same song and dance.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Who wants to do a song and dance?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
That's a very different show.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Some people are into that.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
Stay tuned. Late nights at ball game work. Just kidding. We don't want to get banned from Twitch.

13:02.000 --> 13:08.000
But the same old song and dance when it was the Nintendo Switch, because I'm almost positive.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
We were like, when's Nintendo going to show it? When are they going to fucking show it?

13:12.000 --> 13:18.000
Like, are they ever going to announce this goddamn thing? And then they finally did, like, six weeks before it came out.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
And it was, they didn't have a problem.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Yeah.

13:22.000 --> 13:29.000
And Sony has followed in the path of Nintendo on a couple things. I would say the Nintendo Directs being one of them.

13:29.000 --> 13:36.000
And changing their E3 strategy. Although we know Nintendo still does E3, they don't do conferences at E3 anymore.

13:36.000 --> 13:45.000
So do you think they'll announce after Microsoft, like, especially when Microsoft announces price points and stuff, just to kind of like undercut them?

13:45.000 --> 13:51.000
I do think Sony's waiting to hear the price because now this is a rumor.

13:51.000 --> 14:02.000
But the rumor is that when that E3 happened all those years ago, when, you know, Sony basically punched Xbox in the kidney after, you know, their performance.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
And undercut them by $100 and had all those videos about that.

14:06.000 --> 14:12.000
The rumor is that Sony had three presentations ready to go at three different prices.

14:12.000 --> 14:19.000
And they were waiting for Microsoft to reveal theirs before they revealed, because, and they, it was the night, the next day.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
So it was like Microsoft did like Monday or whatever, and Sony was on Tuesday.

14:22.000 --> 14:28.000
So once they heard Microsoft's price, they made a decision Tuesday morning, this is the price, and they went with that presentation.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
But they had three presentations ready to go.

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
One was $100 higher and the other was $100 lower. I don't know how that would have played out, but yeah.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
So, interesting, huh?

14:37.000 --> 14:46.000
Anyway, that is a rumor, but it's one of those, if we want to, on this very special bonus episode of Orange Lawn's radio, as much as I hate what this has turned into,

14:46.000 --> 14:55.000
if we want to bring back the plausibility scale for a night, the fact that Sony had three different presentations ready to go and they picked after Microsoft went,

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
I would give a mostly green light on the plausibility scale.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
What about you?

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Yeah. Yeah, it's plausible.

15:02.000 --> 15:09.000
Yeah. And I, so the fact that maybe they're making a similar type of game of chicken, of wait and see, I think is very possible.

15:09.000 --> 15:17.000
Especially because Microsoft has now committed themselves, essentially, to revealing the price and all of the details at E3.

15:17.000 --> 15:23.000
Sony hasn't. And all this stuff about Sony's going to do an event in February, Sony's going to do an event in March,

15:23.000 --> 15:29.000
it's either off of what Sony has done before, which I know is ironic because we literally just use the plausibility scale.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
They could still do that and talk about the system, but not announce the price.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
That's very true. That's very true. They could.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
They could do something like this where they just talk about it does this and this and this.

15:39.000 --> 15:45.000
And yes, it does look like a giant U-shaped, or I guess they're saying a V for five in Roman.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
Do you think it's, that's, I mean, y'all have seen the dev kits, right?

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
They're like, I would hope it's sleeker looking than that, because that, that thing looks like ridiculous.

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
That thing looks like a beast. Just put it in, just like, it doesn't need the U-shape.

15:59.000 --> 16:04.000
Just put it in a PC tower case, like make it like with LEDs and stuff on it.

16:04.000 --> 16:09.000
Put a big, like, it just looks weird, but that, that's a dev kit.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
So, you know, no, I know we shouldn't, we can't base anything off the dev kit, but you have to wonder, you have to,

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
you do have to wonder because like, why shape the dev kill? Like that's weird too.

16:18.000 --> 16:23.000
Like dev kits are usually in like a PC tower case. So it's like, you know,

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
Sony could get us to shut the fuck up about this by just showing us the console,

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
but that's, that's what, that's what the next few months are going to be like until it's going to be a giant boomerang,

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
like the boomerang controller for the PlayStation three that never happened.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
Oh my God. Look, I forgot about those, the boomerang controller.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Those things are actually kind of cool.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
The Batarang.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
The Batarang. Do you remember those dark soccer? They're at that one E3.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
They looked uncomfortable.

16:47.000 --> 16:52.000
They did, but they were kind of rad. Like I was like, I could, I could fuck up the Riddler with one of these.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Yeah, probably.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
That's cool. Bring hashtag, bring back the Batarang for a PlayStation five.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
Although we already know it's going to be like the same damn controller, but with, you know,

17:02.000 --> 17:08.000
it sounds like maybe the haptic feedback type of thing, which is cool. I mean, in the reality that is probably the better solution.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
So, um, yeah, I, uh, it's going to be interesting to see Sony make their counter move,

17:14.000 --> 17:26.000
but I think one thing we should all kind of be ready for is that they might not like Sony really could wait until after E3 to launch.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
Well, they can't, obviously they can't go that far, but they can go up to like maybe two months before.

17:31.000 --> 17:36.000
I don't know. Do you know this from having been on the other side, the retail, the retail distribution side of things?

17:36.000 --> 17:42.000
I mean, I know the industry is much different from when you were in it, but like how much lead time does a big distributor need for like,

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Oh, I got to put hardware on my shelf.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Oh, they don't tell us until the very end.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Okay.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
Until they've already made their announcement most of the time, unless you're a big retailer.

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
Um, but I've like, I had conversations with this one, I don't remember like the details of it, but there,

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
it was all the way back to the Sega Genesis launch or maybe his master system,

18:00.000 --> 18:08.000
but they're talking about like, he was on the product launch team for that and talking about like how they came up with the starter pack thing that they had or something like that.

18:08.000 --> 18:15.000
And how, like literally the announcement was like a banner on the roof or something like that of, you know, Sega, but he's talking about all the craziness behind that.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
So then sometimes they don't really know what the plan is going to be until they do the plan.

18:19.000 --> 18:25.000
Um, you know, kind of going back to the three presentation theory there, but.

18:26.000 --> 18:32.000
Yeah, like, well, you know, small distributors and you're not going to get heads up because they know that shit gonna leak.

18:32.000 --> 18:39.000
So of course they're not telling anybody until they make the announcement, then they'll send you the details if you're lucky.

18:39.000 --> 18:46.000
So, but so at the end of the day, if Sony send you like the skews to set it up or whatever, but that's about it.

18:46.000 --> 18:53.000
If Sony wanted to wait till July or August to announce the console, it's not going to hurt them in the long run.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Nope.

18:54.000 --> 18:59.000
So that's a reality we should, especially like in August, when you have, I don't know if they're going to games com still.

18:59.000 --> 19:04.000
So, you know, games com would be a really good time for them to pull the curtain back on it.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Yeah, you're right.

19:05.000 --> 19:12.000
They're going to, I would say, I would say games com is when you're going to get a beefy amount of information.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Yeah. Yeah.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Well, yeah.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
And by then, hopefully you'll have more third parties announcing titles for the PlayStation five as well.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
And we could get something at GDC.

19:22.000 --> 19:27.000
Sony has done GDC announcements before PlayStation home. Wasn't VR.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
PlayStation VR was a GDC announcement, wasn't it?

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
I don't remember.

19:30.000 --> 19:35.000
They have, and usually they've been or move or one of the things was like a GDC announcement.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
I would be curious about the next PlayStation VR as well.

19:38.000 --> 19:45.000
It is possible by the time we do our next show, or even by the time people are hearing this because of GDC, they may have said some stuff.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
So we'll see.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
They're waiting.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
And we're going to sound real stupid.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
They're waiting.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
They're waiting for us to go on breakthrough.

19:50.000 --> 19:57.000
Now that's all the things do it now, now, now, now nobody listens to him, but it's still, we're going to fuck him over anyways.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
I love it.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
So we'll see.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Stay tuned.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Uh, but if it's, if it's a little more time, then it's a little more time.

20:03.000 --> 20:11.000
I didn't want to mention though, like, cause usually when you have, um, consoles launch and stuff that the hardware that they put in them is kind of like current gen hardware.

20:11.000 --> 20:18.000
But what's kind of neat though about that, our DNA, uh, GPU is that it is the brand new architecture that hasn't even launched yet.

20:18.000 --> 20:24.000
So that's like new, new, new cutting edge, new for like the, uh, GPU, which is pretty awesome.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Huh.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
That is cool.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
All right.

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
Well, let's move on and talk about things, uh, not so new, but maybe a little new.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
It's the types of games we've been playing this week.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
So let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Dark Sakura.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
How was your gaming week so far?

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Lots of ghosts and goblins.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
Cool.

20:42.000 --> 20:50.000
And then the usual cell phone stuff.

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
I really have been just so brain dead with all the stuff that I have going on right now.

20:55.000 --> 21:03.000
However, I did do something kind of gaming related that maybe the listeners will hear before too long.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
You can talk about it.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
It's fine.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
Well, I worked on a theme song for the show.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Yeah.

21:09.000 --> 21:14.000
Well, I was supposed to be paying attention in my class today.

21:14.000 --> 21:20.000
So there's, yeah, I've heard the draft of a Dark Sakura created theme song and it's, it's good.

21:20.000 --> 21:25.000
Like it's, you know, it's, um, yeah, we gotta, we gotta just, you know, the timing.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Yeah.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Yeah.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
I'm excited for everybody to hear it.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
So stay tuned.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
And then poking a couple of somebodies.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Yes.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Yes.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
Obviously voiceover guy, Jason will still be here to do the voiceovers every week, but

21:36.000 --> 21:41.000
we need a new voice for the, um, you know, it's orange lounge radio with dark Sakura,

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Robert, you know, and that whole thing.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
So, uh, not that we don't appreciate what MIDI had did for us.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Oh yes.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
And stream him on Spotify, support him please.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
He's helped us out a bunch over the years, but it's just, we've had that theme song for

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
over 10 years.

21:54.000 --> 21:59.000
It's time for, and I got to play a lot in logic, which was fun.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
I, the more I use it, the more I really enjoy it.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
So, so we'll see.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Yep.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
But that's what I was doing.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
All right.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
How about you, Loki?

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Um, I just played more Minecraft with the kids.

22:10.000 --> 22:16.360
So on our realm that we have, um, I went to the nether and tried to find another fortress

22:16.360 --> 22:22.360
and I was like, okay, well I'm going to make a, you know, a portal to this nether fortress.

22:22.360 --> 22:26.200
And then of course, every block in the nether is eight blocks in the surface.

22:26.200 --> 22:33.680
And like, I literally walked for like five, five days in there and I still wasn't close

22:33.680 --> 22:38.200
to where I was supposed to the actual village that we're in.

22:38.200 --> 22:46.000
So I just gave up and killed myself so I could spawn back at the village cause I'm like,

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
this is taking too long.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.880
They're like, you're never going to get back, you're just gone forever.

22:50.880 --> 22:58.400
So it's like, well, well, I'll find another one that's closer.

22:58.400 --> 23:00.400
So I was doing that.

23:00.400 --> 23:01.400
All right.

23:01.400 --> 23:02.400
That it?

23:02.400 --> 23:03.400
Oh, an ornament.

23:04.120 --> 23:07.640
I'm upgrading a level 10 weapon, so I have to wait three days for that stupid thing.

23:07.640 --> 23:08.640
Oh gosh.

23:08.640 --> 23:09.640
Wow.

23:09.640 --> 23:10.640
I never had, it ends tonight though.

23:10.640 --> 23:11.640
So, okay.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.880
I was like, I don't have enough material to do past like level four or five.

23:13.880 --> 23:14.880
So wow.

23:14.880 --> 23:15.880
Good for you.

23:15.880 --> 23:16.880
Yeah.

23:16.880 --> 23:17.880
Nice.

23:17.880 --> 23:18.880
All right.

23:18.880 --> 23:19.880
Don't take my land though.

23:19.880 --> 23:21.000
They need to do something like, you're right.

23:21.000 --> 23:26.200
There's like one person who has like easily half this town.

23:26.200 --> 23:32.160
So like they need to do something where like if he or she is not regularly going to that

23:32.160 --> 23:35.200
place, then they need like a deterioration mechanic.

23:35.200 --> 23:40.680
Like how an ingress portals decay, how in Pokemon go gyms, the Pokemon get weaker as

23:40.680 --> 23:41.680
time goes on.

23:41.680 --> 23:42.680
Right.

23:42.680 --> 23:43.680
Yeah.

23:43.680 --> 23:45.880
Orna really needs something like that because otherwise it's just about who claimed it the

23:45.880 --> 23:48.200
earliest and then leveled up to level two 50.

23:48.200 --> 23:49.200
So nobody can take them out.

23:49.200 --> 23:52.880
Oh, eventually I'll get to that point and then it's just going to be like, game on.

23:52.880 --> 23:53.880
It's just gone.

23:53.880 --> 23:54.880
Take it all over.

23:54.880 --> 23:55.880
Yeah.

23:55.880 --> 23:56.880
It's all mine.

23:56.880 --> 23:58.080
Declaring open war on what's her name.

23:58.080 --> 24:00.720
So I think Mike, the two, the shadow looks females.

24:00.720 --> 24:01.720
I don't know.

24:01.720 --> 24:02.720
I don't know who it does.

24:02.720 --> 24:03.720
It doesn't matter.

24:03.720 --> 24:04.720
Damn you.

24:04.720 --> 24:05.720
Auntie St. Mike.

24:05.720 --> 24:06.720
Their number is up.

24:06.720 --> 24:07.720
All right.

24:07.720 --> 24:08.800
Well, that's not the name I was thinking of.

24:08.800 --> 24:12.080
There's another name, like everywhere, like downtown and yeah.

24:12.080 --> 24:15.440
So my area is auntie St. Mike and the ghost of auntie St.

24:15.440 --> 24:16.440
Calleria or something like that.

24:16.440 --> 24:17.440
That's the one I see everywhere.

24:17.440 --> 24:22.480
And part of like, yeah, they have like, it's the something ornate, something of the burrito

24:22.480 --> 24:23.480
or I don't remember.

24:23.480 --> 24:25.560
Oh, they're a little, they're a little guilt.

24:25.560 --> 24:29.680
And look, I'm, I I'm all for, Hey, if people are going to be aggressive and want to play

24:29.680 --> 24:31.600
the game hard and control their territory.

24:31.600 --> 24:32.600
That's fine.

24:32.600 --> 24:33.600
That's what Ingress is all about.

24:33.600 --> 24:34.600
You know?

24:34.600 --> 24:38.600
But, uh, I just think the game shouldn't like reward somebody for just like you get really

24:38.600 --> 24:39.600
much.

24:39.600 --> 24:44.840
It's like you get 10 gold every day, but you can't create your own kingdom until you have

24:44.840 --> 24:46.280
100 pieces of land.

24:46.280 --> 24:47.680
You need a hundred reputation.

24:47.680 --> 24:49.260
Oh yeah.

24:49.260 --> 24:51.440
You can't create your own kingdom until you have a hundred.

24:51.440 --> 24:53.620
Oh, I didn't know you can even make a kingdom.

24:53.620 --> 24:55.680
So it's, it's a pain.

24:55.680 --> 24:56.680
All right.

24:56.680 --> 24:57.680
That it for your game week.

24:57.680 --> 24:58.680
That's it.

24:58.680 --> 24:59.680
That's it for this week.

24:59.680 --> 25:02.320
So, um, I haven't played a lot cause it's still early in the week, but continuing with

25:02.320 --> 25:05.880
Final Fantasy 14, cause I'm a nerd, got to get my tomes, kept my tomes.

25:05.880 --> 25:08.480
Uh, and then I've been playing no man's sky still just a little bit.

25:08.480 --> 25:10.920
I haven't been playing a lot this week, but what I did do.

25:10.920 --> 25:14.900
So do you guys remember on the last show I mentioned that I took, I took a really great

25:14.900 --> 25:17.580
screenshot and no man's sky that I loved.

25:17.580 --> 25:18.580
So guess what?

25:18.580 --> 25:23.600
So I decided to take my favorite virtual exploration game and combine it with my real world exploration

25:23.600 --> 25:24.600
game.

25:24.600 --> 25:28.620
So I made a banner in Ingress, a mission banner out of that screenshot.

25:28.620 --> 25:32.420
So I only had time to do the first row by walking around the park and sadly I can't

25:32.420 --> 25:34.500
put this on screen yet, but that's what it looks like.

25:34.500 --> 25:38.860
So yeah, if you want to see that you can actually see it's a little screenshot from the game

25:38.860 --> 25:42.660
and actually you can see my little Explorer there in the corner and uh, yeah, I thought

25:42.660 --> 25:43.660
that was really cool.

25:43.660 --> 25:44.660
So, uh, yeah.

25:44.660 --> 25:48.540
Now I just have to finish the rest of it because once I do the, uh, cause I did the walk, it's,

25:48.540 --> 25:51.780
it's one part walking and then you have to kind of drive a big loop around town just

25:51.780 --> 25:53.420
cause it's the only way I can get enough portals.

25:53.420 --> 25:56.280
I didn't want to do like another banner downtown.

25:56.280 --> 25:57.280
There's already like a million of them.

25:57.480 --> 26:00.400
So I did this one on the East side of town, like McKinley park, if you know where that

26:00.400 --> 26:03.840
is, that's where this one of the all like that's, you have to walk that park to get

26:03.840 --> 26:04.840
that first part.

26:04.840 --> 26:09.100
Um, and then it's, or it's the lady, it's the lady bird park.

26:09.100 --> 26:12.360
If you saw the movie, it's the Rose garden that they have a scene in.

26:12.360 --> 26:17.600
I used to walk around that park every day at lunch when I worked at the cannery.

26:17.600 --> 26:18.880
Yeah, it's a lovely park.

26:18.880 --> 26:23.040
So mission four or something of that mission starts at that Rose garden.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.040
So there you go.

26:24.040 --> 26:27.160
A little, a little, uh, so if you've seen that movie, you know what I'm talking about.

26:27.520 --> 26:31.120
Um, but anyway, uh, so that, that mission series is there and I'm looking forward to

26:31.120 --> 26:34.920
doing the rest of it, which will have the kind of like Saturn looking planet behind

26:34.920 --> 26:35.920
it with the rings.

26:35.920 --> 26:36.920
It's very giant.

26:36.920 --> 26:39.200
And this, this kind of the solar burst, I'm really excited to do that.

26:39.200 --> 26:42.120
I like being able to mix my favorite games together like that.

26:42.120 --> 26:43.120
So cool.

26:43.120 --> 26:44.120
Yeah, it's fun.

26:44.120 --> 26:45.120
Anyway.

26:45.120 --> 26:46.120
All right.

26:46.120 --> 26:47.120
So that was my gaming week.

26:47.120 --> 26:49.440
Let's get into some of the headlines this week so far.

26:49.440 --> 26:50.440
Yes.

26:50.440 --> 26:54.560
So unfortunately we're going to start with some sad news.

26:54.560 --> 27:04.480
So the creator of the Konami code, uh, Kazu, um, Hisha Hashimoto has died at age 61.

27:04.480 --> 27:05.480
That's pretty young.

27:05.480 --> 27:08.240
All things considered 61 is not old.

27:08.240 --> 27:12.680
The age is actually disputed because it either says 61 or 79, depending on what source you

27:12.680 --> 27:13.680
look at.

27:13.680 --> 27:14.680
Oh, that's a huge discrepancy.

27:14.680 --> 27:15.680
Yeah.

27:15.680 --> 27:16.680
It's a big discrepancy.

27:16.680 --> 27:17.680
Big discrepancy.

27:17.680 --> 27:18.680
Right.

27:18.680 --> 27:19.680
Regardless.

27:19.680 --> 27:23.500
Uh, still sad to hear, but, uh, I didn't know, I guess I never knew that the actual code

27:23.540 --> 27:25.620
was attributed to like one person.

27:25.620 --> 27:26.620
I have to admit I did.

27:26.620 --> 27:27.620
I did not know.

27:27.620 --> 27:28.620
Did you know that Jim?

27:28.620 --> 27:29.620
Maybe you did.

27:29.620 --> 27:30.620
I didn't know it was attributed to just one person.

27:30.620 --> 27:35.140
I thought it was just some type of like nebulous internal, you know, sometimes those old cheat

27:35.140 --> 27:36.500
codes from back in the day.

27:36.500 --> 27:41.100
But how many people were actually programmers on games during the NES era?

27:41.100 --> 27:42.100
True.

27:42.100 --> 27:43.100
True.

27:43.100 --> 27:44.100
True.

27:44.100 --> 27:45.100
No, you're right.

27:45.100 --> 27:46.100
Or in the Atari 2600 era.

27:46.100 --> 27:47.100
Right.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.620
It was like one person made all those games or what, or would do a game.

27:48.620 --> 27:51.460
Um, and, um, in the NES era, you're right.

27:51.460 --> 27:54.860
It would be a small team, probably 10 or less that would make those games.

27:54.860 --> 27:55.860
So that's true.

27:55.860 --> 28:01.620
Um, and a lot of those old codes kind of came from, they were like bug testing or dev codes

28:01.620 --> 28:02.700
basically.

28:02.700 --> 28:06.460
So like other people weren't supposed to know the code.

28:06.460 --> 28:08.820
So was Gradius the first game to use it?

28:08.820 --> 28:09.820
Probably had to have been.

28:09.820 --> 28:10.820
Right.

28:10.820 --> 28:11.820
So use up.

28:11.820 --> 28:12.820
Yeah.

28:12.820 --> 28:13.820
Up, up, down, left, right, left, right, B, A start.

28:13.820 --> 28:15.380
And that is what gets your ship all the like full power and everything.

28:15.380 --> 28:18.940
So you can, you know, test the level a different way than having to earn it all.

28:18.940 --> 28:23.340
So, and a lot of old cheat codes and I think even passwords and things like that were for

28:23.340 --> 28:24.340
this.

28:24.340 --> 28:28.940
Um, and they just would get left in the game because you know, back in the day it wasn't

28:28.940 --> 28:32.660
as easy to just patch things out, you know, or things like that.

28:32.660 --> 28:36.900
So they would just get left in the game and then eventually someone squeals, you know,

28:36.900 --> 28:40.260
one of those devs tells their friend, you know, you can do this, you know, and then

28:40.260 --> 28:43.020
that friend tells another friend and word spreads around.

28:43.020 --> 28:46.980
I mean, I have a hard time believing somebody that word spreads to game pro magazine and

28:47.020 --> 28:48.020
Exactly.

28:48.020 --> 28:52.260
Or, or, you know, when, and I bet this technique was used.

28:52.260 --> 28:53.260
Absolutely.

28:53.260 --> 28:58.580
When sales of the game start slowing down, Oh, did you know there's a code generate interest

28:58.580 --> 29:02.060
in the game again, get it printed in the next magazine so people can rent it or check it

29:02.060 --> 29:03.060
out.

29:03.060 --> 29:06.580
I'm absolutely sure that was part of the strategy back in the day.

29:06.580 --> 29:11.220
Now it's, you know, sell them, sell them an unlock code for 99 cents.

29:11.220 --> 29:12.220
But

29:12.900 --> 29:18.460
And then we've got news that platinum games is publishing its own original game under

29:18.460 --> 29:25.380
the working title project GG is that unlike any of the games we've made so far, it's going

29:25.380 --> 29:32.120
to be a hundred percent platinum games title for everything from its yeah, for everything

29:32.120 --> 29:37.820
from its setting to its characters and its game design and story to how it's promoted.

29:37.820 --> 29:40.220
Platinum games is in full control.

29:40.220 --> 29:42.700
And by the time this airs, they'll know what it is.

29:42.700 --> 29:43.700
Right.

29:43.700 --> 29:46.460
Cause I believe I heard platinum is pulling back the curtain on it tomorrow.

29:46.460 --> 29:47.820
So yeah, they have a teaser.

29:47.820 --> 29:51.660
So we'll have to wait and see, unfortunately you guys know something we don't know yet.

29:51.660 --> 29:54.280
So I'm hearing a lot of chatter.

29:54.280 --> 29:59.660
People think it might be beautiful Joe, another entry in the beautiful Joe series, but I mean,

29:59.660 --> 30:00.660
it could be an original IP.

30:00.660 --> 30:03.700
It looks a little more screenshots that they have.

30:03.700 --> 30:08.540
Don't look like beautiful Joe, but wait and see where things have happened.

30:08.540 --> 30:09.980
So yeah, we'll see.

30:09.980 --> 30:15.060
I'm all, I'm all for original IP or what if it's, um, fucking, especially because they

30:15.060 --> 30:17.280
say a hundred percent platinum and it's all plaid.

30:17.280 --> 30:18.700
What if it's scaled down?

30:18.700 --> 30:22.380
Remember how Microsoft stopped that way?

30:22.380 --> 30:25.620
Cause that's the one thing I'm going to read into a little bit is how they say it's a hundred

30:25.620 --> 30:26.620
percent platinum.

30:26.620 --> 30:27.620
It's all platinum.

30:27.620 --> 30:29.460
Like they're kind of framing something there.

30:29.460 --> 30:30.460
Right.

30:30.460 --> 30:31.460
I don't know.

30:31.460 --> 30:32.460
Just okay.

30:32.460 --> 30:33.460
I'm going to look stupid.

30:33.460 --> 30:34.460
Cause y'all know something I don't yet.

30:34.460 --> 30:35.460
So we're playing time warp here.

30:35.460 --> 30:36.460
So we'll see.

30:36.460 --> 30:37.460
All right.

30:37.460 --> 30:38.460
Um, and this is kind of cool.

30:38.460 --> 30:43.660
Uh, since I was just talking about Minecraft, you may remember back in 2013 that there was

30:43.660 --> 30:49.140
a mass effect data pack for Minecraft that was released, which allowed you to play as

30:49.140 --> 30:55.880
the skins of the characters from a mass effect, as well as, um, they had some of the, uh,

30:55.880 --> 30:57.820
worlds and stuff from that as well.

30:57.820 --> 30:59.020
I didn't know they got rid of it.

30:59.020 --> 31:03.380
Well, yeah, it hasn't been compatible with the newer versions of Minecraft until just

31:03.380 --> 31:04.380
now.

31:04.380 --> 31:08.660
So you can actually play it on X-Box one PlayStation four, switch PC and mobile.

31:08.660 --> 31:09.660
Got it.

31:09.660 --> 31:10.660
Okay.

31:10.660 --> 31:12.860
I just assumed, I guess maybe I didn't understand enough about how Minecraft worked.

31:12.860 --> 31:16.160
I just assumed, Oh, you could only get it on the three 60 and whatever they don't sell

31:16.160 --> 31:17.160
it on the other ones.

31:17.160 --> 31:18.420
I didn't realize it was a compatibility.

31:18.420 --> 31:19.420
Well, that's cool.

31:19.420 --> 31:22.620
Have you ever seen the, um, because I know you're a big mass effect stand like me.

31:22.620 --> 31:26.680
Have you ever seen like the Minecrafts or the mass effect skin for Minecraft?

31:26.680 --> 31:31.860
Have I played Minecraft any, and in at least a year, it's super cute though, which I haven't

31:31.860 --> 31:32.860
seen it.

31:32.860 --> 31:37.160
Um, speaking of playing things in a year, uh, I'll give you guys an Allen update.

31:37.160 --> 31:41.700
Allen is playing the mass effect trilogy from the start once again, because he said it's

31:41.700 --> 31:43.560
been years and I want to play it again.

31:43.560 --> 31:45.380
So that is his current like game of the moment.

31:45.380 --> 31:47.540
I like how he thinks he's still on mass effect one.

31:47.540 --> 31:51.020
It's been a couple of weeks, but that's, that's, that's very much because I know what he's

31:51.020 --> 31:52.020
doing.

31:52.020 --> 31:53.500
He's playing every single mission in the game.

31:53.500 --> 31:55.180
That's what I always do.

31:55.180 --> 31:56.180
Yep.

31:56.180 --> 32:01.460
So anyway, um, and then speaking of Minecraft some more, and then we'll also talk about

32:01.460 --> 32:06.820
it a little bit, Metroid fusion, somebody for some reason spent seven years of their

32:06.820 --> 32:15.140
time programming Metroid fusion into Minecraft, actually recreating the game using tire game

32:15.140 --> 32:16.140
or like just that.

32:16.140 --> 32:22.460
Um, that's, I don't know if it's completely done yet, but, uh, basically he's got it.

32:22.460 --> 32:27.460
It's all with command blocks and just, it's ridiculous.

32:27.460 --> 32:28.820
Like the sprites and everything.

32:28.820 --> 32:34.540
Now I would have thought this is made in dreams on PlayStation four or something like that.

32:34.540 --> 32:35.540
Nope.

32:35.540 --> 32:42.900
But yeah, they've got like, um, some images like that he shared back like years ago, but

32:42.900 --> 32:44.900
it's just ridiculous.

32:44.900 --> 32:48.820
But he's saying he's going to continue working on it until Nintendo shuts him down.

32:48.820 --> 32:49.820
But he says he's fine.

32:49.820 --> 32:51.940
He's a hundred percent fine with that, which will be tomorrow.

32:51.940 --> 32:55.140
Well, it's been going on for seven years.

32:55.140 --> 32:59.220
Is it something that can be put in Minecraft on the switch?

32:59.220 --> 33:04.460
I don't know if that would be able to run to like, cause the, all the console versions

33:04.460 --> 33:07.260
are kind of limited on how much space you have and all that.

33:07.260 --> 33:08.260
Right.

33:08.260 --> 33:09.260
Yeah.

33:09.260 --> 33:10.260
It was pretty hard.

33:10.260 --> 33:11.260
Um, but yeah, that's pretty crazy.

33:11.260 --> 33:13.520
That'd be kind of funny if he put it on the switch and it's like, just try and shut me

33:13.520 --> 33:14.520
down now.

33:14.520 --> 33:16.520
This is funny.

33:16.520 --> 33:17.740
Hackers can put it on the switch.

33:17.740 --> 33:18.740
True.

33:18.740 --> 33:19.740
True.

33:19.740 --> 33:23.100
Um, and then we got it since we are just about the approach March, we've got our games of

33:23.100 --> 33:24.780
gold and PlayStation.

33:24.780 --> 33:26.060
You mean we're in March?

33:26.060 --> 33:27.060
It's March 1st.

33:27.060 --> 33:28.060
March 1st.

33:28.060 --> 33:29.060
Today.

33:29.060 --> 33:30.060
Right.

33:30.060 --> 33:31.060
Check your calendar, Loki.

33:31.060 --> 33:32.340
But these games haven't released yet, so that's fine.

33:32.340 --> 33:37.260
Um, so on the Xbox side of things, we have Batman and the enemy within the complete season.

33:37.260 --> 33:40.380
Um, and then we have Shantae half genie hero.

33:40.380 --> 33:42.220
Those are the Xbox one games.

33:42.220 --> 33:47.660
And then on Xbox three 60 Castlevania, Lord of shadows two and Sonic generations.

33:47.660 --> 33:50.620
I'm sorry, but Lords of shadow one was bad enough.

33:50.620 --> 33:52.660
Why did they have to give us two?

33:52.660 --> 33:54.580
Because Konami has got to make some money.

33:54.580 --> 34:01.940
And then, um, on the PlayStation side, we've got, uh, Sonic forces and shadow of the Colossus.

34:01.940 --> 34:02.940
Okay.

34:02.940 --> 34:03.940
Neat.

34:03.940 --> 34:04.940
So not bad.

34:04.940 --> 34:11.420
And then, uh, last but not least, uh, good old games has changed their refund policy.

34:11.420 --> 34:20.060
So now if you play or purchase a game, you have 30 days after you purchase to, um, you

34:20.060 --> 34:22.460
know, file for a refund.

34:22.460 --> 34:26.740
However, there are, you know, and they're basically, they're saying that we trust that

34:26.740 --> 34:31.620
you're making an informed purchase decisions and we'll use this updated voluntary refund

34:31.620 --> 34:32.620
policy.

34:32.620 --> 34:37.060
Only if something doesn't work for you as expected while there's a, this is why there

34:37.060 --> 34:40.580
are no limits, but instead we reserve the right for refuse refunds.

34:40.580 --> 34:47.540
In individual cases, please respect all the time and hard work, uh, put into making game

34:47.540 --> 34:49.220
or making the games that you play.

34:49.220 --> 34:51.900
And remember the refunds are not reviews.

34:51.900 --> 34:55.780
If you finish the game and didn't like it, please consider sharing your opinion and said

34:55.780 --> 35:00.380
also please don't take advantage of our trust by asking for an unreasonable amount of games

35:00.380 --> 35:01.820
to be refunded.

35:01.820 --> 35:03.360
Don't be that person.

35:03.360 --> 35:06.380
No one likes that person.

35:06.380 --> 35:11.740
So I like that, um, that comment there at the end, but yeah, I do feel like this might

35:11.740 --> 35:17.060
open them up for some problems, but I mean, I'm just, I'm pretty sure that they're aware

35:17.060 --> 35:22.700
of how people can be because there are those people out there that will do this, but you

35:22.700 --> 35:27.020
know, I like that it's kind of open to, you know, don't be a dick because we'll know that

35:27.020 --> 35:32.460
you're being a deck and we're not going to give you your refund.

35:32.460 --> 35:37.060
That's very, that really opens it up though for like people to buy a game, beat the game,

35:37.060 --> 35:39.860
refund the game, like using this as a rental system.

35:39.860 --> 35:43.380
They can look at it and see them kind of seeing that that's what you're doing.

35:43.380 --> 35:44.380
Okay.

35:44.380 --> 35:45.380
Yeah.

35:45.380 --> 35:46.380
All right.

35:46.700 --> 35:49.740
So I suppose I'd be very curious what the statistics look like a little bit after this.

35:49.740 --> 35:54.040
I mean, sometimes when you kind of trust, like, you know, there's a lot of games out

35:54.040 --> 36:00.300
there that just don't have any DRM at all and they still sell pretty darn well, even

36:00.300 --> 36:01.300
with piracy.

36:01.300 --> 36:02.300
I don't think these games have DRM.

36:02.300 --> 36:03.300
I don't think they do either.

36:03.300 --> 36:06.420
So, but that's kind of a, if you think about it though, that still kind of sucks though

36:06.420 --> 36:11.260
for the individual, because I'm assuming that GOG isn't taking a hit on this stuff.

36:11.260 --> 36:14.860
So that kind of sucks for the indie developers that put out some of these games on the service

36:14.860 --> 36:19.580
and then 30 days later, you know, they may be getting money taken away from them.

36:19.580 --> 36:20.580
Depends on the abuse.

36:20.580 --> 36:23.580
It depends what maybe GOG's promised them about how they're going to enforce it.

36:23.580 --> 36:28.500
Like, you know, if a person does this X many of times, an X window, we're going to review

36:28.500 --> 36:33.540
the play time and maybe, you know, not allow them to use the system anymore.

36:33.540 --> 36:34.540
So we'll see.

36:34.540 --> 36:37.760
Or GOG has achievements, right?

36:37.760 --> 36:40.740
So that's what the achievements can come back to bite you because you will look at the achievements

36:40.740 --> 36:42.460
to see the person beat the game and then refunded it.

36:42.460 --> 36:45.580
And it's like, okay, come on, what are you doing?

36:45.580 --> 36:48.140
So it's going to be an interesting way to monitor the accounts.

36:48.140 --> 36:49.140
I don't know.

36:49.140 --> 36:50.140
All right.

36:50.140 --> 36:51.140
All right.

36:51.140 --> 36:54.780
Well, if that's it from you, let's let's check in with Dark Soccer and see what stories she

36:54.780 --> 36:55.780
wants to talk about tonight.

36:55.780 --> 36:57.260
There's always shenanigans, you know.

36:57.260 --> 36:58.260
There is.

36:58.260 --> 37:02.220
Well, Harmonics has unveiled a new game.

37:02.220 --> 37:05.700
It's called Fuser, where it is a mixing game.

37:05.700 --> 37:11.460
You play as a DJ at a festival, as long as it's not Coachella because the owner is a

37:11.460 --> 37:14.020
bad person.

37:14.020 --> 37:19.140
So it looks like they're going to have over one hundred songs that you can mix in real

37:19.140 --> 37:20.140
time.

37:20.140 --> 37:26.060
So you grab vocals from one and the guitar from another mashup simulator.

37:26.060 --> 37:32.500
Pretty much it's it's literally drop mix like Harmonics already did this game, except there's

37:32.500 --> 37:34.180
a twist.

37:34.180 --> 37:35.520
Drop mix is a board game.

37:35.520 --> 37:37.540
It's a tangible thing with real cards.

37:37.540 --> 37:40.100
This is going to sell better.

37:40.100 --> 37:41.220
This is going to sell better.

37:41.220 --> 37:43.260
And it's Magic the Gathering online, basically.

37:43.260 --> 37:44.260
Right.

37:44.260 --> 37:45.260
Yeah.

37:45.260 --> 37:50.620
But basically, yeah, it's like you're going to be managing from from you have four different

37:50.620 --> 37:58.700
decks and you have a few restrictions on what you can do.

37:58.700 --> 38:00.620
But it has to be the four.

38:00.620 --> 38:07.060
So it's going to be on Switch, PS4, PC and the Xbone.

38:07.060 --> 38:09.220
So we'll see what it comes out like.

38:09.340 --> 38:10.340
It looks like it could be fun.

38:10.340 --> 38:15.380
Yeah, I mean, I love drop mix like it's cool, but I understand like the game itself for

38:15.380 --> 38:19.700
drop mix is kind of like it's like it's it's one of those games.

38:19.700 --> 38:20.700
Do you remember?

38:20.700 --> 38:23.780
Do you remember the board game Mouse Trap that never worked?

38:23.780 --> 38:24.780
Yeah.

38:24.780 --> 38:28.340
Well, it was also more fun to just set up the trap or try to put the trap in different

38:28.340 --> 38:33.620
ways or, you know, try to see what other weird things you can do with the parts than it was

38:33.620 --> 38:36.080
to actually play mouse trap.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.500
And I think that's the kind of thing that happens with drop mix.

38:38.500 --> 38:41.620
Like it's more fun to just sit there and play with the cards and make your own mixes

38:41.620 --> 38:46.460
than it is like actually played drop mix music going back to the 70s on here.

38:46.460 --> 38:48.860
I mean, oh, the song list is great.

38:48.860 --> 38:49.860
Yeah.

38:49.860 --> 38:56.580
I mean, though, we've got Blue Oyster Cult, The Clash, some Gaga, some Lizzo, of course.

38:56.580 --> 38:57.580
Yes.

38:57.580 --> 39:01.340
Gaga, you know, through the 90s, the aughts through all of it.

39:01.340 --> 39:04.500
So it looks like it could be pretty interesting.

39:04.500 --> 39:05.500
I mean, hello.

39:05.500 --> 39:06.740
Y'all know I love music games.

39:06.740 --> 39:07.740
I'll buy it.

39:07.740 --> 39:08.740
Of course.

39:08.740 --> 39:09.740
Exactly.

39:09.740 --> 39:10.740
Yeah.

39:10.740 --> 39:11.740
Yeah.

39:11.740 --> 39:14.780
So, um, that's the wrong link.

39:14.780 --> 39:17.060
I was helping somebody find beard sanitizer.

39:17.060 --> 39:24.580
Oh, I was like, no, it's an immunocompromised friend who has worries about the now airborne

39:24.580 --> 39:30.060
COVID, the now local and airborne.

39:30.060 --> 39:32.060
I thought there was only one case here locally.

39:32.060 --> 39:33.060
Yeah, I know.

39:33.060 --> 39:35.020
It's some big deal.

39:35.020 --> 39:37.100
I'm not worried.

39:37.100 --> 39:38.340
I'm not bothered.

39:38.340 --> 39:43.740
I'm about to go on a cruise and hopefully, um, it doesn't take me a month to get back.

39:43.740 --> 39:44.740
Who knows?

39:44.740 --> 39:46.180
This might be the last OLR for six minutes.

39:46.180 --> 39:47.180
So many announcements.

39:47.180 --> 39:49.980
They're like, oh my God, open the floodgates now.

39:49.980 --> 39:56.120
I just hope it's not like it was a few years ago when I had swine flu and didn't know it.

39:56.120 --> 40:00.580
If there's any, if there's any, if, if I do end up trapped on a boat due to COVID, at

40:00.580 --> 40:04.580
least I'll be trapped on a boat with Wilson Cruz and Kate Mulgrew.

40:04.580 --> 40:08.900
So it's like, you know, I will, I will play with your cat.

40:08.900 --> 40:09.900
Okay.

40:09.900 --> 40:10.900
Thank you.

40:10.900 --> 40:12.540
I already told Dan I was going to come over to entertain the smush.

40:12.540 --> 40:13.540
Oh God, that's right.

40:13.540 --> 40:14.540
Oh my God.

40:14.540 --> 40:15.740
How would we take care of the cat?

40:15.740 --> 40:18.980
You would honestly like, I'll just, you would have to just take some motion to your own

40:18.980 --> 40:19.980
home.

40:19.980 --> 40:22.340
He and Midna would fight over the food bowl.

40:22.340 --> 40:23.340
Well, it's just, yeah.

40:23.340 --> 40:24.700
And why are we even entertaining this?

40:24.700 --> 40:25.700
It's not going to happen.

40:25.700 --> 40:28.700
Why are we even entertaining this?

40:28.700 --> 40:32.420
Anyways, streets of rage four.

40:32.420 --> 40:35.580
We like to fantasize about all the bad things that can happen to us.

40:35.580 --> 40:42.380
Well, just drew posted on Facebook a little bit ago, the, the quote from a welcome to

40:42.380 --> 40:43.380
Night Vale.

40:43.380 --> 40:45.900
May all of your dreams come true.

40:45.900 --> 40:46.900
All of them.

40:46.900 --> 40:50.620
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

40:50.620 --> 40:52.700
Anyway, streets of rage four.

40:52.700 --> 40:55.940
It's getting some new stuff.

40:55.940 --> 41:01.180
When it launches, there is going to be two person online co-op.

41:01.180 --> 41:02.980
Yay.

41:02.980 --> 41:08.660
And up to four player offline co-op, yay.

41:08.660 --> 41:13.980
And there's going to be a new playable characters.

41:13.980 --> 41:21.100
One of them is Floyd, who is cybernetic.

41:21.100 --> 41:27.340
He actually was upgraded due to Dr. Zan from streets of rage three.

41:27.340 --> 41:30.100
He's slow, but strong.

41:30.100 --> 41:38.220
So yeah, streets of rage four, hopefully, hopefully it's going to be awesome.

41:38.220 --> 41:39.540
Well, Yuzuru Koshiro is doing the music.

41:39.540 --> 41:40.540
That's all I need.

41:40.540 --> 41:41.540
Okay.

41:41.540 --> 41:42.540
That's all I care about then.

41:42.540 --> 41:44.980
And there better be bare knuckle arcade machines in it.

41:44.980 --> 41:46.980
We'll see.

41:46.980 --> 41:50.780
So little bit more.

41:50.780 --> 41:57.940
Dragon Ball Fighter, Dragon Ball Fighter's season three has gone live with a bunch of

41:57.940 --> 41:59.380
different changes.

41:59.380 --> 42:05.180
You get something called Z assist that gives you assist attacks for every member of the

42:05.180 --> 42:08.740
roster, kind of like how it worked for Marvel versus Capcom.

42:08.740 --> 42:13.940
And it lets you create even crazier combos in the game.

42:13.940 --> 42:19.820
You would be able to choose your partner for like juggling or projectile or a little bit

42:19.820 --> 42:20.820
more on that.

42:20.820 --> 42:24.300
So it'll be, it'll be pretty neat.

42:24.300 --> 42:29.020
Few other things is that you will have a limit break.

42:29.020 --> 42:30.020
Thanks Final Fantasy seven.

42:30.020 --> 42:32.180
I was like, what is this Final Fantasy?

42:32.180 --> 42:33.180
Right.

42:33.180 --> 42:38.460
But basically when the player is down to their last fighter, they will get a slight damage

42:38.460 --> 42:44.340
boost and a free bar of meter allowing, which would basically make them do like a last stand

42:44.340 --> 42:45.340
attack.

42:45.340 --> 42:48.500
That's kind of similar to Mortal Kombat 11's fatal blows.

42:48.500 --> 42:51.980
So it's really just a combat mechanic.

42:51.980 --> 42:53.360
And then some new characters.

42:53.360 --> 42:57.380
So Kefla will be in there.

42:57.380 --> 43:04.060
And then there will also be ultra instinct Goku.

43:04.060 --> 43:09.980
All the Goku will be in the game, but I don't know.

43:09.980 --> 43:13.320
I mean this character, she kind of annoyed me in the series.

43:13.320 --> 43:17.580
So I mean she was cool, but annoying in the series.

43:17.580 --> 43:20.900
So yeah, some, some cool stuff.

43:20.900 --> 43:22.780
Played the Dragon Ballses.

43:22.780 --> 43:28.900
I still have yet to unfortunately play this game, but at some point I'll play it eventually.

43:28.900 --> 43:30.260
I reckon.

43:30.260 --> 43:33.100
You know, I'm looking at this next story that I'm going to talk about.

43:33.100 --> 43:37.220
And there's a, it's, this is one of those cases of advertising working because I'm presented

43:37.220 --> 43:41.780
with a giant ad for the Double Dragon and Kunio-kun retro brawler bundle, which is kind

43:41.780 --> 43:44.640
of neat, which I remember discussing on a previous show.

43:44.640 --> 43:48.920
What I forgot was that, oh, it's like coming out like now, or in this case it's already

43:48.920 --> 43:49.920
out.

43:49.920 --> 43:50.920
I forgot.

43:50.920 --> 43:51.920
So you've played it.

43:51.920 --> 43:52.920
You and Dan have played it?

43:52.920 --> 43:53.920
Our friend has it.

43:53.920 --> 43:55.560
He brought over a Switch and we enjoyed some of it.

43:55.560 --> 43:56.560
It was pretty fun.

43:56.560 --> 43:57.560
Is it neat?

43:57.560 --> 43:58.560
Yeah.

43:58.560 --> 43:59.560
I can't wait to play some of this.

43:59.560 --> 44:00.560
It's old school.

44:00.560 --> 44:01.560
Yeah.

44:01.560 --> 44:02.560
It's the classics.

44:02.560 --> 44:04.400
And I'm excited that we have like new games in English basically.

44:04.400 --> 44:05.400
This is a trend.

44:05.400 --> 44:08.160
And it's the old school, like legit Niketsu games.

44:08.160 --> 44:09.160
Yeah.

44:09.160 --> 44:14.260
This is this random trend I'm loving all of a sudden is like all of these old ass retro

44:14.260 --> 44:18.180
games are suddenly getting localized for mother three.

44:18.180 --> 44:19.180
Fuck you.

44:19.180 --> 44:24.820
Well, to be fair, mother three already was localized for Europe, but yeah, anyway, I

44:24.820 --> 44:25.820
know.

44:25.820 --> 44:26.820
Oh, I guess.

44:26.820 --> 44:27.820
Yeah.

44:27.820 --> 44:28.820
We continue to get screwed when it comes to mother three.

44:28.820 --> 44:31.900
But, uh, well I was thinking trials of manna of course was the thing on my brain.

44:31.900 --> 44:32.900
So there's that.

44:32.900 --> 44:33.900
So, all right.

44:33.900 --> 44:37.860
Uh, anyway, the story I was actually going to read before I got distracted by a giant

44:37.860 --> 44:38.860
advertisement.

44:38.860 --> 44:46.940
Um, was talking a little bit about, um, the, um, no, Alan just got home.

44:46.940 --> 44:47.940
That's not the cat.

44:47.940 --> 44:48.940
He liked it.

44:48.940 --> 44:49.940
The cat get out.

44:49.940 --> 44:50.940
Well, cause it didn't shut the door all the way.

44:50.940 --> 44:51.940
No, you're fine.

44:51.940 --> 44:52.940
You're fine.

44:52.940 --> 44:53.940
Alan is probably opening a window.

44:53.940 --> 44:54.940
Um, it is.

44:54.940 --> 44:55.940
It is a little hot in here.

44:55.940 --> 45:00.580
Um, it's just me anyway.

45:00.580 --> 45:04.140
The story, the 2020 PlayStation player celebration.

45:04.140 --> 45:05.140
That's right.

45:05.140 --> 45:08.380
Uh, you have a chance to play more games and earn more trophies this year.

45:08.380 --> 45:10.340
It's the PlayStation player celebration.

45:10.340 --> 45:15.180
If the community hits some different milestones, such as half a million trophies, uh, you get

45:15.180 --> 45:23.580
exclusive PS4 themes and avatars and, and one of the big prizes, a real life platinum

45:23.580 --> 45:24.980
trophy.

45:24.980 --> 45:25.980
That's right.

45:25.980 --> 45:30.260
You can have a platinum trophy IRL and you can show all your friends just how big your

45:30.260 --> 45:33.140
E-penis is with your, uh, put that on your Tinder profile.

45:33.140 --> 45:34.140
That's right.

45:34.140 --> 45:35.140
Put that on your Tinder profile.

45:35.140 --> 45:36.140
Anyway.

45:36.140 --> 45:37.620
Um, this just got underway.

45:37.860 --> 45:42.900
I think February 24th was in the first community goals started, uh, which was a 125,000 games

45:42.900 --> 45:45.460
played and 500,000 trophies earned.

45:45.460 --> 45:49.180
There will be an exclusive static PS4 theme.

45:49.180 --> 45:53.540
And I imagine that, um, people were probably going to unlock all these things anyway.

45:53.540 --> 45:57.700
I just, I just don't see how the community doesn't actually unlock all these things.

45:57.700 --> 46:00.300
So cause they put pretty achievable goals in there.

46:00.300 --> 46:01.300
Yeah.

46:01.300 --> 46:05.780
They probably know like the averages and they probably bumped it up slightly, but not too

46:05.780 --> 46:06.780
much.

46:06.940 --> 46:09.660
So it's, it's, I'm sure it'll, it'll be effective.

46:09.660 --> 46:14.820
So, um, and then the only other things I really wanted to talk about, oops, I just randomly

46:14.820 --> 46:18.580
closed the story, but I remember that, uh, there's some changes with Overwatch.

46:18.580 --> 46:24.060
Uh, one of them is that the, uh, Overwatch league matches, some of them are getting canceled

46:24.060 --> 46:28.340
due to COVID, um, which is kind of not new news right now.

46:28.340 --> 46:29.340
Right.

46:29.340 --> 46:32.400
We've hearing a lot of different things are getting canceled or people backing out or

46:32.400 --> 46:33.400
so forth.

46:33.400 --> 46:35.780
It will be interesting to see how PAX East went.

46:35.780 --> 46:37.980
Um, I'm not, I'm not worried about COVID.

46:37.980 --> 46:42.740
I'm just thinking about like how that goes with a lot of the folks that have dropped

46:42.740 --> 46:45.820
out, you know, but you know, having been to PAX and we've all been to PAX.

46:45.820 --> 46:48.540
I mean, we went to PAX prime one year, all of us together.

46:48.540 --> 46:49.540
That was a fun year.

46:49.540 --> 46:54.740
Um, but you know, there's a lot of like board games going on 24 seven and land and you know,

46:54.740 --> 46:56.220
people just celebrating gaming.

46:56.220 --> 46:59.940
So I feel like there's, it's not like there's going to be a shortage of things to do.

46:59.940 --> 47:03.780
It's just that, you know, the expo hall is going to be a little, little less exciting,

47:03.780 --> 47:04.780
but they've still got Indies.

47:04.780 --> 47:06.020
They got plenty of stuff to see.

47:06.020 --> 47:13.700
So anyway, um, but the Overwatch league, South Korean matches are being canceled due to the,

47:13.700 --> 47:19.020
um, novel coronavirus worries or COVID, um, because, uh, unfortunately the more and more

47:19.020 --> 47:22.980
and more and more cases are showing up in South Korea, just like we're hearing in Italy.

47:22.980 --> 47:27.080
Uh, and, um, what was it Iran, I think is the other big one since we last did a show.

47:27.080 --> 47:30.220
So fortunately it's, unfortunately it's spreading.

47:30.220 --> 47:33.540
Um, so some more events are being affected because of it.

47:33.540 --> 47:37.700
But something that will definitely affect everyone in Overwatch is a new experimental

47:37.700 --> 47:38.700
mode.

47:38.700 --> 47:41.900
So you may or may not know, depending on how much you play Overwatch, they changed the

47:41.900 --> 47:47.380
queuing system sometimes ago to be two tanks, two healers and two DPS.

47:47.380 --> 47:50.580
So that way you kind of queue for matches in a certain role.

47:50.580 --> 47:57.700
Well, uh, Overwatch is now testing a new mode where you can actually do three DPS and one

47:57.700 --> 47:59.380
tank and two healers.

47:59.380 --> 48:02.460
Uh, so they call it triple DPS or something like that, triple damage.

48:02.460 --> 48:03.460
That's it.

48:03.460 --> 48:05.360
And they're calling it an experimental mode.

48:05.360 --> 48:08.740
So it's, it's not like they didn't replace the two, two, two system with this as a side

48:08.740 --> 48:09.740
thing.

48:09.740 --> 48:13.340
Um, but it's supposed to help improve queue times because everybody wants to be DPS.

48:13.340 --> 48:15.600
Everybody wants to play Hanzo for some reason.

48:15.600 --> 48:18.020
So this is supposed to help those queue times.

48:18.020 --> 48:23.640
So and the feedback on this will make Blizzard decide if they want to implement this into

48:23.640 --> 48:24.640
standard play.

48:24.640 --> 48:29.660
Uh, a quote from, um, Jeff Kaplan, who is the lead designer, the experimental card is

48:29.660 --> 48:33.820
really focused on radical gameplay changes or things that we want to try out to get your

48:33.820 --> 48:35.660
direct player feedback on.

48:35.660 --> 48:37.540
We are unsure of these.

48:37.540 --> 48:39.980
Um, so we'll see how that goes.

48:39.980 --> 48:44.000
Most people I've seen on Twitter seem to be enjoying it so far though, and it makes sense.

48:44.000 --> 48:48.980
So it's just changing one tank to a DPS and more people want to queue as DPS anyway.

48:48.980 --> 48:49.980
So it makes sense.

48:49.980 --> 48:50.980
Yeah.

48:50.980 --> 48:51.980
So we'll see where that goes.

48:51.980 --> 48:55.420
Anyway, that is it for the stories that we were going to cover tonight.

48:55.420 --> 48:58.940
So we're going to go into the listener round table since we're not live tonight, we can't

48:58.940 --> 49:03.340
take your, um, phone calls on discord, but we can talk about some of the stories that

49:03.340 --> 49:04.620
you guys have been posting on discord.

49:04.620 --> 49:08.900
Um, you guys have been posting a lot of stories and I think we already touched on some of

49:08.900 --> 49:09.900
them.

49:09.900 --> 49:12.820
Like I know the Konami code one came up and some other things, but I thought this one

49:12.820 --> 49:13.820
was really cute.

49:13.820 --> 49:18.380
So we got linked to a story that talks about Nintendo's customer support going above and

49:18.380 --> 49:21.580
beyond, uh, for an older lady.

49:21.580 --> 49:25.260
Um, and, uh, this was reported in a local newspaper.

49:25.260 --> 49:31.020
Um, I think it was picked up off of Twitter, but basically long story short, um, this gal's

49:31.020 --> 49:34.260
mom always played her Game Boy.

49:34.260 --> 49:40.700
Um, and when she reached the age of 85, 95, her Game Boy stopped working, but they wanted

49:40.700 --> 49:44.020
her to be able to be happy and still play Tetris on Game Boy and stuff.

49:44.020 --> 49:47.740
So they called Nintendo to try to fix the Game Boy, but of course the Game Boy, they're

49:47.740 --> 49:49.580
no longer supported, right?

49:49.580 --> 49:52.260
Well, Nintendo's support went above and beyond.

49:52.260 --> 49:58.060
And what happened, they, they found a, um, I guess they got within a week of response

49:58.060 --> 50:03.460
saying they didn't have the parts, but they found a brand new Game Boy in a warehouse

50:03.460 --> 50:06.580
of like, you know, this actually is a very common thing.

50:06.580 --> 50:13.020
I'm thinking like the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark that, well, companies do keep surplus

50:13.020 --> 50:14.660
stock on hand.

50:14.660 --> 50:20.180
Case in point, go back to those cases of why Atari had a landfill at one point, because

50:20.180 --> 50:23.260
there was so much surplus stock because everything got sent back.

50:23.260 --> 50:25.060
They literally had no place to put it.

50:25.060 --> 50:30.440
But it's not super uncommon for companies to hold on to surplus stock of certain things.

50:30.440 --> 50:32.740
Four cases kind of like this, actually.

50:32.740 --> 50:37.380
Like I know my high school, I know this because I was on the yearbook committee in high school,

50:37.380 --> 50:41.340
there's a, there was a shed out back that was a storage shed and what they had, they

50:41.340 --> 50:47.420
had one box of every yearbook they've ever printed over the years.

50:47.420 --> 50:50.060
So when I was, there was like 30 years worth of yearbooks and there's probably another

50:50.060 --> 50:51.700
30 years worth of yearbooks there now.

50:51.700 --> 50:56.920
And it was specifically for when people would call the school and say, my house burned down

50:56.920 --> 51:01.000
or I lost this in a fire or is there any way I can replace this?

51:01.000 --> 51:05.540
They have one box of books to be able to, so if you've ever lost your yearbook, call

51:05.540 --> 51:09.440
your school, they might have something if that's something of importance to you.

51:09.440 --> 51:11.400
So I thought that was kind of neat.

51:11.400 --> 51:15.540
So I think this is, this is partially that and partially just sometimes you don't know

51:15.540 --> 51:17.380
where else to put this shit.

51:17.380 --> 51:19.700
Like, have you ever looked at your garage?

51:19.700 --> 51:22.420
You probably have a lot of shit out there that you don't really need.

51:22.420 --> 51:26.220
And I think a lot of this happens with Nintendo too.

51:26.220 --> 51:27.460
It wouldn't really surprise me.

51:27.460 --> 51:34.340
I mean, I've bought sealed in box old stuff from work, you know, not going to say where

51:34.340 --> 51:36.660
I work, but I've done it before.

51:36.660 --> 51:37.660
Sure.

51:37.660 --> 51:38.660
Yeah.

51:38.660 --> 51:41.820
So anyway, you know, so I don't think it's quite as novel that they still have one on

51:41.820 --> 51:45.220
hand, but what is novel is the fact that they did, they went the extra mile and sent her

51:45.220 --> 51:49.320
that for free with a letter wishing a nice long life.

51:49.320 --> 51:53.940
And as a nice footnote here, the grandmother lived to be 99.

51:53.940 --> 51:56.420
So went on another four years.

51:56.420 --> 51:59.240
So powered by Game Boy and four AA batteries.

51:59.240 --> 52:00.240
So very nice.

52:00.240 --> 52:01.240
Cool.

52:01.240 --> 52:03.660
I thought that was a very nice story from our discord.

52:03.660 --> 52:08.040
So let me get to some tweets.

52:08.040 --> 52:09.200
Going to some tweets.

52:09.200 --> 52:15.520
I opened up the Twitter earlier this week at OLR and I like four or five times asked

52:15.520 --> 52:16.880
for stories and we got two.

52:16.880 --> 52:17.880
We got two tweets.

52:18.440 --> 52:22.240
So I'm a little bit sad that more people aren't tweeting us, but to be fair, I should probably

52:22.240 --> 52:24.680
be more active on the Twitter if I want more people to engage.

52:24.680 --> 52:26.840
So I will try to get better at that.

52:26.840 --> 52:29.200
In the meantime, we will read these tweets that we got.

52:29.200 --> 52:34.200
So our first tweet tonight from Garth the Wolf, who tweets us, have you guys checked

52:34.200 --> 52:36.800
out Nier Automata yet?

52:36.800 --> 52:40.960
It's legitimately one of the best games I've played and probably my favorite of this past

52:40.960 --> 52:41.960
generation.

52:41.960 --> 52:44.740
It also has a killer soundtrack and story.

52:44.740 --> 52:46.240
Please check it out if you get the chance.

52:46.600 --> 52:48.600
Has anyone played Nier Automata?

52:48.600 --> 52:51.960
It's been on my wish list for a while, but it's been on my list and I haven't got to.

52:51.960 --> 52:52.960
You know what's sad?

52:52.960 --> 52:56.920
I've played the first Nier, a little bit of it, but I still haven't played Nier Automata.

52:56.920 --> 52:59.320
But and I don't know if you know about this.

52:59.320 --> 53:01.980
That's the game where if you eat a fish you'll die.

53:01.980 --> 53:08.100
In Final Fantasy 14, the raids right now, the new 24 man raids are all inspired by because

53:08.100 --> 53:11.640
they're co-created by the guy behind Nier Automata.

53:11.640 --> 53:16.000
So this current raid, the 24 man raid, and I've been running this raid quite a few times.

53:16.760 --> 53:19.040
It's called the Copied Factory and it's inspired by Nier.

53:19.040 --> 53:23.600
So a lot of the monster design, because it doesn't look like Final Fantasy when you're

53:23.600 --> 53:24.600
in there.

53:24.600 --> 53:30.120
It's all big, these gigantic mech robots and things, and the last guy's in a tank and it's

53:30.120 --> 53:31.440
like Transformers and shit.

53:31.440 --> 53:35.040
He transforms into a plane that starts gunning you on the ground and stuff, but it's really

53:35.040 --> 53:36.040
cool.

53:36.040 --> 53:38.440
But the music is some of the best music in the game.

53:38.440 --> 53:45.280
And I don't know if they lifted it from Nier or if they had, who's the guy who does all

53:45.280 --> 53:46.280
the music?

53:46.280 --> 53:48.640
The guy, I can't remember his name in the moment, but the guy who does all the music

53:48.640 --> 53:49.640
in Final Fantasy 14?

53:49.640 --> 53:50.640
Sakurai?

53:50.640 --> 53:51.640
Sakurai, yeah.

53:51.640 --> 53:57.280
I don't know if they had him do all that, but yeah.

53:57.280 --> 53:58.640
I love the music in there.

53:58.640 --> 53:59.640
It's some of the best.

53:59.640 --> 54:00.640
So, all right.

54:00.640 --> 54:03.120
I'll have to put that on the list.

54:03.120 --> 54:09.720
Anyway, let's go to Dark Tetsuya who says, I've been playing Contra Rogue Core and I

54:09.720 --> 54:13.560
have to say it's not nearly as bad as people are saying it is.

54:13.560 --> 54:17.280
Incidentally, on the subject of the Konami code, it does appear in the game, but really

54:17.280 --> 54:21.240
only to obtain one of the game's various medals.

54:21.240 --> 54:22.480
Still a neat nod to it.

54:22.480 --> 54:23.480
Oh, so that's kind of cute.

54:23.480 --> 54:27.040
So you put in the Konami code and it's like, sorry, you don't get shit, but this achievement

54:27.040 --> 54:28.040
is nothing.

54:28.040 --> 54:30.300
Yeah, but I've watched gameplay of that and it looks really terrible.

54:30.300 --> 54:36.480
Like I get it, it's not as terrible as you thought it is, but it's still pretty terrible.

54:36.480 --> 54:37.580
I'm not playing it.

54:37.580 --> 54:43.520
I was really excited for it too, but then I saw the gameplay and I'm like, no, no, there's

54:43.520 --> 54:45.480
no, that's not, that's not Contra.

54:45.480 --> 54:46.480
I'm sorry.

54:46.480 --> 54:47.480
Well, okay.

54:47.480 --> 54:51.360
But has there ever been a game, and I asked this for Dark Soccer or, you know, anyone

54:51.360 --> 54:54.400
out there really, cause I know we still have a chat room going tonight.

54:54.400 --> 55:01.360
Has there been a game where like everybody just shit on the game, but you like the game,

55:01.360 --> 55:02.360
dammit.

55:02.360 --> 55:04.680
Like it's not as bad as everybody says it is.

55:04.680 --> 55:07.760
For me, okay, I'm gonna tell you what game for me that is.

55:07.760 --> 55:13.640
Friday the 13th on the original NES, because I think that game, at least when I was a kid

55:13.640 --> 55:18.000
legit scared the hell out of me and I thought it was a really good soundtrack and I thought

55:18.000 --> 55:19.360
it was really hard.

55:19.360 --> 55:22.880
I remember being a total flop at the game, but then I see all this stuff later about

55:22.880 --> 55:25.160
how like, oh, it's the worst NES game ever made.

55:25.160 --> 55:26.160
No, it's not.

55:26.160 --> 55:27.160
It's not the worst.

55:27.160 --> 55:29.560
There are far worse games on the NES.

55:29.560 --> 55:30.560
So that's like one of mine.

55:30.560 --> 55:36.820
Are there any like games that everybody shit on, but you're like, it's not that bad.

55:36.820 --> 55:37.820
And it's Soken.

55:37.820 --> 55:44.380
I'm like Sakurai is the guy that made Smash Brothers, that's not his name, Soken.

55:44.380 --> 55:49.620
I don't know off the top of my head, I mean, I'm sure I've liked some really bad games

55:49.620 --> 55:56.740
out there, but I can't think of, I liked Abadox for a while, I mean, but that wasn't really

55:56.740 --> 55:57.860
that bad of a game.

55:57.860 --> 56:00.940
I know.

56:00.940 --> 56:04.780
There was a hot minute where my brothers and I were super obsessed with playing the terrible

56:04.780 --> 56:13.700
Home Alone game on SNES and I did enjoy Blastress with the Super Scope, but Blastress was fun.

56:13.700 --> 56:16.780
There's not like too many really bad games.

56:16.780 --> 56:21.020
There was something really novel about the fact that the Super Nintendo, it didn't just

56:21.020 --> 56:24.060
have a light gun, it had a fucking bazooka.

56:24.060 --> 56:29.060
Like talk about one of the most bad ass peripherals that a company has ever put out, like Justice

56:29.060 --> 56:30.060
for the Super Scope.

56:30.060 --> 56:31.060
That thing was awesome.

56:31.060 --> 56:32.060
It's pretty good.

56:32.060 --> 56:33.060
I know.

56:33.060 --> 56:34.060
I miss, I miss the bazooka.

56:34.340 --> 56:35.340
We need that.

56:35.340 --> 56:36.340
We need a bazooka game.

56:36.340 --> 56:39.980
Hey, YYR.

56:39.980 --> 56:41.460
He's not manufacturing peripherals.

56:41.460 --> 56:42.740
No, no, no, we need it.

56:42.740 --> 56:47.580
We need a sharpshooter mode because this, buy sharpshooter on Steam.

56:47.580 --> 56:48.580
There's your plug.

56:48.580 --> 56:49.580
Okay.

56:49.580 --> 56:52.820
But we need a mode that supports a bazooka.

56:52.820 --> 56:53.820
I'm sorry.

56:53.820 --> 56:54.820
He's not supporting that.

56:54.820 --> 56:55.820
No, I know.

56:55.820 --> 56:56.820
He, what?

56:56.820 --> 56:59.060
He, he doesn't just exist to make all of our wishes come true.

56:59.060 --> 57:03.380
You can, you can just have to, you'll have to rig it yourself using some sort of like,

57:03.380 --> 57:08.900
I don't know what sort of jank peripheral would connect the Super Scope to a computer

57:08.900 --> 57:09.900
and then do it that way.

57:09.900 --> 57:10.900
It's gotta be out there.

57:10.900 --> 57:18.340
They do have controller converters, so it wouldn't be too hard.

57:18.340 --> 57:19.340
Yeah.

57:19.340 --> 57:21.660
It's just a matter of being able to read the screen and all that.

57:21.660 --> 57:23.540
Which you probably can't do.

57:23.540 --> 57:24.540
Yeah.

57:24.540 --> 57:25.540
All right.

57:25.540 --> 57:26.540
Yeah.

57:26.540 --> 57:28.020
Because like light guns don't even work on new TVs.

57:28.020 --> 57:33.260
But I'm sure that by some magic and a raspberry pie shoved into a Super Scope, you probably

57:33.260 --> 57:34.260
could make it work.

57:34.260 --> 57:35.260
There we go.

57:35.260 --> 57:36.260
Now we're talking.

57:36.260 --> 57:37.260
Now we're talking.

57:37.260 --> 57:38.260
All right.

57:38.260 --> 57:40.460
Anyhow, uh, that's, that's it for the listener round table for tonight.

57:40.460 --> 57:45.780
You can always tweet us more, uh, at OLR if you want to send us a tweet or excuse me,

57:45.780 --> 57:47.060
you can always send us an email as well.

57:47.060 --> 57:48.060
Cause I don't think we haven't.

57:48.060 --> 57:49.400
I like the excite truck.

57:49.400 --> 57:54.780
That's not necessarily a highly, I don't think anyone hated that game, but I, I really liked

57:54.780 --> 57:55.780
that game.

57:55.780 --> 57:56.780
I did.

57:56.780 --> 57:58.100
You liked it more than most people did.

57:58.100 --> 57:59.100
Yes.

57:59.100 --> 58:03.020
It was an awesome game in which we'll never be a sequel for, you know,

58:03.780 --> 58:06.340
or all there was, but that was absolute garbage.

58:06.340 --> 58:08.680
Like what the hell were you thinking?

58:08.680 --> 58:12.460
Make a sandwich in the middle of the goddamn race, throw a pie at a clown.

58:12.460 --> 58:13.460
What the fuck is that?

58:13.460 --> 58:14.580
That's not a racing game.

58:14.580 --> 58:17.100
The whole fact that they kind of like took excite bike.

58:17.100 --> 58:21.380
I mean, and like it was one of those things, like I didn't even get it until like the game

58:21.380 --> 58:23.380
was already out and I've been playing it for a couple of weeks.

58:23.380 --> 58:27.740
I was like, Oh, excite bike excite truck.

58:27.740 --> 58:32.700
Oh, it's not really at all the same, but it's because they're not, they're not at all.

58:32.700 --> 58:37.020
Aside from like maybe the turbo mechanic was kind of similar, but then that was about where

58:37.020 --> 58:38.020
it ended.

58:38.020 --> 58:45.940
Um, but you know, then excite bots just went off the fucking rails and on the rails too,

58:45.940 --> 58:48.820
because there was rail sliding in that game for God knows what reason.

58:48.820 --> 58:49.820
All right.

58:49.820 --> 58:54.060
Anyway, if you want to email us, participate at orange line trader.com or if you want to

58:54.060 --> 59:00.220
tweet us at O L R let's take a trip down memory lane and visit the classic game of the week.

59:00.220 --> 59:03.940
So every week, dark soccer likes to step into the, into the gaming vault and find a game

59:03.940 --> 59:08.300
that she says, Hey, you should, you should put this in your house and play it.

59:08.300 --> 59:09.300
Good luck.

59:09.300 --> 59:13.900
I mean, you'd have to have a pretty big house for this, uh, for the folks on Twitch.

59:13.900 --> 59:17.780
I do not have video footage of this tonight just because we had to put this show together

59:17.780 --> 59:18.780
very fast.

59:18.780 --> 59:22.180
Um, but this is, this is an interesting pick anyway.

59:22.180 --> 59:23.780
I feel like it's not something that would work.

59:23.780 --> 59:28.100
I think this video half peripheral of the month, we're going back to that.

59:28.100 --> 59:31.420
It's the nausea game for me too, because I used to get really motion sick with this,

59:31.420 --> 59:32.420
but it's Radice.

59:32.420 --> 59:33.420
It's metal as fuck.

59:33.420 --> 59:34.420
Yeah.

59:34.420 --> 59:37.220
Dan, this was like his whole reason for ever wanting to go to Dave and busters.

59:37.220 --> 59:38.220
Yep.

59:38.220 --> 59:41.540
And so Bobby Blackwell is going to perk up cause I know he's a fan of this too.

59:41.540 --> 59:44.620
So I picked a battle tech centers.

59:44.620 --> 59:48.860
It's basically virtual environment venues.

59:48.860 --> 59:57.120
So you have these pods, uh, fully enclosed cockpits that have, uh, multiple screens inside

59:57.160 --> 59:59.520
rudder pedals, joysticks.

59:59.520 --> 01:00:05.640
I would be, I wouldn't be surprised if this was the inspiration for, um, great.

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:11.040
Now I don't remember the English name techa, X-Box mecha game.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:17.440
Um, I remember the, with the $200 accessory, it was like mech warrior mech.

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:18.440
No it wasn't mech warrior.

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:19.920
I know what you're thinking of.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:20.920
It's a steel battalion.

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:21.920
Steel battalion.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:22.920
Thank you.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:28.840
Um, but any, anyway, um, I wouldn't be surprised if this was an inspiration for it.

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:34.880
So at any rate, um, it, it could be found all over, um, you, you actually can still

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:40.320
find them in some places in the U S but the first battle tech center opened in Chicago

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:46.560
in 1990 there was another one in Yokohama in August, 1992 Tokyo, 1993.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:54.000
Um, and eventually 26 facilities opened up that had, you know, more elaborate operations.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.560
The locations were called virtual world.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:59.880
We had one in the middle of like, I don't even remember what it was called, but it was

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:04.240
like some sort of like super bar that was like multiple bars and you had to walk through

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.440
the bar to get to the virtual world thing.

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:10.040
So that was always weird because I heard you like bars.

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:11.040
It was, it was weird.

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:14.060
Like I don't remember what it was called, but it was like, they have like seven bars

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:17.140
all attached to each other and it was the strangest thing.

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:19.220
But virtual world was right in the middle for some reason.

01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:25.560
Well, at any rate, um, it consisted of 16 networked pods, um, that partially designed

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.100
by frog design.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:31.860
Um, and it was highly interactive and really fun.

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:36.940
Um, it actually was even in a discovery channel documentary called beyond 2000.

01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:42.460
Um, you could compete against players and other centers across the country.

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:49.260
Um, they actually had another non battle tech game included called red planet that had,

01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:53.140
it was racing through mining tunnels on, on Mars using hovercrafts.

01:01:53.140 --> 01:02:00.620
Um, but then of course as, um, you know, our, you know, arcade games advanced, you know,

01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:05.980
by 2000 there were no more operational battle tech centers in Japan.

01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:13.940
Um, in 1996 virtual world and, uh, FASA entertainment technologies merged, um, and became a wholly

01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:19.620
owned subsidiaries of virtual world entertainment group and then Microsoft bottom.

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:26.860
So, um, they, uh, wanted to, they actually integrated, um, a lot of that into the Microsoft

01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:28.980
game studio division.

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:34.840
And then all of the interest in virtual worlds entertainment was sold to some other guy and

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:36.400
their offices went to Kalamazoo.

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:38.160
Yeah, it was kind of funny.

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:44.280
Um, but anyway, um, as it literally went to Kalamazoo, it's not just a, no, seriously,

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.720
the office made from Chicago to Kalamazoo.

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:52.920
Um, so there was, um, the virtual world Tesla two cockpits.

01:02:52.920 --> 01:03:00.440
Um, they opened, um, in November, 2005 with eight Tesla two, uh, uh, pods and then they

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.080
added another four.

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:06.280
And so now they do the, uh, battle tech invitational with 12 pods.

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.800
I mean, it's kind of evolved since then.

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:16.560
And sometimes, um, like there is a company called mech jock LLC, uh, we fit the existed

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:22.840
Tesla two pods so that they could bring those battle tech centers to a different, uh, conventions.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:24.960
So they brought it to gen con 2007.

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:30.960
Uh, it's been brought to, uh, comic Palooza, Oni Con, mecha con and dragon con.

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:31.960
Do you've seen it at dragon?

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:35.920
It is there every year at dragon con, but it's one of those staples.

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:40.280
Like if it ever disappeared, like even though I've never done it in all the years that I've

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:42.900
always walked by and go, Oh cool, I remember those.

01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:45.080
And there's always a group that's there playing it.

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:47.580
But, um, and all the years I've been to dragon con, I've never done it.

01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:51.720
But like, if it left, I would be like, how could they get rid of that?

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:53.880
Like, you know, you know how that is, right?

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:54.880
Oh yeah.

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:59.840
Oh, other cons that, um, it's, uh, is going to be at or has been at, there'll also be

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:07.320
gen con origins, ASIN and Yomakon, um, in 2006, some players in Japan bought four Tesla

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:11.720
pods from the U S and put together a virtual world center in Tokyo.

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.560
Um, what year was that again?

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:15.560
Uh, 2006.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:16.560
Oh.

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:22.680
And, um, but the pods are semi operational, even though they had no way to, uh, really

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:23.680
repair them.

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.120
They can't get the parts for them anymore.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:30.240
Um, June, 2012, Mr. Biggs family center closed and their assets were auctioned off, including

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:32.080
their 12 pods.

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:38.520
Um, and, uh, now someone owns 12 pods.

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:45.200
So he removed, he removed his assets and put them into storage.

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:52.520
Um, 2011, along with a, uh, along with a pallet of unopened game boys in 2007, the airlock

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:58.280
in Kirkland, Washington, um, close with eight Tesla simulators transferred and the Washington

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:05.580
secretary of state, um, uh, yeah, there's like a show called better than life says that

01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:06.580
it's inactive.

01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:09.320
Some of this doesn't make sense as how it's put on here.

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:15.120
Um, there were eight pods in 2011 that were listed on Facebook, um, for, uh, at two private

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.120
home arcades.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:23.720
Um, 2017 virtual world entertainment read, launch its website at mech jock.com, um, stating

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:29.400
that they're developing cockpits again and have updated software featuring 5.07 D to

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.840
be played in Houston, grand Rapids and Minneapolis.

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:39.220
Yeah, those are pretty dated by 2018, a battle tech center and game store, big kids in grand

01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:42.920
Rapids, Michigan, permanently closed pod tracker list.

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:47.560
These pods as being private and in control of the owner of the store.

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:54.480
So of the remaining ones, we have the fallout shelter arcade in twin cities, Minnesota met

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:59.720
core entertainment LLC in Houston, Texas and hanger 51 in Montreal.

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:07.920
So fallout has 12 met core has 18 and hanger has 10 and so, um, the last one I saw was

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:17.720
our Dave and busters in, um, Milpitas at the mall cause we would do my birthday every

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:18.720
year.

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:19.720
There'd be that.

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:22.000
And there'd be Derby owners club and then I would be really drunk and go, ah, Derby

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.040
owners club club is still, it's still there.

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:28.080
I think it's, Oh my God, it's been a while.

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:29.080
It's been a while.

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:30.720
Where are those all go?

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:33.480
Like seriously, like they're where all the horses go.

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:36.840
Oh no, there's one in San Francisco.

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:43.120
Um, cause when I went with JD to Dave and busters out further past, like closer to diamond,

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.120
where was it?

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:45.560
Diamond heights out that way further out.

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:46.560
Okay.

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:47.560
Yeah.

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:50.240
But anyway, um, but we played over there.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:53.780
Um, I mean it was occupied and I didn't have my horses.

01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:55.560
I do still have my horses.

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.560
Do you still have politics?

01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:58.560
Oh God.

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:06.680
No, I, they, I threw them in the garbage, like the game in the, I still have Panda half.

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:10.640
I will say, because I know Bobby Black Wolf is probably shouting, he's probably shouting

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:15.200
in chat right now that he wants had an interview all about this game and what it's become with

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:18.640
the, you know, all these years later with the dragon con pods and all that.

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:22.800
So, um, I, I don't know what episode number off the top of my head, but I'm sure he will,

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:25.480
he will provide a link, but it was, it was a good interview and it's, if you want to

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.680
know more about this game and how it evolved in the state of it currently check it out.

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:33.160
There's a little bit more cause there was a battle tech animated series that was done

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:42.320
in that universe produced by Saban, but yeah, apparently there's also books and mech warriors,

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:45.040
I guess kind of related in the same series.

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:53.160
So that also means then that the battle tech stuff is exactly what I was playing in tabletop.

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:54.160
So cool.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:55.160
There you go.

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:56.160
All right.

01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:00.440
Again, get an eight player pre-owned Derby owners club for only $26,000 Oh, is that all

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:11.160
that's all and like a whole room or two of your house dark Sakura, do you need a bedroom?

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:13.960
Which do you want more a bedroom or a Derby owners club machine?

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:22.400
Do you realize my bed takes up one whole room, all the crap in my office, two computers,

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:26.360
a TV, a bunch of video game stuff and all my crafting supplies.

01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:30.920
And then our game room, our legit game room that I probably could have put it in is taken

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:33.200
up by three pinball tables.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:36.980
And we've got five more in the garage and four in the house.

01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:40.120
She is not like, like, like this is not hyperbole.

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.600
This is, this is real.

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.260
Like I've been to this house.

01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:44.260
They really are.

01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:45.260
They have a room full of fucking people.

01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:49.140
And one of the ones that my house isn't even mine, which you need to come play before it

01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:50.140
gets reclaimed.

01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:51.520
Cause it scared Steph.

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:54.680
Well, I'm going to be gone for a little bit, but do you think Sega would Sue me if I made

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:58.240
a game called Derpy owners club, Derpy owners club.

01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:03.320
As long as it's full on parody, they can't under the rules of pair as long as it's parody.

01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:08.400
I'll consider that table that now another Loki game got derailed because he had got

01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:09.400
a better idea.

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:13.440
Derpy hooves is a copyright of Derpycon.

01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:14.440
Not Derpy.

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:17.280
We'll just do all sorts of Derpy shit.

01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:18.280
Okay.

01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:19.280
All right.

01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.520
Will you finish this one?

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:24.040
Oh yeah, of course.

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:27.480
He'll, he'll finish it more than he's finished any of the others.

01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:29.000
No, I'm not going to start a new game.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.280
I just thought that'd be a funny idea.

01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:34.200
I have lots of really dumb ideas for games that like are just floating around out there

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.200
that haven't made yet.

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.960
Why don't we do that as a bonus episode?

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:40.840
Loki tells us about all his dumb ideas for games.

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:43.400
Give us one, give us one.

01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:48.360
It would be like Pokemon go, but with roadkill and you would actually have to get like, so

01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:53.860
it's not necessarily roadkill per se, but you'd be capturing animals that are just ordinary

01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:54.860
animals.

01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:58.340
So it's, it's not like, um, you know, like Pikachu and stuff.

01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:01.700
It's like a squirrel, but we'd be calling them different things like trash pandas and

01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:02.700
stuff like that.

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:05.540
And then you would level up your characters, um, in the game.

01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:09.760
Like they have the little internet comics for a while where like they had like, uh,

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:14.100
it was like hamster fighting or whatever and they taped like knives to them and stuff like

01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:15.100
that.

01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:18.420
So it would be like that.

01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:22.940
And also I thought about a total adult version of like animal crossing, but like, you know,

01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:24.900
where you're selling crack and stuff like that on the street.

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:31.140
I think a lot of people have that, but the roadkill, but it's literally like, not really

01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:35.380
rogue actual roadkill, but it wouldn't be like actual roadkill would be like hamsters

01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:36.380
with claws.

01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:41.380
It would just be like, you know, like, Oh, I encountered an animal or like a monster,

01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:44.260
but it's just like, it's just an animal called something different.

01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:45.260
You know?

01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:46.260
Yes.

01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:47.260
Yes.

01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:52.580
Like danger noodles would be stuff like that.

01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:55.980
But it would be done in like a hillbilly, like trailer park aesthetic.

01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:56.980
Okay.

01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:57.980
Okay.

01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:58.980
That makes it better.

01:10:58.980 --> 01:10:59.980
Yes.

01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:00.980
There it is.

01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:02.980
Your classic game of the week.

01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:11.660
All right, anyway, uh, moving on, uh, let's travel around the world and check out some

01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:12.660
release dates.

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:17.260
So we're going to try to cover kind of a long period here through, uh, our next live show

01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:18.260
on the 15th.

01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:19.260
All right.

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:27.420
So, um, we've got, uh, grand blue fantasy versus on PlayStation four IB and OB on Nintendo

01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:34.660
switch murder by numbers on Nintendo switch and PC, uh, Pokemon mystery dungeon rescue

01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:42.260
team DX on Nintendo switch, uh, Langrisser one and two on PC, Nintendo switch and PlayStation

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:43.260
four.

01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:52.580
Um, let's see Orian, the will of the wisps on PC and Xbox one dead or school by on PlayStation

01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:59.980
four, my hero one just, or one's justice to that's on PC, Nintendo switch PlayStation

01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:02.480
four and Xbox one.

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:05.940
And last but not least Neo two on PlayStation four.

01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:06.940
All right.

01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:08.560
Heading over to Japan.

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:14.280
Let's check out switch releases for March 6th, which include a Pokemon Fushigi no dungeon.

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:16.360
That is obviously their version of mystery dungeon.

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:19.140
So that is out in Japan as well on the sixth.

01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:21.000
And then also coming out in Japan.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.320
Um, I think that's actually the only release on that particular day.

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:33.840
So jumping ahead to March the 12th, we have a human resource machine, deluxe toe our way.

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:39.240
Uh, no Palm refrain and color cross malice for Nintendo switch.

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:46.160
I guess that's, um, probably some type of, uh, uh, anime or, or manga or something.

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:50.920
Uh, but speaking of, if you're into the horsey games, winning post nine 2020 is also out

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:53.080
on the switch, uh, on March 12th.

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:54.540
So you have that to look forward to.

01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:57.680
So if you're, if you're missing your Derby owners club, you always have winning post

01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:02.680
to look forward to, uh, checking out the PlayStation four to see what the big releases are there.

01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:04.760
You know, I don't see anything that early, early March.

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:08.260
I don't really start seeing releases till March 12th where winning post nine is also

01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:09.760
out on the PlayStation four.

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:13.320
Um, Kondagawa jet girls is out as well.

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:18.200
And uh, some price reductions on far cry, new Dawn, the crew too, and assassin's creed

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:21.880
odyssey as they move into Japan's equivalent of like best hits.

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:22.880
Okay.

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:23.880
How about Europe?

01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:28.840
Um, in Europe, well, we're starting just with the beginning of March, right?

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:29.840
Cause sure.

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:30.840
Yeah.

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:31.840
Yeah.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:38.200
Cause there's a bunch on the 27th, but yeah, anyway, but that already happened.

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:39.200
Yeah, sure.

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:40.200
It did.

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:45.880
So on the fifth we have Carly and the Reaper man, which sounds like a fun game, uh, escape

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:46.880
from the underworld.

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:53.360
Um, also on the fifth we have Pokemon mysterious dungeon rescue team DX Ori and the will of

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:58.560
the wis on the 10th on the 11th we have overpass on the 12th we have bleeding edge beta.

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:06.800
Um, also doctor who the edge of time for PlayStation hell warders, um, on the 12th, my hero one

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.480
justice too.

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:18.480
That's uh, from the, my hero academia, um, uh, Neil, uh, two on, uh, March, uh, 12th.

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:22.400
And on the 16th we have remnant from the ashes.

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:27.000
I might've gone too far, but I don't care.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000
All right.

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:33.840
I might add the week after we do our next show, animal crossing will become, I know

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:34.840
it's almost here.

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:35.840
It's exciting.

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:36.840
Mm hmm.

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:37.840
Exciting stuff.

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:38.840
Three weeks away.

01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:39.840
I needs.

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:40.840
All right.

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:44.560
Well, uh, that's about going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio, but

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.560
here's here.

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:50.800
So I was just texted this by a friend of mine, apparently, uh, the first us coronavirus case

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:55.680
of unknown origin just confirmed in Northern California.

01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:00.280
And I guess it's the individual is a resident of Solano County and is receiving medical

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:01.440
care in Sacramento County.

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:03.480
I thought there was the one that came back from Japan.

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:04.480
Yeah.

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:08.960
There's a Korean lady now going around Southern California in Korea town that turned out she

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:09.960
is infected.

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:10.960
Huh?

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:13.880
The individual had no known exposure to the virus through travel or close contact with

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:14.880
a known infected individual.

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:18.800
Oh, but it's like I said, they already confirmed that it was airborne.

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:19.800
Yeah.

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:20.800
So fun.

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:24.440
Well, I hope they in contact with Corona's.

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:25.440
I blame that.

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:27.240
I hope I get to go on my cruise.

01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:28.240
All right.

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:33.800
So, so that means that I am going to go buy some more lysine and do things that boost

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:35.120
up my immune system.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:40.000
But the people I'm more worried for are my friends who are immunocompromised, you know,

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:46.160
my friend's child, a couple of friends of mine dealing with AIDS and HIV, elderly individuals,

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:47.160
elderly.

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:48.160
Yeah.

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:51.640
Um, just do the things that will boost your immune system.

01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:58.280
Don't be stupid, but do the things that are, just be intelligent about it.

01:15:58.280 --> 01:15:59.280
Yeah.

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:01.200
Take, take normal precautions.

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:06.640
Don't go around with a gas mask, you know, if you are immunocompromised, it might not

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:13.680
be beyond the scope of reason to have maybe a, an N5 or N95.

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:21.600
But again, be smart and learn how to fucking wash your goddamn hands the right way.

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:23.200
Not just a little water.

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:33.120
You have to scrub your hands and get in your nails and up at least past your wrist bone

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:35.640
to be considered having properly washed your hands.

01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:38.920
And you sing happy birthday twice.

01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:39.920
Yes.

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:40.920
All right.

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:46.800
So, and, and, and what do not touch blood or bodily fluid?

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:53.340
I'm just saying because, well, it's just, oh, I'm probably going to be renewing my first

01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:55.800
aid cert in the light of all this.

01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:56.800
So.

01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:57.800
All right.

01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:02.120
Well, to practice good hygiene, everybody, uh, we're going to wrap up final thoughts.

01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:05.480
Uh, thank you guys for tuning into this special episode of orange launch radio.

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:08.560
Um, especially since, you know, we're, I'm out of town for a couple of weeks.

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:10.440
Uh, we are planning to be back on March 15th.

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:11.840
I guess I have to phrase it that way.

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:16.240
Now we're planning to be back on March 15th, um, live over at vognetwork.com.

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:20.360
So we really hope to see you guys then, uh, but otherwise it's time to wrap things up.

01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:21.360
We're done here for the week.

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:24.720
So, um, if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange on radio, please tell a friend or

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:25.720
two about the show.

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.080
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has voice, but if the

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:31.080
voices aren't here to put out on air, then what are we going to do?

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:39.760
So, um, also very important to say, uh, that, um, uh, uh, sharing the show, uh, hosting

01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:42.440
on Twitch, all of that stuff goes a long way.

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:45.880
We'll have a very, uh, long episode probably on March 15th to catch up on everything we

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:49.240
missed because I'm sure there's going to be a lot between GDC and packs and everything

01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:50.240
else.

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:51.240
Uh, it's going to be something.

01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:54.400
I hope you guys will still be checking out Bobby Black Wolf and other independent podcasts

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:58.400
on not just at vognetwork.com, but all up and down the wonderful interwebs.

01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:00.080
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:01.080
Dark Sakura.

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:04.160
Um, I don't know.

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:06.680
My brain is mushy.

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:07.680
It's mushy.

01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:12.320
My appropriate final thought for tonight would be live long and prosper.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.120
Loki, your final thought.

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:19.800
Uh, my final thought is that, um, I don't know.

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:20.800
I don't have anything.

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:21.800
I'm tired.

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:22.800
That's it.

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:28.000
On that note, rest up, play some games, make your, make your, uh, some more Minecraft cause

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000
that's mindless.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.560
Ooh, actually I was literally about to hit the credits button.

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:33.560
Dark Sakura.

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:34.920
Well, it's just a little thing.

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:37.040
Bob, Bob Iger stepped down as Disney CEO.

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:38.520
I haven't yesterday.

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:39.520
It was just posted today.

01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:40.520
So sorry.

01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:41.520
That's all right.

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:42.520
Okay.

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:45.940
GameStop will give you $5 a month if you do their pro subscription cause they're desperate

01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:46.940
for business.

01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:49.040
Do I have permission to end the goddamn show?

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:50.040
Maybe.

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:51.040
Yes.

01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:52.040
Good night.

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:55.240
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

01:18:55.240 --> 01:19:01.200
