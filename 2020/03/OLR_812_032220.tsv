0	17960	This week Doom Eternal isn't in the show role but it has to be mentioned that it's
17960	21560	a fantastic game and it's load times are incredible.
21560	24500	This is what I wanted to say, stay tuned for your host stories of the week starting right
24500	28840	now in the show where every gamer has a voice including Jason.
28840	34960	Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet
34960	39320	and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice it is Orange
39320	47200	Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 812 for this March the 22nd of 2020.
47200	53260	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined in studio by Captain Pikachu at my side so here's what's
53260	54260	going on.
54260	58500	This is a little different for Orange Lounge Radio tonight even though I am here in studio
58500	64680	N7 because if you haven't figured it out by now studio N7 is at my house so I'm here.
64680	70400	My co-host tonight we're doing a little bit of social distancing as many folks out there
70400	75440	in the world are doing because it's the right thing to do to help slow the spread of this
75440	78560	horrible thing that's going around that's really you know affecting us all and affecting
78560	79560	our world right now.
79560	84180	So I am joined though thanks to the magic of discord I am joined tonight by of course
84180	86840	DarkSakura or Jamie Summers should be there.
87380	87880	Hi.
87880	88880	Hi how are you?
89880	95140	Um I had a flare-up but um hopefully healing so we'll see.
95140	101240	Now as a follow-up to last week you found out that you have pneumonia and not the big
101240	103040	C right?
103040	110460	That's what she said but um I just finished my antibiotics and um I had a flare-up last
110460	117080	night so I don't know um what's going on but I was I had a couple days with no fever
117080	124200	and then I started running a fever again last night running a fever today so we'll see.
124200	128100	Well my fingers and toes and I'm sure all of us are crossed that uh everything is gonna
128100	132760	go just fine with your recovery it's it's one of those really weird kind of uh states
132760	139360	of the world in 2020 where we're sitting here going yay it's just pneumonia when that's
139360	144300	actually not particularly a great thing to be talking about so but um in all seriousness
144300	149320	thank you for being here tonight um despite how you're feeling um but I mean I've relatively
149320	153460	is your energy's been there you've been able to play games and do stuff around the house?
153460	160740	Well that not that that requires a whole lot of uh energy but um I've uh I've been playing
160740	167740	a lot of a lot of stuff on my switch you know what I'm playing and I baked bread which wasn't
167740	173240	the best idea but it was delicious. Well hey it's uh hard to find bread at some of the
173240	177720	stores right now so I'm I hear a lot of people yeah I hear a lot of people are kind of baking
177720	182600	right now um speaking of baking uh also joining us tonight via discord I believe should be
182600	187320	there is Techmaster Loki. I'm not baking anything. I thought I thought you said something about
187320	192840	the air fryer before we went live. Oh oh no that that's yeah that's Nellie cooking dinner
192840	198240	I'm sure it's like some Asian or something. Gotcha okay so again um this is a little new
198240	203180	for us uh here at Orange Launch Radio you know we started this show back in 2002 if
203180	208980	you were unaware and um you know in that year we didn't really have you know when we started
208980	213720	this whole thing on the Live 365 network we were dial-up friendly radios so that was the
213720	216980	way many people were still connecting to the internet so we didn't have things like Skype
216980	220520	and you know all that there was no iPhone yet or any type of smartphone really at that
220520	226340	point um and so we kind of got used to doing this show in the same room um and that's kind
226340	229980	of where this show you know and when people ask like well it makes you different than
229980	233760	other gaming podcasts I can talk about how long we've been around but also I think part
233760	237800	of what makes us a little bit different is that uh we are usually all in the same room
237800	241880	so we can kind of play off each other and all that stuff um but obviously as you guys
241880	246900	know being in the same room is not really an option right now I mean I guess technically
246900	252160	the whole stay at home thing would allow like six people to get together but the reality
252160	257420	is um if you can practice social distancing you should so we're setting an example I hope
257420	260980	tonight by doing things a little differently but therefore my point with that is the audio
260980	264900	quality may not be quite what you're used to so you'll have to forgive us a little bit
264900	270580	um but you know we had to kind of throw things together as they say uh to make tonight's
270580	275360	show happen uh thanks to the magic of discord so um but of course if you do want to join
275360	280280	us live you can we do tape live every sunday night at the voice geeks network twitch.tv
280280	285680	slash vog network we're on at 6 p.m pacific nine o'clock eastern right after the bobby
285680	291320	black wolf show um again that's over twitch.tv slash vog network and yes bobby does have
291320	295960	a good point here um bobby says podcasts are technically exempt from the shelter in place
295960	300640	ruling at least in los angeles county but I wouldn't expect a gaming podcast to risk
300640	306340	that and yeah it's one of those things where it's like you know if um if maybe our podcast
306340	312200	was uh spreading awareness about disease prevention or was like a news-based podcast or something
312200	317040	a little more like you know uh traditional media I suppose where there's a benefit for
317040	321960	us all being in the same room or out in the field reporting so to speak then yeah we could
321960	325960	bend the rules a little bit but since you know we I've heard that we're an essential
325960	331280	podcast though so it's fine we can skirt by all of the laws because of that we are
331280	335600	an essential podcast I've I believe that's that's the rule that we're setting orange
335600	340880	launch radio essential podcasting uh so well okay funny you bring that up because obviously
340880	345920	that's going to tie into tonight's kickoff topic which I'm sure is on a lot of people's
345920	349880	minds uh this week as they've been reading all the updates with what's going on in the
349880	354000	world um dark sakura why don't you start us off because I know you had some thoughts when
354000	365080	it came to this topic um well um it's uh I have friends that work there number one
365080	369120	and one of my friends flat out told me when I was talking about picking up my pre-order
369120	375760	because I had actually switched it to her store um is that um I should just not pick
375760	382300	up my game and get it digitally or from somewhere else um after having talked to her she was
382300	388260	like yeah and was linking me to all these other people they were telling you know their
388260	393100	the press release at game stop was saying that they were sending cleaning material and
393100	397580	hand sanitizer to all the stores which was a lie they were telling the managers to go
397580	402420	get them and of course where are they there's none to be found and they were having to pay
402420	409580	for it out of pocket so um and they were telling people to go home if they were sick but they
409580	415180	were calling people in while they were sick because they didn't have enough people to
415180	421220	watch the desk or anything like that to keep the store open so um you know it was it was
421220	428380	really terrible um and then of course it was putting longer hours on the people who were
428380	435520	okay to work and you know and then on top of that they're endangering people by having
435520	443600	people come in by not maintaining um any type of proper social distancing and so um and on top
443600	447320	of that they're not a freaking essential business I'm sorry well I'm not sorry because they're not
447320	452160	yeah and it sounds like you know it's interesting because you know we've taught and I've mentioned
452160	456640	this on the show and I'm sure we have folks that work at GameStop stores that listen to this show
456640	462160	and I hope you all understand the issues that we've taken up with you know the evil G or whatever
462160	466680	you want to call it over the years has nothing to do with the hard-working folks at the stores
466680	474080	or even the store managers it's and and I think nothing has ever made this more apparent than
474080	478760	this particular story we're talking about now with what's going on with COVID is that you know
478760	483960	and you mentioned like you're being told under the table essentially by employees like yo don't come
483960	488360	in here because what they're telling you isn't the reality of what's going on they're not saying
488360	493320	and I mean that is a huge disconnect when the corporate is saying oh yeah we're we're sending
493320	497800	out sanitizer and all that really cuz we're all having a hard time finding it but okay but we're
497800	501540	gonna go make our so they're saying they're sending it all out but that's not true they're
501540	505640	making the store managers as if they didn't have to go through enough go out and find this stuff
505640	511680	when we all know we all have a television that or radio or whatever you use we all know that you
511680	517640	can't find that stuff right now so to say that these stores are all stock to that is is untrue
517640	525000	and it's it's it's really irresponsible and I I suppose you could make a stretch argument that
525000	530960	maybe GameStop deals somewhat in computing supplies and those computing supplies would
530960	536720	be important to teleworkers but let's be real that's not what GameStop was selling on Friday
536720	542240	night GameStop was selling all those pre-orders of Animal Crossing and Doom Eternal that they
542240	547440	wanted to keep those sales on and I think that was pretty apparent and what was going on yeah
547760	556960	they it's really you know and not to go on too much of the political side of things but you know
556960	564680	we're we're watching the crumbling of capitalism right now because people are trying to first of
564680	570920	all you know make a profit at the expense of other people that that's really how I see it you know I
571160	577800	mean but on top of that though with so many businesses closing down it's really people
577800	581280	don't have a way of bringing in the money and people aren't going out and spending it either
581280	587720	so I you know I you can't blame I'm equal you can't blame them but but in the same run when
587720	593760	your company is at the core of itself in the business to make money it doesn't really feel
593760	600400	responsible to the public that comes out right then and there in in the public so yeah and I
600400	606640	think I think you can definitely you know still say like you know without being political I think
606640	610800	there's definitely going to be a conversation around all there's gonna be conversation about
610800	615280	people being able to stay home sick when they're actually sick there's gonna be a conversation
615280	620200	about you know being able to access health care and getting health care needs and whether that
620200	624640	should be tied to having a job or not and you know now I don't know what the answer is to that
624760	631720	some folks will be you know with Bernie on that some folks will be with more middle-ground Democrats
631720	636560	on that some people will be with Trump or possibly Mitt Romney or other Republicans on that because
636560	641160	there's all sorts of different answers out there but I think a conversation will certainly be had
641160	647000	certainly be had especially just real quick sorry especially with the I guess this would be
647000	652640	appropriate use of the term she's in Freud where you have you know the one senator who voted
652640	657480	against the one of the stimulus packages has now come down with coronavirus I mean the fact that
657480	663960	this is now on Washington DC's doorstep literally and cannot be ignored no matter how you feel about
663960	667920	that politician or any of that stuff the fact that is on their doorstep and cannot be ignored
667920	674040	that is going to cause a conversation to happen if nothing else I will point this out though that
674040	684760	right now Bernie did take his campaign resources and immediately filtered it into providing
684760	696160	services to people who are ill jobless and to fighting the the spread of the disease I hope
696160	701960	we see all of Washington DC follow suit very soon it is you haven't seen Biden do it we have
701960	707520	definitely seen a lot of companies that are really stepping up to be able to like I saw one going on
707520	710800	Twitter and I apologize I forget the name of the company in the moment they're coming up and making
710800	716440	masks Oh Christian Siriano the fashion designer famous from Project Runway is starting to make
716440	721400	more masks for you know New York and and because there's obviously a big outbreak there and so
721400	725320	forth so I think you're definitely gonna see and to tie this back to video games you're definitely
725320	730280	starting to see when it comes to the corporations who the people are that are stepping up right and
730280	735280	who the people are that are slipping down and GameStop is one of those companies that's slipping
735280	741480	down because of all this at a time when GameStop needs not to be slipping down and again I feel for
741480	747400	a lot of those people on the front lines and so forth because these bad decisions are not theirs
747400	753440	but it's making everybody a GameStop look bad and it's it's really unfortunate and I got two words
753440	759800	hostile takeover and I know a lot of people are talking maybe Reggie will come in there and
759800	765120	reminder Reggie has nothing to do with this if you go back and listen there go go Google News
765120	769640	search the Reggie thing and his thing about joining GameStop that's not effective until
769640	777560	mid-april so Reggie has nothing to do with any of this in fact he might reverse decision as a result
777560	784920	I don't know the contracts may already be signed I don't know but the reality is Reggie's gonna be
784920	790040	walking into something big but again he's not gonna be the CEO he's gonna be a member of the
790040	795440	board but I don't know if he's gonna necessarily be the hero that everybody hopes he is but we
795440	801400	hope there is a hero at GameStop or that comes in and buys them or something and turns them around
801400	809200	I think so anyway Loki I don't know if you had some other things you wanted to add to this I
809200	814280	know you've been following a lot of what's going around with GameStop right yeah so there was quite
814280	818200	a few stories like cuz the whole thing was kind of developing over the week so you first you had
818200	823760	of course what Jamie alluded to where there was the memos going out to store saying that they're
823760	829040	going to be providing them with you know disinfectant supplies and you basically stuff to
829040	835240	kind of stave off some of the germs and everything that might be there you know kind of the same
835240	842520	message a lot of different locations were saying and then there was the whole recommendation that
842520	850320	they should close you know non-essential retailers and then of course GameStop making the argument
850320	860000	that well we are essential retail and we're going to you know fight that order and basically the
860000	865840	employees just not even happy with that at all I mean just very much against it a lot of folks
865840	872160	quitting over this but it's almost like they suddenly unionized they didn't say that word
872160	876480	but you know when everybody kind of bands together to do the it's interesting it's very interesting
876800	882480	oh yeah absolutely and then and then what was kind of crazy too is along the same time there
882480	891000	was this one youtuber that leaked a call with the executives is one of the GameStop calls that they
891000	896280	had talking about the whole situation and everything and that did not sound well because there's a lot
896280	902000	of concerned employees that were basically asking me hey what's gonna happen you know you're telling
902000	907360	us to come in and you know we're not gonna get paid if we take time off or whatever you know I
907360	912240	don't want to be exposed to this I'm you know living with my elderly grandma I I don't want to
912240	918440	expose her to kovin 19 and you know they didn't really have much a response other than well we're
918440	923200	taking a day at a time and that type of stuff and then kind of funny you know after a whole
923200	929240	California you know officially you know say okay you guys have to all close finally then did they
929240	935960	actually close their doors but before that you know obviously you could tell what the goal was
935960	940920	because they were putting out their pre-orders for both Animal Crossing and Doom Eternal early
940920	947800	and then you know some of the follow-up with that it sounds like that finally the CEO is gonna give
947800	954480	them some paid time off and some compensation for coming in on these days and then I did find that
954480	960600	one funny screenshot where they in Pennsylvania they've yanked their business license at least so
960600	965040	that was kind of interesting is that is that proven because that I saw that I think we all
965040	970200	many of us saw that picture of the printout that was on the door or something but that didn't look
970200	974600	very official to me like it looked like especially something that would use aerial black like that
974600	979120	that's just a very it just looked whipped up I don't know word I just yeah I don't know be a
979120	983280	little bit you guys and maybe I'm wrong it may have been an official thing because it was whipped
983280	988360	up quickly but I don't think there's anything wrong with you have a healthy healthy dose of
988360	992840	skepticism with all this crazy amount of news that's coming out about you know the the COVID
992840	1000960	and all that yeah so here's they have they did send out a letter to from the CEO George Sherman
1000960	1006840	sent out to all of the associates basically saying that effective immediately we've implemented the
1006840	1011440	following for hourly associates that work at source that close or close in the future as a
1011520	1017720	result of COVID-19 any associate directly impacted by COVID-19 at work is required to quarantine
1017720	1024800	hourly employees who are paid time or have PTO are eligible will receive 80 hours of additional
1024800	1031800	PTO in the event that you're not to PTO eligible you'll be paying for we will be paying you for two
1031800	1036720	additional weeks of base pay calculated by the weekly average number hours you work in addition
1036720	1041000	if your full-time benefit eligible employee will be receiving reimbursement for one month
1041000	1047000	of employee benefit contributions for the month of April so at least that's something yeah a little
1047000	1052160	after like dragging them through the street screaming I mean we'll give them we'll give them
1052160	1058960	light snaps on a little light snaps and and still you know question some of the decisions I do want
1058960	1064160	to address what's the discussion happening in the chat room because Tiger Claw is mentioning I posted
1064160	1067920	a screenshot of the notice and has a picture of the notice but you know respectfully Tiger Claw
1068000	1071680	I realize that's what a lot of people are looking at because I saw the reddit post and everything
1071680	1076120	but I actually question that thing's legitimacy and I'm gonna tell you what it is for me there's
1076120	1081920	no wet signature on that and that means that it's been signed I would think any type of actual order
1081920	1085840	to close a business I'm pretty much sure anytime I've ever seen that posted in the window has a
1085840	1094840	signature from either a sheriff who served it or a judge or the county's like there's no signature
1094840	1099400	on there and I'm sorry that's again a healthy dose of skepticism I'm not necessarily saying it's all
1099400	1104480	bullshit but then Bobby says there's literally no official news sources that say Pennsylvania
1104480	1109720	revoked their business license the governor of Pennsylvania did have harsh words but did not
1109720	1116240	take that action and so yeah so I actually I don't think a GameStop was officially closed now did an
1116240	1122080	employee now I'm not saying the sign didn't exist because did an employee whip up that sign because
1122120	1127240	they didn't want to go to work that day and felt unsafe there but possibly there's a lot
1127240	1133680	of that's absolutely possible but there's a lot of explanations out there not necessarily the one
1133680	1140080	that read it's telling you and I think keep that in mind and it's it's very easy to fall for these
1140080	1145200	types of things in this day and age on the internet the other one I'm hearing is not true and I haven't
1145200	1149960	done my own research on this but you know there's the stories going around about how the Venice
1149960	1155800	canals like dolphins and fish are swimming in the canal apparently that one's not true and so
1155800	1163680	interesting so just be careful about all the news that goes around right now it's a tricky time you
1163680	1169920	know there should always be a way to like double source something if you're seeing it from one
1169920	1174200	source hmm especially if that source is read it if you've seen it from two sources especially if
1174200	1180560	one of them is CNN NBC CBS heck Fox I'll allow it when it comes to figuring out if something's
1180560	1187880	legitimate or not in a double validation sort of thing double validate it that's all I'm saying so
1187880	1196680	anyway okay and yeah some folks are saying s200 Matt says no state source would recommend people
1196680	1201120	wear and n95 masks are telling people not to buy those masks because there's a shortage and
1201240	1208880	healthcare people need those yeah so anyway just I'm gonna throw in something yeah just because I
1208880	1213280	used to do property inspections for commercial properties oh yeah back in the day I remember
1213280	1219240	that yeah that sign really isn't too far-fetched to me first of all a lot of those offices are not
1219240	1226400	on max the standard font is aerial at least a lot of them have an upgraded computers and things like
1226400	1235560	that what does give me a little bit of pause is that the way the the extra text on it and on top
1235560	1242200	of that the fact that it looks like it's cut off but those actually are fairly in line with
1242200	1251600	condemnation images like that I linked one from the city of Baltimore now there's are in like a
1251600	1258280	bright yellow I have seen them in white I have seen them just a piece but just a letter written
1258280	1267600	on business head it really is going to vary from place to place and I am suspect of it simply
1267600	1275720	because it is cut off at the bottom I would have expected to have had like you know a professional
1275720	1281920	letter something on cardstock too or at least a heavy paper but I'm not saying I'm I'm saying
1281920	1289880	that font typography choice what have you that actually is not far-fetched but no no signature
1289880	1293960	required that's the thing that's hanging me up I've seen some that have signatures I've seen
1293960	1301440	others that don't a lot of them will have like contact you know X for for that and but usually
1301600	1306600	they will say let me go back and look at it the biggest thing that they're gonna say is
1306600	1316880	the nature of the closure this doesn't give any of it and again with that being cut off it actually
1316880	1323760	looks like it's more of a photocopy of something so those are the things that make me think it's
1323760	1328440	not legitimate not necessarily how it's laid out all right analyzing the receipts with dark
1328440	1340880	Sakura you should seriously consider I mean now is the time to start thinking about those side
1340880	1344360	projects and podcasts you always wanted to do because all of us have a lot of free time all
1344360	1348680	of a sudden you should I would love to see you do a show called like analyzing the receipts where
1348680	1353360	you take like big reddit stories and Facebook shares and try to figure out if they're BS or
1353360	1358280	not although I suppose that's kind of like double double doing what Snopes does but you know I don't
1359120	1362440	think Snopes has the time for this type of thing like they don't care about this one little Game
1362440	1368760	Stop in Pennsylvania actually funny that you mentioned that Snopes has a big letter on their
1368760	1374080	main page looking for a donation so they can keep up what they're doing because they've been
1374080	1384760	inundated with so I would say people can help Snopes out this is a really important time for
1384760	1390040	us to make sure we have factual information going out and this isn't the time to be posting
1390040	1397240	stuff oh well it was funny or oh it sounded like it could have been right fact check every fucking
1397240	1403800	thing before you post it because lives depend on yeah be very careful right now in social media
1403800	1411120	there's so much there's so much going around all right I will absolutely call you out Loki we we
1411120	1413840	we've got off base a little bit I don't know if there was anything else you want to add to the
1413880	1420000	GameStop saga no that's pretty much it they said that the stores that are gonna remain open which
1420000	1427840	I can't imagine that's gonna be for very long are doing my guess I guess you can pick up at the door
1427840	1434080	type of stuff where you can order through the app I mean do people really need physical games that
1434080	1439960	badly I don't know well Bobby shared a story about Animal Crossing and how you can't share
1439960	1444160	a digital copy so if him and his wife will both want to play it makes more sense for them to have
1444160	1449080	a physical copy so like I kind of get those types of scenarios and you know I I we've talked we've
1449080	1453200	had the digital versus physical debate here on this show before some people just prefer to have
1453200	1457880	something tangible that they can eventually sell back since you know GameStop is kind of in that
1457880	1464440	business but long story short the the whole drive up solution I think is is a fair compromise and
1464440	1469280	probably what should have been implemented in the first place interestingly enough they're not the
1469280	1472520	only business to be doing something like that I believe Best Buy is starting something like that
1472520	1478600	very soon which you know now even more so with Best Buy yes I could see where Best Buy is very
1478600	1483200	important right now with so many people or in stores like it I don't want to give them free
1483200	1487600	advertising but electronic stores will say in general because with so many people working from
1487600	1493800	home you have what if what if a monitor goes bad what if a power cord or you got to replace a surge
1493800	1498160	protector things like that that makes a lot more sense you got to drive up and and to be fair
1498200	1504120	GameStop has a limited amount but they do have some of those things I guess so what if I don't
1504120	1509640	have my Funko pops and they can't work but yeah the one of my desk just fell over but anyway um
1509640	1514320	yeah like the drive-up thing makes a lot more sense um Allen actually just went out to get
1514320	1520920	pet food because not only do we have to eat but mr. smoosh has to eat and mr. smoosh because if
1520920	1524240	you guys have seen him which if you watch live on twitch he's always there at the beginning of the
1524240	1529840	show you see that his face is smoosh it's actually not why we call him that we call him mr. smoosh
1529840	1533760	because when you put out your hand for him to like lick your finger or something he will just ram
1533760	1537720	his whole face into your hand he smooshes his face in your hands that's why we call mr. smoosh
1537720	1543000	but he does have a smoosh face so he doesn't really have much of a nose so we have to buy a
1543000	1548400	very specific type of pet food for him that is very smelly we have to buy like very smelly fish
1548640	1554560	cat food or else he doesn't know he doesn't recognize that it's food really so we go to
1554560	1560200	a specialty pet food store and that's what they do he Allen drives up in the car basically and
1560200	1566800	I think he did walk up to a table and they went in the store got it brought it out rung it up
1566800	1573160	hand sanitizer for both of them right outside and on to the next person that comes up so this whole
1573160	1578040	concept of like drive up get what you need and leave is being implemented in other places as
1578200	1588280	well not just what what GameStop's got going on also things to point out here Bobby Blackwell
1588280	1593560	pointing out Best Buy also sells kitchen appliances so they're a little more essential I didn't think
1593560	1597080	about that what if I mean what if the fridge breaks down during this whole thing or the
1597080	1601720	freezer you know you got you got to worry about that but they aren't doing in-home delivery of
1601720	1606080	those appliances they'll drop the new fridge at your front door and tell you good luck yikes
1606800	1611240	that's gonna make it a little more difficult but nothing a good old YouTube search can't solve
1611240	1617320	hopefully when it comes to installing anything you can find it on YouTube somewhere I'm sure so
1617320	1624080	anyway yeah lots of lots of crazy changes that are gonna be happening and you know crossing our
1624080	1630680	fingers and toes that we're talking about weeks and not months but be prepared for anything the
1630680	1636520	official statement is eight to ten weeks yeah it could it could be some time so and we're seeing
1636520	1641920	a lot of stuff as far out as May getting cancelled even some June I mean we know about e3 and so
1641920	1651120	forth but I just saw today Portland retro Expo got cancelled and they were in I actually think
1651120	1656400	I feel like they're all the way out in like July or August but they're more concerned about well
1656520	1662800	they can't predict the future and what's gonna go on but also be just the fact that you know with
1662800	1668280	all this going on the economic impact of the small businesses that the retro convention tends to you
1668280	1672600	know attract and things like that like it's just so hard to know so there's there's events all
1672600	1676760	summer that are starting to get cancelled dark soccer you post on Facebook the California
1676760	1680760	pinball thing got cancelled too and that was during the summer right Golden State pinball
1680760	1688880	it's in May and actually I was just I saw something go up that says a bay is considering
1688880	1696240	postponing the Olympics in Japan yeah so that's tragic Jamie I mean where are you gonna go to play
1696240	1707960	pinball now that still but also some of the events for the sisters were cancelled our Easter thing
1708360	1716960	well they said postponed pride and I think LA is getting no not la Placerville I think one of them
1716960	1722960	is getting you're right la la is got cancelled straight out a couple other places I have moved
1722960	1730640	there so August Davis did Davis did that's it so yeah it's just a lot of a lot of stuff going on
1730640	1736760	so you know fingers and toes crossed the Dragon Con still happens but I'm trying to mentally
1736840	1742000	prepare myself for the fact that it might not but I'm trying to be optimistic and you know I know
1742000	1746440	there's other optimistic folks out there so I'm trying to stay that weapon of just preparing
1746440	1750880	myself for that possibility is you know it just might be the case we were gonna be doing a live
1750880	1755720	showing of clue in April obviously that got pushed back it got pushed back to June I'm getting
1755720	1761640	worried it's gonna get pushed back again but if that's what it takes to save people especially
1761640	1767640	elderly folks and so forth then it's it's what we got to do so all right well one thing I'm
1767640	1772720	sure we're all doing right now in this time is playing a lot of video games to get by so let's
1772720	1776280	talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week and we'll
1776280	1781120	start with dark soccer as if I had any question whatsoever as to what she's been playing this
1781120	1789840	week sorry I've been muting my mic as I have to cough a lot no you're fine well it's been
1789840	1795880	Animal Crossing I keep forgetting to look at pocket camp even I might even just quit playing
1795880	1808000	it but I am really enjoying New Horizons I am on my third loan starting tomorrow and I should be
1808000	1815960	able to save up everything to pay it off tonight I I've already recruited new new villagers to move
1815960	1823600	in a place their houses and actually trying to get furniture for one of the houses now it adds a lot
1823600	1829720	more to the game I think with all of these kind of fetch quest II things if that makes sense sure
1829720	1837320	but but I streamed my first day playing I finally got my audio to work for one whole stream I joined
1837360	1845920	your stream justice you were saying good night I ended up just being really really exhausted and
1845920	1851280	it was I was sitting in a folding chair because it's kind of a crappy setup I have where I had
1851280	1856440	my MacBook with that elgato plugged into it but for some reason the switch doesn't do the output
1856440	1867040	to TV and to my Mac at the same time so I'm only getting audio on on the capture HD app so up to
1867040	1872440	date everything I've done all my troubleshooting OBS doesn't work with it at all hmm yeah so I
1872440	1877320	haven't it just doesn't even detect the the card and I've done of course all the troubleshooting I
1877320	1885520	have no excuse not to know how to do it so if it happens again I might have to rethink how I'm
1885520	1897480	doing it but yeah I played how many I started it at 9 and played until 3 a.m. and then yesterday
1897480	1904800	I played for 10 hours no Friday I paid played for 10 hours yesterday I played for about six
1904800	1911240	hours but I started getting so ill that I had to lay down and today I played for a couple and then
1911240	1916200	I took a nap and now I'm doing the show wow you're making me you're making me look like a filthy
1916200	1920360	casual I haven't even opened the game yet today I'm supposed to I'm supposed to get my museum
1920360	1926680	finally today I'm so behind like I haven't even found the nuggets to get the store yet I should
1926680	1930880	have them tonight if I play if I play a little bit after the show which I probably will I should
1930880	1940960	have the nuggets tonight are you going to the the island I went to one island but I was saving my
1941000	1947920	nook points to get the inventory expansion and the tool the tool act the circular tool access thing
1947920	1955120	because those sounded very important and then I just barely got another 2,000 miles but I was like
1955120	1960000	oh I should save these because maybe when I pay off the loan it's gonna open up even more inventory
1960000	1965600	space or something but keep in mind by opening the museum and all the other things you get many
1965600	1970560	many more nook miles I've been spending them like like they're going out of like they're
1970560	1978640	going out of fashion okay and I still have 13,000 look miles right now so what do you think of the
1978640	1983800	new Animal Crossing game compared to the old ones this one has a lot more to do with it by the way
1983800	1990880	let me continue one other thing sorry get your first get your first loan oh yeah already work
1990880	1998040	I already have the house okay good because what you get those extra five items on top of your nook
1998040	2006120	miles app yeah those give you miles like for doing basic shit yeah the little dailies I call
2006120	2011800	them dailies even though they just kind of keep going but yeah I've cycled through 30 of them in
2011800	2017160	a day but that if this is one of the new things that this new Animal Crossing game kind of brings
2017160	2021800	in that the old ones didn't have is that you have like these you know daily quests but then
2021800	2026640	once you finish them little other short quests kind of pop in so this was a mechanism and you
2026640	2031320	get these nook miles which are not the same thing as currency but you can use them to get either the
2031320	2035280	trips to the random island or I think they have like hairstyles shirts there's certain things that
2035280	2041040	are tied I've unlocked all the hairstyles half the clothes are ugly but I did get a leaf rug
2041040	2051960	and I got the umbrella I you also if you check the terminal every day you get nook miles if you
2051960	2058840	you also every so often get achievements for just buying regular stuff so the the store changes
2058840	2066440	daily not just with Tommy but in the the kiosk and did you find where to buy the other recipes
2066440	2074040	from Tommy I think which which recipes if you talk to him to buy something you hit your R trigger
2074040	2082880	and it gives you another thing to buy like basic items yeah I think I did get that medicine yeah
2082880	2090640	I'm just gonna tell you also save up three wasp nests so you can make a flooring later on the
2090640	2095840	other advantage of going to the islands is that almost everyone that I've been to had a message
2095840	2102560	in a bottle with the new DIY okay yeah the one the one I went to had a new person that wanted to
2102560	2107880	move to my island and I was like okay which by the way I love my default villagers they're so
2107880	2114280	great I got like the perfect I got one oh did you know school I got Agnes and I got Dom Agnes
2114280	2119480	is the black pig and Dom is this like Ram that wears a rainbow shirt and talks about his muscles
2119480	2126480	all the time nice and I got on one of the islands I'm getting chevra who I like one of my favorite
2126480	2135080	are the goats and the guy can't remember his name he's the takoyaki head guy that looks like takoyaki
2135080	2142040	oh yeah and see Brad got BAM and cherry who are like two of my favorites but I need to get Dina
2142040	2148240	I'm gonna order Dina when I can all right Dean is my resident lesbian anyway any other thoughts
2148280	2155640	on that Animal Crossing for for now it really takes the formula and expands upon it and it
2155640	2161920	really it it'd be like I've got to do what to get what but the busywork makes the time fly and gives
2161920	2169160	you so much more to do it and Ed will die Brad I will hit him with my axe in his head until he dies
2169160	2176680	by the way speaking of the axe I highly suggest if you make the full axe still keep a stone axe
2176680	2181480	on hand because you can whack a tree three times with the stone axe and it won't fall over you
2181480	2186160	whack it three times with a regular axe and that you'll lose the tree oh I didn't know that that's
2186160	2191200	good to know I thought it'll give you two pieces of wood and then the tree will die so so state
2191200	2196140	save yourself a stone axe I thought the only way to pull out the trees was to do the whole eat the
2196140	2199800	fruit and use the shovel because one of the villagers taught me that trick or something you
2199800	2205760	can pull it up but if you want to destroy it you cut it down and then dig up the root mmm
2205760	2212120	interesting just like you know before and I'll tell you if you've eaten fruit and you just want
2212120	2218160	to hit a rock without destroying it keep keep a wood shovel you can no but you can also if you
2218160	2223400	eat the fruit and use the shovel on a tree you dig up the entire tree right but I'm talking about
2223400	2230080	the rocks if you're stuff out of it yeah and you've eaten fruit do not use your regular shovel
2230520	2237120	do not use it use use a wood shovel and Bobby says you can replant that tree that's what I
2237120	2242120	used to do in my old villages is I would take you can replant your rocks I would take all the the
2242120	2246160	regular trees and replace them with fruit trees but I'm not sure if that's the smartest idea now
2246160	2249680	because you actually need like wood and things like that for that come from the regular trees
2249680	2255360	so I don't know if that's the fruit trees will give you wood too oh that's good okay but still
2255400	2262520	there are so many trees in game and I actually super like them so the only one now if you hit
2262520	2268160	bamboo if you find an island with bamboo dig up your sprouts you know the little look like little
2268160	2274640	dig spots around them and whack them with the with the stone axe and you'll get two different
2274640	2280320	kinds of bamboo I don't have any crafting for them yet but you'll get different things just
2280320	2285840	stockpile and when you get your house you'll get storage and just stockpile everything don't throw
2285840	2293120	away your cans don't throw away your tires don't throw away your boots yeah you know pansy buds
2293120	2296960	right now talking about all this crafting and everything I think one thing that's important
2296960	2302200	to point out about this Animal Crossing that I think kind of makes it you know a good one is
2302200	2306360	that it's for all the criticism the Animal Crossing series gets of kind of being the same
2306360	2312040	game over and over again I think this one really took the biggest step incrementally above the last
2312040	2316560	game and I think it learned a lot from the popularity of things like Minecraft and Stardew
2316560	2321440	Valley when it comes to things like crafting when it comes to being able to have the freedom to build
2321440	2325480	things outside as well as inside I think it's kind of learned a lot from that and the game is showing
2325480	2332040	a lot of strength because of that I think yeah no I really like that I've you know I liked putting
2332040	2339080	you know bonfires outside I have my my big bonfire on one of the rocks and every time it gets
2339080	2346440	Twilight I light it and then I hear from Dan Gondor calls for aid all right anything else to
2346440	2353560	share about your gaming week Dark Saga okay Loki how about you how was your gaming week I've been
2353840	2362800	mainly playing order that's pretty much it so I'm up to 162 I think and yeah it's just been doing
2362800	2368640	lots of raids and all that fun stuff I think I played a little bit DDR earlier this week and
2368640	2375400	that's pretty much a dig animal crossing have not played it yet my kids have played it and then my
2375400	2383440	wife and my youngest son went back to play the 3ds Animal Crossing and then uh what else I've been
2383440	2389500	looking to put step mania on my arcade cabinet since our DDR machine since I've got time to do
2389500	2395120	that now and so I just was originally I wanted to create my own custom theme which I still probably
2395120	2399720	will at some point but I just want to get something working now so I picked out a theme that looks okay
2399720	2404400	and then I'm just gonna dump songs in it what but I've been fighting my computer the entire
2404400	2410000	week because it just hasn't been working and keeps crashing so I had to reload windows which
2410000	2416560	is a joy and I can't find all my step mania songs I downloaded all this stuff there's like tons of
2416560	2422840	songs somewhere on my 5 terabyte drive and I can't find them so I have to dig those up or just redownload
2422840	2429400	them because hey thank you Comcast taking away bandwidth caps right now so download away that's
2429400	2434600	pretty much it late breaking news of sorts I'm looking in our chat room over twitch TV slash
2434600	2439040	vog network and Bobby Blackwell says off topic but we just talked about this in a previous segment
2439040	2443560	Canada about 15 minutes ago just announced they're not gonna participate in the Olympics if they are
2443560	2448600	held so Canada's put their foot down and said move the damn Olympics basically and that's that
2448600	2452520	that's probably gonna do the trick is I'm sure Canada will not be the only country to put their
2452520	2458640	foot down and say move the damn Olympics you know because it's not just about the Olympics being in
2458640	2464320	this summer but it's about all the qualifiers and things that have to lead up to the Olympics
2464320	2470080	and so I think that's what the problem really ends up being is that you know we may be in a place you
2470080	2474840	know come July or whenever the August I forget when the Olympics are where it might be okay to
2474840	2480080	you know we don't have to worry as much about social distancing by then maybe but it's more
2480080	2484560	like how are they gonna run the qualifiers because that stuff happens months before you picking who
2484560	2489360	goes to the Olympics so very very interesting very interesting update and of course there's
2489360	2495920	always video game tie-ins for the Olympics so if the Olympics get pushed to 2021 you'll still have
2495920	2500480	Mario and Sonic at the Olympics 2020 out there somewhere it's very interesting are they gonna
2500480	2506920	play Mario and Sonic at the Olympics on the Ocho like they're doing today possibly possibly anyway
2506920	2514000	I also see DJ Orwell is in chat reminding us half-life Alex is out very soon in 15 hours so
2514000	2518160	I think there's gonna be a lot of people at least VR enabled people that are really looking forward
2518160	2524840	to that this week I know that's a big big game for all the talk about Doom Eternal and Animal
2524840	2528120	Crossing kind of being the big launches this weekend you know it's still within the same
2528120	2533120	seven-day period as half a new half-life game which is a really big deal as well so I'm really
2533120	2537760	looking forward to seeing what the reaction is to that and how people are enjoying that I don't
2537760	2542080	really have the VR set up to be able to enjoy it myself but I can't wait to live vicariously
2542160	2547880	through others and see if it's maybe something I need to get into for my sometimes half-life
2547880	2552720	obsessed husband we'll see I'll probably have to pick it up just to put it in my backlog to never
2552720	2558080	play like the rest of my scene games now Johnny Wolf a in chat is talking about his gaming week
2558080	2565800	consisting of doom 64 and doom eternal and I gotta say unfortunately I I picked up Animal Crossing I
2565800	2569640	did not pick up doom eternal just because I didn't really want to drop the big money on that right
2569640	2573760	now although I didn't even think to maybe go back and get doom 64 so maybe I will but I don't know
2573760	2581600	um but I was watching our pal Charles over at giant-sized team up was doing a stream the other
2581600	2587440	day of doom eternal and so I was just kind of watching him play it and it does look like fun
2587440	2594920	I got it I gotta say and I really enjoyed the doom reboot that they did in 2016 I think so like I
2594960	2601120	want to get doom at some point but I I just didn't feel the need to get it right away like I feel
2601120	2607880	like I can maybe wait till like a Black Friday sale type of situation but we'll see so but the
2607880	2612480	other thing I'll say about first-person shooters so as we get into my gaming week so a game that I
2612480	2617600	actually played this week and I swear I didn't do this just to get dark soccer to make a noise I
2617640	2626280	played Halo this week legit here's why you better be glad I'm muted here's why here's what yeah I
2626280	2631400	can't hear your eyes rolling when you're muted no but the reality is is that um speaking of doom
2631400	2639320	2016 I was on Xbox game pass because like Loki I'm thinking about oh we have all this bandwidth now
2639320	2644040	and especially you know I'm not gonna suck down all the bandwidth during the hours that people are
2644040	2649960	trying to work but on a Saturday night or something I might oh let my Xbox one run those
2649960	2656400	90 gigabytes of updates it's been needing to do for about a year now which I did let it do and I
2656400	2661240	started to kind of look around like what else can I download and doom 2016 was on Xbox game pass I
2661240	2665640	noticed and then I saw a halo the Master Chief collection that reminded me oh I have that on PC
2665640	2673160	and I think they added halo one into that on PC and sure enough they did so I played halo within
2673160	2680440	the Master Chief collection on PC thanks to game pass and yeah it looks it looks really nice and I
2680440	2684200	love playing those games with mouse and keyboard as opposed to controller I mean I like controller
2684200	2688800	but mouse and keyboard feels really good as well and I really like one thing I do really like about
2688800	2695480	halo in that collection is that all you have to do is hit the tab key and it switches between
2695480	2702000	old-school graphics and new-school graphics like without any loading time so it's really kind of
2702000	2708040	interesting to be like no filter filter no and the the difference is pretty stunning actually so
2708040	2712040	that was like a weird kind of thing I was kind of playing with and I thought was interesting taking
2712040	2717440	advantage of you know the Xbox game pass since I have that other games I've checked out this week
2717440	2722720	Animal Crossing of course I don't need to double repeat a lot of what dark soccer has said and
2722720	2727080	because I kind of inserted my own opinion while she was talking about that but I am enjoying it
2727080	2733000	I think it is a big step up compared to the previous games and I I think it's a great thing
2733000	2740680	to have come out right now like unintentionally so like with this irritated as everyone got remember
2740680	2745000	when you were all mad that Animal Crossing got delayed now it's one of those things where it's
2745000	2750280	like secretly I'm with the state of everything that's going on in the world I'm kind of glad it
2750280	2757000	happened now like we needed that game this weekend so that's really great other games
2757000	2761920	that I've been checking out this week I I randomly got back into Diablo 3 I think I talked a little
2761920	2765960	bit about that last week and I've been playing my seasonal character still continuing on in Final
2765960	2770880	Fantasy 14 because of course the game I haven't really touched this weekend which surprises me
2770880	2779640	PSO 2 is in open beta right now and I just haven't jumped on to play it yet I think because with the
2779640	2784560	closed beta it was like you have this weekend to play it and you got to get all this stuff done or
2784560	2788680	you're not gonna get your Dreamcast mag I was like oh I got a Russian and do it but now with the open
2788680	2794240	beta it's like it's running for like two weeks so I'm like oh I I don't really feel the need to rush
2794240	2798600	in there and do the open beta I'll get around to it when I get around to it so that's kind of been
2798600	2805400	my attitude with that on Xbox plus I just updated everything on my Xbox including the PSO client the
2805400	2812520	other night so that is that is something Bobby Black Wolf says I forgot to talk about PSO 2 on
2812520	2817200	my show they haven't given me my Dreamcast mag yet I don't think we were supposed to get that
2817200	2821120	until the game officially launches so I don't think that's supposed to show up until the actual
2821120	2826080	launch of the game which I still don't think they've dated actually but we'll probably know
2826080	2831480	a little more on that soon so anyway that was my gaming week let's move on and get into some of the
2831480	2837560	news what's going on in the gaming world this week so Loki you want to start us off sure so
2837560	2847280	thankfully this week we had Mark Cerny coming to us from the spaceship of love to reveal the
2847280	2857400	PlayStation 5 tech specs so I have some information on those so of course a very similar wise or spec
2857480	2864960	wise to I would say the Xbox Series X of course there were a little bit of differences and they
2864960	2872360	kind of went into some really big details regarding that some of the cool stuff that they were talking
2872360	2879400	about where the fact that with that new SSD that there's going to be very little load time talking
2879400	2884920	about how they're gonna be like deduping the data on there because originally because of the load
2884920	2889800	speeds and where you had your data on the disk it might take longer to access some of that so there
2889800	2896240	was a little bit of duplication to be able to access certain assets on there but kind of overall
2896240	2903640	you know it's gonna be an eight cores into custom CPU they're gonna have the rDNA 2 GPU as well
2903640	2910120	which is kind of similar the PlayStation 5 supposed to run at 3.5 gigahertz and then the GPU pushes a
2910240	2915960	few more teraflops of course he basically said that hey listen you know the teraflops are gonna
2915960	2920680	be a little bit different than what you might see with like an a PC or an Xbox Series X or whatever
2920680	2929440	just based on the custom architecture you know 16 gigabytes is GDDR6 and the internal storage
2929440	2935960	which is kind of weird it's kind of not really a round number but 825 gigabytes SSD it's m.2
2935960	2946720	NVMe but that is expandable with your own SSDs as well but they're gonna be benchmarking certain
2946720	2951440	ones that are gonna be compatible because of the speed of the system they need to make sure that
2951440	2957880	those SSDs are gonna be fast enough to be able to do what they needed to do for the PlayStation 5
2957880	2963360	so it was interesting very technical talk obviously something that was supposed to be done during GDC
2963360	2972240	the filming of it with the silhouette so it was a little ms3 3k but I don't know that was odd
2972240	2977960	was interesting yeah yes I kept wondering like I'm like is that like is that real or is that like
2977960	2983240	just like an animated thing it would have been funnier if they were like Sony characters like
2983240	2988640	Oh Nathan Drake is there and Kratos and why is randomly Parappa the Rappa and like all these
2988640	2994080	really odd silhouettes that would have been funny but it was supposed to be a serious talk so you
2994080	3000440	know because clearly it was their GDC talk very clearly it was very interesting to see how again
3000440	3005280	the media kind of hype things up and I'm talking you know as much as I praise and I talk about the
3005280	3011320	independent media this one's kind of on the indie media I think really read way too much into Sony's
3011320	3016720	original tweet and blog announcement because I saw these posts going around about big PlayStation
3016720	3022800	5 reveal tomorrow and you know who's most guilty of this and I'm calling you out is the youtubers
3022800	3028960	some youtubers not all youtubers but some youtubers were like all big PS 5 reveal event
3028960	3034760	predictions big games being announced tomorrow my game predictions for the PS 5 event y'all
3034760	3042200	fucked up you need to not like put your expectations on the reality of what Sony is saying
3042200	3048200	because that stuff just makes for videos I mean come on it's just it's clickbait set but yeah I
3048200	3053240	get it we all need to be like like and we need like I'm not saying we need to bully people or
3053240	3059200	but we need to say hey you made a mistake and set the expectations way too high you need to be
3059200	3063200	careful about that next time and that's all you know I'm not saying shut them down or anything
3063200	3066560	like that I'm not saying that I'm just saying like you got a little egg on your face if you
3066560	3074440	you you know if you were expecting games games games Sony never said games and y'all have to
3074440	3078900	really like and you can't and again it goes back to what we're talking about earlier in the the
3078900	3084440	show like the whole double sourcing thing if one source is telling you that fine but if if the
3084440	3089960	source says according to a PlayStation tweet that it uh which how many of those sites that post
3089960	3096200	things on Facebook how many of them are according to a tweet or according to an Instagram post
3096400	3101480	that's like so much of what we see right now right so go back and read the tweet for yourself
3101480	3107840	and see what they're really saying because that is all the article says is the 280 characters
3107840	3114680	that's in that tweet and again Sony never said anything about games and so that's why I was not
3114680	3121000	surprised whatsoever yeah I tuned into the talk and in the first 90 seconds Mark Cerny said we
3121000	3128320	have all year to show you games so we'll show you games later and so at that exactly and it was
3128320	3132520	interesting I was disappointed though because he talked about like oh yeah we're gonna have a tear
3132520	3138360	down I was like ooh tear down and then they've never did it so that was kind of point one of the
3138360	3141800	other things they kind of mentioned though because he was talking about backwards compatibility so
3141800	3145160	that is definitely gonna be a focus this time around they were even talking about like game
3145160	3151520	development wise they have the architecture for like the PlayStation 4 stuff available so that
3151520	3156480	you're gonna have a lot of games that could even be built around that kind of architecture still
3156480	3163200	on the PlayStation 5 they did promise he said that they're looking at the top most the one our most
3163200	3168040	popular PlayStation 4 games they weren't aiming to make sure that those are backwards compatible but
3168040	3172760	he says you know that we believe that the overwhelming majority of the 4,000 plus games
3172760	3180080	on PlayStation 4 will be playable on PlayStation 5 so that's pretty cool that is awesome yeah a lot
3180080	3185040	of people kind of reacted to that the thing in his talk about the 100 games but it's good to see
3185040	3188960	that and that was a good thing for Sony to kind of step in and clarify because yeah the way it was
3188960	3193520	worded in there I think a lot of people read into that that oh my gosh there's gonna be barely any
3193520	3198840	game it's gonna be like the rollout of Xbox games on Xbox 360 you remember that where it was like a
3199000	3204680	chunk of them every few months but it sounds like Sony is way ahead of that like when they put out
3204680	3209480	their clarifying statement right yeah so it should be pretty good I think Xbox is gonna be in the
3209480	3215320	same boat because they kind of I don't know I think it's gonna be very similar hardware going
3215320	3220320	into it it will be interesting to see like all this stuff that they kind of talked about during
3220320	3225840	this presentation how that's gonna make a difference and I mean it could make a difference at the end
3225880	3231680	of the day it's gonna be the games so be just how these different developers utilize the hardware
3231680	3235880	that they have this is definitely laying the foundation for that because now when they have
3235880	3240080	their next thing they can talk a little more about games I mean it doesn't necessarily have to be
3240080	3245600	their next thing but on down the road they can really focus on having an announcement that's
3245600	3253400	just about the games you know one thing we should talk about with that GDC talk essentially that was
3253400	3258160	repurposed for YouTube that Sony did we need to talk about Mark Cerny himself for a little bit
3258160	3262480	because I know there were a lot of people on Twitter that were poking fun at him a little
3262480	3266760	bit because he has a lot of mannerisms very similar to Dana Carvey he's very soft-spoken
3266760	3272040	and so forth and so some people were kind of poking fun at that and so forth but um y'all
3272040	3277920	better not forget and I forgot this until someone pointed it out on our discord that badass mother
3277920	3288120	fucker Mark Cerny made marble madness when he was like 17 or 18 so don't you forget it so when
3288120	3293000	you're teasing him saying he's like you know Dana Carvey's impressions or something don't forget he
3293000	3297360	made marble madness which is one of the like that was that was one of the all-time most creative
3297360	3306440	original arcade games it was a badass NES game as well so well where's my ray traced marble game
3306840	3312440	for PlayStation 5 hey you never know you never know he's he's also contributed to other games
3312440	3316680	and so forth but that was just like when somebody pointed that out and you kind of go look at the
3316680	3321600	dude's resume it's like dang this guy made some big contributions to gaming and ended up kind of
3321600	3326760	going to work for Sony on the hardware side like this guy like knows what he's doing because he's
3326760	3332880	been in there programming games and so forth for a very long time and do it doing some of the
3332920	3339880	all-time great games for sure Tiger Claw and chat says if they make a movie about Mark Cerny Dana
3339880	3346320	Carvey should totally play him okay that I will allow that I will allow but let us let us not
3346320	3351800	underestimate how powerful Mark Cerny is as some of his contributions to gaming all right anyway
3351800	3356560	let's move on and talk a little bit about what happened in Nintendo's world this week Nintendo
3356560	3361680	had an indie event so they did one of their indie directs or the indie world showcase if you will
3361680	3365680	where they showed off some of the indie games that are coming to switch over the next couple
3365680	3372600	months or things that were coming out today like exit the Gungeon now I think we knew this game was
3372600	3376320	coming I want to say we had heard about this before but we didn't know it was gonna be the
3376320	3382880	surprise drop on us as of today so exit there as of the day of the the event so exit the Gungeon
3382880	3388840	another bullet-hell dungeon climber but it is following the events of enter the Gungeon so
3388840	3393320	that's pretty cool Loki I don't know if you've had a chance to check out exit the Gungeon yet
3393320	3398840	but I know you were a big fan of enter the Gungeon right I have not checked it out I think it was out
3398840	3405960	on Apple Arcade already and then they're just porting it over to switch I don't know if it's
3405960	3413760	out on PC that's right I think you're right about Apple Arcade yeah now another you know I gotta say
3413760	3417640	there weren't a lot of like indie titles that we knew a lot about there weren't a lot of like big
3417680	3422560	names that were really jumping out but I mean they're Indies so sometimes you don't know that
3422560	3428400	an indie game is gonna really take over like you know Minecraft, Crypt of the Necrodancer,
3428400	3434600	Five Nights at Freddy's they were all indie games too but I thought this was very interesting is
3434600	3440480	that one of the game creators that showed up during this event was Hello Games and their
3440480	3446520	contribution is a game called The Last Campfire Hello Games if you will recall is the studio
3446600	3453760	behind No Man's Sky so it is kind of interesting after everything that that game No Man's Sky went
3453760	3458880	through being a hugely hyped launch on the PlayStation 4 when essentially it was kind of
3458880	3466240	an indie title they got a lot of AAA promotion treatment and so forth and then we saw how that
3466240	3470400	went for them when the game first came out but again and I said this before if you haven't
3470400	3475640	touched No Man's Sky since it first came out it's a completely different game now very similar to
3475800	3481440	what Diablo 3 went through Final Fantasy 14 or Destiny 2 you know one of those games has been
3481440	3488360	really transformed No Man's Sky is right up there so I think a lot of people were kind of wondering
3488360	3493640	ooh what big sci-fi thing might Hello Games do next but it is interesting to note that now this
3493640	3500760	indie studio Hello Games is doing an indie game but I'm looking forward to it because I love No
3500760	3507720	Man's Sky so I'm curious to see what they do their game is called The Last Campfire and it's
3507720	3512520	about a wilderness where there are strange creatures mysterious ruins and you are trying
3512520	3518080	to light the last campfire it's a tale of magic and mystery and it's coming out for the Nintendo
3518080	3521960	Switch this summer so some that was kind of the biggest surprise for me out of this was like oh
3521960	3527080	Hello Games ready to show what they're working on next and it's a little bit more of a scaled back
3527080	3531000	if you will indie title so I'm really excited to check that out on some other things that were
3531000	3538040	announced at the Nintendo indie event Blue Fire from Robie Studios Baldo from Naps Team I Am Dead
3538040	3544400	from Hollow Ponds which I was kind of like ooh I don't know if this is the most well-timed game
3544400	3549040	announcement with all that's going on in the world but it does look like an interesting puzzle
3549040	3555880	adventure game and so forth so that's that a game called Bee Ark or Bark where pugs cats bears and
3555880	3562320	bunnies save the solar system sign me the fuck up that sounds awesome and I love the name Bee Ark
3562320	3569960	bark cyanide and happiness Freakpocalypse part one so I'm assuming that's based on the comic
3569960	3575640	so I love that series so I have to play it yeah so I'm sure yeah some folks will be really excited
3575640	3582400	about that Summer in Mara from Chibig Quantum League from Nimble Giant Entertainment The Good
3582440	3590560	Life from White Owls Inc pixel junk eat pixel junk Eden 2 from Q games Feria from abracam hope
3590560	3596760	I said that right eldest souls from fallen flag studio moving out from SMG studio and sky racket
3596760	3605380	from double dash studios all of that coming out in the next either some of them came out that sky
3605380	3608960	racket actually just came out this week some of those other titles coming up throughout the
3608960	3613800	summer and so forth there's some other titles in there as well apparently Blair Witch from
3613800	3618560	bluebird another Blair Witch game from bluebird team coming out as well and so on many many more
3618560	3626120	and they also announced a new indie focus Twitter account that's pretty cool at indie world and a
3626120	3633000	IND IE world and a so pretty cool hopefully some of you guys looking to check out some of those
3633000	3638120	games quest buster and chat says exit the gungeon just came out but I don't think it's as well
3638120	3644200	received you know it's it it's a orange right says Oh exit the gungeon did seem familiar like
3644200	3650160	it was already announced I guess that's it yeah um it's you know and especially right now in the
3650160	3654480	world a lot of these games are kind of struggling to get noticed amongst everything else going on
3654480	3661240	but I think as this new normal and I'm using my quote II fingers because it's hard to think of
3661240	3666120	this as normal but for the next eight to ten weeks or whatever it might be as this new normal kind of
3666120	3671880	settles in I think we'll kind of get used to these sorts of announcements and things so anyway
3671880	3677560	a different way of doing things moving on Dark Sakura of course you're gonna have an Animal
3677560	3686680	Crossing story right yeah I was actually a little surprised but uh there is a and I might have
3686680	3695800	talked about her before it was this 87 year old lady who had a 3500 plus hour Animal Crossing
3695800	3703960	town her grandson Paul posted this pic this video of her her name is Audrey she's showing off her
3703960	3710800	progress on the 3ds game on you leave she'd been playing every day for four years and of course
3710880	3718440	everyone loves her because she is everyone's Animal Crossing grandmother so it looks like
3718440	3728080	that they based a character in New Horizons off of her Audrey's nickname is Adi and so there's a
3728080	3735720	character in the game now called Adi who wears a cute little blue dress and shades and she's a
3735720	3744040	one of the foxy ones and looks like that's a tribute to this gaming grandmother I love
3744040	3750200	that props to Nintendo for doing that and maybe the little win games do that me too and you know
3750200	3755280	you got to respect your gaming grandmas keep in mind we're all self isolating right now so that
3755280	3760760	our gaming grandmas don't get sick you know it's a big it's a big part of it so has precious it must
3760760	3765920	be protected that's right she's precious do it hashtag do it for Audrey hashtag do it for Betty
3765920	3772880	White honestly we got any whites immortal we got to save the elderly you guys well did you see the
3772880	3784360	PSA that went out by Max Brooks Mel Brooks's son who oh yeah I did see that he's like if he gets
3784360	3793560	sick then Dick Van Dyke and all these others and I was like yeah let's let's be nice and Bobby is
3793560	3798520	pointing out this whole thing is the localization team which I know sometimes localization team that
3798520	3803760	sneaks these types of things in here the Japanese name was something not directly translatable so
3803760	3808840	the US team named her Adi so that's a lot of the Japanese names are nothing that's directly
3808840	3816360	translatable yeah but I do like when there are nods to them like I hadn't seen captain but he
3816360	3826320	was clearly a kappa and Tom Nook would be for a tanuki yeah and just to make sure I didn't
3826320	3831280	misrepresent anything I want to make sure I'm very clear kovat does not only attack the elder
3831280	3835760	elderly they are the most vulnerable but we are self isolating to keep each other healthy as well
3835760	3842080	because this can affect folks in their 40s like me 30s 50s you know we're doing it for each other
3842080	3849200	yeah I can absolutely big batch of people younger and that's why even if you know if it's just
3849200	3856440	pneumonia for me I still can't leave the house oh yeah because secondary infections are really
3856440	3861640	really bad news with that stuff absolutely it was kind of the other way around to remember when you
3861640	3865840	and I had swine flu all those years ago it seems like it was such a memory fucking no I had swine
3865840	3870240	flu yeah we didn't know till after that and and not to compare the two because these are very very
3870240	3875840	different things but the thing was swine flu and when even after I was diagnosed I felt fine I
3875840	3883280	still had to stay home for a week my doctor put me in quarantine for a week because I couldn't catch
3883280	3888240	anything secondary in the whole time and it was the whole time I thought oh she's isolating me she
3888280	3891800	doesn't want me to give it to my class because I was a corporate trainer at the time and I had a
3891800	3897680	class of 30 people no she didn't want the class getting me sick again because that was the
3897680	3903080	dangerous part and I think some of that is in play with kovat but again I don't I'm not a doctor
3903080	3909720	I don't misrepresent anything you don't want it it's not just the flu don't get it if you can
3910040	3916320	if you'll remember after I had swine flu I developed a nasty sinus infection and bronchitis
3916320	3925680	yeah remember I do so if I had known that I had that I would have stayed inside and not gone to
3925680	3933520	eat delicious matzo ball soup that made me feel better all right yeah back to all this we need to
3933520	3941440	protect our gaming grandmothers and the ones that we love and and honestly for everyone who's saying
3941440	3948440	boomer remover I wish you would seriously shut the fuck up these are our parents yeah that's all
3948440	3954960	and it's if you think this thing only targets based on age you need to like read a newspaper
3954960	3961440	or like just literally listen to anything going on right now because we just had an a report of
3961440	3967080	somebody in their 30s in the Hollywood area who went to Disney World you know not again that's
3967080	3970280	the that's the dangerous thing about this like you might go oh my god why did he go to Disney
3970280	3975360	World because he wasn't he didn't he didn't feel sick he didn't look sick he would but he had it
3975360	3979440	and because this thing has an incubation period of 14 days he didn't know and he ended up passing
3979440	3985400	away from it it's really tragic so and I'll just tell people even it this is my last time even if
3985400	3991440	you're not under shelter in place even if you're just only in social distancing please act like
3991440	3998920	you are under shelter in place please you will you'll be doing your part you'll be preventing
3998920	4003680	the spread I'm really surprised that bigger metropolitan areas there are still places in
4003680	4011120	this country that haven't enacted it don't go out like to buy planters or a video game in public or
4011120	4021280	you know don't don't go to a bar or any of that the more you expose yourself the more other people
4021280	4026720	and Bobby Bobby black wolf is saying in chat too late because he openly admitted he went out and
4026720	4032000	got a video game this week but admittedly this is also a situation that's changing day by day like
4032000	4036840	the day you win it like even the night you went out to get the game things did not feel as dire
4036840	4041600	as they are day by day I was we're hearing more and more about like what this thing is really
4041600	4048000	doing so like you know we all probably thought we could take it a little bit lighter than it
4048000	4054080	really is at some point early on I'm sure we've all been guilty of that a little bit but yeah heck
4054080	4059280	I still went on my cruise you know what and I don't know luckily nobody on the shit you know
4059280	4064440	it's today is 14 days since the cruise and there's been no reports of COVID from the cruise so it was
4064440	4068920	everything was fine and dandy and so forth but I certainly make no apologies for that but you
4068920	4075520	know if that cruise had been just a week and a half later I don't think I would have gone so
4075520	4080480	you know timing is really everything really really everything but honestly those airports were way
4080480	4085960	more filthy than the boat was just saying yeah who has that you know who has bad timing hmm my
4085960	4090720	husband for vacuuming while I can hear it through the door well we don't we don't hear it through
4090720	4097480	the on the station for what it's worth so all right anyhow let us move on Loki I think you're
4097480	4105160	next yes that's true so we kind of knew this was gonna happen considering that a Sony made
4105160	4110080	the announcement last week or a medium alcohol I can't remember who was it you'd be able to soon
4110080	4118440	sell some of your creations that you make in dreams well you know all the videos I've seen
4118440	4123680	of dreams online have all benches recreations of other games or like all sorts of copyright
4123680	4129520	infringement stuff so of course there's a lot of Mario games out there and one of the creators
4129520	4138880	goes by the name of piece of craft he had made a Mario game in dreams as well and he's received
4138880	4145960	a copyright strike on the model which basically disallows that game that he made to be played by
4145960	4150440	others in dreams and so the similar type of stuff is happening with some of these other
4150440	4156880	creations that utilize the models similar to that so definitely Nintendo is taking notice of these
4156880	4162480	Mario games that people are making in dreams so you're probably not going to be able to utilize
4162480	4167800	a lot of those copyright materials I would assume that more this would happen with some of the other
4167800	4173320	creations out there because I've seen all sorts of mix-ups with like spongebob and Shrek and all
4173360	4177600	the memes I mean it's really everything it's interesting you kind of talk about that because
4177600	4181200	and even Bobby's alluding to this in our chat right now over at twitch TV slash vog network
4181200	4185680	we're Bobby saying that's because the youtubers only focus on these creations there's a lot more
4185680	4191280	than that in a game and that's very true is that you know again it it gets more eyes and clicks
4191280	4196040	and things when it's like lol it's a spongebob meme inside dreams you know that type of thing
4196040	4201280	gets more clicks than hey here's this person's totally original presentation and how cool it is
4201280	4206160	heck I'm guilty of this as well when the very first little big planet game came out the very
4206160	4211720	first one what did I say was my favorite level the shrine to Parker Posey level is still to this
4211720	4216560	day my favorite thing I've ever seen in little big planet but it was kind of okay like it's
4216560	4221760	like ripping off all these publicity photos of her and things like that I'd like to think at
4221760	4226360	the time it was still kind of a new and novel thing but yeah I mean we got to realize that
4226600	4235160	dreams has a lot more in it than just the copyright stuff but that's the stuff that gets people's
4235160	4241640	attention when it's like oh somebody recreated doom inside dreams what like that gets people's
4241640	4246200	attention whereas you know yeah yeah I mean it's just amazing what you can do with the gaming yeah
4246200	4252200	I know there's a lot of other stuff out there but and hopefully you know that this will they'll go
4252200	4258120	through this and it was just be removed although I mean that's not to say that it made stuff will
4258120	4264000	slip through I mean already the one of the other games that the guy made which was mario 64 HD in
4264000	4270920	dreams is still available to play without the model I guess and I know other games like roblox
4270920	4275640	and stuff like that I mean that's been around forever and there's all sorts of copyright
4275640	4280840	infringement stuff in there like I see my kids playing that and I'm just like how is that allowed
4280840	4287760	it's just it's people catching it so I'm sure this will be the end of it but at least people
4287760	4292560	can know that they are looking for it now and you know we've kind of talked about this phenomenon on
4292560	4297400	the show over the years many times you know whenever you have a game creation software
4297400	4301480	type of thing how long is and this we talked about this a little big planet first came out
4301480	4306480	we talked about this when Mario maker came out how long is it until someone recreates world one
4306480	4312640	one from Super Mario Brothers how long because I mean world one one is iconic because it's
4312640	4320160	something that you recognize just based on that little formula of you know the little the line
4320160	4324040	here and I'm using my I'm making motions for those that are on the podcast and where those
4324040	4329600	question mark blocks are located so I mean that that's level design games so strong in world one
4329600	4335120	one that like you recognize that even when it's being copied in other games just interesting so
4335120	4343560	one of those types of phenomenons so anyway alright um let's move on and talk about a game
4343560	4348840	that valve put out a little while ago called artifact and I think valve actually didn't valve
4348840	4353840	pull this game at some point or they they way scale back on artifact but apparently it may be
4353840	4359440	coming back because dota twos it was a dota 2 based game called artifact it's kind of it's
4359440	4363720	basically their version of hearthstone I mean I know I'm not supposed to say that but you know
4363720	4367880	let's be real hearthstone caught a lot of eyes a lot of people wanted a piece of the pot with
4367880	4373720	that valves one of them so artifact was kind of their response to that but they aren't updating
4373720	4378720	it anymore now okay so the game isn't dead it was the updates that they stopped doing sorry I will
4378720	4384880	I haven't been following the game myself personally but that's what's going on however edge magazine
4384880	4390920	has some inside sources that are saying valve is working on a follow-up internally it's being
4390920	4395360	called artifact tube that doesn't necessarily mean that's what it is could be an expansion could be
4395360	4400160	a new game could be something you know it could be anything Gabe Newell once referred to artifact
4400160	4405640	as an interesting failure they thought it was a strong product saying quote we ran an experiment
4405640	4409400	we got a negative result and now we need to see if we've learned anything from that so let's try
4409400	4414280	again and that's what the artifact team has been doing and what they're getting ready to release
4414280	4419080	based on the reaction to it what was wrong with the product how do we get there let's fix those
4419120	4424000	things and take another run at it of course no information on when that updates gonna come out
4424000	4430960	or the sequel or anything like that but they do say that more details will come out after half
4430960	4437520	life Alex launches which understandable valve is very focused on the half-life Alex thing right now
4437520	4443160	so we'll know a little more information about whatever this artifact thing is at a later date
4443160	4448360	and if half-life Alex is successful then that gets more eyes on steam and a great place for them to
4448360	4453320	announce some more information about artifact whatever the future is for that so fifth dream
4453320	4459760	today in our chat says Wow cards dota cards low cards League of Legends cars guys come on well
4459760	4465200	it's you know and it doesn't stop there Elder Scrolls had their own game The Witcher did Gwent
4465200	4473400	as a standalone game you know a game when a game is extraordinarily popular like Hearthstone or if
4473400	4477960	you want to like Magic the Gathering and all the Magic the Gathering games on the computer everybody
4478120	4481960	wants a piece of that somehow how can we make a trading card game where we're not copying it
4481960	4487600	we're kind of putting our own spin on it and doing so I think that's one thing that everybody
4487600	4494080	wants a piece of I will say for what it's worth I think when a Hearthstone strengths is that it's
4494080	4500720	very simplistic it's not a particularly difficult game to teach and I think the fact that Hearthstone
4500720	4509360	runs cross-platform very easily between tablets and phones completely agnostic a platform doesn't
4509360	4518280	matter if you're Apple Android what have you it sinks sinks that with PC so well I think that's a
4518280	4524040	huge asset for it that I'm not sure all of the other games have been able to copy as well so
4524040	4530200	food for thought anyway fifth dream today follows up and says I'm friends with people very involved
4530200	4534200	in some of the car games online like they work for the companies and streamers and wow it all
4534200	4539400	goes right over my head hype mayhem says to be honest I'm good with car games at the moment I'm
4539400	4543320	happy just playing my Magic the Gathering games on Steam yeah it's something it's like me and MMOs
4543320	4548480	it's hard to play more than one quest buster says honestly surprised that artifact is getting a
4548480	4553800	second pass especially after what its twitch channel turned into but gotta give valve credit
4553800	4560000	for trying well they believe in it and you know games it's not unheard of for games to get rebooted
4560200	4565920	successfully again Diablo 3 no man's sky we've gone down this road a million times this is what
4565920	4572760	happens with games now in this year 2020 so we'll see if valve has any luck with that meanwhile Dark
4572760	4581000	Sakura what else do we have we have me trying to unmute my mic that's one of them no it's taking
4581000	4587320	some getting used to this new setup oh I hate this the site started playing everything automatically
4587320	4591720	it's not streaming through is it no we can't hear it we're only we're only hearing you well
4591720	4598040	it's playing I can't hear it just we're just hearing you we don't hear okay well it's bothering
4598040	4603320	me so I'll go ahead and try to read this while this is playing in the background oh there we go
4603320	4609680	sorry I found it I can't do both sounds at the same time it messes up my brain no you're fine
4609680	4614360	I don't know if Safari is like Chrome but there's like that using Safari I'm on a PC right now oh
4614720	4621000	because Chrome has a little speaker icon you can click it and it'll shut shut it up yeah this it
4621000	4629600	doesn't do it for everything at any well done I have four browser windows open so at any rate
4629600	4638800	it was announced for the World Video Game Hall of Fame that they have their finalists up and ready
4638800	4646840	to go I have already done my voting so the games that are on the list this year are Bejeweled,
4646840	4656600	Centipede, Frogger, Goldeneye 007, Guitar Hero, King's Quest, Minecraft, NBA Jam, Nokia Snake,
4656600	4662360	Super Smash Brothers Melee, Uncharted 2 Among Thieves, and where in the world is Carmen Sand
4662360	4668400	Diego you don't know what I voted for can you only vote for one in that list I think you can
4668520	4674200	go back and vote but I just voted for one which one did you vote for where in the world is Carmen
4674200	4684240	Sand Diego that's a good one if I were to vote in that poll ooh that's a tricky one Bejeweled,
4684240	4688400	Centipede, Frogger, Goldeneye, Guitar Hero, King's Quest, Minecraft, NBA Jam, Nokia Snake,
4688400	4692480	Super Smash Brothers, Uncharted, and where in the world is Carmen Sand Diego I would be very
4692480	4697880	tempted to vote for Nokia Snake but I think I would give it to King's Quest I think I'd have
4697880	4702080	to give it to King's Quest that was that whole Sierra I mean cuz King's Quest to me is
4702080	4708040	representative of the 90s Sierra PC era which and I'm sure Bobby Black Wolf is nodding his head and
4708040	4713640	there's many of you out there that are gonna be nodding your head those games were like formative
4713640	4717880	games for me and the contributions that Roberta Williams and you know everybody that worked on
4717880	4722800	those games is Sierra and so even Leisure Suit Larry Teehee you know though all of that stuff
4722800	4727480	was so important to my childhood that like I have to give it to King's Quest for sure and
4727600	4731840	Carmen Sandiego had a bigger impact on mine I didn't really enjoy the King's Quest games the
4731840	4739360	only real big game on those lines that I played a significant amount of was Luma yeah and you know
4739360	4744920	I it's again it's not a it's not a diss on where in the world is Carmen Sandiego like that game was
4744920	4751720	certainly important too but just for me I put King's Quest ahead of it Loki what about you from
4751720	4754880	that list what would you what game would you vote for to go in the Hall of Fame on that list
4754880	4769040	that's the time I didn't like King's Quest one too much I guess I would say Minecraft or Carmen
4769040	4778360	Sandiego okay I can see my craft but at any rate the voting is going to be going on through the
4778360	4785840	online ballot on April 2nd and I will find the link to post in chat right now but if you go to
4785840	4793440	World Video Game Hall of Fame org that's where everything is listed see and they do have some
4793440	4802480	write-in places as well oh that's good I'm with Bobby I'm more of a Space Quest guy fair enough
4802480	4808080	and a one question about Minecraft if that were to win who gets to accept the award Microsoft or
4808200	4818040	that other guy I would hope the developer well notch is it yeah but I I don't need to hear him
4818040	4825200	give a speech so yeah but it was his creation yeah but I I think I'm fully admitting some of that you
4825200	4829040	know what the Oscars are politics too I suppose in a way but some of that would weigh into my
4829040	4834920	decision on why I wouldn't want to see minecraft get it well they still have a development team I
4835000	4843080	mean that's the folks that should be getting it so also for me it's not that minecraft is minecraft
4843080	4847080	also a little new for me I know it seems really weird to say but I just feel like some of these
4847080	4851160	other games on the list have more of a legacy and we have yet to see what minecraft's legacy
4851160	4856160	is truly going to be we're still like I feel like minecraft is still still a game that is being
4856160	4862400	developed where's that where's that super 4k pack but anyway minecraft is still a game that's on
4862400	4869480	it's never happening never King's Quest 1 is done Carmen San Diego is done sure there's new Carmen
4869480	4873120	San Diego games there might be a new King's Quest games on it but those games essentially are done
4873120	4878320	so that's another thing that really weighs in for me so I mean be mad if you want I'm just telling
4878320	4886600	it like it is so there you go all right anyway let's move on let's talk about the next story
4886600	4894200	which I think Loki is yours so this is kind of fun since everybody's doing those wonderful directs
4894200	4901600	now so humble bundle is gonna be joining the party with their brand new series called the humble brag
4901600	4908400	it's where they're gonna be talking about games and I guess showing some different I don't know
4908400	4912680	deals that they're gonna be doing some of the stuff they're gonna be talking about courses
4912680	4918200	including their own releases because remember they are publishing some games now like them's
4918200	4927320	fighting herds and Temtem the first one's gonna take place on March 24th it looks like at 11 p.m.
4927320	4938800	Pacific Time and March 25th at 2 p.m. Eastern Time so and those are kind of some weird weird times to
4938800	4946600	put those live but I guess we'll have to see more about what this is all about I mean I don't know
4946600	4952960	I don't really have high expectations but neat they might have they might have secured some more
4952960	4956880	like indie stuff because like you said they're doing publishing now which I totally forgot that
4956880	4961400	that was the thing but the them fighting herds that's that one's kind of a big deal that's the
4961400	4968120	one that's like it's my little pony but it's not wink right right and that just came out of early
4968120	4975160	access that's the skull girls folks made that game right or am I crazy I don't remember who
4975160	4981560	made that okay I just know I just know there was a lot of like pony fandom mixed with like school
4981560	4987840	girls mixed with that so somebody in chat maybe can explain the difference to me but I just that
4987840	4992440	oh thank you DJ Rama S it used the school girls engine that's okay I knew there was a tie to
4992440	4996600	school girls in there somehow but it was an independent company okay thank you so I knew
4996600	5000760	there was a tie-in somewhere there they that's why I love doing this with a live chat room because
5000760	5005560	you guys can course correct me when I'm I'm like I remember some of the details but not all of them
5005560	5010800	because an awful lot happens in gaming so all right all right well we'll see what comes through
5010800	5018240	with the humble humble brags I love that name yeah so they're saying though okay so they had
5018240	5025920	a few different dates for the the humble brag presentations although the actual tweet those
5025960	5031640	mentions March 24th at 9 a.m. Pacific time which sends more reasonable I'm not sure why they said
5031640	5037280	there's bring a humble brag presentation will go live and then they have this like long day range
5037280	5042920	so I would say March 24th 9 a.m. Pacific time okay we'll see what they have to announce I guess
5042920	5046640	we'll have something to talk about on next week's show regarding all this all right well meanwhile
5046640	5049960	before we get to the classic game of the week talking about some things you can do right now
5049960	5055160	I mentioned earlier in the show I was using Xbox game pass to check out like Halo and stuff this
5055160	5060800	week and I'm sure some of you guys are using your suddenly open bandwidth connections to download a
5060800	5065120	lot of stuff that you're a little bit behind on well apparently now Xbox game pass ultimate will
5065120	5070080	include bonuses like content in the games themselves and I saw some of this as I was
5070080	5076280	browsing this week they're called perks and some of the initial extras involve cosmetics and
5076280	5081760	characters they're saying a gold ticket mission pass and fantasy star online too I didn't see that
5081760	5085480	though when I went in to look at the perks but maybe that's not gonna happen till the game
5085480	5090920	launches I don't know I did see the ship ornaments in Sea of Thieves and the gods and smite I saw
5090920	5095640	some of that you don't have to do anything extra to enable the perks you just get them through Xbox
5095640	5101280	one or you get them through the beta app on Windows 10 or the mobile app so plenty of ways to get
5101280	5107360	those perks not surprising to hear about that at all that's very similar to what PlayStation Plus
5107360	5112560	has because they have some perks with games as well like I've seen like apex legends stuff and
5112560	5118600	things to tie into PlayStation Plus so it's not too surprising to see Microsoft get on on that
5118600	5123120	too except instead of putting it at the Xbox gold level they're putting it at the game pass level
5123120	5128240	but I think we're all sitting here going it's really just a matter of time before they fuse
5128240	5135480	Xbox gold and Xbox game pass together I think that's coming it's just a matter of when because
5135800	5140400	certainly if you want to buy both and I think the game pass ultimate is both those things
5140400	5148120	combined so a lot of people are getting in on that so anyway there you go let's take a trip
5148120	5153600	down memory lane before you could actually download all these special things you had to
5153600	5158600	have a cartridge if you wanted to play something taking a trip down memory lane every week Dark
5158600	5162760	Sakura steps in the vault and finds a game that she thinks hey you should be checking out this
5162760	5167080	game this week Dark Sakura what is the classic game of the week that you picked for us this week
5167080	5175320	I picked a stinker I picked a bad one I picked safe clued in sets pretty fighter and specifically
5175320	5187800	this one is on the Super Famicom it is a fighting game from 1984 published by imagineer and it is of
5187800	5194760	course a one or two player game it does not go for very much if you find one but it is novel
5194760	5202600	it even did get a sequel called pretty fighter X at some point but basically with this game you
5202600	5210920	are different characters who have different uniforms with a different color and they they
5210920	5217960	have some salacious like content but nothing like cornish you know it's like fanboy service you know
5217960	5228480	but the original game the one on Super Famicom had different characters eight of them that had
5228480	5235840	their family name contained something specific for the color that represented them so we had
5235840	5246280	Aoki Marin was a schoolgirl that wore Pina Blue and she's the main character of the series there's
5246280	5256960	a Shiratori Kris who is a nurse her color is white a Saksa Judy who is a friend of Marin's and she
5256960	5267280	moonlights his athletic dancer and her color is red for Akka there's Kono Keiko who fights an officer here her color is
5267280	5274240	navy blue Kiyori Yoko who is a college student who just wears you know traditional clothing her color
5274240	5281120	is yellow you know kimono by traditional is what I meant Midori Kawa Minami who is a private school
5281120	5290000	girl and wears green Momoyama Ai is a gymnast wears like gymnastics outfit her color is pink
5290000	5301720	Zen Momo like peach and Yamaguki Yawara is a judo wrestler and she wears golden yellow so the game
5301720	5311200	believe it or not it's not like the worst I have played many many bad fighting games in my time it
5311200	5319480	actually is graphically pretty good it the characters are well designed I think the concepts are great
5319480	5327080	it's it's the thing about it being terrible it's really average and when something is average we
5327080	5339040	call it terrible as far as the other ones or you know I don't think that pretty fighter X was that
5339040	5349000	much better I actually have pretty fighter X I I had played it so long ago but yeah it's uh it's
5349000	5353760	pretty average I'm just gonna say that it's I think it's worth everyone playing at least once
5353760	5363640	and you've got some different interesting things like for example you have throws for your
5363640	5370400	characters but you can't throw blocking the hit detection is kind of meh you know sometimes your
5370400	5376960	projectiles won't hit depending on what's going on and you can you know corner block somebody just
5376960	5384240	trap them but it's it's average the characters are decently designed you know if a little
5384240	5392400	stereotypical but it's worth mentioning because I mean this is one of the early all-female fighting
5392400	5400240	games I mean we had the Asuka series you know like Asuka 120% I've done before is a classic game and
5400240	5407720	gals fighter for Neo Geo pocket color so just throwing it out there this could have been one
5407720	5416800	of our originators yeah some people have said it's a very much like some of the Sailor Moon
5416800	5421200	games from the same era well yeah this this particular fighter we're looking at in the video
5421200	5425720	on Twitch right now just straight-up looks like Sailor Moon like it's very interesting well I'm
5425720	5433480	looking up Imagineer to see what else they did the other website is down well and I think it's
5433480	5436880	also just you know even though you kind of highlight this classic game is it's kind of
5436880	5442320	average I think it's still worth noting that you know this comes from an era when everybody was
5442320	5446680	trying to copy Street Fighter you know Street Fighter 2 specifically you know Street Fighter
5446680	5451440	2 was such a huge game especially when it released on the Super Nintendo that literally everybody was
5451440	5455560	trying to copy it and of course there was the whole fighting street or whatever it was called
5456200	5462680	literally copying it in some ways but you know other types of clones came out and sometimes you
5462680	5469240	know it was like okay make it Street Fighter 2 but like make it for horny boys and that's what
5469240	5477240	this is. I knew the Sailor Moon S game that I had was better than this because it was done by
5477240	5484120	Arc System. I wish I hadn't sold that game it was kind of fun because it had the chibi mood
5484440	5488720	butt smash. I feel like you highlighted that on a previous episode at some point I'm sure you have.
5488720	5495200	But I was like I'm pretty sure that Imagineer didn't do it yeah it was Arc System. And this
5495200	5500600	again coming out of Japan like I remember playing a Dragon Ball Z game I remember playing a Ranma
5500600	5505520	game where I'm a one-half game I remember playing like everybody had to have a fighting game in in
5505520	5513720	this certain like 1991 1992 era like on the Super Nintendo was crazy. But at any rate if you want
5514360	5520280	average then you're gonna try it and it's cheap you know if you're looking for just something
5520280	5525800	that's a little weird but easy to play or if you're just or if you're just horny for waifu fighting
5525800	5532280	there you go yeah waifu fighting yeah get your waifu fight on. I took that from uh victory today
5532280	5538280	all in on waifu dead with legs up yeah it's uh really it's it's ridiculous like charming it's
5538280	5544520	if or you could just recognize how ridiculous stupid something like this is like you know it's
5544520	5550200	like sometimes you just want to watch a bad movie right like sometimes I want to invite Dark Sakura
5550200	5555720	over so we can watch Showgirls and make fun of it because it's a terrible movie and sometimes
5555720	5564280	we want to just play Pretty Fighter because it's stupid right yeah yeah hold on I'm double checking
5564280	5572920	that yeah developer Sailor Moon asks developer Arc System Works publisher Angel Bandai so it
5572920	5579400	was published by Bandai and developed by Arc System there we go all right bam all right there
5579400	5584040	it is your classic game of the week Pretty Fighter for short um what was the full name again Dark
5584040	5591320	Sakura I missed the full name uh fuck let me get it again pretty fighter no I'll get it hold on it
5591320	5601080	is um uh uh pretty fighter as in school uniform legend of course but I noticed even in the the
5601080	5606840	stripper stage with the gargoyles yes podcast folks that was a real thing we just saw on twitch
5606840	5612040	uh you could see in the background the neon sign said pretty fighter in the back so I guess that's
5612040	5617400	the that's the code name that game's adopted so all right not every game is a winner but we
5617400	5622040	highlight uh the games you should check out just because they have a place in gaming history even
5622040	5626440	if it's the not so great part of history all right it was worth a mention it was worth a mention all
5626440	5631320	right uh until our next segment let's move or until our next classic game segment let's move
5631320	5635480	on with this week's show and some of the other segments we have for tonight how's how's my co-host
5635480	5640040	Captain Pikachu doing tonight you doing you doing good you hanging in there all right good all right
5640040	5646920	let's move on it's it's very boring in this giant room with nobody else but this camera
5648120	5652440	it's it's the journey of one man going slowly insane while we watch tonight's program
5653160	5657320	all right well y'all on discord help keep me company let's get to some rapid fire news
5659560	5667080	all right so uh this is the most important feature that's being added to no man's sky
5667080	5672440	and that is bobbleheads that's right so they're going to be adding some bobbleheads
5672520	5678200	into the next update here so we've got uh two they're sold by the quicksilver bot
5678200	5684520	uh the first one being it looks like the specialist polo and then priest entity nada
5684520	5688280	are going to be the two that are going to be starting the game they're going to have
5688280	5693400	some new ones created later on but those will be the two that you'll start off with so that's
5693400	5697560	pretty awesome and even have like this cool little video showing it bobbling as you take off
5697720	5703000	uh the other thing is because you know we're under this whole uh covid 19 situation one of
5703000	5708600	the things that's been affected by that of course is movie theaters and you've seen a lot of these
5708600	5715560	different movies that were just literally released in theaters now coming out um on streaming
5715560	5721880	services so one of these movies that uh came out not too long ago sonic the hedgehog is actually
5722840	5727000	that uh came out not too long ago sonic the hedgehog is actually going to be released on
5727000	5733880	the 31st of march so you can actually stream it to your house for 20 bucks um so that's pretty
5733880	5737240	cool and i know robbie haven't gotten a chance to see the movie is this something that you'd be
5737240	5741880	interested in watching um yeah i want to see it at some point but 20 bucks is a little high for me i
5741880	5745560	mean that is the price of let's say like two movie tickets or i guess in this day and age one and a
5745560	5749800	half movie tickets so the 20 bucks is going to be a great deal like someone in your situation loki
5749800	5754040	where you have a family of four 20 bucks is a deal but for me and i don't think alan is
5754040	5758120	interested in it i mean i guess i'll ask but for me i'd be paying 20 bucks to watch it myself
5758120	5763480	so and my normal brain goes i'll go over to someone else's house and watch it but i guess
5763480	5768040	i can't really do that right now um so i'm gonna i'm gonna just hold off a little bit and see if
5768040	5771240	the price comes down a little bit you know you have a lot of stuff you have a lot of stuff that's
5771240	5777880	going direct to netflix and disney plus especially with the uh uh frozen 2 was just like all right
5777880	5781320	well since y'all are gonna be stuck at home why not we'll just put out frozen two today
5781320	5786200	and then uh what onward like just came out on digital and they've already said it's gonna be
5786200	5790040	on disney plus in like three weeks or something like that so that's two weeks they have a two
5790040	5796040	week window on that and same with sonic so sonic is going to be coming out later on um in may 19th
5796040	5800040	they're going to do the physical release of that and they're also going to digital rentals that
5800040	5804680	might be a little bit cheaper than twenty dollars but i'll do the want to watch it i'll do the
5804680	5808120	digital rental i don't feel like sonic is a movie i'm going to particularly want to own
5808120	5811160	but i'll if it's like a 499 rental sure i'll do that
5813960	5819560	all right so uh there you go so let me move on uh some of the rapid fire stories i have tonight
5819560	5826440	world of warcraft is offering a 100 experience bonus uh admittedly i haven't played wow in a
5826440	5831080	little bit but i thought this was kind of an interesting way to um you know kind of
5831080	5835720	entice people to check out the game while you know folks are kind of housebound at this point
5835720	5841800	um but uh blizzard has mentioned that from now until april 20th so that's a pretty big window
5841800	5847560	um your warcraft character gets winds of wisdom that means you get a 100 XP bonus the buff is
5847560	5854040	available in battle of azeroth legion and starter edition players if you're playing world warcraft
5854040	5860120	classic you signed up for a grind no xp buff for you so that's that's that um
5861640	5866760	now uh of course you can use this to get your characters all leveled up because uh you know
5866760	5870440	there's going to be a new expansion of world of warcraft coming out i think this fall but one
5870440	5874040	thing i think is interesting to point out is that they're offering this whole like level and get
5874040	5879640	there faster but don't forget your character is going to get squished so remember that the level
5879640	5883880	squish is coming so even if you make it all the way to level what is 120 i think it's the cap
5883880	5890120	right now you're gonna squish all the way down to 50 uh but keep in mind the squish i mean it
5890120	5895240	doesn't mean if you level to 50 and stop you'll carry over as 50 it's kind of like a sliding
5895240	5899480	squish like a level 50 character would be what like probably like level 20 or something once
5899480	5904520	the squish happens so do keep that in mind but uh yeah you're you are going to be getting 100
5904520	5910840	xp but uh there's the squish coming so uh don't get too used to being that high a level uh also
5910840	5917640	in blizzard's world right now they have announced a new overwatch hero uh named echo uh echo is a
5917640	5924040	new character with sound abilities it's a new dps character uh and is it a dolphin is it a
5924920	5930760	echo is not a dolphin echo uses a mimicked hero's ultimate ability as well that is interesting
5931080	5936840	echo is visually and audibly distinguishable from other characters when she i guess i i didn't know
5936840	5942600	echo had a gender but apparently echo is she uh echo uh adopts another form uh she cannot clone
5942600	5949000	the other team's echo though the main weapon is called tri shot so anyway that is all there uh
5949000	5955160	echo is currently on the ptr that part surprised me because my assumption was that no more heroes
5955160	5964040	were coming until overwatch 2 um so i would so she's the team fortress 2 spy i guess yeah i
5964040	5968200	haven't played team fortress 2 in a long time but does the spy clone people's big abilities
5968200	5973080	because that's what echo does don't remember but i know you can look like the other people so
5973080	5978040	maybe admittedly i haven't played overwatch in a little while alan still plays it a little bit
5978040	5984120	um but i haven't checked i he has been playing he's been doing his annual or bi-annual i don't
5984120	5989000	know like playthrough of the mass effect trilogy and when he plays mass effect he does every side
5989000	5994760	quest everything so he just got this weekend to mass effect 2 so i don't think he's touched
5994760	6000440	overwatch in a little bit because he's on that right now so uh fifth dream today says echo equals
6000440	6006280	shang tsung that's not a bad comparison because i believe uh shang tsung had his own abilities
6006280	6013240	but then he could kind of like copy others so that's a pretty good comparison so ss200 matt
6013240	6019480	says she's ditto she can't copy another ditto you guys are on a roll i guess this is a gaming trope
6019480	6024920	we've seen several times before uh but not too surprising all right anyway uh dark soccer how
6024920	6033080	about your rapid fire stories just a couple um so uh for uh people who like free stuff
6033720	6041160	the epic game store is doing uh watchdogs and stanley parable as freebies so go get them
6041720	6048120	um and honestly to be perfectly honest the stanley parable is absolutely worth paying anything so
6048120	6053160	i'll tell you that right now um but yeah go ahead and uh check them out yeah that's one reason i'm
6053160	6057240	glad we highlighted that tonight because uh i think those games are only available for like
6057240	6062440	a week or two so yeah go go grab the stanley parable for sure if you i mean if i realize not
6062440	6065640	everybody's down with the epic store but if the epic store is installed on your computer and it's
6065640	6070200	not a problem for you go get the stanley parable and and why not get watchdogs you might as well
6070200	6075720	right of course some of us already have it on steam and have had it fair but now you'll know
6075720	6085480	what what we love about it um and so also um uh sony is doing uh a kindness it looks like
6085480	6096120	i'm starting on monday march 23rd at 11 59 p.m pacific time so um wow i guess that's going to be
6096120	6103640	yeah late monday um they're releasing both tomb raider and lara croft the the original the 2013
6103640	6111400	tomb raider and lara croft and the temple of osiris for free on steam um it doesn't does it
6111400	6118280	say how long that's going to be going for um it doesn't say but um they have instructions on the
6118760	6126120	square enix site well looks like it's already up now um but at any rate um you can uh
6126920	6131160	they've got instructions on their site but you go in and you'll buy it for zero dollars and
6131880	6137640	um you go to your my orders you unlock the activation key and you do all the instructions
6137640	6142360	so there you go and if you haven't played the tomb raider reboot yet like you know i feel
6142360	6146440	like that game's been out a while now uh you really should get on it that's that's it's a
6146440	6151400	really great um reinvention of tomb raider i had a lot of fun with it so it's definitely
6151400	6158440	worth your time that time is when it ends sorry oh so you gotta really get on that yeah and then
6158440	6163640	i don't even know if you need to do that because they're free right now on steam because i actually
6163640	6167880	downloaded them already right that's what steam that's what this is about is that they're free
6167880	6174520	on steam until tomorrow right exactly yeah their instructions are really like convoluted it's like
6174520	6180200	a login to your square enix games account and i think they're having people do it on the website
6180200	6186600	so it's done might be convincing people to sign up for a square enix account so that they can send
6186600	6191800	you emails about their upcoming products because that's how i heard about this was i got an email
6191800	6197320	from square enix because i'm i'm a final fantasy 11 and 14 subscriber and i'm pretty sure i used
6197320	6201800	their official store at one point to get like a heaven's word collector's edition of final fantasy
6201800	6207400	14 or something so um yeah now i'm on the mailing list yeah just skip all that just go straight to
6207400	6212200	steam and just add them to your collection yeah it's easier through the app i think that their
6212920	6220760	instructions were um uh more pertaining to buying it through the website got it all right well
6220760	6225240	let's travel around the world and check out the upcoming releases because uh you know there are
6225240	6230600	still games coming out and especially because so much is digital in this day and age um you know i
6230600	6237560	don't i i do enjoy my physical copies i'm gonna hope that my final fantasy 7 um re remaster or
6237560	6242120	whatever uh re remake i hope the fantasy sim remake i ordered it through amazon so i'm gonna
6242120	6246760	hope it still shows up on the release day uh i did not get the collector's edition i heard there was
6246760	6252200	a whole bump but i'm prepared that it might because yes like many of you i have heard that
6252200	6257320	amazon is shifting some of their priorities and i get it but if we're going to be on house arrest
6257320	6262360	through the end of april then like i'm not in a huge rush like if i get it a few days late i
6262360	6266280	get it a few days late whatever anyway but let's travel around the world and check out what's

6332040	6339160	know if i heard that but that is out this week on the switch it's important no i i did not say that
6339160	6344040	like that's what we need right now is mama to fix it because we've got a fucking mess going on
6344040	6349400	we need mama to fix it so anyway something to think about all right well i'll travel to japan
6349400	6354040	here uh and check out the japanese releases of which uh there's just a couple things this week
6354040	6360280	on the switch one piece pirate warriors 4 is out this week revenge of justice is also out and on
6360280	6365640	the nintendo switch space invaders invincible collection i have no idea what that is it looks
6365640	6370680	like there's a whole like it comes with a space invaders switch game uh and a whole bunch of like
6370680	6375480	little collectibles thing and keep in mind the space invaders phenomenon like that a lot of that
6375480	6381560	was japan like there was it was huge there it's it's really a part of their culture um it does
6381560	6387240	come with the space invaders original from 1978 it comes with space invaders part two space invaders
6387240	6393800	91 and space invaders extreme that's pretty cool as well as space invaders dx space cyclone lunar
6393800	6397960	rescue and apparently more to come with that so that's a pretty cool collection i wonder if that's
6397960	6402280	coming out here in the states at some point but the space invaders invincible collection is coming
6402280	6406840	out this week in japan on the switch now looking at the playstation 4 real quick we see a lot of
6406840	6411880	overlap because revenge of justice is out there as well as well as one piece pirate warriors 4
6411880	6417400	that's basically just collection not out on ps4 though but playstation 4 does also have
6417400	6425080	uh keniro lover ishi is coming out this week and life is strange 2 getting its japanese release
6425080	6428520	yes i know that game's been out here in the us for a bit but the japanese release is finally

6530040	6534520	i understand a lot of you have had your minds in other places this week anyway let's move on
6534520	6536280	and uh to our next story loki
6538440	6545320	all right so uh we were just talking about some free games and so of course it's nice to see that
6545320	6551240	there's some more free games you can play um steam is doing this the steam game festival spring
6551240	6559960	edition between now and the 23rd and with that you can test out uh 59 games that are part of
6559960	6566600	their kind of indie showcase um so these were some from indie mega booth wings fun indie mix
6566600	6573320	data devs and you can check them out uh some of the more notable ones i saw in there let's see
6573320	6581000	here there's a long list um i don't know there's some pretty cool games like uh skate bird that
6581000	6587160	was one that was pretty cool i know i've been following them on twitter um what was the other
6587160	6598120	ones uh there's a game called coffee talk kung fu kickball clang 2 uh giant silent bob mall brawl
6598680	6607320	um that's kind of interesting and yeah so lots of uh different demos you can check out um granted
6607320	6611960	you want to do it sooner than later because you know time is running out but i imagine that more
6611960	6615720	these types of things are going to be available i know there is even a curated list that someone
6615720	6621800	did of um different games that have been available and like even all these different game jams are
6621800	6628040	going on they have one about uh the whole covid19 stuff about staying inside and um there's a pretty
6628040	6634680	funny one about feeding animals at a park and you're this old guy and you have to feed the
6634680	6639800	animals the right food and then if they get too uppity on you you hit them with your stick so i
6639800	6644920	thought that was hilarious um so yeah check it out um you know lots of different free games even
6644920	6649240	on hiio and stuff but uh this would be a cool place to check out some of these indie games that
6649240	6655960	were shown off and some of these festivals that actually been closed coffee talk the game neither
6655960	6661080	about coffee nor talking discuss no i actually don't know what that game is about but uh i
6661080	6664760	couldn't help but think of that since we're gonna bring up saturday night live on this show old
6664760	6671800	school from the 90s dana carvey and then mike myers and coffee talk so all right um
6672680	6676120	i will have to check out some of the games i had no idea there was a jay and silent bob game
6676120	6681960	in that expo i have to check that out yeah i'm assuming that ties in with the new movie which i
6681960	6691400	did get that chance to watch the movie this week and uh it's okay it's it's all right
6691560	6692200	all right
6694440	6702360	all right well let's move on and uh talk about uh this samsung story so samsung uh is actually
6702360	6710440	going to be closing their pc to mobile service uh samsung is um uh and it kind of strikes a chord
6710440	6714360	right now because i feel like nvidia has like a similar thing going on i mean i know it's not
6714360	6717880	pc to mobile it's like a different thing but i feel like a lot of these things are under the
6717880	6722600	microscope right now but samsung is going to be closing their service on march the 27th
6722600	6728440	so uh play galaxy link allowed you to play pc games on your phone um so they are shutting down
6728440	6734360	the game streaming service on uh march 27th sadly they didn't say why just internal policy changes
6734360	6737800	but i couldn't help but wonder if some of the stuff we've watched is happening to in video with
6737800	6741800	something i wonder if some of that was coming into play i don't know but they didn't confirm or deny
6741800	6749080	any of that they're just saying they want to more effectively refocus its resources um also of note
6749080	6754280	samsung has also noted that they're teaming up with microsoft on a game streaming experience
6754280	6760360	that'll show up later in 2020 could it be that samsung is somehow involved with xcloud or
6760360	6765640	something along those lines we have yet to see but that is something that is uh looking like
6765640	6771320	it could be in the um future for samsung but for now their current service is going to be going
6771320	6777640	away um moving on to talk quickly about a third-party app that actually will make your
6777640	6785160	smartphone into a virtual joycon so let's say you uh lose your joycon or you want another one or
6785160	6789480	something like that it's interesting uh there's apparently an app out there and right now it's
6789480	6793960	only on android but who knows if it's allowed to stick around maybe it'll show up other places too
6793960	6801000	uh the android uh phone has a game call or an app called joycon droid and it will allow your phone
6801000	6807560	to be a virtual joycon um it'll work but it's probably you know again keep in mind the actual
6807560	6813800	joy cons have a lot more tech inside them that your phones don't actually have so while it might
6813800	6819160	help you like have a buzzer in a game or something like that i wouldn't really want to use this to
6819160	6826280	play every game but it's it might work for animal crossing heck so there is that all right just a
6826280	6830600	couple more stories for you guys before we get to uh listener round table which tonight is just
6830600	6834200	going to be exclusive to our chat room so if you have questions you might want to start putting
6834200	6839000	those out in our chat room uh so like i was going to say with that whole joycon thing that's a
6839000	6842680	pretty good idea just for like even like mario party or something like that so you have your
6842680	6848040	friends over and like you don't want to buy 80 you know pairs of controllers so you just have
6848040	6853080	a joycon for each person just grab a bunch of phones and set it up that way well you know one
6853080	6857320	thing that missed our show world tonight was the whole uh intellivision trailer that came out so
6857560	6861080	intellivision put out a new trailer right bobby talked about this on his show a little bit
6861080	6865960	and i'd seen the trailer earlier in the week and the whole like controller via smartphone app i
6865960	6870040	believe that's something intellivision confirmed they want to do so that way you know because
6870040	6875400	they're trying to be very big on multiplayer gaming in the same room uh family game night
6875400	6879560	type of things and it would make a lot of sense like oh hey i only have two controllers you know
6879560	6883160	what instead of charging families money to go buy an extra controller well they can do that if they
6883160	6886920	want for the collectability or whatever but you can use a smartphone maybe if it's something that
6887080	6891640	you aren't gonna use very often or something like that so it's kind of interesting it's like a
6891640	6897400	similar idea that's kind of baked into the system and then of course you can't help but think about
6897400	6903640	jackbox party pack where i feel like the whole smartphone controller thing really started i mean
6903640	6907160	sure i think we've always had mods and and all these types of things but i i feel like that
6907160	6912120	really took off with jackbox party pack which those games are having a real i don't know if
6912120	6916680	you guys have noticed but i noticed those games are showing up everywhere right now um with this
6916680	6921960	situation a lot of friends of mine um staying in touch by playing those games over the internet
6922840	6928120	since they're so easy to really pick up and go so kind of interesting all right well anyhow
6928120	6932040	let's move on uh loki you got another story for us before we get to listen to round table
6933560	6940600	yeah so this is interesting so uh we had of course the whole reveal of some of the specs of the
6940600	6949000	xbox series x last week and then of course this week we then get major nelson putting out a tweet
6949000	6955720	about a release date now he said that you know an xbox product page in some regions um you know
6955720	6963320	originally they had uh said there was showing a holiday or a thanksgiving 2020 release of course
6964120	6968360	come to find out that's not necessarily true he's actually clarified that it's
6968360	6974040	just holiday right now so whoops we accidentally uh put a release date where there is none so
6974040	6978680	i mean i'm assuming it'll come out around that time but it hasn't been confirmed yet yeah i
6978680	6981880	think it's one of those things where people are reading into it nobody's gonna launch a console
6981880	6986920	on a holiday like that and even even with the controversial stores being open on thanksgiving
6986920	6990680	and that whole stuff like they're not they're not gonna launch a console on that day but i think
6990680	6995560	that gives you an idea oh that's around the time frame which of course it's around the time frame
6995560	7001640	they're gonna launch the console uh almost almost big almost every console has launched in november
7001640	7006840	one of the big exceptions of course being the switch which launched in the spring um but it
7006840	7012920	looks like microsoft is still targeting that fall holiday time frame and kind of confirming that in
7012920	7018920	light of everything that's going on in the world with covid now um it could still get pushed back
7018920	7024520	i wouldn't be shocked at all if something like playstation 5 or xbox uh x gets pushed back to
7024520	7030680	spring next year even further back depending on what's happening but um you know uh that's
7030680	7034360	certainly what they're aiming for and i don't think that's a huge surprise right and that could
7034360	7039560	have been the original plan that it was going to be thanksgiving but uh or around that time but you
7039560	7044920	never know with the way supply chains are now and with everyone not working because of everything
7044920	7050840	it's it's hard to say i mean it's still a wait we'll see there's still a long way to go to see
7050840	7055560	kind of like what the the where all the cards kind of land and it really just depends on how
7055560	7061320	long does this go on you know so we'll see all right well moving on to talk about uh google
7061320	7066920	stadia and kind of the first discount for google stadia for the hardware and i'm using my quotee
7066920	7071800	fingers because again i think we all know generally the the actual concept of stadia is that you're
7071800	7076280	not going to need hardware for google stadia you'll be able to play it in a browser but
7076280	7082520	the google stadia starter pack has gotten a discount so uh and it was just in time for
7082520	7087960	doom eternal which is something that you can play on stadia if you like so uh it was just a one day
7087960	7093560	i think it was today or it was earlier this week uh was the sale so i'm not sure you can still take
7093560	7098680	advantage of it unfortunately but it's still worth highlighting because it is a sale already
7098680	7103800	on stadia hardware so just take that what it is but they had knocked down the price to 99
7104520	7111880	instead of 129 and that was the controller the chrome cast ultra and three months of stadia pro
7111880	7116760	so um i don't know if anybody took advantage of that because of doom eternal or if anybody's
7116760	7123480	been playing uh doom eternal on google stadia but uh that is available so i'm still curious to see
7123480	7130280	what happens with a um you know browser launch and kind of the launch for stadia for other platforms
7130280	7135160	i got a chrome cast uh or excuse me not a chrome cast a chrome book that's not doing a heck of a
7135160	7140200	lot right now uh it's pretty much an electric blanket for mr smoosh so um i would be very
7140200	7144840	curious to see what stadia would look like on a system like that because you know that's where
7144840	7149640	i think the street you know because obviously those things don't run a lot but if stadia is
7149640	7154600	mostly streaming it might kind of look games might look pretty good on there for for certain things
7154600	7160680	so we'll see but i imagine everything that's going on in the world again has google reassessing a lot
7160680	7167480	of those types of things and some folks in chat commenting on uh yes mr smoosh was getting picked
7167480	7172280	up in the background because uh his other dad decided that now is a great time to open up one
7172280	7177080	of those smelly cans of food and so smoosh comes running because he smells the food uh and uh yeah
7177080	7181480	as 200 matt saying smoosh has thoughts on that topic he thinks the xbox should be released on
7181480	7186440	thanksgiving so he can eat some turkey while everybody is playing the new console yeah fair
7186440	7192200	enough fair enough all right well uh this is the part of the show where we would get to the listener
7192200	7196760	round table uh if you guys have questions in chat for us go ahead and ask them over at twitch tv
7196760	7201960	slash vog network uh for tonight we are going to forego discord because we're using discord
7201960	7206920	to connect us uh to the show right now um so we're going to forego that for now but if you
7206920	7210840	do have general questions or comments you can put those in our chat room and we'll be reading some
7210840	7217400	of those on here uh pod culture in chat says bring smoosh on cam uh i would love to but that
7217400	7223640	requires me leaving cam to go get him and he just dug into his food he's not gonna want to leave
7223640	7227640	that he'll be very unhappy if i take him away from that so you're gonna sadly have to give him
7227640	7232200	a little while and the show will probably be done by the time he's ready because you know he has to
7232200	7237160	chow it all down and he's gonna be you know he's gonna sit down and be fat for a little bit
7237160	7244600	then kind of go over and drink a little bit of water and all that good stuff so anyway um i
7244600	7248360	don't know if you guys have any last minute stories while we wait and see if anybody's got
7248360	7256760	questions or comments for us in chat um sure i do so uh since of course everybody is canceling all
7256760	7263800	sports uh one of those sports that's been affected by that is formula one and so because of that
7263800	7269480	formula one has announced that f1 esports virtual grand prix series is going to be a thing that
7269480	7275240	happens this year and with that they're going to have a number of the current f1 drivers playing
7275240	7283240	the official codemasters game f1 2019 and on pc in having that broadcast worldwide in lieu of the
7283240	7288840	races that's kind of neat um and bobby was talking a little bit on a show about i don't know if it
7288840	7296120	was this or something similar but apparently there was some racing esports on tv today because
7296120	7300600	today was supposed to be a nascar day and it's kind of kind of an interesting situation with
7300600	7305880	the world that we're in all these sporting events are getting cancelled so what are the tv stations
7305880	7312360	going to show uh and so some i'm sure some are doing movies of the week and so forth but uh some
7312360	7319640	are showing esports events so if you can't do nascar why not do e nascar i think yes and then
7319640	7327400	as bobby's putting it uh espn 2 is doing the ocho so they had a lot of um crazy different events
7327400	7333000	in there i know uh one of the like marble racing that they do on youtube was one of the things that
7333000	7339560	they are showing in there they're the tetris uh championships i want to say they were doing like
7339560	7344360	some sort of eating contest at one point axe throwing or something i don't know it's all
7344360	7351560	sorts of fun stuff almost makes me wish i had espn uh and nascar's was the i racing was the name of
7351560	7357800	that game that they were um doing on uh tv um here's a comment uh from chat uh or question
7357800	7362920	act deaf says i got a question with this quarantine taking place do you think twitch
7362920	7368120	streaming will now be something that people start doing now well not only twitch but you get the
7368120	7374440	idea um absolutely um i think twitch is a very interesting way for people to kind of keep in
7374440	7382280	touch um i also notice our numbers for viewing are up slightly tonight i mean not a ton but
7382280	7387880	they're up slightly tonight because all the usual things that we're up against such as sporting
7387880	7394760	events uh and so forth are are cancelled um i'm you'd be surprised i'm not happy about that
7394760	7399320	because i kind of like the way the world used to be um i understand why we're in this scenario and
7399320	7405800	so forth um so i guess i'll take it but um yeah i think more people are drawn to twitch because
7405800	7411560	people are making original content out of their homes um and i think there are a lot of big
7411560	7418440	personalities out there and so forth where when you know the with when to create content for twitch
7419320	7424440	or youtube or a lot of stuff all you really need is yourself and a camera you don't necessarily
7424440	7430600	need a big uh film crew to be able to make that kind of stuff so i think that space is where
7430600	7438920	you're gonna see content now that doesn't mean it's all gonna be good content because i talked
7438920	7444280	earlier about the youtubers that blew the sony stuff way out of proportion and that's part of
7444280	7449800	what i think we're gonna miss about the professional filmmakers and the professional stuff is that that
7449800	7454440	kind of quality level not to say the indie stuff is bad i would not want to shoot ourselves on the
7454440	7460520	foot like that but there is a certain type of uh quality process we'll say that goes with that
7460520	7466040	professional caliber of uh streaming and television production and so forth that i think some of us
7466040	7472600	will start to miss the longer that this goes on but um television survived the writer's strike
7473240	7478120	it'll survive this too um not everything survived the writer's strike though remember remember the
7478120	7485000	tv shows heroes when it was good yeah uh i know you know it's funny i watched the uh show on
7485000	7490920	netflix actually this week called freaks that kind of reminded me of like a pilot for a hero
7490920	7495080	type show it was actually pretty cool so hey that's something you guys could watch you know
7495080	7500440	it says uh everyone's got a lot of free time now i guess um some other great questions from chat
7500440	7504920	sia tabiri is asking where in the world is carmen san diego was mentioned in the convo about the
7504920	7510840	hall of fame topic uh any thoughts on the best carmen san diego tv series adaptation
7510840	7516840	where in the world versus where on earth the cartoon versus where in time the tv show uh later
7516840	7520760	one i know it's a tangent but it's a fun conversation i have to be honest i haven't really
7520760	7525640	seen the netflix specials so the only thing i know of when it comes to television and where in the
7525640	7532120	world is carmen san diego is the old pbs game show uh with the the the rockafellas singing the theme
7532120	7538760	song and all that stuff and i i i i don't go ahead i played a lot on a map on the first mac
7538760	7544520	came out in 1984 i played a lot of it and then i played where in time where in time for me was
7544520	7550520	more fun because it was history too um sia tabiri is curious about the tv adaptations though if you
7550520	7558280	have a particular favorite i didn't really watch much of any of them i would just do the themes
7558840	7567640	go do my day yeah i think i watched the original like um the carmen san diego show i don't think
7567640	7574120	i've seen where in time but the original was all right yeah uh yeah i like the game show it was a
7574120	7578680	lot of fun i like pbs had a lot of really good shows in the 90s but that just might be you know
7578680	7585320	my my kid slash teen voice coming through i don't know uh what do we get in the twitch marathon of
7585320	7590920	like three two one contact and stuff like all that like nothing is off the table for how people
7590920	7597560	are going to resolve their boredom so stay tuned anyway um let's see uh quest buster says as a
7597560	7603080	tangent on the streaming note more people are definitely heading online to play steam logged
7603080	7607080	its highest number of concurrent users last week if i recall correctly yeah we had a story about
7607080	7611720	that briefly last week that steam reached an all-time high and they're probably gonna keep
7611720	7617000	those numbers are gonna keep going up and up unlike the stock market wamp wamp but yeah those
7617000	7623480	numbers are probably gonna keep climbing um let's see uh s200 matt says the entertainment industry
7623480	7631400	will bounce back some of your local businesses may not yeah it's a very um very real prospect
7631400	7637640	um so you know those of you that have the income to be able to spend on things like local businesses
7637640	7641400	i hope you're planning to do so when those businesses open back up or if they're serving
7641400	7647240	food to go right now those are great places to support um so i was going to mention real quick
7647240	7653400	about the twitch traffic so they are saying that um overall year over year there's been a three
7653400	7661000	percent increase in new accounts on twitch and then 15 increase over the last few days of
7661000	7666440	streaming on twitch wow i'm not surprised this is the time where people pick up a new hobby and
7666440	7671800	things like that you know and that's uh to pass the time and i'm i'm all for it you know somebody
7671800	7676040	we might have some great new voices out there that uh haven't been heard yet that will be through all
7676040	7681480	this um tiger claw mentioning the funny thing is i've been doing the whole self-isolation thing for
7681480	7685240	years with friends living in another state and some relatives in another city i've been alone
7685240	7690520	for most of my life so if i wanted to play games with someone i can only be via online you know and
7690520	7695080	that's a running gag if you will i'm using my quotey fingers since i don't know if it's really
7695080	7700200	a gag but that this is the moment that introverts have been preparing for is kind of like a line
7700200	7704680	that i hear around uh the internet and you know again i don't i don't want to be insensitive or
7704680	7710360	rude but i definitely think there are like some personalities that are totally okay with like
7710360	7715080	what's going on right now and that's or you know what i mean like are able to adapt easier we'll
7715080	7719000	say that because like like you said tiger claw that this is something you're kind of used to
7719000	7725560	anyway um this is this is a challenge for me i'm gonna be honest this whole thing is it's hard
7725560	7730360	because i'm a little bit more extroverted by nature i like to be around go out with people
7730360	7734600	do stuff on the weekend even if it's just i'm going out to a restaurant with alan and even if
7734600	7738040	it's just us or meeting one or two other people like those are the types of things i like to do
7738040	7744760	and like i know we're only a week in barely but i can kind of like already feel it i'm like dang
7744760	7751000	this is if this goes on for eight weeks it's gonna be hard um i've already been this way for
7751000	7757720	a week yeah honestly it's been beautiful yeah but that's right but that's your personality and my
7757720	7763240	personality i'm saying yeah the thing is is that now it's kind of like what introverts go through
7763240	7772280	in reverse or what people with autism like me go through in reverse you're now in our comfort zone
7772840	7780440	and it's been i don't really have anything to offer people in those circumstances other than
7780440	7786840	that i think that for some of us who are more adapted to this kind of thing we need to be there
7786840	7796040	for the people who aren't i think that's fair so um anyway uh where else i'm looking some folks are
7796040	7799880	talking about i knew somebody that was on the carmen san diego game show it's kind of fun uh
7799880	7804440	fifth dream today says yeah my life definitely less impacted than most because i have social
7804440	7811080	anxiety or other reasons i just stay home as much as possible sure um oh she hulk says support your
7811080	7815240	local podcast as well like olr with some biddies thank you so much for that she hulk really
7815240	7821160	appreciate that um s2100 matt says i do hate the narrative that was floating around that this
7821160	7826440	whole thing was karma to jocks with sports being cancelled what bothers me is that plenty of people
7826440	7831320	who work in sports that aren't jocks or are gamers like everyone else um here's the thing
7832360	7836360	with all that stuff you know and i've heard the crap about boomer doomer and all this other
7836360	7843400	bullshit as well let's keep something in mind human beings have the capability of discriminating
7844200	7850120	viruses don't discriminate and y'all better keep that in the forefront of your mind as to why we're
7850120	7855000	all doing this whole self-isolation and all this stuff i mean yes maybe the statistics are showing
7855000	7862200	that less younger people are um being as severely impacted but that doesn't mean every everybody
7862200	7868200	who's young is immune because this virus doesn't discriminate viruses can't discriminate you know
7868200	7874040	any sense so and if i may jock and boomer also it doesn't fucking matter when it comes to a virus
7874040	7881160	yeah please and for everyone complaining about the shelter in place you know people can still
7881160	7885080	get their necessities they can leave for those things but i want to put this
7885080	7891000	into perspective um in fact someone actually just posted this on twitter and i'm going to steal it
7891720	7897960	and frank lived in a practical closet for two years you can endure the next 10 weeks
7898840	7905320	yeah i i you know i i'm gonna sit here and say it sucks but i'm gonna recognize it's what has
7905320	7912040	to be done and i'll get by you know luckily i have a show like olr to kind of be an outlet of sorts
7912040	7917240	you'd think i would be doing more personal streaming but i'm gonna give you a very honest
7917240	7923000	answer on that um you'd think i would do more personal streaming but kind of like the opposite
7923000	7929480	effect is kind of happening is that because i'm not really able to go out and be social
7930280	7938040	i can't really get the energy to do that during the week as well olr is kind of the type of thing
7938040	7942680	where i've been doing it every week for so long it's like it's just like a habit like it's like
7942680	7947560	it's it's like ingrained into my dna right now at this point um this show is old enough to fucking
7947560	7952440	vote pretty much uh so that's you know kind of like where where olr is at but like when it comes
7952440	7958360	to like the impromptu streaming stuff like it's not as easy for me to do that so that's why i'm
7958360	7963480	being very supportive of like other people who are thriving in what's going on right now you
7963480	7967960	know like dark soccer to use you as an example you've kind of said that and you streamed for
7967960	7972840	the first time in quite some time a couple days ago and you kind of have more a desire to do that
7972840	7978840	and so i kind of see my role right now as because i am having a hard time and i've got to use my
7978840	7984520	energy focusing on not going crazy um i support dark soccer and what she's doing and i support
7984520	7992040	all of the rest of you that want to go out and create content so um other comments in chat um
7992680	7997320	fifth dream today says by shelter in place they mean stop waving your dick in public going you
7997320	8002200	can't tell me what to do and you don't need to buy a car new shoes and have a wedding this week
8002200	8007960	yeah all those things will be waiting for you uh in the summertime hopefully um s2100 matt says i
8007960	8012040	went for a senior drive yesterday i wanted to do something that was wasn't around people but also
8012040	8018600	got me out of the house i love driving uh i find it relaxing so a nice scenic drive filled that
8018600	8024920	void i needed yeah uh and that sounds like a great i might try to do something like that next weekend
8024920	8029880	but the the only challenge i see with that is that i also think a lot of those places where people
8029880	8035320	would usually go like let's say the established trails and things like that are probably going to
8035320	8039800	be very busy and it's going to be very hard to do social distancing at places like that but i know
8039800	8043960	in your case i think you said you picked more of a random type of place to go to and that probably
8043960	8051080	worked out a lot better um i have been like going to the parks nearby i'm trying to go out once a
8051080	8055160	day to walk around the park i wasn't successful with that every day last week but maybe i'll do
8055160	8059160	better this week uh trying to go just like do a lap around the park and so forth so i'm getting
8059160	8063960	a little vitamin d every day and then like i went out to the bigger park i live near just to like
8063960	8070120	go play ingress and it's weird because like right now i could really give a shit about ingress and
8070120	8075720	like the the whole fielding and the scoring and the who's gonna throw a megan on i i don't give
8075720	8081000	a shit because there's more important things right now but yet i did find some odd little comfort
8081000	8086440	that like the uh park near me was kind of blue and i was like oh this gives me a little something to
8086440	8091560	do and i can keep six feet away from other people while i do it okay i did my thing i got outside i
8091560	8096360	got my vitamin d i'll go back home now so and rob yeah i can't do those things
8098040	8104280	oh yeah yeah i'm going out to check my mail is the most i go outside
8106040	8110360	and that that makes perfect sense i mean and when i was going through the swine flu thing years ago
8110360	8116760	it was kind of a similar sort of thing but it also helped in that situation to know it was only for a
8116760	8124200	week and this might go on a lot longer but you know hopefully um yeah i don't know when i'm going
8124200	8130840	to get better or when i'm going to hear from my doctor they're not seeing anybody in person they're
8130840	8141400	doing as much to treat people over the phone or um by email and keep people out of the hospitals
8141400	8145800	yeah because with all the people who could possibly have this disease in the hospital
8145800	8150760	they want to keep the hospitals free for that but yeah there's a covid doesn't stop everything else
8150760	8155240	that could go wrong you know i could still have an accident at home where i slip and break my leg
8155240	8159880	and it's gonna you know it's gonna be gonna be rough so they're gonna be like learn to split
8159880	8166920	bitch yeah right so yeah all right we'll mail you some coding here you go yeah all right well
8166920	8171160	anyway um for now i think we'll go ahead and kind of wrap up with that uh unless loki i don't know
8171160	8173640	if you have any other last minute stories you want to mention before we wrap up here
8173640	8182120	um yeah i was gonna say there's a few more games that are free right now so you should check uh
8182120	8187000	check them out on steam uh the first one being droffle 2 is free until april 10th
8187640	8192920	and goat of duty is free until march 31st so go check those out
8197320	8202200	sorry for the silence i was answering a question in chat there so all right yay more free stuff
8202200	8206680	maybe there'll be even more free stuff in the next week who knows we'll see so um all right
8206680	8210920	i think with that we will probably wrap things up for the night here uh at the voice geeks network
8210920	8215800	and here at orange lounge radio but we will be back in seven days to do it all again uh as far
8215800	8220360	as we know at least until at least until early april the show is probably going to be like this
8220360	8224440	for a little bit so um hope you guys enjoyed it nonetheless even though we weren't all in the same
8224440	8228520	room but i think we were still able to bring you a lot of the stuff that you would expect from a
8228520	8233640	usual edition olr um but let's go around and get everybody's final thought before we wrap up for
8233640	8238760	the night uh dark soccer do you have any final thoughts to leave our folks with tonight i would
8238760	8245720	like to be able to speak without being winded very much well thank you for um going through
8245720	8250520	the show tonight but do i mean hopefully in seven days this isn't as much of a problem but
8250520	8255240	do feel if you need to go like go like take care of yourself don't don't do the dumb thing i did
8255240	8259720	and make my make my strep throat worse by hosting two shows over valentine's day weekend
8259720	8264440	which i still have a cough from because of that and every time i cough like i feel the looks
8264440	8270360	coming on when i'm at the park or something like that so well i've been i've been taking it pretty
8270360	8277000	easy dan's gotten used to reading my my gestures that aren't all you know a single raised digit
8278520	8283320	and we've got fresh bread it was honestly breaking baking bread last night set me off
8283320	8289160	which is usually a stress relief for me because you know i get to beat the crap out of some dough
8289880	8293560	and it's delicious when i'm done it's still delicious don't get me wrong
8294120	8301960	but i was a mess afterwards just baking bread so all right well everyone take care of yourself
8301960	8308360	listen to the signs ret let's listen to doctors uh rest up feel better and uh we'll hope we'll
8308440	8310600	hope when we talk to you in seven days you're doing much better okay
8312040	8315880	thank you you're welcome uh loki any final thoughts tonight
8317000	8322840	i just found out that apparently you can use the toilets in animal crossing
8324600	8329000	that's interesting i guess you actually always been able to use the toilet since the first one
8329000	8333400	yeah but he didn't but i don't believe in every single game he's like and that takes
8333400	8338840	care of that with the flushing they've always had the flushing that's funny that takes care
8338840	8344920	of that that's funny um i need a super toilet now yeah and actually spoiler alert one of the
8344920	8352120	early rewards you get is toilet paper it's almost like animal crossing foretold the future why do
8352120	8359320	you talk to me like this all right y'all really added toilet paper like for real no i was smart
8359480	8364680	bought um an extra pack before things got crazy although we were getting low on paper towels so
8364680	8370360	i had to get some industrial paper towels and so i got these really weird looking brown things that
8370360	8375960	you would normally find in like an office calm oh yeah dan's actually still been uh dealing with
8375960	8383640	his mom's place and there was a stash of toilet paper paper towels and cleaning supplies nice
8384520	8389000	yeah so yeah and i i heard some of the stores restocked today so i think and i think people
8389000	8393880	are calming down a little bit so hopefully that stuff is not going to be as well they're also
8393880	8399640	putting like restrictions on stuff and i know like when i went over i had to go grocery shopping this
8399640	8405960	week and so when i went there they're training tons of people to do the you know picking orders
8405960	8414120	for the pull up and drive up and delivery and um it's still over out of like everything but i'm
8414120	8418200	assuming that eventually it'll get better once they're not letting everybody just run rampant
8418200	8423560	and take everything i will say this too for people who are having a hard time getting some things
8425240	8432120	if you have a asian markets near you um mexican grocery stores uh indian markets
8432760	8440360	those are actually amazing places to get meat um you know you might have to be a little bit more
8440360	8446440	for either kosher or halal at some of the places um middle eastern markets for example but those
8446440	8453560	are great places to stock up on some things and i have seen the uh paper staples there as well so
8453560	8458280	you know just might not have ever been in there might look a little different than what you're
8458280	8462840	used to but they're good places to look for these things yeah you know how i live in kind of like
8462840	8467400	a very korean part of town like all the korean shops and restaurants around here apparently
8467400	8471640	oh yeah go to the smile market yeah apparently over at smile that's like the place you can still
8471640	8475320	get toilet paper so i thought that was kind of interesting at least that's what they said on next
8475320	8479480	door now that that came out though it's probably gone because usually when i think to go to the
8479480	8484520	korean market i go all the way to the gigantic they have this place called kp plaza for those
8484520	8489240	that you know don't live here uh which is like two supermarkets because it literally used to be like
8489240	8494120	a ralphson another supermarket it's two supermarkets fused together that is like nothing but international
8494120	8499000	stuff and that's where i usually go when i want to go to like a korean or a i'll just go to the
8499000	8505560	huge one that's like everything the united nations of food except i was very disappointed when i
8505560	8511960	went there last time i could not find stroopwafel when i was there i have to go to the but that's
8511960	8515480	getting more and more popular at the regular store i found i found stroopwafel just a save
8515480	8525080	mark the other day also places like home goods ross um marshall's owns home goods on tuesday
8525080	8534440	morning they've actually had things like pasta um packaged non uh non-refrigerables um you know
8534440	8538840	like i found like some good indian food and rice and i found truffle pasta at home goods
8539400	8546440	um they have seasoning and spices there rob they have coffee at um your k-cups perfect um so
8547400	8552440	people may not think of those places but totally look at those places um you're if you've got a
8552440	8557960	cost plus world market near you go there they've got coffee and tea and international stuff and
8557960	8563640	sausages and things so think outside the box if you're running out of your staples just saying
8564360	8569240	all right well i think with those uh notes my final thought uh because i have to say it at
8569240	8573640	some point would be if you enjoyed uh orange entre do don't forget to uh help us spread the word we
8573640	8577720	are the show where every gamer has excuse me i have the hiccups where every gamer has the hiccups
8577720	8583160	where every gamer has a voice but we can't get those voices out there um if the folks don't know

8600680	8605080	um and yeah nice five star review on a site like itunes or wherever you found this podcast just
8605080	8609880	sharing the spotify link or anything like that all of that goes an awful long way i have the last
8609880	8615080	bit the last bit of uh breaking news here right apparently harvey weinstein has tested positive
8615080	8623720	for coronavirus in jail oh oh i heard that that was a little earlier so and uh ran paul
8623720	8630120	how is it too couldn't happen to better people i i don't know why my brain immediately went to harvey
8630120	8636520	firestein no god no no no and i got really concerned for a minute i was like no please but
8636520	8641240	then when you said harvey weinstein tried to come for tom hanks i mean harvey weinstein i was like
8641240	8647000	oh whatever for the record uh tom hanks posted today that he and his wife are doing a lot better
8647640	8657720	and has been using that uh his uh his uh platform to uh to you know encourage others and show them
8657800	8662520	what to do during this situation but the problem with um with wine is that it
8662520	8668840	indicates a wider spread at rikers so oh yeah so just keep that in mind although
8668840	8673560	fucking karma it's the the testing being unavailable means a lot more people have
8673560	8676920	this than what's being reported i mean just look at what's happening amongst the famous people
8676920	8682520	it's adrice elba daniel dae kim um what's her name from the old madonna movies debbie maser
8682520	8688440	uh you know a lot a lot of these folks have it and you know like what you know a lot we
8688440	8692200	we hear about them because they usually i mean a lot of them go out of their way to say i didn't
8692200	8696840	do anything special to get a test or whatever but a lot of these guys you know can get testing a
8696840	8702120	little easier so i think we're hearing more about it so um yeah anyways just it's just kind of scary
8702120	8707400	but just that this is why we're staying home you know uh don't let's let's try to end this thing
8707480	8712520	by not spreading it to anybody else so all right on that note we're gonna wrap up enjoy playing
