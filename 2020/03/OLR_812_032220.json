{"text": " This week Doom Eternal isn't in the show role but it has to be mentioned that it's a fantastic game and it's load times are incredible. This is what I wanted to say, stay tuned for your host stories of the week starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice including Jason. Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice it is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 812 for this March the 22nd of 2020. My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined in studio by Captain Pikachu at my side so here's what's going on. This is a little different for Orange Lounge Radio tonight even though I am here in studio N7 because if you haven't figured it out by now studio N7 is at my house so I'm here. My co-host tonight we're doing a little bit of social distancing as many folks out there in the world are doing because it's the right thing to do to help slow the spread of this horrible thing that's going around that's really you know affecting us all and affecting our world right now. So I am joined though thanks to the magic of discord I am joined tonight by of course DarkSakura or Jamie Summers should be there. Hi. Hi how are you? Um I had a flare-up but um hopefully healing so we'll see. Now as a follow-up to last week you found out that you have pneumonia and not the big C right? That's what she said but um I just finished my antibiotics and um I had a flare-up last night so I don't know um what's going on but I was I had a couple days with no fever and then I started running a fever again last night running a fever today so we'll see. Well my fingers and toes and I'm sure all of us are crossed that uh everything is gonna go just fine with your recovery it's it's one of those really weird kind of uh states of the world in 2020 where we're sitting here going yay it's just pneumonia when that's actually not particularly a great thing to be talking about so but um in all seriousness thank you for being here tonight um despite how you're feeling um but I mean I've relatively is your energy's been there you've been able to play games and do stuff around the house? Well that not that that requires a whole lot of uh energy but um I've uh I've been playing a lot of a lot of stuff on my switch you know what I'm playing and I baked bread which wasn't the best idea but it was delicious. Well hey it's uh hard to find bread at some of the stores right now so I'm I hear a lot of people yeah I hear a lot of people are kind of baking right now um speaking of baking uh also joining us tonight via discord I believe should be there is Techmaster Loki. I'm not baking anything. I thought I thought you said something about the air fryer before we went live. Oh oh no that that's yeah that's Nellie cooking dinner I'm sure it's like some Asian or something. Gotcha okay so again um this is a little new for us uh here at Orange Launch Radio you know we started this show back in 2002 if you were unaware and um you know in that year we didn't really have you know when we started this whole thing on the Live 365 network we were dial-up friendly radios so that was the way many people were still connecting to the internet so we didn't have things like Skype and you know all that there was no iPhone yet or any type of smartphone really at that point um and so we kind of got used to doing this show in the same room um and that's kind of where this show you know and when people ask like well it makes you different than other gaming podcasts I can talk about how long we've been around but also I think part of what makes us a little bit different is that uh we are usually all in the same room so we can kind of play off each other and all that stuff um but obviously as you guys know being in the same room is not really an option right now I mean I guess technically the whole stay at home thing would allow like six people to get together but the reality is um if you can practice social distancing you should so we're setting an example I hope tonight by doing things a little differently but therefore my point with that is the audio quality may not be quite what you're used to so you'll have to forgive us a little bit um but you know we had to kind of throw things together as they say uh to make tonight's show happen uh thanks to the magic of discord so um but of course if you do want to join us live you can we do tape live every sunday night at the voice geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network we're on at 6 p.m pacific nine o'clock eastern right after the bobby black wolf show um again that's over twitch.tv slash vog network and yes bobby does have a good point here um bobby says podcasts are technically exempt from the shelter in place ruling at least in los angeles county but I wouldn't expect a gaming podcast to risk that and yeah it's one of those things where it's like you know if um if maybe our podcast was uh spreading awareness about disease prevention or was like a news-based podcast or something a little more like you know uh traditional media I suppose where there's a benefit for us all being in the same room or out in the field reporting so to speak then yeah we could bend the rules a little bit but since you know we I've heard that we're an essential podcast though so it's fine we can skirt by all of the laws because of that we are an essential podcast I've I believe that's that's the rule that we're setting orange launch radio essential podcasting uh so well okay funny you bring that up because obviously that's going to tie into tonight's kickoff topic which I'm sure is on a lot of people's minds uh this week as they've been reading all the updates with what's going on in the world um dark sakura why don't you start us off because I know you had some thoughts when it came to this topic um well um it's uh I have friends that work there number one and one of my friends flat out told me when I was talking about picking up my pre-order because I had actually switched it to her store um is that um I should just not pick up my game and get it digitally or from somewhere else um after having talked to her she was like yeah and was linking me to all these other people they were telling you know their the press release at game stop was saying that they were sending cleaning material and hand sanitizer to all the stores which was a lie they were telling the managers to go get them and of course where are they there's none to be found and they were having to pay for it out of pocket so um and they were telling people to go home if they were sick but they were calling people in while they were sick because they didn't have enough people to watch the desk or anything like that to keep the store open so um you know it was it was really terrible um and then of course it was putting longer hours on the people who were okay to work and you know and then on top of that they're endangering people by having people come in by not maintaining um any type of proper social distancing and so um and on top of that they're not a freaking essential business I'm sorry well I'm not sorry because they're not yeah and it sounds like you know it's interesting because you know we've taught and I've mentioned this on the show and I'm sure we have folks that work at GameStop stores that listen to this show and I hope you all understand the issues that we've taken up with you know the evil G or whatever you want to call it over the years has nothing to do with the hard-working folks at the stores or even the store managers it's and and I think nothing has ever made this more apparent than this particular story we're talking about now with what's going on with COVID is that you know and you mentioned like you're being told under the table essentially by employees like yo don't come in here because what they're telling you isn't the reality of what's going on they're not saying and I mean that is a huge disconnect when the corporate is saying oh yeah we're we're sending out sanitizer and all that really cuz we're all having a hard time finding it but okay but we're gonna go make our so they're saying they're sending it all out but that's not true they're making the store managers as if they didn't have to go through enough go out and find this stuff when we all know we all have a television that or radio or whatever you use we all know that you can't find that stuff right now so to say that these stores are all stock to that is is untrue and it's it's it's really irresponsible and I I suppose you could make a stretch argument that maybe GameStop deals somewhat in computing supplies and those computing supplies would be important to teleworkers but let's be real that's not what GameStop was selling on Friday night GameStop was selling all those pre-orders of Animal Crossing and Doom Eternal that they wanted to keep those sales on and I think that was pretty apparent and what was going on yeah they it's really you know and not to go on too much of the political side of things but you know we're we're watching the crumbling of capitalism right now because people are trying to first of all you know make a profit at the expense of other people that that's really how I see it you know I mean but on top of that though with so many businesses closing down it's really people don't have a way of bringing in the money and people aren't going out and spending it either so I you know I you can't blame I'm equal you can't blame them but but in the same run when your company is at the core of itself in the business to make money it doesn't really feel responsible to the public that comes out right then and there in in the public so yeah and I think I think you can definitely you know still say like you know without being political I think there's definitely going to be a conversation around all there's gonna be conversation about people being able to stay home sick when they're actually sick there's gonna be a conversation about you know being able to access health care and getting health care needs and whether that should be tied to having a job or not and you know now I don't know what the answer is to that some folks will be you know with Bernie on that some folks will be with more middle-ground Democrats on that some people will be with Trump or possibly Mitt Romney or other Republicans on that because there's all sorts of different answers out there but I think a conversation will certainly be had certainly be had especially just real quick sorry especially with the I guess this would be appropriate use of the term she's in Freud where you have you know the one senator who voted against the one of the stimulus packages has now come down with coronavirus I mean the fact that this is now on Washington DC's doorstep literally and cannot be ignored no matter how you feel about that politician or any of that stuff the fact that is on their doorstep and cannot be ignored that is going to cause a conversation to happen if nothing else I will point this out though that right now Bernie did take his campaign resources and immediately filtered it into providing services to people who are ill jobless and to fighting the the spread of the disease I hope we see all of Washington DC follow suit very soon it is you haven't seen Biden do it we have definitely seen a lot of companies that are really stepping up to be able to like I saw one going on Twitter and I apologize I forget the name of the company in the moment they're coming up and making masks Oh Christian Siriano the fashion designer famous from Project Runway is starting to make more masks for you know New York and and because there's obviously a big outbreak there and so forth so I think you're definitely gonna see and to tie this back to video games you're definitely starting to see when it comes to the corporations who the people are that are stepping up right and who the people are that are slipping down and GameStop is one of those companies that's slipping down because of all this at a time when GameStop needs not to be slipping down and again I feel for a lot of those people on the front lines and so forth because these bad decisions are not theirs but it's making everybody a GameStop look bad and it's it's really unfortunate and I got two words hostile takeover and I know a lot of people are talking maybe Reggie will come in there and reminder Reggie has nothing to do with this if you go back and listen there go go Google News search the Reggie thing and his thing about joining GameStop that's not effective until mid-april so Reggie has nothing to do with any of this in fact he might reverse decision as a result I don't know the contracts may already be signed I don't know but the reality is Reggie's gonna be walking into something big but again he's not gonna be the CEO he's gonna be a member of the board but I don't know if he's gonna necessarily be the hero that everybody hopes he is but we hope there is a hero at GameStop or that comes in and buys them or something and turns them around I think so anyway Loki I don't know if you had some other things you wanted to add to this I know you've been following a lot of what's going around with GameStop right yeah so there was quite a few stories like cuz the whole thing was kind of developing over the week so you first you had of course what Jamie alluded to where there was the memos going out to store saying that they're going to be providing them with you know disinfectant supplies and you basically stuff to kind of stave off some of the germs and everything that might be there you know kind of the same message a lot of different locations were saying and then there was the whole recommendation that they should close you know non-essential retailers and then of course GameStop making the argument that well we are essential retail and we're going to you know fight that order and basically the employees just not even happy with that at all I mean just very much against it a lot of folks quitting over this but it's almost like they suddenly unionized they didn't say that word but you know when everybody kind of bands together to do the it's interesting it's very interesting oh yeah absolutely and then and then what was kind of crazy too is along the same time there was this one youtuber that leaked a call with the executives is one of the GameStop calls that they had talking about the whole situation and everything and that did not sound well because there's a lot of concerned employees that were basically asking me hey what's gonna happen you know you're telling us to come in and you know we're not gonna get paid if we take time off or whatever you know I don't want to be exposed to this I'm you know living with my elderly grandma I I don't want to expose her to kovin 19 and you know they didn't really have much a response other than well we're taking a day at a time and that type of stuff and then kind of funny you know after a whole California you know officially you know say okay you guys have to all close finally then did they actually close their doors but before that you know obviously you could tell what the goal was because they were putting out their pre-orders for both Animal Crossing and Doom Eternal early and then you know some of the follow-up with that it sounds like that finally the CEO is gonna give them some paid time off and some compensation for coming in on these days and then I did find that one funny screenshot where they in Pennsylvania they've yanked their business license at least so that was kind of interesting is that is that proven because that I saw that I think we all many of us saw that picture of the printout that was on the door or something but that didn't look very official to me like it looked like especially something that would use aerial black like that that's just a very it just looked whipped up I don't know word I just yeah I don't know be a little bit you guys and maybe I'm wrong it may have been an official thing because it was whipped up quickly but I don't think there's anything wrong with you have a healthy healthy dose of skepticism with all this crazy amount of news that's coming out about you know the the COVID and all that yeah so here's they have they did send out a letter to from the CEO George Sherman sent out to all of the associates basically saying that effective immediately we've implemented the following for hourly associates that work at source that close or close in the future as a result of COVID-19 any associate directly impacted by COVID-19 at work is required to quarantine hourly employees who are paid time or have PTO are eligible will receive 80 hours of additional PTO in the event that you're not to PTO eligible you'll be paying for we will be paying you for two additional weeks of base pay calculated by the weekly average number hours you work in addition if your full-time benefit eligible employee will be receiving reimbursement for one month of employee benefit contributions for the month of April so at least that's something yeah a little after like dragging them through the street screaming I mean we'll give them we'll give them light snaps on a little light snaps and and still you know question some of the decisions I do want to address what's the discussion happening in the chat room because Tiger Claw is mentioning I posted a screenshot of the notice and has a picture of the notice but you know respectfully Tiger Claw I realize that's what a lot of people are looking at because I saw the reddit post and everything but I actually question that thing's legitimacy and I'm gonna tell you what it is for me there's no wet signature on that and that means that it's been signed I would think any type of actual order to close a business I'm pretty much sure anytime I've ever seen that posted in the window has a signature from either a sheriff who served it or a judge or the county's like there's no signature on there and I'm sorry that's again a healthy dose of skepticism I'm not necessarily saying it's all bullshit but then Bobby says there's literally no official news sources that say Pennsylvania revoked their business license the governor of Pennsylvania did have harsh words but did not take that action and so yeah so I actually I don't think a GameStop was officially closed now did an employee now I'm not saying the sign didn't exist because did an employee whip up that sign because they didn't want to go to work that day and felt unsafe there but possibly there's a lot of that's absolutely possible but there's a lot of explanations out there not necessarily the one that read it's telling you and I think keep that in mind and it's it's very easy to fall for these types of things in this day and age on the internet the other one I'm hearing is not true and I haven't done my own research on this but you know there's the stories going around about how the Venice canals like dolphins and fish are swimming in the canal apparently that one's not true and so interesting so just be careful about all the news that goes around right now it's a tricky time you know there should always be a way to like double source something if you're seeing it from one source hmm especially if that source is read it if you've seen it from two sources especially if one of them is CNN NBC CBS heck Fox I'll allow it when it comes to figuring out if something's legitimate or not in a double validation sort of thing double validate it that's all I'm saying so anyway okay and yeah some folks are saying s200 Matt says no state source would recommend people wear and n95 masks are telling people not to buy those masks because there's a shortage and healthcare people need those yeah so anyway just I'm gonna throw in something yeah just because I used to do property inspections for commercial properties oh yeah back in the day I remember that yeah that sign really isn't too far-fetched to me first of all a lot of those offices are not on max the standard font is aerial at least a lot of them have an upgraded computers and things like that what does give me a little bit of pause is that the way the the extra text on it and on top of that the fact that it looks like it's cut off but those actually are fairly in line with condemnation images like that I linked one from the city of Baltimore now there's are in like a bright yellow I have seen them in white I have seen them just a piece but just a letter written on business head it really is going to vary from place to place and I am suspect of it simply because it is cut off at the bottom I would have expected to have had like you know a professional letter something on cardstock too or at least a heavy paper but I'm not saying I'm I'm saying that font typography choice what have you that actually is not far-fetched but no no signature required that's the thing that's hanging me up I've seen some that have signatures I've seen others that don't a lot of them will have like contact you know X for for that and but usually they will say let me go back and look at it the biggest thing that they're gonna say is the nature of the closure this doesn't give any of it and again with that being cut off it actually looks like it's more of a photocopy of something so those are the things that make me think it's not legitimate not necessarily how it's laid out all right analyzing the receipts with dark Sakura you should seriously consider I mean now is the time to start thinking about those side projects and podcasts you always wanted to do because all of us have a lot of free time all of a sudden you should I would love to see you do a show called like analyzing the receipts where you take like big reddit stories and Facebook shares and try to figure out if they're BS or not although I suppose that's kind of like double double doing what Snopes does but you know I don't think Snopes has the time for this type of thing like they don't care about this one little Game Stop in Pennsylvania actually funny that you mentioned that Snopes has a big letter on their main page looking for a donation so they can keep up what they're doing because they've been inundated with so I would say people can help Snopes out this is a really important time for us to make sure we have factual information going out and this isn't the time to be posting stuff oh well it was funny or oh it sounded like it could have been right fact check every fucking thing before you post it because lives depend on yeah be very careful right now in social media there's so much there's so much going around all right I will absolutely call you out Loki we we we've got off base a little bit I don't know if there was anything else you want to add to the GameStop saga no that's pretty much it they said that the stores that are gonna remain open which I can't imagine that's gonna be for very long are doing my guess I guess you can pick up at the door type of stuff where you can order through the app I mean do people really need physical games that badly I don't know well Bobby shared a story about Animal Crossing and how you can't share a digital copy so if him and his wife will both want to play it makes more sense for them to have a physical copy so like I kind of get those types of scenarios and you know I I we've talked we've had the digital versus physical debate here on this show before some people just prefer to have something tangible that they can eventually sell back since you know GameStop is kind of in that business but long story short the the whole drive up solution I think is is a fair compromise and probably what should have been implemented in the first place interestingly enough they're not the only business to be doing something like that I believe Best Buy is starting something like that very soon which you know now even more so with Best Buy yes I could see where Best Buy is very important right now with so many people or in stores like it I don't want to give them free advertising but electronic stores will say in general because with so many people working from home you have what if what if a monitor goes bad what if a power cord or you got to replace a surge protector things like that that makes a lot more sense you got to drive up and and to be fair GameStop has a limited amount but they do have some of those things I guess so what if I don't have my Funko pops and they can't work but yeah the one of my desk just fell over but anyway um yeah like the drive-up thing makes a lot more sense um Allen actually just went out to get pet food because not only do we have to eat but mr. smoosh has to eat and mr. smoosh because if you guys have seen him which if you watch live on twitch he's always there at the beginning of the show you see that his face is smoosh it's actually not why we call him that we call him mr. smoosh because when you put out your hand for him to like lick your finger or something he will just ram his whole face into your hand he smooshes his face in your hands that's why we call mr. smoosh but he does have a smoosh face so he doesn't really have much of a nose so we have to buy a very specific type of pet food for him that is very smelly we have to buy like very smelly fish cat food or else he doesn't know he doesn't recognize that it's food really so we go to a specialty pet food store and that's what they do he Allen drives up in the car basically and I think he did walk up to a table and they went in the store got it brought it out rung it up hand sanitizer for both of them right outside and on to the next person that comes up so this whole concept of like drive up get what you need and leave is being implemented in other places as well not just what what GameStop's got going on also things to point out here Bobby Blackwell pointing out Best Buy also sells kitchen appliances so they're a little more essential I didn't think about that what if I mean what if the fridge breaks down during this whole thing or the freezer you know you got you got to worry about that but they aren't doing in-home delivery of those appliances they'll drop the new fridge at your front door and tell you good luck yikes that's gonna make it a little more difficult but nothing a good old YouTube search can't solve hopefully when it comes to installing anything you can find it on YouTube somewhere I'm sure so anyway yeah lots of lots of crazy changes that are gonna be happening and you know crossing our fingers and toes that we're talking about weeks and not months but be prepared for anything the official statement is eight to ten weeks yeah it could it could be some time so and we're seeing a lot of stuff as far out as May getting cancelled even some June I mean we know about e3 and so forth but I just saw today Portland retro Expo got cancelled and they were in I actually think I feel like they're all the way out in like July or August but they're more concerned about well they can't predict the future and what's gonna go on but also be just the fact that you know with all this going on the economic impact of the small businesses that the retro convention tends to you know attract and things like that like it's just so hard to know so there's there's events all summer that are starting to get cancelled dark soccer you post on Facebook the California pinball thing got cancelled too and that was during the summer right Golden State pinball it's in May and actually I was just I saw something go up that says a bay is considering postponing the Olympics in Japan yeah so that's tragic Jamie I mean where are you gonna go to play pinball now that still but also some of the events for the sisters were cancelled our Easter thing well they said postponed pride and I think LA is getting no not la Placerville I think one of them is getting you're right la la is got cancelled straight out a couple other places I have moved there so August Davis did Davis did that's it so yeah it's just a lot of a lot of stuff going on so you know fingers and toes crossed the Dragon Con still happens but I'm trying to mentally prepare myself for the fact that it might not but I'm trying to be optimistic and you know I know there's other optimistic folks out there so I'm trying to stay that weapon of just preparing myself for that possibility is you know it just might be the case we were gonna be doing a live showing of clue in April obviously that got pushed back it got pushed back to June I'm getting worried it's gonna get pushed back again but if that's what it takes to save people especially elderly folks and so forth then it's it's what we got to do so all right well one thing I'm sure we're all doing right now in this time is playing a lot of video games to get by so let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week and we'll start with dark soccer as if I had any question whatsoever as to what she's been playing this week sorry I've been muting my mic as I have to cough a lot no you're fine well it's been Animal Crossing I keep forgetting to look at pocket camp even I might even just quit playing it but I am really enjoying New Horizons I am on my third loan starting tomorrow and I should be able to save up everything to pay it off tonight I I've already recruited new new villagers to move in a place their houses and actually trying to get furniture for one of the houses now it adds a lot more to the game I think with all of these kind of fetch quest II things if that makes sense sure but but I streamed my first day playing I finally got my audio to work for one whole stream I joined your stream justice you were saying good night I ended up just being really really exhausted and it was I was sitting in a folding chair because it's kind of a crappy setup I have where I had my MacBook with that elgato plugged into it but for some reason the switch doesn't do the output to TV and to my Mac at the same time so I'm only getting audio on on the capture HD app so up to date everything I've done all my troubleshooting OBS doesn't work with it at all hmm yeah so I haven't it just doesn't even detect the the card and I've done of course all the troubleshooting I have no excuse not to know how to do it so if it happens again I might have to rethink how I'm doing it but yeah I played how many I started it at 9 and played until 3 a.m. and then yesterday I played for 10 hours no Friday I paid played for 10 hours yesterday I played for about six hours but I started getting so ill that I had to lay down and today I played for a couple and then I took a nap and now I'm doing the show wow you're making me you're making me look like a filthy casual I haven't even opened the game yet today I'm supposed to I'm supposed to get my museum finally today I'm so behind like I haven't even found the nuggets to get the store yet I should have them tonight if I play if I play a little bit after the show which I probably will I should have the nuggets tonight are you going to the the island I went to one island but I was saving my nook points to get the inventory expansion and the tool the tool act the circular tool access thing because those sounded very important and then I just barely got another 2,000 miles but I was like oh I should save these because maybe when I pay off the loan it's gonna open up even more inventory space or something but keep in mind by opening the museum and all the other things you get many many more nook miles I've been spending them like like they're going out of like they're going out of fashion okay and I still have 13,000 look miles right now so what do you think of the new Animal Crossing game compared to the old ones this one has a lot more to do with it by the way let me continue one other thing sorry get your first get your first loan oh yeah already work I already have the house okay good because what you get those extra five items on top of your nook miles app yeah those give you miles like for doing basic shit yeah the little dailies I call them dailies even though they just kind of keep going but yeah I've cycled through 30 of them in a day but that if this is one of the new things that this new Animal Crossing game kind of brings in that the old ones didn't have is that you have like these you know daily quests but then once you finish them little other short quests kind of pop in so this was a mechanism and you get these nook miles which are not the same thing as currency but you can use them to get either the trips to the random island or I think they have like hairstyles shirts there's certain things that are tied I've unlocked all the hairstyles half the clothes are ugly but I did get a leaf rug and I got the umbrella I you also if you check the terminal every day you get nook miles if you you also every so often get achievements for just buying regular stuff so the the store changes daily not just with Tommy but in the the kiosk and did you find where to buy the other recipes from Tommy I think which which recipes if you talk to him to buy something you hit your R trigger and it gives you another thing to buy like basic items yeah I think I did get that medicine yeah I'm just gonna tell you also save up three wasp nests so you can make a flooring later on the other advantage of going to the islands is that almost everyone that I've been to had a message in a bottle with the new DIY okay yeah the one the one I went to had a new person that wanted to move to my island and I was like okay which by the way I love my default villagers they're so great I got like the perfect I got one oh did you know school I got Agnes and I got Dom Agnes is the black pig and Dom is this like Ram that wears a rainbow shirt and talks about his muscles all the time nice and I got on one of the islands I'm getting chevra who I like one of my favorite are the goats and the guy can't remember his name he's the takoyaki head guy that looks like takoyaki oh yeah and see Brad got BAM and cherry who are like two of my favorites but I need to get Dina I'm gonna order Dina when I can all right Dean is my resident lesbian anyway any other thoughts on that Animal Crossing for for now it really takes the formula and expands upon it and it really it it'd be like I've got to do what to get what but the busywork makes the time fly and gives you so much more to do it and Ed will die Brad I will hit him with my axe in his head until he dies by the way speaking of the axe I highly suggest if you make the full axe still keep a stone axe on hand because you can whack a tree three times with the stone axe and it won't fall over you whack it three times with a regular axe and that you'll lose the tree oh I didn't know that that's good to know I thought it'll give you two pieces of wood and then the tree will die so so state save yourself a stone axe I thought the only way to pull out the trees was to do the whole eat the fruit and use the shovel because one of the villagers taught me that trick or something you can pull it up but if you want to destroy it you cut it down and then dig up the root mmm interesting just like you know before and I'll tell you if you've eaten fruit and you just want to hit a rock without destroying it keep keep a wood shovel you can no but you can also if you eat the fruit and use the shovel on a tree you dig up the entire tree right but I'm talking about the rocks if you're stuff out of it yeah and you've eaten fruit do not use your regular shovel do not use it use use a wood shovel and Bobby says you can replant that tree that's what I used to do in my old villages is I would take you can replant your rocks I would take all the the regular trees and replace them with fruit trees but I'm not sure if that's the smartest idea now because you actually need like wood and things like that for that come from the regular trees so I don't know if that's the fruit trees will give you wood too oh that's good okay but still there are so many trees in game and I actually super like them so the only one now if you hit bamboo if you find an island with bamboo dig up your sprouts you know the little look like little dig spots around them and whack them with the with the stone axe and you'll get two different kinds of bamboo I don't have any crafting for them yet but you'll get different things just stockpile and when you get your house you'll get storage and just stockpile everything don't throw away your cans don't throw away your tires don't throw away your boots yeah you know pansy buds right now talking about all this crafting and everything I think one thing that's important to point out about this Animal Crossing that I think kind of makes it you know a good one is that it's for all the criticism the Animal Crossing series gets of kind of being the same game over and over again I think this one really took the biggest step incrementally above the last game and I think it learned a lot from the popularity of things like Minecraft and Stardew Valley when it comes to things like crafting when it comes to being able to have the freedom to build things outside as well as inside I think it's kind of learned a lot from that and the game is showing a lot of strength because of that I think yeah no I really like that I've you know I liked putting you know bonfires outside I have my my big bonfire on one of the rocks and every time it gets Twilight I light it and then I hear from Dan Gondor calls for aid all right anything else to share about your gaming week Dark Saga okay Loki how about you how was your gaming week I've been mainly playing order that's pretty much it so I'm up to 162 I think and yeah it's just been doing lots of raids and all that fun stuff I think I played a little bit DDR earlier this week and that's pretty much a dig animal crossing have not played it yet my kids have played it and then my wife and my youngest son went back to play the 3ds Animal Crossing and then uh what else I've been looking to put step mania on my arcade cabinet since our DDR machine since I've got time to do that now and so I just was originally I wanted to create my own custom theme which I still probably will at some point but I just want to get something working now so I picked out a theme that looks okay and then I'm just gonna dump songs in it what but I've been fighting my computer the entire week because it just hasn't been working and keeps crashing so I had to reload windows which is a joy and I can't find all my step mania songs I downloaded all this stuff there's like tons of songs somewhere on my 5 terabyte drive and I can't find them so I have to dig those up or just redownload them because hey thank you Comcast taking away bandwidth caps right now so download away that's pretty much it late breaking news of sorts I'm looking in our chat room over twitch TV slash vog network and Bobby Blackwell says off topic but we just talked about this in a previous segment Canada about 15 minutes ago just announced they're not gonna participate in the Olympics if they are held so Canada's put their foot down and said move the damn Olympics basically and that's that that's probably gonna do the trick is I'm sure Canada will not be the only country to put their foot down and say move the damn Olympics you know because it's not just about the Olympics being in this summer but it's about all the qualifiers and things that have to lead up to the Olympics and so I think that's what the problem really ends up being is that you know we may be in a place you know come July or whenever the August I forget when the Olympics are where it might be okay to you know we don't have to worry as much about social distancing by then maybe but it's more like how are they gonna run the qualifiers because that stuff happens months before you picking who goes to the Olympics so very very interesting very interesting update and of course there's always video game tie-ins for the Olympics so if the Olympics get pushed to 2021 you'll still have Mario and Sonic at the Olympics 2020 out there somewhere it's very interesting are they gonna play Mario and Sonic at the Olympics on the Ocho like they're doing today possibly possibly anyway I also see DJ Orwell is in chat reminding us half-life Alex is out very soon in 15 hours so I think there's gonna be a lot of people at least VR enabled people that are really looking forward to that this week I know that's a big big game for all the talk about Doom Eternal and Animal Crossing kind of being the big launches this weekend you know it's still within the same seven-day period as half a new half-life game which is a really big deal as well so I'm really looking forward to seeing what the reaction is to that and how people are enjoying that I don't really have the VR set up to be able to enjoy it myself but I can't wait to live vicariously through others and see if it's maybe something I need to get into for my sometimes half-life obsessed husband we'll see I'll probably have to pick it up just to put it in my backlog to never play like the rest of my scene games now Johnny Wolf a in chat is talking about his gaming week consisting of doom 64 and doom eternal and I gotta say unfortunately I I picked up Animal Crossing I did not pick up doom eternal just because I didn't really want to drop the big money on that right now although I didn't even think to maybe go back and get doom 64 so maybe I will but I don't know um but I was watching our pal Charles over at giant-sized team up was doing a stream the other day of doom eternal and so I was just kind of watching him play it and it does look like fun I got it I gotta say and I really enjoyed the doom reboot that they did in 2016 I think so like I want to get doom at some point but I I just didn't feel the need to get it right away like I feel like I can maybe wait till like a Black Friday sale type of situation but we'll see so but the other thing I'll say about first-person shooters so as we get into my gaming week so a game that I actually played this week and I swear I didn't do this just to get dark soccer to make a noise I played Halo this week legit here's why you better be glad I'm muted here's why here's what yeah I can't hear your eyes rolling when you're muted no but the reality is is that um speaking of doom 2016 I was on Xbox game pass because like Loki I'm thinking about oh we have all this bandwidth now and especially you know I'm not gonna suck down all the bandwidth during the hours that people are trying to work but on a Saturday night or something I might oh let my Xbox one run those 90 gigabytes of updates it's been needing to do for about a year now which I did let it do and I started to kind of look around like what else can I download and doom 2016 was on Xbox game pass I noticed and then I saw a halo the Master Chief collection that reminded me oh I have that on PC and I think they added halo one into that on PC and sure enough they did so I played halo within the Master Chief collection on PC thanks to game pass and yeah it looks it looks really nice and I love playing those games with mouse and keyboard as opposed to controller I mean I like controller but mouse and keyboard feels really good as well and I really like one thing I do really like about halo in that collection is that all you have to do is hit the tab key and it switches between old-school graphics and new-school graphics like without any loading time so it's really kind of interesting to be like no filter filter no and the the difference is pretty stunning actually so that was like a weird kind of thing I was kind of playing with and I thought was interesting taking advantage of you know the Xbox game pass since I have that other games I've checked out this week Animal Crossing of course I don't need to double repeat a lot of what dark soccer has said and because I kind of inserted my own opinion while she was talking about that but I am enjoying it I think it is a big step up compared to the previous games and I I think it's a great thing to have come out right now like unintentionally so like with this irritated as everyone got remember when you were all mad that Animal Crossing got delayed now it's one of those things where it's like secretly I'm with the state of everything that's going on in the world I'm kind of glad it happened now like we needed that game this weekend so that's really great other games that I've been checking out this week I I randomly got back into Diablo 3 I think I talked a little bit about that last week and I've been playing my seasonal character still continuing on in Final Fantasy 14 because of course the game I haven't really touched this weekend which surprises me PSO 2 is in open beta right now and I just haven't jumped on to play it yet I think because with the closed beta it was like you have this weekend to play it and you got to get all this stuff done or you're not gonna get your Dreamcast mag I was like oh I got a Russian and do it but now with the open beta it's like it's running for like two weeks so I'm like oh I I don't really feel the need to rush in there and do the open beta I'll get around to it when I get around to it so that's kind of been my attitude with that on Xbox plus I just updated everything on my Xbox including the PSO client the other night so that is that is something Bobby Black Wolf says I forgot to talk about PSO 2 on my show they haven't given me my Dreamcast mag yet I don't think we were supposed to get that until the game officially launches so I don't think that's supposed to show up until the actual launch of the game which I still don't think they've dated actually but we'll probably know a little more on that soon so anyway that was my gaming week let's move on and get into some of the news what's going on in the gaming world this week so Loki you want to start us off sure so thankfully this week we had Mark Cerny coming to us from the spaceship of love to reveal the PlayStation 5 tech specs so I have some information on those so of course a very similar wise or spec wise to I would say the Xbox Series X of course there were a little bit of differences and they kind of went into some really big details regarding that some of the cool stuff that they were talking about where the fact that with that new SSD that there's going to be very little load time talking about how they're gonna be like deduping the data on there because originally because of the load speeds and where you had your data on the disk it might take longer to access some of that so there was a little bit of duplication to be able to access certain assets on there but kind of overall you know it's gonna be an eight cores into custom CPU they're gonna have the rDNA 2 GPU as well which is kind of similar the PlayStation 5 supposed to run at 3.5 gigahertz and then the GPU pushes a few more teraflops of course he basically said that hey listen you know the teraflops are gonna be a little bit different than what you might see with like an a PC or an Xbox Series X or whatever just based on the custom architecture you know 16 gigabytes is GDDR6 and the internal storage which is kind of weird it's kind of not really a round number but 825 gigabytes SSD it's m.2 NVMe but that is expandable with your own SSDs as well but they're gonna be benchmarking certain ones that are gonna be compatible because of the speed of the system they need to make sure that those SSDs are gonna be fast enough to be able to do what they needed to do for the PlayStation 5 so it was interesting very technical talk obviously something that was supposed to be done during GDC the filming of it with the silhouette so it was a little ms3 3k but I don't know that was odd was interesting yeah yes I kept wondering like I'm like is that like is that real or is that like just like an animated thing it would have been funnier if they were like Sony characters like Oh Nathan Drake is there and Kratos and why is randomly Parappa the Rappa and like all these really odd silhouettes that would have been funny but it was supposed to be a serious talk so you know because clearly it was their GDC talk very clearly it was very interesting to see how again the media kind of hype things up and I'm talking you know as much as I praise and I talk about the independent media this one's kind of on the indie media I think really read way too much into Sony's original tweet and blog announcement because I saw these posts going around about big PlayStation 5 reveal tomorrow and you know who's most guilty of this and I'm calling you out is the youtubers some youtubers not all youtubers but some youtubers were like all big PS 5 reveal event predictions big games being announced tomorrow my game predictions for the PS 5 event y'all fucked up you need to not like put your expectations on the reality of what Sony is saying because that stuff just makes for videos I mean come on it's just it's clickbait set but yeah I get it we all need to be like like and we need like I'm not saying we need to bully people or but we need to say hey you made a mistake and set the expectations way too high you need to be careful about that next time and that's all you know I'm not saying shut them down or anything like that I'm not saying that I'm just saying like you got a little egg on your face if you you you know if you were expecting games games games Sony never said games and y'all have to really like and you can't and again it goes back to what we're talking about earlier in the the show like the whole double sourcing thing if one source is telling you that fine but if if the source says according to a PlayStation tweet that it uh which how many of those sites that post things on Facebook how many of them are according to a tweet or according to an Instagram post that's like so much of what we see right now right so go back and read the tweet for yourself and see what they're really saying because that is all the article says is the 280 characters that's in that tweet and again Sony never said anything about games and so that's why I was not surprised whatsoever yeah I tuned into the talk and in the first 90 seconds Mark Cerny said we have all year to show you games so we'll show you games later and so at that exactly and it was interesting I was disappointed though because he talked about like oh yeah we're gonna have a tear down I was like ooh tear down and then they've never did it so that was kind of point one of the other things they kind of mentioned though because he was talking about backwards compatibility so that is definitely gonna be a focus this time around they were even talking about like game development wise they have the architecture for like the PlayStation 4 stuff available so that you're gonna have a lot of games that could even be built around that kind of architecture still on the PlayStation 5 they did promise he said that they're looking at the top most the one our most popular PlayStation 4 games they weren't aiming to make sure that those are backwards compatible but he says you know that we believe that the overwhelming majority of the 4,000 plus games on PlayStation 4 will be playable on PlayStation 5 so that's pretty cool that is awesome yeah a lot of people kind of reacted to that the thing in his talk about the 100 games but it's good to see that and that was a good thing for Sony to kind of step in and clarify because yeah the way it was worded in there I think a lot of people read into that that oh my gosh there's gonna be barely any game it's gonna be like the rollout of Xbox games on Xbox 360 you remember that where it was like a chunk of them every few months but it sounds like Sony is way ahead of that like when they put out their clarifying statement right yeah so it should be pretty good I think Xbox is gonna be in the same boat because they kind of I don't know I think it's gonna be very similar hardware going into it it will be interesting to see like all this stuff that they kind of talked about during this presentation how that's gonna make a difference and I mean it could make a difference at the end of the day it's gonna be the games so be just how these different developers utilize the hardware that they have this is definitely laying the foundation for that because now when they have their next thing they can talk a little more about games I mean it doesn't necessarily have to be their next thing but on down the road they can really focus on having an announcement that's just about the games you know one thing we should talk about with that GDC talk essentially that was repurposed for YouTube that Sony did we need to talk about Mark Cerny himself for a little bit because I know there were a lot of people on Twitter that were poking fun at him a little bit because he has a lot of mannerisms very similar to Dana Carvey he's very soft-spoken and so forth and so some people were kind of poking fun at that and so forth but um y'all better not forget and I forgot this until someone pointed it out on our discord that badass mother fucker Mark Cerny made marble madness when he was like 17 or 18 so don't you forget it so when you're teasing him saying he's like you know Dana Carvey's impressions or something don't forget he made marble madness which is one of the like that was that was one of the all-time most creative original arcade games it was a badass NES game as well so well where's my ray traced marble game for PlayStation 5 hey you never know you never know he's he's also contributed to other games and so forth but that was just like when somebody pointed that out and you kind of go look at the dude's resume it's like dang this guy made some big contributions to gaming and ended up kind of going to work for Sony on the hardware side like this guy like knows what he's doing because he's been in there programming games and so forth for a very long time and do it doing some of the all-time great games for sure Tiger Claw and chat says if they make a movie about Mark Cerny Dana Carvey should totally play him okay that I will allow that I will allow but let us let us not underestimate how powerful Mark Cerny is as some of his contributions to gaming all right anyway let's move on and talk a little bit about what happened in Nintendo's world this week Nintendo had an indie event so they did one of their indie directs or the indie world showcase if you will where they showed off some of the indie games that are coming to switch over the next couple months or things that were coming out today like exit the Gungeon now I think we knew this game was coming I want to say we had heard about this before but we didn't know it was gonna be the surprise drop on us as of today so exit there as of the day of the the event so exit the Gungeon another bullet-hell dungeon climber but it is following the events of enter the Gungeon so that's pretty cool Loki I don't know if you've had a chance to check out exit the Gungeon yet but I know you were a big fan of enter the Gungeon right I have not checked it out I think it was out on Apple Arcade already and then they're just porting it over to switch I don't know if it's out on PC that's right I think you're right about Apple Arcade yeah now another you know I gotta say there weren't a lot of like indie titles that we knew a lot about there weren't a lot of like big names that were really jumping out but I mean they're Indies so sometimes you don't know that an indie game is gonna really take over like you know Minecraft, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Five Nights at Freddy's they were all indie games too but I thought this was very interesting is that one of the game creators that showed up during this event was Hello Games and their contribution is a game called The Last Campfire Hello Games if you will recall is the studio behind No Man's Sky so it is kind of interesting after everything that that game No Man's Sky went through being a hugely hyped launch on the PlayStation 4 when essentially it was kind of an indie title they got a lot of AAA promotion treatment and so forth and then we saw how that went for them when the game first came out but again and I said this before if you haven't touched No Man's Sky since it first came out it's a completely different game now very similar to what Diablo 3 went through Final Fantasy 14 or Destiny 2 you know one of those games has been really transformed No Man's Sky is right up there so I think a lot of people were kind of wondering ooh what big sci-fi thing might Hello Games do next but it is interesting to note that now this indie studio Hello Games is doing an indie game but I'm looking forward to it because I love No Man's Sky so I'm curious to see what they do their game is called The Last Campfire and it's about a wilderness where there are strange creatures mysterious ruins and you are trying to light the last campfire it's a tale of magic and mystery and it's coming out for the Nintendo Switch this summer so some that was kind of the biggest surprise for me out of this was like oh Hello Games ready to show what they're working on next and it's a little bit more of a scaled back if you will indie title so I'm really excited to check that out on some other things that were announced at the Nintendo indie event Blue Fire from Robie Studios Baldo from Naps Team I Am Dead from Hollow Ponds which I was kind of like ooh I don't know if this is the most well-timed game announcement with all that's going on in the world but it does look like an interesting puzzle adventure game and so forth so that's that a game called Bee Ark or Bark where pugs cats bears and bunnies save the solar system sign me the fuck up that sounds awesome and I love the name Bee Ark bark cyanide and happiness Freakpocalypse part one so I'm assuming that's based on the comic so I love that series so I have to play it yeah so I'm sure yeah some folks will be really excited about that Summer in Mara from Chibig Quantum League from Nimble Giant Entertainment The Good Life from White Owls Inc pixel junk eat pixel junk Eden 2 from Q games Feria from abracam hope I said that right eldest souls from fallen flag studio moving out from SMG studio and sky racket from double dash studios all of that coming out in the next either some of them came out that sky racket actually just came out this week some of those other titles coming up throughout the summer and so forth there's some other titles in there as well apparently Blair Witch from bluebird another Blair Witch game from bluebird team coming out as well and so on many many more and they also announced a new indie focus Twitter account that's pretty cool at indie world and a IND IE world and a so pretty cool hopefully some of you guys looking to check out some of those games quest buster and chat says exit the gungeon just came out but I don't think it's as well received you know it's it it's a orange right says Oh exit the gungeon did seem familiar like it was already announced I guess that's it yeah um it's you know and especially right now in the world a lot of these games are kind of struggling to get noticed amongst everything else going on but I think as this new normal and I'm using my quote II fingers because it's hard to think of this as normal but for the next eight to ten weeks or whatever it might be as this new normal kind of settles in I think we'll kind of get used to these sorts of announcements and things so anyway a different way of doing things moving on Dark Sakura of course you're gonna have an Animal Crossing story right yeah I was actually a little surprised but uh there is a and I might have talked about her before it was this 87 year old lady who had a 3500 plus hour Animal Crossing town her grandson Paul posted this pic this video of her her name is Audrey she's showing off her progress on the 3ds game on you leave she'd been playing every day for four years and of course everyone loves her because she is everyone's Animal Crossing grandmother so it looks like that they based a character in New Horizons off of her Audrey's nickname is Adi and so there's a character in the game now called Adi who wears a cute little blue dress and shades and she's a one of the foxy ones and looks like that's a tribute to this gaming grandmother I love that props to Nintendo for doing that and maybe the little win games do that me too and you know you got to respect your gaming grandmas keep in mind we're all self isolating right now so that our gaming grandmas don't get sick you know it's a big it's a big part of it so has precious it must be protected that's right she's precious do it hashtag do it for Audrey hashtag do it for Betty White honestly we got any whites immortal we got to save the elderly you guys well did you see the PSA that went out by Max Brooks Mel Brooks's son who oh yeah I did see that he's like if he gets sick then Dick Van Dyke and all these others and I was like yeah let's let's be nice and Bobby is pointing out this whole thing is the localization team which I know sometimes localization team that sneaks these types of things in here the Japanese name was something not directly translatable so the US team named her Adi so that's a lot of the Japanese names are nothing that's directly translatable yeah but I do like when there are nods to them like I hadn't seen captain but he was clearly a kappa and Tom Nook would be for a tanuki yeah and just to make sure I didn't misrepresent anything I want to make sure I'm very clear kovat does not only attack the elder elderly they are the most vulnerable but we are self isolating to keep each other healthy as well because this can affect folks in their 40s like me 30s 50s you know we're doing it for each other yeah I can absolutely big batch of people younger and that's why even if you know if it's just pneumonia for me I still can't leave the house oh yeah because secondary infections are really really bad news with that stuff absolutely it was kind of the other way around to remember when you and I had swine flu all those years ago it seems like it was such a memory fucking no I had swine flu yeah we didn't know till after that and and not to compare the two because these are very very different things but the thing was swine flu and when even after I was diagnosed I felt fine I still had to stay home for a week my doctor put me in quarantine for a week because I couldn't catch anything secondary in the whole time and it was the whole time I thought oh she's isolating me she doesn't want me to give it to my class because I was a corporate trainer at the time and I had a class of 30 people no she didn't want the class getting me sick again because that was the dangerous part and I think some of that is in play with kovat but again I don't I'm not a doctor I don't misrepresent anything you don't want it it's not just the flu don't get it if you can if you'll remember after I had swine flu I developed a nasty sinus infection and bronchitis yeah remember I do so if I had known that I had that I would have stayed inside and not gone to eat delicious matzo ball soup that made me feel better all right yeah back to all this we need to protect our gaming grandmothers and the ones that we love and and honestly for everyone who's saying boomer remover I wish you would seriously shut the fuck up these are our parents yeah that's all and it's if you think this thing only targets based on age you need to like read a newspaper or like just literally listen to anything going on right now because we just had an a report of somebody in their 30s in the Hollywood area who went to Disney World you know not again that's the that's the dangerous thing about this like you might go oh my god why did he go to Disney World because he wasn't he didn't he didn't feel sick he didn't look sick he would but he had it and because this thing has an incubation period of 14 days he didn't know and he ended up passing away from it it's really tragic so and I'll just tell people even it this is my last time even if you're not under shelter in place even if you're just only in social distancing please act like you are under shelter in place please you will you'll be doing your part you'll be preventing the spread I'm really surprised that bigger metropolitan areas there are still places in this country that haven't enacted it don't go out like to buy planters or a video game in public or you know don't don't go to a bar or any of that the more you expose yourself the more other people and Bobby Bobby black wolf is saying in chat too late because he openly admitted he went out and got a video game this week but admittedly this is also a situation that's changing day by day like the day you win it like even the night you went out to get the game things did not feel as dire as they are day by day I was we're hearing more and more about like what this thing is really doing so like you know we all probably thought we could take it a little bit lighter than it really is at some point early on I'm sure we've all been guilty of that a little bit but yeah heck I still went on my cruise you know what and I don't know luckily nobody on the shit you know it's today is 14 days since the cruise and there's been no reports of COVID from the cruise so it was everything was fine and dandy and so forth but I certainly make no apologies for that but you know if that cruise had been just a week and a half later I don't think I would have gone so you know timing is really everything really really everything but honestly those airports were way more filthy than the boat was just saying yeah who has that you know who has bad timing hmm my husband for vacuuming while I can hear it through the door well we don't we don't hear it through the on the station for what it's worth so all right anyhow let us move on Loki I think you're next yes that's true so we kind of knew this was gonna happen considering that a Sony made the announcement last week or a medium alcohol I can't remember who was it you'd be able to soon sell some of your creations that you make in dreams well you know all the videos I've seen of dreams online have all benches recreations of other games or like all sorts of copyright infringement stuff so of course there's a lot of Mario games out there and one of the creators goes by the name of piece of craft he had made a Mario game in dreams as well and he's received a copyright strike on the model which basically disallows that game that he made to be played by others in dreams and so the similar type of stuff is happening with some of these other creations that utilize the models similar to that so definitely Nintendo is taking notice of these Mario games that people are making in dreams so you're probably not going to be able to utilize a lot of those copyright materials I would assume that more this would happen with some of the other creations out there because I've seen all sorts of mix-ups with like spongebob and Shrek and all the memes I mean it's really everything it's interesting you kind of talk about that because and even Bobby's alluding to this in our chat right now over at twitch TV slash vog network we're Bobby saying that's because the youtubers only focus on these creations there's a lot more than that in a game and that's very true is that you know again it it gets more eyes and clicks and things when it's like lol it's a spongebob meme inside dreams you know that type of thing gets more clicks than hey here's this person's totally original presentation and how cool it is heck I'm guilty of this as well when the very first little big planet game came out the very first one what did I say was my favorite level the shrine to Parker Posey level is still to this day my favorite thing I've ever seen in little big planet but it was kind of okay like it's like ripping off all these publicity photos of her and things like that I'd like to think at the time it was still kind of a new and novel thing but yeah I mean we got to realize that dreams has a lot more in it than just the copyright stuff but that's the stuff that gets people's attention when it's like oh somebody recreated doom inside dreams what like that gets people's attention whereas you know yeah yeah I mean it's just amazing what you can do with the gaming yeah I know there's a lot of other stuff out there but and hopefully you know that this will they'll go through this and it was just be removed although I mean that's not to say that it made stuff will slip through I mean already the one of the other games that the guy made which was mario 64 HD in dreams is still available to play without the model I guess and I know other games like roblox and stuff like that I mean that's been around forever and there's all sorts of copyright infringement stuff in there like I see my kids playing that and I'm just like how is that allowed it's just it's people catching it so I'm sure this will be the end of it but at least people can know that they are looking for it now and you know we've kind of talked about this phenomenon on the show over the years many times you know whenever you have a game creation software type of thing how long is and this we talked about this a little big planet first came out we talked about this when Mario maker came out how long is it until someone recreates world one one from Super Mario Brothers how long because I mean world one one is iconic because it's something that you recognize just based on that little formula of you know the little the line here and I'm using my I'm making motions for those that are on the podcast and where those question mark blocks are located so I mean that that's level design games so strong in world one one that like you recognize that even when it's being copied in other games just interesting so one of those types of phenomenons so anyway alright um let's move on and talk about a game that valve put out a little while ago called artifact and I think valve actually didn't valve pull this game at some point or they they way scale back on artifact but apparently it may be coming back because dota twos it was a dota 2 based game called artifact it's kind of it's basically their version of hearthstone I mean I know I'm not supposed to say that but you know let's be real hearthstone caught a lot of eyes a lot of people wanted a piece of the pot with that valves one of them so artifact was kind of their response to that but they aren't updating it anymore now okay so the game isn't dead it was the updates that they stopped doing sorry I will I haven't been following the game myself personally but that's what's going on however edge magazine has some inside sources that are saying valve is working on a follow-up internally it's being called artifact tube that doesn't necessarily mean that's what it is could be an expansion could be a new game could be something you know it could be anything Gabe Newell once referred to artifact as an interesting failure they thought it was a strong product saying quote we ran an experiment we got a negative result and now we need to see if we've learned anything from that so let's try again and that's what the artifact team has been doing and what they're getting ready to release based on the reaction to it what was wrong with the product how do we get there let's fix those things and take another run at it of course no information on when that updates gonna come out or the sequel or anything like that but they do say that more details will come out after half life Alex launches which understandable valve is very focused on the half-life Alex thing right now so we'll know a little more information about whatever this artifact thing is at a later date and if half-life Alex is successful then that gets more eyes on steam and a great place for them to announce some more information about artifact whatever the future is for that so fifth dream today in our chat says Wow cards dota cards low cards League of Legends cars guys come on well it's you know and it doesn't stop there Elder Scrolls had their own game The Witcher did Gwent as a standalone game you know a game when a game is extraordinarily popular like Hearthstone or if you want to like Magic the Gathering and all the Magic the Gathering games on the computer everybody wants a piece of that somehow how can we make a trading card game where we're not copying it we're kind of putting our own spin on it and doing so I think that's one thing that everybody wants a piece of I will say for what it's worth I think when a Hearthstone strengths is that it's very simplistic it's not a particularly difficult game to teach and I think the fact that Hearthstone runs cross-platform very easily between tablets and phones completely agnostic a platform doesn't matter if you're Apple Android what have you it sinks sinks that with PC so well I think that's a huge asset for it that I'm not sure all of the other games have been able to copy as well so food for thought anyway fifth dream today follows up and says I'm friends with people very involved in some of the car games online like they work for the companies and streamers and wow it all goes right over my head hype mayhem says to be honest I'm good with car games at the moment I'm happy just playing my Magic the Gathering games on Steam yeah it's something it's like me and MMOs it's hard to play more than one quest buster says honestly surprised that artifact is getting a second pass especially after what its twitch channel turned into but gotta give valve credit for trying well they believe in it and you know games it's not unheard of for games to get rebooted successfully again Diablo 3 no man's sky we've gone down this road a million times this is what happens with games now in this year 2020 so we'll see if valve has any luck with that meanwhile Dark Sakura what else do we have we have me trying to unmute my mic that's one of them no it's taking some getting used to this new setup oh I hate this the site started playing everything automatically it's not streaming through is it no we can't hear it we're only we're only hearing you well it's playing I can't hear it just we're just hearing you we don't hear okay well it's bothering me so I'll go ahead and try to read this while this is playing in the background oh there we go sorry I found it I can't do both sounds at the same time it messes up my brain no you're fine I don't know if Safari is like Chrome but there's like that using Safari I'm on a PC right now oh because Chrome has a little speaker icon you can click it and it'll shut shut it up yeah this it doesn't do it for everything at any well done I have four browser windows open so at any rate it was announced for the World Video Game Hall of Fame that they have their finalists up and ready to go I have already done my voting so the games that are on the list this year are Bejeweled, Centipede, Frogger, Goldeneye 007, Guitar Hero, King's Quest, Minecraft, NBA Jam, Nokia Snake, Super Smash Brothers Melee, Uncharted 2 Among Thieves, and where in the world is Carmen Sand Diego you don't know what I voted for can you only vote for one in that list I think you can go back and vote but I just voted for one which one did you vote for where in the world is Carmen Sand Diego that's a good one if I were to vote in that poll ooh that's a tricky one Bejeweled, Centipede, Frogger, Goldeneye, Guitar Hero, King's Quest, Minecraft, NBA Jam, Nokia Snake, Super Smash Brothers, Uncharted, and where in the world is Carmen Sand Diego I would be very tempted to vote for Nokia Snake but I think I would give it to King's Quest I think I'd have to give it to King's Quest that was that whole Sierra I mean cuz King's Quest to me is representative of the 90s Sierra PC era which and I'm sure Bobby Black Wolf is nodding his head and there's many of you out there that are gonna be nodding your head those games were like formative games for me and the contributions that Roberta Williams and you know everybody that worked on those games is Sierra and so even Leisure Suit Larry Teehee you know though all of that stuff was so important to my childhood that like I have to give it to King's Quest for sure and Carmen Sandiego had a bigger impact on mine I didn't really enjoy the King's Quest games the only real big game on those lines that I played a significant amount of was Luma yeah and you know I it's again it's not a it's not a diss on where in the world is Carmen Sandiego like that game was certainly important too but just for me I put King's Quest ahead of it Loki what about you from that list what would you what game would you vote for to go in the Hall of Fame on that list that's the time I didn't like King's Quest one too much I guess I would say Minecraft or Carmen Sandiego okay I can see my craft but at any rate the voting is going to be going on through the online ballot on April 2nd and I will find the link to post in chat right now but if you go to World Video Game Hall of Fame org that's where everything is listed see and they do have some write-in places as well oh that's good I'm with Bobby I'm more of a Space Quest guy fair enough and a one question about Minecraft if that were to win who gets to accept the award Microsoft or that other guy I would hope the developer well notch is it yeah but I I don't need to hear him give a speech so yeah but it was his creation yeah but I I think I'm fully admitting some of that you know what the Oscars are politics too I suppose in a way but some of that would weigh into my decision on why I wouldn't want to see minecraft get it well they still have a development team I mean that's the folks that should be getting it so also for me it's not that minecraft is minecraft also a little new for me I know it seems really weird to say but I just feel like some of these other games on the list have more of a legacy and we have yet to see what minecraft's legacy is truly going to be we're still like I feel like minecraft is still still a game that is being developed where's that where's that super 4k pack but anyway minecraft is still a game that's on it's never happening never King's Quest 1 is done Carmen San Diego is done sure there's new Carmen San Diego games there might be a new King's Quest games on it but those games essentially are done so that's another thing that really weighs in for me so I mean be mad if you want I'm just telling it like it is so there you go all right anyway let's move on let's talk about the next story which I think Loki is yours so this is kind of fun since everybody's doing those wonderful directs now so humble bundle is gonna be joining the party with their brand new series called the humble brag it's where they're gonna be talking about games and I guess showing some different I don't know deals that they're gonna be doing some of the stuff they're gonna be talking about courses including their own releases because remember they are publishing some games now like them's fighting herds and Temtem the first one's gonna take place on March 24th it looks like at 11 p.m. Pacific Time and March 25th at 2 p.m. Eastern Time so and those are kind of some weird weird times to put those live but I guess we'll have to see more about what this is all about I mean I don't know I don't really have high expectations but neat they might have they might have secured some more like indie stuff because like you said they're doing publishing now which I totally forgot that that was the thing but the them fighting herds that's that one's kind of a big deal that's the one that's like it's my little pony but it's not wink right right and that just came out of early access that's the skull girls folks made that game right or am I crazy I don't remember who made that okay I just know I just know there was a lot of like pony fandom mixed with like school girls mixed with that so somebody in chat maybe can explain the difference to me but I just that oh thank you DJ Rama S it used the school girls engine that's okay I knew there was a tie to school girls in there somehow but it was an independent company okay thank you so I knew there was a tie-in somewhere there they that's why I love doing this with a live chat room because you guys can course correct me when I'm I'm like I remember some of the details but not all of them because an awful lot happens in gaming so all right all right well we'll see what comes through with the humble humble brags I love that name yeah so they're saying though okay so they had a few different dates for the the humble brag presentations although the actual tweet those mentions March 24th at 9 a.m. Pacific time which sends more reasonable I'm not sure why they said there's bring a humble brag presentation will go live and then they have this like long day range so I would say March 24th 9 a.m. Pacific time okay we'll see what they have to announce I guess we'll have something to talk about on next week's show regarding all this all right well meanwhile before we get to the classic game of the week talking about some things you can do right now I mentioned earlier in the show I was using Xbox game pass to check out like Halo and stuff this week and I'm sure some of you guys are using your suddenly open bandwidth connections to download a lot of stuff that you're a little bit behind on well apparently now Xbox game pass ultimate will include bonuses like content in the games themselves and I saw some of this as I was browsing this week they're called perks and some of the initial extras involve cosmetics and characters they're saying a gold ticket mission pass and fantasy star online too I didn't see that though when I went in to look at the perks but maybe that's not gonna happen till the game launches I don't know I did see the ship ornaments in Sea of Thieves and the gods and smite I saw some of that you don't have to do anything extra to enable the perks you just get them through Xbox one or you get them through the beta app on Windows 10 or the mobile app so plenty of ways to get those perks not surprising to hear about that at all that's very similar to what PlayStation Plus has because they have some perks with games as well like I've seen like apex legends stuff and things to tie into PlayStation Plus so it's not too surprising to see Microsoft get on on that too except instead of putting it at the Xbox gold level they're putting it at the game pass level but I think we're all sitting here going it's really just a matter of time before they fuse Xbox gold and Xbox game pass together I think that's coming it's just a matter of when because certainly if you want to buy both and I think the game pass ultimate is both those things combined so a lot of people are getting in on that so anyway there you go let's take a trip down memory lane before you could actually download all these special things you had to have a cartridge if you wanted to play something taking a trip down memory lane every week Dark Sakura steps in the vault and finds a game that she thinks hey you should be checking out this game this week Dark Sakura what is the classic game of the week that you picked for us this week I picked a stinker I picked a bad one I picked safe clued in sets pretty fighter and specifically this one is on the Super Famicom it is a fighting game from 1984 published by imagineer and it is of course a one or two player game it does not go for very much if you find one but it is novel it even did get a sequel called pretty fighter X at some point but basically with this game you are different characters who have different uniforms with a different color and they they have some salacious like content but nothing like cornish you know it's like fanboy service you know but the original game the one on Super Famicom had different characters eight of them that had their family name contained something specific for the color that represented them so we had Aoki Marin was a schoolgirl that wore Pina Blue and she's the main character of the series there's a Shiratori Kris who is a nurse her color is white a Saksa Judy who is a friend of Marin's and she moonlights his athletic dancer and her color is red for Akka there's Kono Keiko who fights an officer here her color is navy blue Kiyori Yoko who is a college student who just wears you know traditional clothing her color is yellow you know kimono by traditional is what I meant Midori Kawa Minami who is a private school girl and wears green Momoyama Ai is a gymnast wears like gymnastics outfit her color is pink Zen Momo like peach and Yamaguki Yawara is a judo wrestler and she wears golden yellow so the game believe it or not it's not like the worst I have played many many bad fighting games in my time it actually is graphically pretty good it the characters are well designed I think the concepts are great it's it's the thing about it being terrible it's really average and when something is average we call it terrible as far as the other ones or you know I don't think that pretty fighter X was that much better I actually have pretty fighter X I I had played it so long ago but yeah it's uh it's pretty average I'm just gonna say that it's I think it's worth everyone playing at least once and you've got some different interesting things like for example you have throws for your characters but you can't throw blocking the hit detection is kind of meh you know sometimes your projectiles won't hit depending on what's going on and you can you know corner block somebody just trap them but it's it's average the characters are decently designed you know if a little stereotypical but it's worth mentioning because I mean this is one of the early all-female fighting games I mean we had the Asuka series you know like Asuka 120% I've done before is a classic game and gals fighter for Neo Geo pocket color so just throwing it out there this could have been one of our originators yeah some people have said it's a very much like some of the Sailor Moon games from the same era well yeah this this particular fighter we're looking at in the video on Twitch right now just straight-up looks like Sailor Moon like it's very interesting well I'm looking up Imagineer to see what else they did the other website is down well and I think it's also just you know even though you kind of highlight this classic game is it's kind of average I think it's still worth noting that you know this comes from an era when everybody was trying to copy Street Fighter you know Street Fighter 2 specifically you know Street Fighter 2 was such a huge game especially when it released on the Super Nintendo that literally everybody was trying to copy it and of course there was the whole fighting street or whatever it was called literally copying it in some ways but you know other types of clones came out and sometimes you know it was like okay make it Street Fighter 2 but like make it for horny boys and that's what this is. I knew the Sailor Moon S game that I had was better than this because it was done by Arc System. I wish I hadn't sold that game it was kind of fun because it had the chibi mood butt smash. I feel like you highlighted that on a previous episode at some point I'm sure you have. But I was like I'm pretty sure that Imagineer didn't do it yeah it was Arc System. And this again coming out of Japan like I remember playing a Dragon Ball Z game I remember playing a Ranma game where I'm a one-half game I remember playing like everybody had to have a fighting game in in this certain like 1991 1992 era like on the Super Nintendo was crazy. But at any rate if you want average then you're gonna try it and it's cheap you know if you're looking for just something that's a little weird but easy to play or if you're just or if you're just horny for waifu fighting there you go yeah waifu fighting yeah get your waifu fight on. I took that from uh victory today all in on waifu dead with legs up yeah it's uh really it's it's ridiculous like charming it's if or you could just recognize how ridiculous stupid something like this is like you know it's like sometimes you just want to watch a bad movie right like sometimes I want to invite Dark Sakura over so we can watch Showgirls and make fun of it because it's a terrible movie and sometimes we want to just play Pretty Fighter because it's stupid right yeah yeah hold on I'm double checking that yeah developer Sailor Moon asks developer Arc System Works publisher Angel Bandai so it was published by Bandai and developed by Arc System there we go all right bam all right there it is your classic game of the week Pretty Fighter for short um what was the full name again Dark Sakura I missed the full name uh fuck let me get it again pretty fighter no I'll get it hold on it is um uh uh pretty fighter as in school uniform legend of course but I noticed even in the the stripper stage with the gargoyles yes podcast folks that was a real thing we just saw on twitch uh you could see in the background the neon sign said pretty fighter in the back so I guess that's the that's the code name that game's adopted so all right not every game is a winner but we highlight uh the games you should check out just because they have a place in gaming history even if it's the not so great part of history all right it was worth a mention it was worth a mention all right uh until our next segment let's move or until our next classic game segment let's move on with this week's show and some of the other segments we have for tonight how's how's my co-host Captain Pikachu doing tonight you doing you doing good you hanging in there all right good all right let's move on it's it's very boring in this giant room with nobody else but this camera it's it's the journey of one man going slowly insane while we watch tonight's program all right well y'all on discord help keep me company let's get to some rapid fire news all right so uh this is the most important feature that's being added to no man's sky and that is bobbleheads that's right so they're going to be adding some bobbleheads into the next update here so we've got uh two they're sold by the quicksilver bot uh the first one being it looks like the specialist polo and then priest entity nada are going to be the two that are going to be starting the game they're going to have some new ones created later on but those will be the two that you'll start off with so that's pretty awesome and even have like this cool little video showing it bobbling as you take off uh the other thing is because you know we're under this whole uh covid 19 situation one of the things that's been affected by that of course is movie theaters and you've seen a lot of these different movies that were just literally released in theaters now coming out um on streaming services so one of these movies that uh came out not too long ago sonic the hedgehog is actually that uh came out not too long ago sonic the hedgehog is actually going to be released on the 31st of march so you can actually stream it to your house for 20 bucks um so that's pretty cool and i know robbie haven't gotten a chance to see the movie is this something that you'd be interested in watching um yeah i want to see it at some point but 20 bucks is a little high for me i mean that is the price of let's say like two movie tickets or i guess in this day and age one and a half movie tickets so the 20 bucks is going to be a great deal like someone in your situation loki where you have a family of four 20 bucks is a deal but for me and i don't think alan is interested in it i mean i guess i'll ask but for me i'd be paying 20 bucks to watch it myself so and my normal brain goes i'll go over to someone else's house and watch it but i guess i can't really do that right now um so i'm gonna i'm gonna just hold off a little bit and see if the price comes down a little bit you know you have a lot of stuff you have a lot of stuff that's going direct to netflix and disney plus especially with the uh uh frozen 2 was just like all right well since y'all are gonna be stuck at home why not we'll just put out frozen two today and then uh what onward like just came out on digital and they've already said it's gonna be on disney plus in like three weeks or something like that so that's two weeks they have a two week window on that and same with sonic so sonic is going to be coming out later on um in may 19th they're going to do the physical release of that and they're also going to digital rentals that might be a little bit cheaper than twenty dollars but i'll do the want to watch it i'll do the digital rental i don't feel like sonic is a movie i'm going to particularly want to own but i'll if it's like a 499 rental sure i'll do that all right so uh there you go so let me move on uh some of the rapid fire stories i have tonight world of warcraft is offering a 100 experience bonus uh admittedly i haven't played wow in a little bit but i thought this was kind of an interesting way to um you know kind of entice people to check out the game while you know folks are kind of housebound at this point um but uh blizzard has mentioned that from now until april 20th so that's a pretty big window um your warcraft character gets winds of wisdom that means you get a 100 XP bonus the buff is available in battle of azeroth legion and starter edition players if you're playing world warcraft classic you signed up for a grind no xp buff for you so that's that's that um now uh of course you can use this to get your characters all leveled up because uh you know there's going to be a new expansion of world of warcraft coming out i think this fall but one thing i think is interesting to point out is that they're offering this whole like level and get there faster but don't forget your character is going to get squished so remember that the level squish is coming so even if you make it all the way to level what is 120 i think it's the cap right now you're gonna squish all the way down to 50 uh but keep in mind the squish i mean it doesn't mean if you level to 50 and stop you'll carry over as 50 it's kind of like a sliding squish like a level 50 character would be what like probably like level 20 or something once the squish happens so do keep that in mind but uh yeah you're you are going to be getting 100 xp but uh there's the squish coming so uh don't get too used to being that high a level uh also in blizzard's world right now they have announced a new overwatch hero uh named echo uh echo is a new character with sound abilities it's a new dps character uh and is it a dolphin is it a echo is not a dolphin echo uses a mimicked hero's ultimate ability as well that is interesting echo is visually and audibly distinguishable from other characters when she i guess i i didn't know echo had a gender but apparently echo is she uh echo uh adopts another form uh she cannot clone the other team's echo though the main weapon is called tri shot so anyway that is all there uh echo is currently on the ptr that part surprised me because my assumption was that no more heroes were coming until overwatch 2 um so i would so she's the team fortress 2 spy i guess yeah i haven't played team fortress 2 in a long time but does the spy clone people's big abilities because that's what echo does don't remember but i know you can look like the other people so maybe admittedly i haven't played overwatch in a little while alan still plays it a little bit um but i haven't checked i he has been playing he's been doing his annual or bi-annual i don't know like playthrough of the mass effect trilogy and when he plays mass effect he does every side quest everything so he just got this weekend to mass effect 2 so i don't think he's touched overwatch in a little bit because he's on that right now so uh fifth dream today says echo equals shang tsung that's not a bad comparison because i believe uh shang tsung had his own abilities but then he could kind of like copy others so that's a pretty good comparison so ss200 matt says she's ditto she can't copy another ditto you guys are on a roll i guess this is a gaming trope we've seen several times before uh but not too surprising all right anyway uh dark soccer how about your rapid fire stories just a couple um so uh for uh people who like free stuff the epic game store is doing uh watchdogs and stanley parable as freebies so go get them um and honestly to be perfectly honest the stanley parable is absolutely worth paying anything so i'll tell you that right now um but yeah go ahead and uh check them out yeah that's one reason i'm glad we highlighted that tonight because uh i think those games are only available for like a week or two so yeah go go grab the stanley parable for sure if you i mean if i realize not everybody's down with the epic store but if the epic store is installed on your computer and it's not a problem for you go get the stanley parable and and why not get watchdogs you might as well right of course some of us already have it on steam and have had it fair but now you'll know what what we love about it um and so also um uh sony is doing uh a kindness it looks like i'm starting on monday march 23rd at 11 59 p.m pacific time so um wow i guess that's going to be yeah late monday um they're releasing both tomb raider and lara croft the the original the 2013 tomb raider and lara croft and the temple of osiris for free on steam um it doesn't does it say how long that's going to be going for um it doesn't say but um they have instructions on the square enix site well looks like it's already up now um but at any rate um you can uh they've got instructions on their site but you go in and you'll buy it for zero dollars and um you go to your my orders you unlock the activation key and you do all the instructions so there you go and if you haven't played the tomb raider reboot yet like you know i feel like that game's been out a while now uh you really should get on it that's that's it's a really great um reinvention of tomb raider i had a lot of fun with it so it's definitely worth your time that time is when it ends sorry oh so you gotta really get on that yeah and then i don't even know if you need to do that because they're free right now on steam because i actually downloaded them already right that's what steam that's what this is about is that they're free on steam until tomorrow right exactly yeah their instructions are really like convoluted it's like a login to your square enix games account and i think they're having people do it on the website so it's done might be convincing people to sign up for a square enix account so that they can send you emails about their upcoming products because that's how i heard about this was i got an email from square enix because i'm i'm a final fantasy 11 and 14 subscriber and i'm pretty sure i used their official store at one point to get like a heaven's word collector's edition of final fantasy 14 or something so um yeah now i'm on the mailing list yeah just skip all that just go straight to steam and just add them to your collection yeah it's easier through the app i think that their instructions were um uh more pertaining to buying it through the website got it all right well let's travel around the world and check out the upcoming releases because uh you know there are still games coming out and especially because so much is digital in this day and age um you know i don't i i do enjoy my physical copies i'm gonna hope that my final fantasy 7 um re remaster or whatever uh re remake i hope the fantasy sim remake i ordered it through amazon so i'm gonna hope it still shows up on the release day uh i did not get the collector's edition i heard there was a whole bump but i'm prepared that it might because yes like many of you i have heard that amazon is shifting some of their priorities and i get it but if we're going to be on house arrest through the end of april then like i'm not in a huge rush like if i get it a few days late i get it a few days late whatever anyway but let's travel around the world and check out what's coming out this week loki all right so we've got half-life alex on pc for vr uh the legends of heroes trails of cold steel 3 on pc bleeding edge on pc and xbox one twin breaker a sacred symbols adventure on playstation 4 and on some system called the playstation vita we have vampire the masquerade coteries of the new york and that's going to be on the nintendo switch yugioh legacy of the duelist link evolution on pc playstation 4 and xbox one also vampire the masquerade coteries of new york on playstation 4 one piece pirate warriors 4 on pc switch playstation 4 and xbox one saves row four re-elected on nintendo switch and last but not least under night in birth exe colon late what kind of names are these arc system works that's on pc you know something that's on my list for the us for some reason is cooking mama cook star i don't know if i heard that but that is out this week on the switch it's important no i i did not say that like that's what we need right now is mama to fix it because we've got a fucking mess going on we need mama to fix it so anyway something to think about all right well i'll travel to japan here uh and check out the japanese releases of which uh there's just a couple things this week on the switch one piece pirate warriors 4 is out this week revenge of justice is also out and on the nintendo switch space invaders invincible collection i have no idea what that is it looks like there's a whole like it comes with a space invaders switch game uh and a whole bunch of like little collectibles thing and keep in mind the space invaders phenomenon like that a lot of that was japan like there was it was huge there it's it's really a part of their culture um it does come with the space invaders original from 1978 it comes with space invaders part two space invaders 91 and space invaders extreme that's pretty cool as well as space invaders dx space cyclone lunar rescue and apparently more to come with that so that's a pretty cool collection i wonder if that's coming out here in the states at some point but the space invaders invincible collection is coming out this week in japan on the switch now looking at the playstation 4 real quick we see a lot of overlap because revenge of justice is out there as well as well as one piece pirate warriors 4 that's basically just collection not out on ps4 though but playstation 4 does also have uh keniro lover ishi is coming out this week and life is strange 2 getting its japanese release yes i know that game's been out here in the us for a bit but the japanese release is finally happening this week a multi-language edition so i imagine some localized acting for japan um how about the uk dark soccer uh sure um we have on the 23rd we have bleeding edge um for xbox um on the 26th we have playstation hits lego batman 3 beyond Gotham and injustice 2 rereleases and mad max mad max is kind of funny um uh on also on the 26th we have one uh piece pirate warrior 4 we have lego marvel collection fishing sim world pro tour collector's edition grand blue fantasy

us emails but you can also tweet at us at olr um and we're on facebook as well though admittedly i haven't posted there in a while but we do have a little community there and yeah the last email we have is from tumblr where have you been uh been a little busy been a little busy all right so you can send us an email for a future week if you'd like participate at orange laundry.com but i understand a lot of you have had your minds in other places this week anyway let's move on and uh to our next story loki all right so uh we were just talking about some free games and so of course it's nice to see that there's some more free games you can play um steam is doing this the steam game festival spring edition between now and the 23rd and with that you can test out uh 59 games that are part of their kind of indie showcase um so these were some from indie mega booth wings fun indie mix data devs and you can check them out uh some of the more notable ones i saw in there let's see here there's a long list um i don't know there's some pretty cool games like uh skate bird that was one that was pretty cool i know i've been following them on twitter um what was the other ones uh there's a game called coffee talk kung fu kickball clang 2 uh giant silent bob mall brawl um that's kind of interesting and yeah so lots of uh different demos you can check out um granted you want to do it sooner than later because you know time is running out but i imagine that more these types of things are going to be available i know there is even a curated list that someone did of um different games that have been available and like even all these different game jams are going on they have one about uh the whole covid19 stuff about staying inside and um there's a pretty funny one about feeding animals at a park and you're this old guy and you have to feed the animals the right food and then if they get too uppity on you you hit them with your stick so i thought that was hilarious um so yeah check it out um you know lots of different free games even on hiio and stuff but uh this would be a cool place to check out some of these indie games that were shown off and some of these festivals that actually been closed coffee talk the game neither about coffee nor talking discuss no i actually don't know what that game is about but uh i couldn't help but think of that since we're gonna bring up saturday night live on this show old school from the 90s dana carvey and then mike myers and coffee talk so all right um i will have to check out some of the games i had no idea there was a jay and silent bob game in that expo i have to check that out yeah i'm assuming that ties in with the new movie which i did get that chance to watch the movie this week and uh it's okay it's it's all right all right all right well let's move on and uh talk about uh this samsung story so samsung uh is actually going to be closing their pc to mobile service uh samsung is um uh and it kind of strikes a chord right now because i feel like nvidia has like a similar thing going on i mean i know it's not pc to mobile it's like a different thing but i feel like a lot of these things are under the microscope right now but samsung is going to be closing their service on march the 27th so uh play galaxy link allowed you to play pc games on your phone um so they are shutting down the game streaming service on uh march 27th sadly they didn't say why just internal policy changes but i couldn't help but wonder if some of the stuff we've watched is happening to in video with something i wonder if some of that was coming into play i don't know but they didn't confirm or deny any of that they're just saying they want to more effectively refocus its resources um also of note samsung has also noted that they're teaming up with microsoft on a game streaming experience that'll show up later in 2020 could it be that samsung is somehow involved with xcloud or something along those lines we have yet to see but that is something that is uh looking like it could be in the um future for samsung but for now their current service is going to be going away um moving on to talk quickly about a third-party app that actually will make your smartphone into a virtual joycon so let's say you uh lose your joycon or you want another one or something like that it's interesting uh there's apparently an app out there and right now it's only on android but who knows if it's allowed to stick around maybe it'll show up other places too uh the android uh phone has a game call or an app called joycon droid and it will allow your phone to be a virtual joycon um it'll work but it's probably you know again keep in mind the actual joy cons have a lot more tech inside them that your phones don't actually have so while it might help you like have a buzzer in a game or something like that i wouldn't really want to use this to play every game but it's it might work for animal crossing heck so there is that all right just a couple more stories for you guys before we get to uh listener round table which tonight is just going to be exclusive to our chat room so if you have questions you might want to start putting those out in our chat room uh so like i was going to say with that whole joycon thing that's a pretty good idea just for like even like mario party or something like that so you have your friends over and like you don't want to buy 80 you know pairs of controllers so you just have a joycon for each person just grab a bunch of phones and set it up that way well you know one thing that missed our show world tonight was the whole uh intellivision trailer that came out so intellivision put out a new trailer right bobby talked about this on his show a little bit and i'd seen the trailer earlier in the week and the whole like controller via smartphone app i believe that's something intellivision confirmed they want to do so that way you know because they're trying to be very big on multiplayer gaming in the same room uh family game night type of things and it would make a lot of sense like oh hey i only have two controllers you know what instead of charging families money to go buy an extra controller well they can do that if they want for the collectability or whatever but you can use a smartphone maybe if it's something that you aren't gonna use very often or something like that so it's kind of interesting it's like a similar idea that's kind of baked into the system and then of course you can't help but think about jackbox party pack where i feel like the whole smartphone controller thing really started i mean sure i think we've always had mods and and all these types of things but i i feel like that really took off with jackbox party pack which those games are having a real i don't know if you guys have noticed but i noticed those games are showing up everywhere right now um with this situation a lot of friends of mine um staying in touch by playing those games over the internet since they're so easy to really pick up and go so kind of interesting all right well anyhow let's move on uh loki you got another story for us before we get to listen to round table yeah so this is interesting so uh we had of course the whole reveal of some of the specs of the xbox series x last week and then of course this week we then get major nelson putting out a tweet about a release date now he said that you know an xbox product page in some regions um you know originally they had uh said there was showing a holiday or a thanksgiving 2020 release of course come to find out that's not necessarily true he's actually clarified that it's just holiday right now so whoops we accidentally uh put a release date where there is none so i mean i'm assuming it'll come out around that time but it hasn't been confirmed yet yeah i think it's one of those things where people are reading into it nobody's gonna launch a console on a holiday like that and even even with the controversial stores being open on thanksgiving and that whole stuff like they're not they're not gonna launch a console on that day but i think that gives you an idea oh that's around the time frame which of course it's around the time frame they're gonna launch the console uh almost almost big almost every console has launched in november one of the big exceptions of course being the switch which launched in the spring um but it looks like microsoft is still targeting that fall holiday time frame and kind of confirming that in light of everything that's going on in the world with covid now um it could still get pushed back i wouldn't be shocked at all if something like playstation 5 or xbox uh x gets pushed back to spring next year even further back depending on what's happening but um you know uh that's certainly what they're aiming for and i don't think that's a huge surprise right and that could have been the original plan that it was going to be thanksgiving but uh or around that time but you never know with the way supply chains are now and with everyone not working because of everything it's it's hard to say i mean it's still a wait we'll see there's still a long way to go to see kind of like what the the where all the cards kind of land and it really just depends on how long does this go on you know so we'll see all right well moving on to talk about uh google stadia and kind of the first discount for google stadia for the hardware and i'm using my quotee fingers because again i think we all know generally the the actual concept of stadia is that you're not going to need hardware for google stadia you'll be able to play it in a browser but the google stadia starter pack has gotten a discount so uh and it was just in time for doom eternal which is something that you can play on stadia if you like so uh it was just a one day i think it was today or it was earlier this week uh was the sale so i'm not sure you can still take advantage of it unfortunately but it's still worth highlighting because it is a sale already on stadia hardware so just take that what it is but they had knocked down the price to 99 instead of 129 and that was the controller the chrome cast ultra and three months of stadia pro so um i don't know if anybody took advantage of that because of doom eternal or if anybody's been playing uh doom eternal on google stadia but uh that is available so i'm still curious to see what happens with a um you know browser launch and kind of the launch for stadia for other platforms i got a chrome cast uh or excuse me not a chrome cast a chrome book that's not doing a heck of a lot right now uh it's pretty much an electric blanket for mr smoosh so um i would be very curious to see what stadia would look like on a system like that because you know that's where i think the street you know because obviously those things don't run a lot but if stadia is mostly streaming it might kind of look games might look pretty good on there for for certain things so we'll see but i imagine everything that's going on in the world again has google reassessing a lot of those types of things and some folks in chat commenting on uh yes mr smoosh was getting picked up in the background because uh his other dad decided that now is a great time to open up one of those smelly cans of food and so smoosh comes running because he smells the food uh and uh yeah as 200 matt saying smoosh has thoughts on that topic he thinks the xbox should be released on thanksgiving so he can eat some turkey while everybody is playing the new console yeah fair enough fair enough all right well uh this is the part of the show where we would get to the listener round table uh if you guys have questions in chat for us go ahead and ask them over at twitch tv slash vog network uh for tonight we are going to forego discord because we're using discord to connect us uh to the show right now um so we're going to forego that for now but if you do have general questions or comments you can put those in our chat room and we'll be reading some of those on here uh pod culture in chat says bring smoosh on cam uh i would love to but that requires me leaving cam to go get him and he just dug into his food he's not gonna want to leave that he'll be very unhappy if i take him away from that so you're gonna sadly have to give him a little while and the show will probably be done by the time he's ready because you know he has to chow it all down and he's gonna be you know he's gonna sit down and be fat for a little bit then kind of go over and drink a little bit of water and all that good stuff so anyway um i don't know if you guys have any last minute stories while we wait and see if anybody's got questions or comments for us in chat um sure i do so uh since of course everybody is canceling all sports uh one of those sports that's been affected by that is formula one and so because of that formula one has announced that f1 esports virtual grand prix series is going to be a thing that happens this year and with that they're going to have a number of the current f1 drivers playing the official codemasters game f1 2019 and on pc in having that broadcast worldwide in lieu of the races that's kind of neat um and bobby was talking a little bit on a show about i don't know if it was this or something similar but apparently there was some racing esports on tv today because today was supposed to be a nascar day and it's kind of kind of an interesting situation with the world that we're in all these sporting events are getting cancelled so what are the tv stations going to show uh and so some i'm sure some are doing movies of the week and so forth but uh some are showing esports events so if you can't do nascar why not do e nascar i think yes and then as bobby's putting it uh espn 2 is doing the ocho so they had a lot of um crazy different events in there i know uh one of the like marble racing that they do on youtube was one of the things that they are showing in there they're the tetris uh championships i want to say they were doing like some sort of eating contest at one point axe throwing or something i don't know it's all sorts of fun stuff almost makes me wish i had espn uh and nascar's was the i racing was the name of that game that they were um doing on uh tv um here's a comment uh from chat uh or question act deaf says i got a question with this quarantine taking place do you think twitch streaming will now be something that people start doing now well not only twitch but you get the idea um absolutely um i think twitch is a very interesting way for people to kind of keep in touch um i also notice our numbers for viewing are up slightly tonight i mean not a ton but they're up slightly tonight because all the usual things that we're up against such as sporting events uh and so forth are are cancelled um i'm you'd be surprised i'm not happy about that because i kind of like the way the world used to be um i understand why we're in this scenario and so forth um so i guess i'll take it but um yeah i think more people are drawn to twitch because people are making original content out of their homes um and i think there are a lot of big personalities out there and so forth where when you know the with when to create content for twitch or youtube or a lot of stuff all you really need is yourself and a camera you don't necessarily need a big uh film crew to be able to make that kind of stuff so i think that space is where you're gonna see content now that doesn't mean it's all gonna be good content because i talked earlier about the youtubers that blew the sony stuff way out of proportion and that's part of what i think we're gonna miss about the professional filmmakers and the professional stuff is that that kind of quality level not to say the indie stuff is bad i would not want to shoot ourselves on the foot like that but there is a certain type of uh quality process we'll say that goes with that professional caliber of uh streaming and television production and so forth that i think some of us will start to miss the longer that this goes on but um television survived the writer's strike it'll survive this too um not everything survived the writer's strike though remember remember the tv shows heroes when it was good yeah uh i know you know it's funny i watched the uh show on netflix actually this week called freaks that kind of reminded me of like a pilot for a hero type show it was actually pretty cool so hey that's something you guys could watch you know it says uh everyone's got a lot of free time now i guess um some other great questions from chat sia tabiri is asking where in the world is carmen san diego was mentioned in the convo about the hall of fame topic uh any thoughts on the best carmen san diego tv series adaptation where in the world versus where on earth the cartoon versus where in time the tv show uh later one i know it's a tangent but it's a fun conversation i have to be honest i haven't really seen the netflix specials so the only thing i know of when it comes to television and where in the world is carmen san diego is the old pbs game show uh with the the the rockafellas singing the theme song and all that stuff and i i i i don't go ahead i played a lot on a map on the first mac came out in 1984 i played a lot of it and then i played where in time where in time for me was more fun because it was history too um sia tabiri is curious about the tv adaptations though if you have a particular favorite i didn't really watch much of any of them i would just do the themes go do my day yeah i think i watched the original like um the carmen san diego show i don't think i've seen where in time but the original was all right yeah uh yeah i like the game show it was a lot of fun i like pbs had a lot of really good shows in the 90s but that just might be you know my my kid slash teen voice coming through i don't know uh what do we get in the twitch marathon of like three two one contact and stuff like all that like nothing is off the table for how people are going to resolve their boredom so stay tuned anyway um let's see uh quest buster says as a tangent on the streaming note more people are definitely heading online to play steam logged its highest number of concurrent users last week if i recall correctly yeah we had a story about that briefly last week that steam reached an all-time high and they're probably gonna keep those numbers are gonna keep going up and up unlike the stock market wamp wamp but yeah those numbers are probably gonna keep climbing um let's see uh s200 matt says the entertainment industry will bounce back some of your local businesses may not yeah it's a very um very real prospect um so you know those of you that have the income to be able to spend on things like local businesses i hope you're planning to do so when those businesses open back up or if they're serving food to go right now those are great places to support um so i was going to mention real quick about the twitch traffic so they are saying that um overall year over year there's been a three percent increase in new accounts on twitch and then 15 increase over the last few days of streaming on twitch wow i'm not surprised this is the time where people pick up a new hobby and things like that you know and that's uh to pass the time and i'm i'm all for it you know somebody we might have some great new voices out there that uh haven't been heard yet that will be through all this um tiger claw mentioning the funny thing is i've been doing the whole self-isolation thing for years with friends living in another state and some relatives in another city i've been alone for most of my life so if i wanted to play games with someone i can only be via online you know and that's a running gag if you will i'm using my quotey fingers since i don't know if it's really a gag but that this is the moment that introverts have been preparing for is kind of like a line that i hear around uh the internet and you know again i don't i don't want to be insensitive or rude but i definitely think there are like some personalities that are totally okay with like what's going on right now and that's or you know what i mean like are able to adapt easier we'll say that because like like you said tiger claw that this is something you're kind of used to anyway um this is this is a challenge for me i'm gonna be honest this whole thing is it's hard because i'm a little bit more extroverted by nature i like to be around go out with people do stuff on the weekend even if it's just i'm going out to a restaurant with alan and even if it's just us or meeting one or two other people like those are the types of things i like to do and like i know we're only a week in barely but i can kind of like already feel it i'm like dang this is if this goes on for eight weeks it's gonna be hard um i've already been this way for a week yeah honestly it's been beautiful yeah but that's right but that's your personality and my personality i'm saying yeah the thing is is that now it's kind of like what introverts go through in reverse or what people with autism like me go through in reverse you're now in our comfort zone and it's been i don't really have anything to offer people in those circumstances other than that i think that for some of us who are more adapted to this kind of thing we need to be there for the people who aren't i think that's fair so um anyway uh where else i'm looking some folks are talking about i knew somebody that was on the carmen san diego game show it's kind of fun uh fifth dream today says yeah my life definitely less impacted than most because i have social anxiety or other reasons i just stay home as much as possible sure um oh she hulk says support your local podcast as well like olr with some biddies thank you so much for that she hulk really appreciate that um s2100 matt says i do hate the narrative that was floating around that this whole thing was karma to jocks with sports being cancelled what bothers me is that plenty of people who work in sports that aren't jocks or are gamers like everyone else um here's the thing with all that stuff you know and i've heard the crap about boomer doomer and all this other bullshit as well let's keep something in mind human beings have the capability of discriminating viruses don't discriminate and y'all better keep that in the forefront of your mind as to why we're all doing this whole self-isolation and all this stuff i mean yes maybe the statistics are showing that less younger people are um being as severely impacted but that doesn't mean every everybody who's young is immune because this virus doesn't discriminate viruses can't discriminate you know any sense so and if i may jock and boomer also it doesn't fucking matter when it comes to a virus yeah please and for everyone complaining about the shelter in place you know people can still get their necessities they can leave for those things but i want to put this into perspective um in fact someone actually just posted this on twitter and i'm going to steal it and frank lived in a practical closet for two years you can endure the next 10 weeks yeah i i you know i i'm gonna sit here and say it sucks but i'm gonna recognize it's what has to be done and i'll get by you know luckily i have a show like olr to kind of be an outlet of sorts you'd think i would be doing more personal streaming but i'm gonna give you a very honest answer on that um you'd think i would do more personal streaming but kind of like the opposite effect is kind of happening is that because i'm not really able to go out and be social i can't really get the energy to do that during the week as well olr is kind of the type of thing where i've been doing it every week for so long it's like it's just like a habit like it's like it's it's like ingrained into my dna right now at this point um this show is old enough to fucking vote pretty much uh so that's you know kind of like where where olr is at but like when it comes to like the impromptu streaming stuff like it's not as easy for me to do that so that's why i'm being very supportive of like other people who are thriving in what's going on right now you know like dark soccer to use you as an example you've kind of said that and you streamed for the first time in quite some time a couple days ago and you kind of have more a desire to do that and so i kind of see my role right now as because i am having a hard time and i've got to use my energy focusing on not going crazy um i support dark soccer and what she's doing and i support all of the rest of you that want to go out and create content so um other comments in chat um fifth dream today says by shelter in place they mean stop waving your dick in public going you can't tell me what to do and you don't need to buy a car new shoes and have a wedding this week yeah all those things will be waiting for you uh in the summertime hopefully um s2100 matt says i went for a senior drive yesterday i wanted to do something that was wasn't around people but also got me out of the house i love driving uh i find it relaxing so a nice scenic drive filled that void i needed yeah uh and that sounds like a great i might try to do something like that next weekend but the the only challenge i see with that is that i also think a lot of those places where people would usually go like let's say the established trails and things like that are probably going to be very busy and it's going to be very hard to do social distancing at places like that but i know in your case i think you said you picked more of a random type of place to go to and that probably worked out a lot better um i have been like going to the parks nearby i'm trying to go out once a day to walk around the park i wasn't successful with that every day last week but maybe i'll do better this week uh trying to go just like do a lap around the park and so forth so i'm getting a little vitamin d every day and then like i went out to the bigger park i live near just to like go play ingress and it's weird because like right now i could really give a shit about ingress and like the the whole fielding and the scoring and the who's gonna throw a megan on i i don't give a shit because there's more important things right now but yet i did find some odd little comfort that like the uh park near me was kind of blue and i was like oh this gives me a little something to do and i can keep six feet away from other people while i do it okay i did my thing i got outside i got my vitamin d i'll go back home now so and rob yeah i can't do those things oh yeah yeah i'm going out to check my mail is the most i go outside and that that makes perfect sense i mean and when i was going through the swine flu thing years ago it was kind of a similar sort of thing but it also helped in that situation to know it was only for a week and this might go on a lot longer but you know hopefully um yeah i don't know when i'm going to get better or when i'm going to hear from my doctor they're not seeing anybody in person they're doing as much to treat people over the phone or um by email and keep people out of the hospitals yeah because with all the people who could possibly have this disease in the hospital they want to keep the hospitals free for that but yeah there's a covid doesn't stop everything else that could go wrong you know i could still have an accident at home where i slip and break my leg and it's gonna you know it's gonna be gonna be rough so they're gonna be like learn to split bitch yeah right so yeah all right we'll mail you some coding here you go yeah all right well anyway um for now i think we'll go ahead and kind of wrap up with that uh unless loki i don't know if you have any other last minute stories you want to mention before we wrap up here um yeah i was gonna say there's a few more games that are free right now so you should check uh check them out on steam uh the first one being droffle 2 is free until april 10th and goat of duty is free until march 31st so go check those out sorry for the silence i was answering a question in chat there so all right yay more free stuff maybe there'll be even more free stuff in the next week who knows we'll see so um all right i think with that we will probably wrap things up for the night here uh at the voice geeks network and here at orange lounge radio but we will be back in seven days to do it all again uh as far as we know at least until at least until early april the show is probably going to be like this for a little bit so um hope you guys enjoyed it nonetheless even though we weren't all in the same room but i think we were still able to bring you a lot of the stuff that you would expect from a usual edition olr um but let's go around and get everybody's final thought before we wrap up for the night uh dark soccer do you have any final thoughts to leave our folks with tonight i would like to be able to speak without being winded very much well thank you for um going through the show tonight but do i mean hopefully in seven days this isn't as much of a problem but do feel if you need to go like go like take care of yourself don't don't do the dumb thing i did and make my make my strep throat worse by hosting two shows over valentine's day weekend which i still have a cough from because of that and every time i cough like i feel the looks coming on when i'm at the park or something like that so well i've been i've been taking it pretty easy dan's gotten used to reading my my gestures that aren't all you know a single raised digit and we've got fresh bread it was honestly breaking baking bread last night set me off which is usually a stress relief for me because you know i get to beat the crap out of some dough and it's delicious when i'm done it's still delicious don't get me wrong but i was a mess afterwards just baking bread so all right well everyone take care of yourself listen to the signs ret let's listen to doctors uh rest up feel better and uh we'll hope we'll hope when we talk to you in seven days you're doing much better okay thank you you're welcome uh loki any final thoughts tonight i just found out that apparently you can use the toilets in animal crossing that's interesting i guess you actually always been able to use the toilet since the first one yeah but he didn't but i don't believe in every single game he's like and that takes care of that with the flushing they've always had the flushing that's funny that takes care of that that's funny um i need a super toilet now yeah and actually spoiler alert one of the early rewards you get is toilet paper it's almost like animal crossing foretold the future why do you talk to me like this all right y'all really added toilet paper like for real no i was smart bought um an extra pack before things got crazy although we were getting low on paper towels so i had to get some industrial paper towels and so i got these really weird looking brown things that you would normally find in like an office calm oh yeah dan's actually still been uh dealing with his mom's place and there was a stash of toilet paper paper towels and cleaning supplies nice yeah so yeah and i i heard some of the stores restocked today so i think and i think people are calming down a little bit so hopefully that stuff is not going to be as well they're also putting like restrictions on stuff and i know like when i went over i had to go grocery shopping this week and so when i went there they're training tons of people to do the you know picking orders for the pull up and drive up and delivery and um it's still over out of like everything but i'm assuming that eventually it'll get better once they're not letting everybody just run rampant and take everything i will say this too for people who are having a hard time getting some things if you have a asian markets near you um mexican grocery stores uh indian markets those are actually amazing places to get meat um you know you might have to be a little bit more for either kosher or halal at some of the places um middle eastern markets for example but those are great places to stock up on some things and i have seen the uh paper staples there as well so you know just might not have ever been in there might look a little different than what you're used to but they're good places to look for these things yeah you know how i live in kind of like a very korean part of town like all the korean shops and restaurants around here apparently oh yeah go to the smile market yeah apparently over at smile that's like the place you can still get toilet paper so i thought that was kind of interesting at least that's what they said on next door now that that came out though it's probably gone because usually when i think to go to the korean market i go all the way to the gigantic they have this place called kp plaza for those that you know don't live here uh which is like two supermarkets because it literally used to be like a ralphson another supermarket it's two supermarkets fused together that is like nothing but international stuff and that's where i usually go when i want to go to like a korean or a i'll just go to the huge one that's like everything the united nations of food except i was very disappointed when i went there last time i could not find stroopwafel when i was there i have to go to the but that's getting more and more popular at the regular store i found i found stroopwafel just a save mark the other day also places like home goods ross um marshall's owns home goods on tuesday morning they've actually had things like pasta um packaged non uh non-refrigerables um you know like i found like some good indian food and rice and i found truffle pasta at home goods um they have seasoning and spices there rob they have coffee at um your k-cups perfect um so people may not think of those places but totally look at those places um you're if you've got a cost plus world market near you go there they've got coffee and tea and international stuff and sausages and things so think outside the box if you're running out of your staples just saying all right well i think with those uh notes my final thought uh because i have to say it at some point would be if you enjoyed uh orange entre do don't forget to uh help us spread the word we are the show where every gamer has excuse me i have the hiccups where every gamer has the hiccups where every gamer has a voice but we can't get those voices out there um if the folks don't know we're here so help us spread the word uh tell a friend or or a few about the show those auto hosts on twitch are awesome and we really appreciate all those of you the auto host us i can't read the names of who does it every anymore because twitch doesn't show me that anymore but just know that we appreciate you and that's a great way to get the word out is through the auto hosting um and yeah nice five star review on a site like itunes or wherever you found this podcast just sharing the spotify link or anything like that all of that goes an awful long way i have the last bit the last bit of uh breaking news here right apparently harvey weinstein has tested positive for coronavirus in jail oh oh i heard that that was a little earlier so and uh ran paul how is it too couldn't happen to better people i i don't know why my brain immediately went to harvey firestein no god no no no and i got really concerned for a minute i was like no please but then when you said harvey weinstein tried to come for tom hanks i mean harvey weinstein i was like oh whatever for the record uh tom hanks posted today that he and his wife are doing a lot better and has been using that uh his uh his uh platform to uh to you know encourage others and show them what to do during this situation but the problem with um with wine is that it indicates a wider spread at rikers so oh yeah so just keep that in mind although fucking karma it's the the testing being unavailable means a lot more people have this than what's being reported i mean just look at what's happening amongst the famous people it's adrice elba daniel dae kim um what's her name from the old madonna movies debbie maser uh you know a lot a lot of these folks have it and you know like what you know a lot we we hear about them because they usually i mean a lot of them go out of their way to say i didn't do anything special to get a test or whatever but a lot of these guys you know can get testing a little easier so i think we're hearing more about it so um yeah anyways just it's just kind of scary but just that this is why we're staying home you know uh don't let's let's try to end this thing by not spreading it to anybody else so all right on that note we're gonna wrap up enjoy playing games catch up on your backlog get some more weeds picked in your animal crossing town kill some more demons and doom eternal however you are spending uh the time this week have a good enjoy half-life alex you vr fans i want to know all about that one uh so
