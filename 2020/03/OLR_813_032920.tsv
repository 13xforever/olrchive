0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	17000	Nearly three decades later the game with no conversation dialogue
17000	21000	The original quarter eater Dragon Slayer is going from movie video game to video game movie
21000	23000	I'm hoping for a space age successor
23000	27000	This is just one story, join us for the rest starting right now on the show where every gamer has some space
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
37000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 813 of our program for March the 29th of 2020
45000	49000	My name is Rob Roberts and as we talked a little bit about last week
49000	51000	And as I'm sure you're well aware with everything going on in the world
52000	57000	I am all alone in the studio this week as we are practicing social distancing
57000	62000	Which is a pretty good idea in the state of the world today
62000	64000	Pretty good thing to be practicing
64000	68000	Not joining us at all tonight though sadly DarkSakura or Jamie Summers
68000	73000	Talked to her yesterday a little bit via text because her voice is not holding out so well
73000	77000	She was having kind of a rough night last night so she decided to bow out of tonight's show
77000	79000	Just to let her voice recover a little bit
79000	82000	Completely understand if you've been listening to the last couple weeks
82000	84000	She's been battling something kind of nasty
84000	89000	We don't know what it is because is it the big one? Don't know because testing is not there for it
89000	91000	But regardless we're wishing her well
91000	93000	I did check in with her about an hour ago
93000	97000	She said she was doing a lot better today but still wanted to rest her voice for the night
97000	98000	Which is certainly understandable
98000	102000	Who knows she might pop in to our chat room at some point throughout the night
102000	105000	Because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network
105000	111000	vog network dot com that's vog network dot com or on twitch twitch dot tv slash vog network is where we tape
111000	117000	Every Sunday night at 6 o'clock pacific 9 o'clock eastern ish right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
117000	122000	Even though DarkSakura is not here tonight I am joined via discord by tech master Loki
122000	123000	Hello Loki
123000	125000	Hello I'm here
125000	130000	You are here how are you how are you holding up after how many days is it that you've been in the house now
130000	133000	For me it's coming up on 14 days tomorrow
134000	140000	Um yeah because I was working from home as a week from last Monday so yeah it's been two weeks
140000	144000	Yeah so yeah pretty much the same so well glad you're hanging in there
144000	149000	Hopefully a chance to play some games and maybe get caught up on writing your own game
149000	155000	Um I would have let no I've had time no time to do either of those
155000	159000	And the reason for that is I've been dealing with PC issues
159000	165000	And so I my laptop does not want to cooperate with two monitors I have
165000	170000	And so it's it keeps crashing I've been just dealing with that all week
170000	177000	And so because it clearly is not working and I think the graphics card may be going out on it
177000	182000	It works fine by itself so I got a replacement coming
182000	188000	All right well glad you at least have a replacement coming hope it makes a decent amount of time
188000	192000	Because I know they're prioritizing the essential stuff right now so it's
192000	194000	Oh no it'll be here like tomorrow
194000	200000	Well that's good that's good I'm looking at some of the chat room comments over at twitch.tv slash vog network
200000	204000	Where fifth dream today is saying the mouse is looking at me plushplosion
204000	208000	Okay so those that are watching live on twitch have the visual
208000	214000	And I haven't plugged this in a while so I should say if you are a subscriber on twitch at vog network
214000	221000	Which you can use your if you're an amazon prime person you get you may not know this but you get one free twitch subscription every month
221000	225000	So if you want to use that on vog network you get access to our video archives
225000	230000	The podcast audio version is free just as it has been for over 18 years
230000	236000	Or not quite over 18 years over 17 years coming up on 18 years like I'm getting at that point where I forgot my own age
236000	243000	But anyway the point is is if you're watching the visual whether it be live or via your twitch subscription for vog network
243000	247000	You can actually see see usually it would be myself and it would be loki on camera
247000	252000	DarkSakura sometimes on camera when she feels like it because you know it's her choice if she wants to get on camera or not
252000	257000	But without loki here I'm a little lonely so some of the various plushies that I have
257000	263000	That actually Alan freaking won some of these on that crane site
263000	267000	Torreba I think is the name of it I don't know what it is it's one of those freaking crane game sites
267000	271000	I shouldn't even give it a plug because he wasted so much time on that site and they're not paying me any money
271000	277000	But he did win this little hamster thing in that master ball looking thing but captain pikachu and I go way back
277000	283000	I've had this life-sized pikachu for a long time so I have to have something to fill in for loki when he's not here
283000	287000	Maybe next week I'll get some round table breadsticks those will remind me of loki
287000	290000	Maybe we'll see
290000	298000	It might be a few weeks that we're on this system of doing OLR
298000	302000	I think it's important that we continue to do OLR to the best of our ability
302000	307000	But the reality is we're not exactly going to defy the governor's order
307000	313000	So once that is lifted and changed then we'll consider getting back together again
313000	320000	Which if what we just heard earlier today in the national news is any guideline it's going to be at least till the end of April
320000	326000	But you know gotta keep people healthy gotta make sure we squash this thing flatten the curve
326000	330000	Try not to spread it around to people that don't need to have it myself included
330000	334000	So yeah we're just doing what we have to do
334000	340000	That didn't stop my neighbors from having their motorcycle party earlier today
340000	345000	What is up with that? We've been having neighbors that have been having parties too and I'm like you guys are missing the point
345000	349000	You're just gonna you're ruining it for everybody. It's horrible
349000	357000	Maybe they watched Tiger King and decided to bring their well I wouldn't even say it's their inner redneck because it's kind of their whole persona
357000	359000	But you know amp that up a bit
359000	361000	Have you been getting obsessed with Tiger King?
361000	364000	That is all everybody is fucking talking about on Twitch
364000	366000	It's Animal Crossing and Tiger King
366000	368000	I'm surprised the two haven't come together yet
368000	370000	I have watched the whole thing though
370000	371000	Of course you have
371000	373000	It seems like the type of thing your wife would be into
373000	374000	And she was, yes
374000	376000	Of course she was
376000	380000	No I've held off on Tiger King thus far
380000	383000	I am finally trying to finish Love is Blind
383000	387000	So I'm a few like and that was the big thing everybody was watching in February on Netflix
387000	389000	So I'm a little bit behind
389000	393000	So what is that? Is that because I sort of remember a show that was on the soup or something
393000	397000	Where they have like people in like a dark room talking to each other and they weren't able to see each other
397000	398000	Is that that show?
398000	400000	Yeah but the soup has been off TV for years
400000	402000	Love is Blind is a newer show
402000	406000	But they can only, they're in these like pod things and they can only talk to each other and they can't see each other
406000	410000	And then, but it's weird because like the first three episodes are that
410000	413000	And then the rest of it is, haha now let's see if it works
413000	415000	Or if they become a hot mess and surprise
415000	418000	Some of them are total hot messes when they get together in person
418000	423000	I mean I'm sure we're all shocked at the type of people that go on those sort of dating reality shows
423000	428000	That you put some, you mix them up in a room and there's drama, surprise right?
428000	429000	Yeah
430000	432000	Alright anyway, let's get into actual video game chat
432000	434000	I mean we could sit here and talk Netflix
434000	439000	I mean I guess we could talk about like Castlevania, Ingress anime
439000	442000	Or there's that other Netflix thing I bet is on y'all's mind
442000	444000	Yes it's in the news, we'll get to that a little later
444000	446000	But first while we get to tonight's kickoff topic
446000	448000	Loki, what are we starting off with tonight?
449000	453000	So they have the Nintendo Direct, or surprise Nintendo Direct I guess
453000	461000	That was earlier this week talking about some indie games and some other like additions to current Nintendo games
461000	467000	So for example they talked about their progress in Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition
467000	472000	They announced that some 2K games are going to be coming to the Switch
472000	476000	Including the Biostock Collection and Borderlands
476000	478000	Those are going to be coming
478000	480000	I think that's, oh wait just real quick
480000	483000	I think that's great about Borderlands and Bioshock
483000	488000	But I don't know, this seems to be like the Switch's MO or something
488000	490000	How old are these games at this point?
490000	493000	And it's just now getting to Nintendo's console
493000	497000	It's not a read, it's not a dis, I understand
497000	502000	There's some people out there that are going to be very excited with the portability of a game like Bioshock
502000	508000	But I don't know, I feel like those are games that are better experienced on a big TV
508000	511000	Which yes I know the Switch can do, but you know the high end graphics and all that stuff
511000	518000	I don't know, I feel like those are little scraps that the Nintendo fans are getting tossed
518000	523000	Don't get me wrong, I love my Switch, I'm super jazzed about other stuff that was in there
523000	526000	Maybe it's just one of those not for me dot com type of things
526000	530000	It's probably just pretty easy to port that stuff over I guess
530000	533000	I guess, maybe, just maybe the engine they're built in or whatever
533000	537000	It doesn't take a lot of man hours to port that over to Switch
537000	540000	I don't know, I just always feel like those are kind of scraps
540000	544000	And then they have the XCOM 2 collection as well
544000	548000	So that was something that was announced there
548000	553000	Burnout Paradise Remastered was another game that's supposed to be coming to the Switch as well
553000	556000	And then some of the other things they talked about
556000	563000	There's the final piece of DLC for Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3, so it's a fantastic 4
564000	569000	They talked a little bit about Animal Crossing New Horizons
569000	572000	That's going to have their seasonal event Bunny Day
572000	575000	Which that bunny is super creepy
576000	578000	But that's going to be taking place
578000	581000	Too bad it wasn't the bunny from Silent Hill
581000	583000	It pretty much is
583000	585000	Can you do the reskins maybe?
585000	591000	Can you design the bunny an outfit and make the bunny wear Silent Hill costumes?
591000	596000	I don't know, but Zipper is looking pretty creepy
596000	601000	I mean, think about how fucking crazy business Animal Crossing is doing right now
601000	604000	Animal Crossing is probably bigger than it's ever been
604000	608000	And it's because in large part of what's going on in the world
608000	611000	We don't have our real lives to talk about
611000	613000	So what are we talking about on social media?
613000	615000	Our fake ones in Animal Crossing
615000	619000	I think this game would have done fine as it is in a normal world
619000	621000	But now especially that we're all shut in
621000	624000	And we can't go out and fish for real
624000	626000	Or go out and do things out in nature for real
626000	628000	We're all sharing it through Animal Crossing
628000	630000	I don't know about y'all's social media
630000	633000	But my social media is filled with Animal Crossing stuff
633000	634000	And I just feel like
634000	638000	And the reason why I say all that is that this game and this franchise has never been hotter
638000	641000	In my opinion, with what's going on in pop culture and stuff
641000	647000	This just seems like the time for Nintendo to really let us tweak it even more
647000	650000	Let us design some of our villagers
650000	654000	I would love to have villagers that imitate Pyramid Head and stuff
654000	658000	But maybe that is exactly what Nintendo does not want to open the flood gate to
658000	663000	If you could draw your own patterns for the villagers
663000	665000	I guess you could always give them shirts and things
665000	668000	But I feel like if you could totally reskin the villagers
668000	670000	Somebody's gonna do Nudzu
670000	672000	Somebody's gonna do Nudyzu
672000	674000	And it's gonna get awkward
674000	675000	I saw someone
675000	676000	Then you're gonna have Tiger King
676000	678000	Then you're gonna fucking have Tiger King
678000	682000	Well I saw somebody though actually on Twitter
682000	684000	And I want to say it might have been Mayor Marvel
684000	686000	But I thought it was
686000	689000	They did a dress that had a butt on the back of it
689000	691000	Oh yes, oh my god I saw that
691000	693000	Somebody had a dress pattern
693000	694000	But they drew a butt on it
694000	698000	So it just looked like the person's butt was hanging out of the back of the dress
698000	700000	That was great, I love it
700000	703000	Yes, it already happened
703000	705000	Oh you creative people
705000	710000	Oh and through the QR code and generate your own pattern sites
710000	713000	Anyway, people are putting all sorts of filthy things
713000	715000	But funny things too
715000	720000	Like I found online a shocked Pikachu painting that I have now
720000	722000	I have an N7 logo up
722000	724000	What else do I have?
724000	726000	I have
726000	730000	Oh a friend of mine sent me Rocky Horror Picture Show related ones
730000	734000	So now I have a throne scene with Frank N. Furter and friends all up there
735000	736000	Okay
736000	739000	Yeah so it's just all this crazy stuff you can get with QR codes
739000	743000	So aside from the Bunny D event which of course they're gonna be hiding eggs
743000	745000	And they have special crafting things
745000	748000	There are some other games that they are talking about
748000	750000	One called Good Job
750000	752000	It looked pretty cool
752000	755000	And then some new
755000	759000	They're gonna have a demo for Bravely Default 2
759000	763000	As well as they're saying that Star Wars Jedi Knight Jedi Academy
763000	766000	And the Panzer Dragoon remake
766000	768000	Those are all announced as well
768000	771000	And then the Bravely
771000	778000	No I was gonna say the Bravely Default 2 demo came out with the day of the Nintendo Direct
778000	781000	So I didn't get around to playing it but some friends of mine played it
781000	784000	I'm hearing kind of mixed reviews on it
784000	786000	Some people are really into it
786000	788000	You know those that probably really enjoyed the first Bravely Default
788000	791000	I'm hearing a lot of criticism about some of the character design
791000	792000	And some of the voice acting
792000	794000	I guess there's one character in particular
794000	796000	That's like please stop
796000	798000	Please stop this now
798000	801000	So don't know we'll see how it goes
801000	805000	Okay so and then we also had Clubhouse Games
805000	807000	51 Worldwide Classics
807000	809000	That's been announced
809000	811000	That's coming on the Switch on June 5th
811000	815000	I wanna just say I wanted that freaking franchise to make a comeback
815000	817000	Yeah
817000	819000	Well I was so
819000	821000	And then oddly enough
821000	824000	Games that no one ever asked to be ported to the Switch
824000	827000	Star Wars Episode 1 Racer
827000	829000	It's coming to the Switch
829000	831000	Why?
831000	833000	Because the pod racing was the only thing cool about that
833000	835000	I don't know maybe it's another one of those like
835000	839000	It was fairly simple to port so we did it
839000	843000	I guess porting games is the new shovelware
845000	847000	Perhaps
847000	849000	Anyways and then of course
849000	852000	New Fighter announced for the Smash Ultimate DLC
852000	854000	And that new fighter is Arms
854000	857000	Now I don't know if that's all of the different characters in Arms or just
857000	859000	One of the characters
859000	860000	You're kind of half right
860000	862000	They just announced that the next character
862000	864000	Would be from Arms
864000	866000	But they didn't say who it would be
866000	869000	And I know a lot of people are hoping for Twintelle
869000	872000	Just because she was a kind of standout character from Arms
872000	874000	But the thing about Twintelle
874000	876000	And the reason why I don't think it's going to be her
876000	878000	Is that Twintelle actually uses her hair
878000	880000	Not her arms
880000	882000	Like she's the one with the big braids
882000	885000	So I don't know if she'll end up being the character or not
885000	887000	I don't really play Arms
887000	889000	I've tried to play it a little bit
889000	891000	And I'm going to be honest
891000	893000	I didn't care for it
893000	896000	So I kind of wonder why Nintendo is trying to make Arms happen now
896000	898000	Because they did that
898000	900000	They're doing the free play weekend or whatever
900000	902000	Okay
902000	904000	But I guess other people were into it
904000	906000	Sure, but I wasn't a big Arms fan
906000	908000	So I'm kind of meh on this news
908000	910000	Yeah, I remember they were trying to position
910000	912000	As like an eSports title
912000	914000	Almost
914000	916000	That was kind of the trend there
916000	918000	Where everyone wanted to be an eSports title
918000	920000	And it just wasn't going to happen
920000	922000	Yeah
922000	924000	No, it didn't happen
924000	926000	Maybe eSports has
926000	928000	Got a new focus on it now
928000	930000	Because of this whole stay at home stuff
930000	932000	And how it's affecting
932000	934000	Some of the programming on television and stuff
934000	936000	But that seems a little too
936000	938000	Like I don't think Nintendo
938000	940000	Is putting Arms in Smash
940000	942000	Because suddenly due to Coronavirus
942000	944000	They sense a rise in eSports
944000	946000	That is too calculated
946000	948000	And would have taken more time to plan
948000	950000	Than the reality of this situation
950000	952000	No, I don't think that's at all
952000	954000	I'm just saying
954000	956000	I don't think eSports even around Arms is ever going to happen
956000	958000	But
958000	960000	I was going to say the last bit of news
960000	962000	In addition to
962000	964000	Ring Fit Adventure
964000	966000	They're getting an update which adds a new rhythm game mode
966000	968000	They have songs from Super Mario Odyssey
968000	970000	Splatoon 2 and Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild
970000	972000	Which is pretty cool
972000	974000	Man, if only we could get some pop songs in there too
974000	976000	Like that would be great
976000	978000	I have not played that mode yet
978000	980000	I've seen some tweets from people who've been playing it
980000	982000	And I've watched some of the YouTubes and stuff
982000	984000	So it kind of looks like
984000	986000	Just instead of the notes falling
986000	988000	From the top down
988000	990000	They kind of come in more of a
990000	992000	Well shaped thing
992000	994000	Like Guitar Hero
994000	996000	Because I guess we learned all those years ago
996000	998000	That Konami actually has the patent
998000	1000000	On the notes falling from the top
1000000	1002000	Of the screen down
1002000	1004000	So that's why all the music games now do it
1004000	1006000	Where it's coming at you
1006000	1008000	Because Konami doesn't have the patent on that
1008000	1010000	That patent has run out already
1010000	1012000	I don't know
1012000	1014000	But for whatever reason
1014000	1016000	Nintendo is doing it where it's coming out at you
1016000	1018000	And you can see the motions with the controller
1018000	1020000	With the ring controller
1020000	1022000	Like it might squeeze on a certain bit
1022000	1024000	Or you might kind of tilt it left or right
1024000	1026000	At a certain point
1026000	1028000	And that is all dictated by when the notes
1028000	1030000	Get to the front
1030000	1032000	It looked interesting
1032000	1034000	I want to try it
1034000	1036000	It probably shows
1036000	1038000	I haven't really played Ring Fit
1038000	1040000	Since quarantine started
1040000	1042000	But I have been snacking
1042000	1044000	I probably should be playing Ring Fit
1044000	1046000	Some folks in chat talking about
1046000	1048000	Arms
1048000	1050000	AJ Twist is asking
1050000	1052000	Isn't there an Arms character that is a trophy in Smash already
1052000	1054000	I do believe you are correct
1054000	1056000	And they're talking about Spring Man
1056000	1058000	Act F says I totally forgot the name is the armed guy
1058000	1060000	AJ Twist says Spring Man
1060000	1062000	Yeah I think they're kind of like
1062000	1064000	Mascot guy that's like on the box
1064000	1066000	I believe he is some type of assist
1066000	1068000	Trophy already in Smash
1068000	1070000	Not that
1070000	1072000	Assist trophies and the like
1072000	1074000	It has stopped characters from becoming
1074000	1076000	Full blown characters before
1076000	1078000	I feel like
1078000	1080000	There was something that got upgraded
1080000	1082000	Along the way but
1082000	1084000	It escapes me in the moment
1084000	1086000	Man what are we getting Geno? Seriously
1086000	1088000	Well you've got four
1088000	1090000	Four more
1090000	1092000	Characters after this one
1092000	1094000	So you never know what might happen
1094000	1096000	Bobby Black Wolf says it has stopped Waluigi
1096000	1098000	Hey never say never
1098000	1100000	Until that tenth character is announced
1100000	1102000	Not that I want to give false hope but
1102000	1104000	I don't know I feel like they
1104000	1106000	Weren't originally planning to do a
1106000	1108000	Second set of DLC I feel like
1108000	1110000	And now they're doing it so they've had enough time
1110000	1112000	To hear the fan feedback and they might do it
1112000	1114000	Who knows but I think
1114000	1116000	If Waluigi does happen it will be the very
1116000	1118000	Very last one
1118000	1120000	Act F says Little Mac was an assist trophy
1120000	1122000	In Brawl before he became a full character in
1122000	1124000	Smash 4 yes I knew there was like one
1124000	1126000	That like got upgraded but I guess that
1126000	1128000	Wouldn't have really been within the same game
1128000	1130000	So was that everything
1130000	1132000	From the Nintendo Direct Loki?
1132000	1134000	Yeah pretty much So what did you think overall
1134000	1136000	Of the Direct and what you
1136000	1138000	I mean if you didn't watch it the highlights I guess
1138000	1140000	I didn't really watch it
1140000	1142000	I mean
1142000	1144000	I don't know
1144000	1146000	It's alright there wasn't really anything
1146000	1148000	That was super exciting about
1148000	1150000	Unfortunately I'm not a huge fan of Clubhouse games
1150000	1152000	I'm sure it's a great game
1152000	1154000	Don't really care that
1154000	1156000	Bioshock Infinite and all that says to be important to
1156000	1158000	The other system I have it on green systems already
1158000	1160000	So it's like eh I don't really
1160000	1162000	Need it
1162000	1164000	I don't know
1164000	1166000	There's nothing super exciting coming out of that
1166000	1168000	Unfortunately
1168000	1170000	Well it was a mini so you know it wasn't
1170000	1172000	Like I guess I don't know what the difference is
1172000	1174000	It was still 30 minutes they could have just called
1174000	1176000	It a regular Direct and it probably would have been fine
1176000	1178000	For me the Xenoblade stuff
1178000	1180000	That remake looks hot
1180000	1182000	I'm definitely going to buy that when it comes out
1182000	1184000	They definitely kind of took a deep dive into that
1184000	1186000	A little bit because I don't know if we'll get
1186000	1188000	Maybe there will be a special Direct
1188000	1190000	I guess before June there ought to be another Direct
1190000	1192000	Of sorts so they'll probably show even more on that game
1192000	1194000	But I'm definitely going to pick that up when it comes out
1194000	1196000	And otherwise
1196000	1198000	Yeah like the 2K games are a little bit like
1198000	1200000	Okay I already kind of have like all of the
1200000	1202000	Things I want on Playstation already
1202000	1204000	But I guess cool for the Nintendo exclusive folks
1204000	1206000	Or some folks are saying in chat
1206000	1208000	If you really want to play it in a portable setting
1208000	1210000	Which isn't for me
1210000	1212000	But maybe it's for you so cool
1212000	1214000	And then some of the
1214000	1216000	Clubhouse games obviously I'm a very big fan of
1216000	1218000	So those were some nice little surprises
1218000	1220000	It wasn't like an oh my god
1220000	1222000	Type of thing but it was some nice surprises
1222000	1224000	Nice little treats
1224000	1226000	Especially when there's a lot of shit news in the world right now
1226000	1228000	It was kind of nice to have something a little bit like
1228000	1230000	Oh I have this to look forward to that's a nice thing
1232000	1234000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says
1234000	1236000	I hope they just did a mini
1236000	1238000	Just to shut up all the Twitter trolls
1238000	1240000	That beg for a Nintendo Direct every time
1241000	1243000	Well I don't think they did it just for that reason
1243000	1245000	But clearly Nintendo had a few things
1245000	1247000	That they just wanted to like drop on people
1247000	1250000	Because what they put out that Bravely Default 2 demo
1250000	1252000	They put out Panzer Dragoon
1252000	1254000	Came out day and date
1254000	1256000	They started taking your money
1256000	1258000	For clubhouse games
1258000	1260000	So they kind of had a backlog
1260000	1262000	Maybe a small backlog of things
1262000	1264000	They just kind of wanted to get out there
1264000	1266000	And make sure people knew about
1266000	1268000	So I think it kind of served its purpose in that regard
1268000	1270000	So
1270000	1272000	AgDef says if it was a big Direct
1272000	1274000	There would be like a big announcement
1274000	1276000	And they probably would have given you more time too
1276000	1278000	They probably would have said we'll do one tomorrow
1278000	1280000	Instead of
1280000	1282000	Did they say later did they drop one the same day
1282000	1284000	Or did they give you a days notice
1284000	1286000	I don't remember
1286000	1288000	Yeah
1288000	1290000	So those are some of the comments from our chat room
1290000	1292000	Oh interesting AJ Twist says
1292000	1294000	Maybe it was called a mini Direct
1294000	1296000	Because there was no human host
1296000	1298000	That's an interesting thought as well
1298000	1300000	Is that they didn't
1300000	1302000	Yeah they didn't have anybody
1302000	1304000	From Nintendo either Japan
1304000	1306000	Or America or anyone really
1306000	1308000	Talking us through the different announcements
1308000	1310000	So that is a very very good point
1310000	1312000	Maybe that's one of the differences between
1312000	1314000	A mini and a regular Direct
1314000	1316000	And perhaps in this era of social distancing
1316000	1318000	Where many Nintendo people
1318000	1320000	Are working from home
1320000	1322000	Maybe they weren't able to get all the footage they needed in time
1322000	1324000	Although you know many of these Directs
1324000	1326000	They filmed that stuff way in advance
1326000	1328000	So you know
1328000	1330000	The world has changed very fast
1330000	1332000	In the scope of two to three weeks
1332000	1334000	And I would bet they already knew what was going in this Direct
1334000	1336000	Like a month ago
1336000	1338000	For the most part they knew this Direct at least a month ago
1338000	1340000	If not even further back
1340000	1342000	I would bet
1342000	1344000	E3's Direct or I'm using my quotey fingers
1344000	1346000	E3's Direct
1346000	1348000	The inevitable June Direct
1348000	1350000	That Nintendo I guess can drop at any point they want to now
1350000	1352000	That Direct
1352000	1354000	They probably already at least have their outline
1354000	1356000	Of what's gonna be in that
1356000	1358000	And they're probably starting to script that out
1358000	1360000	And then they'll shoot that bit by bit
1360000	1362000	That will have live talking faces with that
1362000	1364000	So
1364000	1366000	Anyway, alright so Nintendo Direct
1366000	1368000	A nice pleasant surprise from Nintendo this week
1368000	1370000	So let's talk a little bit about the types of games
1370000	1372000	That we have been playing this week
1372000	1374000	Since Dark Soccer is not here tonight
1374000	1376000	We'll start with you Loki, how was your gaming week?
1376000	1378000	I didn't play much of anything
1378000	1380000	Aside from
1380000	1382000	Just
1382000	1384000	Forna
1384000	1386000	Because I've been trying to fix my computer
1386000	1388000	So
1388000	1390000	Didn't get around too much
1390000	1392000	I have started working on
1392000	1394000	Putting StepMania in the DDR cabinet
1394000	1396000	Because we have been using it a bit more
1396000	1398000	I just haven't really been playing too much
1398000	1400000	But like literally right now
1400000	1402000	I have the PC for that cabinet
1402000	1404000	On my desk here
1404000	1406000	I've been copying songs over
1406000	1408000	Probably should
1408000	1410000	I need to get everything loaded in
1410000	1412000	So that I can test it
1412000	1414000	But it's almost
1414000	1416000	Probably pretty close to being ready to go
1416000	1418000	I just need to mount the PC onto
1418000	1420000	Like a board or something
1420000	1422000	So I can set it in there
1422000	1424000	Figure out how to wire it up
1424000	1426000	So I can switch between the PC
1426000	1428000	And the
1428000	1430000	Actual System 573 board
1430000	1432000	That's in there
1432000	1434000	Yeah I was gonna say I saw on Twitter
1434000	1436000	Or Facebook or something I saw a video
1436000	1438000	Of a Dance Dance Revolution machine you have in your garage
1438000	1440000	So did that kind of awaken
1440000	1442000	The I want to do something else with this
1442000	1444000	Machine sort of part within you
1444000	1446000	Well I just had
1446000	1448000	A lot of time where I wasn't able to
1448000	1450000	Work on stuff or we
1450000	1452000	Didn't have to go anywhere so I had a lot of time to
1452000	1454000	Kind of
1454000	1456000	Put all that together and earlier
1456000	1458000	We got redownloading packs and everything
1458000	1460000	And then I finally found all the
1460000	1462000	Download packs that I had and I was like
1462000	1464000	Oh man
1464000	1466000	I just have to
1466000	1468000	What I'm doing now is I'm kind of setting it up to test it
1468000	1470000	I was originally wanting to make my own
1470000	1472000	Theme and everything for it
1472000	1474000	But I think I'm gonna put that on the back burner for now
1474000	1476000	Until I just want to get it
1476000	1478000	Running and get it going and then
1478000	1480000	I'll do themes and all that stuff
1480000	1482000	Later but I have to sort out
1482000	1484000	How I want to sort all of the songs
1484000	1486000	That are in there
1486000	1488000	I think I want to kind of do it more like extreme
1488000	1490000	Where has it kind of by
1490000	1492000	Mix that's come out and then
1492000	1494000	Of course
1494000	1496000	I think A.C.E. might be the
1496000	1498000	Dance System Revolution A
1498000	1500000	I think they have it
1500000	1502000	Organized somewhat similar
1502000	1504000	I want to do it like that
1504000	1506000	Probably the theme I'm going with
1506000	1508000	Is it's a fan made theme
1508000	1510000	Called Supernova 3
1510000	1512000	It kind of looks like the old
1512000	1514000	Supernova or even like
1514000	1516000	Extreme setups with the song wheel
1516000	1518000	And everything
1518000	1520000	It seems to be pretty lightweight
1520000	1522000	I'll probably do that
1522000	1524000	Cause I mean it should be pretty fast
1524000	1526000	I think I had originally tested it with the
1526000	1528000	A.C.E. theme on there
1528000	1530000	But we'll see
1530000	1532000	When I end up doing mine it'll be much fancier
1532000	1534000	And probably a little bit more unique
1534000	1536000	Ok alright adventures in Loki's
1536000	1538000	DDR machine
1538000	1540000	So for my gaming week so I've been playing
1540000	1542000	A lot cause you know video games help pass
1542000	1544000	The time sadly for discussion
1544000	1546000	Purposes I've been playing a lot of the same things
1546000	1548000	I usually play like continuing to play Final Fantasy
1548000	1550000	14 games like that
1550000	1552000	And MMO's are a great like social
1552000	1554000	Thing right now and you can't really like go outside and be
1554000	1556000	Social so I think that's why I tend to
1556000	1558000	Sink a lot of hours into something like Final Fantasy 14
1558000	1560000	Been trying to play the
1560000	1562000	GPS games on those rare occasions
1562000	1564000	I go out and walk like obviously
1564000	1566000	You know I can't really go out and do anything too crazy
1566000	1568000	But like last night we
1568000	1570000	Drove to a restaurant to get pickup food
1570000	1572000	And I was like Alan can you drive
1572000	1574000	So I can play Orna while you drive
1574000	1576000	So he agreed to do that
1576000	1578000	So that was kind of nice so I was able to get some GPS gaming
1578000	1580000	In there and I do a little bit on my walks
1580000	1582000	As well but haven't been doing anything too
1582000	1584000	Crazy with that for obvious reasons
1584000	1586000	Still continuing on Diablo 3 as well
1586000	1588000	I did make sure to play
1588000	1590000	A new game this week because
1590000	1592000	Since I do have
1592000	1594000	All this time and I have
1594000	1596000	Xbox Game Pass along with
1596000	1598000	Many other ways to play a variety of
1598000	1600000	Different games such as like the free games they give
1600000	1602000	On the Epic Store you know
1602000	1604000	And giveaways here and there and everywhere
1604000	1606000	There's no shortage of games in the backlog
1606000	1608000	To play so one of the games I decided to
1608000	1610000	Check out this week which is on
1610000	1612000	Xbox Game Pass although apparently it's
1612000	1614000	Going away soon because it does say it's
1614000	1616000	Like a limited amount of time left so
1616000	1618000	I don't know if I just started this game in time for it to
1618000	1620000	Leave at the beginning of the month I don't know
1620000	1622000	But it's a game called Kingsway
1622000	1624000	So what this game is
1624000	1626000	It's like an RPG
1626000	1628000	But the RPG it's like a
1628000	1630000	Classic you know swords and sorcery
1630000	1632000	Type of RPG like a Final Fantasy
1632000	1634000	English thing but it's
1634000	1636000	Framed around
1636000	1638000	An operating system
1638000	1640000	And it looks like an
1640000	1642000	Old operating system like a
1642000	1644000	Windows 3.1 operating system
1644000	1646000	From like 1994
1646000	1648000	Or something where you
1648000	1650000	Like double click on the world map
1650000	1652000	Window to bring up the map
1652000	1654000	And as you click where to go
1654000	1656000	You see your little character move and a little progress bar
1656000	1658000	And you can hear like it really emulates
1658000	1660000	Like a little disk drive going
1660000	1662000	Making the little noises the disk drives would do
1662000	1664000	And then like different windows will pop up
1664000	1666000	Like if you run into a monster a window will pop up
1666000	1668000	And you have to like fight it and so you
1668000	1670000	Do your inventory management through
1670000	1672000	Windows so it's really
1672000	1674000	Clever how they
1674000	1676000	Kind of built this concept of
1676000	1678000	We're going to do an RPG but it's going to be based
1678000	1680000	Within an operating system so it's
1680000	1682000	Like Windows the RPG but it's
1682000	1684000	Kind of clever and I
1684000	1686000	Think people who probably grew up
1686000	1688000	Around that era like I think of
1688000	1690000	Somebody like Bobby Blackwolf and I know
1690000	1692000	He's a big fan of these types of old
1692000	1694000	MS-DOS games back in the day
1694000	1696000	I think he would really get a kick out of this game
1696000	1698000	But I'm not sure a lot of
1698000	1700000	Folks like let's say
1700000	1702000	By the time you were born
1702000	1704000	Uh you know modern
1704000	1706000	PCs and Windows XP and all that
1706000	1708000	Stuff was already kind of the norm by the time you
1708000	1710000	Were a child I don't know if there's
1710000	1712000	Going to be as much here for you because it's not
1712000	1714000	Going to be the same type of nostalgia trip
1714000	1716000	But I think the nostalgia trip for
1716000	1718000	Gamers of a certain age is kind of
1718000	1720000	Fun so it's one of those games that's worth
1720000	1722000	Checking out especially if you have Xbox
1722000	1724000	Game Pass anyway
1724000	1726000	I don't think it's on Xbox
1726000	1728000	It wouldn't make sense why it would be on Xbox
1728000	1730000	The console because obviously it's very mouse
1730000	1732000	Driven so it's the type of thing that strikes me as
1732000	1734000	Very like a PC thing so if you have it
1734000	1736000	You might as well check it out if
1736000	1738000	You can it might be leaving
1738000	1740000	Game Pass very very soon
1740000	1742000	I believe so
1742000	1744000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says
1744000	1746000	If it's in the leaving soon
1746000	1748000	Area of Game Pass then it goes away on the
1748000	1750000	31st well I guess I'm glad I played
1750000	1752000	It when I could I've been eyeing
1752000	1754000	It says Bobby I remember seeing
1754000	1756000	It all the PR for it from adult
1756000	1758000	Swim games yeah it's published by them
1758000	1760000	As shown under Matt says
1760000	1762000	Yeah I could play at home too I just need to get out
1762000	1764000	Move around being inside is
1764000	1766000	Maddening I know oh that's a response to something
1766000	1768000	It was Act F was saying in chat
1768000	1770000	Yeah it's
1770000	1772000	You got to find that right balance of
1772000	1774000	Going outside I haven't been going outside enough
1774000	1776000	Quite frankly but I kind of get sick
1776000	1778000	Of the same old walk like since
1778000	1780000	I live like right and without giving away my
1780000	1782000	Address here on the program
1782000	1784000	Since I live right in the heart of
1784000	1786000	Suburbia it's like within walking
1786000	1788000	Distance is a park
1788000	1790000	And if I want to walk a really
1790000	1792000	Long distance I could get to a couple other parks
1792000	1794000	But that's a
1794000	1796000	Long and it's like it's like a commitment
1796000	1798000	It's like if I walk all the way to one of the other parks
1798000	1800000	Then I got to walk back so
1800000	1802000	I mean I guess I could get in the car and drive
1802000	1804000	Somewhere but then you get into all these problems
1804000	1806000	Of well if you drive to the
1806000	1808000	Park that everyone wants to go to
1808000	1810000	Then it's too crowded and it defeats
1810000	1812000	The purpose that was a problem they were having
1812000	1814000	With the beaches and stuff right
1814000	1816000	So you got to find that right balance it's tricky
1816000	1818000	But luckily thanks to things like
1818000	1820000	Pokemon Go and Ingress
1820000	1822000	And the other GPS things I've played over the years
1822000	1824000	I have a pretty good sense of
1824000	1826000	Where all the big parks are in town
1826000	1828000	That don't get too crowded
1828000	1830000	So I guess that part is kind of nice
1830000	1832000	So that's good
1832000	1834000	And there's always like the river
1834000	1836000	I have been tempted to go down
1836000	1838000	To Capitol Park do you think they'd throw people
1838000	1840000	Out of Capitol Park I don't think they would
1840000	1842000	It's still very wide open you can keep your space
1842000	1844000	From people there as long as it's not swarming with people
1844000	1846000	But I don't know like I don't want to be
1846000	1848000	That person you know
1848000	1850000	That's setting a bad example so
1850000	1852000	Or just putting myself at risk quite frankly
1854000	1856000	But yeah I miss those really
1856000	1858000	Dense Pokemon places like Capitol Park
1858000	1860000	Would be fun so
1860000	1862000	Anyway well that's enough for my gaming week
1862000	1864000	So a lot of the same old stuff but I'm trying
1864000	1866000	To squeeze in at least one new game a week
1866000	1868000	While I'm here at home catching up
1868000	1870000	On the backlog a little bit I already know what game
1870000	1872000	I want to play for next week except
1872000	1874000	I forgot the name of it but it was another game
1874000	1876000	On Xbox Game Pass that totally looked like
1876000	1878000	It looks like it's Devil's Crush or Alien's Crush
1878000	1880000	Or something like that like it's another pinball game
1880000	1882000	And I think it's even called like Demon something
1882000	1884000	Somebody in chat will yell it out I'm sure
1884000	1886000	But that is the game I wanted to get around to it this week
1886000	1888000	But I didn't get to it so that's the game I definitely
1888000	1890000	Want to check out for next week so
1890000	1892000	That game looks really cool so
1892000	1894000	Alright
1894000	1896000	See a Tiberian chat talking about
1896000	1898000	The beaches stuff
1898000	1900000	It's interesting how the social game
1900000	1902000	Swarm what Foursquare originally
1902000	1904000	Was is now not
1904000	1906000	Awarding as many points if you're going outside
1906000	1908000	Of a home area and when you choose
1908000	1910000	To do something that's not like a housing
1910000	1912000	Development it pops up and says
1912000	1914000	Stay home that's kind of an interesting use
1914000	1916000	Of some of those GPS things
1916000	1918000	It is interesting seeing how a lot of those things have had to
1918000	1920000	Adapt things like Pokemon Go
1920000	1922000	Have kind of had to change how the game works
1922000	1924000	A little bit
1924000	1926000	To get beyond Minecraft Earth
1926000	1928000	Did something similar I heard this week
1928000	1930000	Have you checked that out?
1930000	1932000	I heard Minecraft Earth did something
1932000	1934000	Yeah so they did this thing
1934000	1936000	I checked it out for a second and I saw
1936000	1938000	It's turning very much into
1938000	1940000	A regular mobile game
1940000	1942000	So what they added is
1942000	1944000	These runes that basically
1944000	1946000	If you play Minecraft Earth
1946000	1948000	So part of the game is just collecting
1948000	1950000	The tappables that are on the screen to get
1950000	1952000	All the blocks which really if you
1952000	1954000	Just drive around you're going to have a ton
1954000	1956000	Of stuff
1956000	1958000	So they have it like
1958000	1960000	Parks there's these things called adventures
1960000	1962000	Where you can get additional blocks
1962000	1964000	And you also get experience
1964000	1966000	And other things
1966000	1968000	Then they have this AR interactive
1968000	1970000	Thing that you do so
1970000	1972000	What these runes do is they
1972000	1974000	Cause you to spawn and adventure
1974000	1976000	Like
1976000	1978000	Wherever you're at
1978000	1980000	So they give you one for free
1980000	1982000	To be able to spawn one of those
1982000	1984000	Adventures
1984000	1986000	It's only the taste that's free
1986000	1988000	And then after that you got paid for it
1988000	1990000	Use your rubies
1990000	1992000	Or whatever they're in the game
1992000	1994000	But you earn those pretty quick
1994000	1996000	I didn't see where I could actually spend those
1996000	1998000	To do that
1998000	2000000	And ever since I haven't played the game
2000000	2002000	In a long time so now it's just like
2002000	2004000	Full of like different
2004000	2006000	XP boosts and different
2006000	2008000	Food boosts and HP boosts
2008000	2010000	And I'm like oh my god
2010000	2012000	This is way too
2012000	2014000	Just like demanding of
2014000	2016000	Your money it's just like come on
2016000	2018000	Pay pay pay pay
2018000	2020000	That kind of really turns me off from playing that game
2020000	2022000	S2100 Matt says
2022000	2024000	Demons Tilt was the name of the game I was trying to think of
2024000	2026000	Yes that is it you got it
2026000	2028000	Interesting S2100 Matt says
2028000	2030000	Waze yells at you when you open it up asking if you really
2030000	2032000	Need to be outside right now really
2032000	2034000	Because I've been a good boy
2034000	2036000	And following all the rules I haven't seen all the apps
2036000	2038000	Doing these things so that's very
2038000	2040000	That's really interesting
2040000	2042000	Interesting how these apps have had to adapt
2042000	2044000	Let's just hope it doesn't go on
2044000	2046000	Forever and you know
2046000	2048000	If we happen to have some folks
2048000	2050000	That are working
2050000	2052000	In the healthcare industry and really on the
2052000	2054000	Front lines of what's going on right now
2054000	2056000	Thank you for what you guys are doing
2056000	2058000	I know it really can't be fun right now
2058000	2060000	So thank you so much
2060000	2062000	Hell grocery store employees
2062000	2064000	And Costco employees that really
2064000	2066000	Can't be fun either right now so
2066000	2068000	A big thanks to everybody that's
2068000	2070000	Really stepping up in this time
2070000	2072000	Of I can't believe
2072000	2074000	It's actually happening this
2074000	2076000	Alright anyhow let's move on
2076000	2078000	Back to video games and traveling
2078000	2080000	Around the globe
2080000	2082000	Checking out the latest and greatest in gaming news
2082000	2084000	Because while folks are still working
2084000	2086000	From home and while the world is getting used to
2086000	2088000	What's going on right now there is still
2088000	2090000	More gaming news
2090000	2092000	Such as Loki starting us off
2092000	2094000	Kind of a follow up
2094000	2096000	To something from last week kind of sort of right
2096000	2098000	Yeah so we talked a little bit last week
2098000	2100000	About how GameStop is considering them
2100000	2102000	An essential
2102000	2104000	Retailer and
2104000	2106000	That they need to stay open during this whole
2106000	2108000	Corona outbreak thing
2108000	2110000	However they're not the only
2110000	2112000	Game company to have done that
2112000	2114000	So there's another retailer by the name of
2114000	2116000	Game Exchange
2116000	2118000	Let's make sure we're hating on everybody appropriately
2118000	2120000	Let's make sure we've
2120000	2122000	Saved enough of our internet rage for other
2122000	2124000	Asshole companies
2124000	2126000	Yeah so they're looking mostly like Texas
2126000	2128000	Arkansas like the southern east
2128000	2130000	Or southeast of the US
2130000	2132000	And apparently
2132000	2134000	They have done something
2134000	2136000	Similar so they're doing the curbside
2136000	2138000	Pick up options as well
2138000	2140000	But
2140000	2142000	There's not really
2142000	2144000	The precautions being taken
2144000	2146000	They've basically said that
2146000	2148000	Yes they're an essential retailer
2148000	2150000	And that they're providing
2150000	2152000	Them with
2152000	2154000	Sanitizing products and stuff like that
2154000	2156000	But much like the whole GameStop thing
2156000	2158000	That's not necessarily
2158000	2160000	Being available
2160000	2162000	And it's not necessarily happening
2162000	2164000	Like they're describing
2164000	2166000	So some of the employees are very frustrated with that
2166000	2168000	Basically saying that they don't want us to
2168000	2170000	Close at all
2170000	2172000	If any employee chooses not to work
2172000	2174000	Then they're told that they will not be paid
2174000	2176000	Since they are not working
2176000	2178000	This even goes for salary managers as well
2180000	2182000	And then of course they're saying
2182000	2184000	We've got the order to shelter
2184000	2186000	In place today from the county judge
2186000	2188000	I hope that the higher ups would do the right thing
2188000	2190000	And not put up a fight
2190000	2192000	And put their employees at health risk
2192000	2194000	But it appears that they have no interest
2194000	2196000	In closing the doors as the pandemic has progressed
2196000	2198000	Corporate has declined
2198000	2200000	To stop practicing
2200000	2202000	Stopping the practice of accepting
2202000	2204000	Trades
2204000	2206000	Our location is located right next door to a medical clinic
2206000	2208000	That takes walk-ins
2208000	2210000	In a time where there's a global pandemic
2210000	2212000	Keeping the specific location
2212000	2214000	Open next door to a place where there are patients
2214000	2216000	With illness is madness
2216000	2218000	Funny enough actually
2218000	2220000	So along with this
2220000	2222000	I saw a follow-up talking about
2222000	2224000	The GameStop practices
2224000	2226000	And what they're instructing their employees to do
2226000	2228000	As far as
2228000	2230000	That delivering to the doorway
2230000	2232000	Type thing
2232000	2234000	So they're literally telling them to
2234000	2236000	Take
2236000	2238000	A GameStop plastic retail bag
2238000	2240000	And just put that around their hand
2240000	2242000	As a glove
2242000	2244000	To be able to hand games
2244000	2246000	And payment methods
2246000	2248000	Back and forth to people
2248000	2250000	It's ridiculous
2250000	2252000	You really
2252000	2254000	Shouldn't be exchanging things like
2254000	2256000	Credit cards and money right now
2256000	2258000	Unless it's at a truly essential business
2258000	2260000	Like a grocery store
2260000	2262000	Even then
2262000	2264000	Now is the time to check out Apple Pay
2264000	2266000	Or Google Pay
2266000	2268000	The contact type transactions
2268000	2270000	Tap to transact type thing
2270000	2272000	Yeah exactly
2272000	2274000	It's ridiculous
2274000	2276000	Apparently
2276000	2278000	They feel that they need to
2278000	2280000	Do this in order to stay open
2280000	2282000	I don't know if it's necessarily just
2282000	2284000	Capitalizing on it or the fact that
2284000	2286000	A lot of these independent retailers
2286000	2288000	Even though this is a pretty sizable one
2288000	2290000	Aren't doing that well
2290000	2292000	If you can think about GameStop struggling
2292000	2294000	And they have direct relationships
2294000	2296000	With all of these publishers
2296000	2298000	Game companies or retailers
2298000	2300000	Like Game Exchange
2300000	2302000	They have to purchase their distribution
2302000	2304000	I know because we used to sell to them
2304000	2306000	So
2306000	2308000	They have it even worse than GameStop
2308000	2310000	As far as being able to get product
2310000	2312000	On time
2312000	2314000	The cost keeping that low
2314000	2316000	And having these special incentives
2316000	2318000	To get people to come into their store
2318000	2320000	So that's even harder for them
2320000	2322000	And if GameStop's
2322000	2324000	Literally running
2324000	2326000	Their business to the ground
2326000	2328000	In fact I think they're closing another 300 locations soon
2328000	2330000	Then
2330000	2332000	It's just gonna
2332000	2334000	Hit them even harder
2334000	2336000	Still shouldn't put employees in danger
2336000	2338000	Because of that, that's ridiculous
2338000	2340000	But it's
2340000	2342000	A very complex situation
2342000	2344000	That really they should be sending those employees home
2344000	2346000	Especially since GameStop did that now
2346000	2348000	To a certain extent
2348000	2350000	If you're thinking of the profits
2350000	2352000	Before the employees
2352000	2354000	Then obviously you're a problem
2354000	2356000	And also
2356000	2358000	What's the pay cut
2358000	2360000	And I say this every time
2360000	2362000	Or the CEO
2362000	2364000	We never hear the talk about that
2364000	2366000	Well actually I will say
2366000	2368000	In non-gaming related things
2368000	2370000	We are starting to see that more and more
2370000	2372000	Like I think we're seeing those articles around social media
2372000	2374000	That there are some companies
2374000	2376000	And of course now that I need to recall them in the moment
2376000	2378000	I can't think of who
2378000	2380000	But there are some companies that are
2380000	2382000	Like the CEO, I was reading one about some CEO
2382000	2384000	That was dropping his pay to 10,000
2384000	2386000	This year
2386000	2388000	To try to use the extra money
2388000	2390000	To make sure they're taken care of and so forth
2390000	2392000	And yes, good job
2392000	2394000	That is what CEOs should be
2394000	2396000	A $10,000 salary
2396000	2398000	Heck, he could take maybe a little more
2398000	2400000	A reasonable salary is fine
2400000	2402000	But use that extra money
2402000	2404000	When you're the type of CEO that's making millions
2404000	2406000	To give back to your employees
2406000	2408000	I think that is
2408000	2410000	All we would like to see somebody do
2410000	2412000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says
2412000	2414000	Devil's advocate
2414000	2416000	What if they're not necessarily thinking of the profits
2416000	2418000	They're just thinking about staying operational
2418000	2420000	With all
2420000	2422000	And that's what I think that they're doing
2422000	2424000	Is trying to stay operational
2424000	2426000	But at the same time
2426000	2428000	Everybody's thinking about that
2428000	2430000	But you can't put your employees in danger
2430000	2432000	To stay operational
2432000	2434000	You just have to
2434000	2436000	Reduce the number of stores you have
2436000	2438000	A responsible upper management team
2438000	2440000	Has a plan
2440000	2442000	Has a pandemic type of plan
2442000	2444000	Or a contingency plan
2444000	2446000	I can tell you every company I've worked for
2446000	2448000	I haven't worked for a lot of companies
2448000	2450000	Because I was with one for 14 years
2450000	2452000	But the companies I did work for
2452000	2454000	Always had a plan for
2454000	2456000	What if we get in a situation
2456000	2458000	Where all the computers go down
2458000	2460000	Or what if we get in a situation
2460000	2462000	And I distinctly remember
2462000	2464000	The first company I worked for for 14 years
2464000	2466000	Which was a major health insurer
2466000	2468000	Because of the fact they were a health care insurer
2468000	2470000	And people are going to want to use health care
2470000	2472000	They had specifically a pandemic plan
2472000	2474000	Granted I haven't worked there in several years
2474000	2476000	So I have no idea if they've actually
2476000	2478000	Enacted that same plan or what
2478000	2480000	But they actually have these types of plans
2480000	2482000	So it is kind of your responsibility
2482000	2484000	As the upper management and the board
2484000	2486000	To be thinking about these types of things
2486000	2488000	You should have had a plan for curbside pickup
2488000	2490000	And all this type of stuff a long time ago
2490000	2492000	Now I realize
2492000	2494000	There's infinite combinations
2494000	2496000	Of things to plan for
2496000	2498000	And not everything's going to be perfect
2498000	2500000	And nobody could have truly predicted this COVID situation
2500000	2502000	I do understand all of that
2502000	2504000	But don't you get the sense
2504000	2506000	Aren't you kind of feeling like
2506000	2508000	Nothing was planned
2508000	2510000	Don't you kind of see those two extremes
2510000	2512000	In this scenario
2512000	2514000	Yes
2514000	2516000	At the same time I do see that
2516000	2518000	And I think it's more
2518000	2520000	They may have been
2520000	2522000	Looking at well GameStop doing it
2522000	2524000	And we can do it as well
2524000	2526000	And that's a lot of the sentiment
2526000	2528000	I used to get with a lot of the independent
2528000	2530000	Retailers that I dealt with
2530000	2532000	Was if GameStop for example
2532000	2534000	Was breaking the street on a title
2534000	2536000	Then they feel well it's fine if we do it then
2536000	2538000	So I think
2538000	2540000	That's kind of what they're looking at here
2540000	2542000	They're basically saying that
2542000	2544000	Oh
2544000	2546000	Well if they're doing it then we can do it
2546000	2548000	Alright
2548000	2550000	Anyway it's a tricky
2550000	2552000	Scenario but I kind of think ultimately
2552000	2554000	The reality of what's going to happen
2554000	2556000	In light of all these
2556000	2558000	Stories that are coming out and things
2558000	2560000	I think this might be the situation
2560000	2562000	That pushes more people to go digital
2562000	2564000	That hadn't considered it before
2564000	2566000	I don't think physical is going away
2566000	2568000	I don't think my opinion has really changed on that
2568000	2570000	Whatsoever but because
2570000	2572000	Just CDs and music
2572000	2574000	That is primarily digital
2574000	2576000	At this point but there are still
2576000	2578000	Collectors and collectibles
2578000	2580000	You can still find
2580000	2582000	Those CDs and so forth they're not as easy to find
2582000	2584000	As they once were but you can still order them
2585000	2587000	I kind of think that is a direction
2587000	2589000	That gaming is kind of headed in
2589000	2591000	Eventually and I think this kind of
2591000	2593000	Accelerates that a little bit
2593000	2595000	Than maybe what we were thinking before
2595000	2597000	We were kind of already thinking
2597000	2599000	That gaming was kind of going that way anyway
2599000	2601000	And I think these two months
2601000	2604000	Of people don't really want to go out to the store
2604000	2606000	I mean there's this
2606000	2608000	GameStop and GameExchange
2608000	2610000	They got their plans on how to stay open
2610000	2612000	But the reality is
2612000	2614000	Speaking for myself
2614000	2616000	I'm not going to a fucking game store right now
2616000	2619000	Either I'm going to get it on Amazon
2619000	2621000	And just wait a few extra days
2621000	2623000	An extra week if I need to
2623000	2625000	Because it's something that's not essential
2625000	2627000	Or maybe even longer than that because it's a game
2627000	2629000	Or I'm just going to buy a digital because
2629000	2631000	You know what that's my other option right now
2631000	2633000	It's not the way I prefer to buy games
2633000	2635000	But if it's something that I have to play
2635000	2637000	Right now like Final Fantasy 7 Remake
2637000	2639000	Then I'll just buy it digital
2639000	2641000	Even though that's not really what I wanted to do
2641000	2643000	Anything else can either wait or you know whatever
2643000	2645000	So
2645000	2647000	Well yeah and I think a lot of major releases
2647000	2649000	Anyways are being pushed back
2649000	2651000	Because of this whole situation so
2651000	2653000	I don't think there's a whole lot of stuff that we have to
2653000	2655000	Jump out and run out to get right now
2655000	2657000	Yeah so Lady Gaga pushed
2657000	2659000	Back her album so you know that was
2659000	2661000	The thing I'm sure you all were waiting for so
2661000	2663000	Now that has been pushed back
2663000	2665000	So yeah I think really
2665000	2667000	Like as far as gaming goes I feel like
2667000	2669000	The Final Fantasy 7 Remake was the only
2669000	2671000	Big thing I was hearing about for April
2671000	2673000	I don't know what April looks like for like triple A titles
2673000	2675000	Maybe some of you guys in chat know more
2675000	2677000	But you know I think
2677000	2679000	I think it was really we're getting
2679000	2681000	I don't think we know a lot of the big stuff
2681000	2683000	Yet because we're in a new console year
2683000	2685000	So I feel like we're still waiting on a lot of the big
2685000	2687000	Console stuff oh is Last of Us 2
2687000	2689000	An April game
2689000	2691000	That's the other one that's escaping my mind
2691000	2693000	Right now was Last of Us 2 an April game
2693000	2695000	Or is that like later does he keep pushing that one back
2695000	2697000	Um I thought
2697000	2699000	I thought that got pushed
2699000	2701000	I thought that was a June game
2701000	2703000	Ok Act F says May
2703000	2705000	I know that I was like what's Playstation got
2705000	2707000	Oh yeah lots of difference
2707000	2709000	Alright well anyway let's move on
2709000	2711000	Let's talk about this story which has to do
2711000	2713000	With kind of a
2713000	2715000	Social media trend gaming
2715000	2717000	Companies coming together to start this
2717000	2719000	Campaign with
2719000	2721000	WHO the World Health Organization
2721000	2723000	So it's kind of interesting to see
2723000	2725000	Official government entities that are
2725000	2727000	Right in the midst of this whole thing coming together
2727000	2729000	With gaming companies to create
2729000	2731000	This awareness of what they're calling
2731000	2733000	Hashtag play a part
2733000	2735000	Together and that's kind of a play on the
2735000	2737000	Word apart because it's
2737000	2739000	Playing games across a distance but
2739000	2741000	You're also playing your part by
2741000	2743000	Staying home and not spreading this
2743000	2745000	Horrible disease so
2745000	2747000	The World Health Organization
2747000	2749000	And the industry have come together to
2749000	2751000	Launch this awareness campaign play a part
2751000	2753000	Together it encourages physical distancing
2753000	2755000	With special events, exclusives
2755000	2757000	Activities, rewards
2757000	2759000	And inspiration for different
2759000	2761000	Popular games. Some of the companies
2761000	2763000	Participating, Activision Blizzard
2763000	2765000	Zynga, one of your favorites I'm sure
2765000	2767000	Big Fish Games
2767000	2769000	Let's see Kabam
2769000	2771000	Pocket Gems, Riot Games is in on this
2771000	2773000	Snap, Twitch
2773000	2775000	Is actually taking part in this because I think
2775000	2777000	Twitch just did their big marathon yesterday right?
2777000	2779000	They had a big thing
2779000	2781000	Going on yesterday
2781000	2783000	The city is also in on this too as is
2783000	2785000	YouTube so there's lots of different types of
2785000	2787000	Elements of gaming that are in on this
2787000	2789000	Trend of
2789000	2791000	Hashtag play a part together
2791000	2793000	And it's interesting
2793000	2795000	Because some journalists are
2795000	2797000	Noting the World Health Organization
2797000	2799000	Just last year was talking
2799000	2801000	About gaming disorder
2801000	2803000	You know people that play too many
2803000	2805000	Video games whereas now
2805000	2807000	It's a little different. A spokesperson
2807000	2809000	The United States ambassador to the
2809000	2811000	World Health Organization Ray Chambers said
2811000	2813000	In a statement that during this
2813000	2815000	Time frame of COVID and everything
2815000	2817000	He applauds what's
2817000	2819000	Quote the ingenuity of partners from
2819000	2821000	All sectors who are stepping up
2821000	2823000	To assist efforts to combat the
2823000	2825000	COVID-19 pandemic
2825000	2827000	So the World Health Organization is trying to get the global
2827000	2829000	Gaming industry to get millions
2829000	2831000	That's another thing to note it's global
2831000	2833000	Gaming is global right? Riot Games has a huge
2833000	2835000	Presence in Asia
2835000	2837000	Many different Asian countries
2837000	2839000	Not just China where we know that
2839000	2841000	COVID is kind of I don't want to say it's
2841000	2843000	Taking its course but we know that the curve is
2843000	2845000	Starting to come down in China but we got all these
2845000	2847000	Other countries like I think I'm not sure
2847000	2849000	Where Taiwan is at
2849000	2851000	Or you know some of these
2851000	2853000	Other places Japan I think was just
2853000	2855000	Well I don't know if Riot Games and League of Legends
2855000	2857000	Is as big there but
2857000	2859000	You know there's just there's other countries
2859000	2861000	Where you know these some of these companies have a big
2861000	2863000	Presence it's not just the US
2863000	2865000	That needs to work on flattening the curve
2865000	2867000	As this virus is spreading around
2867000	2869000	So
2869000	2871000	Also trying to encourage
2871000	2873000	Game players and so forth
2873000	2875000	To follow hand hygiene
2875000	2877000	And physical distancing and
2877000	2879000	So forth so it's kind of
2879000	2881000	It's kind of a neat little awareness campaign
2881000	2883000	I'm very curious to
2883000	2885000	See what these companies start
2885000	2887000	To do like in games and so forth
2887000	2889000	But because they're talking
2889000	2891000	About like maybe like rewards
2891000	2893000	And things to get people to play games online
2893000	2895000	But we'll see as that
2895000	2897000	Develops right now
2897000	2899000	So
2899000	2901000	I'm kind of also curious
2901000	2903000	For those of you out there in the chat room
2903000	2905000	And Loki maybe you have a piece to say on this too
2905000	2907000	It seems like gaming
2907000	2909000	Is just becoming
2909000	2911000	More and more prevalent in these times
2911000	2913000	Anyway like I see a
2913000	2915000	A sizable number of people on Facebook
2915000	2917000	Starting to stream
2917000	2919000	Jackbox games that's a company
2919000	2921000	That's really thriving in light of what's going on
2921000	2923000	Like it's weird to talk about
2923000	2925000	Like oh your company's doing great
2925000	2927000	Because of this horrible situation going on
2927000	2929000	But it is what it is
2929000	2931000	Like I feel like so many people are learning
2931000	2933000	About Jackbox games right now
2933000	2935000	Because more and more people are playing
2935000	2937000	That on Zoom meetings
2937000	2939000	You know with streamer mode
2939000	2941000	And things like that people are getting together to play
2941000	2943000	Jackbox
2943000	2945000	Like my cousin who I didn't even think
2945000	2947000	Ever played video games was posting
2947000	2949000	About this earlier today trying to get people together
2949000	2951000	To play Drawful or something
2951000	2953000	On a stream and so it really does
2953000	2955000	Seem like video games are a great
2955000	2957000	Way for people to be and of course Animal Crossing
2957000	2959000	We talked about earlier in the show
2959000	2961000	Video games have been a great way for people to
2961000	2963000	Still interact even when they're
2963000	2965000	Staying at home
2965000	2967000	Loki have you kind of noticed an upward trend
2967000	2969000	In social media or have you been invited or seen
2969000	2971000	Any of this like online gaming stuff that didn't
2971000	2973000	Really exist previously
2973000	2975000	I mean obviously we've seen a lot of
2975000	2977000	Stories about different
2977000	2979000	Boarding
2979000	2981000	Entities going to their
2981000	2983000	Esports kind of equivalent
2983000	2985000	And doing stuff that way so I think we're going to see
2985000	2987000	A big
2987000	2989000	Especially if it takes off you know
2989000	2991000	A lot more popularity with esports
2991000	2993000	Because of this whole having to
2993000	2995000	Stay away from everybody
2995000	2997000	Yeah definitely I mean I've seen
2997000	2999000	A lot more people playing stuff online
2999000	3001000	I haven't been invited to do anything but
3001000	3003000	That's fine
3003000	3005000	I've just been noticing
3005000	3007000	A lot of people doing that
3007000	3009000	In chat PodCulture says you can play
3009000	3011000	Cards Against Humanity online now
3011000	3013000	Yeah I got I mean there's all sorts
3013000	3015000	Of like Cards Against Humanity like Sims
3015000	3017000	There was one Zizzix it's got a really weird name
3017000	3019000	Somebody invited me to play that the other night
3019000	3021000	So I was playing that for a little bit and that was fun
3021000	3023000	I had the most points too when I left just saying
3023000	3025000	And then that reminds me
3025000	3027000	That same group has been playing Dungeons and Dragons
3027000	3029000	You want to go old school
3029000	3031000	Maybe not so much it's not so much video games
3031000	3033000	But you know tabletop
3033000	3035000	Even have their place right now
3035000	3037000	And I know friends that do
3037000	3039000	Like a weekly or is it monthly
3039000	3041000	They do like a monthly tabletop gaming meetup
3041000	3043000	And so since they couldn't do that this month
3043000	3045000	They did it online and they were playing like
3045000	3047000	Dominion and Catan and those types of things online
3047000	3049000	Because there's a lot of sites where you can
3049000	3051000	Do that so it's kind of interesting to see
3051000	3053000	How people are playing through that
3053000	3055000	Oh and Bobby Blackwolf points out tabletop
3055000	3057000	Simulator even works in VR
3057000	3059000	See Bobby we need clubhouse
3059000	3061000	Games more than ever see by the time clubhouse
3061000	3063000	Games comes out hopefully we're on the other
3063000	3065000	End of this curve and everything and we're
3065000	3067000	Talking about getting back to some sort of normalcy
3067000	3069000	We need clubhouse
3069000	3071000	Games right now dang it so
3071000	3073000	Act Def says the game
3073000	3075000	Show games like Wheel of Fortune
3075000	3077000	And Jeopardy and things like that
3077000	3079000	Good call good call
3079000	3081000	And SHO 100 Matt talking about you know
3081000	3083000	The increased what are the sports channels
3083000	3085000	Doing sports broadcasting networks
3085000	3087000	Are starving for contact and they're turning
3087000	3089000	Or content excuse me and they're turning to
3089000	3091000	Wrestling and sports movies
3091000	3093000	Esports time now to get
3093000	3095000	All the eyes on it yeah and
3095000	3097000	I feel like Twitch there's just so many more
3097000	3099000	People broadcasting on Twitch all at once now
3099000	3101000	Too just because
3101000	3103000	You can't go outside
3103000	3105000	Right now so it's just interesting to see
3105000	3107000	How that's all taken off so anyway
3107000	3109000	Play a part together
3109000	3111000	Interesting awareness campaign for the world
3111000	3113000	Well let's move on with some more news Loki
3113000	3115000	Yeah speaking of more
3115000	3117000	You know campaigns for
3117000	3119000	The whole
3119000	3121000	COVID-19 situation
3121000	3123000	We have games done quick
3123000	3125000	Tackling
3125000	3127000	Some relief for COVID-19
3127000	3129000	With their brand new Corona
3129000	3131000	Relief done quick
3131000	3133000	It's going to be an event that's going to be online
3133000	3135000	Of course from April 17th through the 19th
3135000	3137000	And the
3137000	3139000	I'm assuming all durations
3139000	3141000	Or all donations are going to direct
3141000	3143000	Relief for COVID-19
3143000	3145000	And then of course they're saying that
3145000	3147000	The summer games done quick has been postponed
3147000	3149000	As well it was
3149000	3151000	Originally scheduled for June 21st
3151000	3153000	But now it's being pushed back
3153000	3155000	To August 16th instead
3155000	3157000	Probably
3157000	3159000	A good idea in light of everything going on
3159000	3161000	Yes
3161000	3163000	So
3163000	3165000	Yeah be interesting to see
3165000	3167000	You know what
3167000	3169000	I want to see what they're going to be running in that
3169000	3171000	Yeah and it's going to be interesting to see how that
3171000	3173000	Yeah and it's going to be interesting to see how that's going to all be set up
3173000	3175000	With the social distancing as well
3175000	3177000	Although I believe that channel
3177000	3179000	Has done plenty of speed runs
3179000	3181000	When there's not
3181000	3183000	A hotel convention type of thing going on
3183000	3185000	And they just
3185000	3187000	They do like a remote like they're
3187000	3189000	Hosting somebody else's stream essentially
3189000	3191000	Or maybe doing it through Skype or Discord
3191000	3193000	Video feed or something like that
3193000	3195000	So I'm sure there's plenty of ways to do it
3195000	3197000	So it'll be kind of interesting to see
3197000	3199000	How well received something like that is
3199000	3201000	And it does do very well
3201000	3203000	And then of course I'm sure everybody will be
3203000	3205000	Very much looking forward to getting back together in person
3205000	3207000	And it's funny because
3207000	3209000	Bobby was talking about this a little bit on his show tonight
3209000	3211000	Because as many of you know
3211000	3213000	He applied this year to be one of the hosts
3213000	3215000	Which is very
3215000	3217000	You know we're rooting for him
3217000	3219000	But if he weren't to get it we would understand
3219000	3221000	Because there's tons of people that are
3221000	3223000	Applying to be hosts of these things
3223000	3225000	But he was kind of talking a little bit about
3225000	3227000	You know well if they can do this online
3227000	3229000	There's going to be some people that would say
3229000	3231000	Well do it online all the time but at the same time
3231000	3233000	It kind of loses something like it's
3233000	3235000	There's something about being all in the same room together
3235000	3237000	You know and hearing the big cheers
3237000	3239000	And things like that and
3239000	3241000	I kind of replied to that I was like sounds familiar
3241000	3243000	Because it kind of reminds me of like OLR
3243000	3245000	Like we're able to do this show over Discord
3245000	3247000	But it's
3247000	3249000	It's more fun when it's in person and we can play off each other
3249000	3251000	A lot easier and the laughter is more contagious
3251000	3253000	Than it is over Discord
3253000	3255000	You know so
3256000	3258000	Looking forward to being back to normal soon
3258000	3260000	That's for sure
3260000	3262000	And Bobby Blackwell points out
3262000	3264000	Games Done Quick they do remote speedruns every week
3264000	3266000	They do entire weekend marathons completely online
3266000	3268000	Yeah I figure like I stumbled on one of those marathons once
3268000	3270000	So the
3270000	3272000	Corona thing
3272000	3274000	The speedrun they're going to do for
3274000	3276000	Corona virus relief
3276000	3278000	Efforts and so forth is not going to be
3278000	3280000	Probably a technical challenge whatsoever
3280000	3282000	Hopefully they can get lots of eyes on that
3282000	3284000	I'm sure they'll get support from Twitch though
3284000	3286000	Some front page love and things like that
3286000	3288000	And just general awareness on social media
3288000	3290000	And so forth that they'll get some
3290000	3292000	Good donations for that
3292000	3294000	And Questbuster talking about what's
3294000	3296000	Going on overseas
3296000	3298000	The ESA not to be confused
3298000	3300000	With the E3 people this would be I think it's
3300000	3302000	European speedrunning association I may have got
3302000	3304000	The acronym wrong but essentially that's what it is
3304000	3306000	They just hosted a UK
3306000	3308000	Speedrunning event that finished today and they're
3308000	3310000	Planning an online only week of runs in April
3310000	3312000	As well so
3312000	3314000	And since you can participate globally why not
3314000	3316000	You can check that out too as well if you want
3316000	3318000	So best of luck to everybody involved
3318000	3320000	With games done quick with the Corona
3320000	3322000	Relief efforts
3322000	3324000	Let's talk a little more about Animal Crossing
3324000	3326000	Since it's what a lot of people are talking about
3326000	3328000	Right now but actually what I want to talk
3328000	3330000	About is Animal Crossing Pocket
3330000	3332000	Camp yeah that's not the current
3332000	3334000	One the current one is New Horizons
3334000	3336000	Pocket camp is the cell phone game
3336000	3338000	Remember that one you would think a lot of people
3338000	3340000	Have thrown that app in the garbage now that
3340000	3342000	New Horizons has come out but that's
3342000	3344000	Yes it's hot garbage
3344000	3346000	But that's actually not the case
3346000	3348000	Pocket camp is apparently more popular
3348000	3350000	Than ever maybe because
3350000	3352000	With all this talk of
3352000	3354000	Animal Crossing on social media
3354000	3356000	Not everybody has a switch
3356000	3358000	So maybe some folks are turning to the mobile
3358000	3360000	Version to get their fix a little bit
3360000	3362000	Apparently players spending on March
3362000	3364000	21st a single day
3364000	3366000	Came in at a quarter of a million dollars
3366000	3368000	That was spending in one day
3368000	3370000	That's not bad the game's best day
3370000	3372000	Since March 2nd
3372000	3374000	The game has generated approximately
3374000	3376000	3.6 million dollars for the month
3376000	3378000	Downloads rose by 150
3378000	3380000	Percent and
3380000	3382000	670,000 installs the week
3382000	3384000	Of March 16th which is when the
3384000	3386000	Shelter in place started for many many people
3386000	3388000	So that's pretty
3388000	3390000	Interesting how that game has been getting some
3390000	3392000	Speed but I would bet it's all the people
3392000	3394000	That are like what's this about
3394000	3396000	And they don't have a Nintendo switch so they
3396000	3398000	This is their easiest way to check that out
3398000	3400000	Is through pocket cap
3400000	3402000	Which is a very different Animal Crossing experience
3402000	3404000	I wasn't really into it
3404000	3406000	But that's just me DarkSakura loved it
3406000	3408000	I was not into it it sounded good on paper
3408000	3410000	Animal Crossing on a cell phone
3410000	3412000	Sounds awesome and it was garbage
3412000	3414000	I didn't care for it but again
3414000	3416000	I have other friends that are super into Animal Crossing
3416000	3418000	That love it and I consider myself
3418000	3420000	Like an Animal Crossing fan
3420000	3422000	But I just didn't care for this one
3422000	3424000	I just prefer the Nintendo console based ones
3424000	3426000	And some folks
3426000	3428000	You know in this
3428000	3430000	Interesting day and age of all the different
3430000	3432000	Work from home things
3432000	3434000	You got some people that are using Zoom to work from home
3434000	3436000	Or maybe something like WebEx
3436000	3438000	To get people together or Adobe Connect
3438000	3440000	There's many many different ways to try to bring
3440000	3442000	Co-workers together in this day and age
3442000	3444000	Some people are using Animal Crossing
3444000	3446000	I think this is maybe meant to be
3446000	3448000	A little more parody and not that serious
3448000	3450000	But there was a
3450000	3452000	Japanese company that was posting some of the pros and cons
3452000	3454000	Of working remotely through Animal Crossing
3454000	3456000	And the pro
3456000	3458000	No voice chat
3458000	3460000	Because they have no network features whatsoever
3460000	3462000	Well you can voice chat through the Nintendo app
3462000	3464000	Technically
3464000	3466000	Technically
3466000	3468000	Actually I will give a shout out to the Nintendo app
3468000	3470000	It is proving to be useful for the first time ever
3470000	3472000	Well I don't know maybe some folks thought
3472000	3474000	Splatoon's tie-ins were pretty good
3474000	3476000	But
3476000	3478000	Excuse me
3478000	3480000	For Animal Crossing
3480000	3482000	The fact that you can use the keyboard
3482000	3484000	In the app is very helpful
3484000	3486000	As well as the QR code reader
3486000	3488000	To get different patterns in your
3488000	3490000	Town from the internet, that's very useful as well
3490000	3492000	So if you're playing Animal Crossing and you haven't looked at the
3492000	3494000	Nintendo app
3494000	3496000	You might have forgot that was a thing
3496000	3498000	Get back on that because it is pretty useful
3498000	3500000	But some of the cons
3500000	3502000	The Japanese company says about working from home
3502000	3504000	Via Animal Crossing
3504000	3506000	Can't send files
3506000	3508000	Can't speak about confidential matters
3508000	3510000	Meetings are constantly interrupted by talk
3510000	3512000	Of Animal Crossing
3512000	3514000	And no one is using their real name
3514000	3516000	You know it's funny because I was in a work meeting
3516000	3518000	The other day and people actually asked
3518000	3520000	Like what is something that's making you happy
3520000	3522000	During this time and I actually brought
3522000	3524000	Up Animal Crossing and I was like well a new
3524000	3526000	Animal Crossing game came out and I really love that
3526000	3528000	Game, nobody got it
3528000	3530000	Nobody got it
3530000	3532000	That's unfortunate
3532000	3534000	That is unfortunate because I bet a lot of them would really love it
3534000	3536000	If they saw it
3536000	3538000	I wasn't going to take the time to explain it
3538000	3540000	At this particular juncture
3540000	3542000	So
3542000	3544000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat talking about
3544000	3546000	Zoom and Fortnite
3546000	3548000	I saw a meme where people were using
3548000	3550000	Fortnite and said that the pros over
3550000	3552000	Zoom was that it was more stable voice
3552000	3554000	Chat and you could shoot your co-worker
3554000	3556000	If they were being annoying
3556000	3558000	I like that idea
3558000	3560000	That's very good
3560000	3562000	Alright
3562000	3564000	And Bobby also says I was using Zoom for
3564000	3566000	Four years I'm a Zoom hipster
3566000	3568000	You know what's so fascinating to me
3568000	3570000	My knowledge
3570000	3572000	Of those types of tools
3572000	3574000	From playing Ingress
3574000	3576000	Is coming in really handy right now
3576000	3578000	Because like when we had the big anomaly
3578000	3580000	Here we were doing a lot of planning
3580000	3582000	Stuff with Zoom
3582000	3584000	And so that's a tool I've been using
3584000	3586000	For a long time
3586000	3588000	Because there were other things that had
3588000	3590000	To do with Ingress and meeting people even before then
3590000	3592000	And
3592000	3594000	Slack I've used before
3594000	3596000	And now my company is talking about using
3596000	3598000	Slack in this interim while we're working
3598000	3600000	From home and so I'm like
3600000	3602000	I've used it I can answer some questions
3602000	3604000	Well Slack also is supposed to be
3604000	3606000	Integrating with Microsoft Teams as well pretty soon
3606000	3608000	So you can actually
3608000	3610000	Call somebody on Slack with
3610000	3612000	Microsoft Teams or vice versa
3612000	3614000	We've all jumped on the Microsoft Teams
3614000	3616000	And
3616000	3618000	It's alright
3618000	3620000	Slack's okay
3620000	3622000	I wouldn't want to see our company use it
3622000	3624000	Permanently but it's a nice little like
3624000	3626000	Stand in for now while we can't really see each other
3626000	3628000	I suppose so
3628000	3630000	Anyhow let's
3630000	3632000	Move on with some more stories
3632000	3634000	Loki
3634000	3636000	Yes so this is kind of a random thing
3636000	3638000	They have a brand new
3638000	3640000	Kind of advertising campaign for
3640000	3642000	Sega now
3642000	3644000	You may remember back in the 90s
3644000	3646000	They had the whole
3646000	3648000	Sagata Sanchiro
3648000	3650000	Who was their mascot
3650000	3652000	For the Saturn
3652000	3654000	Well now
3654000	3656000	For Sega's 60th birthday
3656000	3658000	Celebration they have
3658000	3660000	His real life son
3660000	3662000	Mito Fujioka
3662000	3664000	Playing
3664000	3666000	The same character
3666000	3668000	Which is pretty funny
3668000	3670000	So they have this whole thing
3670000	3672000	For Sega's 60th
3672000	3674000	Birthday
3674000	3676000	It's great we should get more
3676000	3678000	Advertising like this for
3678000	3680000	Companies
3680000	3682000	It's very Japanese
3682000	3684000	I just generally miss the
3684000	3686000	Mascots from all the gaming
3686000	3688000	You know all those commercials in the 90s
3688000	3690000	And maybe early 2000s
3690000	3692000	Where like what was the guy that worked
3692000	3694000	For Playstation that was in all the commercials
3694000	3696000	For a while
3696000	3698000	Was kind of the mascot
3698000	3700000	Yeah I don't remember his name
3700000	3702000	You know obviously Sonic was a bit of a
3702000	3704000	Mascot for Sega for a while
3704000	3706000	But that stuff isn't as strong as it used to be
3706000	3708000	You know
3708000	3710000	We need the mascots. Kevin Butler, thank you Act F
3710000	3712000	Yes Kevin Butler
3712000	3714000	He was the greatest fictional vice president
3714000	3716000	Of Sony ever
3716000	3718000	I guess the closest thing we have is
3718000	3720000	Flo from Progressive
3720000	3722000	I guess
3722000	3724000	But that's not gaming
3724000	3726000	We need those gaming mascots
3726000	3728000	To come back like that
3728000	3730000	Questbuster in chat says
3730000	3732000	The Sagata Sanchiro commercials were great
3732000	3734000	That actor's son is taking up the banner too now
3734000	3736000	Well you know sometimes those things
3736000	3738000	Kind of stay in the family. I'm thinking of
3738000	3740000	That social media thing that went around
3740000	3742000	With Mel Brooks' kid
3742000	3744000	And then Mel Brooks was actually in the
3744000	3746000	Bit too but the kid
3746000	3748000	His kid is in his 40s
3748000	3750000	He's probably older than me
3750000	3752000	Was kind of doing a little comedy bit about that whole
3752000	3754000	Thing and that was really great
3754000	3756000	Isn't his name Max?
3756000	3758000	Oh I didn't realize that
3758000	3760000	Bobby Blackwell says his kid wrote World War Z
3760000	3762000	Really? I didn't know that
3762000	3764000	Interesting
3764000	3766000	Well let's move on. Let's take a trip down memory lane
3766000	3768000	Let's look at those classics
3768000	3770000	Shall we? In a segment we call
3770000	3772000	The classic game of the week
3772000	3774000	Where every week on the show
3774000	3776000	We like to take a trip down memory lane to visit
3776000	3778000	A classic game. Usually Dark
3778000	3780000	Sakura would take this on and step into
3780000	3782000	The gaming vault and find a game that she thinks
3782000	3784000	Hey you guys should be checking
3784000	3786000	This game out
3786000	3788000	But she's not here tonight
3788000	3790000	So I'm gonna actually take over for tonight
3790000	3792000	And talk about my classic game choice
3792000	3794000	I think this is one you might like too though
3794000	3796000	Loki. I'm not sure
3796000	3798000	I don't know if this was up your alley but it should be
3798000	3800000	This was actually one of my
3800000	3802000	Favorite arcade games from back in the day
3802000	3804000	It is a game called
3804000	3806000	Ramparts is the game
3806000	3808000	Do you know this game Loki?
3808000	3810000	I do but I'm not a fan
3810000	3812000	Really? I love this game
3812000	3814000	It's from the year
3814000	3816000	1990 okay
3816000	3818000	It's based on that specific
3818000	3820000	Atari arcade hardware
3820000	3822000	Games like 720 and stuff were done on
3822000	3824000	I remember
3824000	3826000	Was it the Nintendo
3826000	3828000	Or Super Nintendo version?
3828000	3830000	They did. There was a Super Nintendo version
3830000	3832000	That used mode 7 if I'm not mistaken
3832000	3834000	And there were two Nintendo versions
3834000	3836000	A lot of people don't know this
3836000	3838000	There was the US version
3838000	3840000	I think Jellico did it in the US
3840000	3842000	And then Konami actually did it in Japan
3842000	3844000	And Konami kind of changed the game
3844000	3846000	A little bit because the game
3846000	3848000	Is kind of like castles and pirate ships
3848000	3850000	Sort of theming
3850000	3852000	And in the
3852000	3854000	Konami NES version they
3854000	3856000	Changed it to like samurai
3856000	3858000	And things like that
3858000	3860000	And I think maybe that's because they were
3860000	3862000	A little more limited in the graphics
3862000	3864000	They didn't really do the ocean as a thing
3864000	3866000	I don't know it's very interesting how they were different
3866000	3868000	But part of what makes Rampart kind of unique
3868000	3870000	Is
3870000	3872000	Rampart they say
3872000	3874000	They were credited anyway with being kind of a precursor
3874000	3876000	To tower defense games
3876000	3878000	Because essentially that's what it was
3878000	3880000	You were protecting towers
3880000	3882000	As they were being attacked by little peons
3882000	3884000	That would come try to attack them
3884000	3886000	The peons were coming from these ships
3886000	3888000	That were also attacking your towers
3888000	3890000	With cannonballs
3890000	3892000	And so the game was split up into different phases
3892000	3894000	And for those of you that are watching along on Twitch
3894000	3896000	You can kind of see these different phases play out
3896000	3898000	One is you place the cannons
3898000	3900000	Within your forts
3900000	3902000	One is it's a free for all battle
3902000	3904000	Between cannonballs
3904000	3906000	So you're firing on the pirate ships
3906000	3908000	They're firing on your castles
3908000	3910000	The next phase after that is
3910000	3912000	Put back together your castles
3912000	3914000	And so it's like a Tetris kind of style
3914000	3916000	You have Tetris like pieces
3916000	3918000	And you have to be able to surround
3918000	3920000	At least one of your castle buildings
3920000	3922000	With a bunch of Tetris pieces
3922000	3924000	If you can't do that it's game over
3924000	3926000	So you'll notice on the Twitch stream for those of you watching
3926000	3928000	This guy right now is trying to surround
3928000	3930000	In one bit and he did it there
3930000	3932000	And he's got another one that's a little smaller
3932000	3934000	So you can see he's kind of trying to build that together
3934000	3936000	For those listening on the podcast you'll just have to imagine it
3936000	3938000	But it's very easy to find gameplay of this game if you're interested
3938000	3940000	And yes it's playable in MAME
3940000	3942000	Which I know a lot of people
3942000	3944000	Check out their arcade games out that way
3944000	3946000	But it is a neat little game
3948000	3950000	In the original game there are six different levels
3950000	3952000	Where you're attacking different ships
3952000	3954000	And then trying to repair the damage
3954000	3956000	And it's built into those different phases
3956000	3958000	There is a multiplayer version of the game
3958000	3960000	At least the arcade version has it
3960000	3962000	Not all of the home ports have it
3962000	3964000	But some of them do
3964000	3966000	Interestingly enough I believe Konami's NES version
3966000	3968000	Is one of the ones that has it
3968000	3970000	Sounds like it's one of those cases where the Japanese
3970000	3972000	Port of the game was a little bit stronger
3972000	3974000	If you are playing with two or three people
3974000	3978000	The arcade version had blue, red, and yellow teams
3978000	3980000	It was a rare three player arcade game
3980000	3982000	Except instead of fighting against ships
3982000	3984000	You're fighting against each other
3984000	3986000	You're fighting against each other
3986000	3988000	Your land is separated by a river
3988000	3990000	And you're trying to blow each other's stuff up
3990000	3992000	So that's kind of fun
3992000	3994000	So yeah some of the strategy for this game
3994000	3996000	It's easier to capture an unowned castle
3996000	3998000	Than try to repair the wall around a starting castle
3998000	4000000	But if you kind of build close to the water
4000000	4002000	You can have better aim
4002000	4004000	So there's lots of little tricks and techniques
4004000	4006000	To go into this
4006000	4008000	I was never very good at it
4008000	4010000	I just thought it was kind of fun to try to build
4010000	4012000	The biggest surrounding piece of land I could
4012000	4014000	Where has this game been ported?
4014000	4016000	Everywhere in the 90s
4016000	4018000	It was on the Super Nintendo, the Master System
4018000	4020000	The Mega Drive, Genesis, Atari Lynx
4020000	4022000	PC, Macintosh, Commodore 64
4022000	4024000	Amiga, Atari ST, Game Boy, Game Boy Color
4024000	4026000	There's a lot of different ports
4026000	4028000	And if that's not enough for you
4028000	4030000	It was also included in the
4030000	4032000	Midway Arcade Treasures compilation
4032000	4036000	So if you have a Midway compilation
4036000	4038000	That was either on the GameCube
4038000	4040000	The Playstation 2, the Xbox, or the Playstation Portable
4040000	4042000	This game is on it
4042000	4044000	And if you have the later
4044000	4046000	Arcade Origins series
4046000	4048000	That was on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360
4048000	4050000	This game is on there as well
4050000	4052000	And
4052000	4054000	I mean they've done this game a lot haven't they
4054000	4056000	If you bought Gauntlet on the Game Boy Advance
4056000	4058000	This game was there as well
4058000	4060000	It was kind of like the B-side
4060000	4062000	Like when they did Final Fight
4062000	4064000	And Magic Sword together
4064000	4066000	And I was more about Magic Sword
4066000	4068000	But it was kind of the B-side
4068000	4070000	So Rampart was available in Gauntlet
4070000	4072000	On the Game Boy Advance as well
4072000	4074000	There's also some open source games
4074000	4076000	That are basically clones of Rampart
4076000	4078000	Kajani Combat and Castle Combat
4078000	4080000	Are two of the names of those
4080000	4082000	So kind of neat
4082000	4084000	And yeah I really
4084000	4086000	And they say this is kind of an influencer
4086000	4088000	Of the tower defense genre
4088000	4090000	So yeah one of my very favorite
4090000	4092000	Kind of like puzzle games
4092000	4094000	I don't know like it does
4094000	4096000	Get a little bit old after a while
4096000	4098000	But it is kind of like it's so unique
4098000	4100000	That I can't help but if I actually
4100000	4102000	Find one of these machines
4102000	4104000	I don't think they made a ton of these in the arcade
4104000	4106000	So I don't see them very often
4106000	4108000	But if I do see one I really have to play around
4108000	4110000	For it so there you go
4110000	4112000	Dark Tetsuya says
4112000	4114000	I think there's a Japanese Famicom
4114000	4116000	Version of this too
4116000	4118000	Yeah I was mentioning that a little earlier
4118000	4120000	Is that Konami made the Japanese version
4120000	4122000	Whereas Jellico made the
4122000	4124000	US version
4124000	4126000	So it's kind of like Tetris
4126000	4128000	Where there was two different versions of it on the NES
4128000	4130000	Questbuster says
4130000	4132000	My castles are fugly because I had no idea what I was doing
4132000	4134000	Same though
4134000	4136000	And Questbuster says I loved watching someone else play it
4136000	4138000	So I could see the cannons in action
4138000	4140000	Especially if the arcade cab had its volume up
4140000	4142000	Oh and something that really should
4142000	4144000	One thing I need to mention about this game
4144000	4146000	Before we close up
4146000	4148000	It ran on a trackball
4148000	4150000	So you're placing all these pieces
4150000	4152000	You're firing all the cannons
4152000	4154000	They sold conversion kits for this
4154000	4156000	I think it would run on an old 720 machine
4156000	4158000	Or I'm trying to think of the other
4158000	4160000	Trackball Atari games
4160000	4162000	From around this era
4162000	4164000	But yeah it was actually a trackball game
4164000	4166000	And I think that's important to say because if you do end up playing a clone
4166000	4168000	Or whatever it really helps
4168000	4170000	To have a mouse
4170000	4172000	So when you are playing it on Super Nintendo
4172000	4174000	Or even regular Nintendo
4174000	4176000	You're not really able to play it with a mouse
4176000	4178000	Or did this game support
4178000	4180000	The mouse peripheral
4180000	4182000	I don't think so
4182000	4184000	I think it was an NES game
4184000	4186000	I'm pretty sure
4186000	4188000	It was on both
4188000	4190000	Because the Super Nintendo one had mode 7
4190000	4192000	Where you could actually see your land
4192000	4194000	In mode 7 and it was kind of cool
4194000	4196000	Because it was like ooh I built that and I'm seeing it in mode 7
4196000	4198000	So that's kind of neat
4198000	4200000	Anyway there it is your classic game of the week
4200000	4202000	One of my old school faves
4202000	4204000	From the arcades in the 1990s
4204000	4206000	Rampart
4206000	4208000	There you go my pick
4208000	4210000	I know that Sakura wasn't here to pick tonight
4210000	4212000	But hopefully she'll be back next week
4212000	4214000	And we'll get a pick from her
4214000	4216000	Although next week will be April
4216000	4218000	So she might do a pinball game
4218000	4220000	Stay tuned we'll see
4220000	4222000	For now let's move on and travel around the world quickly
4222000	4224000	With some rapid fire news of what's going on in the industry
4224000	4226000	Loki
4226000	4228000	So since we're getting a lot of people watching Netflix
4228000	4230000	It's I guess appropriate that we have some Netflix news
4230000	4232000	So there's I guess
4232000	4234000	Information going on saying that
4234000	4236000	Netflix is looking to develop
4236000	4238000	A series
4238000	4240000	And they're looking to have Ryan Reynolds
4240000	4242000	Set to produce and star in
4242000	4244000	I don't know if it's going to be a series or a film
4244000	4246000	But at the very least something
4246000	4248000	So
4248000	4250000	Interesting to see
4250000	4252000	I'd like to see that
4252000	4254000	But I don't know
4254000	4256000	Live action is going to lose some of its
4256000	4258000	Charm I think
4258000	4260000	But whatever
4260000	4262000	I guess we'll have to see what happens
4262000	4264000	I thought I had heard that it might be a half and half thing
4264000	4266000	Even though the Dark Sakura is not here
4266000	4268000	I had to throw out a Xanadu reference
4268000	4270000	For her
4270000	4272000	As long as we get a Netflix adaptation
4272000	4274000	Of Brain Dead 13 then I'll be good too
4274000	4276000	I guess Space Ace will have to do that as well
4276000	4278000	And then of course
4278000	4280000	Speaking of Netflix
4280000	4282000	Castlevania the animated series
4282000	4284000	Is getting a fourth season
4284000	4286000	So that's pretty awesome
4286000	4288000	And then
4288000	4290000	Of course
4290000	4292000	And then of course
4292000	4294000	So that's pretty awesome
4294000	4296000	Apparently
4296000	4298000	I guess the third season just came out
4298000	4300000	At the beginning of this month
4300000	4302000	So no date yet
4302000	4304000	When the fourth one is going to be coming
4304000	4306000	But I'm glad to see that it's doing well
4306000	4308000	I have not really watched that series
4308000	4310000	I think I may have watched an episode of it
4310000	4312000	But I mean it sounds like it's been
4312000	4314000	Doing pretty well
4314000	4316000	Yeah most people that have been watching it
4316000	4318000	Have said good things about it
4318000	4320000	So it's one of those things
4320000	4322000	But speaking of time sinks
4322000	4324000	You know what else got renewed on Netflix
4324000	4326000	Which is really exciting
4326000	4328000	It has nothing to do with video gaming
4328000	4330000	But it's a game of sorts
4330000	4332000	The Circle got renewed for seasons 2 and 3
4332000	4334000	So that is really exciting news
4334000	4336000	As did Love is Blind
4336000	4338000	Got renewed for seasons 2 and 3
4338000	4340000	Both those shows are crazy
4340000	4342000	Tiger King
4342000	4344000	Isn't Tiger King like a documentary?
4344000	4346000	Maybe they can't do a season 2
4346000	4348000	But I'm sure they'll try to figure out a way to do it
4348000	4350000	They found a way to do more seasons of Making a Murder
4350000	4352000	So we'll see
4352000	4354000	But
4354000	4356000	Yeah so there's those
4356000	4358000	The Circle also has
4358000	4360000	If you're really into that show on Netflix
4360000	4362000	The Brazil one just came out
4362000	4364000	And because Netflix is international
4364000	4366000	You can watch The Circle Brazil
4366000	4368000	With English subtitles
4368000	4370000	So it's kind of like having another season of The Circle
4370000	4372000	And apparently there is a French one coming to this
4372000	4374000	The Circle France is coming as well
4374000	4376000	If you're a fan of that crap
4376000	4378000	Like me
4378000	4380000	Alright anyway
4380000	4382000	Bobby Blackwolf says they're doing a season 2 of Tiger King
4382000	4384000	It's going to be scripted
4384000	4386000	Kate McKinnon is in it
4386000	4388000	She's playing the woman
4388000	4390000	No way
4390000	4392000	Isn't that just something they're talking about on Twitter
4392000	4394000	Because like Dax Shepard is saying
4394000	4396000	Like he has to be the main guy
4396000	4398000	In the movie version
4398000	4400000	Or the inevitable version of this
4400000	4402000	And then what's
4402000	4404000	Edward Norton wanted to fight him for the part
4404000	4406000	It's like crazy
4406000	4408000	Oh that sounds ridiculous
4408000	4410000	Yeah anyway
4410000	4412000	Wow he's linking me
4412000	4414000	He's bringing the receipts
4414000	4416000	He's linking me to a Deadline article
4416000	4418000	Apparently there is a Joe Exotic
4418000	4420000	Limited series starring Kate McKinnon
4420000	4422000	You gotta be
4422000	4424000	shitting me
4424000	4426000	Oh because this all got rolling
4426000	4428000	Back in November
4428000	4430000	And now interest in the project
4430000	4432000	Is picked up again because of what's going on
4432000	4434000	With the Netflix series
4434000	4436000	Interesting
4436000	4438000	So it may not necessarily be tied to Netflix though
4438000	4440000	But it probably will end up there
4440000	4442000	We'll see
4442000	4444000	Alright well anyway
4444000	4446000	On to other rapid fire news
4446000	4448000	Let's talk about Streets of Rage 4
4448000	4450000	Because I know some people only care about
4450000	4452000	Streets of Rage 4 because they want to hear new
4452000	4454000	Yuzo Koshiro music on the soundtrack
4454000	4456000	I don't say I can blame you
4456000	4458000	I'm in a very similar position
4458000	4460000	And the good news is you will be able to get the soundtrack
4460000	4462000	Or if you're a vinyl hipster
4462000	4464000	Which is completely understandable
4464000	4466000	You can get the vinyl in summer of 2020
4466000	4468000	And that will be a lot of fun as well
4468000	4470000	So yes it has been confirmed that Streets of Rage 4
4470000	4472000	OST will get a digital release
4472000	4474000	On the same day as the game launches
4474000	4476000	What day is that?
4476000	4478000	We still don't know
4478000	4480000	They're just saying it will be the same day
4480000	4482000	Soon
4482000	4484000	That's right
4484000	4486000	Last week we talked about the Humble Brag
4486000	4488000	Which was the Humble Bundles version of Nintendo Direct
4488000	4490000	Yeah I checked that out
4490000	4492000	It happened
4492000	4494000	And what did you think?
4494000	4496000	Well let me quickly mention
4496000	4498000	Some of the things they talked about
4498000	4500000	Their publishing arm is going to be getting
4500000	4502000	One Step from Eden on PC and Switch
4502000	4504000	Fae Tactics as well
4504000	4506000	And then they talked about some partnerships
4506000	4508000	Including Wildfire which is a stealth game
4508000	4510000	Ambition, A Minuet of Power
4510000	4512000	Which is a roguelike
4512000	4514000	Proteus, not to be confused with Parodius
4514000	4516000	Which is a sci-fi first person shooter
4516000	4518000	Ring of Pain, a roguelike
4518000	4520000	With card game pacing
4520000	4522000	And The Iron Oath
4522000	4524000	A turn based RPG in a dark fantasy world
4524000	4526000	You actually watched it Loki, what did you think?
4526000	4528000	It was okay
4528000	4530000	I've been interested in Proteus a bit
4530000	4532000	I was kind of disappointed that not everything
4532000	4534000	That they were showing was stuff that's right around the corner
4534000	4536000	But
4536000	4538000	I mean it looked okay
4538000	4540000	I thought they were going to have some
4540000	4542000	Really amazing announcements
4542000	4544000	But it was alright
4544000	4546000	More Proteus footage is good
4546000	4548000	I think we're definitely going to see more and more companies
4548000	4550000	That are kind of doing this
4550000	4552000	As time goes on, that's for sure
4552000	4554000	Alright
4554000	4556000	Well let us move on and talk about
4556000	4558000	World release dates and what is coming out
4558000	4560000	In a country near you very soon
4560000	4562000	So starting with the US?
4562000	4564000	Not a whole lot, but we've got Bubble Bobble 4
4564000	4566000	Friends on Nintendo Switch
4566000	4568000	Persona 5
4568000	4570000	Royale on Playstation 4
4570000	4572000	My friend
4572000	4574000	Pedro on Playstation 4
4574000	4576000	And then last but not least
4576000	4578000	Resident Evil 3
4578000	4580000	On PC, Playstation 4
4580000	4582000	And Xbox One
4582000	4584000	Alright, traveling to Japan
4584000	4586000	And checking out the releases there
4586000	4588000	On the Playstation 4
4588000	4590000	Biohazard 3
4590000	4592000	Which of course is Resident Evil 3
4592000	4594000	That remake is getting its release on Playstation 4
4594000	4596000	On April the 3rd
4596000	4598000	That is a regular version and a Z version
4598000	4600000	Is coming out there
4600000	4602000	Shovel Knight also getting its Japanese release
4602000	4604000	This week, so that's kind of fun
4604000	4606000	I'm guessing that's a localized version
4606000	4608000	It may have already come out digitally
4608000	4610000	But this is a physical version
4610000	4612000	That's coming out as well
4612000	4614000	Over on the Nintendo Switch, also seeing
4614000	4616000	Shovel Knight as well
4616000	4618000	Kotoba no Puzzle
4618000	4620000	Is a game as well
4620000	4622000	I don't know what the hell this is
4622000	4624000	Pika Pika Nurse Monogatari
4624000	4626000	Now I know you might think
4626000	4628000	That that is some type of Pikachu thing
4628000	4630000	But it's not, it's like a
4630000	4632000	Nursing simulator type of game
4632000	4634000	So, and that is
4634000	4636000	It's like Nursing Mama
4636000	4638000	Basically, so, yeah
4638000	4640000	Because you get to actually examine patients
4640000	4642000	But it's all cute and chibi
4642000	4644000	So, interesting
4644000	4646000	So that's out this week
4646000	4648000	And then there's a brand new Nintendo Switch Lite
4648000	4650000	Color coming out in Japan
4650000	4652000	A Nintendo Switch Lite Coral version
4652000	4654000	Is out, so
4654000	4656000	Fun fun
4656000	4658000	Okay, Logi
4658000	4660000	In the UK we've got
4660000	4662000	Onanaki, that's coming out on
4662000	4664000	PlayStation 4 and Switch
4664000	4666000	Zombie Army Trilogy
4666000	4668000	On a Nintendo Switch
4668000	4670000	Persona 5 Royale
4670000	4672000	On PlayStation 4
4672000	4674000	Super Epic on PlayStation 4
4674000	4676000	And Switch
4676000	4678000	Resident Evil 3
4678000	4680000	On PlayStation 4 and Xbox One
4680000	4682000	And that's it
4682000	4684000	Alrighty
4684000	4686000	Let's move on to our mailbag
4686000	4688000	Every week you guys send us emails
4688000	4690000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
4690000	4692000	And we read some of our favorites here on the show
4692000	4694000	Although I'm sad to say yet again
4694000	4696000	It looks like our mailbag was kind of empty
4696000	4698000	So we don't have any emails to read
4698000	4700000	But I will go to our Twitter
4700000	4702000	Account because we do
4702000	4704000	Field your tweets as well
4704000	4706000	At OLR over on Twitter
4706000	4708000	And we do have a tweet coming in this week
4708000	4710000	From Flaco Jones who tweeted us
4710000	4712000	Saying, we haven't heard from Flaco
4712000	4714000	In a while. Hello Flaco, I hope you're well
4714000	4716000	Flaco says, hey OLR
4716000	4718000	My wife has been spending the bulk of her gaming time
4718000	4720000	During the pandemic lockdown
4720000	4722000	Playing Wind Waker HD
4722000	4724000	And she just talked to
4724000	4726000	A certain someone very special
4726000	4728000	To your show
4728000	4730000	And attached is a gif image of
4730000	4732000	Tingle
4732000	4734000	You can't even see that, whatever
4734000	4736000	Sorry, I was holding it up to the camera
4736000	4738000	Tingle has made an appearance
4738000	4740000	In Wind Waker HD
4740000	4742000	Good choice to catch up on the gaming backlog
4742000	4744000	You know, speaking of Zelda
4744000	4746000	I know several people that have kind of
4746000	4748000	Restarted or picked up again
4748000	4750000	Their Breath of the Wild games
4750000	4752000	Because you know, talk about a game that you sink a lot of hours into
4752000	4754000	That's another big one as well
4754000	4756000	Loki, any thoughts on
4756000	4758000	Wind Waker HD and
4758000	4760000	Tingle appearance?
4760000	4762000	I already made my comment on that
4762000	4764000	Oh, what did you say? I missed it
4764000	4766000	I replied, dislike
4766000	4768000	Dislike, whatever
4768000	4770000	Don't be a hater
4770000	4772000	Alright, so anyhow, there you go
4772000	4774000	So in lack of
4774000	4776000	Emails this week, at least we got a tweet
4776000	4778000	And I will be encouraging more folks to send us
4778000	4780000	Tweets for future weeks, because
4780000	4782000	If we're going to continue to have an empty mailbag
4782000	4784000	Then we're going to change this segment
4784000	4786000	A little bit, I'm not sure I'm going to delete the
4786000	4788000	Mailbag, but we're going to
4788000	4790000	Kind of open it up to other
4790000	4792000	Feedback mechanisms as well, so
4792000	4794000	Mails and tweets, I suppose
4794000	4796000	Don't make us go
4796000	4798000	Late 90s, early 2000s
4798000	4800000	Participate or die
4800000	4802000	No, no, I mean
4802000	4804000	You know, the reality is
4804000	4806000	Less and less people use
4806000	4808000	Email, because more and more
4808000	4810000	People use social media
4810000	4812000	And I think this is just one of those, maybe we have to
4812000	4814000	Evolve type of things, because
4814000	4816000	People just aren't really using their email accounts
4816000	4818000	Like they used to, but it's very easy to send a tweet
4818000	4820000	And you know, I
4820000	4822000	Probably should dust off the Facebook
4822000	4824000	And try to get some more posts on there
4824000	4826000	It's hard for me to put together this show
4826000	4828000	And be the social media guy, so
4828000	4830000	You know, we'll see, we'll do it again
4830000	4832000	So, alright
4832000	4834000	Dark Tetsuya says, just do what you did with
4834000	4836000	FUs, make it as needed if we do
4836000	4838000	Get any. The difference between this and FUs
4838000	4840000	Though is that, you know, this is the show where every gamer
4840000	4842000	Has a voice, and especially right now
4842000	4844000	Where we're having to use Discord to do the show, so we're not
4844000	4846000	Really doing calls on Discord
4846000	4848000	And we weren't really getting a lot of those
4848000	4850000	Either, I think we just need to rethink
4850000	4852000	Some of the ways that we're letting people participate
4852000	4854000	And so, you know what I need to do
4854000	4856000	I just need to open an Animal Crossing
4856000	4858000	Town during the show, and you can participate
4858000	4860000	By coming to visit and saying
4860000	4862000	Your message is there. That's staying
4862000	4864000	On top of trends, right? So, anyway
4864000	4866000	Hey, I'm open to ideas
4866000	4868000	If you think there's a way we should be
4868000	4870000	Getting more folks to interact with our show that we're not doing
4870000	4872000	Tweet me, email me
4872000	4874000	Anything, text me
4874000	4876000	If you know my number, I'll take anything
4876000	4878000	So, alright
4878000	4880000	Ooh, so
4880000	4882000	So, you want to talk about participation
4882000	4884000	Bobby just got some late-breaking news
4884000	4886000	For himself, Bobby said
4886000	4888000	In chat, breaking news
4888000	4890000	He has Tommy Tallarico coming on his show
4890000	4892000	Next week
4892000	4894000	From television, yeah
4894000	4896000	So, when are we going to be starting the show?
4896000	4898000	Like, 8 o'clock at night?
4898000	4900000	Do we get a show next week, Bobby?
4900000	4902000	Have we been bumped?
4902000	4904000	I don't know, no, I'm kind of
4904000	4906000	Serious, what happens now to OLR
4906000	4908000	Because he's not going to hold
4908000	4910000	Himself to an hour
4910000	4912000	We're going to have to figure that out
4912000	4914000	I did see the new video that he posted
4914000	4916000	About the Intellivision
4916000	4918000	With the new game series showing off
4918000	4920000	And stuff like that
4920000	4922000	In the controller
4922000	4924000	Showing off Missile Command, I believe
4924000	4926000	Yeah, I saw the Missile Command video as well
4926000	4928000	I think they're very committed to that idea
4928000	4930000	Which is, you know
4930000	4932000	Some may say is the wrong idea right now
4932000	4934000	In the time of Coronavirus
4934000	4936000	But hopefully by the time this thing is out
4936000	4938000	Coronavirus is a memory
4938000	4940000	God, let's hope so
4940000	4942000	And I think maybe more than ever
4942000	4944000	People will want to hang out in person again
4944000	4946000	Because they're going to realize how much they missed it
4946000	4948000	Because I will say
4948000	4950000	Even though the games are not
4950000	4952000	Packing the oomph
4952000	4954000	In processing power of something like
4954000	4956000	Nintendo Switch or Playstation 4
4956000	4958000	What have you
4958000	4960000	It seems like the ideas they've committed to
4960000	4962000	They're executing fairly well
4962000	4964000	Like the fact that the controller works on your phone
4964000	4966000	As well as the
4966000	4968000	You know, regular Bluetooth controller
4968000	4970000	Like that looks like it's
4970000	4972000	You know, that Missile Command game they were playing
4972000	4974000	The foreplayer looked very fast paced
4974000	4976000	And it looked like it was doing very well
4976000	4978000	So it's kind of interesting
4980000	4982000	Yeah, it looked pretty cool
4982000	4984000	Yeah, so I'm looking
4984000	4986000	Some folks in chat, OLR starting late
4986000	4988000	OLR cancelled next week
4988000	4990000	Bobby says
4990000	4992000	I'll try to wrap it at an hour
4992000	4994000	We'll figure it out
4994000	4996000	We're just joking
4996000	4998000	Well, here's the thing too
4998000	5000000	Honestly, if there's any time
5000000	5002000	To screw with our times
5002000	5004000	What else do we have going on
5004000	5006000	The nice thing is
5006000	5008000	Loki and Dark Sakura aren't driving
5008000	5010000	To get here at a certain time
5010000	5012000	So if we do end up with a 6.30 start time
5012000	5014000	It's not the end of the world
5014000	5016000	We'll talk about it offline
5016000	5018000	But I'm excited for you
5018000	5020000	That'll be a fun interview
5020000	5022000	Alright, let's move on
5022000	5024000	Loki, you have another piece of news for us
5024000	5026000	Yes, so
5026000	5028000	As we were kind of alluding to earlier
5028000	5030000	With all the sports
5030000	5032000	Being kind of
5032000	5034000	Postponed right now
5034000	5036000	So NASCAR is another thing
5036000	5038000	That's now going to be
5038000	5040000	Kind of like an eSports coverage
5040000	5042000	So they're gonna
5042000	5044000	Do their first NASCAR
5044000	5046000	They had their first NASCAR
5046000	5048000	Virtual race over the weekend
5048000	5050000	And now I guess
5050000	5052000	Fox and NASCAR have decided
5052000	5054000	That they're gonna broadcast a whole season
5054000	5056000	Of it on TV
5056000	5058000	And this is kind of similar to I guess
5058000	5060000	What Formula One's been doing
5060000	5062000	We talked about that last week
5062000	5064000	So it's gonna be the E-Nascar iRacing Pro
5064000	5066000	Invitation Series event
5066000	5068000	Interesting
5068000	5070000	I mean, like I said
5070000	5072000	This is kind of neat that
5072000	5074000	eSports is kind of gonna be a thing
5074000	5076000	That's coming more mainstream
5076000	5078000	With different sporting
5078000	5080000	Events going to
5080000	5082000	Their kind of electronic equivalents
5082000	5084000	It's also fascinating to me that you have
5084000	5086000	The professional sports players for being able to
5086000	5088000	Do the physical sports that are kind of
5088000	5090000	Transitioning to the eSports side of things
5090000	5092000	When it comes to these, you know, very
5092000	5094000	Intense simulators like iRacing
5094000	5096000	You know, because that's supposed to really
5096000	5098000	Simulate the kind of NASCAR experience
5098000	5100000	Versus the other kind of
5100000	5102000	Traditional eSports athlete that learned
5102000	5104000	To play said game
5104000	5106000	Because maybe it's not based on some
5106000	5108000	Well, even, I would say even something like Madden
5108000	5110000	Falls into this category
5110000	5112000	Madden is based off a sport in the real world
5112000	5114000	And some might even call it a simulation
5114000	5116000	But it doesn't really
5116000	5118000	Play like it, if that makes sense
5118000	5120000	You know, like they're very, very different
5120000	5122000	Whereas I think when we talk about something like
5122000	5124000	The iRacer, there's probably a lot
5124000	5126000	That goes into it
5126000	5128000	I'm not familiar with it myself, but I imagine
5128000	5130000	It's like the Microsoft Flight Simulator
5130000	5132000	Of car racing where every, you know, nut and bolt
5132000	5134000	Is kind of represented there
5134000	5136000	You know what I mean, whereas in Madden, it's kind of
5136000	5138000	Has to be dumbed down
5138000	5140000	And I'm using my quotey fingers, I'm not saying that
5140000	5142000	In a negative way
5142000	5144000	For a controller, you know
5144000	5146000	And the fact that you're not
5146000	5148000	Exerting physically in the same way
5148000	5150000	If that makes sense, so
5150000	5152000	But yeah, Bobby Blackwell says iRacing is what
5152000	5154000	The drivers use to train when they can't get on a track
5154000	5156000	As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat over at
5156000	5158000	Twitch TV slash VOG Network says
5158000	5160000	The NHL is simming the rest of their
5160000	5162000	Season, I almost said slimming, but it's
5162000	5164000	Simming the rest of their season
5164000	5166000	In NHL 20, complete with
5166000	5168000	Players of the day and stat updates
5168000	5170000	The team Twitter accounts are getting into it as well
5170000	5172000	What else can you do
5172000	5174000	Because, you know, when you don't
5174000	5176000	Have games, you don't
5176000	5178000	Have the visibility
5178000	5180000	You don't have the shirts
5180000	5182000	And the merchandising and that stuff
5182000	5184000	Necessarily selling at the same pace
5184000	5186000	I'm sure there's always going to be diehard fans
5186000	5188000	That are looking for that stuff, but it's not going to be selling at the same pace
5188000	5190000	So it's like anything that you can do
5190000	5192000	To get people to be like, hey, remember
5192000	5194000	Hockey, like, it's
5194000	5196000	Going to be something they're going to try
5196000	5198000	So, be interesting
5198000	5200000	It's just, it is
5200000	5202000	Going to be so fascinating, the
5202000	5204000	Economic ripple that this is all
5204000	5206000	Going to have, and I'm not trying to say it in like
5206000	5208000	A doom and gloom type of way
5208000	5210000	But I mean, look at
5210000	5212000	Like Disney parks being shut down
5212000	5214000	For six weeks, that's
5214000	5216000	Which is what we're looking at at this point
5216000	5218000	I haven't officially said the reopening date
5218000	5220000	But that's like crazy and unheard of, right?
5220000	5222000	So like Disney
5222000	5224000	Disney's going to lose like six weeks
5224000	5226000	Of park income, do you know how much money that is?
5226000	5228000	That's a lot of money
5228000	5230000	It's a lot of fucking money
5230000	5232000	Now a company like Disney has multiple
5232000	5234000	TV networks, movie studios and other things
5234000	5236000	To kind of like keep them afloat
5236000	5238000	So I'm not worried like, oh my god, Disney's going to go under
5238000	5240000	But it's going to be like a rough transition
5240000	5242000	I think for a lot of companies
5242000	5244000	Anyway, I don't want to burden us too much
5244000	5246000	With the real world stuff, but I would just say
5246000	5248000	When we get back to the real world
5248000	5250000	When it's safe to do so
5250000	5252000	It's going to be like driving on a road
5252000	5254000	That hasn't been paved in a little while
5254000	5256000	You'll get to the destination
5256000	5258000	It's going to be a little bumpy
5258000	5260000	There's going to be some potholes
5260000	5262000	It'll be interesting
5262000	5264000	Yeah, Act Efton Chat says
5264000	5266000	We're not talking millions, we're talking billions
5266000	5268000	Yeah, that's true, that is very true
5268000	5270000	As Joe and Hunter Matt points out at six weeks
5270000	5272000	For domestic parks, some of the international parks
5272000	5274000	Have been closed for months now
5274000	5276000	So, we shall see
5276000	5278000	Alright, anyhow
5278000	5280000	Well, one interesting
5280000	5282000	Case of gaming worlds
5282000	5284000	Hopefully reflecting
5284000	5286000	What might happen in the real world
5286000	5288000	Is that right now
5288000	5290000	House evictions are being halted
5290000	5292000	In Final Fantasy XIV
5292000	5294000	And I play a lot of Final Fantasy XIV
5294000	5296000	So let me kind of tell you what this really means
5296000	5298000	Because player housing is very highly contested
5298000	5300000	In Final Fantasy XIV
5300000	5302000	Because there's only so much of it
5302000	5304000	It's kind of a problem that's been facing the game
5304000	5306000	For a long time
5306000	5308000	There's a lot
5308000	5310000	There's the different areas
5310000	5312000	And then there's so many housing wards and plots
5312000	5314000	In every area
5314000	5316000	But it can be hard to get a house
5316000	5318000	Sometimes you have to just kind of camp out
5318000	5320000	And hope that a plot becomes available
5320000	5322000	And try to snatch that up as soon as you can
5322000	5324000	Because what happens in the way that plots become available
5324000	5326000	Is that if somebody doesn't log into their account
5326000	5328000	Or doesn't visit their house
5328000	5330000	I believe it's in 45 days
5330000	5332000	I think there's a timer that starts after 30 days
5332000	5334000	And if you go like another 15
5334000	5336000	Your house is basically demolished
5336000	5338000	And your plot goes up for sale
5338000	5340000	Because you basically abandon it
5340000	5342000	You get some of your investment back
5342000	5344000	And any furniture you put in there
5344000	5346000	You can go talk to an NPC and get it back
5346000	5348000	But you've essentially lost your claim to the land
5348000	5350000	So you get bounced for not having visited it
5350000	5352000	And so the housing is
5352000	5354000	And somebody will be there trying to buy it
5354000	5356000	When that happens
5356000	5358000	So I finally got my house
5358000	5360000	Because I went to a new server
5360000	5362000	And I finally bought my house
5362000	5364000	Because somebody abandoned the land
5364000	5366000	And I just happened to be in the right place
5366000	5368000	Right time and I got the house
5368000	5370000	Well, because not everybody is able to conduct their lives
5370000	5372000	With the same pattern that maybe they were before
5372000	5374000	Not everybody is necessarily logging into Final Fantasy 14
5374000	5376000	With the same, you know
5376000	5378000	And especially probably people
5378000	5380000	That are working on the front lines
5380000	5382000	In places like healthcare and so forth
5382000	5384000	Probably aren't thinking about things like Final Fantasy 14
5384000	5386000	That they used to
5386000	5388000	So, the automatic demolishing system has been suspended
5388000	5390000	So, and they've said
5390000	5392000	In a statement from Square Enix
5392000	5394000	Quote, taking into account the worldwide spread
5394000	5396000	Of COVID-19 and the economical effects
5396000	5398000	Of various cities going into lockdown
5398000	5400000	We've decided to temporarily
5400000	5402000	Suspend automatic housing demolition
5402000	5404000	Now that I'm saying this out loud
5404000	5406000	This could also very much be
5406000	5408000	For the sake of other countries
5408000	5410000	Maybe not so much the US
5410000	5412000	But other places where cafes
5412000	5414000	And that kind of pay in advance game time
5414000	5416000	Is like how you play it
5416000	5418000	We have to remember in the US culture
5418000	5420000	Playing at home and that stuff
5420000	5422000	Is very much how you do it
5422000	5424000	But there's other cultures where Final Fantasy 14 exists
5424000	5426000	Where you go to an internet cafe
5426000	5428000	To play and log into your character
5428000	5430000	And all that stuff
5430000	5432000	So I would bet for the sake of those places
5432000	5434000	That's why this is being
5434000	5436000	You know, and it's kind of one of those
5436000	5438000	It's easier to push the button for everybody
5438000	5440000	Than it is for just some places
5440000	5442000	So there you go
5442000	5444000	No more evictions in Final Fantasy 14
5444000	5446000	Until this is figured out
5446000	5448000	So hopefully something that reflects
5448000	5450000	The real world because I know there's a lot of people
5450000	5452000	And I'm thinking of a lot of friends of mine
5452000	5454000	Who have been displaced from work
5454000	5456000	I'm sure there's many of you out there listening
5456000	5458000	Because of what's going on in the real world
5458000	5462000	And I'm glad to hear
5462000	5464000	They're doing things like
5464000	5466000	Unemployment benefits
5466000	5468000	Like the stimulus package and so forth
5468000	5470000	I think we know
5470000	5472000	It's just the first of many things
5472000	5474000	That need to be done
5474000	5476000	So that we don't have just this complete
5476000	5478000	Catastrophe of people not being
5478000	5480000	Because where are all these people gonna go
5480000	5482000	So hopefully the government
5482000	5484000	Is able to
5484000	5486000	Put a stop to people
5486000	5488000	Unnecessarily getting kicked out of
5488000	5490000	Their places
5490000	5492000	So we'll see what develops
5492000	5494000	Over the next few weeks and months
5494000	5496000	Alright, well Loki we have a few more stories
5496000	5498000	Before we wrap up the show. Loki, you first
5498000	5500000	So
5500000	5502000	Capcom has decided to cancel
5502000	5504000	Their Capcom Pro Tour
5504000	5506000	At least the first half of it
5506000	5508000	Due to the COVID-19
5508000	5510000	Pandemic and they made their announcement
5510000	5512000	Via the Capcom Fighters
5512000	5514000	Twitter page basically saying that
5514000	5516000	Currently the Nobel coronavirus
5516000	5518000	COVID-19 is projected to continue
5518000	5520000	For several more months or longer
5520000	5522000	Across the world in light of this situation
5522000	5524000	Concerning the health and wellbeing of our players
5524000	5526000	Staff and visitors, all tournaments
5526000	5528000	Scheduled to be held in the first half of
5528000	5530000	2020 Capcom Pro Tour
5530000	5532000	Season have been removed
5532000	5534000	From the schedule. We apologize for any
5534000	5536000	Inconveniences may have caused players
5536000	5538000	Fans and tournament operators and production
5538000	5540000	Teams. The second half of the Capcom
5540000	5542000	Pro Tournament is scheduled to resume in
5542000	5544000	July, but we will continue to monitor
5544000	5546000	The novella coronavirus
5546000	5548000	Situation and we'll adjust
5548000	5550000	The schedule and rules accordingly
5550000	5552000	I mean it makes sense that it was gonna
5552000	5554000	happen. Yeah it's just kind of another
5554000	5556000	One of those up just add that to the list
5556000	5558000	Of things that are put on hold for a little bit but
5558000	5560000	It is the right thing to do so
5560000	5562000	We just you know I think now we're just all kind of
5562000	5564000	Wondering like when's where's that
5564000	5566000	Line gonna be of things that get
5566000	5568000	Canceled and things that don't get cancelled like when
5568000	5570000	You know the government is
5570000	5572000	Talking about April 30th maybe
5572000	5574000	We can start to relax some social
5574000	5576000	Maybe maybe
5576000	5578000	Does that mean we're gonna be able to have conventions
5578000	5580000	Again I don't know if it necessarily means
5580000	5582000	That we might start to see what probably
5582000	5584000	Will happen is that maybe they'll still like
5584000	5586000	Allow you to go to restaurants and things but they're
5586000	5588000	Still gonna say to limit gatherings to a certain
5588000	5590000	Amount of people like you know what I mean and then maybe
5590000	5592000	Like May or June we start to
5592000	5594000	See some of that come back as the line gets flattened
5594000	5596000	Even more hopefully so
5596000	5598000	Yeah I think it's gonna happen is they're gonna
5598000	5600000	Basically kind of scale it back
5600000	5602000	Kind of like how we saw it progressively
5602000	5604000	Get more restricted it's
5604000	5606000	Gonna kind of go the opposite direction
5606000	5608000	SSU 100 Matt points out
5608000	5610000	The Olympics was the big one that being shut
5610000	5612000	Down since a huge presidents yeah and that is not
5612000	5614000	An easy thing to move and you know and I think
5614000	5616000	I think I mentioned this last week when we heard about
5616000	5618000	This Olympics getting pushed back
5618000	5620000	Thing was kind of starting this puts that
5620000	5622000	Mario and Sonic at the 2020
5622000	5624000	Tokyo games that game that
5624000	5626000	Puts up in a very interesting predicament of
5626000	5628000	Being a licensed property
5628000	5630000	For something that didn't happen
5632000	5634000	That's not necessarily true
5634000	5636000	Because it will happen
5636000	5638000	But it's specifically
5638000	5640000	It's not called the Tokyo games
5640000	5642000	It's called the 2020 Olympic games
5642000	5644000	So yes yes it's fine
5644000	5646000	You all want to get me on a technicality
5646000	5648000	Well it will happen in 2021 yes I understand that
5648000	5650000	But the game is still the 2020
5650000	5652000	Another game they can make a second game
5652000	5654000	So what I was gonna say is
5654000	5656000	I mean it's not the most ridiculous
5656000	5658000	Property that's been created
5658000	5660000	Or no tie in
5660000	5662000	You may remember there was a Spy
5662000	5664000	Hunter game that's starring
5664000	5666000	Vin Diesel that came out
5666000	5668000	Or I think it was Vin Diesel
5668000	5670000	Somebody some action star that came out
5670000	5672000	And then the Spy Hunter movie never came out
5672000	5674000	Oh right
5674000	5676000	Yeah I remember they were working on a Spy Hunter movie
5676000	5678000	And then they just kind of stopped doing that
5678000	5680000	Now Bobby is saying that the branding is still all gonna be
5680000	5682000	Tokyo 2020
5682000	5684000	Well that is gonna be interesting alright then I guess maybe it doesn't make that game
5684000	5686000	As special as I thought but
5686000	5688000	If all the branding Oh yes thank you
5688000	5690000	It's The Rock I knew it was one of them
5690000	5692000	But The Rock was
5692000	5694000	One of those Fast and Furious
5694000	5696000	Guys one of them
5696000	5698000	One of them was in it
5698000	5700000	Well Vin Diesel had the other one too
5700000	5702000	There was another one though with Vin Diesel
5702000	5704000	It was
5704000	5706000	I don't remember what it was about
5706000	5708000	But it was another car driving
5708000	5710000	Type game not like
5710000	5712000	Fast and the Furious or something but there was another
5712000	5714000	Spy thing with cars
5714000	5716000	That he was in as well
5716000	5718000	Tiger Claw says The Wheelman
5718000	5720000	Yes that is thank you
5721000	5723000	That was also supposed to be a movie
5723000	5725000	Alright
5725000	5727000	Well moving on and after this story
5727000	5729000	We're gonna take your questions
5729000	5731000	And comments from our chat room
5731000	5733000	As we move into the listener round table
5733000	5735000	So if you have any questions or things you want us to bring up
5735000	5737000	That we haven't gotten to yet
5737000	5739000	Maybe we'll hit on in a last minute story
5739000	5741000	But twitch.tv slash vog network
5741000	5743000	Or vog network is the place to leave some comments
5743000	5745000	Meanwhile
5745000	5747000	We have news of a Nier
5747000	5749000	Remaster coming out
5749000	5751000	So Nier is hitting its 10 year anniversary
5751000	5753000	And there's going to be a
5753000	5755000	Remaster Nier Replicant
5755000	5757000	That's coming out for the PC, Playstation 4
5757000	5759000	And Xbox One
5759000	5761000	Now originally Nier Replicant
5761000	5763000	Was on Japan on the Playstation 3
5763000	5765000	But in the West it was called
5765000	5767000	Nier Gestalt
5767000	5769000	Which then came to Japan on the Xbox 360
5769000	5771000	There were different
5771000	5773000	Protagonists in the games
5773000	5775000	But if you have a game and I know I have this game
5775000	5777000	On the Xbox 360 that's just called
5777000	5779000	Nier, it's that, but with a different
5779000	5781000	Protagonist
5781000	5783000	So essentially it's a remake of that older Nier game
5783000	5785000	That was that, it's just some
5785000	5787000	Little changes there
5787000	5789000	But I know a lot of people are pretty excited about that
5789000	5791000	So it's coming out for Playstation 4, Xbox One
5791000	5793000	And Steam
5793000	5795000	Just in time for the 10 year anniversary
5795000	5797000	I'm a little surprised they're doing this
5797000	5799000	And not an all new Nier game
5799000	5801000	But maybe
5801000	5803000	It's one of those things where a new Nier game
5803000	5805000	Is going to take a little time
5805000	5807000	Again, this is coming out on Playstation 4 and Xbox One
5807000	5809000	Maybe a new Nier game is something
5809000	5811000	They're plotting for Playstation 5
5811000	5813000	And Xbox Series X
5813000	5815000	And so it's going to take them a little more time to cook that up
5815000	5817000	So, understandable
5817000	5819000	Fifth Dream Today says
5819000	5821000	Best Music
5821000	5823000	Yeah, the
5823000	5825000	Raid in Final Fantasy that's based off Nier
5825000	5827000	Has some pretty amazing music in it
5827000	5829000	I gotta say, it's really cool
5829000	5831000	Act Deft also points out
5831000	5833000	Nier Automata is coming to Xbox Game Pass
5833000	5835000	On April 2nd
5835000	5837000	Yay, I'll finally get around to playing it
5837000	5839000	After all this time
5839000	5841000	So, I will make it a point to check that out
5841000	5843000	I've heard nothing but great things about the Nier games
5843000	5845000	So I need to check that out for sure
5845000	5847000	So, alright
5847000	5849000	Well, we're going to open up the listener round table
5849000	5851000	If you guys have any comments or questions
5851000	5853000	Or so forth
5853000	5855000	Act Deft in our chat says
5855000	5857000	Rob, the Mario and Sonic game is still special
5857000	5859000	Because it has Waluigi doing gymnastics
5859000	5861000	That is true
5861000	5863000	Waluigi participating in those events
5863000	5865000	Is always going to be a special thing
5865000	5867000	Shehulk10 with a question for us
5867000	5869000	Do you guys have any
5869000	5871000	Old games that you liked
5871000	5873000	But not really that popular
5873000	5875000	That you would like to be given
5875000	5877000	A current gen remake
5877000	5879000	Or makeover
5879000	5881000	Mine is Jaws the Revenge from 2006
5881000	5883000	Where you play as the
5883000	5885000	Shark
5885000	5887000	Oh my god, I forgot about that one
5887000	5889000	Do you remember that game? The Jaws but you're the shark
5889000	5891000	I thought they had one that was just like that
5891000	5893000	Not too long ago
5893000	5895000	It's another Jaws game
5895000	5897000	I think it's Jaws
5897000	5899000	Man Eater
5899000	5901000	Yes, it looks
5901000	5903000	There's a lot similar there
5903000	5905000	It's not out yet
5905000	5907000	But that is something that's coming
5907000	5909000	So that's a good one
5909000	5911000	One that we bring up a lot on this program
5911000	5913000	Is the Guardian Legend
5913000	5915000	Which is honestly one of the greatest
5915000	5917000	8-bit games on the Nintendo
5917000	5919000	It was kind of a hybrid of a shooter and Legend of Zelda
5919000	5921000	And if you've never played the game
5921000	5923000	I really urge you to go check out some YouTubes
5923000	5925000	Unfortunately I think it's one of those
5925000	5927000	Who owns the rights now
5927000	5929000	That we probably are not going to see this game
5929000	5931000	On Virtual Console or anything like that anytime soon
5931000	5933000	Although I would be so giddy if we ever did
5933000	5935000	But I would love to see
5935000	5937000	That come back
5937000	5939000	But it has to be the right studio
5939000	5941000	That does it
5941000	5943000	And I would really want to see a company like WayForward
5943000	5945000	Because weren't they the ones behind the Blaster Master Zero?
5945000	5947000	Yes
5947000	5949000	Because that was done right
5949000	5951000	That Blaster Master relaunched it
5951000	5953000	And they even had the sequel as well
5953000	5955000	Which was kind of like a sequel that didn't really exist
5955000	5957000	Which is kind of awesome
5957000	5959000	That I would want to see come back
5959000	5961000	But it needs to be like
5961000	5963000	As good as Blaster Master Zero was
5963000	5965000	I would be very sad
5965000	5967000	If it was kind of crap
5967000	5969000	Like they kind of
5969000	5971000	Like that other Blaster Master game
5971000	5973000	That was on the Wii
5973000	5975000	Which was not that great because they tried to like redo too much
5975000	5977000	And then the physics felt off
5977000	5979000	And it kind of ruined the game
5979000	5981000	BobbyBlackWolfe points out WayForward
5981000	5983000	Also did DuckTales Remastered
5983000	5985000	Which was also very well done
5985000	5987000	Very good point
5987000	5989000	Some other folks in chat are answering this question
5989000	5991000	BobbyBlackWolfe says
5991000	5993000	GuttaruMan
5993000	5995000	Very good answer
5995000	5997000	ActDeft an old game I would love to see get a remake or make over
5997000	5999000	Uniracers
5999000	6001000	Repcycled in chat says
6001000	6003000	StuntRaceFX
6003000	6005000	Which I'm sure is going to lead to the inevitable
6005000	6007000	Loki answer of ExciteBike
6007000	6009000	ExciteTruck
6009000	6011000	ExciteTruck get it right
6011000	6013000	Sorry my bad
6013000	6015000	We've seen ExciteBike get remastered a few times
6015000	6017000	But not ExciteTruck yet
6017000	6019000	Yes I'm all for that
6019000	6021000	I'm all for an ExciteTruck
6021000	6023000	Yeah
6023000	6025000	Repcycled saying StuntRaceFX
6025000	6027000	In a way I feel like ExciteTruck
6027000	6029000	Was a StuntRaceFX
6029000	6031000	A little bit
6031000	6033000	A little bit I don't know
6033000	6035000	So those are some answers there
6035000	6037000	Loki any last minute stories
6037000	6039000	While we wait and see if chat has any other questions
6039000	6041000	Or comments for us
6041000	6043000	Yes I do have one so
6043000	6045000	Apparently there was a push notification
6045000	6047000	That went out
6047000	6049000	Just tonight saying that
6049000	6051000	HQ Trivia is back
6051000	6053000	Apparently
6053000	6055000	I think that was the trivia game that you can actually
6055000	6057000	Win real money
6057000	6059000	That thing was like all the rage
6059000	6061000	For like a month and then everybody quit
6061000	6063000	Yeah and if you saw their last episode
6063000	6065000	It was great go look it up on YouTube
6065000	6067000	Because they were drunk and they didn't
6067000	6069000	Give a fuck
6069000	6071000	They were swearing and doing all this stuff
6071000	6073000	They were probably high
6073000	6075000	They were just like we're closing tonight
6075000	6077000	Whatever it's the last one
6077000	6079000	And the guy put up a prize of $5
6079000	6081000	Of his own money
6081000	6083000	It was great
6083000	6085000	It was like total
6085000	6087000	They're coming back tonight
6087000	6089000	So
6089000	6091000	Alright cool I guess
6091000	6093000	You know maybe it's one of those things
6093000	6095000	Where it's like now is the time for that
6095000	6097000	Maybe they see an opportunity where it's like
6097000	6099000	Everybody's stuck at home
6099000	6101000	Let's try this again
6101000	6103000	They must have had a financier step in
6103000	6105000	And be like now's the time
6105000	6107000	An anonymous investor
6107000	6109000	That's what it is
6109000	6111000	ActDeft in chat
6111000	6113000	Says question for Robin Loki
6113000	6115000	Have you seen that Twitter tag meme
6115000	6117000	To post four games that defined you
6117000	6119000	Well what are yours
6119000	6121000	I have seen that meme
6121000	6123000	I just held off on doing it
6123000	6125000	Because I don't like tag memes
6125000	6127000	Because then it's like I have to tag people
6127000	6129000	That probably won't do it and then it's like
6129000	6131000	Why don't you tag me
6131000	6133000	That's basically an email for no thanks
6133000	6135000	There's a lot about those memes I don't really like
6135000	6137000	But let's take the
6137000	6139000	Because the question is still good
6139000	6141000	So let's take the question out of that
6141000	6143000	Four games that define you
6145000	6147000	This is tricky
6147000	6149000	I'd have to really think on this
6149000	6151000	But in the moment I'm gonna say
6151000	6153000	One of the obvious answers is Dance Dance Revolution
6153000	6155000	Without that game I wouldn't know Loki
6155000	6157000	I wouldn't know any of you
6157000	6159000	Because I wouldn't have had this show
6159000	6161000	So that's at the top of the list
6161000	6163000	Other games
6163000	6165000	So I'm gonna try to let that be the music game representation
6165000	6167000	I would say the original Legend of Zelda
6167000	6169000	On the NES
6169000	6171000	Just because that was the game
6171000	6173000	That really turned me into a video game nerd
6173000	6175000	Because that was the one where other kids
6175000	6177000	Who used to bully me would then
6177000	6179000	Secretly want to ask me questions about
6179000	6181000	So how do I get to the fourth dungeon in the second quest
6181000	6183000	Yeah right stuff like that
6183000	6185000	So I would say that game was very definitive
6191000	6193000	Two more
6193000	6195000	Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo
6195000	6197000	Because of the
6197000	6199000	Because of the
6199000	6201000	Fucking crazy amount of that I played in college
6203000	6205000	I think that's really all I need to say about that one
6205000	6207000	And that was kind of like the PlayStation
6207000	6209000	I almost said Final Fantasy 7
6209000	6211000	But then I was like no you know what PlayStation game got even more time
6211000	6213000	Was Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo
6215000	6217000	And then a fourth game
6217000	6219000	Probably some sort of MMO
6219000	6221000	Maybe I will say
6221000	6223000	Final Fantasy 11
6223000	6225000	Again I'm not really giving this a lot of thought
6225000	6227000	I'm kind of answering this spontaneously
6227000	6229000	But those are the four that come up spontaneously
6229000	6231000	But I feel like an MMO needs representation in there
6231000	6233000	I had an MMO based podcast for many years
6233000	6235000	And that way the Final Fantasy franchise gets represented as well
6235000	6237000	Which I've always been a big fan of
6237000	6239000	Alright Loki what about you
6239000	6241000	Four games that define you
6241000	6243000	So I have to say
6243000	6245000	Final Fantasy 7
6245000	6247000	Final Fantasy 7
6247000	6249000	So I have to say
6249000	6251000	Dance Man's Revolution
6251000	6253000	I mean probably the whole series
6253000	6255000	Because they can't really
6255000	6257000	I guess fourth mix if we had to pick
6257000	6259000	A game
6259000	6261000	Third mix plus Korean
6261000	6263000	Is mine
6263000	6265000	Okay
6265000	6267000	And then I would say
6267000	6269000	Grand Theft Auto 4
6269000	6271000	Because I played a ton of that
6271000	6273000	Let's see
6277000	6279000	I would probably have to say
6279000	6281000	Final Fantasy 11
6281000	6283000	And
6285000	6287000	Yeah probably The Legend of Zelda
6287000	6289000	Because that was one of the first Nintendo games I got
6289000	6291000	Driver 3
6291000	6293000	I didn't play enough Driver 3
6293000	6295000	Saints Row
6295000	6297000	Okay yeah I did play a ton of Saints Row
6297000	6299000	She-Hulk 10
6299000	6301000	I like this answer
6301000	6303000	Pac-Man Asteroids
6303000	6305000	Halo Mass Effect
6305000	6307000	I'm really surprised I didn't put
6307000	6309000	Mass Effect the trilogy on my list
6309000	6311000	See that's a my bad for not thinking
6311000	6313000	That through further but
6313000	6315000	You know I think I don't know if I would say
6315000	6317000	Mass Effect defined me
6317000	6319000	As much as
6319000	6321000	I really fucking liked
6321000	6323000	Mass Effect
6323000	6325000	Because I kind of feel like there's a difference
6325000	6327000	You know what I mean
6327000	6329000	I'm not critical of how anybody else
6329000	6331000	Wants to answer this question I'm just saying when I answered it
6331000	6333000	Things that I'm thinking of are like
6333000	6335000	Like this podcast
6335000	6337000	And the many many many hours
6337000	6339000	Would not exist if not for DDR and so on
6339000	6341000	Kind of the different reasons I gave
6341000	6343000	But like as far as like
6343000	6345000	Things I really enjoyed I would really have to
6345000	6347000	Probably put Mass Effect on that list
6347000	6349000	As well so
6349000	6351000	Really good question I like that I guess that's a good one
6351000	6353000	To end on so any other last minute stories
6353000	6355000	Loki before we wrap up
6355000	6357000	Yeah so
6357000	6359000	Couple more
6359000	6361000	I talked about GameStop closing 300
6361000	6363000	Stores so it's actually about 320
6363000	6365000	Stores in 2020
6365000	6367000	This was due to their 2019
6367000	6369000	Investors call
6369000	6371000	Apparently they're saying we're continuing to
6371000	6373000	Focus optimizing our global
6373000	6375000	Store fleet in fiscal 2019
6375000	6377000	And closing that total
6377000	6379000	Of 321
6379000	6381000	Stores inclusive of
6381000	6383000	333 closings and 12
6383000	6385000	Openings and in fiscal
6385000	6387000	2020 we will continue our efforts
6387000	6389000	To de-densify the store
6389000	6391000	Base and focus on
6391000	6393000	Maximizing product
6393000	6395000	Productivity of the entire fleet
6395000	6397000	So
6397000	6399000	I mean this was as of a call
6399000	6401000	Last week
6401000	6403000	So who knows the toll that
6403000	6405000	Other real world stuff might take on this
6405000	6407000	But they were already planning to close 300
6407000	6409000	They were already doing that like I already
6409000	6411000	Like I said my local store is
6411000	6413000	Closing I know that he
6413000	6415000	The guys there were
6415000	6417000	Promising me some stuff but I know
6417000	6419000	That they haven't been in the store for
6419000	6421000	You know a week or so
6421000	6423000	So I don't even know what that's doing
6423000	6425000	To their closing because they were
6425000	6427000	Doing like closeout stuff but they still have a ton
6427000	6429000	Of product in the store and
6429000	6431000	I mean if they're not open I don't know what that does
6431000	6433000	For them if they're just going to postpone the closure
6433000	6435000	Of them until they can open again
6435000	6437000	Or what the case may be
6437000	6439000	I was thinking
6439000	6441000	Going back on that four games question and I can't
6441000	6443000	Believe I didn't fucking say Ingress
6443000	6445000	Just because of like
6445000	6447000	I've traveled to cities I wouldn't have gone to
6447000	6449000	Otherwise if it wasn't for that game
6449000	6451000	Yeah so there's
6451000	6453000	I have to really sit down and think about that one
6453000	6455000	Long and hard there's a lot of good answers
6455000	6457000	For that I think so
6457000	6459000	Anyway
6459000	6461000	Because somebody else said Pokemon
6461000	6463000	It made me think Pokemon Go and then I was like oh yeah
6463000	6465000	Ingress I should have said Ingress because I've been playing that way too long
6465000	6467000	Maybe Ingress
6467000	6469000	Just slipped my mind because I haven't been playing
6469000	6471000	It the past couple weeks I wonder what
6471000	6473000	I mean a little
6473000	6475000	Bit like when I walked
6475000	6477000	30 minutes to another
6477000	6479000	Park I played it at the park
6479000	6481000	And then walked back but that's like it
6481000	6483000	Like I'm not playing it nearly
6483000	6485000	At the level I was playing it before
6485000	6487000	So interesting
6487000	6489000	Yeah SG100Matt says Rob didn't say
6489000	6491000	Super Metroid either
6491000	6493000	No I didn't because again
6493000	6495000	The question was the games that defined you
6495000	6497000	Not which games do you really really really really like
6497000	6499000	I think there's a difference
6499000	6501000	You know it really is
6501000	6503000	Anyway
6503000	6505000	So that's it for last minute stories Logie
6507000	6509000	I was going to say there's one more
6509000	6511000	It's kind of silly
6511000	6513000	So Crash Nitro
6513000	6515000	Field Racing
6515000	6517000	Or Crash Team Racing Nitro Field
6517000	6519000	They had a funny
6519000	6521000	April Fools
6521000	6523000	Day
6523000	6525000	DLC that they're putting out
6525000	6527000	So apparently it's free
6527000	6529000	Which is good and so what happens
6529000	6531000	Is if you smash some of these
6531000	6533000	Benox crates scattered throughout the tracks
6533000	6535000	You can actually
6535000	6537000	Unlock a hidden crate
6537000	6539000	Cart
6539000	6541000	So the hidden
6541000	6543000	It's like a
6543000	6545000	A benox crate
6545000	6547000	Is the driver of the cart
6547000	6549000	One of the smashing crates
6549000	6551000	From Crash Team
6551000	6553000	Huh interesting
6553000	6555000	That's a little silly
6555000	6557000	I kind of like though that they
6557000	6559000	Are doing an April Fools
6559000	6561000	Something along those lines because I think a lot of us
6561000	6563000	Are going to be really tired of April Fools
6563000	6565000	Day this year for all intents and purposes
6565000	6567000	April Fools Day is cancelled
6567000	6569000	Just don't
6569000	6571000	April Fools Day? Don't
6571000	6573000	Not this year, not today Satan
6573000	6575000	There's too much other stuff going on in the room
6575000	6577000	But I think cute things
6577000	6579000	Like this
6579000	6581000	Ready for it
6581000	6583000	Extra things, sideshow, okay
6583000	6585000	Okay we can do that
6585000	6587000	But that's about all we can tolerate right now
6587000	6589000	No jokes
6589000	6591000	Anyhow
6591000	6593000	Alright I think with that we will go ahead and wrap things up
6593000	6595000	I know it's a little bit shorter of a show
6595000	6597000	But we didn't have Jamie tonight
6597000	6599000	We're on Discord so I think things will be a little bit
6599000	6601000	Shorter just in the interim
6601000	6603000	We still filled a good about two hours or so
6603000	6605000	Nonetheless
6605000	6607000	Almost two hours
6607000	6609000	We want to thank you guys for being here and tuning in this week
6609000	6611000	Whether it was live on Sunday night
6611000	6613000	Over the Voice Geeks Network Twitch channel
6613000	6615000	Or if it was on the podcast feed
6615000	6617000	Really appreciate that
6617000	6619000	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Songs Radio
6619000	6621000	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice
6621000	6623000	But the more voices we get here on Sunday nights
6623000	6625000	And on our podcast feed
6625000	6627000	Throughout the week sending us tweets and things like that
6627000	6629000	The more we can get your voices out there
6629000	6631000	So tell a friend or two about the show
6631000	6633000	Help us spread the word
6633000	6635000	Auto hosts on your Twitch channel go a long way
6635000	6637000	Please consider adding VOG Network to your host list
6637000	6639000	That would be super awesome
6639000	6641000	And then just you know sharing on social media
6641000	6643000	The Spotify link or things like that whatever
6643000	6645000	Those things come in very very very very handy
6645000	6647000	Really appreciate those of you guys that do that
6647000	6649000	That's going to do it for this week
6649000	6651000	We'll be back in seven days to talk all again
6651000	6653000	And hopefully Dar Sacro will be back with us
6653000	6655000	And can talk about other stuff
6655000	6657000	We'll probably still be remote via Discord
6657000	6659000	For a little while but that's okay
6659000	6661000	We'll talk about whatever's going on in gaming
6661000	6663000	Loki I guess we get to final thoughts
6663000	6665000	Any final thoughts from you tonight?
6665000	6667000	Yes I've been staring at a black widow
6667000	6669000	That's been in my
6669000	6671000	My
6671000	6673000	monitor arms
6673000	6675000	And it's just
6675000	6677000	It's crawled up inside there now
6677000	6679000	And now I have to somehow take this apart
6679000	6681000	And go kill it
6681000	6683000	I think you're going to be burning your house down later
6683000	6685000	Honestly and I
6685000	6687000	That's the reason to do it
6687000	6689000	So
6689000	6691000	And then my final thoughts
6691000	6693000	Tonight is
6693000	6695000	Just keep staying inside
6695000	6697000	If I can do it you can do it
6697000	6699000	And enjoy the games
6699000	6701000	Catch up on your backlog
6701000	6703000	You'll have some near on Xbox Game Pass this week
6703000	6705000	You've got plenty of other free games out there
6705000	6707000	And stuff in your backlog
6707000	6709000	So check it all out this week
6709000	6711000	Have fun and we'll see you
6711000	6713000	On Twitch and on the podcast feed
6713000	6715000	In seven more days
6715000	6717000	Have a great week everybody
