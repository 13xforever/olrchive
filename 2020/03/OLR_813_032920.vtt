WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
Nearly three decades later the game with no conversation dialogue

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
The original quarter eater Dragon Slayer is going from movie video game to video game movie

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
I'm hoping for a space age successor

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
This is just one story, join us for the rest starting right now on the show where every gamer has some space

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 813 of our program for March the 29th of 2020

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
My name is Rob Roberts and as we talked a little bit about last week

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
And as I'm sure you're well aware with everything going on in the world

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
I am all alone in the studio this week as we are practicing social distancing

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
Which is a pretty good idea in the state of the world today

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Pretty good thing to be practicing

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
Not joining us at all tonight though sadly DarkSakura or Jamie Summers

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
Talked to her yesterday a little bit via text because her voice is not holding out so well

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
She was having kind of a rough night last night so she decided to bow out of tonight's show

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Just to let her voice recover a little bit

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Completely understand if you've been listening to the last couple weeks

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
She's been battling something kind of nasty

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
We don't know what it is because is it the big one? Don't know because testing is not there for it

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
But regardless we're wishing her well

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
I did check in with her about an hour ago

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
She said she was doing a lot better today but still wanted to rest her voice for the night

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Which is certainly understandable

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
Who knows she might pop in to our chat room at some point throughout the night

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network

01:45.000 --> 01:51.000
vog network dot com that's vog network dot com or on twitch twitch dot tv slash vog network is where we tape

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
Every Sunday night at 6 o'clock pacific 9 o'clock eastern ish right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
Even though DarkSakura is not here tonight I am joined via discord by tech master Loki

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Hello Loki

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Hello I'm here

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
You are here how are you how are you holding up after how many days is it that you've been in the house now

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
For me it's coming up on 14 days tomorrow

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
Um yeah because I was working from home as a week from last Monday so yeah it's been two weeks

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Yeah so yeah pretty much the same so well glad you're hanging in there

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
Hopefully a chance to play some games and maybe get caught up on writing your own game

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
Um I would have let no I've had time no time to do either of those

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
And the reason for that is I've been dealing with PC issues

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
And so I my laptop does not want to cooperate with two monitors I have

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
And so it's it keeps crashing I've been just dealing with that all week

02:50.000 --> 02:57.000
And so because it clearly is not working and I think the graphics card may be going out on it

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
It works fine by itself so I got a replacement coming

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
All right well glad you at least have a replacement coming hope it makes a decent amount of time

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
Because I know they're prioritizing the essential stuff right now so it's

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Oh no it'll be here like tomorrow

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
Well that's good that's good I'm looking at some of the chat room comments over at twitch.tv slash vog network

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
Where fifth dream today is saying the mouse is looking at me plushplosion

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
Okay so those that are watching live on twitch have the visual

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
And I haven't plugged this in a while so I should say if you are a subscriber on twitch at vog network

03:34.000 --> 03:41.000
Which you can use your if you're an amazon prime person you get you may not know this but you get one free twitch subscription every month

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
So if you want to use that on vog network you get access to our video archives

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
The podcast audio version is free just as it has been for over 18 years

03:50.000 --> 03:56.000
Or not quite over 18 years over 17 years coming up on 18 years like I'm getting at that point where I forgot my own age

03:56.000 --> 04:03.000
But anyway the point is is if you're watching the visual whether it be live or via your twitch subscription for vog network

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
You can actually see see usually it would be myself and it would be loki on camera

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
DarkSakura sometimes on camera when she feels like it because you know it's her choice if she wants to get on camera or not

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
But without loki here I'm a little lonely so some of the various plushies that I have

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
That actually Alan freaking won some of these on that crane site

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
Torreba I think is the name of it I don't know what it is it's one of those freaking crane game sites

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
I shouldn't even give it a plug because he wasted so much time on that site and they're not paying me any money

04:31.000 --> 04:37.000
But he did win this little hamster thing in that master ball looking thing but captain pikachu and I go way back

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
I've had this life-sized pikachu for a long time so I have to have something to fill in for loki when he's not here

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
Maybe next week I'll get some round table breadsticks those will remind me of loki

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Maybe we'll see

04:50.000 --> 04:58.000
It might be a few weeks that we're on this system of doing OLR

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
I think it's important that we continue to do OLR to the best of our ability

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
But the reality is we're not exactly going to defy the governor's order

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
So once that is lifted and changed then we'll consider getting back together again

05:13.000 --> 05:20.000
Which if what we just heard earlier today in the national news is any guideline it's going to be at least till the end of April

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
But you know gotta keep people healthy gotta make sure we squash this thing flatten the curve

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
Try not to spread it around to people that don't need to have it myself included

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
So yeah we're just doing what we have to do

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
That didn't stop my neighbors from having their motorcycle party earlier today

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
What is up with that? We've been having neighbors that have been having parties too and I'm like you guys are missing the point

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
You're just gonna you're ruining it for everybody. It's horrible

05:49.000 --> 05:57.000
Maybe they watched Tiger King and decided to bring their well I wouldn't even say it's their inner redneck because it's kind of their whole persona

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
But you know amp that up a bit

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Have you been getting obsessed with Tiger King?

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
That is all everybody is fucking talking about on Twitch

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
It's Animal Crossing and Tiger King

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
I'm surprised the two haven't come together yet

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
I have watched the whole thing though

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Of course you have

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
It seems like the type of thing your wife would be into

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
And she was, yes

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Of course she was

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
No I've held off on Tiger King thus far

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
I am finally trying to finish Love is Blind

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
So I'm a few like and that was the big thing everybody was watching in February on Netflix

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
So I'm a little bit behind

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
So what is that? Is that because I sort of remember a show that was on the soup or something

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
Where they have like people in like a dark room talking to each other and they weren't able to see each other

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Is that that show?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Yeah but the soup has been off TV for years

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Love is Blind is a newer show

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
But they can only, they're in these like pod things and they can only talk to each other and they can't see each other

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
And then, but it's weird because like the first three episodes are that

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
And then the rest of it is, haha now let's see if it works

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Or if they become a hot mess and surprise

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Some of them are total hot messes when they get together in person

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
I mean I'm sure we're all shocked at the type of people that go on those sort of dating reality shows

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
That you put some, you mix them up in a room and there's drama, surprise right?

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Yeah

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Alright anyway, let's get into actual video game chat

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
I mean we could sit here and talk Netflix

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
I mean I guess we could talk about like Castlevania, Ingress anime

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
Or there's that other Netflix thing I bet is on y'all's mind

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Yes it's in the news, we'll get to that a little later

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
But first while we get to tonight's kickoff topic

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Loki, what are we starting off with tonight?

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
So they have the Nintendo Direct, or surprise Nintendo Direct I guess

07:33.000 --> 07:41.000
That was earlier this week talking about some indie games and some other like additions to current Nintendo games

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
So for example they talked about their progress in Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
They announced that some 2K games are going to be coming to the Switch

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
Including the Biostock Collection and Borderlands

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Those are going to be coming

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
I think that's, oh wait just real quick

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
I think that's great about Borderlands and Bioshock

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
But I don't know, this seems to be like the Switch's MO or something

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
How old are these games at this point?

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
And it's just now getting to Nintendo's console

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
It's not a read, it's not a dis, I understand

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
There's some people out there that are going to be very excited with the portability of a game like Bioshock

08:22.000 --> 08:28.000
But I don't know, I feel like those are games that are better experienced on a big TV

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Which yes I know the Switch can do, but you know the high end graphics and all that stuff

08:31.000 --> 08:38.000
I don't know, I feel like those are little scraps that the Nintendo fans are getting tossed

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
Don't get me wrong, I love my Switch, I'm super jazzed about other stuff that was in there

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
Maybe it's just one of those not for me dot com type of things

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
It's probably just pretty easy to port that stuff over I guess

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
I guess, maybe, just maybe the engine they're built in or whatever

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
It doesn't take a lot of man hours to port that over to Switch

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
I don't know, I just always feel like those are kind of scraps

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
And then they have the XCOM 2 collection as well

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
So that was something that was announced there

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
Burnout Paradise Remastered was another game that's supposed to be coming to the Switch as well

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
And then some of the other things they talked about

09:16.000 --> 09:23.000
There's the final piece of DLC for Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3, so it's a fantastic 4

09:24.000 --> 09:29.000
They talked a little bit about Animal Crossing New Horizons

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
That's going to have their seasonal event Bunny Day

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
Which that bunny is super creepy

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
But that's going to be taking place

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
Too bad it wasn't the bunny from Silent Hill

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
It pretty much is

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Can you do the reskins maybe?

09:45.000 --> 09:51.000
Can you design the bunny an outfit and make the bunny wear Silent Hill costumes?

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
I don't know, but Zipper is looking pretty creepy

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
I mean, think about how fucking crazy business Animal Crossing is doing right now

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
Animal Crossing is probably bigger than it's ever been

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
And it's because in large part of what's going on in the world

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
We don't have our real lives to talk about

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
So what are we talking about on social media?

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Our fake ones in Animal Crossing

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
I think this game would have done fine as it is in a normal world

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
But now especially that we're all shut in

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
And we can't go out and fish for real

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Or go out and do things out in nature for real

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
We're all sharing it through Animal Crossing

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
I don't know about y'all's social media

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
But my social media is filled with Animal Crossing stuff

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
And I just feel like

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
And the reason why I say all that is that this game and this franchise has never been hotter

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
In my opinion, with what's going on in pop culture and stuff

10:41.000 --> 10:47.000
This just seems like the time for Nintendo to really let us tweak it even more

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
Let us design some of our villagers

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
I would love to have villagers that imitate Pyramid Head and stuff

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
But maybe that is exactly what Nintendo does not want to open the flood gate to

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
If you could draw your own patterns for the villagers

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
I guess you could always give them shirts and things

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
But I feel like if you could totally reskin the villagers

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Somebody's gonna do Nudzu

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Somebody's gonna do Nudyzu

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
And it's gonna get awkward

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
I saw someone

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Then you're gonna have Tiger King

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Then you're gonna fucking have Tiger King

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
Well I saw somebody though actually on Twitter

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
And I want to say it might have been Mayor Marvel

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
But I thought it was

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
They did a dress that had a butt on the back of it

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Oh yes, oh my god I saw that

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Somebody had a dress pattern

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
But they drew a butt on it

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
So it just looked like the person's butt was hanging out of the back of the dress

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
That was great, I love it

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
Yes, it already happened

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Oh you creative people

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
Oh and through the QR code and generate your own pattern sites

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Anyway, people are putting all sorts of filthy things

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
But funny things too

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
Like I found online a shocked Pikachu painting that I have now

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I have an N7 logo up

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
What else do I have?

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I have

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
Oh a friend of mine sent me Rocky Horror Picture Show related ones

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
So now I have a throne scene with Frank N. Furter and friends all up there

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Okay

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
Yeah so it's just all this crazy stuff you can get with QR codes

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
So aside from the Bunny D event which of course they're gonna be hiding eggs

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
And they have special crafting things

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
There are some other games that they are talking about

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
One called Good Job

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
It looked pretty cool

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
And then some new

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
They're gonna have a demo for Bravely Default 2

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
As well as they're saying that Star Wars Jedi Knight Jedi Academy

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
And the Panzer Dragoon remake

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Those are all announced as well

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
And then the Bravely

12:51.000 --> 12:58.000
No I was gonna say the Bravely Default 2 demo came out with the day of the Nintendo Direct

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
So I didn't get around to playing it but some friends of mine played it

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
I'm hearing kind of mixed reviews on it

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Some people are really into it

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
You know those that probably really enjoyed the first Bravely Default

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
I'm hearing a lot of criticism about some of the character design

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
And some of the voice acting

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
I guess there's one character in particular

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
That's like please stop

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Please stop this now

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
So don't know we'll see how it goes

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
Okay so and then we also had Clubhouse Games

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
51 Worldwide Classics

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
That's been announced

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
That's coming on the Switch on June 5th

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
I wanna just say I wanted that freaking franchise to make a comeback

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Yeah

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Well I was so

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
And then oddly enough

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
Games that no one ever asked to be ported to the Switch

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Star Wars Episode 1 Racer

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
It's coming to the Switch

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Why?

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Because the pod racing was the only thing cool about that

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
I don't know maybe it's another one of those like

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
It was fairly simple to port so we did it

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
I guess porting games is the new shovelware

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Perhaps

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Anyways and then of course

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
New Fighter announced for the Smash Ultimate DLC

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
And that new fighter is Arms

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
Now I don't know if that's all of the different characters in Arms or just

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
One of the characters

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
You're kind of half right

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
They just announced that the next character

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Would be from Arms

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
But they didn't say who it would be

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
And I know a lot of people are hoping for Twintelle

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
Just because she was a kind of standout character from Arms

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
But the thing about Twintelle

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
And the reason why I don't think it's going to be her

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Is that Twintelle actually uses her hair

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Not her arms

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Like she's the one with the big braids

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
So I don't know if she'll end up being the character or not

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
I don't really play Arms

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
I've tried to play it a little bit

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
And I'm going to be honest

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
I didn't care for it

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
So I kind of wonder why Nintendo is trying to make Arms happen now

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Because they did that

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
They're doing the free play weekend or whatever

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Okay

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
But I guess other people were into it

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Sure, but I wasn't a big Arms fan

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
So I'm kind of meh on this news

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Yeah, I remember they were trying to position

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
As like an eSports title

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Almost

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
That was kind of the trend there

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Where everyone wanted to be an eSports title

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
And it just wasn't going to happen

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Yeah

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
No, it didn't happen

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Maybe eSports has

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Got a new focus on it now

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Because of this whole stay at home stuff

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
And how it's affecting

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Some of the programming on television and stuff

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
But that seems a little too

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Like I don't think Nintendo

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Is putting Arms in Smash

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Because suddenly due to Coronavirus

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
They sense a rise in eSports

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
That is too calculated

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
And would have taken more time to plan

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Than the reality of this situation

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
No, I don't think that's at all

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
I'm just saying

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
I don't think eSports even around Arms is ever going to happen

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
But

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I was going to say the last bit of news

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
In addition to

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Ring Fit Adventure

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
They're getting an update which adds a new rhythm game mode

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
They have songs from Super Mario Odyssey

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Splatoon 2 and Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Which is pretty cool

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Man, if only we could get some pop songs in there too

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Like that would be great

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I have not played that mode yet

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
I've seen some tweets from people who've been playing it

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
And I've watched some of the YouTubes and stuff

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
So it kind of looks like

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Just instead of the notes falling

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
From the top down

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
They kind of come in more of a

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Well shaped thing

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Like Guitar Hero

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Because I guess we learned all those years ago

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
That Konami actually has the patent

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
On the notes falling from the top

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Of the screen down

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
So that's why all the music games now do it

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Where it's coming at you

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Because Konami doesn't have the patent on that

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
That patent has run out already

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I don't know

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
But for whatever reason

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Nintendo is doing it where it's coming out at you

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
And you can see the motions with the controller

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
With the ring controller

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Like it might squeeze on a certain bit

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Or you might kind of tilt it left or right

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
At a certain point

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
And that is all dictated by when the notes

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Get to the front

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
It looked interesting

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
I want to try it

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
It probably shows

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
I haven't really played Ring Fit

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Since quarantine started

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
But I have been snacking

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
I probably should be playing Ring Fit

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Some folks in chat talking about

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Arms

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
AJ Twist is asking

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Isn't there an Arms character that is a trophy in Smash already

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I do believe you are correct

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
And they're talking about Spring Man

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Act F says I totally forgot the name is the armed guy

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
AJ Twist says Spring Man

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Yeah I think they're kind of like

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Mascot guy that's like on the box

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
I believe he is some type of assist

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Trophy already in Smash

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Not that

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Assist trophies and the like

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
It has stopped characters from becoming

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Full blown characters before

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
I feel like

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
There was something that got upgraded

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Along the way but

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
It escapes me in the moment

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Man what are we getting Geno? Seriously

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Well you've got four

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Four more

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Characters after this one

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
So you never know what might happen

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Bobby Black Wolf says it has stopped Waluigi

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Hey never say never

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Until that tenth character is announced

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Not that I want to give false hope but

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I don't know I feel like they

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Weren't originally planning to do a

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Second set of DLC I feel like

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
And now they're doing it so they've had enough time

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
To hear the fan feedback and they might do it

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Who knows but I think

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
If Waluigi does happen it will be the very

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Very last one

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Act F says Little Mac was an assist trophy

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
In Brawl before he became a full character in

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Smash 4 yes I knew there was like one

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
That like got upgraded but I guess that

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Wouldn't have really been within the same game

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
So was that everything

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
From the Nintendo Direct Loki?

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Yeah pretty much So what did you think overall

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Of the Direct and what you

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
I mean if you didn't watch it the highlights I guess

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
I didn't really watch it

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
I mean

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
I don't know

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
It's alright there wasn't really anything

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
That was super exciting about

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Unfortunately I'm not a huge fan of Clubhouse games

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
I'm sure it's a great game

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Don't really care that

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Bioshock Infinite and all that says to be important to

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
The other system I have it on green systems already

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
So it's like eh I don't really

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Need it

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
I don't know

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
There's nothing super exciting coming out of that

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Unfortunately

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Well it was a mini so you know it wasn't

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Like I guess I don't know what the difference is

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
It was still 30 minutes they could have just called

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
It a regular Direct and it probably would have been fine

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
For me the Xenoblade stuff

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
That remake looks hot

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
I'm definitely going to buy that when it comes out

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
They definitely kind of took a deep dive into that

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
A little bit because I don't know if we'll get

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Maybe there will be a special Direct

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I guess before June there ought to be another Direct

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Of sorts so they'll probably show even more on that game

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
But I'm definitely going to pick that up when it comes out

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
And otherwise

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Yeah like the 2K games are a little bit like

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Okay I already kind of have like all of the

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Things I want on Playstation already

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
But I guess cool for the Nintendo exclusive folks

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Or some folks are saying in chat

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
If you really want to play it in a portable setting

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Which isn't for me

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
But maybe it's for you so cool

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
And then some of the

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Clubhouse games obviously I'm a very big fan of

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
So those were some nice little surprises

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
It wasn't like an oh my god

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Type of thing but it was some nice surprises

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Nice little treats

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Especially when there's a lot of shit news in the world right now

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
It was kind of nice to have something a little bit like

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Oh I have this to look forward to that's a nice thing

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
I hope they just did a mini

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Just to shut up all the Twitter trolls

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
That beg for a Nintendo Direct every time

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Well I don't think they did it just for that reason

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
But clearly Nintendo had a few things

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
That they just wanted to like drop on people

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
Because what they put out that Bravely Default 2 demo

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
They put out Panzer Dragoon

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Came out day and date

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
They started taking your money

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
For clubhouse games

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
So they kind of had a backlog

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Maybe a small backlog of things

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
They just kind of wanted to get out there

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
And make sure people knew about

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
So I think it kind of served its purpose in that regard

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
So

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
AgDef says if it was a big Direct

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
There would be like a big announcement

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
And they probably would have given you more time too

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
They probably would have said we'll do one tomorrow

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Instead of

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Did they say later did they drop one the same day

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Or did they give you a days notice

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
I don't remember

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Yeah

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
So those are some of the comments from our chat room

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Oh interesting AJ Twist says

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Maybe it was called a mini Direct

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Because there was no human host

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
That's an interesting thought as well

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Is that they didn't

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Yeah they didn't have anybody

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
From Nintendo either Japan

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Or America or anyone really

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Talking us through the different announcements

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
So that is a very very good point

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Maybe that's one of the differences between

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
A mini and a regular Direct

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
And perhaps in this era of social distancing

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Where many Nintendo people

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Are working from home

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Maybe they weren't able to get all the footage they needed in time

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Although you know many of these Directs

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
They filmed that stuff way in advance

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
So you know

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
The world has changed very fast

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
In the scope of two to three weeks

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
And I would bet they already knew what was going in this Direct

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Like a month ago

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
For the most part they knew this Direct at least a month ago

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
If not even further back

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
I would bet

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
E3's Direct or I'm using my quotey fingers

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
E3's Direct

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
The inevitable June Direct

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
That Nintendo I guess can drop at any point they want to now

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
That Direct

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
They probably already at least have their outline

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Of what's gonna be in that

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
And they're probably starting to script that out

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
And then they'll shoot that bit by bit

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
That will have live talking faces with that

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
So

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Anyway, alright so Nintendo Direct

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
A nice pleasant surprise from Nintendo this week

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
So let's talk a little bit about the types of games

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
That we have been playing this week

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Since Dark Soccer is not here tonight

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
We'll start with you Loki, how was your gaming week?

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
I didn't play much of anything

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Aside from

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Just

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Forna

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Because I've been trying to fix my computer

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
So

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Didn't get around too much

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I have started working on

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Putting StepMania in the DDR cabinet

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Because we have been using it a bit more

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
I just haven't really been playing too much

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
But like literally right now

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I have the PC for that cabinet

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
On my desk here

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
I've been copying songs over

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Probably should

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
I need to get everything loaded in

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
So that I can test it

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
But it's almost

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Probably pretty close to being ready to go

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
I just need to mount the PC onto

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Like a board or something

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
So I can set it in there

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Figure out how to wire it up

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
So I can switch between the PC

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
And the

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Actual System 573 board

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
That's in there

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Yeah I was gonna say I saw on Twitter

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Or Facebook or something I saw a video

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Of a Dance Dance Revolution machine you have in your garage

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
So did that kind of awaken

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
The I want to do something else with this

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Machine sort of part within you

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Well I just had

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
A lot of time where I wasn't able to

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Work on stuff or we

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Didn't have to go anywhere so I had a lot of time to

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Kind of

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Put all that together and earlier

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
We got redownloading packs and everything

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
And then I finally found all the

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Download packs that I had and I was like

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Oh man

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
I just have to

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
What I'm doing now is I'm kind of setting it up to test it

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
I was originally wanting to make my own

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Theme and everything for it

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
But I think I'm gonna put that on the back burner for now

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Until I just want to get it

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Running and get it going and then

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
I'll do themes and all that stuff

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Later but I have to sort out

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
How I want to sort all of the songs

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
That are in there

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
I think I want to kind of do it more like extreme

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Where has it kind of by

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Mix that's come out and then

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Of course

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
I think A.C.E. might be the

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Dance System Revolution A

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
I think they have it

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Organized somewhat similar

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
I want to do it like that

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Probably the theme I'm going with

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Is it's a fan made theme

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Called Supernova 3

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
It kind of looks like the old

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Supernova or even like

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Extreme setups with the song wheel

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
And everything

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
It seems to be pretty lightweight

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
I'll probably do that

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Cause I mean it should be pretty fast

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
I think I had originally tested it with the

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
A.C.E. theme on there

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
But we'll see

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
When I end up doing mine it'll be much fancier

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
And probably a little bit more unique

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Ok alright adventures in Loki's

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
DDR machine

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
So for my gaming week so I've been playing

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
A lot cause you know video games help pass

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
The time sadly for discussion

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Purposes I've been playing a lot of the same things

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
I usually play like continuing to play Final Fantasy

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
14 games like that

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
And MMO's are a great like social

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Thing right now and you can't really like go outside and be

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Social so I think that's why I tend to

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Sink a lot of hours into something like Final Fantasy 14

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Been trying to play the

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
GPS games on those rare occasions

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
I go out and walk like obviously

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
You know I can't really go out and do anything too crazy

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
But like last night we

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Drove to a restaurant to get pickup food

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
And I was like Alan can you drive

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
So I can play Orna while you drive

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
So he agreed to do that

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
So that was kind of nice so I was able to get some GPS gaming

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
In there and I do a little bit on my walks

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
As well but haven't been doing anything too

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Crazy with that for obvious reasons

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Still continuing on Diablo 3 as well

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
I did make sure to play

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
A new game this week because

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Since I do have

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
All this time and I have

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Xbox Game Pass along with

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Many other ways to play a variety of

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Different games such as like the free games they give

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
On the Epic Store you know

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
And giveaways here and there and everywhere

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
There's no shortage of games in the backlog

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
To play so one of the games I decided to

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Check out this week which is on

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Xbox Game Pass although apparently it's

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Going away soon because it does say it's

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Like a limited amount of time left so

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
I don't know if I just started this game in time for it to

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Leave at the beginning of the month I don't know

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
But it's a game called Kingsway

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
So what this game is

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
It's like an RPG

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
But the RPG it's like a

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Classic you know swords and sorcery

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Type of RPG like a Final Fantasy

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
English thing but it's

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Framed around

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
An operating system

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
And it looks like an

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Old operating system like a

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Windows 3.1 operating system

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
From like 1994

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Or something where you

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Like double click on the world map

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Window to bring up the map

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
And as you click where to go

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
You see your little character move and a little progress bar

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
And you can hear like it really emulates

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Like a little disk drive going

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Making the little noises the disk drives would do

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
And then like different windows will pop up

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Like if you run into a monster a window will pop up

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
And you have to like fight it and so you

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Do your inventory management through

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Windows so it's really

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Clever how they

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Kind of built this concept of

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
We're going to do an RPG but it's going to be based

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Within an operating system so it's

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Like Windows the RPG but it's

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Kind of clever and I

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Think people who probably grew up

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Around that era like I think of

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Somebody like Bobby Blackwolf and I know

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
He's a big fan of these types of old

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
MS-DOS games back in the day

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
I think he would really get a kick out of this game

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
But I'm not sure a lot of

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Folks like let's say

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
By the time you were born

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Uh you know modern

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
PCs and Windows XP and all that

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Stuff was already kind of the norm by the time you

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Were a child I don't know if there's

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Going to be as much here for you because it's not

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Going to be the same type of nostalgia trip

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
But I think the nostalgia trip for

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Gamers of a certain age is kind of

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Fun so it's one of those games that's worth

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Checking out especially if you have Xbox

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Game Pass anyway

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
I don't think it's on Xbox

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
It wouldn't make sense why it would be on Xbox

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
The console because obviously it's very mouse

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Driven so it's the type of thing that strikes me as

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Very like a PC thing so if you have it

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
You might as well check it out if

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
You can it might be leaving

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Game Pass very very soon

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
I believe so

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
If it's in the leaving soon

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Area of Game Pass then it goes away on the

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
31st well I guess I'm glad I played

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
It when I could I've been eyeing

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
It says Bobby I remember seeing

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
It all the PR for it from adult

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Swim games yeah it's published by them

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
As shown under Matt says

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Yeah I could play at home too I just need to get out

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Move around being inside is

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Maddening I know oh that's a response to something

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
It was Act F was saying in chat

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Yeah it's

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
You got to find that right balance of

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Going outside I haven't been going outside enough

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Quite frankly but I kind of get sick

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Of the same old walk like since

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
I live like right and without giving away my

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Address here on the program

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Since I live right in the heart of

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Suburbia it's like within walking

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Distance is a park

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
And if I want to walk a really

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Long distance I could get to a couple other parks

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
But that's a

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Long and it's like it's like a commitment

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
It's like if I walk all the way to one of the other parks

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Then I got to walk back so

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
I mean I guess I could get in the car and drive

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Somewhere but then you get into all these problems

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Of well if you drive to the

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Park that everyone wants to go to

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Then it's too crowded and it defeats

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
The purpose that was a problem they were having

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
With the beaches and stuff right

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
So you got to find that right balance it's tricky

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
But luckily thanks to things like

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Pokemon Go and Ingress

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
And the other GPS things I've played over the years

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
I have a pretty good sense of

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Where all the big parks are in town

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
That don't get too crowded

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
So I guess that part is kind of nice

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
So that's good

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
And there's always like the river

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
I have been tempted to go down

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
To Capitol Park do you think they'd throw people

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Out of Capitol Park I don't think they would

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
It's still very wide open you can keep your space

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
From people there as long as it's not swarming with people

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
But I don't know like I don't want to be

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
That person you know

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
That's setting a bad example so

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Or just putting myself at risk quite frankly

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
But yeah I miss those really

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Dense Pokemon places like Capitol Park

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Would be fun so

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Anyway well that's enough for my gaming week

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
So a lot of the same old stuff but I'm trying

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
To squeeze in at least one new game a week

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
While I'm here at home catching up

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
On the backlog a little bit I already know what game

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
I want to play for next week except

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
I forgot the name of it but it was another game

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
On Xbox Game Pass that totally looked like

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
It looks like it's Devil's Crush or Alien's Crush

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Or something like that like it's another pinball game

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
And I think it's even called like Demon something

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Somebody in chat will yell it out I'm sure

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
But that is the game I wanted to get around to it this week

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
But I didn't get to it so that's the game I definitely

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Want to check out for next week so

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
That game looks really cool so

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Alright

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
See a Tiberian chat talking about

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
The beaches stuff

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
It's interesting how the social game

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Swarm what Foursquare originally

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Was is now not

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Awarding as many points if you're going outside

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Of a home area and when you choose

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
To do something that's not like a housing

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Development it pops up and says

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Stay home that's kind of an interesting use

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Of some of those GPS things

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
It is interesting seeing how a lot of those things have had to

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Adapt things like Pokemon Go

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Have kind of had to change how the game works

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
A little bit

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
To get beyond Minecraft Earth

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Did something similar I heard this week

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Have you checked that out?

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
I heard Minecraft Earth did something

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Yeah so they did this thing

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
I checked it out for a second and I saw

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
It's turning very much into

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
A regular mobile game

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
So what they added is

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
These runes that basically

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
If you play Minecraft Earth

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
So part of the game is just collecting

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
The tappables that are on the screen to get

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
All the blocks which really if you

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Just drive around you're going to have a ton

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Of stuff

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
So they have it like

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Parks there's these things called adventures

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Where you can get additional blocks

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
And you also get experience

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
And other things

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Then they have this AR interactive

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Thing that you do so

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
What these runes do is they

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Cause you to spawn and adventure

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Like

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Wherever you're at

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
So they give you one for free

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
To be able to spawn one of those

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Adventures

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
It's only the taste that's free

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
And then after that you got paid for it

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Use your rubies

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Or whatever they're in the game

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
But you earn those pretty quick

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
I didn't see where I could actually spend those

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
To do that

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
And ever since I haven't played the game

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
In a long time so now it's just like

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Full of like different

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
XP boosts and different

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Food boosts and HP boosts

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
And I'm like oh my god

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
This is way too

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Just like demanding of

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Your money it's just like come on

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Pay pay pay pay

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
That kind of really turns me off from playing that game

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
S2100 Matt says

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Demons Tilt was the name of the game I was trying to think of

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Yes that is it you got it

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Interesting S2100 Matt says

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Waze yells at you when you open it up asking if you really

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Need to be outside right now really

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Because I've been a good boy

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
And following all the rules I haven't seen all the apps

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Doing these things so that's very

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
That's really interesting

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Interesting how these apps have had to adapt

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Let's just hope it doesn't go on

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Forever and you know

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
If we happen to have some folks

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
That are working

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
In the healthcare industry and really on the

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Front lines of what's going on right now

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Thank you for what you guys are doing

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
I know it really can't be fun right now

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
So thank you so much

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Hell grocery store employees

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
And Costco employees that really

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Can't be fun either right now so

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
A big thanks to everybody that's

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Really stepping up in this time

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Of I can't believe

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
It's actually happening this

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Alright anyhow let's move on

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Back to video games and traveling

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Around the globe

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Checking out the latest and greatest in gaming news

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Because while folks are still working

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
From home and while the world is getting used to

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
What's going on right now there is still

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
More gaming news

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Such as Loki starting us off

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Kind of a follow up

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
To something from last week kind of sort of right

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Yeah so we talked a little bit last week

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
About how GameStop is considering them

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
An essential

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Retailer and

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
That they need to stay open during this whole

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Corona outbreak thing

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
However they're not the only

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Game company to have done that

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
So there's another retailer by the name of

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Game Exchange

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Let's make sure we're hating on everybody appropriately

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Let's make sure we've

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Saved enough of our internet rage for other

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Asshole companies

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Yeah so they're looking mostly like Texas

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Arkansas like the southern east

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Or southeast of the US

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
And apparently

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
They have done something

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Similar so they're doing the curbside

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Pick up options as well

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
But

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
There's not really

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
The precautions being taken

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
They've basically said that

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Yes they're an essential retailer

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
And that they're providing

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Them with

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Sanitizing products and stuff like that

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
But much like the whole GameStop thing

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
That's not necessarily

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Being available

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
And it's not necessarily happening

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Like they're describing

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
So some of the employees are very frustrated with that

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Basically saying that they don't want us to

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Close at all

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
If any employee chooses not to work

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Then they're told that they will not be paid

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Since they are not working

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
This even goes for salary managers as well

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
And then of course they're saying

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
We've got the order to shelter

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
In place today from the county judge

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
I hope that the higher ups would do the right thing

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
And not put up a fight

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
And put their employees at health risk

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
But it appears that they have no interest

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
In closing the doors as the pandemic has progressed

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Corporate has declined

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
To stop practicing

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Stopping the practice of accepting

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Trades

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Our location is located right next door to a medical clinic

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
That takes walk-ins

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
In a time where there's a global pandemic

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Keeping the specific location

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Open next door to a place where there are patients

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
With illness is madness

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Funny enough actually

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
So along with this

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
I saw a follow-up talking about

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
The GameStop practices

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
And what they're instructing their employees to do

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
As far as

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
That delivering to the doorway

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Type thing

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
So they're literally telling them to

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Take

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
A GameStop plastic retail bag

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
And just put that around their hand

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
As a glove

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
To be able to hand games

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
And payment methods

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Back and forth to people

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
It's ridiculous

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
You really

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Shouldn't be exchanging things like

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Credit cards and money right now

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Unless it's at a truly essential business

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Like a grocery store

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Even then

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Now is the time to check out Apple Pay

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Or Google Pay

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
The contact type transactions

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Tap to transact type thing

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Yeah exactly

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
It's ridiculous

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Apparently

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
They feel that they need to

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Do this in order to stay open

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
I don't know if it's necessarily just

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Capitalizing on it or the fact that

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
A lot of these independent retailers

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Even though this is a pretty sizable one

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Aren't doing that well

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
If you can think about GameStop struggling

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
And they have direct relationships

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
With all of these publishers

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Game companies or retailers

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Like Game Exchange

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
They have to purchase their distribution

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
I know because we used to sell to them

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
So

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
They have it even worse than GameStop

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
As far as being able to get product

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
On time

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
The cost keeping that low

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
And having these special incentives

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
To get people to come into their store

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
So that's even harder for them

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
And if GameStop's

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Literally running

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Their business to the ground

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
In fact I think they're closing another 300 locations soon

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Then

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
It's just gonna

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Hit them even harder

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Still shouldn't put employees in danger

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Because of that, that's ridiculous

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
But it's

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
A very complex situation

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
That really they should be sending those employees home

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Especially since GameStop did that now

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
To a certain extent

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
If you're thinking of the profits

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Before the employees

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Then obviously you're a problem

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
And also

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
What's the pay cut

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
And I say this every time

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Or the CEO

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
We never hear the talk about that

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Well actually I will say

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
In non-gaming related things

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
We are starting to see that more and more

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Like I think we're seeing those articles around social media

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
That there are some companies

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
And of course now that I need to recall them in the moment

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
I can't think of who

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
But there are some companies that are

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Like the CEO, I was reading one about some CEO

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
That was dropping his pay to 10,000

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
This year

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
To try to use the extra money

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
To make sure they're taken care of and so forth

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
And yes, good job

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
That is what CEOs should be

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
A $10,000 salary

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Heck, he could take maybe a little more

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
A reasonable salary is fine

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
But use that extra money

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
When you're the type of CEO that's making millions

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
To give back to your employees

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
I think that is

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
All we would like to see somebody do

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Devil's advocate

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
What if they're not necessarily thinking of the profits

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
They're just thinking about staying operational

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
With all

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
And that's what I think that they're doing

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Is trying to stay operational

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
But at the same time

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Everybody's thinking about that

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
But you can't put your employees in danger

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
To stay operational

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
You just have to

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Reduce the number of stores you have

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
A responsible upper management team

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Has a plan

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Has a pandemic type of plan

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Or a contingency plan

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
I can tell you every company I've worked for

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
I haven't worked for a lot of companies

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Because I was with one for 14 years

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
But the companies I did work for

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Always had a plan for

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
What if we get in a situation

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Where all the computers go down

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Or what if we get in a situation

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
And I distinctly remember

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
The first company I worked for for 14 years

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Which was a major health insurer

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Because of the fact they were a health care insurer

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
And people are going to want to use health care

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
They had specifically a pandemic plan

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Granted I haven't worked there in several years

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
So I have no idea if they've actually

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Enacted that same plan or what

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
But they actually have these types of plans

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
So it is kind of your responsibility

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
As the upper management and the board

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
To be thinking about these types of things

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
You should have had a plan for curbside pickup

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
And all this type of stuff a long time ago

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Now I realize

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
There's infinite combinations

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Of things to plan for

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
And not everything's going to be perfect

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
And nobody could have truly predicted this COVID situation

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
I do understand all of that

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
But don't you get the sense

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Aren't you kind of feeling like

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Nothing was planned

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Don't you kind of see those two extremes

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
In this scenario

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Yes

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
At the same time I do see that

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
And I think it's more

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
They may have been

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Looking at well GameStop doing it

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
And we can do it as well

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
And that's a lot of the sentiment

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
I used to get with a lot of the independent

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Retailers that I dealt with

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Was if GameStop for example

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Was breaking the street on a title

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Then they feel well it's fine if we do it then

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
So I think

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
That's kind of what they're looking at here

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
They're basically saying that

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Oh

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Well if they're doing it then we can do it

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Alright

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Anyway it's a tricky

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Scenario but I kind of think ultimately

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
The reality of what's going to happen

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
In light of all these

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Stories that are coming out and things

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
I think this might be the situation

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
That pushes more people to go digital

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
That hadn't considered it before

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
I don't think physical is going away

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
I don't think my opinion has really changed on that

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Whatsoever but because

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Just CDs and music

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
That is primarily digital

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
At this point but there are still

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Collectors and collectibles

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
You can still find

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Those CDs and so forth they're not as easy to find

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
As they once were but you can still order them

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
I kind of think that is a direction

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
That gaming is kind of headed in

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Eventually and I think this kind of

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Accelerates that a little bit

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Than maybe what we were thinking before

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
We were kind of already thinking

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
That gaming was kind of going that way anyway

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
And I think these two months

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
Of people don't really want to go out to the store

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
I mean there's this

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
GameStop and GameExchange

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
They got their plans on how to stay open

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
But the reality is

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Speaking for myself

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
I'm not going to a fucking game store right now

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
Either I'm going to get it on Amazon

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
And just wait a few extra days

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
An extra week if I need to

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Because it's something that's not essential

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Or maybe even longer than that because it's a game

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Or I'm just going to buy a digital because

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
You know what that's my other option right now

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
It's not the way I prefer to buy games

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
But if it's something that I have to play

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Right now like Final Fantasy 7 Remake

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Then I'll just buy it digital

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Even though that's not really what I wanted to do

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Anything else can either wait or you know whatever

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
So

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Well yeah and I think a lot of major releases

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Anyways are being pushed back

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Because of this whole situation so

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
I don't think there's a whole lot of stuff that we have to

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
Jump out and run out to get right now

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Yeah so Lady Gaga pushed

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Back her album so you know that was

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
The thing I'm sure you all were waiting for so

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Now that has been pushed back

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
So yeah I think really

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Like as far as gaming goes I feel like

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
The Final Fantasy 7 Remake was the only

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Big thing I was hearing about for April

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
I don't know what April looks like for like triple A titles

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Maybe some of you guys in chat know more

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
But you know I think

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
I think it was really we're getting

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
I don't think we know a lot of the big stuff

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Yet because we're in a new console year

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
So I feel like we're still waiting on a lot of the big

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Console stuff oh is Last of Us 2

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
An April game

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
That's the other one that's escaping my mind

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Right now was Last of Us 2 an April game

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Or is that like later does he keep pushing that one back

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
Um I thought

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
I thought that got pushed

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
I thought that was a June game

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Ok Act F says May

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
I know that I was like what's Playstation got

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Oh yeah lots of difference

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Alright well anyway let's move on

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Let's talk about this story which has to do

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
With kind of a

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Social media trend gaming

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Companies coming together to start this

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Campaign with

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
WHO the World Health Organization

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
So it's kind of interesting to see

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Official government entities that are

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Right in the midst of this whole thing coming together

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
With gaming companies to create

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
This awareness of what they're calling

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Hashtag play a part

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Together and that's kind of a play on the

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Word apart because it's

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Playing games across a distance but

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
You're also playing your part by

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Staying home and not spreading this

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Horrible disease so

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
The World Health Organization

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
And the industry have come together to

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Launch this awareness campaign play a part

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Together it encourages physical distancing

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
With special events, exclusives

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Activities, rewards

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
And inspiration for different

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Popular games. Some of the companies

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Participating, Activision Blizzard

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Zynga, one of your favorites I'm sure

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Big Fish Games

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Let's see Kabam

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Pocket Gems, Riot Games is in on this

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Snap, Twitch

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Is actually taking part in this because I think

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Twitch just did their big marathon yesterday right?

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
They had a big thing

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Going on yesterday

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
The city is also in on this too as is

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
YouTube so there's lots of different types of

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Elements of gaming that are in on this

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Trend of

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Hashtag play a part together

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
And it's interesting

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Because some journalists are

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Noting the World Health Organization

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Just last year was talking

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
About gaming disorder

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
You know people that play too many

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Video games whereas now

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
It's a little different. A spokesperson

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
The United States ambassador to the

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
World Health Organization Ray Chambers said

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
In a statement that during this

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Time frame of COVID and everything

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
He applauds what's

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Quote the ingenuity of partners from

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
All sectors who are stepping up

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
To assist efforts to combat the

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
COVID-19 pandemic

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
So the World Health Organization is trying to get the global

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Gaming industry to get millions

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
That's another thing to note it's global

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Gaming is global right? Riot Games has a huge

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Presence in Asia

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Many different Asian countries

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Not just China where we know that

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
COVID is kind of I don't want to say it's

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Taking its course but we know that the curve is

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Starting to come down in China but we got all these

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Other countries like I think I'm not sure

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Where Taiwan is at

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Or you know some of these

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Other places Japan I think was just

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Well I don't know if Riot Games and League of Legends

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Is as big there but

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
You know there's just there's other countries

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Where you know these some of these companies have a big

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Presence it's not just the US

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
That needs to work on flattening the curve

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
As this virus is spreading around

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
So

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Also trying to encourage

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Game players and so forth

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
To follow hand hygiene

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
And physical distancing and

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
So forth so it's kind of

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
It's kind of a neat little awareness campaign

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
I'm very curious to

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
See what these companies start

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
To do like in games and so forth

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
But because they're talking

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
About like maybe like rewards

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
And things to get people to play games online

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
But we'll see as that

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Develops right now

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
So

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
I'm kind of also curious

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
For those of you out there in the chat room

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
And Loki maybe you have a piece to say on this too

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
It seems like gaming

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
Is just becoming

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
More and more prevalent in these times

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Anyway like I see a

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
A sizable number of people on Facebook

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Starting to stream

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
Jackbox games that's a company

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
That's really thriving in light of what's going on

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Like it's weird to talk about

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Like oh your company's doing great

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Because of this horrible situation going on

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
But it is what it is

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Like I feel like so many people are learning

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
About Jackbox games right now

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
Because more and more people are playing

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
That on Zoom meetings

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
You know with streamer mode

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
And things like that people are getting together to play

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Jackbox

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Like my cousin who I didn't even think

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Ever played video games was posting

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
About this earlier today trying to get people together

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
To play Drawful or something

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
On a stream and so it really does

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Seem like video games are a great

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Way for people to be and of course Animal Crossing

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
We talked about earlier in the show

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Video games have been a great way for people to

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Still interact even when they're

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Staying at home

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Loki have you kind of noticed an upward trend

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
In social media or have you been invited or seen

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Any of this like online gaming stuff that didn't

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Really exist previously

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
I mean obviously we've seen a lot of

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Stories about different

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Boarding

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Entities going to their

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Esports kind of equivalent

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
And doing stuff that way so I think we're going to see

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
A big

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Especially if it takes off you know

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
A lot more popularity with esports

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Because of this whole having to

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Stay away from everybody

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Yeah definitely I mean I've seen

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
A lot more people playing stuff online

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
I haven't been invited to do anything but

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
That's fine

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
I've just been noticing

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
A lot of people doing that

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
In chat PodCulture says you can play

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Cards Against Humanity online now

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Yeah I got I mean there's all sorts

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Of like Cards Against Humanity like Sims

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
There was one Zizzix it's got a really weird name

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Somebody invited me to play that the other night

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
So I was playing that for a little bit and that was fun

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
I had the most points too when I left just saying

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
And then that reminds me

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
That same group has been playing Dungeons and Dragons

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
You want to go old school

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Maybe not so much it's not so much video games

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
But you know tabletop

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Even have their place right now

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
And I know friends that do

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Like a weekly or is it monthly

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
They do like a monthly tabletop gaming meetup

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
And so since they couldn't do that this month

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
They did it online and they were playing like

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Dominion and Catan and those types of things online

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Because there's a lot of sites where you can

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Do that so it's kind of interesting to see

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
How people are playing through that

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Oh and Bobby Blackwolf points out tabletop

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Simulator even works in VR

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
See Bobby we need clubhouse

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Games more than ever see by the time clubhouse

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Games comes out hopefully we're on the other

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
End of this curve and everything and we're

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Talking about getting back to some sort of normalcy

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
We need clubhouse

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Games right now dang it so

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Act Def says the game

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Show games like Wheel of Fortune

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
And Jeopardy and things like that

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Good call good call

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
And SHO 100 Matt talking about you know

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
The increased what are the sports channels

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Doing sports broadcasting networks

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Are starving for contact and they're turning

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Or content excuse me and they're turning to

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Wrestling and sports movies

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Esports time now to get

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
All the eyes on it yeah and

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
I feel like Twitch there's just so many more

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
People broadcasting on Twitch all at once now

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Too just because

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
You can't go outside

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Right now so it's just interesting to see

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
How that's all taken off so anyway

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Play a part together

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Interesting awareness campaign for the world

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Well let's move on with some more news Loki

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Yeah speaking of more

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
You know campaigns for

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
The whole

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
COVID-19 situation

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
We have games done quick

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
Tackling

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Some relief for COVID-19

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
With their brand new Corona

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Relief done quick

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
It's going to be an event that's going to be online

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Of course from April 17th through the 19th

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
And the

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
I'm assuming all durations

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Or all donations are going to direct

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Relief for COVID-19

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
And then of course they're saying that

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
The summer games done quick has been postponed

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
As well it was

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Originally scheduled for June 21st

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
But now it's being pushed back

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
To August 16th instead

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Probably

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
A good idea in light of everything going on

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Yes

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
So

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Yeah be interesting to see

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
You know what

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
I want to see what they're going to be running in that

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Yeah and it's going to be interesting to see how that

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Yeah and it's going to be interesting to see how that's going to all be set up

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
With the social distancing as well

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Although I believe that channel

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Has done plenty of speed runs

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
When there's not

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
A hotel convention type of thing going on

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
And they just

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
They do like a remote like they're

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Hosting somebody else's stream essentially

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Or maybe doing it through Skype or Discord

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Video feed or something like that

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
So I'm sure there's plenty of ways to do it

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
So it'll be kind of interesting to see

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
How well received something like that is

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
And it does do very well

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
And then of course I'm sure everybody will be

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Very much looking forward to getting back together in person

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
And it's funny because

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Bobby was talking about this a little bit on his show tonight

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Because as many of you know

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
He applied this year to be one of the hosts

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Which is very

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
You know we're rooting for him

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
But if he weren't to get it we would understand

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Because there's tons of people that are

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Applying to be hosts of these things

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
But he was kind of talking a little bit about

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
You know well if they can do this online

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
There's going to be some people that would say

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Well do it online all the time but at the same time

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
It kind of loses something like it's

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
There's something about being all in the same room together

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
You know and hearing the big cheers

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
And things like that and

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
I kind of replied to that I was like sounds familiar

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Because it kind of reminds me of like OLR

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Like we're able to do this show over Discord

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
But it's

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
It's more fun when it's in person and we can play off each other

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
A lot easier and the laughter is more contagious

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Than it is over Discord

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
You know so

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Looking forward to being back to normal soon

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
That's for sure

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
And Bobby Blackwell points out

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Games Done Quick they do remote speedruns every week

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
They do entire weekend marathons completely online

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Yeah I figure like I stumbled on one of those marathons once

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
So the

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Corona thing

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
The speedrun they're going to do for

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Corona virus relief

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Efforts and so forth is not going to be

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Probably a technical challenge whatsoever

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Hopefully they can get lots of eyes on that

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
I'm sure they'll get support from Twitch though

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Some front page love and things like that

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
And just general awareness on social media

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
And so forth that they'll get some

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Good donations for that

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
And Questbuster talking about what's

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Going on overseas

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
The ESA not to be confused

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
With the E3 people this would be I think it's

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
European speedrunning association I may have got

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
The acronym wrong but essentially that's what it is

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
They just hosted a UK

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Speedrunning event that finished today and they're

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Planning an online only week of runs in April

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
As well so

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
And since you can participate globally why not

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
You can check that out too as well if you want

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
So best of luck to everybody involved

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
With games done quick with the Corona

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Relief efforts

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Let's talk a little more about Animal Crossing

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Since it's what a lot of people are talking about

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Right now but actually what I want to talk

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
About is Animal Crossing Pocket

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Camp yeah that's not the current

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
One the current one is New Horizons

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Pocket camp is the cell phone game

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Remember that one you would think a lot of people

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Have thrown that app in the garbage now that

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
New Horizons has come out but that's

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Yes it's hot garbage

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
But that's actually not the case

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Pocket camp is apparently more popular

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Than ever maybe because

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
With all this talk of

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Animal Crossing on social media

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Not everybody has a switch

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
So maybe some folks are turning to the mobile

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Version to get their fix a little bit

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Apparently players spending on March

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
21st a single day

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Came in at a quarter of a million dollars

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
That was spending in one day

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
That's not bad the game's best day

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Since March 2nd

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
The game has generated approximately

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
3.6 million dollars for the month

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
Downloads rose by 150

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Percent and

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
670,000 installs the week

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Of March 16th which is when the

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Shelter in place started for many many people

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
So that's pretty

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Interesting how that game has been getting some

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Speed but I would bet it's all the people

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
That are like what's this about

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
And they don't have a Nintendo switch so they

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
This is their easiest way to check that out

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Is through pocket cap

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Which is a very different Animal Crossing experience

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
I wasn't really into it

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
But that's just me DarkSakura loved it

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
I was not into it it sounded good on paper

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Animal Crossing on a cell phone

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Sounds awesome and it was garbage

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
I didn't care for it but again

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
I have other friends that are super into Animal Crossing

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
That love it and I consider myself

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Like an Animal Crossing fan

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
But I just didn't care for this one

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
I just prefer the Nintendo console based ones

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
And some folks

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
You know in this

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Interesting day and age of all the different

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Work from home things

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
You got some people that are using Zoom to work from home

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Or maybe something like WebEx

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
To get people together or Adobe Connect

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
There's many many different ways to try to bring

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Co-workers together in this day and age

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Some people are using Animal Crossing

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
I think this is maybe meant to be

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
A little more parody and not that serious

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
But there was a

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
Japanese company that was posting some of the pros and cons

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Of working remotely through Animal Crossing

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
And the pro

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
No voice chat

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Because they have no network features whatsoever

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Well you can voice chat through the Nintendo app

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Technically

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Technically

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Actually I will give a shout out to the Nintendo app

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
It is proving to be useful for the first time ever

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Well I don't know maybe some folks thought

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
Splatoon's tie-ins were pretty good

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
But

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Excuse me

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
For Animal Crossing

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
The fact that you can use the keyboard

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
In the app is very helpful

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
As well as the QR code reader

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
To get different patterns in your

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Town from the internet, that's very useful as well

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
So if you're playing Animal Crossing and you haven't looked at the

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Nintendo app

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
You might have forgot that was a thing

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Get back on that because it is pretty useful

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
But some of the cons

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
The Japanese company says about working from home

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Via Animal Crossing

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Can't send files

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Can't speak about confidential matters

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Meetings are constantly interrupted by talk

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Of Animal Crossing

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
And no one is using their real name

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
You know it's funny because I was in a work meeting

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
The other day and people actually asked

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Like what is something that's making you happy

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
During this time and I actually brought

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Up Animal Crossing and I was like well a new

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Animal Crossing game came out and I really love that

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Game, nobody got it

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Nobody got it

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
That's unfortunate

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
That is unfortunate because I bet a lot of them would really love it

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
If they saw it

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
I wasn't going to take the time to explain it

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
At this particular juncture

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
So

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat talking about

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Zoom and Fortnite

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
I saw a meme where people were using

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Fortnite and said that the pros over

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Zoom was that it was more stable voice

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Chat and you could shoot your co-worker

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
If they were being annoying

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
I like that idea

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
That's very good

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Alright

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
And Bobby also says I was using Zoom for

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Four years I'm a Zoom hipster

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
You know what's so fascinating to me

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
My knowledge

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Of those types of tools

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
From playing Ingress

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Is coming in really handy right now

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Because like when we had the big anomaly

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Here we were doing a lot of planning

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Stuff with Zoom

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
And so that's a tool I've been using

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
For a long time

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Because there were other things that had

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
To do with Ingress and meeting people even before then

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
And

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Slack I've used before

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
And now my company is talking about using

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Slack in this interim while we're working

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
From home and so I'm like

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
I've used it I can answer some questions

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Well Slack also is supposed to be

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Integrating with Microsoft Teams as well pretty soon

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
So you can actually

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Call somebody on Slack with

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Microsoft Teams or vice versa

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
We've all jumped on the Microsoft Teams

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
And

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
It's alright

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Slack's okay

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
I wouldn't want to see our company use it

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Permanently but it's a nice little like

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Stand in for now while we can't really see each other

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
I suppose so

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Anyhow let's

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Move on with some more stories

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Loki

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Yes so this is kind of a random thing

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
They have a brand new

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Kind of advertising campaign for

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Sega now

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
You may remember back in the 90s

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
They had the whole

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Sagata Sanchiro

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Who was their mascot

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
For the Saturn

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Well now

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
For Sega's 60th birthday

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Celebration they have

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
His real life son

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Mito Fujioka

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Playing

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
The same character

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Which is pretty funny

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
So they have this whole thing

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
For Sega's 60th

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Birthday

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
It's great we should get more

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Advertising like this for

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Companies

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
It's very Japanese

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
I just generally miss the

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Mascots from all the gaming

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
You know all those commercials in the 90s

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
And maybe early 2000s

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Where like what was the guy that worked

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
For Playstation that was in all the commercials

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
For a while

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Was kind of the mascot

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Yeah I don't remember his name

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
You know obviously Sonic was a bit of a

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Mascot for Sega for a while

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
But that stuff isn't as strong as it used to be

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
You know

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
We need the mascots. Kevin Butler, thank you Act F

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Yes Kevin Butler

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
He was the greatest fictional vice president

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Of Sony ever

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I guess the closest thing we have is

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Flo from Progressive

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
I guess

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
But that's not gaming

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
We need those gaming mascots

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
To come back like that

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Questbuster in chat says

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
The Sagata Sanchiro commercials were great

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
That actor's son is taking up the banner too now

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Well you know sometimes those things

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Kind of stay in the family. I'm thinking of

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
That social media thing that went around

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
With Mel Brooks' kid

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
And then Mel Brooks was actually in the

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Bit too but the kid

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
His kid is in his 40s

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
He's probably older than me

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Was kind of doing a little comedy bit about that whole

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Thing and that was really great

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Isn't his name Max?

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Oh I didn't realize that

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Bobby Blackwell says his kid wrote World War Z

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Really? I didn't know that

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Interesting

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Well let's move on. Let's take a trip down memory lane

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Let's look at those classics

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Shall we? In a segment we call

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
The classic game of the week

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Where every week on the show

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
We like to take a trip down memory lane to visit

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
A classic game. Usually Dark

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Sakura would take this on and step into

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
The gaming vault and find a game that she thinks

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Hey you guys should be checking

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
This game out

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
But she's not here tonight

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
So I'm gonna actually take over for tonight

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
And talk about my classic game choice

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
I think this is one you might like too though

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Loki. I'm not sure

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
I don't know if this was up your alley but it should be

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
This was actually one of my

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Favorite arcade games from back in the day

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
It is a game called

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Ramparts is the game

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Do you know this game Loki?

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
I do but I'm not a fan

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Really? I love this game

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
It's from the year

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
1990 okay

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
It's based on that specific

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Atari arcade hardware

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Games like 720 and stuff were done on

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
I remember

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Was it the Nintendo

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Or Super Nintendo version?

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
They did. There was a Super Nintendo version

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
That used mode 7 if I'm not mistaken

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
And there were two Nintendo versions

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
A lot of people don't know this

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
There was the US version

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I think Jellico did it in the US

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
And then Konami actually did it in Japan

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
And Konami kind of changed the game

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
A little bit because the game

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Is kind of like castles and pirate ships

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Sort of theming

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
And in the

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Konami NES version they

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Changed it to like samurai

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
And things like that

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
And I think maybe that's because they were

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
A little more limited in the graphics

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
They didn't really do the ocean as a thing

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
I don't know it's very interesting how they were different

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
But part of what makes Rampart kind of unique

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Is

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Rampart they say

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
They were credited anyway with being kind of a precursor

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
To tower defense games

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Because essentially that's what it was

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
You were protecting towers

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
As they were being attacked by little peons

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
That would come try to attack them

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
The peons were coming from these ships

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
That were also attacking your towers

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
With cannonballs

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
And so the game was split up into different phases

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
And for those of you that are watching along on Twitch

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
You can kind of see these different phases play out

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
One is you place the cannons

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Within your forts

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
One is it's a free for all battle

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Between cannonballs

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
So you're firing on the pirate ships

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
They're firing on your castles

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
The next phase after that is

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Put back together your castles

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
And so it's like a Tetris kind of style

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
You have Tetris like pieces

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
And you have to be able to surround

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
At least one of your castle buildings

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
With a bunch of Tetris pieces

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
If you can't do that it's game over

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
So you'll notice on the Twitch stream for those of you watching

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
This guy right now is trying to surround

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
In one bit and he did it there

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
And he's got another one that's a little smaller

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
So you can see he's kind of trying to build that together

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
For those listening on the podcast you'll just have to imagine it

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
But it's very easy to find gameplay of this game if you're interested

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
And yes it's playable in MAME

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Which I know a lot of people

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Check out their arcade games out that way

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
But it is a neat little game

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
In the original game there are six different levels

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Where you're attacking different ships

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
And then trying to repair the damage

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
And it's built into those different phases

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
There is a multiplayer version of the game

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
At least the arcade version has it

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Not all of the home ports have it

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
But some of them do

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Interestingly enough I believe Konami's NES version

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Is one of the ones that has it

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Sounds like it's one of those cases where the Japanese

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Port of the game was a little bit stronger

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
If you are playing with two or three people

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000
The arcade version had blue, red, and yellow teams

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
It was a rare three player arcade game

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Except instead of fighting against ships

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
You're fighting against each other

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
You're fighting against each other

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Your land is separated by a river

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
And you're trying to blow each other's stuff up

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
So that's kind of fun

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
So yeah some of the strategy for this game

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
It's easier to capture an unowned castle

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Than try to repair the wall around a starting castle

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
But if you kind of build close to the water

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
You can have better aim

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
So there's lots of little tricks and techniques

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
To go into this

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I was never very good at it

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
I just thought it was kind of fun to try to build

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
The biggest surrounding piece of land I could

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Where has this game been ported?

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Everywhere in the 90s

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
It was on the Super Nintendo, the Master System

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
The Mega Drive, Genesis, Atari Lynx

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
PC, Macintosh, Commodore 64

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Amiga, Atari ST, Game Boy, Game Boy Color

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
There's a lot of different ports

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
And if that's not enough for you

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
It was also included in the

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Midway Arcade Treasures compilation

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000
So if you have a Midway compilation

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
That was either on the GameCube

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
The Playstation 2, the Xbox, or the Playstation Portable

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
This game is on it

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
And if you have the later

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Arcade Origins series

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
That was on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
This game is on there as well

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
And

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
I mean they've done this game a lot haven't they

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
If you bought Gauntlet on the Game Boy Advance

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
This game was there as well

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
It was kind of like the B-side

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Like when they did Final Fight

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
And Magic Sword together

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
And I was more about Magic Sword

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
But it was kind of the B-side

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
So Rampart was available in Gauntlet

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
On the Game Boy Advance as well

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
There's also some open source games

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
That are basically clones of Rampart

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Kajani Combat and Castle Combat

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Are two of the names of those

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
So kind of neat

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
And yeah I really

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
And they say this is kind of an influencer

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Of the tower defense genre

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
So yeah one of my very favorite

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Kind of like puzzle games

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I don't know like it does

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Get a little bit old after a while

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
But it is kind of like it's so unique

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
That I can't help but if I actually

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Find one of these machines

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
I don't think they made a ton of these in the arcade

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
So I don't see them very often

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
But if I do see one I really have to play around

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
For it so there you go

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Dark Tetsuya says

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
I think there's a Japanese Famicom

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Version of this too

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Yeah I was mentioning that a little earlier

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Is that Konami made the Japanese version

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Whereas Jellico made the

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
US version

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
So it's kind of like Tetris

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Where there was two different versions of it on the NES

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Questbuster says

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
My castles are fugly because I had no idea what I was doing

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Same though

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
And Questbuster says I loved watching someone else play it

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
So I could see the cannons in action

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Especially if the arcade cab had its volume up

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Oh and something that really should

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
One thing I need to mention about this game

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Before we close up

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
It ran on a trackball

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
So you're placing all these pieces

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
You're firing all the cannons

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
They sold conversion kits for this

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
I think it would run on an old 720 machine

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Or I'm trying to think of the other

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Trackball Atari games

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
From around this era

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
But yeah it was actually a trackball game

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
And I think that's important to say because if you do end up playing a clone

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Or whatever it really helps

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
To have a mouse

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
So when you are playing it on Super Nintendo

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Or even regular Nintendo

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
You're not really able to play it with a mouse

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Or did this game support

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
The mouse peripheral

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
I don't think so

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
I think it was an NES game

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
I'm pretty sure

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
It was on both

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Because the Super Nintendo one had mode 7

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Where you could actually see your land

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
In mode 7 and it was kind of cool

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Because it was like ooh I built that and I'm seeing it in mode 7

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
So that's kind of neat

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Anyway there it is your classic game of the week

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
One of my old school faves

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
From the arcades in the 1990s

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Rampart

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
There you go my pick

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
I know that Sakura wasn't here to pick tonight

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
But hopefully she'll be back next week

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
And we'll get a pick from her

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Although next week will be April

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
So she might do a pinball game

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Stay tuned we'll see

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
For now let's move on and travel around the world quickly

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
With some rapid fire news of what's going on in the industry

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Loki

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
So since we're getting a lot of people watching Netflix

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
It's I guess appropriate that we have some Netflix news

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
So there's I guess

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Information going on saying that

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Netflix is looking to develop

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
A series

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
And they're looking to have Ryan Reynolds

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Set to produce and star in

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
I don't know if it's going to be a series or a film

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
But at the very least something

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
So

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Interesting to see

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
I'd like to see that

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
But I don't know

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Live action is going to lose some of its

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Charm I think

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
But whatever

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
I guess we'll have to see what happens

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
I thought I had heard that it might be a half and half thing

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Even though the Dark Sakura is not here

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
I had to throw out a Xanadu reference

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
For her

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
As long as we get a Netflix adaptation

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Of Brain Dead 13 then I'll be good too

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
I guess Space Ace will have to do that as well

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
And then of course

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Speaking of Netflix

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Castlevania the animated series

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Is getting a fourth season

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
So that's pretty awesome

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
And then

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Of course

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
And then of course

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
So that's pretty awesome

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Apparently

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I guess the third season just came out

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
At the beginning of this month

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
So no date yet

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
When the fourth one is going to be coming

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
But I'm glad to see that it's doing well

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
I have not really watched that series

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
I think I may have watched an episode of it

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
But I mean it sounds like it's been

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Doing pretty well

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Yeah most people that have been watching it

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Have said good things about it

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
So it's one of those things

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
But speaking of time sinks

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
You know what else got renewed on Netflix

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Which is really exciting

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
It has nothing to do with video gaming

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
But it's a game of sorts

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
The Circle got renewed for seasons 2 and 3

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
So that is really exciting news

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
As did Love is Blind

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Got renewed for seasons 2 and 3

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Both those shows are crazy

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Tiger King

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Isn't Tiger King like a documentary?

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Maybe they can't do a season 2

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
But I'm sure they'll try to figure out a way to do it

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
They found a way to do more seasons of Making a Murder

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
So we'll see

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
But

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Yeah so there's those

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
The Circle also has

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
If you're really into that show on Netflix

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
The Brazil one just came out

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
And because Netflix is international

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
You can watch The Circle Brazil

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
With English subtitles

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
So it's kind of like having another season of The Circle

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
And apparently there is a French one coming to this

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
The Circle France is coming as well

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
If you're a fan of that crap

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Like me

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Alright anyway

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Bobby Blackwolf says they're doing a season 2 of Tiger King

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
It's going to be scripted

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Kate McKinnon is in it

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
She's playing the woman

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
No way

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Isn't that just something they're talking about on Twitter

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Because like Dax Shepard is saying

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Like he has to be the main guy

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
In the movie version

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Or the inevitable version of this

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
And then what's

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Edward Norton wanted to fight him for the part

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
It's like crazy

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Oh that sounds ridiculous

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Yeah anyway

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Wow he's linking me

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
He's bringing the receipts

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
He's linking me to a Deadline article

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Apparently there is a Joe Exotic

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Limited series starring Kate McKinnon

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
You gotta be

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
shitting me

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Oh because this all got rolling

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Back in November

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
And now interest in the project

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Is picked up again because of what's going on

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
With the Netflix series

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Interesting

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
So it may not necessarily be tied to Netflix though

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
But it probably will end up there

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
We'll see

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Alright well anyway

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
On to other rapid fire news

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Let's talk about Streets of Rage 4

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Because I know some people only care about

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Streets of Rage 4 because they want to hear new

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Yuzo Koshiro music on the soundtrack

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
I don't say I can blame you

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I'm in a very similar position

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
And the good news is you will be able to get the soundtrack

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Or if you're a vinyl hipster

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Which is completely understandable

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
You can get the vinyl in summer of 2020

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
And that will be a lot of fun as well

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
So yes it has been confirmed that Streets of Rage 4

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
OST will get a digital release

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
On the same day as the game launches

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
What day is that?

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
We still don't know

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
They're just saying it will be the same day

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Soon

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
That's right

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Last week we talked about the Humble Brag

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Which was the Humble Bundles version of Nintendo Direct

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Yeah I checked that out

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
It happened

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
And what did you think?

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Well let me quickly mention

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Some of the things they talked about

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Their publishing arm is going to be getting

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
One Step from Eden on PC and Switch

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Fae Tactics as well

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
And then they talked about some partnerships

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Including Wildfire which is a stealth game

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Ambition, A Minuet of Power

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Which is a roguelike

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Proteus, not to be confused with Parodius

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Which is a sci-fi first person shooter

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Ring of Pain, a roguelike

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
With card game pacing

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
And The Iron Oath

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
A turn based RPG in a dark fantasy world

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
You actually watched it Loki, what did you think?

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
It was okay

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
I've been interested in Proteus a bit

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
I was kind of disappointed that not everything

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
That they were showing was stuff that's right around the corner

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
But

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
I mean it looked okay

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
I thought they were going to have some

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Really amazing announcements

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
But it was alright

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
More Proteus footage is good

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
I think we're definitely going to see more and more companies

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
That are kind of doing this

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
As time goes on, that's for sure

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Alright

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Well let us move on and talk about

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
World release dates and what is coming out

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
In a country near you very soon

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
So starting with the US?

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Not a whole lot, but we've got Bubble Bobble 4

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Friends on Nintendo Switch

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Persona 5

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Royale on Playstation 4

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
My friend

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Pedro on Playstation 4

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
And then last but not least

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Resident Evil 3

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
On PC, Playstation 4

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
And Xbox One

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Alright, traveling to Japan

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
And checking out the releases there

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
On the Playstation 4

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Biohazard 3

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Which of course is Resident Evil 3

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
That remake is getting its release on Playstation 4

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
On April the 3rd

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
That is a regular version and a Z version

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Is coming out there

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Shovel Knight also getting its Japanese release

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
This week, so that's kind of fun

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
I'm guessing that's a localized version

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
It may have already come out digitally

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
But this is a physical version

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
That's coming out as well

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Over on the Nintendo Switch, also seeing

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Shovel Knight as well

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Kotoba no Puzzle

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Is a game as well

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
I don't know what the hell this is

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Pika Pika Nurse Monogatari

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Now I know you might think

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
That that is some type of Pikachu thing

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
But it's not, it's like a

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Nursing simulator type of game

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
So, and that is

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
It's like Nursing Mama

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Basically, so, yeah

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Because you get to actually examine patients

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
But it's all cute and chibi

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
So, interesting

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
So that's out this week

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
And then there's a brand new Nintendo Switch Lite

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Color coming out in Japan

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
A Nintendo Switch Lite Coral version

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Is out, so

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Fun fun

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Okay, Logi

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
In the UK we've got

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Onanaki, that's coming out on

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
PlayStation 4 and Switch

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Zombie Army Trilogy

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
On a Nintendo Switch

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Persona 5 Royale

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
On PlayStation 4

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Super Epic on PlayStation 4

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
And Switch

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Resident Evil 3

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
On PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
And that's it

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Alrighty

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Let's move on to our mailbag

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Every week you guys send us emails

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
And we read some of our favorites here on the show

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Although I'm sad to say yet again

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
It looks like our mailbag was kind of empty

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
So we don't have any emails to read

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
But I will go to our Twitter

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Account because we do

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Field your tweets as well

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
At OLR over on Twitter

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
And we do have a tweet coming in this week

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
From Flaco Jones who tweeted us

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Saying, we haven't heard from Flaco

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
In a while. Hello Flaco, I hope you're well

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Flaco says, hey OLR

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
My wife has been spending the bulk of her gaming time

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
During the pandemic lockdown

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Playing Wind Waker HD

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
And she just talked to

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
A certain someone very special

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
To your show

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
And attached is a gif image of

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Tingle

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
You can't even see that, whatever

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Sorry, I was holding it up to the camera

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Tingle has made an appearance

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
In Wind Waker HD

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Good choice to catch up on the gaming backlog

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
You know, speaking of Zelda

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
I know several people that have kind of

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Restarted or picked up again

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Their Breath of the Wild games

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Because you know, talk about a game that you sink a lot of hours into

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
That's another big one as well

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Loki, any thoughts on

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Wind Waker HD and

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Tingle appearance?

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
I already made my comment on that

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Oh, what did you say? I missed it

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
I replied, dislike

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Dislike, whatever

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Don't be a hater

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Alright, so anyhow, there you go

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
So in lack of

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Emails this week, at least we got a tweet

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
And I will be encouraging more folks to send us

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Tweets for future weeks, because

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
If we're going to continue to have an empty mailbag

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Then we're going to change this segment

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
A little bit, I'm not sure I'm going to delete the

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Mailbag, but we're going to

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Kind of open it up to other

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Feedback mechanisms as well, so

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Mails and tweets, I suppose

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Don't make us go

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Late 90s, early 2000s

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Participate or die

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
No, no, I mean

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
You know, the reality is

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Less and less people use

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Email, because more and more

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
People use social media

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
And I think this is just one of those, maybe we have to

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Evolve type of things, because

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
People just aren't really using their email accounts

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Like they used to, but it's very easy to send a tweet

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
And you know, I

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Probably should dust off the Facebook

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
And try to get some more posts on there

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
It's hard for me to put together this show

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
And be the social media guy, so

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
You know, we'll see, we'll do it again

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
So, alright

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Dark Tetsuya says, just do what you did with

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
FUs, make it as needed if we do

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Get any. The difference between this and FUs

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Though is that, you know, this is the show where every gamer

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Has a voice, and especially right now

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Where we're having to use Discord to do the show, so we're not

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Really doing calls on Discord

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
And we weren't really getting a lot of those

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Either, I think we just need to rethink

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Some of the ways that we're letting people participate

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
And so, you know what I need to do

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
I just need to open an Animal Crossing

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Town during the show, and you can participate

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
By coming to visit and saying

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Your message is there. That's staying

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
On top of trends, right? So, anyway

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Hey, I'm open to ideas

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
If you think there's a way we should be

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Getting more folks to interact with our show that we're not doing

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Tweet me, email me

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Anything, text me

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
If you know my number, I'll take anything

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
So, alright

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Ooh, so

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
So, you want to talk about participation

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Bobby just got some late-breaking news

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
For himself, Bobby said

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
In chat, breaking news

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
He has Tommy Tallarico coming on his show

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Next week

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
From television, yeah

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
So, when are we going to be starting the show?

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Like, 8 o'clock at night?

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Do we get a show next week, Bobby?

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Have we been bumped?

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
I don't know, no, I'm kind of

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Serious, what happens now to OLR

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Because he's not going to hold

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Himself to an hour

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
We're going to have to figure that out

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
I did see the new video that he posted

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
About the Intellivision

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
With the new game series showing off

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
And stuff like that

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
In the controller

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Showing off Missile Command, I believe

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Yeah, I saw the Missile Command video as well

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
I think they're very committed to that idea

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Which is, you know

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Some may say is the wrong idea right now

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
In the time of Coronavirus

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
But hopefully by the time this thing is out

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Coronavirus is a memory

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
God, let's hope so

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
And I think maybe more than ever

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
People will want to hang out in person again

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Because they're going to realize how much they missed it

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Because I will say

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Even though the games are not

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Packing the oomph

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
In processing power of something like

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Nintendo Switch or Playstation 4

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
What have you

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
It seems like the ideas they've committed to

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
They're executing fairly well

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Like the fact that the controller works on your phone

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
As well as the

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
You know, regular Bluetooth controller

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Like that looks like it's

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
You know, that Missile Command game they were playing

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
The foreplayer looked very fast paced

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
And it looked like it was doing very well

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
So it's kind of interesting

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Yeah, it looked pretty cool

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Yeah, so I'm looking

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Some folks in chat, OLR starting late

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
OLR cancelled next week

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Bobby says

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
I'll try to wrap it at an hour

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
We'll figure it out

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
We're just joking

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Well, here's the thing too

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Honestly, if there's any time

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
To screw with our times

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
What else do we have going on

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
The nice thing is

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Loki and Dark Sakura aren't driving

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
To get here at a certain time

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
So if we do end up with a 6.30 start time

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
It's not the end of the world

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
We'll talk about it offline

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
But I'm excited for you

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
That'll be a fun interview

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Alright, let's move on

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Loki, you have another piece of news for us

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Yes, so

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
As we were kind of alluding to earlier

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
With all the sports

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Being kind of

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Postponed right now

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
So NASCAR is another thing

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
That's now going to be

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Kind of like an eSports coverage

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
So they're gonna

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Do their first NASCAR

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
They had their first NASCAR

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Virtual race over the weekend

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
And now I guess

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Fox and NASCAR have decided

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
That they're gonna broadcast a whole season

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Of it on TV

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
And this is kind of similar to I guess

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
What Formula One's been doing

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
We talked about that last week

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
So it's gonna be the E-Nascar iRacing Pro

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Invitation Series event

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Interesting

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
I mean, like I said

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
This is kind of neat that

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
eSports is kind of gonna be a thing

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
That's coming more mainstream

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
With different sporting

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Events going to

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Their kind of electronic equivalents

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
It's also fascinating to me that you have

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
The professional sports players for being able to

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Do the physical sports that are kind of

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Transitioning to the eSports side of things

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
When it comes to these, you know, very

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Intense simulators like iRacing

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
You know, because that's supposed to really

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Simulate the kind of NASCAR experience

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Versus the other kind of

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Traditional eSports athlete that learned

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
To play said game

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Because maybe it's not based on some

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Well, even, I would say even something like Madden

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Falls into this category

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Madden is based off a sport in the real world

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
And some might even call it a simulation

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
But it doesn't really

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Play like it, if that makes sense

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
You know, like they're very, very different

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Whereas I think when we talk about something like

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
The iRacer, there's probably a lot

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
That goes into it

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
I'm not familiar with it myself, but I imagine

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
It's like the Microsoft Flight Simulator

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Of car racing where every, you know, nut and bolt

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Is kind of represented there

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
You know what I mean, whereas in Madden, it's kind of

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Has to be dumbed down

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
And I'm using my quotey fingers, I'm not saying that

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
In a negative way

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
For a controller, you know

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
And the fact that you're not

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Exerting physically in the same way

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
If that makes sense, so

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
But yeah, Bobby Blackwell says iRacing is what

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
The drivers use to train when they can't get on a track

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat over at

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Twitch TV slash VOG Network says

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
The NHL is simming the rest of their

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Season, I almost said slimming, but it's

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Simming the rest of their season

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
In NHL 20, complete with

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Players of the day and stat updates

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
The team Twitter accounts are getting into it as well

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
What else can you do

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Because, you know, when you don't

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Have games, you don't

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Have the visibility

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
You don't have the shirts

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
And the merchandising and that stuff

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Necessarily selling at the same pace

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
I'm sure there's always going to be diehard fans

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
That are looking for that stuff, but it's not going to be selling at the same pace

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
So it's like anything that you can do

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
To get people to be like, hey, remember

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Hockey, like, it's

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Going to be something they're going to try

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
So, be interesting

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
It's just, it is

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Going to be so fascinating, the

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Economic ripple that this is all

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Going to have, and I'm not trying to say it in like

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
A doom and gloom type of way

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
But I mean, look at

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Like Disney parks being shut down

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
For six weeks, that's

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Which is what we're looking at at this point

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
I haven't officially said the reopening date

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
But that's like crazy and unheard of, right?

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
So like Disney

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Disney's going to lose like six weeks

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Of park income, do you know how much money that is?

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
That's a lot of money

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
It's a lot of fucking money

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Now a company like Disney has multiple

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
TV networks, movie studios and other things

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
To kind of like keep them afloat

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
So I'm not worried like, oh my god, Disney's going to go under

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
But it's going to be like a rough transition

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
I think for a lot of companies

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Anyway, I don't want to burden us too much

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
With the real world stuff, but I would just say

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
When we get back to the real world

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
When it's safe to do so

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
It's going to be like driving on a road

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
That hasn't been paved in a little while

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
You'll get to the destination

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
It's going to be a little bumpy

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
There's going to be some potholes

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
It'll be interesting

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Yeah, Act Efton Chat says

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
We're not talking millions, we're talking billions

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Yeah, that's true, that is very true

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
As Joe and Hunter Matt points out at six weeks

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
For domestic parks, some of the international parks

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Have been closed for months now

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
So, we shall see

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Alright, anyhow

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Well, one interesting

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Case of gaming worlds

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Hopefully reflecting

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
What might happen in the real world

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Is that right now

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
House evictions are being halted

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
In Final Fantasy XIV

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
And I play a lot of Final Fantasy XIV

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
So let me kind of tell you what this really means

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Because player housing is very highly contested

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
In Final Fantasy XIV

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Because there's only so much of it

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
It's kind of a problem that's been facing the game

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
For a long time

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
There's a lot

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
There's the different areas

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
And then there's so many housing wards and plots

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
In every area

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
But it can be hard to get a house

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Sometimes you have to just kind of camp out

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
And hope that a plot becomes available

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
And try to snatch that up as soon as you can

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Because what happens in the way that plots become available

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Is that if somebody doesn't log into their account

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Or doesn't visit their house

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
I believe it's in 45 days

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
I think there's a timer that starts after 30 days

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
And if you go like another 15

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Your house is basically demolished

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
And your plot goes up for sale

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Because you basically abandon it

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
You get some of your investment back

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
And any furniture you put in there

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
You can go talk to an NPC and get it back

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
But you've essentially lost your claim to the land

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
So you get bounced for not having visited it

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
And so the housing is

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
And somebody will be there trying to buy it

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
When that happens

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
So I finally got my house

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Because I went to a new server

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
And I finally bought my house

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Because somebody abandoned the land

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
And I just happened to be in the right place

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Right time and I got the house

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Well, because not everybody is able to conduct their lives

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
With the same pattern that maybe they were before

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Not everybody is necessarily logging into Final Fantasy 14

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
With the same, you know

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
And especially probably people

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
That are working on the front lines

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
In places like healthcare and so forth

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Probably aren't thinking about things like Final Fantasy 14

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
That they used to

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
So, the automatic demolishing system has been suspended

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
So, and they've said

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
In a statement from Square Enix

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Quote, taking into account the worldwide spread

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Of COVID-19 and the economical effects

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Of various cities going into lockdown

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
We've decided to temporarily

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Suspend automatic housing demolition

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Now that I'm saying this out loud

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
This could also very much be

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
For the sake of other countries

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Maybe not so much the US

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
But other places where cafes

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
And that kind of pay in advance game time

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Is like how you play it

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
We have to remember in the US culture

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Playing at home and that stuff

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Is very much how you do it

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
But there's other cultures where Final Fantasy 14 exists

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Where you go to an internet cafe

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
To play and log into your character

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
And all that stuff

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
So I would bet for the sake of those places

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
That's why this is being

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
You know, and it's kind of one of those

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
It's easier to push the button for everybody

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Than it is for just some places

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
So there you go

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
No more evictions in Final Fantasy 14

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Until this is figured out

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
So hopefully something that reflects

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
The real world because I know there's a lot of people

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
And I'm thinking of a lot of friends of mine

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Who have been displaced from work

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
I'm sure there's many of you out there listening

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Because of what's going on in the real world

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:02.000
And I'm glad to hear

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
They're doing things like

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Unemployment benefits

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Like the stimulus package and so forth

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
I think we know

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
It's just the first of many things

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
That need to be done

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
So that we don't have just this complete

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Catastrophe of people not being

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Because where are all these people gonna go

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
So hopefully the government

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Is able to

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Put a stop to people

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Unnecessarily getting kicked out of

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Their places

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
So we'll see what develops

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Over the next few weeks and months

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Alright, well Loki we have a few more stories

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Before we wrap up the show. Loki, you first

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
So

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Capcom has decided to cancel

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Their Capcom Pro Tour

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
At least the first half of it

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Due to the COVID-19

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Pandemic and they made their announcement

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Via the Capcom Fighters

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Twitter page basically saying that

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Currently the Nobel coronavirus

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
COVID-19 is projected to continue

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
For several more months or longer

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Across the world in light of this situation

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Concerning the health and wellbeing of our players

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Staff and visitors, all tournaments

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Scheduled to be held in the first half of

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
2020 Capcom Pro Tour

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Season have been removed

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
From the schedule. We apologize for any

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Inconveniences may have caused players

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Fans and tournament operators and production

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Teams. The second half of the Capcom

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Pro Tournament is scheduled to resume in

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
July, but we will continue to monitor

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
The novella coronavirus

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Situation and we'll adjust

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
The schedule and rules accordingly

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
I mean it makes sense that it was gonna

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
happen. Yeah it's just kind of another

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
One of those up just add that to the list

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Of things that are put on hold for a little bit but

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
It is the right thing to do so

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
We just you know I think now we're just all kind of

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Wondering like when's where's that

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Line gonna be of things that get

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Canceled and things that don't get cancelled like when

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
You know the government is

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Talking about April 30th maybe

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
We can start to relax some social

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Maybe maybe

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Does that mean we're gonna be able to have conventions

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Again I don't know if it necessarily means

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
That we might start to see what probably

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Will happen is that maybe they'll still like

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Allow you to go to restaurants and things but they're

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Still gonna say to limit gatherings to a certain

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Amount of people like you know what I mean and then maybe

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Like May or June we start to

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
See some of that come back as the line gets flattened

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Even more hopefully so

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Yeah I think it's gonna happen is they're gonna

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Basically kind of scale it back

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Kind of like how we saw it progressively

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Get more restricted it's

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Gonna kind of go the opposite direction

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
SSU 100 Matt points out

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
The Olympics was the big one that being shut

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Down since a huge presidents yeah and that is not

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
An easy thing to move and you know and I think

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
I think I mentioned this last week when we heard about

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
This Olympics getting pushed back

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Thing was kind of starting this puts that

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Mario and Sonic at the 2020

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Tokyo games that game that

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Puts up in a very interesting predicament of

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Being a licensed property

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
For something that didn't happen

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
That's not necessarily true

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Because it will happen

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
But it's specifically

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
It's not called the Tokyo games

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
It's called the 2020 Olympic games

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
So yes yes it's fine

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
You all want to get me on a technicality

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Well it will happen in 2021 yes I understand that

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
But the game is still the 2020

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Another game they can make a second game

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
So what I was gonna say is

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
I mean it's not the most ridiculous

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Property that's been created

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Or no tie in

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
You may remember there was a Spy

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Hunter game that's starring

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Vin Diesel that came out

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Or I think it was Vin Diesel

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Somebody some action star that came out

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
And then the Spy Hunter movie never came out

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Oh right

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Yeah I remember they were working on a Spy Hunter movie

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
And then they just kind of stopped doing that

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Now Bobby is saying that the branding is still all gonna be

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Tokyo 2020

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Well that is gonna be interesting alright then I guess maybe it doesn't make that game

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
As special as I thought but

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
If all the branding Oh yes thank you

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
It's The Rock I knew it was one of them

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
But The Rock was

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
One of those Fast and Furious

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Guys one of them

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
One of them was in it

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Well Vin Diesel had the other one too

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
There was another one though with Vin Diesel

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
It was

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
I don't remember what it was about

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
But it was another car driving

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Type game not like

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Fast and the Furious or something but there was another

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Spy thing with cars

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
That he was in as well

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Tiger Claw says The Wheelman

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Yes that is thank you

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
That was also supposed to be a movie

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Alright

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Well moving on and after this story

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
We're gonna take your questions

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
And comments from our chat room

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
As we move into the listener round table

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
So if you have any questions or things you want us to bring up

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
That we haven't gotten to yet

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Maybe we'll hit on in a last minute story

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
But twitch.tv slash vog network

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Or vog network is the place to leave some comments

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Meanwhile

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
We have news of a Nier

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Remaster coming out

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
So Nier is hitting its 10 year anniversary

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
And there's going to be a

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Remaster Nier Replicant

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
That's coming out for the PC, Playstation 4

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
And Xbox One

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Now originally Nier Replicant

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Was on Japan on the Playstation 3

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
But in the West it was called

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Nier Gestalt

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Which then came to Japan on the Xbox 360

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
There were different

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Protagonists in the games

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
But if you have a game and I know I have this game

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
On the Xbox 360 that's just called

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Nier, it's that, but with a different

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Protagonist

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
So essentially it's a remake of that older Nier game

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
That was that, it's just some

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Little changes there

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
But I know a lot of people are pretty excited about that

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
So it's coming out for Playstation 4, Xbox One

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
And Steam

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Just in time for the 10 year anniversary

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
I'm a little surprised they're doing this

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
And not an all new Nier game

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
But maybe

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
It's one of those things where a new Nier game

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Is going to take a little time

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Again, this is coming out on Playstation 4 and Xbox One

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Maybe a new Nier game is something

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
They're plotting for Playstation 5

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
And Xbox Series X

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
And so it's going to take them a little more time to cook that up

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
So, understandable

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Fifth Dream Today says

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Best Music

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Yeah, the

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Raid in Final Fantasy that's based off Nier

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Has some pretty amazing music in it

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
I gotta say, it's really cool

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Act Deft also points out

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Nier Automata is coming to Xbox Game Pass

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
On April 2nd

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Yay, I'll finally get around to playing it

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
After all this time

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
So, I will make it a point to check that out

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
I've heard nothing but great things about the Nier games

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
So I need to check that out for sure

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
So, alright

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Well, we're going to open up the listener round table

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
If you guys have any comments or questions

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Or so forth

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Act Deft in our chat says

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Rob, the Mario and Sonic game is still special

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Because it has Waluigi doing gymnastics

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
That is true

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Waluigi participating in those events

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Is always going to be a special thing

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Shehulk10 with a question for us

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Do you guys have any

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Old games that you liked

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
But not really that popular

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
That you would like to be given

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
A current gen remake

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Or makeover

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Mine is Jaws the Revenge from 2006

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Where you play as the

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Shark

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Oh my god, I forgot about that one

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Do you remember that game? The Jaws but you're the shark

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
I thought they had one that was just like that

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Not too long ago

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
It's another Jaws game

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
I think it's Jaws

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Man Eater

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Yes, it looks

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
There's a lot similar there

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
It's not out yet

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
But that is something that's coming

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
So that's a good one

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
One that we bring up a lot on this program

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Is the Guardian Legend

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Which is honestly one of the greatest

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
8-bit games on the Nintendo

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
It was kind of a hybrid of a shooter and Legend of Zelda

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
And if you've never played the game

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
I really urge you to go check out some YouTubes

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Unfortunately I think it's one of those

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Who owns the rights now

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
That we probably are not going to see this game

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
On Virtual Console or anything like that anytime soon

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Although I would be so giddy if we ever did

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
But I would love to see

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
That come back

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
But it has to be the right studio

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
That does it

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
And I would really want to see a company like WayForward

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Because weren't they the ones behind the Blaster Master Zero?

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Yes

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Because that was done right

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
That Blaster Master relaunched it

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
And they even had the sequel as well

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Which was kind of like a sequel that didn't really exist

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Which is kind of awesome

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
That I would want to see come back

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
But it needs to be like

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
As good as Blaster Master Zero was

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
I would be very sad

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
If it was kind of crap

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Like they kind of

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Like that other Blaster Master game

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
That was on the Wii

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Which was not that great because they tried to like redo too much

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
And then the physics felt off

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
And it kind of ruined the game

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
BobbyBlackWolfe points out WayForward

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Also did DuckTales Remastered

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Which was also very well done

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Very good point

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Some other folks in chat are answering this question

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
BobbyBlackWolfe says

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
GuttaruMan

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Very good answer

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
ActDeft an old game I would love to see get a remake or make over

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Uniracers

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Repcycled in chat says

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
StuntRaceFX

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Which I'm sure is going to lead to the inevitable

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Loki answer of ExciteBike

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
ExciteTruck

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
ExciteTruck get it right

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Sorry my bad

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
We've seen ExciteBike get remastered a few times

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
But not ExciteTruck yet

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
Yes I'm all for that

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
I'm all for an ExciteTruck

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Yeah

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Repcycled saying StuntRaceFX

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
In a way I feel like ExciteTruck

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Was a StuntRaceFX

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
A little bit

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
A little bit I don't know

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
So those are some answers there

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Loki any last minute stories

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
While we wait and see if chat has any other questions

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Or comments for us

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Yes I do have one so

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Apparently there was a push notification

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
That went out

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Just tonight saying that

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
HQ Trivia is back

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Apparently

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
I think that was the trivia game that you can actually

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Win real money

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
That thing was like all the rage

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
For like a month and then everybody quit

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Yeah and if you saw their last episode

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
It was great go look it up on YouTube

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Because they were drunk and they didn't

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Give a fuck

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
They were swearing and doing all this stuff

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
They were probably high

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
They were just like we're closing tonight

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Whatever it's the last one

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
And the guy put up a prize of $5

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Of his own money

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
It was great

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
It was like total

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
They're coming back tonight

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
So

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Alright cool I guess

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
You know maybe it's one of those things

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Where it's like now is the time for that

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Maybe they see an opportunity where it's like

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Everybody's stuck at home

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Let's try this again

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
They must have had a financier step in

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
And be like now's the time

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
An anonymous investor

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
That's what it is

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
ActDeft in chat

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Says question for Robin Loki

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Have you seen that Twitter tag meme

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
To post four games that defined you

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Well what are yours

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
I have seen that meme

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
I just held off on doing it

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Because I don't like tag memes

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Because then it's like I have to tag people

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
That probably won't do it and then it's like

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Why don't you tag me

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
That's basically an email for no thanks

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
There's a lot about those memes I don't really like

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
But let's take the

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Because the question is still good

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
So let's take the question out of that

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Four games that define you

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
This is tricky

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
I'd have to really think on this

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
But in the moment I'm gonna say

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
One of the obvious answers is Dance Dance Revolution

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Without that game I wouldn't know Loki

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
I wouldn't know any of you

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Because I wouldn't have had this show

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
So that's at the top of the list

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Other games

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
So I'm gonna try to let that be the music game representation

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
I would say the original Legend of Zelda

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
On the NES

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Just because that was the game

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
That really turned me into a video game nerd

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Because that was the one where other kids

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Who used to bully me would then

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Secretly want to ask me questions about

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
So how do I get to the fourth dungeon in the second quest

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Yeah right stuff like that

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
So I would say that game was very definitive

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Two more

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Because of the

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
Because of the

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Fucking crazy amount of that I played in college

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
I think that's really all I need to say about that one

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
And that was kind of like the PlayStation

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
I almost said Final Fantasy 7

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
But then I was like no you know what PlayStation game got even more time

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Was Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
And then a fourth game

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Probably some sort of MMO

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
Maybe I will say

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Final Fantasy 11

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Again I'm not really giving this a lot of thought

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
I'm kind of answering this spontaneously

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
But those are the four that come up spontaneously

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
But I feel like an MMO needs representation in there

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
I had an MMO based podcast for many years

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
And that way the Final Fantasy franchise gets represented as well

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Which I've always been a big fan of

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Alright Loki what about you

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Four games that define you

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
So I have to say

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Final Fantasy 7

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Final Fantasy 7

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
So I have to say

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Dance Man's Revolution

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
I mean probably the whole series

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Because they can't really

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
I guess fourth mix if we had to pick

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
A game

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
Third mix plus Korean

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Is mine

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Okay

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
And then I would say

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Grand Theft Auto 4

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Because I played a ton of that

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Let's see

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
I would probably have to say

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Final Fantasy 11

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
And

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Yeah probably The Legend of Zelda

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Because that was one of the first Nintendo games I got

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Driver 3

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
I didn't play enough Driver 3

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Saints Row

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Okay yeah I did play a ton of Saints Row

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
She-Hulk 10

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
I like this answer

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Pac-Man Asteroids

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Halo Mass Effect

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
I'm really surprised I didn't put

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Mass Effect the trilogy on my list

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
See that's a my bad for not thinking

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
That through further but

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
You know I think I don't know if I would say

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Mass Effect defined me

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
As much as

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
I really fucking liked

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Mass Effect

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Because I kind of feel like there's a difference

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
You know what I mean

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
I'm not critical of how anybody else

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Wants to answer this question I'm just saying when I answered it

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Things that I'm thinking of are like

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Like this podcast

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
And the many many many hours

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Would not exist if not for DDR and so on

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Kind of the different reasons I gave

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
But like as far as like

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Things I really enjoyed I would really have to

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Probably put Mass Effect on that list

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
As well so

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Really good question I like that I guess that's a good one

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
To end on so any other last minute stories

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Loki before we wrap up

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Yeah so

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Couple more

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
I talked about GameStop closing 300

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Stores so it's actually about 320

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Stores in 2020

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
This was due to their 2019

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Investors call

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Apparently they're saying we're continuing to

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Focus optimizing our global

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Store fleet in fiscal 2019

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
And closing that total

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Of 321

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Stores inclusive of

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
333 closings and 12

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Openings and in fiscal

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
2020 we will continue our efforts

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
To de-densify the store

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Base and focus on

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Maximizing product

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Productivity of the entire fleet

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
So

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
I mean this was as of a call

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Last week

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
So who knows the toll that

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Other real world stuff might take on this

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
But they were already planning to close 300

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
They were already doing that like I already

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Like I said my local store is

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Closing I know that he

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
The guys there were

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Promising me some stuff but I know

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
That they haven't been in the store for

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
You know a week or so

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
So I don't even know what that's doing

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
To their closing because they were

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Doing like closeout stuff but they still have a ton

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Of product in the store and

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
I mean if they're not open I don't know what that does

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
For them if they're just going to postpone the closure

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Of them until they can open again

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Or what the case may be

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
I was thinking

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Going back on that four games question and I can't

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Believe I didn't fucking say Ingress

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Just because of like

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
I've traveled to cities I wouldn't have gone to

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Otherwise if it wasn't for that game

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Yeah so there's

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
I have to really sit down and think about that one

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Long and hard there's a lot of good answers

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
For that I think so

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Anyway

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Because somebody else said Pokemon

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
It made me think Pokemon Go and then I was like oh yeah

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Ingress I should have said Ingress because I've been playing that way too long

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Maybe Ingress

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Just slipped my mind because I haven't been playing

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
It the past couple weeks I wonder what

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
I mean a little

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Bit like when I walked

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
30 minutes to another

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Park I played it at the park

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
And then walked back but that's like it

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Like I'm not playing it nearly

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
At the level I was playing it before

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
So interesting

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Yeah SG100Matt says Rob didn't say

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Super Metroid either

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
No I didn't because again

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
The question was the games that defined you

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Not which games do you really really really really like

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
I think there's a difference

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
You know it really is

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Anyway

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
So that's it for last minute stories Logie

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
I was going to say there's one more

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
It's kind of silly

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
So Crash Nitro

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
Field Racing

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Or Crash Team Racing Nitro Field

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
They had a funny

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
April Fools

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Day

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
DLC that they're putting out

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
So apparently it's free

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Which is good and so what happens

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Is if you smash some of these

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Benox crates scattered throughout the tracks

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
You can actually

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Unlock a hidden crate

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Cart

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
So the hidden

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
It's like a

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
A benox crate

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Is the driver of the cart

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
One of the smashing crates

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
From Crash Team

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Huh interesting

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
That's a little silly

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
I kind of like though that they

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Are doing an April Fools

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Something along those lines because I think a lot of us

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Are going to be really tired of April Fools

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Day this year for all intents and purposes

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
April Fools Day is cancelled

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Just don't

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
April Fools Day? Don't

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Not this year, not today Satan

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
There's too much other stuff going on in the room

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
But I think cute things

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Like this

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Ready for it

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Extra things, sideshow, okay

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Okay we can do that

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
But that's about all we can tolerate right now

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
No jokes

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Anyhow

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Alright I think with that we will go ahead and wrap things up

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
I know it's a little bit shorter of a show

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
But we didn't have Jamie tonight

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
We're on Discord so I think things will be a little bit

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Shorter just in the interim

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
We still filled a good about two hours or so

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Nonetheless

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Almost two hours

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
We want to thank you guys for being here and tuning in this week

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Whether it was live on Sunday night

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Over the Voice Geeks Network Twitch channel

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Or if it was on the podcast feed

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Really appreciate that

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Songs Radio

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
But the more voices we get here on Sunday nights

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
And on our podcast feed

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Throughout the week sending us tweets and things like that

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
The more we can get your voices out there

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
So tell a friend or two about the show

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Help us spread the word

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Auto hosts on your Twitch channel go a long way

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Please consider adding VOG Network to your host list

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
That would be super awesome

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
And then just you know sharing on social media

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
The Spotify link or things like that whatever

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Those things come in very very very very handy

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Really appreciate those of you guys that do that

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
That's going to do it for this week

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
We'll be back in seven days to talk all again

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
And hopefully Dar Sacro will be back with us

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
And can talk about other stuff

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
We'll probably still be remote via Discord

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
For a little while but that's okay

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
We'll talk about whatever's going on in gaming

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Loki I guess we get to final thoughts

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Any final thoughts from you tonight?

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Yes I've been staring at a black widow

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
That's been in my

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
My

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
monitor arms

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
And it's just

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
It's crawled up inside there now

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
And now I have to somehow take this apart

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
And go kill it

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
I think you're going to be burning your house down later

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Honestly and I

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
That's the reason to do it

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
So

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
And then my final thoughts

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Tonight is

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Just keep staying inside

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
If I can do it you can do it

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
And enjoy the games

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Catch up on your backlog

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
You'll have some near on Xbox Game Pass this week

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
You've got plenty of other free games out there

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
And stuff in your backlog

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
So check it all out this week

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Have fun and we'll see you

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
On Twitch and on the podcast feed

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
In seven more days

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Have a great week everybody

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
