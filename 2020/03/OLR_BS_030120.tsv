0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	27000	There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki!
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	42000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, not live tonight for a special bonus stage episode,
42000	48000	but this is the episode that will be airing at our Twitch channel on March the 1st of 2020.
48000	51000	So happy March! We're kind of fast-forwarding in time.
51000	56000	We're doing the time warp again with myself, Rob Roberts, and over there, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
56000	60000	Hi. Hi, how are you? My brain is pulp.
60000	65000	I know, we all had to work today. Usually when we do this show, we don't have to work, like, earlier in the day, but today we had to work.
65000	70000	I'm in the middle of training. Oh, fun! That's my job. Sort of.
70000	75000	It's so funny that, like, because I normally work 4x10, and I'm working 5x8 this week,
75000	79000	I'm only three days in, and I'm more tired than I would have been on a normal work day.
79000	83000	I'm hoping at some point I can switch my schedule to 4x10, because that's a thing we're allowed to do,
83000	87000	but just, you know, it hasn't logistically made sense yet.
87000	91000	But I at least wore my death metal shirt today, which was awesome.
91000	95000	Awesome. Alright, and also say hello to TechMasterLoki. Hello.
95000	99000	Who's dressed up in a little button-down shirt like me? I have a gamer shirt under it.
99000	104000	I do that too. I wear a lot of gamer shirts, except I don't remember what I have on today.
104000	109000	I think it's just a plain one, but a lot of times I wear gamer t-shirts and stuff underneath.
110000	114000	Okay, there you go. So we're all, I know you can't see it unless you're on our Twitch channel.
114000	119000	You just happen to be there Sunday night, because we do usually tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific,
119000	125000	9 o'clock Eastern, right after Bobby Black Wolf at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vognetwork,
125000	131000	also available at vognetwork.com. Our next live show, we will return on March 15th.
131000	136000	But I, how dare I, I booked a cruise, as I've been saying on the show for the past few weeks,
136000	142000	so I'm going to be gone for a little bit. And I think, Jamie, you said you're going to a sister's thing one of these nights as well, right?
142000	146000	I thought that was a thing. Maybe I made that up. No, that's in April. Okay, well.
146000	152000	But I might be going to a GDC after party. Well, there you go. Oh, so GDC is still happening.
152000	156000	I've been hearing in the news this week that more and more companies are back. I think it's more stats.
156000	159000	I'm just going to go to the parties, but it's a Sony party, so I don't know if that got cancelled.
159000	165000	But I got a confirmation about it today. It's like the LGBT inclusion party.
165000	171000	Cool. And no, it's sponsored by Microsoft. Never mind. But that's that's quite the mix up, my friend.
171000	178000	I can't brain. I have the Lurgy. It was the it was the Nintendo PlayStation box.
178000	183000	I used up all my logic, learning logic. It's fine. It's fine. Anyway, where was I?
183000	190000	I went on a tangent. I was talking about how Loki and I kind of look different on the feed today just because we're kind of we're doing this right after work.
190000	194000	So it's like any different. Well, no, because you're the voice. You're the voice off camera.
194000	199000	You're the mystery. But I'm actually not wearing anything different than what I would normally wear anyway, because my work doesn't have a dress code.
199000	204000	Yeah, you're you're well, we OK. We legit do not have a dress.
204000	208000	It says in our H.R. that there is no dress code.
208000	213000	Well, the dress code where I'm at is basically make good choices. But here's what it's really about.
213000	219000	I'm wearing slightly nicer clothes because I can't wear anything that is going to go on the cruise with us.
219000	224000	So like my jeans, I can't wear. So I have to wear like the nice because we're not going to the tropics.
224000	229000	I'm not bringing this as much as I like this button up. Sure. It's one of my favorites. Not taking this all the way to the Bahamas.
229000	236000	So I'm kind of wearing these clothes now because the other ones are starting to where we're actually packing, not the night before.
236000	241000	I'm very proud of Alan and I. We've already started the packing process. So, yeah.
241000	245000	So some of my clothes are already packed, basically. So otherwise I would wear like jeans or something more.
245000	250000	I think I owe exactly three button ups and two of them are flannel. But you got one on now is a flannel.
250000	254000	Yeah, that's good. All right. Anyway, enough about fashion.
254000	261000	Let's talk about video games because we are going to talk about some of the things that have happened so far in this week.
261000	268000	We're about halfway through the week when we're taping this show. But again, this show is going to air on Twitch on March 1st.
268000	274000	So some big things may have happened, but it may not have happened yet at the night we're taping this.
274000	281000	So if we missed a headline or two, we'll catch up on all the big stories when we return live on March 15th over on Twitch.
281000	288000	But for now, let's talk about one of the bigger stories that's happened so far this week and it has to do with Xbox Series X, a Microsoft story.
288000	293000	Microsoft actually put out a new blog post that's teasing some more features.
293000	298000	It's starting to tease a little more about what's really inside it and so forth.
298000	306000	So for example, I think this is actually a new confirmation, 12 teraflops of GPU performance.
306000	310000	Of course, I have no idea. How does one measure a teraflop?
310000	311000	I don't know.
311000	315000	Five hundred thirty-five thousand floppy minutes? I don't know.
315000	320000	It's a processor. It's how fast it processes information, but I don't know.
320000	322000	You said you saw some post earlier.
322000	329000	There was someone that was posting something saying it was about as powerful as 165 Gamecubes or something like that.
329000	333000	And they had like a picture, like a graphic of Gamecubes taped together.
333000	338000	But it still wasn't as powerful as it. It was like close. It was like twelve something.
338000	345000	So you can maybe run 164 different windows with Smash Brothers Melee on it, but not 165.
345000	346000	That's too many.
346000	350000	165 Gamecubes, that's like the size of the original Xbox.
351000	355000	So they are saying four times more powerful than the Xbox One.
355000	360000	And it's got some pretty nice specs in it.
360000	368000	Yeah, NVMe SSD, which we kind of knew about the SSD already, which is going to help speed up load times.
368000	372000	Although I'm also hearing that the SSD, because I was seeing a different story,
372000	380000	kind of a somewhat unrelated story about how Sony is struggling with cost issues on the PlayStation 5.
380000	385000	Now obviously nothing's confirmed. This is all like rumor stuff from investor forecasters and things like that.
385000	390000	But apparently the SSD supply issue is something that's coming into question.
390000	399000	And I don't know if that's related to COVID or if that's because of just certain technological parts kind of go in and out of demand.
399000	402000	Like remember when everybody was buying up the graphic cards for fucking Bitcoin?
402000	405000	Yeah, all that stuff. So I don't know if the SSD is something like that.
405000	406000	They're popular.
406000	413000	Yeah, perhaps. But anyway, so Xbox Series X is planning to have the NVMe SSD.
413000	424000	Now what also was very interesting and probably one of the highlights of the post that people were spreading around was their technology, if you want, called Smart Delivery.
424000	425000	That's how they're branding it.
425000	434000	And so Smart Delivery is you buy the game once and you play the best version possible either on the Series X or the Xbox One.
434000	441000	So for example, Halo Infinite. Let's say you're not ready to buy Xbox Series X because maybe it's going to be an expensive console.
441000	451000	And usually, especially when this last generation of games wasn't readily backwards compatible, Xbox One got there eventually.
451000	457000	But remember it launched when Phil Spencer wasn't CEO. It launched without backwards compatibility and it never came to PlayStation 4.
457000	463000	So right now there's a lot of mindset out there that if you buy a console, you don't get to play your old games again.
463000	466000	Or, well, I'm going to wait and just buy this on a new console.
466000	476000	It's kind of going to be changing the way of thinking because now if I'm not ready to buy the Xbox Series X yet, but I buy Halo Infinite now for my Xbox One,
476000	483000	I'll be able to play it on Xbox Series X. Not only just play the same version, but play the enhanced version.
483000	486000	Yeah, I've got to wonder if that's going to go away at some point.
486000	493000	I don't think so because honestly, this is how it kind of should work because that's how PCs.
493000	498000	This has been a strong argument in favor of PCs. You upgrade your graphics card and your game plays better.
498000	507000	But eventually, game performance, like PCs, eventually that lower end keeps going up and up and up.
507000	512000	I see, so eventually the game can't really be made for Xbox One anymore.
512000	513000	Yes.
513000	518000	Well, I wonder if that's where they're going to start, and they haven't said this yet, but I wonder if that's where they're going to start relying on cloud.
518000	522000	So this game doesn't run on the Xbox One, but we'll run it through the cloud.
522000	523000	Maybe.
523000	526000	And I wonder if that's the ultimate answer we end up with for Microsoft.
526000	528000	Maybe by the time we get to that point, you know.
528000	535000	Smart, they are also saying it's not necessarily going to be for every title. They can only really guarantee it for their titles.
535000	544000	So the company says Smart Delivery will be standard for Xbox Game Studio titles, and it'll be available for third party developers to implement.
544000	550000	I believe Cyberpunk has already come out and said they will be one of those games that supports the Smart Delivery.
550000	553000	So some third parties are already getting on this, but it's not guaranteed.
553000	557000	And I especially imagine in the indie universe it might be a little trickier.
557000	559000	You know, I don't know how...
559000	566000	Well, and also some of those might not necessarily be making an enhanced version as well, so it might be easier for them, who knows.
566000	567000	Very true.
567000	576000	Some other features they're talking about with Xbox Series X, they want to do a quick resume capability, which will let you jump back into multiple titles from where you left off.
576000	580000	Now you can kind of do this right now on Xbox One and PlayStation 4, they're kind of the same.
580000	581000	And Switch.
581000	583000	Oh yeah, and Switch, right?
583000	591000	Well, where my brain goes on PlayStation 4 is it's really good with multitasking one game and a TV service.
591000	595000	So for example, I've been mentioning on the show the past couple of weeks I've been playing a lot of No Man's Sky, right?
595000	605000	Well, what I might do is when I'm sick of playing No Man's Sky and I just want to veg on the couch and surf my phone, maybe I'll switch to Twitch and I'll watch one of my streamer buddies on Twitch.
605000	615000	Well, then when I go back to No Man's Sky, I pick up right where I left off. It picks up the suspend, so it doesn't have to reload my save file, because the save files take a long time to load in that game.
615000	619000	So I go right back to where I left off, which is kind of nice.
619000	629000	So imagine you could do that, but with multiple games. Like you have your Halo is suspended here, your Cyberpunk is suspended here, Ori is suspended here, you can kind of go back and forth.
629000	631000	That's kind of neat.
631000	640000	I don't think it's a game changer, but it's kind of one of those, again, well, when you minimize a window in Windows or Mac, whatever, but I say Windows because Microsoft does Windows.
640000	642000	I see more and more cross.
642000	650000	I mean, I just hope it works better than loading multiple games at one time because that usually tanks performance because you have multiple games running at the same time.
650000	651000	True, very true.
651000	660000	But, I mean, it's not a deal breaker if it didn't work like that. My expectation is as long as it works like it does now, then that's fine.
660000	672000	And then one other thing that they talked about in the blog post is Dynamic Latency Input, or DLI, inside the wireless controller to reduce the delay between the buttons you're pressing and what appears on the screen.
672000	684000	So what they're trying to do is basically make the connection between the Bluetooth controller that you use and the TV instantaneous, basically, which I don't feel like it's really been a problem.
684000	688000	You can play music games on wireless controllers and it's fine.
688000	692000	You might have to adjust the timing or whatever, but it's usually pretty good.
692000	697000	So I wonder if they are trying to narrow that down, though, to help with the cloud.
697000	702000	I imagine it's not something that's going to be as noticeable in your living room as it will be for the cloud.
702000	709000	Because, again, in my limited use of Google Stadia, although I've played a few things, it finally ran out.
709000	712000	So I don't have Google Stadia Pro anymore. It ran out, right?
712000	719000	I didn't re-up it for three more months, which, by the way, you're automatically subscribed when you sign up for it.
719000	725000	So turn it off. You don't have to talk to anybody or call anybody. You just have to go in and turn it off, or it's going to re-sub.
725000	729000	And it might have already done that for you. Just check, unless you want to keep it.
729000	735000	But anyway, with Stadia, I've played things like Thumper, which is kind of a music horror game, I believe they describe it as, right?
735000	742000	It plays fine, which is the most impressive part of Stadia's technology in many ways, is that there really is an input lag.
742000	750000	So I wonder if this is kind of part of that as well. So it's neat, and it sounds like a cool direction for Microsoft.
750000	760000	And that's really all I have to say about these updates. But what I think is also notable about all of this is that it's keeping Microsoft's name out there.
760000	767000	It's getting the blog posts written about them and so forth. And on the other side, Sony, still kind of a question mark.
767000	773000	Which I don't think is the end of the world. I really feel like we were doing the same song and dance.
773000	775000	Who wants to do a song and dance?
775000	777000	That's a very different show.
777000	778000	Some people are into that.
778000	782000	Stay tuned. Late nights at ball game work. Just kidding. We don't want to get banned from Twitch.
782000	788000	But the same old song and dance when it was the Nintendo Switch, because I'm almost positive.
788000	792000	We were like, when's Nintendo going to show it? When are they going to fucking show it?
792000	798000	Like, are they ever going to announce this goddamn thing? And then they finally did, like, six weeks before it came out.
798000	801000	And it was, they didn't have a problem.
801000	802000	Yeah.
802000	809000	And Sony has followed in the path of Nintendo on a couple things. I would say the Nintendo Directs being one of them.
809000	816000	And changing their E3 strategy. Although we know Nintendo still does E3, they don't do conferences at E3 anymore.
816000	825000	So do you think they'll announce after Microsoft, like, especially when Microsoft announces price points and stuff, just to kind of like undercut them?
825000	831000	I do think Sony's waiting to hear the price because now this is a rumor.
831000	842000	But the rumor is that when that E3 happened all those years ago, when, you know, Sony basically punched Xbox in the kidney after, you know, their performance.
842000	846000	And undercut them by $100 and had all those videos about that.
846000	852000	The rumor is that Sony had three presentations ready to go at three different prices.
852000	859000	And they were waiting for Microsoft to reveal theirs before they revealed, because, and they, it was the night, the next day.
859000	862000	So it was like Microsoft did like Monday or whatever, and Sony was on Tuesday.
862000	868000	So once they heard Microsoft's price, they made a decision Tuesday morning, this is the price, and they went with that presentation.
868000	870000	But they had three presentations ready to go.
870000	875000	One was $100 higher and the other was $100 lower. I don't know how that would have played out, but yeah.
875000	877000	So, interesting, huh?
877000	886000	Anyway, that is a rumor, but it's one of those, if we want to, on this very special bonus episode of Orange Lawn's radio, as much as I hate what this has turned into,
886000	895000	if we want to bring back the plausibility scale for a night, the fact that Sony had three different presentations ready to go and they picked after Microsoft went,
895000	899000	I would give a mostly green light on the plausibility scale.
899000	900000	What about you?
900000	902000	Yeah. Yeah, it's plausible.
902000	909000	Yeah. And I, so the fact that maybe they're making a similar type of game of chicken, of wait and see, I think is very possible.
909000	917000	Especially because Microsoft has now committed themselves, essentially, to revealing the price and all of the details at E3.
917000	923000	Sony hasn't. And all this stuff about Sony's going to do an event in February, Sony's going to do an event in March,
923000	929000	it's either off of what Sony has done before, which I know is ironic because we literally just use the plausibility scale.
929000	933000	They could still do that and talk about the system, but not announce the price.
933000	935000	That's very true. That's very true. They could.
935000	939000	They could do something like this where they just talk about it does this and this and this.
939000	945000	And yes, it does look like a giant U-shaped, or I guess they're saying a V for five in Roman.
945000	949000	Do you think it's, that's, I mean, y'all have seen the dev kits, right?
949000	954000	They're like, I would hope it's sleeker looking than that, because that, that thing looks like ridiculous.
954000	959000	That thing looks like a beast. Just put it in, just like, it doesn't need the U-shape.
959000	964000	Just put it in a PC tower case, like make it like with LEDs and stuff on it.
964000	969000	Put a big, like, it just looks weird, but that, that's a dev kit.
969000	973000	So, you know, no, I know we shouldn't, we can't base anything off the dev kit, but you have to wonder, you have to,
974000	978000	you do have to wonder because like, why shape the dev kill? Like that's weird too.
978000	983000	Like dev kits are usually in like a PC tower case. So it's like, you know,
983000	987000	Sony could get us to shut the fuck up about this by just showing us the console,
989000	994000	but that's, that's what, that's what the next few months are going to be like until it's going to be a giant boomerang,
994000	997000	like the boomerang controller for the PlayStation three that never happened.
997000	1001000	Oh my God. Look, I forgot about those, the boomerang controller.
1001000	1003000	Those things are actually kind of cool.
1003000	1004000	The Batarang.
1004000	1006000	The Batarang. Do you remember those dark soccer? They're at that one E3.
1006000	1007000	They looked uncomfortable.
1007000	1012000	They did, but they were kind of rad. Like I was like, I could, I could fuck up the Riddler with one of these.
1013000	1014000	Yeah, probably.
1014000	1019000	That's cool. Bring hashtag, bring back the Batarang for a PlayStation five.
1019000	1022000	Although we already know it's going to be like the same damn controller, but with, you know,
1022000	1028000	it sounds like maybe the haptic feedback type of thing, which is cool. I mean, in the reality that is probably the better solution.
1029000	1034000	So, um, yeah, I, uh, it's going to be interesting to see Sony make their counter move,
1034000	1046000	but I think one thing we should all kind of be ready for is that they might not like Sony really could wait until after E3 to launch.
1047000	1051000	Well, they can't, obviously they can't go that far, but they can go up to like maybe two months before.
1051000	1056000	I don't know. Do you know this from having been on the other side, the retail, the retail distribution side of things?
1056000	1062000	I mean, I know the industry is much different from when you were in it, but like how much lead time does a big distributor need for like,
1062000	1063000	Oh, I got to put hardware on my shelf.
1063000	1065000	Oh, they don't tell us until the very end.
1065000	1066000	Okay.
1066000	1070000	Until they've already made their announcement most of the time, unless you're a big retailer.
1070000	1075000	Um, but I've like, I had conversations with this one, I don't remember like the details of it, but there,
1075000	1080000	it was all the way back to the Sega Genesis launch or maybe his master system,
1080000	1088000	but they're talking about like, he was on the product launch team for that and talking about like how they came up with the starter pack thing that they had or something like that.
1088000	1095000	And how, like literally the announcement was like a banner on the roof or something like that of, you know, Sega, but he's talking about all the craziness behind that.
1095000	1099000	So then sometimes they don't really know what the plan is going to be until they do the plan.
1099000	1105000	Um, you know, kind of going back to the three presentation theory there, but.
1106000	1112000	Yeah, like, well, you know, small distributors and you're not going to get heads up because they know that shit gonna leak.
1112000	1119000	So of course they're not telling anybody until they make the announcement, then they'll send you the details if you're lucky.
1119000	1126000	So, but so at the end of the day, if Sony send you like the skews to set it up or whatever, but that's about it.
1126000	1133000	If Sony wanted to wait till July or August to announce the console, it's not going to hurt them in the long run.
1133000	1134000	Nope.
1134000	1139000	So that's a reality we should, especially like in August, when you have, I don't know if they're going to games com still.
1139000	1144000	So, you know, games com would be a really good time for them to pull the curtain back on it.
1144000	1145000	Yeah, you're right.
1145000	1152000	They're going to, I would say, I would say games com is when you're going to get a beefy amount of information.
1152000	1153000	Yeah. Yeah.
1153000	1154000	Well, yeah.
1154000	1158000	And by then, hopefully you'll have more third parties announcing titles for the PlayStation five as well.
1158000	1161000	And we could get something at GDC.
1162000	1167000	Sony has done GDC announcements before PlayStation home. Wasn't VR.
1167000	1169000	PlayStation VR was a GDC announcement, wasn't it?
1169000	1170000	I don't remember.
1170000	1175000	They have, and usually they've been or move or one of the things was like a GDC announcement.
1175000	1178000	I would be curious about the next PlayStation VR as well.
1178000	1185000	It is possible by the time we do our next show, or even by the time people are hearing this because of GDC, they may have said some stuff.
1185000	1186000	So we'll see.
1186000	1187000	They're waiting.
1187000	1188000	And we're going to sound real stupid.
1188000	1189000	They're waiting.
1189000	1190000	They're waiting for us to go on breakthrough.
1190000	1197000	Now that's all the things do it now, now, now, now nobody listens to him, but it's still, we're going to fuck him over anyways.
1198000	1199000	I love it.
1199000	1200000	So we'll see.
1200000	1201000	Stay tuned.
1201000	1203000	Uh, but if it's, if it's a little more time, then it's a little more time.
1203000	1211000	I didn't want to mention though, like, cause usually when you have, um, consoles launch and stuff that the hardware that they put in them is kind of like current gen hardware.
1211000	1218000	But what's kind of neat though about that, our DNA, uh, GPU is that it is the brand new architecture that hasn't even launched yet.
1218000	1224000	So that's like new, new, new cutting edge, new for like the, uh, GPU, which is pretty awesome.
1224000	1225000	Huh.
1225000	1226000	That is cool.
1226000	1227000	All right.
1227000	1231000	Well, let's move on and talk about things, uh, not so new, but maybe a little new.
1231000	1233000	It's the types of games we've been playing this week.
1233000	1236000	So let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks.
1236000	1237000	Dark Sakura.
1237000	1239000	How was your gaming week so far?
1239000	1241000	Lots of ghosts and goblins.
1241000	1242000	Cool.
1242000	1250000	And then the usual cell phone stuff.
1250000	1255000	I really have been just so brain dead with all the stuff that I have going on right now.
1255000	1263000	However, I did do something kind of gaming related that maybe the listeners will hear before too long.
1263000	1264000	You can talk about it.
1264000	1265000	It's fine.
1265000	1268000	Well, I worked on a theme song for the show.
1268000	1269000	Yeah.
1269000	1274000	Well, I was supposed to be paying attention in my class today.
1274000	1280000	So there's, yeah, I've heard the draft of a Dark Sakura created theme song and it's, it's good.
1280000	1285000	Like it's, you know, it's, um, yeah, we gotta, we gotta just, you know, the timing.
1285000	1286000	Yeah.
1286000	1287000	Yeah.
1287000	1288000	I'm excited for everybody to hear it.
1288000	1289000	So stay tuned.
1289000	1290000	And then poking a couple of somebodies.
1290000	1291000	Yes.
1291000	1292000	Yes.
1292000	1296000	Obviously voiceover guy, Jason will still be here to do the voiceovers every week, but
1296000	1301000	we need a new voice for the, um, you know, it's orange lounge radio with dark Sakura,
1301000	1303000	Robert, you know, and that whole thing.
1303000	1306000	So, uh, not that we don't appreciate what MIDI had did for us.
1306000	1307000	Oh yes.
1307000	1309000	And stream him on Spotify, support him please.
1309000	1313000	He's helped us out a bunch over the years, but it's just, we've had that theme song for
1313000	1314000	over 10 years.
1314000	1319000	It's time for, and I got to play a lot in logic, which was fun.
1319000	1322000	I, the more I use it, the more I really enjoy it.
1322000	1324000	So, so we'll see.
1324000	1325000	Yep.
1325000	1326000	But that's what I was doing.
1326000	1327000	All right.
1327000	1328000	How about you, Loki?
1328000	1330000	Um, I just played more Minecraft with the kids.
1330000	1336360	So on our realm that we have, um, I went to the nether and tried to find another fortress
1336360	1342360	and I was like, okay, well I'm going to make a, you know, a portal to this nether fortress.
1342360	1346200	And then of course, every block in the nether is eight blocks in the surface.
1346200	1353680	And like, I literally walked for like five, five days in there and I still wasn't close
1353680	1358200	to where I was supposed to the actual village that we're in.
1358200	1366000	So I just gave up and killed myself so I could spawn back at the village cause I'm like,
1366000	1367000	this is taking too long.
1367000	1370880	They're like, you're never going to get back, you're just gone forever.
1370880	1378400	So it's like, well, well, I'll find another one that's closer.
1378400	1380400	So I was doing that.
1380400	1381400	All right.
1381400	1382400	That it?
1382400	1383400	Oh, an ornament.
1384120	1387640	I'm upgrading a level 10 weapon, so I have to wait three days for that stupid thing.
1387640	1388640	Oh gosh.
1388640	1389640	Wow.
1389640	1390640	I never had, it ends tonight though.
1390640	1391640	So, okay.
1391640	1393880	I was like, I don't have enough material to do past like level four or five.
1393880	1394880	So wow.
1394880	1395880	Good for you.
1395880	1396880	Yeah.
1396880	1397880	Nice.
1397880	1398880	All right.
1398880	1399880	Don't take my land though.
1399880	1401000	They need to do something like, you're right.
1401000	1406200	There's like one person who has like easily half this town.
1406200	1412160	So like they need to do something where like if he or she is not regularly going to that
1412160	1415200	place, then they need like a deterioration mechanic.
1415200	1420680	Like how an ingress portals decay, how in Pokemon go gyms, the Pokemon get weaker as
1420680	1421680	time goes on.
1421680	1422680	Right.
1422680	1423680	Yeah.
1423680	1425880	Orna really needs something like that because otherwise it's just about who claimed it the
1425880	1428200	earliest and then leveled up to level two 50.
1428200	1429200	So nobody can take them out.
1429200	1432880	Oh, eventually I'll get to that point and then it's just going to be like, game on.
1432880	1433880	It's just gone.
1433880	1434880	Take it all over.
1434880	1435880	Yeah.
1435880	1436880	It's all mine.
1436880	1438080	Declaring open war on what's her name.
1438080	1440720	So I think Mike, the two, the shadow looks females.
1440720	1441720	I don't know.
1441720	1442720	I don't know who it does.
1442720	1443720	It doesn't matter.
1443720	1444720	Damn you.
1444720	1445720	Auntie St. Mike.
1445720	1446720	Their number is up.
1446720	1447720	All right.
1447720	1448800	Well, that's not the name I was thinking of.
1448800	1452080	There's another name, like everywhere, like downtown and yeah.
1452080	1455440	So my area is auntie St. Mike and the ghost of auntie St.
1455440	1456440	Calleria or something like that.
1456440	1457440	That's the one I see everywhere.
1457440	1462480	And part of like, yeah, they have like, it's the something ornate, something of the burrito
1462480	1463480	or I don't remember.
1463480	1465560	Oh, they're a little, they're a little guilt.
1465560	1469680	And look, I'm, I I'm all for, Hey, if people are going to be aggressive and want to play
1469680	1471600	the game hard and control their territory.
1471600	1472600	That's fine.
1472600	1473600	That's what Ingress is all about.
1473600	1474600	You know?
1474600	1478600	But, uh, I just think the game shouldn't like reward somebody for just like you get really
1478600	1479600	much.
1479600	1484840	It's like you get 10 gold every day, but you can't create your own kingdom until you have
1484840	1486280	100 pieces of land.
1486280	1487680	You need a hundred reputation.
1487680	1489260	Oh yeah.
1489260	1491440	You can't create your own kingdom until you have a hundred.
1491440	1493620	Oh, I didn't know you can even make a kingdom.
1493620	1495680	So it's, it's a pain.
1495680	1496680	All right.
1496680	1497680	That it for your game week.
1497680	1498680	That's it.
1498680	1499680	That's it for this week.
1499680	1502320	So, um, I haven't played a lot cause it's still early in the week, but continuing with
1502320	1505880	Final Fantasy 14, cause I'm a nerd, got to get my tomes, kept my tomes.
1505880	1508480	Uh, and then I've been playing no man's sky still just a little bit.
1508480	1510920	I haven't been playing a lot this week, but what I did do.
1510920	1514900	So do you guys remember on the last show I mentioned that I took, I took a really great
1514900	1517580	screenshot and no man's sky that I loved.
1517580	1518580	So guess what?
1518580	1523600	So I decided to take my favorite virtual exploration game and combine it with my real world exploration
1523600	1524600	game.
1524600	1528620	So I made a banner in Ingress, a mission banner out of that screenshot.
1528620	1532420	So I only had time to do the first row by walking around the park and sadly I can't
1532420	1534500	put this on screen yet, but that's what it looks like.
1534500	1538860	So yeah, if you want to see that you can actually see it's a little screenshot from the game
1538860	1542660	and actually you can see my little Explorer there in the corner and uh, yeah, I thought
1542660	1543660	that was really cool.
1543660	1544660	So, uh, yeah.
1544660	1548540	Now I just have to finish the rest of it because once I do the, uh, cause I did the walk, it's,
1548540	1551780	it's one part walking and then you have to kind of drive a big loop around town just
1551780	1553420	cause it's the only way I can get enough portals.
1553420	1556280	I didn't want to do like another banner downtown.
1556280	1557280	There's already like a million of them.
1557480	1560400	So I did this one on the East side of town, like McKinley park, if you know where that
1560400	1563840	is, that's where this one of the all like that's, you have to walk that park to get
1563840	1564840	that first part.
1564840	1569100	Um, and then it's, or it's the lady, it's the lady bird park.
1569100	1572360	If you saw the movie, it's the Rose garden that they have a scene in.
1572360	1577600	I used to walk around that park every day at lunch when I worked at the cannery.
1577600	1578880	Yeah, it's a lovely park.
1578880	1583040	So mission four or something of that mission starts at that Rose garden.
1583040	1584040	So there you go.
1584040	1587160	A little, a little, uh, so if you've seen that movie, you know what I'm talking about.
1587520	1591120	Um, but anyway, uh, so that, that mission series is there and I'm looking forward to
1591120	1594920	doing the rest of it, which will have the kind of like Saturn looking planet behind
1594920	1595920	it with the rings.
1595920	1596920	It's very giant.
1596920	1599200	And this, this kind of the solar burst, I'm really excited to do that.
1599200	1602120	I like being able to mix my favorite games together like that.
1602120	1603120	So cool.
1603120	1604120	Yeah, it's fun.
1604120	1605120	Anyway.
1605120	1606120	All right.
1606120	1607120	So that was my gaming week.
1607120	1609440	Let's get into some of the headlines this week so far.
1609440	1610440	Yes.
1610440	1614560	So unfortunately we're going to start with some sad news.
1614560	1624480	So the creator of the Konami code, uh, Kazu, um, Hisha Hashimoto has died at age 61.
1624480	1625480	That's pretty young.
1625480	1628240	All things considered 61 is not old.
1628240	1632680	The age is actually disputed because it either says 61 or 79, depending on what source you
1632680	1633680	look at.
1633680	1634680	Oh, that's a huge discrepancy.
1634680	1635680	Yeah.
1635680	1636680	It's a big discrepancy.
1636680	1637680	Big discrepancy.
1637680	1638680	Right.
1638680	1639680	Regardless.
1639680	1643500	Uh, still sad to hear, but, uh, I didn't know, I guess I never knew that the actual code
1643540	1645620	was attributed to like one person.
1645620	1646620	I have to admit I did.
1646620	1647620	I did not know.
1647620	1648620	Did you know that Jim?
1648620	1649620	Maybe you did.
1649620	1650620	I didn't know it was attributed to just one person.
1650620	1655140	I thought it was just some type of like nebulous internal, you know, sometimes those old cheat
1655140	1656500	codes from back in the day.
1656500	1661100	But how many people were actually programmers on games during the NES era?
1661100	1662100	True.
1662100	1663100	True.
1663100	1664100	True.
1664100	1665100	No, you're right.
1665100	1666100	Or in the Atari 2600 era.
1666100	1667100	Right.
1667100	1668620	It was like one person made all those games or what, or would do a game.
1668620	1671460	Um, and, um, in the NES era, you're right.
1671460	1674860	It would be a small team, probably 10 or less that would make those games.
1674860	1675860	So that's true.
1675860	1681620	Um, and a lot of those old codes kind of came from, they were like bug testing or dev codes
1681620	1682700	basically.
1682700	1686460	So like other people weren't supposed to know the code.
1686460	1688820	So was Gradius the first game to use it?
1688820	1689820	Probably had to have been.
1689820	1690820	Right.
1690820	1691820	So use up.
1691820	1692820	Yeah.
1692820	1693820	Up, up, down, left, right, left, right, B, A start.
1693820	1695380	And that is what gets your ship all the like full power and everything.
1695380	1698940	So you can, you know, test the level a different way than having to earn it all.
1698940	1703340	So, and a lot of old cheat codes and I think even passwords and things like that were for
1703340	1704340	this.
1704340	1708940	Um, and they just would get left in the game because you know, back in the day it wasn't
1708940	1712660	as easy to just patch things out, you know, or things like that.
1712660	1716900	So they would just get left in the game and then eventually someone squeals, you know,
1716900	1720260	one of those devs tells their friend, you know, you can do this, you know, and then
1720260	1723020	that friend tells another friend and word spreads around.
1723020	1726980	I mean, I have a hard time believing somebody that word spreads to game pro magazine and
1727020	1728020	Exactly.
1728020	1732260	Or, or, you know, when, and I bet this technique was used.
1732260	1733260	Absolutely.
1733260	1738580	When sales of the game start slowing down, Oh, did you know there's a code generate interest
1738580	1742060	in the game again, get it printed in the next magazine so people can rent it or check it
1742060	1743060	out.
1743060	1746580	I'm absolutely sure that was part of the strategy back in the day.
1746580	1751220	Now it's, you know, sell them, sell them an unlock code for 99 cents.
1751220	1752220	But
1752900	1758460	And then we've got news that platinum games is publishing its own original game under
1758460	1765380	the working title project GG is that unlike any of the games we've made so far, it's going
1765380	1772120	to be a hundred percent platinum games title for everything from its yeah, for everything
1772120	1777820	from its setting to its characters and its game design and story to how it's promoted.
1777820	1780220	Platinum games is in full control.
1780220	1782700	And by the time this airs, they'll know what it is.
1782700	1783700	Right.
1783700	1786460	Cause I believe I heard platinum is pulling back the curtain on it tomorrow.
1786460	1787820	So yeah, they have a teaser.
1787820	1791660	So we'll have to wait and see, unfortunately you guys know something we don't know yet.
1791660	1794280	So I'm hearing a lot of chatter.
1794280	1799660	People think it might be beautiful Joe, another entry in the beautiful Joe series, but I mean,
1799660	1800660	it could be an original IP.
1800660	1803700	It looks a little more screenshots that they have.
1803700	1808540	Don't look like beautiful Joe, but wait and see where things have happened.
1808540	1809980	So yeah, we'll see.
1809980	1815060	I'm all, I'm all for original IP or what if it's, um, fucking, especially because they
1815060	1817280	say a hundred percent platinum and it's all plaid.
1817280	1818700	What if it's scaled down?
1818700	1822380	Remember how Microsoft stopped that way?
1822380	1825620	Cause that's the one thing I'm going to read into a little bit is how they say it's a hundred
1825620	1826620	percent platinum.
1826620	1827620	It's all platinum.
1827620	1829460	Like they're kind of framing something there.
1829460	1830460	Right.
1830460	1831460	I don't know.
1831460	1832460	Just okay.
1832460	1833460	I'm going to look stupid.
1833460	1834460	Cause y'all know something I don't yet.
1834460	1835460	So we're playing time warp here.
1835460	1836460	So we'll see.
1836460	1837460	All right.
1837460	1838460	Um, and this is kind of cool.
1838460	1843660	Uh, since I was just talking about Minecraft, you may remember back in 2013 that there was
1843660	1849140	a mass effect data pack for Minecraft that was released, which allowed you to play as
1849140	1855880	the skins of the characters from a mass effect, as well as, um, they had some of the, uh,
1855880	1857820	worlds and stuff from that as well.
1857820	1859020	I didn't know they got rid of it.
1859020	1863380	Well, yeah, it hasn't been compatible with the newer versions of Minecraft until just
1863380	1864380	now.
1864380	1868660	So you can actually play it on X-Box one PlayStation four, switch PC and mobile.
1868660	1869660	Got it.
1869660	1870660	Okay.
1870660	1872860	I just assumed, I guess maybe I didn't understand enough about how Minecraft worked.
1872860	1876160	I just assumed, Oh, you could only get it on the three 60 and whatever they don't sell
1876160	1877160	it on the other ones.
1877160	1878420	I didn't realize it was a compatibility.
1878420	1879420	Well, that's cool.
1879420	1882620	Have you ever seen the, um, because I know you're a big mass effect stand like me.
1882620	1886680	Have you ever seen like the Minecrafts or the mass effect skin for Minecraft?
1886680	1891860	Have I played Minecraft any, and in at least a year, it's super cute though, which I haven't
1891860	1892860	seen it.
1892860	1897160	Um, speaking of playing things in a year, uh, I'll give you guys an Allen update.
1897160	1901700	Allen is playing the mass effect trilogy from the start once again, because he said it's
1901700	1903560	been years and I want to play it again.
1903560	1905380	So that is his current like game of the moment.
1905380	1907540	I like how he thinks he's still on mass effect one.
1907540	1911020	It's been a couple of weeks, but that's, that's, that's very much because I know what he's
1911020	1912020	doing.
1912020	1913500	He's playing every single mission in the game.
1913500	1915180	That's what I always do.
1915180	1916180	Yep.
1916180	1921460	So anyway, um, and then speaking of Minecraft some more, and then we'll also talk about
1921460	1926820	it a little bit, Metroid fusion, somebody for some reason spent seven years of their
1926820	1935140	time programming Metroid fusion into Minecraft, actually recreating the game using tire game
1935140	1936140	or like just that.
1936140	1942460	Um, that's, I don't know if it's completely done yet, but, uh, basically he's got it.
1942460	1947460	It's all with command blocks and just, it's ridiculous.
1947460	1948820	Like the sprites and everything.
1948820	1954540	Now I would have thought this is made in dreams on PlayStation four or something like that.
1954540	1955540	Nope.
1955540	1962900	But yeah, they've got like, um, some images like that he shared back like years ago, but
1962900	1964900	it's just ridiculous.
1964900	1968820	But he's saying he's going to continue working on it until Nintendo shuts him down.
1968820	1969820	But he says he's fine.
1969820	1971940	He's a hundred percent fine with that, which will be tomorrow.
1971940	1975140	Well, it's been going on for seven years.
1975140	1979220	Is it something that can be put in Minecraft on the switch?
1979220	1984460	I don't know if that would be able to run to like, cause the, all the console versions
1984460	1987260	are kind of limited on how much space you have and all that.
1987260	1988260	Right.
1988260	1989260	Yeah.
1989260	1990260	It was pretty hard.
1990260	1991260	Um, but yeah, that's pretty crazy.
1991260	1993520	That'd be kind of funny if he put it on the switch and it's like, just try and shut me
1993520	1994520	down now.
1994520	1996520	This is funny.
1996520	1997740	Hackers can put it on the switch.
1997740	1998740	True.
1998740	1999740	True.
1999740	2003100	Um, and then we got it since we are just about the approach March, we've got our games of
2003100	2004780	gold and PlayStation.
2004780	2006060	You mean we're in March?
2006060	2007060	It's March 1st.
2007060	2008060	March 1st.
2008060	2009060	Today.
2009060	2010060	Right.
2010060	2011060	Check your calendar, Loki.
2011060	2012340	But these games haven't released yet, so that's fine.
2012340	2017260	Um, so on the Xbox side of things, we have Batman and the enemy within the complete season.
2017260	2020380	Um, and then we have Shantae half genie hero.
2020380	2022220	Those are the Xbox one games.
2022220	2027660	And then on Xbox three 60 Castlevania, Lord of shadows two and Sonic generations.
2027660	2030620	I'm sorry, but Lords of shadow one was bad enough.
2030620	2032660	Why did they have to give us two?
2032660	2034580	Because Konami has got to make some money.
2034580	2041940	And then, um, on the PlayStation side, we've got, uh, Sonic forces and shadow of the Colossus.
2041940	2042940	Okay.
2042940	2043940	Neat.
2043940	2044940	So not bad.
2044940	2051420	And then, uh, last but not least, uh, good old games has changed their refund policy.
2051420	2060060	So now if you play or purchase a game, you have 30 days after you purchase to, um, you
2060060	2062460	know, file for a refund.
2062460	2066740	However, there are, you know, and they're basically, they're saying that we trust that
2066740	2071620	you're making an informed purchase decisions and we'll use this updated voluntary refund
2071620	2072620	policy.
2072620	2077060	Only if something doesn't work for you as expected while there's a, this is why there
2077060	2080580	are no limits, but instead we reserve the right for refuse refunds.
2080580	2087540	In individual cases, please respect all the time and hard work, uh, put into making game
2087540	2089220	or making the games that you play.
2089220	2091900	And remember the refunds are not reviews.
2091900	2095780	If you finish the game and didn't like it, please consider sharing your opinion and said
2095780	2100380	also please don't take advantage of our trust by asking for an unreasonable amount of games
2100380	2101820	to be refunded.
2101820	2103360	Don't be that person.
2103360	2106380	No one likes that person.
2106380	2111740	So I like that, um, that comment there at the end, but yeah, I do feel like this might
2111740	2117060	open them up for some problems, but I mean, I'm just, I'm pretty sure that they're aware
2117060	2122700	of how people can be because there are those people out there that will do this, but you
2122700	2127020	know, I like that it's kind of open to, you know, don't be a dick because we'll know that
2127020	2132460	you're being a deck and we're not going to give you your refund.
2132460	2137060	That's very, that really opens it up though for like people to buy a game, beat the game,
2137060	2139860	refund the game, like using this as a rental system.
2139860	2143380	They can look at it and see them kind of seeing that that's what you're doing.
2143380	2144380	Okay.
2144380	2145380	Yeah.
2145380	2146380	All right.
2146700	2149740	So I suppose I'd be very curious what the statistics look like a little bit after this.
2149740	2154040	I mean, sometimes when you kind of trust, like, you know, there's a lot of games out
2154040	2160300	there that just don't have any DRM at all and they still sell pretty darn well, even
2160300	2161300	with piracy.
2161300	2162300	I don't think these games have DRM.
2162300	2163300	I don't think they do either.
2163300	2166420	So, but that's kind of a, if you think about it though, that still kind of sucks though
2166420	2171260	for the individual, because I'm assuming that GOG isn't taking a hit on this stuff.
2171260	2174860	So that kind of sucks for the indie developers that put out some of these games on the service
2174860	2179580	and then 30 days later, you know, they may be getting money taken away from them.
2179580	2180580	Depends on the abuse.
2180580	2183580	It depends what maybe GOG's promised them about how they're going to enforce it.
2183580	2188500	Like, you know, if a person does this X many of times, an X window, we're going to review
2188500	2193540	the play time and maybe, you know, not allow them to use the system anymore.
2193540	2194540	So we'll see.
2194540	2197760	Or GOG has achievements, right?
2197760	2200740	So that's what the achievements can come back to bite you because you will look at the achievements
2200740	2202460	to see the person beat the game and then refunded it.
2202460	2205580	And it's like, okay, come on, what are you doing?
2205580	2208140	So it's going to be an interesting way to monitor the accounts.
2208140	2209140	I don't know.
2209140	2210140	All right.
2210140	2211140	All right.
2211140	2214780	Well, if that's it from you, let's let's check in with Dark Soccer and see what stories she
2214780	2215780	wants to talk about tonight.
2215780	2217260	There's always shenanigans, you know.
2217260	2218260	There is.
2218260	2222220	Well, Harmonics has unveiled a new game.
2222220	2225700	It's called Fuser, where it is a mixing game.
2225700	2231460	You play as a DJ at a festival, as long as it's not Coachella because the owner is a
2231460	2234020	bad person.
2234020	2239140	So it looks like they're going to have over one hundred songs that you can mix in real
2239140	2240140	time.
2240140	2246060	So you grab vocals from one and the guitar from another mashup simulator.
2246060	2252500	Pretty much it's it's literally drop mix like Harmonics already did this game, except there's
2252500	2254180	a twist.
2254180	2255520	Drop mix is a board game.
2255520	2257540	It's a tangible thing with real cards.
2257540	2260100	This is going to sell better.
2260100	2261220	This is going to sell better.
2261220	2263260	And it's Magic the Gathering online, basically.
2263260	2264260	Right.
2264260	2265260	Yeah.
2265260	2270620	But basically, yeah, it's like you're going to be managing from from you have four different
2270620	2278700	decks and you have a few restrictions on what you can do.
2278700	2280620	But it has to be the four.
2280620	2287060	So it's going to be on Switch, PS4, PC and the Xbone.
2287060	2289220	So we'll see what it comes out like.
2289340	2290340	It looks like it could be fun.
2290340	2295380	Yeah, I mean, I love drop mix like it's cool, but I understand like the game itself for
2295380	2299700	drop mix is kind of like it's like it's it's one of those games.
2299700	2300700	Do you remember?
2300700	2303780	Do you remember the board game Mouse Trap that never worked?
2303780	2304780	Yeah.
2304780	2308340	Well, it was also more fun to just set up the trap or try to put the trap in different
2308340	2313620	ways or, you know, try to see what other weird things you can do with the parts than it was
2313620	2316080	to actually play mouse trap.
2316080	2318500	And I think that's the kind of thing that happens with drop mix.
2318500	2321620	Like it's more fun to just sit there and play with the cards and make your own mixes
2321620	2326460	than it is like actually played drop mix music going back to the 70s on here.
2326460	2328860	I mean, oh, the song list is great.
2328860	2329860	Yeah.
2329860	2336580	I mean, though, we've got Blue Oyster Cult, The Clash, some Gaga, some Lizzo, of course.
2336580	2337580	Yes.
2337580	2341340	Gaga, you know, through the 90s, the aughts through all of it.
2341340	2344500	So it looks like it could be pretty interesting.
2344500	2345500	I mean, hello.
2345500	2346740	Y'all know I love music games.
2346740	2347740	I'll buy it.
2347740	2348740	Of course.
2348740	2349740	Exactly.
2349740	2350740	Yeah.
2350740	2351740	Yeah.
2351740	2354780	So, um, that's the wrong link.
2354780	2357060	I was helping somebody find beard sanitizer.
2357060	2364580	Oh, I was like, no, it's an immunocompromised friend who has worries about the now airborne
2364580	2370060	COVID, the now local and airborne.
2370060	2372060	I thought there was only one case here locally.
2372060	2373060	Yeah, I know.
2373060	2375020	It's some big deal.
2375020	2377100	I'm not worried.
2377100	2378340	I'm not bothered.
2378340	2383740	I'm about to go on a cruise and hopefully, um, it doesn't take me a month to get back.
2383740	2384740	Who knows?
2384740	2386180	This might be the last OLR for six minutes.
2386180	2387180	So many announcements.
2387180	2389980	They're like, oh my God, open the floodgates now.
2389980	2396120	I just hope it's not like it was a few years ago when I had swine flu and didn't know it.
2396120	2400580	If there's any, if there's any, if, if I do end up trapped on a boat due to COVID, at
2400580	2404580	least I'll be trapped on a boat with Wilson Cruz and Kate Mulgrew.
2404580	2408900	So it's like, you know, I will, I will play with your cat.
2408900	2409900	Okay.
2409900	2410900	Thank you.
2410900	2412540	I already told Dan I was going to come over to entertain the smush.
2412540	2413540	Oh God, that's right.
2413540	2414540	Oh my God.
2414540	2415740	How would we take care of the cat?
2415740	2418980	You would honestly like, I'll just, you would have to just take some motion to your own
2418980	2419980	home.
2419980	2422340	He and Midna would fight over the food bowl.
2422340	2423340	Well, it's just, yeah.
2423340	2424700	And why are we even entertaining this?
2424700	2425700	It's not going to happen.
2425700	2428700	Why are we even entertaining this?
2428700	2432420	Anyways, streets of rage four.
2432420	2435580	We like to fantasize about all the bad things that can happen to us.
2435580	2442380	Well, just drew posted on Facebook a little bit ago, the, the quote from a welcome to
2442380	2443380	Night Vale.
2443380	2445900	May all of your dreams come true.
2445900	2446900	All of them.
2446900	2450620	Oh no, no, no, no, no.
2450620	2452700	Anyway, streets of rage four.
2452700	2455940	It's getting some new stuff.
2455940	2461180	When it launches, there is going to be two person online co-op.
2461180	2462980	Yay.
2462980	2468660	And up to four player offline co-op, yay.
2468660	2473980	And there's going to be a new playable characters.
2473980	2481100	One of them is Floyd, who is cybernetic.
2481100	2487340	He actually was upgraded due to Dr. Zan from streets of rage three.
2487340	2490100	He's slow, but strong.
2490100	2498220	So yeah, streets of rage four, hopefully, hopefully it's going to be awesome.
2498220	2499540	Well, Yuzuru Koshiro is doing the music.
2499540	2500540	That's all I need.
2500540	2501540	Okay.
2501540	2502540	That's all I care about then.
2502540	2504980	And there better be bare knuckle arcade machines in it.
2504980	2506980	We'll see.
2506980	2510780	So little bit more.
2510780	2517940	Dragon Ball Fighter, Dragon Ball Fighter's season three has gone live with a bunch of
2517940	2519380	different changes.
2519380	2525180	You get something called Z assist that gives you assist attacks for every member of the
2525180	2528740	roster, kind of like how it worked for Marvel versus Capcom.
2528740	2533940	And it lets you create even crazier combos in the game.
2533940	2539820	You would be able to choose your partner for like juggling or projectile or a little bit
2539820	2540820	more on that.
2540820	2544300	So it'll be, it'll be pretty neat.
2544300	2549020	Few other things is that you will have a limit break.
2549020	2550020	Thanks Final Fantasy seven.
2550020	2552180	I was like, what is this Final Fantasy?
2552180	2553180	Right.
2553180	2558460	But basically when the player is down to their last fighter, they will get a slight damage
2558460	2564340	boost and a free bar of meter allowing, which would basically make them do like a last stand
2564340	2565340	attack.
2565340	2568500	That's kind of similar to Mortal Kombat 11's fatal blows.
2568500	2571980	So it's really just a combat mechanic.
2571980	2573360	And then some new characters.
2573360	2577380	So Kefla will be in there.
2577380	2584060	And then there will also be ultra instinct Goku.
2584060	2589980	All the Goku will be in the game, but I don't know.
2589980	2593320	I mean this character, she kind of annoyed me in the series.
2593320	2597580	So I mean she was cool, but annoying in the series.
2597580	2600900	So yeah, some, some cool stuff.
2600900	2602780	Played the Dragon Ballses.
2602780	2608900	I still have yet to unfortunately play this game, but at some point I'll play it eventually.
2608900	2610260	I reckon.
2610260	2613100	You know, I'm looking at this next story that I'm going to talk about.
2613100	2617220	And there's a, it's, this is one of those cases of advertising working because I'm presented
2617220	2621780	with a giant ad for the Double Dragon and Kunio-kun retro brawler bundle, which is kind
2621780	2624640	of neat, which I remember discussing on a previous show.
2624640	2628920	What I forgot was that, oh, it's like coming out like now, or in this case it's already
2628920	2629920	out.
2629920	2630920	I forgot.
2630920	2631920	So you've played it.
2631920	2632920	You and Dan have played it?
2632920	2633920	Our friend has it.
2633920	2635560	He brought over a Switch and we enjoyed some of it.
2635560	2636560	It was pretty fun.
2636560	2637560	Is it neat?
2637560	2638560	Yeah.
2638560	2639560	I can't wait to play some of this.
2639560	2640560	It's old school.
2640560	2641560	Yeah.
2641560	2642560	It's the classics.
2642560	2644400	And I'm excited that we have like new games in English basically.
2644400	2645400	This is a trend.
2645400	2648160	And it's the old school, like legit Niketsu games.
2648160	2649160	Yeah.
2649160	2654260	This is this random trend I'm loving all of a sudden is like all of these old ass retro
2654260	2658180	games are suddenly getting localized for mother three.
2658180	2659180	Fuck you.
2659180	2664820	Well, to be fair, mother three already was localized for Europe, but yeah, anyway, I
2664820	2665820	know.
2665820	2666820	Oh, I guess.
2666820	2667820	Yeah.
2667820	2668820	We continue to get screwed when it comes to mother three.
2668820	2671900	But, uh, well I was thinking trials of manna of course was the thing on my brain.
2671900	2672900	So there's that.
2672900	2673900	So, all right.
2673900	2677860	Uh, anyway, the story I was actually going to read before I got distracted by a giant
2677860	2678860	advertisement.
2678860	2686940	Um, was talking a little bit about, um, the, um, no, Alan just got home.
2686940	2687940	That's not the cat.
2687940	2688940	He liked it.
2688940	2689940	The cat get out.
2689940	2690940	Well, cause it didn't shut the door all the way.
2690940	2691940	No, you're fine.
2691940	2692940	You're fine.
2692940	2693940	Alan is probably opening a window.
2693940	2694940	Um, it is.
2694940	2695940	It is a little hot in here.
2695940	2700580	Um, it's just me anyway.
2700580	2704140	The story, the 2020 PlayStation player celebration.
2704140	2705140	That's right.
2705140	2708380	Uh, you have a chance to play more games and earn more trophies this year.
2708380	2710340	It's the PlayStation player celebration.
2710340	2715180	If the community hits some different milestones, such as half a million trophies, uh, you get
2715180	2723580	exclusive PS4 themes and avatars and, and one of the big prizes, a real life platinum
2723580	2724980	trophy.
2724980	2725980	That's right.
2725980	2730260	You can have a platinum trophy IRL and you can show all your friends just how big your
2730260	2733140	E-penis is with your, uh, put that on your Tinder profile.
2733140	2734140	That's right.
2734140	2735140	Put that on your Tinder profile.
2735140	2736140	Anyway.
2736140	2737620	Um, this just got underway.
2737860	2742900	I think February 24th was in the first community goals started, uh, which was a 125,000 games
2742900	2745460	played and 500,000 trophies earned.
2745460	2749180	There will be an exclusive static PS4 theme.
2749180	2753540	And I imagine that, um, people were probably going to unlock all these things anyway.
2753540	2757700	I just, I just don't see how the community doesn't actually unlock all these things.
2757700	2760300	So cause they put pretty achievable goals in there.
2760300	2761300	Yeah.
2761300	2765780	They probably know like the averages and they probably bumped it up slightly, but not too
2765780	2766780	much.
2766940	2769660	So it's, it's, I'm sure it'll, it'll be effective.
2769660	2774820	So, um, and then the only other things I really wanted to talk about, oops, I just randomly
2774820	2778580	closed the story, but I remember that, uh, there's some changes with Overwatch.
2778580	2784060	Uh, one of them is that the, uh, Overwatch league matches, some of them are getting canceled
2784060	2788340	due to COVID, um, which is kind of not new news right now.
2788340	2789340	Right.
2789340	2792400	We've hearing a lot of different things are getting canceled or people backing out or
2792400	2793400	so forth.
2793400	2795780	It will be interesting to see how PAX East went.
2795780	2797980	Um, I'm not, I'm not worried about COVID.
2797980	2802740	I'm just thinking about like how that goes with a lot of the folks that have dropped
2802740	2805820	out, you know, but you know, having been to PAX and we've all been to PAX.
2805820	2808540	I mean, we went to PAX prime one year, all of us together.
2808540	2809540	That was a fun year.
2809540	2814740	Um, but you know, there's a lot of like board games going on 24 seven and land and you know,
2814740	2816220	people just celebrating gaming.
2816220	2819940	So I feel like there's, it's not like there's going to be a shortage of things to do.
2819940	2823780	It's just that, you know, the expo hall is going to be a little, little less exciting,
2823780	2824780	but they've still got Indies.
2824780	2826020	They got plenty of stuff to see.
2826020	2833700	So anyway, um, but the Overwatch league, South Korean matches are being canceled due to the,
2833700	2839020	um, novel coronavirus worries or COVID, um, because, uh, unfortunately the more and more
2839020	2842980	and more and more cases are showing up in South Korea, just like we're hearing in Italy.
2842980	2847080	Uh, and, um, what was it Iran, I think is the other big one since we last did a show.
2847080	2850220	So fortunately it's, unfortunately it's spreading.
2850220	2853540	Um, so some more events are being affected because of it.
2853540	2857700	But something that will definitely affect everyone in Overwatch is a new experimental
2857700	2858700	mode.
2858700	2861900	So you may or may not know, depending on how much you play Overwatch, they changed the
2861900	2867380	queuing system sometimes ago to be two tanks, two healers and two DPS.
2867380	2870580	So that way you kind of queue for matches in a certain role.
2870580	2877700	Well, uh, Overwatch is now testing a new mode where you can actually do three DPS and one
2877700	2879380	tank and two healers.
2879380	2882460	Uh, so they call it triple DPS or something like that, triple damage.
2882460	2883460	That's it.
2883460	2885360	And they're calling it an experimental mode.
2885360	2888740	So it's, it's not like they didn't replace the two, two, two system with this as a side
2888740	2889740	thing.
2889740	2893340	Um, but it's supposed to help improve queue times because everybody wants to be DPS.
2893340	2895600	Everybody wants to play Hanzo for some reason.
2895600	2898020	So this is supposed to help those queue times.
2898020	2903640	So and the feedback on this will make Blizzard decide if they want to implement this into
2903640	2904640	standard play.
2904640	2909660	Uh, a quote from, um, Jeff Kaplan, who is the lead designer, the experimental card is
2909660	2913820	really focused on radical gameplay changes or things that we want to try out to get your
2913820	2915660	direct player feedback on.
2915660	2917540	We are unsure of these.
2917540	2919980	Um, so we'll see how that goes.
2919980	2924000	Most people I've seen on Twitter seem to be enjoying it so far though, and it makes sense.
2924000	2928980	So it's just changing one tank to a DPS and more people want to queue as DPS anyway.
2928980	2929980	So it makes sense.
2929980	2930980	Yeah.
2930980	2931980	So we'll see where that goes.
2931980	2935420	Anyway, that is it for the stories that we were going to cover tonight.
2935420	2938940	So we're going to go into the listener round table since we're not live tonight, we can't
2938940	2943340	take your, um, phone calls on discord, but we can talk about some of the stories that
2943340	2944620	you guys have been posting on discord.
2944620	2948900	Um, you guys have been posting a lot of stories and I think we already touched on some of
2948900	2949900	them.
2949900	2952820	Like I know the Konami code one came up and some other things, but I thought this one
2952820	2953820	was really cute.
2953820	2958380	So we got linked to a story that talks about Nintendo's customer support going above and
2958380	2961580	beyond, uh, for an older lady.
2961580	2965260	Um, and, uh, this was reported in a local newspaper.
2965260	2971020	Um, I think it was picked up off of Twitter, but basically long story short, um, this gal's
2971020	2974260	mom always played her Game Boy.
2974260	2980700	Um, and when she reached the age of 85, 95, her Game Boy stopped working, but they wanted
2980700	2984020	her to be able to be happy and still play Tetris on Game Boy and stuff.
2984020	2987740	So they called Nintendo to try to fix the Game Boy, but of course the Game Boy, they're
2987740	2989580	no longer supported, right?
2989580	2992260	Well, Nintendo's support went above and beyond.
2992260	2998060	And what happened, they, they found a, um, I guess they got within a week of response
2998060	3003460	saying they didn't have the parts, but they found a brand new Game Boy in a warehouse
3003460	3006580	of like, you know, this actually is a very common thing.
3006580	3013020	I'm thinking like the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark that, well, companies do keep surplus
3013020	3014660	stock on hand.
3014660	3020180	Case in point, go back to those cases of why Atari had a landfill at one point, because
3020180	3023260	there was so much surplus stock because everything got sent back.
3023260	3025060	They literally had no place to put it.
3025060	3030440	But it's not super uncommon for companies to hold on to surplus stock of certain things.
3030440	3032740	Four cases kind of like this, actually.
3032740	3037380	Like I know my high school, I know this because I was on the yearbook committee in high school,
3037380	3041340	there's a, there was a shed out back that was a storage shed and what they had, they
3041340	3047420	had one box of every yearbook they've ever printed over the years.
3047420	3050060	So when I was, there was like 30 years worth of yearbooks and there's probably another
3050060	3051700	30 years worth of yearbooks there now.
3051700	3056920	And it was specifically for when people would call the school and say, my house burned down
3056920	3061000	or I lost this in a fire or is there any way I can replace this?
3061000	3065540	They have one box of books to be able to, so if you've ever lost your yearbook, call
3065540	3069440	your school, they might have something if that's something of importance to you.
3069440	3071400	So I thought that was kind of neat.
3071400	3075540	So I think this is, this is partially that and partially just sometimes you don't know
3075540	3077380	where else to put this shit.
3077380	3079700	Like, have you ever looked at your garage?
3079700	3082420	You probably have a lot of shit out there that you don't really need.
3082420	3086220	And I think a lot of this happens with Nintendo too.
3086220	3087460	It wouldn't really surprise me.
3087460	3094340	I mean, I've bought sealed in box old stuff from work, you know, not going to say where
3094340	3096660	I work, but I've done it before.
3096660	3097660	Sure.
3097660	3098660	Yeah.
3098660	3101820	So anyway, you know, so I don't think it's quite as novel that they still have one on
3101820	3105220	hand, but what is novel is the fact that they did, they went the extra mile and sent her
3105220	3109320	that for free with a letter wishing a nice long life.
3109320	3113940	And as a nice footnote here, the grandmother lived to be 99.
3113940	3116420	So went on another four years.
3116420	3119240	So powered by Game Boy and four AA batteries.
3119240	3120240	So very nice.
3120240	3121240	Cool.
3121240	3123660	I thought that was a very nice story from our discord.
3123660	3128040	So let me get to some tweets.
3128040	3129200	Going to some tweets.
3129200	3135520	I opened up the Twitter earlier this week at OLR and I like four or five times asked
3135520	3136880	for stories and we got two.
3136880	3137880	We got two tweets.
3138440	3142240	So I'm a little bit sad that more people aren't tweeting us, but to be fair, I should probably
3142240	3144680	be more active on the Twitter if I want more people to engage.
3144680	3146840	So I will try to get better at that.
3146840	3149200	In the meantime, we will read these tweets that we got.
3149200	3154200	So our first tweet tonight from Garth the Wolf, who tweets us, have you guys checked
3154200	3156800	out Nier Automata yet?
3156800	3160960	It's legitimately one of the best games I've played and probably my favorite of this past
3160960	3161960	generation.
3161960	3164740	It also has a killer soundtrack and story.
3164740	3166240	Please check it out if you get the chance.
3166600	3168600	Has anyone played Nier Automata?
3168600	3171960	It's been on my wish list for a while, but it's been on my list and I haven't got to.
3171960	3172960	You know what's sad?
3172960	3176920	I've played the first Nier, a little bit of it, but I still haven't played Nier Automata.
3176920	3179320	But and I don't know if you know about this.
3179320	3181980	That's the game where if you eat a fish you'll die.
3181980	3188100	In Final Fantasy 14, the raids right now, the new 24 man raids are all inspired by because
3188100	3191640	they're co-created by the guy behind Nier Automata.
3191640	3196000	So this current raid, the 24 man raid, and I've been running this raid quite a few times.
3196760	3199040	It's called the Copied Factory and it's inspired by Nier.
3199040	3203600	So a lot of the monster design, because it doesn't look like Final Fantasy when you're
3203600	3204600	in there.
3204600	3210120	It's all big, these gigantic mech robots and things, and the last guy's in a tank and it's
3210120	3211440	like Transformers and shit.
3211440	3215040	He transforms into a plane that starts gunning you on the ground and stuff, but it's really
3215040	3216040	cool.
3216040	3218440	But the music is some of the best music in the game.
3218440	3225280	And I don't know if they lifted it from Nier or if they had, who's the guy who does all
3225280	3226280	the music?
3226280	3228640	The guy, I can't remember his name in the moment, but the guy who does all the music
3228640	3229640	in Final Fantasy 14?
3229640	3230640	Sakurai?
3230640	3231640	Sakurai, yeah.
3231640	3237280	I don't know if they had him do all that, but yeah.
3237280	3238640	I love the music in there.
3238640	3239640	It's some of the best.
3239640	3240640	So, all right.
3240640	3243120	I'll have to put that on the list.
3243120	3249720	Anyway, let's go to Dark Tetsuya who says, I've been playing Contra Rogue Core and I
3249720	3253560	have to say it's not nearly as bad as people are saying it is.
3253560	3257280	Incidentally, on the subject of the Konami code, it does appear in the game, but really
3257280	3261240	only to obtain one of the game's various medals.
3261240	3262480	Still a neat nod to it.
3262480	3263480	Oh, so that's kind of cute.
3263480	3267040	So you put in the Konami code and it's like, sorry, you don't get shit, but this achievement
3267040	3268040	is nothing.
3268040	3270300	Yeah, but I've watched gameplay of that and it looks really terrible.
3270300	3276480	Like I get it, it's not as terrible as you thought it is, but it's still pretty terrible.
3276480	3277580	I'm not playing it.
3277580	3283520	I was really excited for it too, but then I saw the gameplay and I'm like, no, no, there's
3283520	3285480	no, that's not, that's not Contra.
3285480	3286480	I'm sorry.
3286480	3287480	Well, okay.
3287480	3291360	But has there ever been a game, and I asked this for Dark Soccer or, you know, anyone
3291360	3294400	out there really, cause I know we still have a chat room going tonight.
3294400	3301360	Has there been a game where like everybody just shit on the game, but you like the game,
3301360	3302360	dammit.
3302360	3304680	Like it's not as bad as everybody says it is.
3304680	3307760	For me, okay, I'm gonna tell you what game for me that is.
3307760	3313640	Friday the 13th on the original NES, because I think that game, at least when I was a kid
3313640	3318000	legit scared the hell out of me and I thought it was a really good soundtrack and I thought
3318000	3319360	it was really hard.
3319360	3322880	I remember being a total flop at the game, but then I see all this stuff later about
3322880	3325160	how like, oh, it's the worst NES game ever made.
3325160	3326160	No, it's not.
3326160	3327160	It's not the worst.
3327160	3329560	There are far worse games on the NES.
3329560	3330560	So that's like one of mine.
3330560	3336820	Are there any like games that everybody shit on, but you're like, it's not that bad.
3336820	3337820	And it's Soken.
3337820	3344380	I'm like Sakurai is the guy that made Smash Brothers, that's not his name, Soken.
3344380	3349620	I don't know off the top of my head, I mean, I'm sure I've liked some really bad games
3349620	3356740	out there, but I can't think of, I liked Abadox for a while, I mean, but that wasn't really
3356740	3357860	that bad of a game.
3357860	3360940	I know.
3360940	3364780	There was a hot minute where my brothers and I were super obsessed with playing the terrible
3364780	3373700	Home Alone game on SNES and I did enjoy Blastress with the Super Scope, but Blastress was fun.
3373700	3376780	There's not like too many really bad games.
3376780	3381020	There was something really novel about the fact that the Super Nintendo, it didn't just
3381020	3384060	have a light gun, it had a fucking bazooka.
3384060	3389060	Like talk about one of the most bad ass peripherals that a company has ever put out, like Justice
3389060	3390060	for the Super Scope.
3390060	3391060	That thing was awesome.
3391060	3392060	It's pretty good.
3392060	3393060	I know.
3393060	3394060	I miss, I miss the bazooka.
3394340	3395340	We need that.
3395340	3396340	We need a bazooka game.
3396340	3399980	Hey, YYR.
3399980	3401460	He's not manufacturing peripherals.
3401460	3402740	No, no, no, we need it.
3402740	3407580	We need a sharpshooter mode because this, buy sharpshooter on Steam.
3407580	3408580	There's your plug.
3408580	3409580	Okay.
3409580	3412820	But we need a mode that supports a bazooka.
3412820	3413820	I'm sorry.
3413820	3414820	He's not supporting that.
3414820	3415820	No, I know.
3415820	3416820	He, what?
3416820	3419060	He, he doesn't just exist to make all of our wishes come true.
3419060	3423380	You can, you can just have to, you'll have to rig it yourself using some sort of like,
3423380	3428900	I don't know what sort of jank peripheral would connect the Super Scope to a computer
3428900	3429900	and then do it that way.
3429900	3430900	It's gotta be out there.
3430900	3438340	They do have controller converters, so it wouldn't be too hard.
3438340	3439340	Yeah.
3439340	3441660	It's just a matter of being able to read the screen and all that.
3441660	3443540	Which you probably can't do.
3443540	3444540	Yeah.
3444540	3445540	All right.
3445540	3446540	Yeah.
3446540	3448020	Because like light guns don't even work on new TVs.
3448020	3453260	But I'm sure that by some magic and a raspberry pie shoved into a Super Scope, you probably
3453260	3454260	could make it work.
3454260	3455260	There we go.
3455260	3456260	Now we're talking.
3456260	3457260	Now we're talking.
3457260	3458260	All right.
3458260	3460460	Anyhow, uh, that's, that's it for the listener round table for tonight.
3460460	3465780	You can always tweet us more, uh, at OLR if you want to send us a tweet or excuse me,
3465780	3467060	you can always send us an email as well.
3467060	3468060	Cause I don't think we haven't.
3468060	3469400	I like the excite truck.
3469400	3474780	That's not necessarily a highly, I don't think anyone hated that game, but I, I really liked
3474780	3475780	that game.
3475780	3476780	I did.
3476780	3478100	You liked it more than most people did.
3478100	3479100	Yes.
3479100	3483020	It was an awesome game in which we'll never be a sequel for, you know,
3483780	3486340	or all there was, but that was absolute garbage.
3486340	3488680	Like what the hell were you thinking?
3488680	3492460	Make a sandwich in the middle of the goddamn race, throw a pie at a clown.
3492460	3493460	What the fuck is that?
3493460	3494580	That's not a racing game.
3494580	3497100	The whole fact that they kind of like took excite bike.
3497100	3501380	I mean, and like it was one of those things, like I didn't even get it until like the game
3501380	3503380	was already out and I've been playing it for a couple of weeks.
3503380	3507740	I was like, Oh, excite bike excite truck.
3507740	3512700	Oh, it's not really at all the same, but it's because they're not, they're not at all.
3512700	3517020	Aside from like maybe the turbo mechanic was kind of similar, but then that was about where
3517020	3518020	it ended.
3518020	3525940	Um, but you know, then excite bots just went off the fucking rails and on the rails too,
3525940	3528820	because there was rail sliding in that game for God knows what reason.
3528820	3529820	All right.
3529820	3534060	Anyway, if you want to email us, participate at orange line trader.com or if you want to
3534060	3540220	tweet us at O L R let's take a trip down memory lane and visit the classic game of the week.
3540220	3543940	So every week, dark soccer likes to step into the, into the gaming vault and find a game
3543940	3548300	that she says, Hey, you should, you should put this in your house and play it.
3548300	3549300	Good luck.
3549300	3553900	I mean, you'd have to have a pretty big house for this, uh, for the folks on Twitch.
3553900	3557780	I do not have video footage of this tonight just because we had to put this show together
3557780	3558780	very fast.
3558780	3562180	Um, but this is, this is an interesting pick anyway.
3562180	3563780	I feel like it's not something that would work.
3563780	3568100	I think this video half peripheral of the month, we're going back to that.
3568100	3571420	It's the nausea game for me too, because I used to get really motion sick with this,
3571420	3572420	but it's Radice.
3572420	3573420	It's metal as fuck.
3573420	3574420	Yeah.
3574420	3577220	Dan, this was like his whole reason for ever wanting to go to Dave and busters.
3577220	3578220	Yep.
3578220	3581540	And so Bobby Blackwell is going to perk up cause I know he's a fan of this too.
3581540	3584620	So I picked a battle tech centers.
3584620	3588860	It's basically virtual environment venues.
3588860	3597120	So you have these pods, uh, fully enclosed cockpits that have, uh, multiple screens inside
3597160	3599520	rudder pedals, joysticks.
3599520	3605640	I would be, I wouldn't be surprised if this was the inspiration for, um, great.
3605640	3611040	Now I don't remember the English name techa, X-Box mecha game.
3611040	3617440	Um, I remember the, with the $200 accessory, it was like mech warrior mech.
3617440	3618440	No it wasn't mech warrior.
3618440	3619920	I know what you're thinking of.
3619920	3620920	It's a steel battalion.
3620920	3621920	Steel battalion.
3621920	3622920	Thank you.
3622920	3628840	Um, but any, anyway, um, I wouldn't be surprised if this was an inspiration for it.
3628840	3634880	So at any rate, um, it, it could be found all over, um, you, you actually can still
3634880	3640320	find them in some places in the U S but the first battle tech center opened in Chicago
3640320	3646560	in 1990 there was another one in Yokohama in August, 1992 Tokyo, 1993.
3647440	3654000	Um, and eventually 26 facilities opened up that had, you know, more elaborate operations.
3654000	3656560	The locations were called virtual world.
3656560	3659880	We had one in the middle of like, I don't even remember what it was called, but it was
3659880	3664240	like some sort of like super bar that was like multiple bars and you had to walk through
3664240	3666440	the bar to get to the virtual world thing.
3666440	3670040	So that was always weird because I heard you like bars.
3670040	3671040	It was, it was weird.
3671040	3674060	Like I don't remember what it was called, but it was like, they have like seven bars
3674060	3677140	all attached to each other and it was the strangest thing.
3677140	3679220	But virtual world was right in the middle for some reason.
3679220	3685560	Well, at any rate, um, it consisted of 16 networked pods, um, that partially designed
3685560	3687100	by frog design.
3687100	3691860	Um, and it was highly interactive and really fun.
3691860	3696940	Um, it actually was even in a discovery channel documentary called beyond 2000.
3696940	3702460	Um, you could compete against players and other centers across the country.
3702700	3709260	Um, they actually had another non battle tech game included called red planet that had,
3709260	3713140	it was racing through mining tunnels on, on Mars using hovercrafts.
3713140	3720620	Um, but then of course as, um, you know, our, you know, arcade games advanced, you know,
3720620	3725980	by 2000 there were no more operational battle tech centers in Japan.
3725980	3733940	Um, in 1996 virtual world and, uh, FASA entertainment technologies merged, um, and became a wholly
3733940	3739620	owned subsidiaries of virtual world entertainment group and then Microsoft bottom.
3739620	3746860	So, um, they, uh, wanted to, they actually integrated, um, a lot of that into the Microsoft
3746860	3748980	game studio division.
3748980	3754840	And then all of the interest in virtual worlds entertainment was sold to some other guy and
3754840	3756400	their offices went to Kalamazoo.
3756400	3758160	Yeah, it was kind of funny.
3758160	3764280	Um, but anyway, um, as it literally went to Kalamazoo, it's not just a, no, seriously,
3764280	3766720	the office made from Chicago to Kalamazoo.
3766720	3772920	Um, so there was, um, the virtual world Tesla two cockpits.
3772920	3780440	Um, they opened, um, in November, 2005 with eight Tesla two, uh, uh, pods and then they
3780440	3782080	added another four.
3782120	3786280	And so now they do the, uh, battle tech invitational with 12 pods.
3786280	3788800	I mean, it's kind of evolved since then.
3788800	3796560	And sometimes, um, like there is a company called mech jock LLC, uh, we fit the existed
3796560	3802840	Tesla two pods so that they could bring those battle tech centers to a different, uh, conventions.
3802840	3804960	So they brought it to gen con 2007.
3804960	3810960	Uh, it's been brought to, uh, comic Palooza, Oni Con, mecha con and dragon con.
3810960	3811960	Do you've seen it at dragon?
3812480	3815920	It is there every year at dragon con, but it's one of those staples.
3815920	3820280	Like if it ever disappeared, like even though I've never done it in all the years that I've
3820280	3822900	always walked by and go, Oh cool, I remember those.
3822900	3825080	And there's always a group that's there playing it.
3825080	3827580	But, um, and all the years I've been to dragon con, I've never done it.
3827580	3831720	But like, if it left, I would be like, how could they get rid of that?
3831720	3833880	Like, you know, you know how that is, right?
3833880	3834880	Oh yeah.
3834880	3839840	Oh, other cons that, um, it's, uh, is going to be at or has been at, there'll also be
3839840	3847320	gen con origins, ASIN and Yomakon, um, in 2006, some players in Japan bought four Tesla
3847320	3851720	pods from the U S and put together a virtual world center in Tokyo.
3851720	3854560	Um, what year was that again?
3854560	3855560	Uh, 2006.
3855560	3856560	Oh.
3856560	3862680	And, um, but the pods are semi operational, even though they had no way to, uh, really
3862680	3863680	repair them.
3863680	3865120	They can't get the parts for them anymore.
3865120	3870240	Um, June, 2012, Mr. Biggs family center closed and their assets were auctioned off, including
3870240	3872080	their 12 pods.
3872080	3878520	Um, and, uh, now someone owns 12 pods.
3878520	3885200	So he removed, he removed his assets and put them into storage.
3885200	3892520	Um, 2011, along with a, uh, along with a pallet of unopened game boys in 2007, the airlock
3892520	3898280	in Kirkland, Washington, um, close with eight Tesla simulators transferred and the Washington
3898280	3905580	secretary of state, um, uh, yeah, there's like a show called better than life says that
3905580	3906580	it's inactive.
3906580	3909320	Some of this doesn't make sense as how it's put on here.
3909320	3915120	Um, there were eight pods in 2011 that were listed on Facebook, um, for, uh, at two private
3915120	3916120	home arcades.
3916120	3923720	Um, 2017 virtual world entertainment read, launch its website at mech jock.com, um, stating
3923720	3929400	that they're developing cockpits again and have updated software featuring 5.07 D to
3929400	3931840	be played in Houston, grand Rapids and Minneapolis.
3931840	3939220	Yeah, those are pretty dated by 2018, a battle tech center and game store, big kids in grand
3939220	3942920	Rapids, Michigan, permanently closed pod tracker list.
3942920	3947560	These pods as being private and in control of the owner of the store.
3947560	3954480	So of the remaining ones, we have the fallout shelter arcade in twin cities, Minnesota met
3954480	3959720	core entertainment LLC in Houston, Texas and hanger 51 in Montreal.
3959720	3967920	So fallout has 12 met core has 18 and hanger has 10 and so, um, the last one I saw was
3967920	3977720	our Dave and busters in, um, Milpitas at the mall cause we would do my birthday every
3977720	3978720	year.
3978720	3979720	There'd be that.
3979720	3982000	And there'd be Derby owners club and then I would be really drunk and go, ah, Derby
3982000	3985040	owners club club is still, it's still there.
3985040	3988080	I think it's, Oh my God, it's been a while.
3988080	3989080	It's been a while.
3989080	3990720	Where are those all go?
3990720	3993480	Like seriously, like they're where all the horses go.
3993480	3996840	Oh no, there's one in San Francisco.
3996840	4003120	Um, cause when I went with JD to Dave and busters out further past, like closer to diamond,
4003120	4004120	where was it?
4004120	4005560	Diamond heights out that way further out.
4005560	4006560	Okay.
4006560	4007560	Yeah.
4007560	4010240	But anyway, um, but we played over there.
4010240	4013780	Um, I mean it was occupied and I didn't have my horses.
4013780	4015560	I do still have my horses.
4015560	4017560	Do you still have politics?
4017560	4018560	Oh God.
4018560	4026680	No, I, they, I threw them in the garbage, like the game in the, I still have Panda half.
4026680	4030640	I will say, because I know Bobby Black Wolf is probably shouting, he's probably shouting
4030640	4035200	in chat right now that he wants had an interview all about this game and what it's become with
4035200	4038640	the, you know, all these years later with the dragon con pods and all that.
4038640	4042800	So, um, I, I don't know what episode number off the top of my head, but I'm sure he will,
4042800	4045480	he will provide a link, but it was, it was a good interview and it's, if you want to
4045480	4048680	know more about this game and how it evolved in the state of it currently check it out.
4048680	4053160	There's a little bit more cause there was a battle tech animated series that was done
4053160	4062320	in that universe produced by Saban, but yeah, apparently there's also books and mech warriors,
4062320	4065040	I guess kind of related in the same series.
4065040	4073160	So that also means then that the battle tech stuff is exactly what I was playing in tabletop.
4073160	4074160	So cool.
4074160	4075160	There you go.
4075160	4076160	All right.
4076160	4080440	Again, get an eight player pre-owned Derby owners club for only $26,000 Oh, is that all
4080440	4091160	that's all and like a whole room or two of your house dark Sakura, do you need a bedroom?
4091160	4093960	Which do you want more a bedroom or a Derby owners club machine?
4093960	4102400	Do you realize my bed takes up one whole room, all the crap in my office, two computers,
4102400	4106360	a TV, a bunch of video game stuff and all my crafting supplies.
4106360	4110920	And then our game room, our legit game room that I probably could have put it in is taken
4110920	4113200	up by three pinball tables.
4113200	4116980	And we've got five more in the garage and four in the house.
4116980	4120120	She is not like, like, like this is not hyperbole.
4120120	4121600	This is, this is real.
4121600	4123260	Like I've been to this house.
4123260	4124260	They really are.
4124260	4125260	They have a room full of fucking people.
4125260	4129140	And one of the ones that my house isn't even mine, which you need to come play before it
4129140	4130140	gets reclaimed.
4130140	4131520	Cause it scared Steph.
4131520	4134680	Well, I'm going to be gone for a little bit, but do you think Sega would Sue me if I made
4134680	4138240	a game called Derpy owners club, Derpy owners club.
4138240	4143320	As long as it's full on parody, they can't under the rules of pair as long as it's parody.
4143320	4148400	I'll consider that table that now another Loki game got derailed because he had got
4148400	4149400	a better idea.
4149400	4153440	Derpy hooves is a copyright of Derpycon.
4153440	4154440	Not Derpy.
4154440	4157280	We'll just do all sorts of Derpy shit.
4157280	4158280	Okay.
4158280	4159280	All right.
4159280	4161520	Will you finish this one?
4161520	4164040	Oh yeah, of course.
4164600	4167480	He'll, he'll finish it more than he's finished any of the others.
4167480	4169000	No, I'm not going to start a new game.
4169000	4170280	I just thought that'd be a funny idea.
4170280	4174200	I have lots of really dumb ideas for games that like are just floating around out there
4174200	4175200	that haven't made yet.
4175200	4177960	Why don't we do that as a bonus episode?
4177960	4180840	Loki tells us about all his dumb ideas for games.
4180840	4183400	Give us one, give us one.
4183400	4188360	It would be like Pokemon go, but with roadkill and you would actually have to get like, so
4188360	4193860	it's not necessarily roadkill per se, but you'd be capturing animals that are just ordinary
4193860	4194860	animals.
4194860	4198340	So it's, it's not like, um, you know, like Pikachu and stuff.
4198340	4201700	It's like a squirrel, but we'd be calling them different things like trash pandas and
4201700	4202700	stuff like that.
4202700	4205540	And then you would level up your characters, um, in the game.
4205540	4209760	Like they have the little internet comics for a while where like they had like, uh,
4209760	4214100	it was like hamster fighting or whatever and they taped like knives to them and stuff like
4214100	4215100	that.
4215100	4218420	So it would be like that.
4218420	4222940	And also I thought about a total adult version of like animal crossing, but like, you know,
4222940	4224900	where you're selling crack and stuff like that on the street.
4224900	4231140	I think a lot of people have that, but the roadkill, but it's literally like, not really
4231140	4235380	rogue actual roadkill, but it wouldn't be like actual roadkill would be like hamsters
4235380	4236380	with claws.
4236380	4241380	It would just be like, you know, like, Oh, I encountered an animal or like a monster,
4241380	4244260	but it's just like, it's just an animal called something different.
4244260	4245260	You know?
4245260	4246260	Yes.
4246260	4247260	Yes.
4247260	4252580	Like danger noodles would be stuff like that.
4252580	4255980	But it would be done in like a hillbilly, like trailer park aesthetic.
4255980	4256980	Okay.
4256980	4257980	Okay.
4257980	4258980	That makes it better.
4258980	4259980	Yes.
4259980	4260980	There it is.
4260980	4262980	Your classic game of the week.
4262980	4271660	All right, anyway, uh, moving on, uh, let's travel around the world and check out some
4271660	4272660	release dates.
4272660	4277260	So we're going to try to cover kind of a long period here through, uh, our next live show
4277260	4278260	on the 15th.
4278260	4279260	All right.
4279500	4287420	So, um, we've got, uh, grand blue fantasy versus on PlayStation four IB and OB on Nintendo
4287420	4294660	switch murder by numbers on Nintendo switch and PC, uh, Pokemon mystery dungeon rescue
4294660	4302260	team DX on Nintendo switch, uh, Langrisser one and two on PC, Nintendo switch and PlayStation
4302260	4303260	four.
4304260	4312580	Um, let's see Orian, the will of the wisps on PC and Xbox one dead or school by on PlayStation
4312580	4319980	four, my hero one just, or one's justice to that's on PC, Nintendo switch PlayStation
4319980	4322480	four and Xbox one.
4322480	4325940	And last but not least Neo two on PlayStation four.
4325940	4326940	All right.
4326940	4328560	Heading over to Japan.
4328560	4334280	Let's check out switch releases for March 6th, which include a Pokemon Fushigi no dungeon.
4334280	4336360	That is obviously their version of mystery dungeon.
4336360	4339140	So that is out in Japan as well on the sixth.
4339140	4341000	And then also coming out in Japan.
4341000	4345320	Um, I think that's actually the only release on that particular day.
4345320	4353840	So jumping ahead to March the 12th, we have a human resource machine, deluxe toe our way.
4353840	4359240	Uh, no Palm refrain and color cross malice for Nintendo switch.
4359240	4366160	I guess that's, um, probably some type of, uh, uh, anime or, or manga or something.
4366160	4370920	Uh, but speaking of, if you're into the horsey games, winning post nine 2020 is also out
4370920	4373080	on the switch, uh, on March 12th.
4373080	4374540	So you have that to look forward to.
4374540	4377680	So if you're, if you're missing your Derby owners club, you always have winning post
4377680	4382680	to look forward to, uh, checking out the PlayStation four to see what the big releases are there.
4382680	4384760	You know, I don't see anything that early, early March.
4384760	4388260	I don't really start seeing releases till March 12th where winning post nine is also
4388260	4389760	out on the PlayStation four.
4389760	4393320	Um, Kondagawa jet girls is out as well.

4408840	4409840	Cause sure.
4409840	4410840	Yeah.
4410840	4411840	Yeah.
4412000	4418200	Cause there's a bunch on the 27th, but yeah, anyway, but that already happened.
4418200	4419200	Yeah, sure.
4419200	4420200	It did.
4420200	4425880	So on the fifth we have Carly and the Reaper man, which sounds like a fun game, uh, escape
4425880	4426880	from the underworld.
4426880	4433360	Um, also on the fifth we have Pokemon mysterious dungeon rescue team DX Ori and the will of
4433360	4438560	the wis on the 10th on the 11th we have overpass on the 12th we have bleeding edge beta.

4448480	4458480	That's uh, from the, my hero academia, um, uh, Neil, uh, two on, uh, March, uh, 12th.
4458480	4462400	And on the 16th we have remnant from the ashes.
4462400	4467000	I might've gone too far, but I don't care.
4467000	4468000	All right.
4468440	4473840	I might add the week after we do our next show, animal crossing will become, I know
4473840	4474840	it's almost here.
4474840	4475840	It's exciting.
4475840	4476840	Mm hmm.
4476840	4477840	Exciting stuff.
4477840	4478840	Three weeks away.
4478840	4479840	I needs.
4479840	4480840	All right.
4480840	4484560	Well, uh, that's about going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio, but
4484560	4485560	here's here.
4485560	4490800	So I was just texted this by a friend of mine, apparently, uh, the first us coronavirus case
4490800	4495680	of unknown origin just confirmed in Northern California.
4495680	4500280	And I guess it's the individual is a resident of Solano County and is receiving medical
4500280	4501440	care in Sacramento County.
4501440	4503480	I thought there was the one that came back from Japan.
4503480	4504480	Yeah.
4504480	4508960	There's a Korean lady now going around Southern California in Korea town that turned out she
4508960	4509960	is infected.
4509960	4510960	Huh?
4510960	4513880	The individual had no known exposure to the virus through travel or close contact with
4513880	4514880	a known infected individual.
4514880	4518800	Oh, but it's like I said, they already confirmed that it was airborne.
4518800	4519800	Yeah.
4519800	4520800	So fun.
4520800	4524440	Well, I hope they in contact with Corona's.
4524440	4525440	I blame that.
4525440	4527240	I hope I get to go on my cruise.
4527240	4528240	All right.
4528240	4533800	So, so that means that I am going to go buy some more lysine and do things that boost
4533800	4535120	up my immune system.
4535120	4540000	But the people I'm more worried for are my friends who are immunocompromised, you know,
4540000	4546160	my friend's child, a couple of friends of mine dealing with AIDS and HIV, elderly individuals,
4546160	4547160	elderly.
4547160	4548160	Yeah.
4548160	4551640	Um, just do the things that will boost your immune system.
4551640	4558280	Don't be stupid, but do the things that are, just be intelligent about it.
4558280	4559280	Yeah.
4559280	4561200	Take, take normal precautions.
4561200	4566640	Don't go around with a gas mask, you know, if you are immunocompromised, it might not
4566640	4573680	be beyond the scope of reason to have maybe a, an N5 or N95.
4573680	4581600	But again, be smart and learn how to fucking wash your goddamn hands the right way.
4581600	4583200	Not just a little water.
4583200	4593120	You have to scrub your hands and get in your nails and up at least past your wrist bone
4593120	4595640	to be considered having properly washed your hands.
4595640	4598920	And you sing happy birthday twice.
4598920	4599920	Yes.
4599920	4600920	All right.
4600920	4606800	So, and, and, and what do not touch blood or bodily fluid?
4606800	4613340	I'm just saying because, well, it's just, oh, I'm probably going to be renewing my first
4613340	4615800	aid cert in the light of all this.
4615800	4616800	So.
4616800	4617800	All right.
4617800	4622120	Well, to practice good hygiene, everybody, uh, we're going to wrap up final thoughts.
4622120	4625480	Uh, thank you guys for tuning into this special episode of orange launch radio.
4625480	4628560	Um, especially since, you know, we're, I'm out of town for a couple of weeks.
4628560	4630440	Uh, we are planning to be back on March 15th.
4630440	4631840	I guess I have to phrase it that way.
4631840	4636240	Now we're planning to be back on March 15th, um, live over at vognetwork.com.
4636240	4640360	So we really hope to see you guys then, uh, but otherwise it's time to wrap things up.
4640360	4641360	We're done here for the week.
4641360	4644720	So, um, if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange on radio, please tell a friend or
4644720	4645720	two about the show.
4645720	4648080	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has voice, but if the
4648080	4651080	voices aren't here to put out on air, then what are we going to do?
4651080	4659760	So, um, also very important to say, uh, that, um, uh, uh, sharing the show, uh, hosting
4659760	4662440	on Twitch, all of that stuff goes a long way.
4662440	4665880	We'll have a very, uh, long episode probably on March 15th to catch up on everything we
4665880	4669240	missed because I'm sure there's going to be a lot between GDC and packs and everything
4669240	4670240	else.
4670240	4671240	Uh, it's going to be something.
4671240	4674400	I hope you guys will still be checking out Bobby Black Wolf and other independent podcasts
4674400	4678400	on not just at vognetwork.com, but all up and down the wonderful interwebs.
4678400	4680080	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
4680080	4681080	Dark Sakura.
4681080	4684160	Um, I don't know.
4684160	4686680	My brain is mushy.
4686680	4687680	It's mushy.
4688160	4692320	My appropriate final thought for tonight would be live long and prosper.
4692320	4694120	Loki, your final thought.
4694120	4699800	Uh, my final thought is that, um, I don't know.
4699800	4700800	I don't have anything.
4700800	4701800	I'm tired.
4701800	4702800	That's it.
4702800	4708000	On that note, rest up, play some games, make your, make your, uh, some more Minecraft cause
4708000	4709000	that's mindless.
4709000	4712560	Ooh, actually I was literally about to hit the credits button.
4712560	4713560	Dark Sakura.
4713560	4714920	Well, it's just a little thing.
4714920	4717040	Bob, Bob Iger stepped down as Disney CEO.
4717040	4718520	I haven't yesterday.
4718520	4719520	It was just posted today.
4719520	4720520	So sorry.
4720520	4721520	That's all right.
4721520	4722520	Okay.
4722520	4725940	GameStop will give you $5 a month if you do their pro subscription cause they're desperate
4725940	4726940	for business.
4726940	4729040	Do I have permission to end the goddamn show?
4729040	4730040	Maybe.
4730040	4731040	Yes.
