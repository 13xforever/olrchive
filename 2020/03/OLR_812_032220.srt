00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,960
This week Doom Eternal isn't in the show role but it has to be mentioned that it's

2
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,560
a fantastic game and it's load times are incredible.

3
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,500
This is what I wanted to say, stay tuned for your host stories of the week starting right

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,960
Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,320
and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice it is Orange

7
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:47,200
Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 812 for this March the 22nd of 2020.

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,260
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined in studio by Captain Pikachu at my side so here's what's

9
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,260
going on.

10
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,500
This is a little different for Orange Lounge Radio tonight even though I am here in studio

11
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,680
N7 because if you haven't figured it out by now studio N7 is at my house so I'm here.

12
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,400
My co-host tonight we're doing a little bit of social distancing as many folks out there

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,440
in the world are doing because it's the right thing to do to help slow the spread of this

14
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,560
horrible thing that's going around that's really you know affecting us all and affecting

15
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,560
our world right now.

16
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,180
So I am joined though thanks to the magic of discord I am joined tonight by of course

17
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,840
DarkSakura or Jamie Summers should be there.

18
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:27,880
Hi.

19
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,880
Hi how are you?

20
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,140
Um I had a flare-up but um hopefully healing so we'll see.

21
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:41,240
Now as a follow-up to last week you found out that you have pneumonia and not the big

22
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,040
C right?

23
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:50,460
That's what she said but um I just finished my antibiotics and um I had a flare-up last

24
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:57,080
night so I don't know um what's going on but I was I had a couple days with no fever

25
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:04,200
and then I started running a fever again last night running a fever today so we'll see.

26
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,100
Well my fingers and toes and I'm sure all of us are crossed that uh everything is gonna

27
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,760
go just fine with your recovery it's it's one of those really weird kind of uh states

28
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:19,360
of the world in 2020 where we're sitting here going yay it's just pneumonia when that's

29
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,300
actually not particularly a great thing to be talking about so but um in all seriousness

30
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,320
thank you for being here tonight um despite how you're feeling um but I mean I've relatively

31
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,460
is your energy's been there you've been able to play games and do stuff around the house?

32
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:40,740
Well that not that that requires a whole lot of uh energy but um I've uh I've been playing

33
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:47,740
a lot of a lot of stuff on my switch you know what I'm playing and I baked bread which wasn't

34
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:53,240
the best idea but it was delicious. Well hey it's uh hard to find bread at some of the

35
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,720
stores right now so I'm I hear a lot of people yeah I hear a lot of people are kind of baking

36
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,600
right now um speaking of baking uh also joining us tonight via discord I believe should be

37
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,320
there is Techmaster Loki. I'm not baking anything. I thought I thought you said something about

38
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,840
the air fryer before we went live. Oh oh no that that's yeah that's Nellie cooking dinner

39
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,240
I'm sure it's like some Asian or something. Gotcha okay so again um this is a little new

40
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,180
for us uh here at Orange Launch Radio you know we started this show back in 2002 if

41
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:28,980
you were unaware and um you know in that year we didn't really have you know when we started

42
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,720
this whole thing on the Live 365 network we were dial-up friendly radios so that was the

43
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,980
way many people were still connecting to the internet so we didn't have things like Skype

44
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,520
and you know all that there was no iPhone yet or any type of smartphone really at that

45
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:46,340
point um and so we kind of got used to doing this show in the same room um and that's kind

46
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,980
of where this show you know and when people ask like well it makes you different than

47
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,760
other gaming podcasts I can talk about how long we've been around but also I think part

48
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,800
of what makes us a little bit different is that uh we are usually all in the same room

49
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,880
so we can kind of play off each other and all that stuff um but obviously as you guys

50
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,900
know being in the same room is not really an option right now I mean I guess technically

51
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,160
the whole stay at home thing would allow like six people to get together but the reality

52
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,420
is um if you can practice social distancing you should so we're setting an example I hope

53
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,980
tonight by doing things a little differently but therefore my point with that is the audio

54
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,900
quality may not be quite what you're used to so you'll have to forgive us a little bit

55
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:30,580
um but you know we had to kind of throw things together as they say uh to make tonight's

56
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,360
show happen uh thanks to the magic of discord so um but of course if you do want to join

57
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,280
us live you can we do tape live every sunday night at the voice geeks network twitch.tv

58
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,680
slash vog network we're on at 6 p.m pacific nine o'clock eastern right after the bobby

59
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,320
black wolf show um again that's over twitch.tv slash vog network and yes bobby does have

60
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,960
a good point here um bobby says podcasts are technically exempt from the shelter in place

61
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,640
ruling at least in los angeles county but I wouldn't expect a gaming podcast to risk

62
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:06,340
that and yeah it's one of those things where it's like you know if um if maybe our podcast

63
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:12,200
was uh spreading awareness about disease prevention or was like a news-based podcast or something

64
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,040
a little more like you know uh traditional media I suppose where there's a benefit for

65
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,960
us all being in the same room or out in the field reporting so to speak then yeah we could

66
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,960
bend the rules a little bit but since you know we I've heard that we're an essential

67
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,280
podcast though so it's fine we can skirt by all of the laws because of that we are

68
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,600
an essential podcast I've I believe that's that's the rule that we're setting orange

69
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,880
launch radio essential podcasting uh so well okay funny you bring that up because obviously

70
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,920
that's going to tie into tonight's kickoff topic which I'm sure is on a lot of people's

71
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,880
minds uh this week as they've been reading all the updates with what's going on in the

72
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,000
world um dark sakura why don't you start us off because I know you had some thoughts when

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:05,080
it came to this topic um well um it's uh I have friends that work there number one

74
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,120
and one of my friends flat out told me when I was talking about picking up my pre-order

75
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,760
because I had actually switched it to her store um is that um I should just not pick

76
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:22,300
up my game and get it digitally or from somewhere else um after having talked to her she was

77
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:28,260
like yeah and was linking me to all these other people they were telling you know their

78
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:33,100
the press release at game stop was saying that they were sending cleaning material and

79
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,580
hand sanitizer to all the stores which was a lie they were telling the managers to go

80
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:42,420
get them and of course where are they there's none to be found and they were having to pay

81
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:49,580
for it out of pocket so um and they were telling people to go home if they were sick but they

82
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:55,180
were calling people in while they were sick because they didn't have enough people to

83
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:01,220
watch the desk or anything like that to keep the store open so um you know it was it was

84
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:08,380
really terrible um and then of course it was putting longer hours on the people who were

85
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:15,520
okay to work and you know and then on top of that they're endangering people by having

86
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:23,600
people come in by not maintaining um any type of proper social distancing and so um and on top

87
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,320
of that they're not a freaking essential business I'm sorry well I'm not sorry because they're not

88
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,160
yeah and it sounds like you know it's interesting because you know we've taught and I've mentioned

89
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,640
this on the show and I'm sure we have folks that work at GameStop stores that listen to this show

90
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:42,160
and I hope you all understand the issues that we've taken up with you know the evil G or whatever

91
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,680
you want to call it over the years has nothing to do with the hard-working folks at the stores

92
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:54,080
or even the store managers it's and and I think nothing has ever made this more apparent than

93
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,760
this particular story we're talking about now with what's going on with COVID is that you know

94
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,960
and you mentioned like you're being told under the table essentially by employees like yo don't come

95
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,360
in here because what they're telling you isn't the reality of what's going on they're not saying

96
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,320
and I mean that is a huge disconnect when the corporate is saying oh yeah we're we're sending

97
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,800
out sanitizer and all that really cuz we're all having a hard time finding it but okay but we're

98
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,540
gonna go make our so they're saying they're sending it all out but that's not true they're

99
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,640
making the store managers as if they didn't have to go through enough go out and find this stuff

100
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:31,680
when we all know we all have a television that or radio or whatever you use we all know that you

101
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,640
can't find that stuff right now so to say that these stores are all stock to that is is untrue

102
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:45,000
and it's it's it's really irresponsible and I I suppose you could make a stretch argument that

103
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,960
maybe GameStop deals somewhat in computing supplies and those computing supplies would

104
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:56,720
be important to teleworkers but let's be real that's not what GameStop was selling on Friday

105
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,240
night GameStop was selling all those pre-orders of Animal Crossing and Doom Eternal that they

106
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,440
wanted to keep those sales on and I think that was pretty apparent and what was going on yeah

107
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:16,960
they it's really you know and not to go on too much of the political side of things but you know

108
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:24,680
we're we're watching the crumbling of capitalism right now because people are trying to first of

109
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:30,920
all you know make a profit at the expense of other people that that's really how I see it you know I

110
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:37,800
mean but on top of that though with so many businesses closing down it's really people

111
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,280
don't have a way of bringing in the money and people aren't going out and spending it either

112
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:47,720
so I you know I you can't blame I'm equal you can't blame them but but in the same run when

113
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,760
your company is at the core of itself in the business to make money it doesn't really feel

114
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,400
responsible to the public that comes out right then and there in in the public so yeah and I

115
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:06,640
think I think you can definitely you know still say like you know without being political I think

116
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,800
there's definitely going to be a conversation around all there's gonna be conversation about

117
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,280
people being able to stay home sick when they're actually sick there's gonna be a conversation

118
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,200
about you know being able to access health care and getting health care needs and whether that

119
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,640
should be tied to having a job or not and you know now I don't know what the answer is to that

120
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:31,720
some folks will be you know with Bernie on that some folks will be with more middle-ground Democrats

121
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,560
on that some people will be with Trump or possibly Mitt Romney or other Republicans on that because

122
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,160
there's all sorts of different answers out there but I think a conversation will certainly be had

123
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:47,000
certainly be had especially just real quick sorry especially with the I guess this would be

124
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,640
appropriate use of the term she's in Freud where you have you know the one senator who voted

125
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,480
against the one of the stimulus packages has now come down with coronavirus I mean the fact that

126
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,960
this is now on Washington DC's doorstep literally and cannot be ignored no matter how you feel about

127
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,920
that politician or any of that stuff the fact that is on their doorstep and cannot be ignored

128
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,040
that is going to cause a conversation to happen if nothing else I will point this out though that

129
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:24,760
right now Bernie did take his campaign resources and immediately filtered it into providing

130
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:36,160
services to people who are ill jobless and to fighting the the spread of the disease I hope

131
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,960
we see all of Washington DC follow suit very soon it is you haven't seen Biden do it we have

132
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:47,520
definitely seen a lot of companies that are really stepping up to be able to like I saw one going on

133
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,800
Twitter and I apologize I forget the name of the company in the moment they're coming up and making

134
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,440
masks Oh Christian Siriano the fashion designer famous from Project Runway is starting to make

135
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,400
more masks for you know New York and and because there's obviously a big outbreak there and so

136
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,320
forth so I think you're definitely gonna see and to tie this back to video games you're definitely

137
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,280
starting to see when it comes to the corporations who the people are that are stepping up right and

138
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:15,280
who the people are that are slipping down and GameStop is one of those companies that's slipping

139
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:21,480
down because of all this at a time when GameStop needs not to be slipping down and again I feel for

140
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:27,400
a lot of those people on the front lines and so forth because these bad decisions are not theirs

141
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:33,440
but it's making everybody a GameStop look bad and it's it's really unfortunate and I got two words

142
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,800
hostile takeover and I know a lot of people are talking maybe Reggie will come in there and

143
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:45,120
reminder Reggie has nothing to do with this if you go back and listen there go go Google News

144
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,640
search the Reggie thing and his thing about joining GameStop that's not effective until

145
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:57,560
mid-april so Reggie has nothing to do with any of this in fact he might reverse decision as a result

146
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:04,920
I don't know the contracts may already be signed I don't know but the reality is Reggie's gonna be

147
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,040
walking into something big but again he's not gonna be the CEO he's gonna be a member of the

148
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:15,440
board but I don't know if he's gonna necessarily be the hero that everybody hopes he is but we

149
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,400
hope there is a hero at GameStop or that comes in and buys them or something and turns them around

150
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:29,200
I think so anyway Loki I don't know if you had some other things you wanted to add to this I

151
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,280
know you've been following a lot of what's going around with GameStop right yeah so there was quite

152
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,200
a few stories like cuz the whole thing was kind of developing over the week so you first you had

153
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,760
of course what Jamie alluded to where there was the memos going out to store saying that they're

154
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,040
going to be providing them with you know disinfectant supplies and you basically stuff to

155
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:55,240
kind of stave off some of the germs and everything that might be there you know kind of the same

156
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:02,520
message a lot of different locations were saying and then there was the whole recommendation that

157
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:10,320
they should close you know non-essential retailers and then of course GameStop making the argument

158
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:20,000
that well we are essential retail and we're going to you know fight that order and basically the

159
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,840
employees just not even happy with that at all I mean just very much against it a lot of folks

160
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:32,160
quitting over this but it's almost like they suddenly unionized they didn't say that word

161
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,480
but you know when everybody kind of bands together to do the it's interesting it's very interesting

162
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,480
oh yeah absolutely and then and then what was kind of crazy too is along the same time there

163
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:51,000
was this one youtuber that leaked a call with the executives is one of the GameStop calls that they

164
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,280
had talking about the whole situation and everything and that did not sound well because there's a lot

165
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:02,000
of concerned employees that were basically asking me hey what's gonna happen you know you're telling

166
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,360
us to come in and you know we're not gonna get paid if we take time off or whatever you know I

167
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,240
don't want to be exposed to this I'm you know living with my elderly grandma I I don't want to

168
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,440
expose her to kovin 19 and you know they didn't really have much a response other than well we're

169
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,200
taking a day at a time and that type of stuff and then kind of funny you know after a whole

170
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:29,240
California you know officially you know say okay you guys have to all close finally then did they

171
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:35,960
actually close their doors but before that you know obviously you could tell what the goal was

172
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,920
because they were putting out their pre-orders for both Animal Crossing and Doom Eternal early

173
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:47,800
and then you know some of the follow-up with that it sounds like that finally the CEO is gonna give

174
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:54,480
them some paid time off and some compensation for coming in on these days and then I did find that

175
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,600
one funny screenshot where they in Pennsylvania they've yanked their business license at least so

176
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,040
that was kind of interesting is that is that proven because that I saw that I think we all

177
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,200
many of us saw that picture of the printout that was on the door or something but that didn't look

178
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,600
very official to me like it looked like especially something that would use aerial black like that

179
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,120
that's just a very it just looked whipped up I don't know word I just yeah I don't know be a

180
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,280
little bit you guys and maybe I'm wrong it may have been an official thing because it was whipped

181
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:28,360
up quickly but I don't think there's anything wrong with you have a healthy healthy dose of

182
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,840
skepticism with all this crazy amount of news that's coming out about you know the the COVID

183
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:40,960
and all that yeah so here's they have they did send out a letter to from the CEO George Sherman

184
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:46,840
sent out to all of the associates basically saying that effective immediately we've implemented the

185
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,440
following for hourly associates that work at source that close or close in the future as a

186
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:57,720
result of COVID-19 any associate directly impacted by COVID-19 at work is required to quarantine

187
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:04,800
hourly employees who are paid time or have PTO are eligible will receive 80 hours of additional

188
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:11,800
PTO in the event that you're not to PTO eligible you'll be paying for we will be paying you for two

189
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,720
additional weeks of base pay calculated by the weekly average number hours you work in addition

190
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,000
if your full-time benefit eligible employee will be receiving reimbursement for one month

191
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
of employee benefit contributions for the month of April so at least that's something yeah a little

192
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,160
after like dragging them through the street screaming I mean we'll give them we'll give them

193
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,960
light snaps on a little light snaps and and still you know question some of the decisions I do want

194
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,160
to address what's the discussion happening in the chat room because Tiger Claw is mentioning I posted

195
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,920
a screenshot of the notice and has a picture of the notice but you know respectfully Tiger Claw

196
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,680
I realize that's what a lot of people are looking at because I saw the reddit post and everything

197
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:56,120
but I actually question that thing's legitimacy and I'm gonna tell you what it is for me there's

198
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,920
no wet signature on that and that means that it's been signed I would think any type of actual order

199
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,840
to close a business I'm pretty much sure anytime I've ever seen that posted in the window has a

200
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:14,840
signature from either a sheriff who served it or a judge or the county's like there's no signature

201
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,400
on there and I'm sorry that's again a healthy dose of skepticism I'm not necessarily saying it's all

202
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,480
bullshit but then Bobby says there's literally no official news sources that say Pennsylvania

203
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,720
revoked their business license the governor of Pennsylvania did have harsh words but did not

204
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:36,240
take that action and so yeah so I actually I don't think a GameStop was officially closed now did an

205
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,080
employee now I'm not saying the sign didn't exist because did an employee whip up that sign because

206
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,240
they didn't want to go to work that day and felt unsafe there but possibly there's a lot

207
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:53,680
of that's absolutely possible but there's a lot of explanations out there not necessarily the one

208
00:18:53,680 --> 00:19:00,080
that read it's telling you and I think keep that in mind and it's it's very easy to fall for these

209
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,200
types of things in this day and age on the internet the other one I'm hearing is not true and I haven't

210
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,960
done my own research on this but you know there's the stories going around about how the Venice

211
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,800
canals like dolphins and fish are swimming in the canal apparently that one's not true and so

212
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:23,680
interesting so just be careful about all the news that goes around right now it's a tricky time you

213
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:29,920
know there should always be a way to like double source something if you're seeing it from one

214
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,200
source hmm especially if that source is read it if you've seen it from two sources especially if

215
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:40,560
one of them is CNN NBC CBS heck Fox I'll allow it when it comes to figuring out if something's

216
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:47,880
legitimate or not in a double validation sort of thing double validate it that's all I'm saying so

217
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:56,680
anyway okay and yeah some folks are saying s200 Matt says no state source would recommend people

218
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,120
wear and n95 masks are telling people not to buy those masks because there's a shortage and

219
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:08,880
healthcare people need those yeah so anyway just I'm gonna throw in something yeah just because I

220
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,280
used to do property inspections for commercial properties oh yeah back in the day I remember

221
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:19,240
that yeah that sign really isn't too far-fetched to me first of all a lot of those offices are not

222
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:26,400
on max the standard font is aerial at least a lot of them have an upgraded computers and things like

223
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:35,560
that what does give me a little bit of pause is that the way the the extra text on it and on top

224
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:42,200
of that the fact that it looks like it's cut off but those actually are fairly in line with

225
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:51,600
condemnation images like that I linked one from the city of Baltimore now there's are in like a

226
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:58,280
bright yellow I have seen them in white I have seen them just a piece but just a letter written

227
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:07,600
on business head it really is going to vary from place to place and I am suspect of it simply

228
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:15,720
because it is cut off at the bottom I would have expected to have had like you know a professional

229
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:21,920
letter something on cardstock too or at least a heavy paper but I'm not saying I'm I'm saying

230
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:29,880
that font typography choice what have you that actually is not far-fetched but no no signature

231
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,960
required that's the thing that's hanging me up I've seen some that have signatures I've seen

232
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:41,440
others that don't a lot of them will have like contact you know X for for that and but usually

233
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,600
they will say let me go back and look at it the biggest thing that they're gonna say is

234
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:56,880
the nature of the closure this doesn't give any of it and again with that being cut off it actually

235
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:03,760
looks like it's more of a photocopy of something so those are the things that make me think it's

236
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,440
not legitimate not necessarily how it's laid out all right analyzing the receipts with dark

237
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:20,880
Sakura you should seriously consider I mean now is the time to start thinking about those side

238
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,360
projects and podcasts you always wanted to do because all of us have a lot of free time all

239
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,680
of a sudden you should I would love to see you do a show called like analyzing the receipts where

240
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,360
you take like big reddit stories and Facebook shares and try to figure out if they're BS or

241
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,280
not although I suppose that's kind of like double double doing what Snopes does but you know I don't

242
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,440
think Snopes has the time for this type of thing like they don't care about this one little Game

243
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:48,760
Stop in Pennsylvania actually funny that you mentioned that Snopes has a big letter on their

244
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:54,080
main page looking for a donation so they can keep up what they're doing because they've been

245
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:04,760
inundated with so I would say people can help Snopes out this is a really important time for

246
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:10,040
us to make sure we have factual information going out and this isn't the time to be posting

247
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:17,240
stuff oh well it was funny or oh it sounded like it could have been right fact check every fucking

248
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:23,800
thing before you post it because lives depend on yeah be very careful right now in social media

249
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:31,120
there's so much there's so much going around all right I will absolutely call you out Loki we we

250
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,840
we've got off base a little bit I don't know if there was anything else you want to add to the

251
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:40,000
GameStop saga no that's pretty much it they said that the stores that are gonna remain open which

252
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:47,840
I can't imagine that's gonna be for very long are doing my guess I guess you can pick up at the door

253
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:54,080
type of stuff where you can order through the app I mean do people really need physical games that

254
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,960
badly I don't know well Bobby shared a story about Animal Crossing and how you can't share

255
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,160
a digital copy so if him and his wife will both want to play it makes more sense for them to have

256
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:09,080
a physical copy so like I kind of get those types of scenarios and you know I I we've talked we've

257
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,200
had the digital versus physical debate here on this show before some people just prefer to have

258
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,880
something tangible that they can eventually sell back since you know GameStop is kind of in that

259
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:24,440
business but long story short the the whole drive up solution I think is is a fair compromise and

260
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,280
probably what should have been implemented in the first place interestingly enough they're not the

261
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,520
only business to be doing something like that I believe Best Buy is starting something like that

262
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:38,600
very soon which you know now even more so with Best Buy yes I could see where Best Buy is very

263
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,200
important right now with so many people or in stores like it I don't want to give them free

264
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,600
advertising but electronic stores will say in general because with so many people working from

265
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:53,800
home you have what if what if a monitor goes bad what if a power cord or you got to replace a surge

266
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:58,160
protector things like that that makes a lot more sense you got to drive up and and to be fair

267
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:04,120
GameStop has a limited amount but they do have some of those things I guess so what if I don't

268
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:09,640
have my Funko pops and they can't work but yeah the one of my desk just fell over but anyway um

269
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:14,320
yeah like the drive-up thing makes a lot more sense um Allen actually just went out to get

270
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:20,920
pet food because not only do we have to eat but mr. smoosh has to eat and mr. smoosh because if

271
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,240
you guys have seen him which if you watch live on twitch he's always there at the beginning of the

272
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,840
show you see that his face is smoosh it's actually not why we call him that we call him mr. smoosh

273
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,760
because when you put out your hand for him to like lick your finger or something he will just ram

274
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,720
his whole face into your hand he smooshes his face in your hands that's why we call mr. smoosh

275
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:43,000
but he does have a smoosh face so he doesn't really have much of a nose so we have to buy a

276
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,400
very specific type of pet food for him that is very smelly we have to buy like very smelly fish

277
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,560
cat food or else he doesn't know he doesn't recognize that it's food really so we go to

278
00:25:54,560 --> 00:26:00,200
a specialty pet food store and that's what they do he Allen drives up in the car basically and

279
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:06,800
I think he did walk up to a table and they went in the store got it brought it out rung it up

280
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:13,160
hand sanitizer for both of them right outside and on to the next person that comes up so this whole

281
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:18,040
concept of like drive up get what you need and leave is being implemented in other places as

282
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:28,280
well not just what what GameStop's got going on also things to point out here Bobby Blackwell

283
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:33,560
pointing out Best Buy also sells kitchen appliances so they're a little more essential I didn't think

284
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,080
about that what if I mean what if the fridge breaks down during this whole thing or the

285
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:41,720
freezer you know you got you got to worry about that but they aren't doing in-home delivery of

286
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,080
those appliances they'll drop the new fridge at your front door and tell you good luck yikes

287
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,240
that's gonna make it a little more difficult but nothing a good old YouTube search can't solve

288
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:57,320
hopefully when it comes to installing anything you can find it on YouTube somewhere I'm sure so

289
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:04,080
anyway yeah lots of lots of crazy changes that are gonna be happening and you know crossing our

290
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:10,680
fingers and toes that we're talking about weeks and not months but be prepared for anything the

291
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:16,520
official statement is eight to ten weeks yeah it could it could be some time so and we're seeing

292
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:21,920
a lot of stuff as far out as May getting cancelled even some June I mean we know about e3 and so

293
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:31,120
forth but I just saw today Portland retro Expo got cancelled and they were in I actually think

294
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,400
I feel like they're all the way out in like July or August but they're more concerned about well

295
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:42,800
they can't predict the future and what's gonna go on but also be just the fact that you know with

296
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:48,280
all this going on the economic impact of the small businesses that the retro convention tends to you

297
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,600
know attract and things like that like it's just so hard to know so there's there's events all

298
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,760
summer that are starting to get cancelled dark soccer you post on Facebook the California

299
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,760
pinball thing got cancelled too and that was during the summer right Golden State pinball

300
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:08,880
it's in May and actually I was just I saw something go up that says a bay is considering

301
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:16,240
postponing the Olympics in Japan yeah so that's tragic Jamie I mean where are you gonna go to play

302
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:27,960
pinball now that still but also some of the events for the sisters were cancelled our Easter thing

303
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:36,960
well they said postponed pride and I think LA is getting no not la Placerville I think one of them

304
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,960
is getting you're right la la is got cancelled straight out a couple other places I have moved

305
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:50,640
there so August Davis did Davis did that's it so yeah it's just a lot of a lot of stuff going on

306
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,760
so you know fingers and toes crossed the Dragon Con still happens but I'm trying to mentally

307
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:02,000
prepare myself for the fact that it might not but I'm trying to be optimistic and you know I know

308
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,440
there's other optimistic folks out there so I'm trying to stay that weapon of just preparing

309
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,880
myself for that possibility is you know it just might be the case we were gonna be doing a live

310
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,720
showing of clue in April obviously that got pushed back it got pushed back to June I'm getting

311
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:21,640
worried it's gonna get pushed back again but if that's what it takes to save people especially

312
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:27,640
elderly folks and so forth then it's it's what we got to do so all right well one thing I'm

313
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,720
sure we're all doing right now in this time is playing a lot of video games to get by so let's

314
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,280
talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week and we'll

315
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:41,120
start with dark soccer as if I had any question whatsoever as to what she's been playing this

316
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:49,840
week sorry I've been muting my mic as I have to cough a lot no you're fine well it's been

317
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,880
Animal Crossing I keep forgetting to look at pocket camp even I might even just quit playing

318
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:08,000
it but I am really enjoying New Horizons I am on my third loan starting tomorrow and I should be

319
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,960
able to save up everything to pay it off tonight I I've already recruited new new villagers to move

320
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:23,600
in a place their houses and actually trying to get furniture for one of the houses now it adds a lot

321
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,720
more to the game I think with all of these kind of fetch quest II things if that makes sense sure

322
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:37,320
but but I streamed my first day playing I finally got my audio to work for one whole stream I joined

323
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:45,920
your stream justice you were saying good night I ended up just being really really exhausted and

324
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:51,280
it was I was sitting in a folding chair because it's kind of a crappy setup I have where I had

325
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:56,440
my MacBook with that elgato plugged into it but for some reason the switch doesn't do the output

326
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:07,040
to TV and to my Mac at the same time so I'm only getting audio on on the capture HD app so up to

327
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:12,440
date everything I've done all my troubleshooting OBS doesn't work with it at all hmm yeah so I

328
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,320
haven't it just doesn't even detect the the card and I've done of course all the troubleshooting I

329
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:25,520
have no excuse not to know how to do it so if it happens again I might have to rethink how I'm

330
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:37,480
doing it but yeah I played how many I started it at 9 and played until 3 a.m. and then yesterday

331
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:44,800
I played for 10 hours no Friday I paid played for 10 hours yesterday I played for about six

332
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:51,240
hours but I started getting so ill that I had to lay down and today I played for a couple and then

333
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:56,200
I took a nap and now I'm doing the show wow you're making me you're making me look like a filthy

334
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,360
casual I haven't even opened the game yet today I'm supposed to I'm supposed to get my museum

335
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:06,680
finally today I'm so behind like I haven't even found the nuggets to get the store yet I should

336
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,880
have them tonight if I play if I play a little bit after the show which I probably will I should

337
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:20,960
have the nuggets tonight are you going to the the island I went to one island but I was saving my

338
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,920
nook points to get the inventory expansion and the tool the tool act the circular tool access thing

339
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:35,120
because those sounded very important and then I just barely got another 2,000 miles but I was like

340
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,000
oh I should save these because maybe when I pay off the loan it's gonna open up even more inventory

341
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,600
space or something but keep in mind by opening the museum and all the other things you get many

342
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,560
many more nook miles I've been spending them like like they're going out of like they're

343
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:58,640
going out of fashion okay and I still have 13,000 look miles right now so what do you think of the

344
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,800
new Animal Crossing game compared to the old ones this one has a lot more to do with it by the way

345
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:10,880
let me continue one other thing sorry get your first get your first loan oh yeah already work

346
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:18,040
I already have the house okay good because what you get those extra five items on top of your nook

347
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:26,120
miles app yeah those give you miles like for doing basic shit yeah the little dailies I call

348
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:31,800
them dailies even though they just kind of keep going but yeah I've cycled through 30 of them in

349
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:37,160
a day but that if this is one of the new things that this new Animal Crossing game kind of brings

350
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:41,800
in that the old ones didn't have is that you have like these you know daily quests but then

351
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:46,640
once you finish them little other short quests kind of pop in so this was a mechanism and you

352
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,320
get these nook miles which are not the same thing as currency but you can use them to get either the

353
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,280
trips to the random island or I think they have like hairstyles shirts there's certain things that

354
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:01,040
are tied I've unlocked all the hairstyles half the clothes are ugly but I did get a leaf rug

355
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:11,960
and I got the umbrella I you also if you check the terminal every day you get nook miles if you

356
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:18,840
you also every so often get achievements for just buying regular stuff so the the store changes

357
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:26,440
daily not just with Tommy but in the the kiosk and did you find where to buy the other recipes

358
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:34,040
from Tommy I think which which recipes if you talk to him to buy something you hit your R trigger

359
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:42,880
and it gives you another thing to buy like basic items yeah I think I did get that medicine yeah

360
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:50,640
I'm just gonna tell you also save up three wasp nests so you can make a flooring later on the

361
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:55,840
other advantage of going to the islands is that almost everyone that I've been to had a message

362
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:02,560
in a bottle with the new DIY okay yeah the one the one I went to had a new person that wanted to

363
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:07,880
move to my island and I was like okay which by the way I love my default villagers they're so

364
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:14,280
great I got like the perfect I got one oh did you know school I got Agnes and I got Dom Agnes

365
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,480
is the black pig and Dom is this like Ram that wears a rainbow shirt and talks about his muscles

366
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:26,480
all the time nice and I got on one of the islands I'm getting chevra who I like one of my favorite

367
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:35,080
are the goats and the guy can't remember his name he's the takoyaki head guy that looks like takoyaki

368
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:42,040
oh yeah and see Brad got BAM and cherry who are like two of my favorites but I need to get Dina

369
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:48,240
I'm gonna order Dina when I can all right Dean is my resident lesbian anyway any other thoughts

370
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:55,640
on that Animal Crossing for for now it really takes the formula and expands upon it and it

371
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:01,920
really it it'd be like I've got to do what to get what but the busywork makes the time fly and gives

372
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:09,160
you so much more to do it and Ed will die Brad I will hit him with my axe in his head until he dies

373
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:16,680
by the way speaking of the axe I highly suggest if you make the full axe still keep a stone axe

374
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:21,480
on hand because you can whack a tree three times with the stone axe and it won't fall over you

375
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,160
whack it three times with a regular axe and that you'll lose the tree oh I didn't know that that's

376
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,200
good to know I thought it'll give you two pieces of wood and then the tree will die so so state

377
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,140
save yourself a stone axe I thought the only way to pull out the trees was to do the whole eat the

378
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,800
fruit and use the shovel because one of the villagers taught me that trick or something you

379
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:45,760
can pull it up but if you want to destroy it you cut it down and then dig up the root mmm

380
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:52,120
interesting just like you know before and I'll tell you if you've eaten fruit and you just want

381
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:58,160
to hit a rock without destroying it keep keep a wood shovel you can no but you can also if you

382
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:03,400
eat the fruit and use the shovel on a tree you dig up the entire tree right but I'm talking about

383
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:10,080
the rocks if you're stuff out of it yeah and you've eaten fruit do not use your regular shovel

384
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:17,120
do not use it use use a wood shovel and Bobby says you can replant that tree that's what I

385
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:22,120
used to do in my old villages is I would take you can replant your rocks I would take all the the

386
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:26,160
regular trees and replace them with fruit trees but I'm not sure if that's the smartest idea now

387
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,680
because you actually need like wood and things like that for that come from the regular trees

388
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:35,360
so I don't know if that's the fruit trees will give you wood too oh that's good okay but still

389
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:42,520
there are so many trees in game and I actually super like them so the only one now if you hit

390
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:48,160
bamboo if you find an island with bamboo dig up your sprouts you know the little look like little

391
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:54,640
dig spots around them and whack them with the with the stone axe and you'll get two different

392
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:00,320
kinds of bamboo I don't have any crafting for them yet but you'll get different things just

393
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,840
stockpile and when you get your house you'll get storage and just stockpile everything don't throw

394
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:13,120
away your cans don't throw away your tires don't throw away your boots yeah you know pansy buds

395
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,960
right now talking about all this crafting and everything I think one thing that's important

396
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,200
to point out about this Animal Crossing that I think kind of makes it you know a good one is

397
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,360
that it's for all the criticism the Animal Crossing series gets of kind of being the same

398
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:32,040
game over and over again I think this one really took the biggest step incrementally above the last

399
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,560
game and I think it learned a lot from the popularity of things like Minecraft and Stardew

400
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,440
Valley when it comes to things like crafting when it comes to being able to have the freedom to build

401
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,480
things outside as well as inside I think it's kind of learned a lot from that and the game is showing

402
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:52,040
a lot of strength because of that I think yeah no I really like that I've you know I liked putting

403
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:59,080
you know bonfires outside I have my my big bonfire on one of the rocks and every time it gets

404
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:06,440
Twilight I light it and then I hear from Dan Gondor calls for aid all right anything else to

405
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:13,560
share about your gaming week Dark Saga okay Loki how about you how was your gaming week I've been

406
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:22,800
mainly playing order that's pretty much it so I'm up to 162 I think and yeah it's just been doing

407
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,640
lots of raids and all that fun stuff I think I played a little bit DDR earlier this week and

408
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:35,400
that's pretty much a dig animal crossing have not played it yet my kids have played it and then my

409
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:43,440
wife and my youngest son went back to play the 3ds Animal Crossing and then uh what else I've been

410
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:49,500
looking to put step mania on my arcade cabinet since our DDR machine since I've got time to do

411
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:55,120
that now and so I just was originally I wanted to create my own custom theme which I still probably

412
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:59,720
will at some point but I just want to get something working now so I picked out a theme that looks okay

413
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,400
and then I'm just gonna dump songs in it what but I've been fighting my computer the entire

414
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,000
week because it just hasn't been working and keeps crashing so I had to reload windows which

415
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,560
is a joy and I can't find all my step mania songs I downloaded all this stuff there's like tons of

416
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:22,840
songs somewhere on my 5 terabyte drive and I can't find them so I have to dig those up or just redownload

417
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:29,400
them because hey thank you Comcast taking away bandwidth caps right now so download away that's

418
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,600
pretty much it late breaking news of sorts I'm looking in our chat room over twitch TV slash

419
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:39,040
vog network and Bobby Blackwell says off topic but we just talked about this in a previous segment

420
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,560
Canada about 15 minutes ago just announced they're not gonna participate in the Olympics if they are

421
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:48,600
held so Canada's put their foot down and said move the damn Olympics basically and that's that

422
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,520
that's probably gonna do the trick is I'm sure Canada will not be the only country to put their

423
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:58,640
foot down and say move the damn Olympics you know because it's not just about the Olympics being in

424
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:04,320
this summer but it's about all the qualifiers and things that have to lead up to the Olympics

425
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:10,080
and so I think that's what the problem really ends up being is that you know we may be in a place you

426
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:14,840
know come July or whenever the August I forget when the Olympics are where it might be okay to

427
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:20,080
you know we don't have to worry as much about social distancing by then maybe but it's more

428
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:24,560
like how are they gonna run the qualifiers because that stuff happens months before you picking who

429
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,360
goes to the Olympics so very very interesting very interesting update and of course there's

430
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:35,920
always video game tie-ins for the Olympics so if the Olympics get pushed to 2021 you'll still have

431
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,480
Mario and Sonic at the Olympics 2020 out there somewhere it's very interesting are they gonna

432
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:46,920
play Mario and Sonic at the Olympics on the Ocho like they're doing today possibly possibly anyway

433
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:54,000
I also see DJ Orwell is in chat reminding us half-life Alex is out very soon in 15 hours so

434
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,160
I think there's gonna be a lot of people at least VR enabled people that are really looking forward

435
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:04,840
to that this week I know that's a big big game for all the talk about Doom Eternal and Animal

436
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:08,120
Crossing kind of being the big launches this weekend you know it's still within the same

437
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:13,120
seven-day period as half a new half-life game which is a really big deal as well so I'm really

438
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:17,760
looking forward to seeing what the reaction is to that and how people are enjoying that I don't

439
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,080
really have the VR set up to be able to enjoy it myself but I can't wait to live vicariously

440
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:27,880
through others and see if it's maybe something I need to get into for my sometimes half-life

441
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:32,720
obsessed husband we'll see I'll probably have to pick it up just to put it in my backlog to never

442
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:38,080
play like the rest of my scene games now Johnny Wolf a in chat is talking about his gaming week

443
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:45,800
consisting of doom 64 and doom eternal and I gotta say unfortunately I I picked up Animal Crossing I

444
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,640
did not pick up doom eternal just because I didn't really want to drop the big money on that right

445
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,760
now although I didn't even think to maybe go back and get doom 64 so maybe I will but I don't know

446
00:42:53,760 --> 00:43:01,600
um but I was watching our pal Charles over at giant-sized team up was doing a stream the other

447
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:07,440
day of doom eternal and so I was just kind of watching him play it and it does look like fun

448
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:14,920
I got it I gotta say and I really enjoyed the doom reboot that they did in 2016 I think so like I

449
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:21,120
want to get doom at some point but I I just didn't feel the need to get it right away like I feel

450
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:27,880
like I can maybe wait till like a Black Friday sale type of situation but we'll see so but the

451
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:32,480
other thing I'll say about first-person shooters so as we get into my gaming week so a game that I

452
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,600
actually played this week and I swear I didn't do this just to get dark soccer to make a noise I

453
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:46,280
played Halo this week legit here's why you better be glad I'm muted here's why here's what yeah I

454
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:51,400
can't hear your eyes rolling when you're muted no but the reality is is that um speaking of doom

455
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:59,320
2016 I was on Xbox game pass because like Loki I'm thinking about oh we have all this bandwidth now

456
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:04,040
and especially you know I'm not gonna suck down all the bandwidth during the hours that people are

457
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:09,960
trying to work but on a Saturday night or something I might oh let my Xbox one run those

458
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:16,400
90 gigabytes of updates it's been needing to do for about a year now which I did let it do and I

459
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,240
started to kind of look around like what else can I download and doom 2016 was on Xbox game pass I

460
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:25,640
noticed and then I saw a halo the Master Chief collection that reminded me oh I have that on PC

461
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:33,160
and I think they added halo one into that on PC and sure enough they did so I played halo within

462
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:40,440
the Master Chief collection on PC thanks to game pass and yeah it looks it looks really nice and I

463
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,200
love playing those games with mouse and keyboard as opposed to controller I mean I like controller

464
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:48,800
but mouse and keyboard feels really good as well and I really like one thing I do really like about

465
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:55,480
halo in that collection is that all you have to do is hit the tab key and it switches between

466
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:02,000
old-school graphics and new-school graphics like without any loading time so it's really kind of

467
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,040
interesting to be like no filter filter no and the the difference is pretty stunning actually so

468
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,040
that was like a weird kind of thing I was kind of playing with and I thought was interesting taking

469
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:17,440
advantage of you know the Xbox game pass since I have that other games I've checked out this week

470
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,720
Animal Crossing of course I don't need to double repeat a lot of what dark soccer has said and

471
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,080
because I kind of inserted my own opinion while she was talking about that but I am enjoying it

472
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:33,000
I think it is a big step up compared to the previous games and I I think it's a great thing

473
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:40,680
to have come out right now like unintentionally so like with this irritated as everyone got remember

474
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:45,000
when you were all mad that Animal Crossing got delayed now it's one of those things where it's

475
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,280
like secretly I'm with the state of everything that's going on in the world I'm kind of glad it

476
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:57,000
happened now like we needed that game this weekend so that's really great other games

477
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,920
that I've been checking out this week I I randomly got back into Diablo 3 I think I talked a little

478
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,960
bit about that last week and I've been playing my seasonal character still continuing on in Final

479
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:10,880
Fantasy 14 because of course the game I haven't really touched this weekend which surprises me

480
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:19,640
PSO 2 is in open beta right now and I just haven't jumped on to play it yet I think because with the

481
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:24,560
closed beta it was like you have this weekend to play it and you got to get all this stuff done or

482
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,680
you're not gonna get your Dreamcast mag I was like oh I got a Russian and do it but now with the open

483
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:34,240
beta it's like it's running for like two weeks so I'm like oh I I don't really feel the need to rush

484
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,600
in there and do the open beta I'll get around to it when I get around to it so that's kind of been

485
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:45,400
my attitude with that on Xbox plus I just updated everything on my Xbox including the PSO client the

486
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:52,520
other night so that is that is something Bobby Black Wolf says I forgot to talk about PSO 2 on

487
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:57,200
my show they haven't given me my Dreamcast mag yet I don't think we were supposed to get that

488
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,120
until the game officially launches so I don't think that's supposed to show up until the actual

489
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:06,080
launch of the game which I still don't think they've dated actually but we'll probably know

490
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:11,480
a little more on that soon so anyway that was my gaming week let's move on and get into some of the

491
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:17,560
news what's going on in the gaming world this week so Loki you want to start us off sure so

492
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:27,280
thankfully this week we had Mark Cerny coming to us from the spaceship of love to reveal the

493
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:37,400
PlayStation 5 tech specs so I have some information on those so of course a very similar wise or spec

494
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:44,960
wise to I would say the Xbox Series X of course there were a little bit of differences and they

495
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:52,360
kind of went into some really big details regarding that some of the cool stuff that they were talking

496
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:59,400
about where the fact that with that new SSD that there's going to be very little load time talking

497
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:04,920
about how they're gonna be like deduping the data on there because originally because of the load

498
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:09,800
speeds and where you had your data on the disk it might take longer to access some of that so there

499
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:16,240
was a little bit of duplication to be able to access certain assets on there but kind of overall

500
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:23,640
you know it's gonna be an eight cores into custom CPU they're gonna have the rDNA 2 GPU as well

501
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:30,120
which is kind of similar the PlayStation 5 supposed to run at 3.5 gigahertz and then the GPU pushes a

502
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:35,960
few more teraflops of course he basically said that hey listen you know the teraflops are gonna

503
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:40,680
be a little bit different than what you might see with like an a PC or an Xbox Series X or whatever

504
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:49,440
just based on the custom architecture you know 16 gigabytes is GDDR6 and the internal storage

505
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:55,960
which is kind of weird it's kind of not really a round number but 825 gigabytes SSD it's m.2

506
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:06,720
NVMe but that is expandable with your own SSDs as well but they're gonna be benchmarking certain

507
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:11,440
ones that are gonna be compatible because of the speed of the system they need to make sure that

508
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:17,880
those SSDs are gonna be fast enough to be able to do what they needed to do for the PlayStation 5

509
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:23,360
so it was interesting very technical talk obviously something that was supposed to be done during GDC

510
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:32,240
the filming of it with the silhouette so it was a little ms3 3k but I don't know that was odd

511
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:37,960
was interesting yeah yes I kept wondering like I'm like is that like is that real or is that like

512
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:43,240
just like an animated thing it would have been funnier if they were like Sony characters like

513
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:48,640
Oh Nathan Drake is there and Kratos and why is randomly Parappa the Rappa and like all these

514
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:54,080
really odd silhouettes that would have been funny but it was supposed to be a serious talk so you

515
00:49:54,080 --> 00:50:00,440
know because clearly it was their GDC talk very clearly it was very interesting to see how again

516
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:05,280
the media kind of hype things up and I'm talking you know as much as I praise and I talk about the

517
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:11,320
independent media this one's kind of on the indie media I think really read way too much into Sony's

518
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:16,720
original tweet and blog announcement because I saw these posts going around about big PlayStation

519
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:22,800
5 reveal tomorrow and you know who's most guilty of this and I'm calling you out is the youtubers

520
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:28,960
some youtubers not all youtubers but some youtubers were like all big PS 5 reveal event

521
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:34,760
predictions big games being announced tomorrow my game predictions for the PS 5 event y'all

522
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:42,200
fucked up you need to not like put your expectations on the reality of what Sony is saying

523
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:48,200
because that stuff just makes for videos I mean come on it's just it's clickbait set but yeah I

524
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:53,240
get it we all need to be like like and we need like I'm not saying we need to bully people or

525
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:59,200
but we need to say hey you made a mistake and set the expectations way too high you need to be

526
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,200
careful about that next time and that's all you know I'm not saying shut them down or anything

527
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,560
like that I'm not saying that I'm just saying like you got a little egg on your face if you

528
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:14,440
you you know if you were expecting games games games Sony never said games and y'all have to

529
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:18,900
really like and you can't and again it goes back to what we're talking about earlier in the the

530
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:24,440
show like the whole double sourcing thing if one source is telling you that fine but if if the

531
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:29,960
source says according to a PlayStation tweet that it uh which how many of those sites that post

532
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:36,200
things on Facebook how many of them are according to a tweet or according to an Instagram post

533
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,480
that's like so much of what we see right now right so go back and read the tweet for yourself

534
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:47,840
and see what they're really saying because that is all the article says is the 280 characters

535
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:54,680
that's in that tweet and again Sony never said anything about games and so that's why I was not

536
00:51:54,680 --> 00:52:01,000
surprised whatsoever yeah I tuned into the talk and in the first 90 seconds Mark Cerny said we

537
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:08,320
have all year to show you games so we'll show you games later and so at that exactly and it was

538
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:12,520
interesting I was disappointed though because he talked about like oh yeah we're gonna have a tear

539
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:18,360
down I was like ooh tear down and then they've never did it so that was kind of point one of the

540
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:21,800
other things they kind of mentioned though because he was talking about backwards compatibility so

541
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,160
that is definitely gonna be a focus this time around they were even talking about like game

542
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:31,520
development wise they have the architecture for like the PlayStation 4 stuff available so that

543
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:36,480
you're gonna have a lot of games that could even be built around that kind of architecture still

544
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:43,200
on the PlayStation 5 they did promise he said that they're looking at the top most the one our most

545
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:48,040
popular PlayStation 4 games they weren't aiming to make sure that those are backwards compatible but

546
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:52,760
he says you know that we believe that the overwhelming majority of the 4,000 plus games

547
00:52:52,760 --> 00:53:00,080
on PlayStation 4 will be playable on PlayStation 5 so that's pretty cool that is awesome yeah a lot

548
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:05,040
of people kind of reacted to that the thing in his talk about the 100 games but it's good to see

549
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,960
that and that was a good thing for Sony to kind of step in and clarify because yeah the way it was

550
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,520
worded in there I think a lot of people read into that that oh my gosh there's gonna be barely any

551
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:18,840
game it's gonna be like the rollout of Xbox games on Xbox 360 you remember that where it was like a

552
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,680
chunk of them every few months but it sounds like Sony is way ahead of that like when they put out

553
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:29,480
their clarifying statement right yeah so it should be pretty good I think Xbox is gonna be in the

554
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:35,320
same boat because they kind of I don't know I think it's gonna be very similar hardware going

555
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:40,320
into it it will be interesting to see like all this stuff that they kind of talked about during

556
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:45,840
this presentation how that's gonna make a difference and I mean it could make a difference at the end

557
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:51,680
of the day it's gonna be the games so be just how these different developers utilize the hardware

558
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,880
that they have this is definitely laying the foundation for that because now when they have

559
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:00,080
their next thing they can talk a little more about games I mean it doesn't necessarily have to be

560
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:05,600
their next thing but on down the road they can really focus on having an announcement that's

561
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:13,400
just about the games you know one thing we should talk about with that GDC talk essentially that was

562
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:18,160
repurposed for YouTube that Sony did we need to talk about Mark Cerny himself for a little bit

563
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,480
because I know there were a lot of people on Twitter that were poking fun at him a little

564
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,760
bit because he has a lot of mannerisms very similar to Dana Carvey he's very soft-spoken

565
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:32,040
and so forth and so some people were kind of poking fun at that and so forth but um y'all

566
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:37,920
better not forget and I forgot this until someone pointed it out on our discord that badass mother

567
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:48,120
fucker Mark Cerny made marble madness when he was like 17 or 18 so don't you forget it so when

568
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:53,000
you're teasing him saying he's like you know Dana Carvey's impressions or something don't forget he

569
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,360
made marble madness which is one of the like that was that was one of the all-time most creative

570
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:06,440
original arcade games it was a badass NES game as well so well where's my ray traced marble game

571
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:12,440
for PlayStation 5 hey you never know you never know he's he's also contributed to other games

572
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:16,680
and so forth but that was just like when somebody pointed that out and you kind of go look at the

573
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:21,600
dude's resume it's like dang this guy made some big contributions to gaming and ended up kind of

574
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:26,760
going to work for Sony on the hardware side like this guy like knows what he's doing because he's

575
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:32,880
been in there programming games and so forth for a very long time and do it doing some of the

576
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:39,880
all-time great games for sure Tiger Claw and chat says if they make a movie about Mark Cerny Dana

577
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:46,320
Carvey should totally play him okay that I will allow that I will allow but let us let us not

578
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:51,800
underestimate how powerful Mark Cerny is as some of his contributions to gaming all right anyway

579
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:56,560
let's move on and talk a little bit about what happened in Nintendo's world this week Nintendo

580
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:01,680
had an indie event so they did one of their indie directs or the indie world showcase if you will

581
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,680
where they showed off some of the indie games that are coming to switch over the next couple

582
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:12,600
months or things that were coming out today like exit the Gungeon now I think we knew this game was

583
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:16,320
coming I want to say we had heard about this before but we didn't know it was gonna be the

584
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:22,880
surprise drop on us as of today so exit there as of the day of the the event so exit the Gungeon

585
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:28,840
another bullet-hell dungeon climber but it is following the events of enter the Gungeon so

586
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:33,320
that's pretty cool Loki I don't know if you've had a chance to check out exit the Gungeon yet

587
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:38,840
but I know you were a big fan of enter the Gungeon right I have not checked it out I think it was out

588
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:45,960
on Apple Arcade already and then they're just porting it over to switch I don't know if it's

589
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:53,760
out on PC that's right I think you're right about Apple Arcade yeah now another you know I gotta say

590
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,640
there weren't a lot of like indie titles that we knew a lot about there weren't a lot of like big

591
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:02,560
names that were really jumping out but I mean they're Indies so sometimes you don't know that

592
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:08,400
an indie game is gonna really take over like you know Minecraft, Crypt of the Necrodancer,

593
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:14,600
Five Nights at Freddy's they were all indie games too but I thought this was very interesting is

594
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:20,480
that one of the game creators that showed up during this event was Hello Games and their

595
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:26,520
contribution is a game called The Last Campfire Hello Games if you will recall is the studio

596
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:33,760
behind No Man's Sky so it is kind of interesting after everything that that game No Man's Sky went

597
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:38,880
through being a hugely hyped launch on the PlayStation 4 when essentially it was kind of

598
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:46,240
an indie title they got a lot of AAA promotion treatment and so forth and then we saw how that

599
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:50,400
went for them when the game first came out but again and I said this before if you haven't

600
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:55,640
touched No Man's Sky since it first came out it's a completely different game now very similar to

601
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:01,440
what Diablo 3 went through Final Fantasy 14 or Destiny 2 you know one of those games has been

602
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:08,360
really transformed No Man's Sky is right up there so I think a lot of people were kind of wondering

603
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:13,640
ooh what big sci-fi thing might Hello Games do next but it is interesting to note that now this

604
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:20,760
indie studio Hello Games is doing an indie game but I'm looking forward to it because I love No

605
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:27,720
Man's Sky so I'm curious to see what they do their game is called The Last Campfire and it's

606
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:32,520
about a wilderness where there are strange creatures mysterious ruins and you are trying

607
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:38,080
to light the last campfire it's a tale of magic and mystery and it's coming out for the Nintendo

608
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:41,960
Switch this summer so some that was kind of the biggest surprise for me out of this was like oh

609
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:47,080
Hello Games ready to show what they're working on next and it's a little bit more of a scaled back

610
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:51,000
if you will indie title so I'm really excited to check that out on some other things that were

611
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:58,040
announced at the Nintendo indie event Blue Fire from Robie Studios Baldo from Naps Team I Am Dead

612
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:04,400
from Hollow Ponds which I was kind of like ooh I don't know if this is the most well-timed game

613
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:09,040
announcement with all that's going on in the world but it does look like an interesting puzzle

614
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:15,880
adventure game and so forth so that's that a game called Bee Ark or Bark where pugs cats bears and

615
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:22,320
bunnies save the solar system sign me the fuck up that sounds awesome and I love the name Bee Ark

616
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:29,960
bark cyanide and happiness Freakpocalypse part one so I'm assuming that's based on the comic

617
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:35,640
so I love that series so I have to play it yeah so I'm sure yeah some folks will be really excited

618
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:42,400
about that Summer in Mara from Chibig Quantum League from Nimble Giant Entertainment The Good

619
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:50,560
Life from White Owls Inc pixel junk eat pixel junk Eden 2 from Q games Feria from abracam hope

620
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:56,760
I said that right eldest souls from fallen flag studio moving out from SMG studio and sky racket

621
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:05,380
from double dash studios all of that coming out in the next either some of them came out that sky

622
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:08,960
racket actually just came out this week some of those other titles coming up throughout the

623
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:13,800
summer and so forth there's some other titles in there as well apparently Blair Witch from

624
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:18,560
bluebird another Blair Witch game from bluebird team coming out as well and so on many many more

625
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:26,120
and they also announced a new indie focus Twitter account that's pretty cool at indie world and a

626
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:33,000
IND IE world and a so pretty cool hopefully some of you guys looking to check out some of those

627
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:38,120
games quest buster and chat says exit the gungeon just came out but I don't think it's as well

628
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:44,200
received you know it's it it's a orange right says Oh exit the gungeon did seem familiar like

629
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:50,160
it was already announced I guess that's it yeah um it's you know and especially right now in the

630
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:54,480
world a lot of these games are kind of struggling to get noticed amongst everything else going on

631
01:00:54,480 --> 01:01:01,240
but I think as this new normal and I'm using my quote II fingers because it's hard to think of

632
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:06,120
this as normal but for the next eight to ten weeks or whatever it might be as this new normal kind of

633
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:11,880
settles in I think we'll kind of get used to these sorts of announcements and things so anyway

634
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:17,560
a different way of doing things moving on Dark Sakura of course you're gonna have an Animal

635
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:26,680
Crossing story right yeah I was actually a little surprised but uh there is a and I might have

636
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:35,800
talked about her before it was this 87 year old lady who had a 3500 plus hour Animal Crossing

637
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:43,960
town her grandson Paul posted this pic this video of her her name is Audrey she's showing off her

638
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:50,800
progress on the 3ds game on you leave she'd been playing every day for four years and of course

639
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:58,440
everyone loves her because she is everyone's Animal Crossing grandmother so it looks like

640
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:08,080
that they based a character in New Horizons off of her Audrey's nickname is Adi and so there's a

641
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:15,720
character in the game now called Adi who wears a cute little blue dress and shades and she's a

642
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:24,040
one of the foxy ones and looks like that's a tribute to this gaming grandmother I love

643
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:30,200
that props to Nintendo for doing that and maybe the little win games do that me too and you know

644
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:35,280
you got to respect your gaming grandmas keep in mind we're all self isolating right now so that

645
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:40,760
our gaming grandmas don't get sick you know it's a big it's a big part of it so has precious it must

646
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:45,920
be protected that's right she's precious do it hashtag do it for Audrey hashtag do it for Betty

647
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:52,880
White honestly we got any whites immortal we got to save the elderly you guys well did you see the

648
01:02:52,880 --> 01:03:04,360
PSA that went out by Max Brooks Mel Brooks's son who oh yeah I did see that he's like if he gets

649
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:13,560
sick then Dick Van Dyke and all these others and I was like yeah let's let's be nice and Bobby is

650
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:18,520
pointing out this whole thing is the localization team which I know sometimes localization team that

651
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:23,760
sneaks these types of things in here the Japanese name was something not directly translatable so

652
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:28,840
the US team named her Adi so that's a lot of the Japanese names are nothing that's directly

653
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:36,360
translatable yeah but I do like when there are nods to them like I hadn't seen captain but he

654
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:46,320
was clearly a kappa and Tom Nook would be for a tanuki yeah and just to make sure I didn't

655
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:51,280
misrepresent anything I want to make sure I'm very clear kovat does not only attack the elder

656
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:55,760
elderly they are the most vulnerable but we are self isolating to keep each other healthy as well

657
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:02,080
because this can affect folks in their 40s like me 30s 50s you know we're doing it for each other

658
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:09,200
yeah I can absolutely big batch of people younger and that's why even if you know if it's just

659
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:16,440
pneumonia for me I still can't leave the house oh yeah because secondary infections are really

660
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:21,640
really bad news with that stuff absolutely it was kind of the other way around to remember when you

661
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:25,840
and I had swine flu all those years ago it seems like it was such a memory fucking no I had swine

662
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:30,240
flu yeah we didn't know till after that and and not to compare the two because these are very very

663
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:35,840
different things but the thing was swine flu and when even after I was diagnosed I felt fine I

664
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:43,280
still had to stay home for a week my doctor put me in quarantine for a week because I couldn't catch

665
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:48,240
anything secondary in the whole time and it was the whole time I thought oh she's isolating me she

666
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:51,800
doesn't want me to give it to my class because I was a corporate trainer at the time and I had a

667
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:57,680
class of 30 people no she didn't want the class getting me sick again because that was the

668
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:03,080
dangerous part and I think some of that is in play with kovat but again I don't I'm not a doctor

669
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:09,720
I don't misrepresent anything you don't want it it's not just the flu don't get it if you can

670
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:16,320
if you'll remember after I had swine flu I developed a nasty sinus infection and bronchitis

671
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:25,680
yeah remember I do so if I had known that I had that I would have stayed inside and not gone to

672
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:33,520
eat delicious matzo ball soup that made me feel better all right yeah back to all this we need to

673
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:41,440
protect our gaming grandmothers and the ones that we love and and honestly for everyone who's saying

674
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:48,440
boomer remover I wish you would seriously shut the fuck up these are our parents yeah that's all

675
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:54,960
and it's if you think this thing only targets based on age you need to like read a newspaper

676
01:05:54,960 --> 01:06:01,440
or like just literally listen to anything going on right now because we just had an a report of

677
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:07,080
somebody in their 30s in the Hollywood area who went to Disney World you know not again that's

678
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:10,280
the that's the dangerous thing about this like you might go oh my god why did he go to Disney

679
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:15,360
World because he wasn't he didn't he didn't feel sick he didn't look sick he would but he had it

680
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:19,440
and because this thing has an incubation period of 14 days he didn't know and he ended up passing

681
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:25,400
away from it it's really tragic so and I'll just tell people even it this is my last time even if

682
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:31,440
you're not under shelter in place even if you're just only in social distancing please act like

683
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:38,920
you are under shelter in place please you will you'll be doing your part you'll be preventing

684
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:43,680
the spread I'm really surprised that bigger metropolitan areas there are still places in

685
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:51,120
this country that haven't enacted it don't go out like to buy planters or a video game in public or

686
01:06:51,120 --> 01:07:01,280
you know don't don't go to a bar or any of that the more you expose yourself the more other people

687
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:06,720
and Bobby Bobby black wolf is saying in chat too late because he openly admitted he went out and

688
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:12,000
got a video game this week but admittedly this is also a situation that's changing day by day like

689
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,840
the day you win it like even the night you went out to get the game things did not feel as dire

690
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:21,600
as they are day by day I was we're hearing more and more about like what this thing is really

691
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:28,000
doing so like you know we all probably thought we could take it a little bit lighter than it

692
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:34,080
really is at some point early on I'm sure we've all been guilty of that a little bit but yeah heck

693
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:39,280
I still went on my cruise you know what and I don't know luckily nobody on the shit you know

694
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:44,440
it's today is 14 days since the cruise and there's been no reports of COVID from the cruise so it was

695
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:48,920
everything was fine and dandy and so forth but I certainly make no apologies for that but you

696
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:55,520
know if that cruise had been just a week and a half later I don't think I would have gone so

697
01:07:55,520 --> 01:08:00,480
you know timing is really everything really really everything but honestly those airports were way

698
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:05,960
more filthy than the boat was just saying yeah who has that you know who has bad timing hmm my

699
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:10,720
husband for vacuuming while I can hear it through the door well we don't we don't hear it through

700
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:17,480
the on the station for what it's worth so all right anyhow let us move on Loki I think you're

701
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:25,160
next yes that's true so we kind of knew this was gonna happen considering that a Sony made

702
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:30,080
the announcement last week or a medium alcohol I can't remember who was it you'd be able to soon

703
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:38,440
sell some of your creations that you make in dreams well you know all the videos I've seen

704
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:43,680
of dreams online have all benches recreations of other games or like all sorts of copyright

705
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:49,520
infringement stuff so of course there's a lot of Mario games out there and one of the creators

706
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:58,880
goes by the name of piece of craft he had made a Mario game in dreams as well and he's received

707
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:05,960
a copyright strike on the model which basically disallows that game that he made to be played by

708
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:10,440
others in dreams and so the similar type of stuff is happening with some of these other

709
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:16,880
creations that utilize the models similar to that so definitely Nintendo is taking notice of these

710
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:22,480
Mario games that people are making in dreams so you're probably not going to be able to utilize

711
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:27,800
a lot of those copyright materials I would assume that more this would happen with some of the other

712
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:33,320
creations out there because I've seen all sorts of mix-ups with like spongebob and Shrek and all

713
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:37,600
the memes I mean it's really everything it's interesting you kind of talk about that because

714
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:41,200
and even Bobby's alluding to this in our chat right now over at twitch TV slash vog network

715
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:45,680
we're Bobby saying that's because the youtubers only focus on these creations there's a lot more

716
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:51,280
than that in a game and that's very true is that you know again it it gets more eyes and clicks

717
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:56,040
and things when it's like lol it's a spongebob meme inside dreams you know that type of thing

718
01:09:56,040 --> 01:10:01,280
gets more clicks than hey here's this person's totally original presentation and how cool it is

719
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:06,160
heck I'm guilty of this as well when the very first little big planet game came out the very

720
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:11,720
first one what did I say was my favorite level the shrine to Parker Posey level is still to this

721
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:16,560
day my favorite thing I've ever seen in little big planet but it was kind of okay like it's

722
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:21,760
like ripping off all these publicity photos of her and things like that I'd like to think at

723
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:26,360
the time it was still kind of a new and novel thing but yeah I mean we got to realize that

724
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:35,160
dreams has a lot more in it than just the copyright stuff but that's the stuff that gets people's

725
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:41,640
attention when it's like oh somebody recreated doom inside dreams what like that gets people's

726
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:46,200
attention whereas you know yeah yeah I mean it's just amazing what you can do with the gaming yeah

727
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:52,200
I know there's a lot of other stuff out there but and hopefully you know that this will they'll go

728
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:58,120
through this and it was just be removed although I mean that's not to say that it made stuff will

729
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:04,000
slip through I mean already the one of the other games that the guy made which was mario 64 HD in

730
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:10,920
dreams is still available to play without the model I guess and I know other games like roblox

731
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:15,640
and stuff like that I mean that's been around forever and there's all sorts of copyright

732
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:20,840
infringement stuff in there like I see my kids playing that and I'm just like how is that allowed

733
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:27,760
it's just it's people catching it so I'm sure this will be the end of it but at least people

734
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:32,560
can know that they are looking for it now and you know we've kind of talked about this phenomenon on

735
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:37,400
the show over the years many times you know whenever you have a game creation software

736
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:41,480
type of thing how long is and this we talked about this a little big planet first came out

737
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:46,480
we talked about this when Mario maker came out how long is it until someone recreates world one

738
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:52,640
one from Super Mario Brothers how long because I mean world one one is iconic because it's

739
01:11:52,640 --> 01:12:00,160
something that you recognize just based on that little formula of you know the little the line

740
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:04,040
here and I'm using my I'm making motions for those that are on the podcast and where those

741
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:09,600
question mark blocks are located so I mean that that's level design games so strong in world one

742
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:15,120
one that like you recognize that even when it's being copied in other games just interesting so

743
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:23,560
one of those types of phenomenons so anyway alright um let's move on and talk about a game

744
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:28,840
that valve put out a little while ago called artifact and I think valve actually didn't valve

745
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:33,840
pull this game at some point or they they way scale back on artifact but apparently it may be

746
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:39,440
coming back because dota twos it was a dota 2 based game called artifact it's kind of it's

747
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:43,720
basically their version of hearthstone I mean I know I'm not supposed to say that but you know

748
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:47,880
let's be real hearthstone caught a lot of eyes a lot of people wanted a piece of the pot with

749
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:53,720
that valves one of them so artifact was kind of their response to that but they aren't updating

750
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:58,720
it anymore now okay so the game isn't dead it was the updates that they stopped doing sorry I will

751
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:04,880
I haven't been following the game myself personally but that's what's going on however edge magazine

752
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:10,920
has some inside sources that are saying valve is working on a follow-up internally it's being

753
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:15,360
called artifact tube that doesn't necessarily mean that's what it is could be an expansion could be

754
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:20,160
a new game could be something you know it could be anything Gabe Newell once referred to artifact

755
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:25,640
as an interesting failure they thought it was a strong product saying quote we ran an experiment

756
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:29,400
we got a negative result and now we need to see if we've learned anything from that so let's try

757
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:34,280
again and that's what the artifact team has been doing and what they're getting ready to release

758
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:39,080
based on the reaction to it what was wrong with the product how do we get there let's fix those

759
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:44,000
things and take another run at it of course no information on when that updates gonna come out

760
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:50,960
or the sequel or anything like that but they do say that more details will come out after half

761
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:57,520
life Alex launches which understandable valve is very focused on the half-life Alex thing right now

762
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:03,160
so we'll know a little more information about whatever this artifact thing is at a later date

763
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:08,360
and if half-life Alex is successful then that gets more eyes on steam and a great place for them to

764
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:13,320
announce some more information about artifact whatever the future is for that so fifth dream

765
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:19,760
today in our chat says Wow cards dota cards low cards League of Legends cars guys come on well

766
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:25,200
it's you know and it doesn't stop there Elder Scrolls had their own game The Witcher did Gwent

767
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:33,400
as a standalone game you know a game when a game is extraordinarily popular like Hearthstone or if

768
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:37,960
you want to like Magic the Gathering and all the Magic the Gathering games on the computer everybody

769
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:41,960
wants a piece of that somehow how can we make a trading card game where we're not copying it

770
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:47,600
we're kind of putting our own spin on it and doing so I think that's one thing that everybody

771
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:54,080
wants a piece of I will say for what it's worth I think when a Hearthstone strengths is that it's

772
01:14:54,080 --> 01:15:00,720
very simplistic it's not a particularly difficult game to teach and I think the fact that Hearthstone

773
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:09,360
runs cross-platform very easily between tablets and phones completely agnostic a platform doesn't

774
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:18,280
matter if you're Apple Android what have you it sinks sinks that with PC so well I think that's a

775
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:24,040
huge asset for it that I'm not sure all of the other games have been able to copy as well so

776
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:30,200
food for thought anyway fifth dream today follows up and says I'm friends with people very involved

777
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:34,200
in some of the car games online like they work for the companies and streamers and wow it all

778
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:39,400
goes right over my head hype mayhem says to be honest I'm good with car games at the moment I'm

779
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:43,320
happy just playing my Magic the Gathering games on Steam yeah it's something it's like me and MMOs

780
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:48,480
it's hard to play more than one quest buster says honestly surprised that artifact is getting a

781
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:53,800
second pass especially after what its twitch channel turned into but gotta give valve credit

782
01:15:53,800 --> 01:16:00,000
for trying well they believe in it and you know games it's not unheard of for games to get rebooted

783
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:05,920
successfully again Diablo 3 no man's sky we've gone down this road a million times this is what

784
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:12,760
happens with games now in this year 2020 so we'll see if valve has any luck with that meanwhile Dark

785
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:21,000
Sakura what else do we have we have me trying to unmute my mic that's one of them no it's taking

786
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:27,320
some getting used to this new setup oh I hate this the site started playing everything automatically

787
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:31,720
it's not streaming through is it no we can't hear it we're only we're only hearing you well

788
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:38,040
it's playing I can't hear it just we're just hearing you we don't hear okay well it's bothering

789
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:43,320
me so I'll go ahead and try to read this while this is playing in the background oh there we go

790
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:49,680
sorry I found it I can't do both sounds at the same time it messes up my brain no you're fine

791
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:54,360
I don't know if Safari is like Chrome but there's like that using Safari I'm on a PC right now oh

792
01:16:54,720 --> 01:17:01,000
because Chrome has a little speaker icon you can click it and it'll shut shut it up yeah this it

793
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:09,600
doesn't do it for everything at any well done I have four browser windows open so at any rate

794
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:18,800
it was announced for the World Video Game Hall of Fame that they have their finalists up and ready

795
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:26,840
to go I have already done my voting so the games that are on the list this year are Bejeweled,

796
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:36,600
Centipede, Frogger, Goldeneye 007, Guitar Hero, King's Quest, Minecraft, NBA Jam, Nokia Snake,

797
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:42,360
Super Smash Brothers Melee, Uncharted 2 Among Thieves, and where in the world is Carmen Sand

798
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:48,400
Diego you don't know what I voted for can you only vote for one in that list I think you can

799
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:54,200
go back and vote but I just voted for one which one did you vote for where in the world is Carmen

800
01:17:54,200 --> 01:18:04,240
Sand Diego that's a good one if I were to vote in that poll ooh that's a tricky one Bejeweled,

801
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:08,400
Centipede, Frogger, Goldeneye, Guitar Hero, King's Quest, Minecraft, NBA Jam, Nokia Snake,

802
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:12,480
Super Smash Brothers, Uncharted, and where in the world is Carmen Sand Diego I would be very

803
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:17,880
tempted to vote for Nokia Snake but I think I would give it to King's Quest I think I'd have

804
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:22,080
to give it to King's Quest that was that whole Sierra I mean cuz King's Quest to me is

805
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:28,040
representative of the 90s Sierra PC era which and I'm sure Bobby Black Wolf is nodding his head and

806
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:33,640
there's many of you out there that are gonna be nodding your head those games were like formative

807
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:37,880
games for me and the contributions that Roberta Williams and you know everybody that worked on

808
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:42,800
those games is Sierra and so even Leisure Suit Larry Teehee you know though all of that stuff

809
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:47,480
was so important to my childhood that like I have to give it to King's Quest for sure and

810
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:51,840
Carmen Sandiego had a bigger impact on mine I didn't really enjoy the King's Quest games the

811
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:59,360
only real big game on those lines that I played a significant amount of was Luma yeah and you know

812
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:04,920
I it's again it's not a it's not a diss on where in the world is Carmen Sandiego like that game was

813
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:11,720
certainly important too but just for me I put King's Quest ahead of it Loki what about you from

814
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:14,880
that list what would you what game would you vote for to go in the Hall of Fame on that list

815
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:29,040
that's the time I didn't like King's Quest one too much I guess I would say Minecraft or Carmen

816
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:38,360
Sandiego okay I can see my craft but at any rate the voting is going to be going on through the

817
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:45,840
online ballot on April 2nd and I will find the link to post in chat right now but if you go to

818
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:53,440
World Video Game Hall of Fame org that's where everything is listed see and they do have some

819
01:19:53,440 --> 01:20:02,480
write-in places as well oh that's good I'm with Bobby I'm more of a Space Quest guy fair enough

820
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:08,080
and a one question about Minecraft if that were to win who gets to accept the award Microsoft or

821
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:18,040
that other guy I would hope the developer well notch is it yeah but I I don't need to hear him

822
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:25,200
give a speech so yeah but it was his creation yeah but I I think I'm fully admitting some of that you

823
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:29,040
know what the Oscars are politics too I suppose in a way but some of that would weigh into my

824
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:34,920
decision on why I wouldn't want to see minecraft get it well they still have a development team I

825
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:43,080
mean that's the folks that should be getting it so also for me it's not that minecraft is minecraft

826
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:47,080
also a little new for me I know it seems really weird to say but I just feel like some of these

827
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:51,160
other games on the list have more of a legacy and we have yet to see what minecraft's legacy

828
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:56,160
is truly going to be we're still like I feel like minecraft is still still a game that is being

829
01:20:56,160 --> 01:21:02,400
developed where's that where's that super 4k pack but anyway minecraft is still a game that's on

830
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:09,480
it's never happening never King's Quest 1 is done Carmen San Diego is done sure there's new Carmen

831
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:13,120
San Diego games there might be a new King's Quest games on it but those games essentially are done

832
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:18,320
so that's another thing that really weighs in for me so I mean be mad if you want I'm just telling

833
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:26,600
it like it is so there you go all right anyway let's move on let's talk about the next story

834
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:34,200
which I think Loki is yours so this is kind of fun since everybody's doing those wonderful directs

835
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:41,600
now so humble bundle is gonna be joining the party with their brand new series called the humble brag

836
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:48,400
it's where they're gonna be talking about games and I guess showing some different I don't know

837
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:52,680
deals that they're gonna be doing some of the stuff they're gonna be talking about courses

838
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:58,200
including their own releases because remember they are publishing some games now like them's

839
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:07,320
fighting herds and Temtem the first one's gonna take place on March 24th it looks like at 11 p.m.

840
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:18,800
Pacific Time and March 25th at 2 p.m. Eastern Time so and those are kind of some weird weird times to

841
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:26,600
put those live but I guess we'll have to see more about what this is all about I mean I don't know

842
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:32,960
I don't really have high expectations but neat they might have they might have secured some more

843
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:36,880
like indie stuff because like you said they're doing publishing now which I totally forgot that

844
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:41,400
that was the thing but the them fighting herds that's that one's kind of a big deal that's the

845
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:48,120
one that's like it's my little pony but it's not wink right right and that just came out of early

846
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:55,160
access that's the skull girls folks made that game right or am I crazy I don't remember who

847
01:22:55,160 --> 01:23:01,560
made that okay I just know I just know there was a lot of like pony fandom mixed with like school

848
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:07,840
girls mixed with that so somebody in chat maybe can explain the difference to me but I just that

849
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:12,440
oh thank you DJ Rama S it used the school girls engine that's okay I knew there was a tie to

850
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:16,600
school girls in there somehow but it was an independent company okay thank you so I knew

851
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:20,760
there was a tie-in somewhere there they that's why I love doing this with a live chat room because

852
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:25,560
you guys can course correct me when I'm I'm like I remember some of the details but not all of them

853
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:30,800
because an awful lot happens in gaming so all right all right well we'll see what comes through

854
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:38,240
with the humble humble brags I love that name yeah so they're saying though okay so they had

855
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:45,920
a few different dates for the the humble brag presentations although the actual tweet those

856
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:51,640
mentions March 24th at 9 a.m. Pacific time which sends more reasonable I'm not sure why they said

857
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:57,280
there's bring a humble brag presentation will go live and then they have this like long day range

858
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:02,920
so I would say March 24th 9 a.m. Pacific time okay we'll see what they have to announce I guess

859
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:06,640
we'll have something to talk about on next week's show regarding all this all right well meanwhile

860
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:09,960
before we get to the classic game of the week talking about some things you can do right now

861
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:15,160
I mentioned earlier in the show I was using Xbox game pass to check out like Halo and stuff this

862
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:20,800
week and I'm sure some of you guys are using your suddenly open bandwidth connections to download a

863
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:25,120
lot of stuff that you're a little bit behind on well apparently now Xbox game pass ultimate will

864
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:30,080
include bonuses like content in the games themselves and I saw some of this as I was

865
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:36,280
browsing this week they're called perks and some of the initial extras involve cosmetics and

866
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:41,760
characters they're saying a gold ticket mission pass and fantasy star online too I didn't see that

867
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:45,480
though when I went in to look at the perks but maybe that's not gonna happen till the game

868
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:50,920
launches I don't know I did see the ship ornaments in Sea of Thieves and the gods and smite I saw

869
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:55,640
some of that you don't have to do anything extra to enable the perks you just get them through Xbox

870
01:24:55,640 --> 01:25:01,280
one or you get them through the beta app on Windows 10 or the mobile app so plenty of ways to get

871
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:07,360
those perks not surprising to hear about that at all that's very similar to what PlayStation Plus

872
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:12,560
has because they have some perks with games as well like I've seen like apex legends stuff and

873
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:18,600
things to tie into PlayStation Plus so it's not too surprising to see Microsoft get on on that

874
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:23,120
too except instead of putting it at the Xbox gold level they're putting it at the game pass level

875
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:28,240
but I think we're all sitting here going it's really just a matter of time before they fuse

876
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:35,480
Xbox gold and Xbox game pass together I think that's coming it's just a matter of when because

877
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:40,400
certainly if you want to buy both and I think the game pass ultimate is both those things

878
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:48,120
combined so a lot of people are getting in on that so anyway there you go let's take a trip

879
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:53,600
down memory lane before you could actually download all these special things you had to

880
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:58,600
have a cartridge if you wanted to play something taking a trip down memory lane every week Dark

881
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:02,760
Sakura steps in the vault and finds a game that she thinks hey you should be checking out this

882
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:07,080
game this week Dark Sakura what is the classic game of the week that you picked for us this week

883
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:15,320
I picked a stinker I picked a bad one I picked safe clued in sets pretty fighter and specifically

884
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:27,800
this one is on the Super Famicom it is a fighting game from 1984 published by imagineer and it is of

885
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:34,760
course a one or two player game it does not go for very much if you find one but it is novel

886
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:42,600
it even did get a sequel called pretty fighter X at some point but basically with this game you

887
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:50,920
are different characters who have different uniforms with a different color and they they

888
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:57,960
have some salacious like content but nothing like cornish you know it's like fanboy service you know

889
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:08,480
but the original game the one on Super Famicom had different characters eight of them that had

890
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:15,840
their family name contained something specific for the color that represented them so we had

891
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:26,280
Aoki Marin was a schoolgirl that wore Pina Blue and she's the main character of the series there's

892
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:36,960
a Shiratori Kris who is a nurse her color is white a Saksa Judy who is a friend of Marin's and she

893
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:47,280
moonlights his athletic dancer and her color is red for Akka there's Kono Keiko who fights an officer here her color is

894
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:54,240
navy blue Kiyori Yoko who is a college student who just wears you know traditional clothing her color

895
01:27:54,240 --> 01:28:01,120
is yellow you know kimono by traditional is what I meant Midori Kawa Minami who is a private school

896
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:10,000
girl and wears green Momoyama Ai is a gymnast wears like gymnastics outfit her color is pink

897
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:21,720
Zen Momo like peach and Yamaguki Yawara is a judo wrestler and she wears golden yellow so the game

898
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:31,200
believe it or not it's not like the worst I have played many many bad fighting games in my time it

899
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:39,480
actually is graphically pretty good it the characters are well designed I think the concepts are great

900
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:47,080
it's it's the thing about it being terrible it's really average and when something is average we

901
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:59,040
call it terrible as far as the other ones or you know I don't think that pretty fighter X was that

902
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:09,000
much better I actually have pretty fighter X I I had played it so long ago but yeah it's uh it's

903
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:13,760
pretty average I'm just gonna say that it's I think it's worth everyone playing at least once

904
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:23,640
and you've got some different interesting things like for example you have throws for your

905
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:30,400
characters but you can't throw blocking the hit detection is kind of meh you know sometimes your

906
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:36,960
projectiles won't hit depending on what's going on and you can you know corner block somebody just

907
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:44,240
trap them but it's it's average the characters are decently designed you know if a little

908
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:52,400
stereotypical but it's worth mentioning because I mean this is one of the early all-female fighting

909
01:29:52,400 --> 01:30:00,240
games I mean we had the Asuka series you know like Asuka 120% I've done before is a classic game and

910
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:07,720
gals fighter for Neo Geo pocket color so just throwing it out there this could have been one

911
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:16,800
of our originators yeah some people have said it's a very much like some of the Sailor Moon

912
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:21,200
games from the same era well yeah this this particular fighter we're looking at in the video

913
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:25,720
on Twitch right now just straight-up looks like Sailor Moon like it's very interesting well I'm

914
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:33,480
looking up Imagineer to see what else they did the other website is down well and I think it's

915
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:36,880
also just you know even though you kind of highlight this classic game is it's kind of

916
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:42,320
average I think it's still worth noting that you know this comes from an era when everybody was

917
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:46,680
trying to copy Street Fighter you know Street Fighter 2 specifically you know Street Fighter

918
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:51,440
2 was such a huge game especially when it released on the Super Nintendo that literally everybody was

919
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:55,560
trying to copy it and of course there was the whole fighting street or whatever it was called

920
01:30:56,200 --> 01:31:02,680
literally copying it in some ways but you know other types of clones came out and sometimes you

921
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:09,240
know it was like okay make it Street Fighter 2 but like make it for horny boys and that's what

922
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:17,240
this is. I knew the Sailor Moon S game that I had was better than this because it was done by

923
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:24,120
Arc System. I wish I hadn't sold that game it was kind of fun because it had the chibi mood

924
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:28,720
butt smash. I feel like you highlighted that on a previous episode at some point I'm sure you have.

925
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:35,200
But I was like I'm pretty sure that Imagineer didn't do it yeah it was Arc System. And this

926
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:40,600
again coming out of Japan like I remember playing a Dragon Ball Z game I remember playing a Ranma

927
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:45,520
game where I'm a one-half game I remember playing like everybody had to have a fighting game in in

928
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:53,720
this certain like 1991 1992 era like on the Super Nintendo was crazy. But at any rate if you want

929
01:31:54,360 --> 01:32:00,280
average then you're gonna try it and it's cheap you know if you're looking for just something

930
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:05,800
that's a little weird but easy to play or if you're just or if you're just horny for waifu fighting

931
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:12,280
there you go yeah waifu fighting yeah get your waifu fight on. I took that from uh victory today

932
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:18,280
all in on waifu dead with legs up yeah it's uh really it's it's ridiculous like charming it's

933
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:24,520
if or you could just recognize how ridiculous stupid something like this is like you know it's

934
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:30,200
like sometimes you just want to watch a bad movie right like sometimes I want to invite Dark Sakura

935
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:35,720
over so we can watch Showgirls and make fun of it because it's a terrible movie and sometimes

936
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:44,280
we want to just play Pretty Fighter because it's stupid right yeah yeah hold on I'm double checking

937
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:52,920
that yeah developer Sailor Moon asks developer Arc System Works publisher Angel Bandai so it

938
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:59,400
was published by Bandai and developed by Arc System there we go all right bam all right there

939
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:04,040
it is your classic game of the week Pretty Fighter for short um what was the full name again Dark

940
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:11,320
Sakura I missed the full name uh fuck let me get it again pretty fighter no I'll get it hold on it

941
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:21,080
is um uh uh pretty fighter as in school uniform legend of course but I noticed even in the the

942
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:26,840
stripper stage with the gargoyles yes podcast folks that was a real thing we just saw on twitch

943
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:32,040
uh you could see in the background the neon sign said pretty fighter in the back so I guess that's

944
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:37,400
the that's the code name that game's adopted so all right not every game is a winner but we

945
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:42,040
highlight uh the games you should check out just because they have a place in gaming history even

946
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:46,440
if it's the not so great part of history all right it was worth a mention it was worth a mention all

947
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:51,320
right uh until our next segment let's move or until our next classic game segment let's move

948
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:55,480
on with this week's show and some of the other segments we have for tonight how's how's my co-host

949
01:33:55,480 --> 01:34:00,040
Captain Pikachu doing tonight you doing you doing good you hanging in there all right good all right

950
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:06,920
let's move on it's it's very boring in this giant room with nobody else but this camera

951
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:12,440
it's it's the journey of one man going slowly insane while we watch tonight's program

952
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:17,320
all right well y'all on discord help keep me company let's get to some rapid fire news

953
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:27,080
all right so uh this is the most important feature that's being added to no man's sky

954
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:32,440
and that is bobbleheads that's right so they're going to be adding some bobbleheads

955
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:38,200
into the next update here so we've got uh two they're sold by the quicksilver bot

956
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:44,520
uh the first one being it looks like the specialist polo and then priest entity nada

957
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:48,280
are going to be the two that are going to be starting the game they're going to have

958
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:53,400
some new ones created later on but those will be the two that you'll start off with so that's

959
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:57,560
pretty awesome and even have like this cool little video showing it bobbling as you take off

960
01:34:57,720 --> 01:35:03,000
uh the other thing is because you know we're under this whole uh covid 19 situation one of

961
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:08,600
the things that's been affected by that of course is movie theaters and you've seen a lot of these

962
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:15,560
different movies that were just literally released in theaters now coming out um on streaming

963
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:21,880
services so one of these movies that uh came out not too long ago sonic the hedgehog is actually

964
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:27,000
that uh came out not too long ago sonic the hedgehog is actually going to be released on

965
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:33,880
the 31st of march so you can actually stream it to your house for 20 bucks um so that's pretty

966
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:37,240
cool and i know robbie haven't gotten a chance to see the movie is this something that you'd be

967
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:41,880
interested in watching um yeah i want to see it at some point but 20 bucks is a little high for me i

968
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:45,560
mean that is the price of let's say like two movie tickets or i guess in this day and age one and a

969
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:49,800
half movie tickets so the 20 bucks is going to be a great deal like someone in your situation loki

970
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:54,040
where you have a family of four 20 bucks is a deal but for me and i don't think alan is

971
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:58,120
interested in it i mean i guess i'll ask but for me i'd be paying 20 bucks to watch it myself

972
01:35:58,120 --> 01:36:03,480
so and my normal brain goes i'll go over to someone else's house and watch it but i guess

973
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:08,040
i can't really do that right now um so i'm gonna i'm gonna just hold off a little bit and see if

974
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:11,240
the price comes down a little bit you know you have a lot of stuff you have a lot of stuff that's

975
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:17,880
going direct to netflix and disney plus especially with the uh uh frozen 2 was just like all right

976
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:21,320
well since y'all are gonna be stuck at home why not we'll just put out frozen two today

977
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:26,200
and then uh what onward like just came out on digital and they've already said it's gonna be

978
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:30,040
on disney plus in like three weeks or something like that so that's two weeks they have a two

979
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:36,040
week window on that and same with sonic so sonic is going to be coming out later on um in may 19th

980
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:40,040
they're going to do the physical release of that and they're also going to digital rentals that

981
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:44,680
might be a little bit cheaper than twenty dollars but i'll do the want to watch it i'll do the

982
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:48,120
digital rental i don't feel like sonic is a movie i'm going to particularly want to own

983
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:51,160
but i'll if it's like a 499 rental sure i'll do that

984
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:59,560
all right so uh there you go so let me move on uh some of the rapid fire stories i have tonight

985
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:06,440
world of warcraft is offering a 100 experience bonus uh admittedly i haven't played wow in a

986
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:11,080
little bit but i thought this was kind of an interesting way to um you know kind of

987
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:15,720
entice people to check out the game while you know folks are kind of housebound at this point

988
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:21,800
um but uh blizzard has mentioned that from now until april 20th so that's a pretty big window

989
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:27,560
um your warcraft character gets winds of wisdom that means you get a 100 XP bonus the buff is

990
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:34,040
available in battle of azeroth legion and starter edition players if you're playing world warcraft

991
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:40,120
classic you signed up for a grind no xp buff for you so that's that's that um

992
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:46,760
now uh of course you can use this to get your characters all leveled up because uh you know

993
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:50,440
there's going to be a new expansion of world of warcraft coming out i think this fall but one

994
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:54,040
thing i think is interesting to point out is that they're offering this whole like level and get

995
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:59,640
there faster but don't forget your character is going to get squished so remember that the level

996
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:03,880
squish is coming so even if you make it all the way to level what is 120 i think it's the cap

997
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:10,120
right now you're gonna squish all the way down to 50 uh but keep in mind the squish i mean it

998
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:15,240
doesn't mean if you level to 50 and stop you'll carry over as 50 it's kind of like a sliding

999
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:19,480
squish like a level 50 character would be what like probably like level 20 or something once

1000
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:24,520
the squish happens so do keep that in mind but uh yeah you're you are going to be getting 100

1001
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:30,840
xp but uh there's the squish coming so uh don't get too used to being that high a level uh also

1002
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:37,640
in blizzard's world right now they have announced a new overwatch hero uh named echo uh echo is a

1003
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:44,040
new character with sound abilities it's a new dps character uh and is it a dolphin is it a

1004
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:50,760
echo is not a dolphin echo uses a mimicked hero's ultimate ability as well that is interesting

1005
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:56,840
echo is visually and audibly distinguishable from other characters when she i guess i i didn't know

1006
01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:02,600
echo had a gender but apparently echo is she uh echo uh adopts another form uh she cannot clone

1007
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:09,000
the other team's echo though the main weapon is called tri shot so anyway that is all there uh

1008
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:15,160
echo is currently on the ptr that part surprised me because my assumption was that no more heroes

1009
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:24,040
were coming until overwatch 2 um so i would so she's the team fortress 2 spy i guess yeah i

1010
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:28,200
haven't played team fortress 2 in a long time but does the spy clone people's big abilities

1011
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:33,080
because that's what echo does don't remember but i know you can look like the other people so

1012
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:38,040
maybe admittedly i haven't played overwatch in a little while alan still plays it a little bit

1013
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:44,120
um but i haven't checked i he has been playing he's been doing his annual or bi-annual i don't

1014
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:49,000
know like playthrough of the mass effect trilogy and when he plays mass effect he does every side

1015
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:54,760
quest everything so he just got this weekend to mass effect 2 so i don't think he's touched

1016
01:39:54,760 --> 01:40:00,440
overwatch in a little bit because he's on that right now so uh fifth dream today says echo equals

1017
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:06,280
shang tsung that's not a bad comparison because i believe uh shang tsung had his own abilities

1018
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:13,240
but then he could kind of like copy others so that's a pretty good comparison so ss200 matt

1019
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:19,480
says she's ditto she can't copy another ditto you guys are on a roll i guess this is a gaming trope

1020
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:24,920
we've seen several times before uh but not too surprising all right anyway uh dark soccer how

1021
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:33,080
about your rapid fire stories just a couple um so uh for uh people who like free stuff

1022
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:41,160
the epic game store is doing uh watchdogs and stanley parable as freebies so go get them

1023
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:48,120
um and honestly to be perfectly honest the stanley parable is absolutely worth paying anything so

1024
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:53,160
i'll tell you that right now um but yeah go ahead and uh check them out yeah that's one reason i'm

1025
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:57,240
glad we highlighted that tonight because uh i think those games are only available for like

1026
01:40:57,240 --> 01:41:02,440
a week or two so yeah go go grab the stanley parable for sure if you i mean if i realize not

1027
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:05,640
everybody's down with the epic store but if the epic store is installed on your computer and it's

1028
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:10,200
not a problem for you go get the stanley parable and and why not get watchdogs you might as well

1029
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:15,720
right of course some of us already have it on steam and have had it fair but now you'll know

1030
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:25,480
what what we love about it um and so also um uh sony is doing uh a kindness it looks like

1031
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:36,120
i'm starting on monday march 23rd at 11 59 p.m pacific time so um wow i guess that's going to be

1032
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:43,640
yeah late monday um they're releasing both tomb raider and lara croft the the original the 2013

1033
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:51,400
tomb raider and lara croft and the temple of osiris for free on steam um it doesn't does it

1034
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:58,280
say how long that's going to be going for um it doesn't say but um they have instructions on the

1035
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:06,120
square enix site well looks like it's already up now um but at any rate um you can uh

1036
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:11,160
they've got instructions on their site but you go in and you'll buy it for zero dollars and

1037
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:17,640
um you go to your my orders you unlock the activation key and you do all the instructions

1038
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:22,360
so there you go and if you haven't played the tomb raider reboot yet like you know i feel

1039
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:26,440
like that game's been out a while now uh you really should get on it that's that's it's a

1040
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:31,400
really great um reinvention of tomb raider i had a lot of fun with it so it's definitely

1041
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:38,440
worth your time that time is when it ends sorry oh so you gotta really get on that yeah and then

1042
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:43,640
i don't even know if you need to do that because they're free right now on steam because i actually

1043
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:47,880
downloaded them already right that's what steam that's what this is about is that they're free

1044
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:54,520
on steam until tomorrow right exactly yeah their instructions are really like convoluted it's like

1045
01:42:54,520 --> 01:43:00,200
a login to your square enix games account and i think they're having people do it on the website

1046
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:06,600
so it's done might be convincing people to sign up for a square enix account so that they can send

1047
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:11,800
you emails about their upcoming products because that's how i heard about this was i got an email

1048
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:17,320
from square enix because i'm i'm a final fantasy 11 and 14 subscriber and i'm pretty sure i used

1049
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:21,800
their official store at one point to get like a heaven's word collector's edition of final fantasy

1050
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:27,400
14 or something so um yeah now i'm on the mailing list yeah just skip all that just go straight to

1051
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:32,200
steam and just add them to your collection yeah it's easier through the app i think that their

1052
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:40,760
instructions were um uh more pertaining to buying it through the website got it all right well

1053
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:45,240
let's travel around the world and check out the upcoming releases because uh you know there are

1054
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:50,600
still games coming out and especially because so much is digital in this day and age um you know i

1055
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:57,560
don't i i do enjoy my physical copies i'm gonna hope that my final fantasy 7 um re remaster or

1056
01:43:57,560 --> 01:44:02,120
whatever uh re remake i hope the fantasy sim remake i ordered it through amazon so i'm gonna

1057
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:06,760
hope it still shows up on the release day uh i did not get the collector's edition i heard there was

1058
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:12,200
a whole bump but i'm prepared that it might because yes like many of you i have heard that

1059
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:17,320
amazon is shifting some of their priorities and i get it but if we're going to be on house arrest

1060
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:22,360
through the end of april then like i'm not in a huge rush like if i get it a few days late i

1071
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:39,160
know if i heard that but that is out this week on the switch it's important no i i did not say that

1072
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:44,040
like that's what we need right now is mama to fix it because we've got a fucking mess going on

1073
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:49,400
we need mama to fix it so anyway something to think about all right well i'll travel to japan

1074
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:54,040
here uh and check out the japanese releases of which uh there's just a couple things this week

1075
01:45:54,040 --> 01:46:00,280
on the switch one piece pirate warriors 4 is out this week revenge of justice is also out and on

1076
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:05,640
the nintendo switch space invaders invincible collection i have no idea what that is it looks

1077
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:10,680
like there's a whole like it comes with a space invaders switch game uh and a whole bunch of like

1078
01:46:10,680 --> 01:46:15,480
little collectibles thing and keep in mind the space invaders phenomenon like that a lot of that

1079
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:21,560
was japan like there was it was huge there it's it's really a part of their culture um it does

1080
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:27,240
come with the space invaders original from 1978 it comes with space invaders part two space invaders

1081
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:33,800
91 and space invaders extreme that's pretty cool as well as space invaders dx space cyclone lunar

1082
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:37,960
rescue and apparently more to come with that so that's a pretty cool collection i wonder if that's

1083
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:42,280
coming out here in the states at some point but the space invaders invincible collection is coming

1084
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:46,840
out this week in japan on the switch now looking at the playstation 4 real quick we see a lot of

1085
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:51,880
overlap because revenge of justice is out there as well as well as one piece pirate warriors 4

1086
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:57,400
that's basically just collection not out on ps4 though but playstation 4 does also have

1087
01:46:57,400 --> 01:47:05,080
uh keniro lover ishi is coming out this week and life is strange 2 getting its japanese release

1088
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:08,520

1089
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:13,800

1090
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:15,240
um how about the uk dark soccer

and uh to our next story loki

1107
01:48:58,440 --> 01:49:05,320
all right so uh we were just talking about some free games and so of course it's nice to see that

1108
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:11,240
there's some more free games you can play um steam is doing this the steam game festival spring

1109
01:49:11,240 --> 01:49:19,960
edition between now and the 23rd and with that you can test out uh 59 games that are part of

1110
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:26,600
their kind of indie showcase um so these were some from indie mega booth wings fun indie mix

1111
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:33,320
data devs and you can check them out uh some of the more notable ones i saw in there let's see

1112
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:41,000
here there's a long list um i don't know there's some pretty cool games like uh skate bird that

1113
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:47,160
was one that was pretty cool i know i've been following them on twitter um what was the other

1114
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:58,120
ones uh there's a game called coffee talk kung fu kickball clang 2 uh giant silent bob mall brawl

1115
01:49:58,680 --> 01:50:07,320
um that's kind of interesting and yeah so lots of uh different demos you can check out um granted

1116
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:11,960
you want to do it sooner than later because you know time is running out but i imagine that more

1117
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:15,720
these types of things are going to be available i know there is even a curated list that someone

1118
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:21,800
did of um different games that have been available and like even all these different game jams are

1119
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:28,040
going on they have one about uh the whole covid19 stuff about staying inside and um there's a pretty

1120
01:50:28,040 --> 01:50:34,680
funny one about feeding animals at a park and you're this old guy and you have to feed the

1121
01:50:34,680 --> 01:50:39,800
animals the right food and then if they get too uppity on you you hit them with your stick so i

1122
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:44,920
thought that was hilarious um so yeah check it out um you know lots of different free games even

1123
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:49,240
on hiio and stuff but uh this would be a cool place to check out some of these indie games that

1124
01:50:49,240 --> 01:50:55,960
were shown off and some of these festivals that actually been closed coffee talk the game neither

1125
01:50:55,960 --> 01:51:01,080
about coffee nor talking discuss no i actually don't know what that game is about but uh i

1126
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:04,760
couldn't help but think of that since we're gonna bring up saturday night live on this show old

1127
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:11,800
school from the 90s dana carvey and then mike myers and coffee talk so all right um

1128
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:16,120
i will have to check out some of the games i had no idea there was a jay and silent bob game

1129
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:21,960
in that expo i have to check that out yeah i'm assuming that ties in with the new movie which i

1130
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:31,400
did get that chance to watch the movie this week and uh it's okay it's it's all right

1131
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:32,200
all right

1132
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:42,360
all right well let's move on and uh talk about uh this samsung story so samsung uh is actually

1133
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:50,440
going to be closing their pc to mobile service uh samsung is um uh and it kind of strikes a chord

1134
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:54,360
right now because i feel like nvidia has like a similar thing going on i mean i know it's not

1135
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:57,880
pc to mobile it's like a different thing but i feel like a lot of these things are under the

1136
01:51:57,880 --> 01:52:02,600
microscope right now but samsung is going to be closing their service on march the 27th

1137
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:08,440
so uh play galaxy link allowed you to play pc games on your phone um so they are shutting down

1138
01:52:08,440 --> 01:52:14,360
the game streaming service on uh march 27th sadly they didn't say why just internal policy changes

1139
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:17,800
but i couldn't help but wonder if some of the stuff we've watched is happening to in video with

1140
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:21,800
something i wonder if some of that was coming into play i don't know but they didn't confirm or deny

1141
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:29,080
any of that they're just saying they want to more effectively refocus its resources um also of note

1142
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:34,280
samsung has also noted that they're teaming up with microsoft on a game streaming experience

1143
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:40,360
that'll show up later in 2020 could it be that samsung is somehow involved with xcloud or

1144
01:52:40,360 --> 01:52:45,640
something along those lines we have yet to see but that is something that is uh looking like

1145
01:52:45,640 --> 01:52:51,320
it could be in the um future for samsung but for now their current service is going to be going

1146
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:57,640
away um moving on to talk quickly about a third-party app that actually will make your

1147
01:52:57,640 --> 01:53:05,160
smartphone into a virtual joycon so let's say you uh lose your joycon or you want another one or

1148
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:09,480
something like that it's interesting uh there's apparently an app out there and right now it's

1149
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:13,960
only on android but who knows if it's allowed to stick around maybe it'll show up other places too

1150
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:21,000
uh the android uh phone has a game call or an app called joycon droid and it will allow your phone

1151
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:27,560
to be a virtual joycon um it'll work but it's probably you know again keep in mind the actual

1152
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:33,800
joy cons have a lot more tech inside them that your phones don't actually have so while it might

1153
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:39,160
help you like have a buzzer in a game or something like that i wouldn't really want to use this to

1154
01:53:39,160 --> 01:53:46,280
play every game but it's it might work for animal crossing heck so there is that all right just a

1155
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:50,600
couple more stories for you guys before we get to uh listener round table which tonight is just

1156
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:54,200
going to be exclusive to our chat room so if you have questions you might want to start putting

1157
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:59,000
those out in our chat room uh so like i was going to say with that whole joycon thing that's a

1158
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:02,680
pretty good idea just for like even like mario party or something like that so you have your

1159
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:08,040
friends over and like you don't want to buy 80 you know pairs of controllers so you just have

1160
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:13,080
a joycon for each person just grab a bunch of phones and set it up that way well you know one

1161
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:17,320
thing that missed our show world tonight was the whole uh intellivision trailer that came out so

1162
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:21,080
intellivision put out a new trailer right bobby talked about this on his show a little bit

1163
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:25,960
and i'd seen the trailer earlier in the week and the whole like controller via smartphone app i

1164
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:30,040
believe that's something intellivision confirmed they want to do so that way you know because

1165
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:35,400
they're trying to be very big on multiplayer gaming in the same room uh family game night

1166
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:39,560
type of things and it would make a lot of sense like oh hey i only have two controllers you know

1167
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:43,160
what instead of charging families money to go buy an extra controller well they can do that if they

1168
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:46,920
want for the collectability or whatever but you can use a smartphone maybe if it's something that

1169
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:51,640
you aren't gonna use very often or something like that so it's kind of interesting it's like a

1170
01:54:51,640 --> 01:54:57,400
similar idea that's kind of baked into the system and then of course you can't help but think about

1171
01:54:57,400 --> 01:55:03,640
jackbox party pack where i feel like the whole smartphone controller thing really started i mean

1172
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:07,160
sure i think we've always had mods and and all these types of things but i i feel like that

1173
01:55:07,160 --> 01:55:12,120
really took off with jackbox party pack which those games are having a real i don't know if

1174
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:16,680
you guys have noticed but i noticed those games are showing up everywhere right now um with this

1175
01:55:16,680 --> 01:55:21,960
situation a lot of friends of mine um staying in touch by playing those games over the internet

1176
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:28,120
since they're so easy to really pick up and go so kind of interesting all right well anyhow

1177
01:55:28,120 --> 01:55:32,040
let's move on uh loki you got another story for us before we get to listen to round table

1178
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:40,600
yeah so this is interesting so uh we had of course the whole reveal of some of the specs of the

1179
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:49,000
xbox series x last week and then of course this week we then get major nelson putting out a tweet

1180
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:55,720
about a release date now he said that you know an xbox product page in some regions um you know

1181
01:55:55,720 --> 01:56:03,320
originally they had uh said there was showing a holiday or a thanksgiving 2020 release of course

1182
01:56:04,120 --> 01:56:08,360
come to find out that's not necessarily true he's actually clarified that it's

1183
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:14,040
just holiday right now so whoops we accidentally uh put a release date where there is none so

1184
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:18,680
i mean i'm assuming it'll come out around that time but it hasn't been confirmed yet yeah i

1185
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:21,880
think it's one of those things where people are reading into it nobody's gonna launch a console

1186
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:26,920
on a holiday like that and even even with the controversial stores being open on thanksgiving

1187
01:56:26,920 --> 01:56:30,680
and that whole stuff like they're not they're not gonna launch a console on that day but i think

1188
01:56:30,680 --> 01:56:35,560
that gives you an idea oh that's around the time frame which of course it's around the time frame

1189
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:41,640
they're gonna launch the console uh almost almost big almost every console has launched in november

1190
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:46,840
one of the big exceptions of course being the switch which launched in the spring um but it

1191
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:52,920
looks like microsoft is still targeting that fall holiday time frame and kind of confirming that in

1192
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:58,920
light of everything that's going on in the world with covid now um it could still get pushed back

1193
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:04,520
i wouldn't be shocked at all if something like playstation 5 or xbox uh x gets pushed back to

1194
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:10,680
spring next year even further back depending on what's happening but um you know uh that's

1195
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:14,360
certainly what they're aiming for and i don't think that's a huge surprise right and that could

1196
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:19,560
have been the original plan that it was going to be thanksgiving but uh or around that time but you

1197
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:24,920
never know with the way supply chains are now and with everyone not working because of everything

1198
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:30,840
it's it's hard to say i mean it's still a wait we'll see there's still a long way to go to see

1199
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:35,560
kind of like what the the where all the cards kind of land and it really just depends on how

1200
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:41,320
long does this go on you know so we'll see all right well moving on to talk about uh google

1201
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:46,920
stadia and kind of the first discount for google stadia for the hardware and i'm using my quotee

1202
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:51,800
fingers because again i think we all know generally the the actual concept of stadia is that you're

1203
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:56,280
not going to need hardware for google stadia you'll be able to play it in a browser but

1204
01:57:56,280 --> 01:58:02,520
the google stadia starter pack has gotten a discount so uh and it was just in time for

1205
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:07,960
doom eternal which is something that you can play on stadia if you like so uh it was just a one day

1206
01:58:07,960 --> 01:58:13,560
i think it was today or it was earlier this week uh was the sale so i'm not sure you can still take

1207
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:18,680
advantage of it unfortunately but it's still worth highlighting because it is a sale already

1208
01:58:18,680 --> 01:58:23,800
on stadia hardware so just take that what it is but they had knocked down the price to 99

1209
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:31,880
instead of 129 and that was the controller the chrome cast ultra and three months of stadia pro

1210
01:58:31,880 --> 01:58:36,760
so um i don't know if anybody took advantage of that because of doom eternal or if anybody's

1211
01:58:36,760 --> 01:58:43,480
been playing uh doom eternal on google stadia but uh that is available so i'm still curious to see

1212
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:50,280
what happens with a um you know browser launch and kind of the launch for stadia for other platforms

1213
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:55,160
i got a chrome cast uh or excuse me not a chrome cast a chrome book that's not doing a heck of a

1214
01:58:55,160 --> 01:59:00,200
lot right now uh it's pretty much an electric blanket for mr smoosh so um i would be very

1215
01:59:00,200 --> 01:59:04,840
curious to see what stadia would look like on a system like that because you know that's where

1216
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:09,640
i think the street you know because obviously those things don't run a lot but if stadia is

1217
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:14,600
mostly streaming it might kind of look games might look pretty good on there for for certain things

1218
01:59:14,600 --> 01:59:20,680
so we'll see but i imagine everything that's going on in the world again has google reassessing a lot

1219
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:27,480
of those types of things and some folks in chat commenting on uh yes mr smoosh was getting picked

1220
01:59:27,480 --> 01:59:32,280
up in the background because uh his other dad decided that now is a great time to open up one

1221
01:59:32,280 --> 01:59:37,080
of those smelly cans of food and so smoosh comes running because he smells the food uh and uh yeah

1222
01:59:37,080 --> 01:59:41,480
as 200 matt saying smoosh has thoughts on that topic he thinks the xbox should be released on

1223
01:59:41,480 --> 01:59:46,440
thanksgiving so he can eat some turkey while everybody is playing the new console yeah fair

1224
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:52,200
enough fair enough all right well uh this is the part of the show where we would get to the listener

1225
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:56,760
round table uh if you guys have questions in chat for us go ahead and ask them over at twitch tv

1226
01:59:56,760 --> 02:00:01,960
slash vog network uh for tonight we are going to forego discord because we're using discord

1227
02:00:01,960 --> 02:00:06,920
to connect us uh to the show right now um so we're going to forego that for now but if you

1228
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:10,840
do have general questions or comments you can put those in our chat room and we'll be reading some

1229
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:17,400
of those on here uh pod culture in chat says bring smoosh on cam uh i would love to but that

1230
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:23,640
requires me leaving cam to go get him and he just dug into his food he's not gonna want to leave

1231
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:27,640
that he'll be very unhappy if i take him away from that so you're gonna sadly have to give him

1232
02:00:27,640 --> 02:00:32,200
a little while and the show will probably be done by the time he's ready because you know he has to

1233
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:37,160
chow it all down and he's gonna be you know he's gonna sit down and be fat for a little bit

1234
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:44,600
then kind of go over and drink a little bit of water and all that good stuff so anyway um i

1235
02:00:44,600 --> 02:00:48,360
don't know if you guys have any last minute stories while we wait and see if anybody's got

1236
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:56,760
questions or comments for us in chat um sure i do so uh since of course everybody is canceling all

1237
02:00:56,760 --> 02:01:03,800
sports uh one of those sports that's been affected by that is formula one and so because of that

1238
02:01:03,800 --> 02:01:09,480
formula one has announced that f1 esports virtual grand prix series is going to be a thing that

1239
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:15,240
happens this year and with that they're going to have a number of the current f1 drivers playing

1240
02:01:15,240 --> 02:01:23,240
the official codemasters game f1 2019 and on pc in having that broadcast worldwide in lieu of the

1241
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:28,840
races that's kind of neat um and bobby was talking a little bit on a show about i don't know if it

1242
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:36,120
was this or something similar but apparently there was some racing esports on tv today because

1243
02:01:36,120 --> 02:01:40,600
today was supposed to be a nascar day and it's kind of kind of an interesting situation with

1244
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:45,880
the world that we're in all these sporting events are getting cancelled so what are the tv stations

1245
02:01:45,880 --> 02:01:52,360
going to show uh and so some i'm sure some are doing movies of the week and so forth but uh some

1246
02:01:52,360 --> 02:01:59,640
are showing esports events so if you can't do nascar why not do e nascar i think yes and then

1247
02:01:59,640 --> 02:02:07,400
as bobby's putting it uh espn 2 is doing the ocho so they had a lot of um crazy different events

1248
02:02:07,400 --> 02:02:13,000
in there i know uh one of the like marble racing that they do on youtube was one of the things that

1249
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:19,560
they are showing in there they're the tetris uh championships i want to say they were doing like

1250
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:24,360
some sort of eating contest at one point axe throwing or something i don't know it's all

1251
02:02:24,360 --> 02:02:31,560
sorts of fun stuff almost makes me wish i had espn uh and nascar's was the i racing was the name of

1252
02:02:31,560 --> 02:02:37,800
that game that they were um doing on uh tv um here's a comment uh from chat uh or question

1253
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:42,920
act deaf says i got a question with this quarantine taking place do you think twitch

1254
02:02:42,920 --> 02:02:48,120
streaming will now be something that people start doing now well not only twitch but you get the

1255
02:02:48,120 --> 02:02:54,440
idea um absolutely um i think twitch is a very interesting way for people to kind of keep in

1256
02:02:54,440 --> 02:03:02,280
touch um i also notice our numbers for viewing are up slightly tonight i mean not a ton but

1257
02:03:02,280 --> 02:03:07,880
they're up slightly tonight because all the usual things that we're up against such as sporting

1258
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:14,760
events uh and so forth are are cancelled um i'm you'd be surprised i'm not happy about that

1259
02:03:14,760 --> 02:03:19,320
because i kind of like the way the world used to be um i understand why we're in this scenario and

1260
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:25,800
so forth um so i guess i'll take it but um yeah i think more people are drawn to twitch because

1261
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:31,560
people are making original content out of their homes um and i think there are a lot of big

1262
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:38,440
personalities out there and so forth where when you know the with when to create content for twitch

1263
02:03:39,320 --> 02:03:44,440
or youtube or a lot of stuff all you really need is yourself and a camera you don't necessarily

1264
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:50,600
need a big uh film crew to be able to make that kind of stuff so i think that space is where

1265
02:03:50,600 --> 02:03:58,920
you're gonna see content now that doesn't mean it's all gonna be good content because i talked

1266
02:03:58,920 --> 02:04:04,280
earlier about the youtubers that blew the sony stuff way out of proportion and that's part of

1267
02:04:04,280 --> 02:04:09,800
what i think we're gonna miss about the professional filmmakers and the professional stuff is that that

1268
02:04:09,800 --> 02:04:14,440
kind of quality level not to say the indie stuff is bad i would not want to shoot ourselves on the

1269
02:04:14,440 --> 02:04:20,520
foot like that but there is a certain type of uh quality process we'll say that goes with that

1270
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:26,040
professional caliber of uh streaming and television production and so forth that i think some of us

1271
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:32,600
will start to miss the longer that this goes on but um television survived the writer's strike

1272
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:38,120
it'll survive this too um not everything survived the writer's strike though remember remember the

1273
02:04:38,120 --> 02:04:45,000
tv shows heroes when it was good yeah uh i know you know it's funny i watched the uh show on

1274
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:50,920
netflix actually this week called freaks that kind of reminded me of like a pilot for a hero

1275
02:04:50,920 --> 02:04:55,080
type show it was actually pretty cool so hey that's something you guys could watch you know

1276
02:04:55,080 --> 02:05:00,440
it says uh everyone's got a lot of free time now i guess um some other great questions from chat

1277
02:05:00,440 --> 02:05:04,920
sia tabiri is asking where in the world is carmen san diego was mentioned in the convo about the

1278
02:05:04,920 --> 02:05:10,840
hall of fame topic uh any thoughts on the best carmen san diego tv series adaptation

1279
02:05:10,840 --> 02:05:16,840
where in the world versus where on earth the cartoon versus where in time the tv show uh later

1280
02:05:16,840 --> 02:05:20,760
one i know it's a tangent but it's a fun conversation i have to be honest i haven't really

1281
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:25,640
seen the netflix specials so the only thing i know of when it comes to television and where in the

1282
02:05:25,640 --> 02:05:32,120
world is carmen san diego is the old pbs game show uh with the the the rockafellas singing the theme

1283
02:05:32,120 --> 02:05:38,760
song and all that stuff and i i i i don't go ahead i played a lot on a map on the first mac

1284
02:05:38,760 --> 02:05:44,520
came out in 1984 i played a lot of it and then i played where in time where in time for me was

1285
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:50,520
more fun because it was history too um sia tabiri is curious about the tv adaptations though if you

1286
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:58,280
have a particular favorite i didn't really watch much of any of them i would just do the themes

1287
02:05:58,840 --> 02:06:07,640
go do my day yeah i think i watched the original like um the carmen san diego show i don't think

1288
02:06:07,640 --> 02:06:14,120
i've seen where in time but the original was all right yeah uh yeah i like the game show it was a

1289
02:06:14,120 --> 02:06:18,680
lot of fun i like pbs had a lot of really good shows in the 90s but that just might be you know

1290
02:06:18,680 --> 02:06:25,320
my my kid slash teen voice coming through i don't know uh what do we get in the twitch marathon of

1291
02:06:25,320 --> 02:06:30,920
like three two one contact and stuff like all that like nothing is off the table for how people

1292
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:37,560
are going to resolve their boredom so stay tuned anyway um let's see uh quest buster says as a

1293
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:43,080
tangent on the streaming note more people are definitely heading online to play steam logged

1294
02:06:43,080 --> 02:06:47,080
its highest number of concurrent users last week if i recall correctly yeah we had a story about

1295
02:06:47,080 --> 02:06:51,720
that briefly last week that steam reached an all-time high and they're probably gonna keep

1296
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:57,000
those numbers are gonna keep going up and up unlike the stock market wamp wamp but yeah those

1297
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:03,480
numbers are probably gonna keep climbing um let's see uh s200 matt says the entertainment industry

1298
02:07:03,480 --> 02:07:11,400
will bounce back some of your local businesses may not yeah it's a very um very real prospect

1299
02:07:11,400 --> 02:07:17,640
um so you know those of you that have the income to be able to spend on things like local businesses

1300
02:07:17,640 --> 02:07:21,400
i hope you're planning to do so when those businesses open back up or if they're serving

1301
02:07:21,400 --> 02:07:27,240
food to go right now those are great places to support um so i was going to mention real quick

1302
02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:33,400
about the twitch traffic so they are saying that um overall year over year there's been a three

1303
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:41,000
percent increase in new accounts on twitch and then 15 increase over the last few days of

1304
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:46,440
streaming on twitch wow i'm not surprised this is the time where people pick up a new hobby and

1305
02:07:46,440 --> 02:07:51,800
things like that you know and that's uh to pass the time and i'm i'm all for it you know somebody

1306
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:56,040
we might have some great new voices out there that uh haven't been heard yet that will be through all

1307
02:07:56,040 --> 02:08:01,480
this um tiger claw mentioning the funny thing is i've been doing the whole self-isolation thing for

1308
02:08:01,480 --> 02:08:05,240
years with friends living in another state and some relatives in another city i've been alone

1309
02:08:05,240 --> 02:08:10,520
for most of my life so if i wanted to play games with someone i can only be via online you know and

1310
02:08:10,520 --> 02:08:15,080
that's a running gag if you will i'm using my quotey fingers since i don't know if it's really

1311
02:08:15,080 --> 02:08:20,200
a gag but that this is the moment that introverts have been preparing for is kind of like a line

1312
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:24,680
that i hear around uh the internet and you know again i don't i don't want to be insensitive or

1313
02:08:24,680 --> 02:08:30,360
rude but i definitely think there are like some personalities that are totally okay with like

1314
02:08:30,360 --> 02:08:35,080
what's going on right now and that's or you know what i mean like are able to adapt easier we'll

1315
02:08:35,080 --> 02:08:39,000
say that because like like you said tiger claw that this is something you're kind of used to

1316
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:45,560
anyway um this is this is a challenge for me i'm gonna be honest this whole thing is it's hard

1317
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:50,360
because i'm a little bit more extroverted by nature i like to be around go out with people

1318
02:08:50,360 --> 02:08:54,600
do stuff on the weekend even if it's just i'm going out to a restaurant with alan and even if

1319
02:08:54,600 --> 02:08:58,040
it's just us or meeting one or two other people like those are the types of things i like to do

1320
02:08:58,040 --> 02:09:04,760
and like i know we're only a week in barely but i can kind of like already feel it i'm like dang

1321
02:09:04,760 --> 02:09:11,000
this is if this goes on for eight weeks it's gonna be hard um i've already been this way for

1322
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:17,720
a week yeah honestly it's been beautiful yeah but that's right but that's your personality and my

1323
02:09:17,720 --> 02:09:23,240
personality i'm saying yeah the thing is is that now it's kind of like what introverts go through

1324
02:09:23,240 --> 02:09:32,280
in reverse or what people with autism like me go through in reverse you're now in our comfort zone

1325
02:09:32,840 --> 02:09:40,440
and it's been i don't really have anything to offer people in those circumstances other than

1326
02:09:40,440 --> 02:09:46,840
that i think that for some of us who are more adapted to this kind of thing we need to be there

1327
02:09:46,840 --> 02:09:56,040
for the people who aren't i think that's fair so um anyway uh where else i'm looking some folks are

1328
02:09:56,040 --> 02:09:59,880
talking about i knew somebody that was on the carmen san diego game show it's kind of fun uh

1329
02:09:59,880 --> 02:10:04,440
fifth dream today says yeah my life definitely less impacted than most because i have social

1330
02:10:04,440 --> 02:10:11,080
anxiety or other reasons i just stay home as much as possible sure um oh she hulk says support your

1331
02:10:11,080 --> 02:10:15,240
local podcast as well like olr with some biddies thank you so much for that she hulk really

1332
02:10:15,240 --> 02:10:21,160
appreciate that um s2100 matt says i do hate the narrative that was floating around that this

1333
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:26,440
whole thing was karma to jocks with sports being cancelled what bothers me is that plenty of people

1334
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:31,320
who work in sports that aren't jocks or are gamers like everyone else um here's the thing

1335
02:10:32,360 --> 02:10:36,360
with all that stuff you know and i've heard the crap about boomer doomer and all this other

1336
02:10:36,360 --> 02:10:43,400
bullshit as well let's keep something in mind human beings have the capability of discriminating

1337
02:10:44,200 --> 02:10:50,120
viruses don't discriminate and y'all better keep that in the forefront of your mind as to why we're

1338
02:10:50,120 --> 02:10:55,000
all doing this whole self-isolation and all this stuff i mean yes maybe the statistics are showing

1339
02:10:55,000 --> 02:11:02,200
that less younger people are um being as severely impacted but that doesn't mean every everybody

1340
02:11:02,200 --> 02:11:08,200
who's young is immune because this virus doesn't discriminate viruses can't discriminate you know

1341
02:11:08,200 --> 02:11:14,040
any sense so and if i may jock and boomer also it doesn't fucking matter when it comes to a virus

1342
02:11:14,040 --> 02:11:21,160
yeah please and for everyone complaining about the shelter in place you know people can still

1343
02:11:21,160 --> 02:11:25,080
get their necessities they can leave for those things but i want to put this

1344
02:11:25,080 --> 02:11:31,000
into perspective um in fact someone actually just posted this on twitter and i'm going to steal it

1345
02:11:31,720 --> 02:11:37,960
and frank lived in a practical closet for two years you can endure the next 10 weeks

1346
02:11:38,840 --> 02:11:45,320
yeah i i you know i i'm gonna sit here and say it sucks but i'm gonna recognize it's what has

1347
02:11:45,320 --> 02:11:52,040
to be done and i'll get by you know luckily i have a show like olr to kind of be an outlet of sorts

1348
02:11:52,040 --> 02:11:57,240
you'd think i would be doing more personal streaming but i'm gonna give you a very honest

1349
02:11:57,240 --> 02:12:03,000
answer on that um you'd think i would do more personal streaming but kind of like the opposite

1350
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:09,480
effect is kind of happening is that because i'm not really able to go out and be social

1351
02:12:10,280 --> 02:12:18,040
i can't really get the energy to do that during the week as well olr is kind of the type of thing

1352
02:12:18,040 --> 02:12:22,680
where i've been doing it every week for so long it's like it's just like a habit like it's like

1353
02:12:22,680 --> 02:12:27,560
it's it's like ingrained into my dna right now at this point um this show is old enough to fucking

1354
02:12:27,560 --> 02:12:32,440
vote pretty much uh so that's you know kind of like where where olr is at but like when it comes

1355
02:12:32,440 --> 02:12:38,360
to like the impromptu streaming stuff like it's not as easy for me to do that so that's why i'm

1356
02:12:38,360 --> 02:12:43,480
being very supportive of like other people who are thriving in what's going on right now you

1357
02:12:43,480 --> 02:12:47,960
know like dark soccer to use you as an example you've kind of said that and you streamed for

1358
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:52,840
the first time in quite some time a couple days ago and you kind of have more a desire to do that

1359
02:12:52,840 --> 02:12:58,840
and so i kind of see my role right now as because i am having a hard time and i've got to use my

1360
02:12:58,840 --> 02:13:04,520
energy focusing on not going crazy um i support dark soccer and what she's doing and i support

1361
02:13:04,520 --> 02:13:12,040
all of the rest of you that want to go out and create content so um other comments in chat um

1362
02:13:12,680 --> 02:13:17,320
fifth dream today says by shelter in place they mean stop waving your dick in public going you

1363
02:13:17,320 --> 02:13:22,200
can't tell me what to do and you don't need to buy a car new shoes and have a wedding this week

1364
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:27,960
yeah all those things will be waiting for you uh in the summertime hopefully um s2100 matt says i

1365
02:13:27,960 --> 02:13:32,040
went for a senior drive yesterday i wanted to do something that was wasn't around people but also

1366
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:38,600
got me out of the house i love driving uh i find it relaxing so a nice scenic drive filled that

1367
02:13:38,600 --> 02:13:44,920
void i needed yeah uh and that sounds like a great i might try to do something like that next weekend

1368
02:13:44,920 --> 02:13:49,880
but the the only challenge i see with that is that i also think a lot of those places where people

1369
02:13:49,880 --> 02:13:55,320
would usually go like let's say the established trails and things like that are probably going to

1370
02:13:55,320 --> 02:13:59,800
be very busy and it's going to be very hard to do social distancing at places like that but i know

1371
02:13:59,800 --> 02:14:03,960
in your case i think you said you picked more of a random type of place to go to and that probably

1372
02:14:03,960 --> 02:14:11,080
worked out a lot better um i have been like going to the parks nearby i'm trying to go out once a

1373
02:14:11,080 --> 02:14:15,160
day to walk around the park i wasn't successful with that every day last week but maybe i'll do

1374
02:14:15,160 --> 02:14:19,160
better this week uh trying to go just like do a lap around the park and so forth so i'm getting

1375
02:14:19,160 --> 02:14:23,960
a little vitamin d every day and then like i went out to the bigger park i live near just to like

1376
02:14:23,960 --> 02:14:30,120
go play ingress and it's weird because like right now i could really give a shit about ingress and

1377
02:14:30,120 --> 02:14:35,720
like the the whole fielding and the scoring and the who's gonna throw a megan on i i don't give

1378
02:14:35,720 --> 02:14:41,000
a shit because there's more important things right now but yet i did find some odd little comfort

1379
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:46,440
that like the uh park near me was kind of blue and i was like oh this gives me a little something to

1380
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:51,560
do and i can keep six feet away from other people while i do it okay i did my thing i got outside i

1381
02:14:51,560 --> 02:14:56,360
got my vitamin d i'll go back home now so and rob yeah i can't do those things

1382
02:14:58,040 --> 02:15:04,280
oh yeah yeah i'm going out to check my mail is the most i go outside

1383
02:15:06,040 --> 02:15:10,360
and that that makes perfect sense i mean and when i was going through the swine flu thing years ago

1384
02:15:10,360 --> 02:15:16,760
it was kind of a similar sort of thing but it also helped in that situation to know it was only for a

1385
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:24,200
week and this might go on a lot longer but you know hopefully um yeah i don't know when i'm going

1386
02:15:24,200 --> 02:15:30,840
to get better or when i'm going to hear from my doctor they're not seeing anybody in person they're

1387
02:15:30,840 --> 02:15:41,400
doing as much to treat people over the phone or um by email and keep people out of the hospitals

1388
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:45,800
yeah because with all the people who could possibly have this disease in the hospital

1389
02:15:45,800 --> 02:15:50,760
they want to keep the hospitals free for that but yeah there's a covid doesn't stop everything else

1390
02:15:50,760 --> 02:15:55,240
that could go wrong you know i could still have an accident at home where i slip and break my leg

1391
02:15:55,240 --> 02:15:59,880
and it's gonna you know it's gonna be gonna be rough so they're gonna be like learn to split

1392
02:15:59,880 --> 02:16:06,920
bitch yeah right so yeah all right we'll mail you some coding here you go yeah all right well

1393
02:16:06,920 --> 02:16:11,160
anyway um for now i think we'll go ahead and kind of wrap up with that uh unless loki i don't know

1394
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:13,640
if you have any other last minute stories you want to mention before we wrap up here

1395
02:16:13,640 --> 02:16:22,120
um yeah i was gonna say there's a few more games that are free right now so you should check uh

1396
02:16:22,120 --> 02:16:27,000
check them out on steam uh the first one being droffle 2 is free until april 10th

1397
02:16:27,640 --> 02:16:32,920
and goat of duty is free until march 31st so go check those out

1398
02:16:37,320 --> 02:16:42,200
sorry for the silence i was answering a question in chat there so all right yay more free stuff

1399
02:16:42,200 --> 02:16:46,680
maybe there'll be even more free stuff in the next week who knows we'll see so um all right

1400
02:16:46,680 --> 02:16:50,920
i think with that we will probably wrap things up for the night here uh at the voice geeks network

1401
02:16:50,920 --> 02:16:55,800
and here at orange lounge radio but we will be back in seven days to do it all again uh as far

1402
02:16:55,800 --> 02:17:00,360
as we know at least until at least until early april the show is probably going to be like this

1403
02:17:00,360 --> 02:17:04,440
for a little bit so um hope you guys enjoyed it nonetheless even though we weren't all in the same

1404
02:17:04,440 --> 02:17:08,520
room but i think we were still able to bring you a lot of the stuff that you would expect from a

1405
02:17:08,520 --> 02:17:13,640
usual edition olr um but let's go around and get everybody's final thought before we wrap up for

1406
02:17:13,640 --> 02:17:18,760
the night uh dark soccer do you have any final thoughts to leave our folks with tonight i would

1407
02:17:18,760 --> 02:17:25,720
like to be able to speak without being winded very much well thank you for um going through

1408
02:17:25,720 --> 02:17:30,520
the show tonight but do i mean hopefully in seven days this isn't as much of a problem but

1409
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:35,240
do feel if you need to go like go like take care of yourself don't don't do the dumb thing i did

1410
02:17:35,240 --> 02:17:39,720
and make my make my strep throat worse by hosting two shows over valentine's day weekend

1411
02:17:39,720 --> 02:17:44,440
which i still have a cough from because of that and every time i cough like i feel the looks

1412
02:17:44,440 --> 02:17:50,360
coming on when i'm at the park or something like that so well i've been i've been taking it pretty

1413
02:17:50,360 --> 02:17:57,000
easy dan's gotten used to reading my my gestures that aren't all you know a single raised digit

1414
02:17:58,520 --> 02:18:03,320
and we've got fresh bread it was honestly breaking baking bread last night set me off

1415
02:18:03,320 --> 02:18:09,160
which is usually a stress relief for me because you know i get to beat the crap out of some dough

1416
02:18:09,880 --> 02:18:13,560
and it's delicious when i'm done it's still delicious don't get me wrong

1417
02:18:14,120 --> 02:18:21,960
but i was a mess afterwards just baking bread so all right well everyone take care of yourself

1418
02:18:21,960 --> 02:18:28,360
listen to the signs ret let's listen to doctors uh rest up feel better and uh we'll hope we'll

1419
02:18:28,440 --> 02:18:30,600
hope when we talk to you in seven days you're doing much better okay

1420
02:18:32,040 --> 02:18:35,880
thank you you're welcome uh loki any final thoughts tonight

1421
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:42,840
i just found out that apparently you can use the toilets in animal crossing

1422
02:18:44,600 --> 02:18:49,000
that's interesting i guess you actually always been able to use the toilet since the first one

1423
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:53,400
yeah but he didn't but i don't believe in every single game he's like and that takes

1424
02:18:53,400 --> 02:18:58,840
care of that with the flushing they've always had the flushing that's funny that takes care

1425
02:18:58,840 --> 02:19:04,920
of that that's funny um i need a super toilet now yeah and actually spoiler alert one of the

1426
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:12,120
early rewards you get is toilet paper it's almost like animal crossing foretold the future why do

1427
02:19:12,120 --> 02:19:19,320
you talk to me like this all right y'all really added toilet paper like for real no i was smart

1428
02:19:19,480 --> 02:19:24,680
bought um an extra pack before things got crazy although we were getting low on paper towels so

1429
02:19:24,680 --> 02:19:30,360
i had to get some industrial paper towels and so i got these really weird looking brown things that

1430
02:19:30,360 --> 02:19:35,960
you would normally find in like an office calm oh yeah dan's actually still been uh dealing with

1431
02:19:35,960 --> 02:19:43,640
his mom's place and there was a stash of toilet paper paper towels and cleaning supplies nice

1432
02:19:44,520 --> 02:19:49,000
yeah so yeah and i i heard some of the stores restocked today so i think and i think people

1433
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:53,880
are calming down a little bit so hopefully that stuff is not going to be as well they're also

1434
02:19:53,880 --> 02:19:59,640
putting like restrictions on stuff and i know like when i went over i had to go grocery shopping this

1435
02:19:59,640 --> 02:20:05,960
week and so when i went there they're training tons of people to do the you know picking orders

1436
02:20:05,960 --> 02:20:14,120
for the pull up and drive up and delivery and um it's still over out of like everything but i'm

1437
02:20:14,120 --> 02:20:18,200
assuming that eventually it'll get better once they're not letting everybody just run rampant

1438
02:20:18,200 --> 02:20:23,560
and take everything i will say this too for people who are having a hard time getting some things

1439
02:20:25,240 --> 02:20:32,120
if you have a asian markets near you um mexican grocery stores uh indian markets

1440
02:20:32,760 --> 02:20:40,360
those are actually amazing places to get meat um you know you might have to be a little bit more

1441
02:20:40,360 --> 02:20:46,440
for either kosher or halal at some of the places um middle eastern markets for example but those

1442
02:20:46,440 --> 02:20:53,560
are great places to stock up on some things and i have seen the uh paper staples there as well so

1443
02:20:53,560 --> 02:20:58,280
you know just might not have ever been in there might look a little different than what you're

1444
02:20:58,280 --> 02:21:02,840
used to but they're good places to look for these things yeah you know how i live in kind of like

1445
02:21:02,840 --> 02:21:07,400
a very korean part of town like all the korean shops and restaurants around here apparently

1446
02:21:07,400 --> 02:21:11,640
oh yeah go to the smile market yeah apparently over at smile that's like the place you can still

1447
02:21:11,640 --> 02:21:15,320
get toilet paper so i thought that was kind of interesting at least that's what they said on next

1448
02:21:15,320 --> 02:21:19,480
door now that that came out though it's probably gone because usually when i think to go to the

1449
02:21:19,480 --> 02:21:24,520
korean market i go all the way to the gigantic they have this place called kp plaza for those

1450
02:21:24,520 --> 02:21:29,240
that you know don't live here uh which is like two supermarkets because it literally used to be like

1451
02:21:29,240 --> 02:21:34,120
a ralphson another supermarket it's two supermarkets fused together that is like nothing but international

1452
02:21:34,120 --> 02:21:39,000
stuff and that's where i usually go when i want to go to like a korean or a i'll just go to the

1453
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:45,560
huge one that's like everything the united nations of food except i was very disappointed when i

1454
02:21:45,560 --> 02:21:51,960
went there last time i could not find stroopwafel when i was there i have to go to the but that's

1455
02:21:51,960 --> 02:21:55,480
getting more and more popular at the regular store i found i found stroopwafel just a save

1456
02:21:55,480 --> 02:22:05,080
mark the other day also places like home goods ross um marshall's owns home goods on tuesday

1457
02:22:05,080 --> 02:22:14,440
morning they've actually had things like pasta um packaged non uh non-refrigerables um you know

1458
02:22:14,440 --> 02:22:18,840
like i found like some good indian food and rice and i found truffle pasta at home goods

1459
02:22:19,400 --> 02:22:26,440
um they have seasoning and spices there rob they have coffee at um your k-cups perfect um so

1460
02:22:27,400 --> 02:22:32,440
people may not think of those places but totally look at those places um you're if you've got a

1461
02:22:32,440 --> 02:22:37,960
cost plus world market near you go there they've got coffee and tea and international stuff and

1462
02:22:37,960 --> 02:22:43,640
sausages and things so think outside the box if you're running out of your staples just saying

1463
02:22:44,360 --> 02:22:49,240
all right well i think with those uh notes my final thought uh because i have to say it at

1464
02:22:49,240 --> 02:22:53,640
some point would be if you enjoyed uh orange entre do don't forget to uh help us spread the word we

1465
02:22:53,640 --> 02:22:57,720
are the show where every gamer has excuse me i have the hiccups where every gamer has the hiccups

1466
02:22:57,720 --> 02:23:03,160
where every gamer has a voice but we can't get those voices out there um if the folks don't know

1467
02:23:03,160 --> 02:23:08,520
we're here so help us spread the word uh tell a friend or or a few about the show those auto hosts

that we appreciate you and that's a great way to get the word out is through the auto hosting

1471
02:23:20,680 --> 02:23:25,080
um and yeah nice five star review on a site like itunes or wherever you found this podcast just

1472
02:23:25,080 --> 02:23:29,880
sharing the spotify link or anything like that all of that goes an awful long way i have the last

1473
02:23:29,880 --> 02:23:35,080
bit the last bit of uh breaking news here right apparently harvey weinstein has tested positive

1474
02:23:35,080 --> 02:23:43,720
for coronavirus in jail oh oh i heard that that was a little earlier so and uh ran paul

1475
02:23:43,720 --> 02:23:50,120
how is it too couldn't happen to better people i i don't know why my brain immediately went to harvey

1476
02:23:50,120 --> 02:23:56,520
firestein no god no no no and i got really concerned for a minute i was like no please but

1477
02:23:56,520 --> 02:24:01,240
then when you said harvey weinstein tried to come for tom hanks i mean harvey weinstein i was like

1478
02:24:01,240 --> 02:24:07,000
oh whatever for the record uh tom hanks posted today that he and his wife are doing a lot better

1479
02:24:07,640 --> 02:24:17,720
and has been using that uh his uh his uh platform to uh to you know encourage others and show them

1480
02:24:17,800 --> 02:24:22,520
what to do during this situation but the problem with um with wine is that it

1481
02:24:22,520 --> 02:24:28,840
indicates a wider spread at rikers so oh yeah so just keep that in mind although

1482
02:24:28,840 --> 02:24:33,560
fucking karma it's the the testing being unavailable means a lot more people have

1483
02:24:33,560 --> 02:24:36,920
this than what's being reported i mean just look at what's happening amongst the famous people

1484
02:24:36,920 --> 02:24:42,520
it's adrice elba daniel dae kim um what's her name from the old madonna movies debbie maser

1485
02:24:42,520 --> 02:24:48,440
uh you know a lot a lot of these folks have it and you know like what you know a lot we

1486
02:24:48,440 --> 02:24:52,200
we hear about them because they usually i mean a lot of them go out of their way to say i didn't

1487
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:56,840
do anything special to get a test or whatever but a lot of these guys you know can get testing a

1488
02:24:56,840 --> 02:25:02,120
little easier so i think we're hearing more about it so um yeah anyways just it's just kind of scary

1489
02:25:02,120 --> 02:25:07,400
but just that this is why we're staying home you know uh don't let's let's try to end this thing

1490
02:25:07,480 --> 02:25:12,520
by not spreading it to anybody else so all right on that note we're gonna wrap up enjoy playing
