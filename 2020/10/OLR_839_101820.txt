This week, as the next generation continues near and near, backwards compatibility, forwards
compatibility and all things preparation dominate the news.
Microsoft extends an olive branch to Xbox 360 players without their needing to pay for
it, Rock Band continues for another gaming generation, teasers of what those who buy
a new console will see when they turn it on continue to drip out and plenty more.
I don't have anything more specific to say, so let's welcome our hosts Rob Roberts,
Jamie Summers and Loki and get the show started right now where every gamer has a voice.
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again with this episode number

of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence and yeah you've talked about. Sacramento is finally doing
Project Nunway where we do a charity fashion show and then they vote on it and we win nothing
except donations um but our our theme this year was Vice and Virtue and I didn't do two outfits
because you know time I did uh Chastity and I'll put it this way my outfit is a bit of a political
statement on just how hard the concept of chastity has murdered women over history. Are you or is
people going to be able to check out check that out online somewhere or? Absolutely tickets are
still on sale um and I uh when I also I'll link the the thing through um the Sisters website and

you know taken up her position knowing that I'm on a video call now that she has to start screaming
at me. Hi Stella. Uh we weren't here last week and that was my bad because I was taking a trip
uh and uh you know it was something I needed to do so um I I missed the show last week but Loki
with there not being a show were you able to get a little extra time in to work on your game?
Um yeah I think I did work a little bit on it um so I did some coding I actually have time off
later this week to work on it more as well. I was uh working with the um person that's doing my
music and audio so they're done finally um with getting me everything that I needed for that
and then I've been going through and adjusting some of the sound effects to make things how I
like. I actually had two different people working on music and sound so I'm just taking the best
parts of both of them and tweaking my own stuff to do that. All right well I look forward to seeing
your game at some point. I hope you hurry up and finish it already. All right. I'll still get you

special guest on the show and yes we do have a guest so say hello to and I think some of the
because our guest has not been on the show before some of the audio I think is looping through a

fun fact your episode 666 I did the music for it oh okay yes that was okay okay that was you same
guy all right yes so all right so it's only you're only about uh maybe about 150 episodes after the
fact but that's all right now we get to see the guy who did uh episode number 666 no but you do
much more than that and actually um I'm I'm glad you're here tonight you know we have a lot going
on in the gaming world and we have a lot of news we can talk about we will get into that later but
you know um there's a lot going on in the world right now right with uh the pandemic covid 19
and you know the fact that we are staying a lot more at home we're not getting out in a lot of
social settings as much as we used to the fact of the matter is that is starting to take its toll
on some of our mental health right that's no secret I'm sure a lot of us are dealing with
that sort of situation well now you E you kind of are interesting because you you kind of have
some real estate in this intersection between mental health awareness and video games right
so tell us a little bit about some of your projects that you work with okay so right now
my main thing that I'm working on is I have my own podcast called am I mental uh we are a live
podcast um that goes every Thursday at six um and we go through Sprecher so we actually have a chat
room so we can actually interact with our listeners right then in there nice and we do you know and
it's a it's a weekly podcast where people talk about their issues dealing with mental health
and each week's a different story from a different person as a matter of fact
your very own Jamie here is going to be a guest on my podcast uh not this Thursday but the Thursday
after okay uh great and I and as far as gaming goes I mean I've been a gamer since the old Atari
2600 so yeah yeah and definitely um I'm in a lot of different little groups right now um the big
thing right now that we've been playing is a lot of among us um it's highly social very fun at
brain exercises and we actually I have a group chat that I put together uh I didn't put together
myself but I've been adding to it a lot but we have a group chat where it's just for among us
we don't talk politics we don't talk pandemics we just share memes and play among us and other
games and it's been really helpful you know especially I mean me myself right now I'm a
stay-at-home dad you know I've been unemployed for over a year now and my podcast has been going
since March so we're coming up on our one year anniversary you know in a few more months um
but that's all I really have going on that you know taking care of the kids making sure my
daughter gets her schoolwork done on time and all that jazz and also being in California with all
the smoke that's been in the air you know it just it really weighs down on someone well now being a
full-time parent is no short career so especially in this day and age where all the kids are going
to school virtually and stuff so I I'm sure you keep very busy between that and your different
projects as well um I think I remember you mentioning that you also had like a Facebook
group that was kind of at this intersection of mental health and video games yeah there's a group
that I got brought into by another by one of our listeners actually it's uh called Just Pause
um and it's just for gamers with mental health issues and discussing you know challenges and
helping each other brainstorm solutions like hey you know it sounds like maybe you have seasonal
affective disorder like like I do you know maybe when the sun comes out go take a walk you know and
even if you don't want to it will help you know things like that you know we're all trying to help
each other out and we're also sharing game reviews about what's coming up and all that too
um let me ask you some questions kind of diving into this topic about like
like video games and mental health well first like generally you know obviously this pandemic
was something that you know in the beginning I think some of us thought oh it'll be a couple
weeks and then they'll they'll you know figure out how to get it out of the U.S. and it'll be gone
it'll be a done deal and here we are going on month number I lost count I think we're on like
month seven of this whole thing going on and it still doesn't yeah now it's just kind of one of
those well we're just hedging our bets hoping a vaccine will be here real soon so I mean this is
continuing to go on and on and on so what are some ways let's talk like generally speaking that that
like people listening to this show what are some ways that people can like help their mental health
and make sure that they're not like spiraling I guess for lack of a better word because of
everything that's going on in the world well one of the biggest things then it's a it's a
reoccurring theme on the show like every week it pops up almost almost every week is that you know
you are not alone that even if you feel that you're going to inconvenience someone by reaching out
reach out you're not inconveniencing anyone the real problem with depression is that it gives you
a lesser self-image and it causes you to basically maximize and minimize things it maximizes
you maximize and build mountains out of other people's everything and you minimize and flatten
out everything that is you a great example is like you're in group therapy if you ever have to
go to group therapy or if you've ever gone you're going to sit around and if you're depressed you're
going to hear all these people telling their stories and you're going to think wow every
single person has it worse than me and you're going to feel like an imposter then when it's
your turn to share and you share you're going to look around and see everybody's looking at you
going wow that person has it really bad I'm an imposter so it's really important to just reach
out you know people care even if you think they don't they do as a matter of fact two episodes
ago was really really heavily about that we actually had someone who did a ted talk who
they had a student commit suicide when they were their first year teaching
two years later they had another one attempt suicide she found out about it wrote a letter
to that student that student started crying going i didn't know anybody cared so she she sat down
for two months and wrote 130 handwritten letters took a picture of it put it up on facebook sharing
this is what i'm doing she didn't think it was anything special it's just this is what i have to
do two days later she's getting calls from bbc she's getting calls from good morning america
washington post new york times usa today everybody wants her on the show or wants an interview for
their news articles wow and it all boils down to the same thing you always feel like you're
less than you actually are just reach out it's interesting you kind of bring up that feeling
of being an imposter because lord knows i have felt that imposter syndrome right it's kind of
like another way of framing it i have felt that i can't tell you how many times doing some of these
things i've been able to do because of the success i guess of this podcast things like being a guest
on dragon con panels and getting to sometimes moderate these celebrity panels i have absolutely
had those moments of oh my god at some point these folks are gonna find out i am not ninja i am not
you know one of these youtubers that have like a million views they're gonna be like what the hell
is this guy doing on stage get him off of there like that that imposter syndrome stuff that can
really mess with your head it really can oh absolutely and i bet you when you were done
people came up to compliment you afterwards on this job you did yes yeah not i i try to be humble
but yes and that that kind of helped with um you know some of those other things that i was feeling
is i was like oh thank gosh for that validation maybe i'll be able to sneak through and do this
again another year right and that's another thing that we it's really big and with our even our chat
group our tech group absolutely amazing some of the most fanatically loyal fans i've ever seen
and i mean i've done professional performances where i was performing 400 crowds of 10 000 people
and i've never seen this um where it comes down to it doesn't matter what your story is your story
is yours your struggle is yours it is valid just because you feel someone else has it worse than
you doesn't mean that others aren't going to look and think that you have it worse than them and
even that doesn't matter it's your struggle um and the validation it helps a lot to get through that
yeah absolutely absolutely and i think uh knowing that like your concerns in your situation is valid
is is huge no matter what the scope or size of it is like you know like you you mentioned before
when it comes to this pandemic situation everything we are all going through this
thing together you know so there's there's a lot of feelings that we're all feeling
right and as politicized as it has become let's face it a virus is not a politician a virus is a
virus right and it's hitting all of us right some harder than others but still in the end
we're all going through it absolutely jamie you were trying to add something yeah i was i was
saying that um earlier in the year when i was still sick with pneumonia and playing a lot of
animal crossing um after after the fact because i mean my my dad died um my mother-in-law died um
you know a lot of people were grieving and couldn't go more than their family members we
were talking about how people are using video games as their coping mechanism i have an entire
cemetery in my cute little animal crossing village and each grave there represents somebody or
something close to me and and my friend built like a memorial garden to her mother who died a year ago
in animal crossing and you know there were funerals in final fantasy 14 you know they
had that whole procession walk um you know and i think that i i think well and also the creators
in wow are really good about putting up memorials to very notable people that have been lost you
know and so i think that there's a major juxtaposition with those of us who work or
work or live in gaming culture with our different ways of dealing with our own mental health
that aren't necessarily something that your average psychologist say would look into although
there are some studies about it i'm seeing more studies on it and especially for me being um
neurodivergent you know my way of coping with something is going to be completely different
than how someone else copes with it you know i feel like an imposter every day because
i have to mask my different neurobiology from all humans of the earth there is a site that
summed up what being autistic is like for me it's called anotherplanet.org
because i feel like i'm from another planet sometimes and all of all of these human people are
are weird now i have a place to go to learn more i have to see if it's still running it's been a
while all right but um but yeah but all of the you know all of these aspects of how we deal with
everything the hobbies that we do the things that we enjoy all of that wraps into our personal
coping mechanisms but yeah yeah definitely um now e you can appreciate this since you were talking
about the among us memes earlier because of course we do tape live every sunday night on twitch so oh
we do have our chat room going at twitch.tv slash vog network and i am going to be a little bit
piggy choosy in the comments i read tonight because some people are being very transparent
with their mental health and i don't want to necessarily read people that are like i'm dealing
with this i'm dealing with that because i don't know if you really want that on the podcast um so
i am going to kind of refrain a little bit from reading every comment um but i think you can
appreciate these comments e um some people saying uh act deaf says i'm not an imposter you're all
sus to me dg says i think act deaf is acting hella sus bobby black hole says why did you just come
climb out of the vent love it i absolutely love it um yeah and act deaf reminded me that that's a
a tumblr account so it probably still is up nice yeah um yeah i'm not that's chatted off um when i
when i'm running my podcast i have the co-host doing most of the reading of the chat room and
moderating but i'll still read it because i mean we don't have a ton of people in there it's easy
enough to keep up with but it's i have to pay more attention to the guest and try to pay less
attention to the chat yeah we we've gotten crazy multitasking skills over the 18 years doing this
show so that has been an integral part of the show since we started if i take a weird angle it's
probably because i'm looking over at the chat room because i'm i'm situated weird for the four shot
tonight that's all right and i'm usually doing the in-person typing chat so yeah nice yeah it's
like when we do our show um we do video between each other but only for each other it's only audio
otherwise um and like the guests and the co-host will see me all of a sudden just like get this
grin and thank goodness for my 26 years of uh phone support and it experienced where i don't
just burst out laughing i've come close with some of the comments in chat like someone's talking
about you know i lost my mom i've had this big drinking problem and then something funny pops
up in chat i'm like trying so hard not to laugh i bet i bet because that's part of it is the live
aspect of it so it's been kind of fun oh yeah i love the live aspect of it getting back to the
mental health and using video games to kind of deal with that you know um dark sakura brought
up uh that she had the memorials um that she had in her animal crossing game and uh interestingly
enough that is also something i ended up doing you know i lost my mom in 2017 and that you know
that's not something you really ever get over and when there was the mom character in animal
crossing that started sending all the gifts i kind of felt like i needed a place to put those gifts
so i set up a memorial kind of as well so i'm kind of like animal crossing is a very interesting
sort of game and i'm not sure how well versed you are in animal crossing but you know it's it's
interesting because of the fact that it came out right when this pandemic happened that you have
so many people that have been using this game to kind of deal with what's going on i i i don't know
e i saw kind of shaking your head maybe it's not a game you're really playing but have you heard
much about how people are using this to cope or oh yeah i've heard a lot about how people are using
it to cope um i don't have a switch i i just have my phone and i have a mac so i sure and the mobile
version of animal crossing no not the same no i gave up on that yeah it's like it's not that i
don't want to i just don't have the means right now to to play it um but i've seen the uh of
course i watched some video play of it and all that it looks like a great game but yeah uh the
ability to go ahead and do that a little bit of free world crafting and being able to do those
memorials i've seen a lot of people talking about how for them that's what helped them with the
whole grieving process and um grieving comes up a lot on our show and do you mind if i plug a book
it's not mine no go ahead but it's a great one it's called the grief recovery handbook
that one has helped me we talk a lot of we talk about we plug a lot of video games that aren't
ours so a book is okay too no fair enough but yeah the grief recovery handbook it changed my life
it helped me find methods and avenues of grieving that were much more healthy
than just sitting and dwelling and hoping it goes away it doesn't you you have to do something
and that's where like the angle crossing stuff really helps if i may also throw this in there's
a good ted talk and i think it's by brené brown about uh um closure and how it's truly not a
healthy concept that there's never closure you can never separate yourself from your grief or
your death because you also separate yourself from the good memories that come with it as well
you know there's there's no moving on there's an american culture in general has separated itself
from death and grieving that you know we used to host you know the bodies in our homes
families would wash them prior to you know that we've separated ourselves so much from that
process that i think that that's part of why we have trouble grieving anyway but and so
for us to be able to bring that aspect back into our lives even in a virtual environment you know
in animal crossing we have a grave in the town that is supposed to be our virtual home you know
and it's there and you can visit it and you can see it it's not removed out in another town that
you have to drive to go oh i gotta go to the you know cemetery me i used to have picnics in
cemeteries when i lived in alabama um i used to go i used to take my cousins out snipe hunting
but but anyway it's i feel like our video games like this and this like this new grieving
process that's sort of reincorporating something that we've lost as a culture
back into our our daily lives we may not have a corpse in our house i mean
but we have like that memento mori exactly our own reminder of our own mortality as we remember
those who have left us and it's it's it's interesting you do to kind of talk about
like the grieving process and how video games might be kind of one way to deal with that
and i don't think necessarily grieving has to necessarily be just about over the loss of life
you know everything has really changed because of this pandemic some people are grieving
the loss of a job that people are grieving you know the loss of a routine the loss of maybe you
used to go to a rave every saturday night and say what you will about raves but you know that that's
church for some people it is a huge social thing and people are very likely grieving the loss of
that as well so i i've kind of always said since the beginning of this i said this whole situation
is crap this covid thing is crap the pandemic is crap but the art that's going to come from
the after this year is going to be amazing and i think video you know and if we subscribe to the
thought process that video games are art which i do um that's just one big part of it but the
grieving for some people can be making a podcast making a twitch stream or a youtube which i've
always been a big proponent proponent about trying to get people to do that but i started a new
project which i'll plug later yeah and you know and there's all sorts of those types of projects
but it could also be like i'm taking up a cross stitch thing i've always wanted to do and i never
got around to doing or making masks can be a thing for people too like we were you know doing that
round table a couple weeks ago with the cosplayers talking about that how you know there's no
conventions right now but you can still kind of get your arts and crafts in from doing masks
so i was doing project one way for me was it was kind of like bringing my cosplay back
right right um and bobby is saying i used to go to a bar trivia every other thursday night with
my friends since i worked from home before all this that would sometimes be literally the only
time i left the house right so say what you will about zoom trivia and the the replacements which
is great it's nice that we have those things but you know it's not the same it's really not yeah
yeah and it's just you don't get that someone accidentally bump into you sorry sorry or you
know meet some random person and strike up a conversation and wind up with a good friend you
just just doesn't happen as often when it's virtual i mean i'm not saying it doesn't happen
it just doesn't happen as often well and with me being one of the sisters our entire aspects of
ministry have changed i think i was a much better adapted to online ministry than some of the older
sisters i am the youngest one in our group you know we have some you know we used to have a
retiree in that was our abbess um and so um for a group that's so social that would go out to do
bar ministry and have in-person events i've had to sort of be the reminding factor y'all need to
wear your masks when we're out in public i i had to distance myself i'm like you can do all of
this online our meetings are online everything is and i think that that though i'm hoping that
that's bringing older generations into a more modern concept so that maybe these techniques
that we are developing those of us who are gen x and younger are able to teach them these same
concepts teach them that there is a new way to express what they're feeling or to live to be
social that you don't have to sit at a table across from someone drinking with them to still
enjoy someone's company exactly and for a lot of people who are just really big extroverts
i think this is a powerful lesson in people learning how to be alone
yeah yeah that's learn how to enjoy your own company i'm a big extrovert you know it's no
secret i was hosting shows hosting you know this right now i i i should have hosted a rocky horror
last night you know like that with 500 people over at the colonial it was great when it all began
yeah but uh that's cute uh but you know that's not happening and so it's it's it's it's been hard
i'm not gonna lie you know like yeah i am that extrovert that a lot of the introverts are talking
about and it's it's it's been tricky in its own way so yeah um let me ask this not not to be in
a negative place but i would be remiss not to ask are there ways that video games in this whole
situation could be bad for your mental health what are some things as gamers we should avoid
absolutely sometimes the escapism or whatever if that's what you want to call it i'm not
sure what the exact term is but you can definitely overdo it to the point where you're neglecting
your physical health you're neglecting your hygiene you're neglecting your diet
if you have family you're neglecting your family you're neglecting your pets
absolutely trash your sleep cycle sleep hygiene is very important for mental function
you know getting the right amount of sleep during the right times for whatever your sleep cycle
happens to be uh is really critical um i've been known to go ahead and just binge on a game when
i'm unsupervised even now i'm 43 years old the wife takes the kids out i will get on and i'll
play a game start at in the morning and go until sunrise the next day you know and it it trashes my
mental health you know i feel like i'm having a good time i feel like i'm having fun but it's a
short-term game long-term loss for me you know because i i could have gone outside taking a walk
which would have been much more beneficial you know for me i have to really moderate how much
i play and what i play because there are some games that i have associated with very bad periods
of my life that i just need to avoid as good as the games are i just i can't play them for my own
mental health i hope that answers no for sure for sure and you know i've seen my mass effect binges
i i've you know i i think because i i i'm very lucky in that i really enjoy my job and i like
what i do and i do have the ability throughout all this to be able to work from home and i recognize
i'm very lucky in all those aspects so but i think that helps keep my sleep schedule on track because
if i didn't have my job to worry about i think i would probably very easily fall into this pattern
of you know i can stay up till 3 a.m doing mining and crafting and final fantasy because nobody's
going to bother me it'd be very easy to fall into that even before the pandemic we would hear those
stories about oh the guy at the cyber cafe in korea that spent 24 hours straight playing league
of legends that just collapsed you know or um you know the the person that played wow all weekend
long and ended up you know having a severe medical issue because this is how these are the
types of things that can lead to issues like strokes and things that if you don't get up and
move around that's very serious you have to that's one reason you know i like my watch not to give
these guys a free ad and to do to be fair all the please give them a free ad all the modern to be
fair all the modern fitness watches do it so i'm gonna leave it at that but they they will poke you
every hour and go hey hey fatty get up get up get up off your ass and so when people go why
did you spend all that money on a watch i kind of go you know what like even though it like sounds
small those things are a huge deal later on and you know and for our listeners out there because
i'm sure we have several listeners that are like i i don't have a fancy fitness watch and that's
not happening for me that's so you don't need one you can set a timer on your computer or a timer on
your casio old school calculator watch that goes off every 59 minutes that does the same type of
thing you know that reminds you to get up and move around you can get these little cheapo things on
wish for three bucks now and they do the same thing exactly so there's there's plenty of other
solutions besides the fancy fruit stuff and you know all that so and you just always say to your
phone hey phone set timer four yes yes so yeah very very important stuff um so um yeah and i'm
looking in chat and again i want to be careful what i read tonight because i think people are
saying some very vulnerable things i don't necessarily want to put that out there um but
i see some people talking about their sleep schedules are not in a great place right now
uh one listener is talking about going to bed at 1am and then waking up at 8am now it's 10pm and
waking up at 4am which seems seems to be a little more you know but yeah i mean that that sleep
schedule is is crazy the other thing with my work and i think this is very important is that
i have found and i need to be better about this i need to do because this was this was something
when i thought it was just going to be a two-week solution my workplace and my pc gaming place are
the exact same place and i think that's that's very bad it is no it's very bad and that's why
like and you know it's interesting because i've also been asked why why why are you buying new
consoles when you have a pc and in my opinion this is just exacerbating like this is why i
need to have a different space to play games sometimes that isn't in front of the bc which is
what i'm doing all day for work you know and even when it is going back to the office sometimes
instead of sitting in my ergonomically sound chair i want to be a potato on the couch and
play some no man's sky and just changing up those types of factors is really healthy because again
i'm admitting and you're all agreeing what i'm doing right now is bad like pc gaming and working
in the same place is bad but unfortunately it's kind of my only choice right now until we do some
major rearranging i have two separate computers though side by side i've got my my uh my work max
and then i have my pc which is gonna be going away soon but i have another mac over there
that's my other workstation for doing my own creative work one thing i did when i was in
that situation where i had my gaming pc and my work pc side by side is i made sure my gaming pc
was off while i was working and i had a specific work chair when i was done with work i turned off
the work computer switched chairs something whether it's a physical change of location
or some psychological change really helps to help keep it separated um because one of the dangers of
working from home is to fall into the routine of oh well i have five minutes i could go move the
laundry you really shouldn't you really should try to keep guilty effort for your life i know
so am i but you should really try to keep those aspects separated for your own health now see for
me i need those moments because of um my chronic fatigue if i am doing nothing but focusing on my
work computer and i work a 10-hour day with an hour lunch so i can get three days off in a row
um but anyway for me i need those moments i actually have a medical reason that i get three
extra breaks in my shift and i get up and leave i used to have a bad habit of staying at my desk
and doing like my email or stuff during my lunch i need those separate moments where i am not in
work mode i am real life mode and for me being home to do that instead of going like say to the
cafe to get you know a snack or a coffee or something i'm still in the building and still
seeing for lack of a better description the work propaganda yeah whereas if i leave this room i get
me out by my cat and she's a lot nicer yeah and what i'm saying though is it's more the general
rule not the hard yeah everybody right um i mean when i have my switch next to me everybody's
going to be different everybody's going to be different yeah yeah like for me because i mean
i used to work the same company that jamie did um and she remembers i was a wanderer on my breaks
at lunchtime yes i went around and i made i visited as many people as i could it's just part
of who i am um and i was always trying to help people out give little tips of advice to try to
pick up some of my own but you don't do what frank does he puts on that wireless headset
and walks down the aisle while he's doing his thing yeah um and by the way rob drew works with
us too no i know i know yeah so but when i got to move from home or got to move to home i actually
have a detached office which right now my son's living in but he's moving out on this coming up
friday and i get to have that back as my sound studio hardwired internet to it um what i would
do is between calls is i have my door open and i play fetch with my dog i like that i like that
idea too of just changing something like your chair like if it isn't it possible for you to
change the entire environment just change you know your chair change maybe something that is
surrounding maybe you have a a digital picture frame and the pictures show different when you're
working versus when you're not i mean it sounds silly but or maybe the curtain is closed when
you're working but then it's open when you're not you know just like those little changes to your
environment can be huge even like a little dummy light switch that you drill into your desk well
and i'm sure you guys can see that i have this like roller cart behind me loaded with toys
yeah it is actually a barrier between now i have it at an angle i can still kind of see across
but it's still technically my barrier for where my work situation is so and i have completely
different toys facing the other direction so i kind of like can build my own cubicle wall for
and this whole room is going to get redone so i'm actually going to be picking myself up a uh
a green screen and a blue screen so that i can have that as an actual for real physical divider
neat okay yeah um and if you guys in chat have any questions for um e please go ahead and uh
let them uh out in our chat room over twitch.tv slash avog network uh and again e is the host of
the podcast am i mental that is a very hard name to forget yes i'm kidding well i i bet for a lot
of people it might be i mean again we're not a doctor and if you think you you maybe you
probably should always get assessed by a doctor but we're one gestalt doctor i bet i bet the
answer to am i mental is uh maybe a little bit but probably not as bad as you think
for a lot of people i i like to quote the mad hatter here we're all mad here i'm mad you're mad
my whole thing was is that when you start to wrestle with the fact that you might have uh
some kind of mental illness or mental health issue uh a question usually does pop up along the lines
of am i crazy is it me is there something wrong with me am i mental and i figured that was kind
of a catchy name and it stuck and it really has a lot of meaning because i those questions um and
we actually do have an official website am i mental dot net dot com was taken by somebody
else i had to take net but um yeah and um no we're actually at the process right now we're going
through our third season uh we only do two episodes ten episode seasons we're trying to
match the seasons of the year so each season is a different actual season like we're in the fall
season right now then the next one will be the winter season um but we're already booking up
for season four already and we are only three episodes in on season three so it feels really
good like um just gotta give you an idea of how it's growing my first season unfortunately i
started on march 19th first day of spring which it just happened to land that way i didn't even
know was the first day of spring it's like three days before the episode and then went yeah let's
just follow the seasons that's kind of how it came through but it took me two months to get it all
booked out and then covet hit and essential workers wound up working you know like six
12-hour shifts and i had the entire season it was just rescheduling rescheduling rescheduling
season two took a month to get scheduled season three it was done in under 12 hours
what do you get in your system plans to to take the time off to be on for was it the 29th
yeah yes you have the basically the halloween episode and no one is surprised yeah and i was
like i laughed about it too because like i did the music for your 666 episode and you're coming
over for my first halloween episode yeah kismet perfect well you know what with you having done
our music for that episode funny thing is that i made our podcast theme for this one
oh for our new podcast name i did it myself very cool yeah with a little help yeah i mean
that part of where you work it starts coming naturally after a little while you just kind
of poking around and playing with things well and you know who it is jamal helped me
oh yeah jamal's awesome yeah let me let me get y'all talking about people that our listeners
don't know so let me get back to this question in chat no no it's fine it's fine um some good
you know tips and and lessons learned from some of our chatters here uh shmaketastic in chat over
twitch.tv slash vlog network says i've made the mistake of having my work desk next to my gaming
desk and using the same chair i feel as if i'm associating the work stress with gaming
and stressfully gaming sometimes like being unable to let gaming relax me sometimes and that's that's
big that's really talking about like you know the the the being able to have like the separate
spaces you can separate those things in your mind mentally yeah um one of the coolest little stories
i ever heard this was back i was in seventh grade my english teacher was talking about how this guy
every day after work he'd get home and he would touch one specific branch on the tree as he came
to onto his property and went into the house and then every day on his way to work he touched that
same branch and leave and he did this for over a year his wife finally asked what are you doing
and he says when i get home from work i'm hanging up all of my work stresses on that tree
and then when i leave to go back to work i'm picking them up again and noticing they're a
lot lighter than they were when i put them there i like that it's a good story i thought that was
a cool little story i like that um ssj100 mat and chat says i've been making sure to go outside
mostly late at night or early morning when there's fewer folks to get my outside time because that is
also important being in a two-room studio for now feels claustrophobic thankfully i'm moving in a
week you know that importance of getting outside and moving around is so important and luckily
you know a lot of that is gamified uh you know obviously pokemon go is the huge behemoth that
a lot of people talking about for motivation to go outside but there's other games as well you know
loki has talked a lot about orna the you know kind of rpg inspired one that is when you can uh play
out while you walk as well minecraft earth uh there's a jurassic world one the list goes on
and on chances are one of those games is something that could incentivize you going outdoors if you
need it absolutely and i mean um what's kind of funny is that i'm seeing a lot of especially now
with the mobile gaming community the way that it is a little bit of a tangent here is that the
aims range is spectacular on the people that you interact with but nobody's judging on age at all
you know because we're all just trying to get away trying to have a little bit of fun
yeah um as it should be yeah and it's like i'm 43 years old and i run a guild and a game called
shop titans uh basically it's like you're the instead of being the you know you go to the shop
in a role-playing game to sell all your junk and buy new stuff you're the shopkeeper and the
players the npcs are the adventurers i play there's like a shop girl game yeah i played a game like
that on steam but it wasn't like an mo it was like a racketeer something was the name of that
game i somebody in chattel here right is that it somebody in chattel no yeah there was a game like
that i was playing on steam yeah at this one um one of our most active members is a retiree
you know and um in my group on among us they keep calling me og because i've been playing
since the atara 2600 you know and some of these people are like i never even heard of that system
before they had to look it up oh wow oh wow yeah yeah doesn't that make you feel old yeah a little
bit that's interesting because among us and you you keep coming back to that game and obviously
that is the a huge uh a game right now it's it's in the top all the time on twitch and so forth
but i also think that game that game is some i don't know if i want to say mental warfare
but it can be some serious like mental gymnastics because you essentially are having to lie to
people sometimes and that's really uncomfortable so how does that work with the mental health
a lot of people in my group when they're the imposter they just help themselves right away
because they can't do it they don't want to do it but they really enjoy the mind play of trying to
figure out who the imposter is i like being the imposter i love being the imposter um i my
favorite is when there's two imposters if i'm the first one to die the other imposter never has to
worry about sabotage again so they can keep moving constantly and no one goes i saw them
stop just before this yeah nope they didn't stop because i'm helping them but yeah no it takes
some teamwork makes the dream work yep but it does it takes a mentality to be able to be the
the imposter and be able to fly but i mean for me i'm not lying to them for the because i'm trying
to get away with actual murder or actual crimes sure it's just all fun and games it's role playing
for me and i play dungeons and dragons and i played star wars i play a lot of role-playing
games so it's just role play for me sure it's like the old werewolf game we used to play on
ddr forums yeah and uh and uh the werewolf is a the game that is infamous at dragon con you know
and those those types of things so yeah it's to me among us is just an evolution of that mafia slash
who's the werewolf type of game it's it's just somebody thought how to put that in a digital
format in a platforming type of way and they did an amazing job with it and it's interesting
because it it sat for two years before it got discovered which really makes that game really
fascinating and how it works so yeah i mean it's just like that whole town of salem whatever
except that instead of it being you have your discussion cycle okay now it's the night cycle
do your thing you're actually running around physically doing things on the game and if you're
the imposter you're trying to fake doing these things without getting caught faking you're
trying to find opportunities that you can off someone and you're trying to set up sabotages
and clever ways to help get people separated from the herd you know and it's and there's also a lot
of the mental play too where as the imposter you don't want the finger pointed at you obviously
and you want to try to make sure that you get the finger pointed elsewhere if someone starts to
suspect you well and you know you know what's also interesting and i think that works with among us
is that it also works i think because the games are so short and you can play like 15 games of
it a night because i'll tell you uh i i am into those types of psychological games like survivor
on tv and um uh like big brother and stuff like that well before it got super racist but the game
itself i find very fascinating um but survivor i've played versions of survivor online that are
very intense they go on for a month and you're sitting at home but you're still on skype a lot
of the time or discord or whatever it is with you know your tribe mates and the people you're
working with like to the point where you know i i won i was i was lucky enough to win one last
summer but like i remember i had to vote out my closest ally at final four because if he didn't
get voted out he was going to win and if i want to win he's got to go but i cried i because i was
just so invested and like you know i definitely learned like oh my gosh to play a game like this
i have got to have the mental energy to do it and i don't i haven't played one since i've been
asked to play like four or five different games and i i just i also kind of recognize like i need
a mental reserve battery i don't have right now and i thought the pandemic was going to give me
the time but i don't think it's given me that mental reserve battery by any means and that's
why i've passed up so many opportunities to play during what i think is a really great time to play
right yeah it's like i mean um even with my podcast like i have a daughter she's an adult now
uh going to uh she's going to a jc at this moment um she wanted to do psychology major she's changed
it now but even she has said because of the pandemic she can't listen to most of the episodes
of my podcast because she just doesn't have that reserve you know the pandemic is draining it you
know because she used to go out on every saturday it was go out to a restaurant have something to
eat with your group of friends and then go play board games that's just gone yeah you know for
real and that recharged her batteries to allow her to be able to enjoy you know my podcast she's only
listened to a couple episodes and you know she feels so bad about it you know she's like i'm so
sorry i'm so sorry i'm like honey it's fine i get it this is not a podcast for everybody in all
situations some of my closest friends will hear the topic of an episode and they're like i'm gone
can't deal with this one no yeah yeah and that's yeah i get that and i haven't hit an episode yet
as a host where i'm going no but if it happens it happens and i'm gonna either have to power through
it i'm gonna have to ask the co-host hey this one's too personal can you take it yeah you know
and i get it yeah and i don't require my friends to listen to this show i really it's it's a lie
and it's not video games like the the deep discussion we do on some of this stuff is not
for everybody but it is for some people so for those of you that that are here i i appreciate
you always being here whether it's live on sunday nights or whenever you can fit us in during the
week on the podcast feed it's awesome um e i have to start to wrap up here because we're almost an
hour in and i got to make sure we get to all the gaming news tonight uh it's been fabulous to have
you on though but i want to ask before we um wrap up and let you go i want to ask you know one big
question we do at the top of the show is how was your gaming week you've mentioned some of the
games that you've been playing between your um your your item shop rpg and uh among us what are
what what does the gaming week look like for you what are some games that you uh entertain yourself
with in these times so i'm big on uh sports games like i love uh nba 2k i i don't really
like madden football so much i'm waiting for the 2k football because now the licensing is open
again hold up hold up hold up chat note the date and time sports finally made its way to olr
everyone sports in a mental health segment no less sports finally made its way to olr no i
think it's great please continue no i was um i was very athletic as a kid i played baseball i played
soccer pickup games of football basketball you name it i i played it um so i do a lot of those
kinds of games um and recently i'm i know i'm a little late to the game pun intended kind of um
but i've been playing a lot of dead before daylight i absolutely love that game
terrifies me and i love it okay you need to uh play with my husband because that is his game
that he is obsessed with right now he's always playing dead by daylight always yeah unfortunately
my phone can't quite handle it so i had to get it for my ps4 nope and i'm just waiting for the
new gran turismo that's going to be my excuse for the ps5 i love gran turismo all right perfect
perfect um well e before we let you go please uh plug away everything that you uh wanted to plug
here your your podcast your facebook group uh because this is such a huge topic that you know
one hour on the top of the show is not enough to talk about it but if people want to continue the
conversation of mental health you know we'll do our best here on olr to make this you know a safe
space to share those types of struggles and stories but if we want to continue those
conversations in another dedicated space with other people that really kind of study this stuff
please e what are some of the other places we can follow you yeah so um the main web page is
just mi mental dot net um or we broadcast every thursday 6 p.m live if you want to be a part of
the chat you do have to go to sprecker.com sign up for a free account they don't spam they don't
sell your information that's why i chose them um we also have a facebook group uh just it's
facebook.com slash a mental live cast and then there's also the um just pause group which is
specifically for gamers that are dealing with mental health issues um yeah i did repost the
website in the chat room all right and of course uh jamie will be on the episode for us on the 29th
so come check it out this is the way that we do it is when i introduce you i will say you know
tell us a little bit about yourself what we're going to talk about at that point it's your
platform i'm just the uh a host and um basically i'm facilitating is all i'm really doing i love
that name by the way just pause i think that's a perfect way to kind of incorporate gaming and
a good like mental health lesson too it is and whoever came up with that absolutely brilliant
i love that they did that um y'all thought i was a ranty bitch here wait um all right so we're
gonna move on the show e thank you so much for being here tonight i really appreciate it um
great discussion and i think there are going to be some folks that want to continue this discussion
with you later on and at some point let's have you back especially you know hopefully in the
new year maybe we'll be talking about the other side of this pandemic and we can kind of check in
again on some post-pandemic ways to check in and and make sure our health mental health is still
in a good place that would be great and in the meantime i'm trying to get our forums up so that
way we can have our episodes go beyond just being an episode it can be a discussion that goes on for
days weeks months however long it needs perfect so that's up and coming on the website look into
discord too because it's been very good for us yeah we really enjoyed discord yeah all right
take care e thanks for being here tonight yeah drum in the castle all right we'll see you later
will that pill actually work i don't know if it does take it if there's a year taken off my life
i hope it's 2020 no kidding i love that meme yeah later all right take care all right we're gonna
get to another segment called how was your gaming week so let's get into it and talk a little bit
about our gaming weeks so dark sakura we'll start with you how was your gaming week it was animal
crossing um i had i would be shocked if it wasn't i have hades i haven't had a chance to play it yet
um i did play a little bit more ppl um i it's just with project nun way i haven't really had
a super lot of time but we did get a new pinball um we now have the uh jersey jack pirates of the
caribbean we have sold off quite a few pinball to be able to uh afford it um we have sold indiana
jones um we have sold uh no we didn't sell shadow we sold um star trek the next generation we had
the old valley star trek that we sold a few others um so uh it's it's pretty crazy it's one of those
ones that's got the big screen with the full video on it rob one of this that's what the jersey jack
ones are like like uh the wizard of oz so um so yeah it's it's pretty crazy i haven't really
i played it in the past at other people's houses so this is uh a little bit you know of a thing
um and i have other gaming ish things going on but i won't talk about that yet i'll wait until
gaming week is over if you don't mind okay sure you got it yeah uh doctor who
accord uh climb pod culture loki you're still here it's so quiet i am hope you're all right
no you're fine you're fine i know sometimes you want to let the guests talk it's fine
exactly and all i can really contribute to that is yeah i'm angry all the time because i have to do
i have to work and with people that they're people um so anyways um so this week i didn't play a
whole ton of things but i did play some new stuff so i tried out the new mario kart uh home circuit
live so i got to play that a little bit so that was cool how was that i was watching bobby play
it on stream it looked it looked neat yeah it's pretty neat um so not a lot of like space i was
hoping that it would be able to work through multiple rooms but as you probably saw in his
stream it does not handle that very well you can only go like not too far away especially if you
have a wall in between you yeah you have to line a site the switch basically which if you're willing
to play in handheld mode he brought this up on the call the bobby when we were talking at the end of
his show if you're willing to take the switch off the dock and walk behind the car you can make a
bigger course but that would involve you getting up and moving yeah um yeah so we didn't do that
but um i was able to set it up in a few rooms in the house so we tried it out there and it's
pretty cool um i like that you can go online and print replacements for some of the stuff so i
printed out more of those barriers um so now they're all like shiny and stuff so that's kind
of fun how crazy is it by the way that when microsoft was kind of the first to put their
paw into ar gaming with the hololens and obviously we never really saw anything fully realized with
that i mean we had the there there was a a sleuthing game that was pretty good on there
but i mean obviously it never got to the level where they put out a consumer device for that
and they were talking about like a minecraft ar game but we never did get that although i kind
of think micro minecraft earth is probably bits of what we would have seen in a minecraft
hololens game but um isn't it interesting that microsoft was kind of doing that and then nintendo
just out of nowhere who we usually tease for being behind in technology when it comes to
online gaming or their vr is really you know kind of half-assed with labo compared to competitors
or they're you know just they're never the power of the of the other systems on the market
the that nintendo comes in and really puts out like hey here's our idea for an ar game and it's
really good like i don't know if it has longevity that's my concern with it but i mean just as a
cool shit for my kids to play with that'll entertain them for a while i think it's a big
win for nintendo well i'll tell you what's better than uh where it exceeds with what they did with
labo is um you can fold that all the uh checkpoints down back into a box when you're done
playing with them fair enough so that that already is like you know loads ahead of everything else
that they've done um other than that yeah it's it's fun for a while i think um i'm sure that
they'll release more stuff for it like updates and everything they could just easily put out like new
things for the scanning that does different stuff i mean and that wouldn't be that hard for them to
do um kind of disappointing that you can only do one player per system which is annoying um i get
it but like flip screen should probably be able to be a thing um so that's kind of a little
disappointing because my kids want to like kind of play together but like we don't have two systems
well i mean think of it think of it as you're paying a hundred dollars for the car you're not
paying a hundred dollars because the game is free the game you can go on shop right now and
download the game it's just not going to do shit without the car but you're really paying for the
car not the game so if you kind of frame it that way i think maybe the two-player thing might sit
a little better i don't know yeah that's the other thing too is like i pre-ordered that like a while
ago and um come release day walmart didn't ship it so i just went down to the store and they had
them there i'm like and they were ten dollars cheaper so i was like um this doesn't make any
sense but okay we'll do it this way kind of has me concerned because that's where my xbox series x
is too so we'll see um hopefully they're a little bit better about that but um so aside from the
mario kart live stuff i did play a bit of orna um i did try out pac-man uh was it pac-man geo
it's not good oh that's the one where they just made the google earth pac-man thing a game right
yeah it's it is basically that i mean they didn't there's no frills to it at all but
it's just like you can like pick different parts of the map to actually make
a level out of but you have to zoom way in to get to the streets and like i'm in a pretty small
neighborhood myself i couldn't get it to work in my neighborhood because it couldn't create a level
out of that there wasn't enough like small even smaller streets which is weird and then even when
and then even when you do have that because i was able to get it like over in fair oaks
where it's like twisty it doesn't make any sense over there i was able to get it to play on that
but the controls are awful it's all touch controls to like moving you have to swipe in the direction
that you want to go and when you have streets that are kind of they're not perpendicular to
each other and they're kind of all over the place because i mean not all streets are perpendicular
it doesn't control well at all and it just wasn't fun i played it for about five minutes
i tried a few different areas i tried one because they start you off in like a tutorial on um
oh in new york so you play there with with the statue of liberty um so i played that and then
i tried someplace closer to my house and it just was super boring and it was already starting like
hey you can buy stuff i'm like okay bye no thanks so um being that there's no it's not like an
augmented reality game where you can walk places and you know collect things and stuff like that
like pokemon go ingress orna you know all the other ones out there um it's just kind of
pointless it's basically the google little thing that they did for april fool's day and then just
worse so you can try it out it's free but like i mean i i installed that pretty quick oh and
by the way um so you have to create an account uh you can link it to social media so facebook or
twitter um to track your progress that's broken right now so you have to just not link it to
anything and so i think deleting my game on there actually lost all my pro what little progress i
had oh no um so it's just not pretty good okay um and then aside from that just been working on
game stuff and yeah pretty much it all right uh my gaming week you know we had a long intro tonight
so i can i can keep this short because i haven't really played a lot of new stuff still still
trucking along on final fantasy 14 i got my first crafter to 80 today so i think by this time next
week they'll all be to 80 my my carpenter is 80 now so i've been working on that but i did get
all my gatherers to 80 and fall nancy 14 so that's what kind of what i'm looking at and then they put
out the uh the bojjan front in this they did a mini patch this week and they did the bojjan front
um which is which is interesting uh it's they're talking a lot online about the red chocobo fight
because there is there is a a group fight that you end up doing that is a it's red comet is the
name of the chocobo and it is a red chocobo i gasped when i did the fight because i was not
prepared it does these aoes right when it draws on the ground this is the attack that it's going
to do it was nuts i had not seen anything like it in the game and i was like where the f am i
supposed to go stand that's safe i can't in this like one tiny little space that you really have
to hunt for so that that red chocobo fight was was nuts so i've been checking that out too
and then still playing hades i finally made my way to the third boss flare uh i don't want to give a
spoiler there's something different with the third boss so i i got there uh but i wasn't able to beat
it yet so i'm gonna keep working on it uh and that's it i haven't really played a lot of new
stuff the one kind of new thing i played i'm gonna have a bobby blackwolf moment here and you're
gonna understand why i said that in a minute because the only new thing i played was a demo
and i've completely judged this game based off the demo and i know like much like bobby
blackwolf and nino cooney this game can kiss my ass based off the demo guess what game that is
because this is going to surprise you is really going to surprise you kingdom hearts melody of
memories or is it memory of melodies i don't know mom kingdom hearts mom surprised it sucks
interesting it sucks i'm sorry and there's going to be people that are into it and like it and
they're going to be like rob what's your problem you're such an asshole but i just i'm sorry it
was not like i i was really irritated that they took a formula that really worked the theater
them formula and they made it this weird platforming thing and what i really hate
is that for whatever reason like some monsters you have to hit multiple times uh just for you
know because we just didn't want to note them with single monsters doing double monsters said
sometimes the monsters will be flying but these aren't the ones that you jump to hit you only
jump to hit when you see the marker that says jump and then a monster that you hit like it just
i didn't like playing it it wasn't fun and the music is okay but it's not at the same level
as theater them to me and the final fantasy series maybe it'll be more interesting when
they have let it go i don't know but the songs that they have in there now were not
that great to me so that's it and bobby blackwolf in chat says yep i knew it i also wasn't very
happy with the demo i wanted theater them um let's see uh i'm trying to see if there's other
comments there uh phoenix 77 26 says not gonna lie i'm kind of tired of kingdom hearts deviating
as much as they do and akuma jp oh welcome back i haven't seen you in a while akuma jp in chat
says rob let it go um i will i'm gonna let it go straight to the recycle bin and you can kiss my
big butt if you think i'm gonna spend 60 50 on that game maybe 10 bucks on a dumpster sale
later on like in two years time because it is a square enix game after all but i just i'm not
gonna pay that much more than it um shad star six in chat right now and says i liked the demo for
kingdom hearts it's just different and it worked for me well i'm glad it worked for somebody and
you know what bobby hated nino cooney and i ended up really liking that game so you can take my
opinion and throw it away if you want but that is my opinion and i'm sticking to it the demo
was supposed to impress me and make me think they've made some good changes to theater them
and oh maybe i want to see theater them released released like this no i don't no i don't like it
no no the end all right let's move on uh we're gonna get into some gaming news oh
actually i think we do have a few housekeeping things to get into because jamie you wanted to
bring something up right yes so um i'm working on expanding a few things because our blogging stuff
has kind of you know fallen by the wayside you know um and i love writing writing is you know
kind of you know my big thing so um i have created a blog there will be some video content on its way
there will be a related podcast on its way but it's called genexgeeks.com that's g-e-e-x so g-e-n-x
g-e-x.com i have twitter for it which is also genexgeeks um and i'm looking i mean basically
since it's you know gen x it's you know our our generation of stuff although definitely going into
you know the other stuff that we're into because i don't think that interest should be generational
but there certainly is perspective that we have that maybe other people don't
um and it's it's not just you know like i got a lot of stuff for video games i have some nerdy
stuff for you know movies and anime and also some self-care stuff on there like irl stuff you know
like what are what are we doing in the world around us what types of things can we do to help
other people um you know kind of community oriented um and there will i've kept i keep
forgetting to add the pinball thing on there too but so um i'd appreciate it if people would check
it out and leave me some feedback it just started um but i think that um it'd be a little way to
expand i guess my voice as a gamer and as a geeky person you know yeah so let me ask you this
because i already know the answer there's going to be other people out there that probably don't so
just to let you kind of state this how is this different than vog it is a very different
perspective because you know vog is basically going to be specifically you know really well
it's kind of hard for me to describe it how did i describe it to you before because
it's it's part i think part but expanded i think um also it's more one person's perspective whereas
the voice of geeks network is really about all of the voices and putting that together
and i think the comparison you and i were talking about was um when we had electric sisterhood that
was a part of the voice of geeks network um electric sisterhood was also a site that had
all their own types of blog posts and all their own types of news and did their own types of
reviews and things that were kind of unique to their perspective and obviously they've moved on
to their new project black compat shout out to that because i'm always going to when i bring
them up um but i think that was kind of like i was saying when you were talking to me about this i
was like oh it kind of sounds like you know like when esh had their own sort of site and the same
thing with a critical myth an anime jam session uh is still around and kind of does their own
anime focused content and articles and things on that site so yeah and i was also thinking that i
mean a network isn't necessarily you know an audio or visual thing right right you know and if what i
have to say on there resonates with people who maybe you know and not to say anything about you
guys i love you guys but maybe they want to hear somebody who is not a cisgender man and has you
know a different perspective well you know i to be fair we're really trying to not have that always
be the case you know we try to mix that up i know but i just threw it out there as an example or say
that you know if someone's looking for a little bit more of a lifestyle thing like hey what what
is self-care for someone of our generation what is this you know can you teach me how to adult the
answer is no um you know so i'm really looking on kind of expanding what geekery in the real world
is about does that make sense i think so i think uh you have to go check it out and it'll make more
sense i like what ej ron meh said um uh vog is all ages genics geek real shit yeah this is kind of
like how i'm taking it like you know i've already written a couple of articles about um supernatural
ending i've done um i've actually got two cosplay articles coming and they're just really short
because i mean that's the thing i want it to be quick and easy and digestible so i have two
articles coming up from some prominent cosplayers and actually one of them is my friend annie who
um does uh saver podcast and uh stuff mom never told you and um i also have uh another one from a
really good cosplayer from rkd cosplay um i asked for like one question and got a big write-up so
said i'll just do this all you then um um and i'm looking for you know people if if they want to uh
you know if they have something to say i'll give them i'll give them a spot um i'm actually working
out something with my friend hillary who runs a 28-year salon here in the sacramento area
um about uh you know things like hair care and stuff like that but you know because there's this
whole big trend now for you know hair colors and stuff that you see you know in video games
and anime and stuff um so we'll be talking about stuff like that you know it's it's really geek
lifestyle you know but for those of us who have maybe a little bit more money than you know the
the younger ones um you know maybe people who have a lot more like real life stuff going on
people maybe who have uh physical limitations you know due to you know like i'm 44 and i have
arthritis in my hips so i can't go out and play all the ddr in the universe like i used to so i
would be talking about well what are ways that you can protect yourself when you're going out to play
a high impact video game you something like that so that's kind of you know kind of my thing for
those of us who remembers when mtv played videos for example all right so everybody check that out
it's gen x geeks with an x.com right yeah i get that right okay thank you um and i will say on
the vog front we have some exciting stuff coming soon we just need to cry i can't say much more
than that just we got across the t's and dot some i's but a very some very good conversations were
had behind the scenes and uh i'm hoping we got more to say in a couple weeks that's all i can
really say for now so um i've probably already said too much so let's move on uh let's get into
some news so loki we're gonna start with you tonight with some gaming news yeah so the ps4
just received the 8.0 update making some tweaks to the party and messaging functionality
some of this stuff is also going to be tied into the playstation 5 as well so what they did was
they kind of streamlined everything changing the ui with that they also have this nice mute all
option as well some new avatars that you can choose from and simpler parental controls
one of the other things though that they did mention with this though is basically there's a
a little warning message that pops up says following this update users are seeing a
notification about party safety and that voice chats and parties may be recorded voice chat
recording for moderation is a feature that'll be available on the playstation 5 when it launches
and will enable users to record their voice chats on ps5 and submit them for moderation
review i'm assuming not your own voice chats but like other people obviously on the voice chat you
know so they can ban those rude people or whatever um but basically it's just letting you know that
if you're playing with somebody on a playstation 5 that your voice chat may be recorded as part of
their functionality um of course people are kind of concerned that sony listening to my voice chats
no that's not what they're doing apparently they don't have time to do that stuff but do you think
okay let's well let's be honest there's going to be people that have those series and and they
could be right or wrong could they be listening for phrases like you know and i'm going to use
this as an example in case i set something off on twitch okay just for the purpose of discussion
but let's say someone says a phrase like i'm going to blow up a federal building you know or whatever
it is or they're talking they're making those sorts of plans and i don't know why you would
use playstation to do it but we've heard about those types of groups congregating in in places
you wouldn't necessarily think of because they're less monitored so could sony system listen for
those types of phrases i mean i guess it's within the realm of possibility since everything listens
to you nowadays but um my thing though is and i i think someone brought the um idea up is let's say
that you do get i'm assuming not let's say that let's let's just assume that the only
that the submission by users isn't the only way that they're monitoring everything let's just say
that they are listening for key phrases like that well if that's the case that's done by an
algorithm and we know that algorithms are not necessarily the most accurate or best thing to do
i mean but obviously with the kind of volume that they're going to have that's the only way they can
do it but it's not 100 accurate and we have seen in the case of like youtube and twitch and stuff
that there can be false bans from some of that stuff and with not a lot of moderation that could
get out of hand pretty quick my understanding though is i think if you do get banned
um with that kind of uh based on something like that that you actually lose access to your
playstation library that you have as well um because you'd be locked out from your account
i'm not sure if that's necessarily 100 accurate that's just the concerns i've heard but i think
maybe taking a little bit too far i am glad that they at least have an option to submit a chat if
there is and i don't even know if they'd necessarily be a party chat per se because
i doubt you'd be having people in your own party that are being ridiculous that yeah you're being
absolutely rude i would think it's more of just regular in-game audio where you have somebody that
you know is is being toxic one of those little a-holes that's saying you know f-word f-word
n-word n-word right and so i would assume that you know as part of that you could report them
and then it would be record but to be able to do that though it would have to be recording your
audio at all times so well you know yeah here's the other thing too and and it's interesting
because in chat um uh they're saying uh what was the comment here uh try dean and chat says rob
shouldn't have said that look i went out of my way to make sure i was saying is for the purposes
of news and discussion only uh and there's a fifth dream in chat says that's exactly what
i'll tell the secret service when they arrive at my door tomorrow fifth dream in chat says they're
already reviewing the policies after reading reading feedback from users well i mean and to
be fair to look at both sides of this so i give you that side but then the other side i'm going
to give you is isn't the playstation 4 already recording things it's recording your gameplay for
15 minutes it's taking screenshots whenever it wants because when the game when something crashes
on your playstation 4 and i know this because it happened in no man's sky not that long ago like
just less than two weeks ago i was playing no man's sky and and i had a random crash and it said do
you want to attach a video and all this of your gameplay so your ps4 is already watching you no
of course it is because they have the share functionality and that's why when you push the
button to record a short video it's of footage that you've already played so it is recording
a short bit of your gameplay already um but it's just it's not really doing anything with it i i
don't really necessarily have a huge problem with it um i don't either because i kind of think it's
already happening exactly you have to be completely naive if you don't believe that everything's not
being monitored i mean there's if you're using a service obviously it's gonna have their caveats
and it's you know just privacy concerns aside you know if it'll make the online um environment
better like we're gonna see less toxic people because of it then that's cool um what i want
to know because i haven't used playstation 4 why i haven't played my playstation 4 in a long time
um i'm curious if the playstation 4 chat functionality is like as easy it was like on the
xbox 360 is kind of what i remember where you can actually kind of do a chat people can be playing
different games you know and that type of thing it's easy to invite people in and that type of
stuff i don't know if that's ever been that easy on playstation 4 i don't know well hopefully this
is better um um act f says yeah you can um ssh100 matt and it has a really good comment here um
that i want to read says the main thing um is sony and others have to do something to fix
online harassment if it has to be done this way i totally get it one of my issues with it is that
sony is handling it who has a history of data security kind of wish a different firm was
handling it so maybe bringing in a third party to take care of that or something hmm um at def
points out uh with that scenario you were bringing up loki we do that for our overwatch sessions
since some of our players play stuff like fall guys and genshin impact so all right well um
yeah i know my firmware update already uh came through for the playstation 4 so uh there's that
was there um anything else we want to talk about here with the playstation updates um yeah so i did
want to mention that they're also revamping the playstation store um i believe this is mainly
referring to their web and mobile store so they're removing playstation 3 playstation vita and
playstation portable um games and add-ons along with apps themes and avatars for those platforms
as well so apparently the web and mobile versions of the store um should be done removing those by
october 28th and then apparently if you need access to those after the fact you're gonna have
to access those through those devices so like the playstation 3 or whatnot um
i kind of wish it wasn't going that way because that kind of i mean you know with the whole
backwards compatibility stuff i guess they're just not going to support that stuff anymore
um i don't know i wonder how long until they just pull the plug all together on the psp store
and then the ps3 psp yeah i can understand a lot of that stuff um it's pretty old but
yeah it is unfortunate uh fifth dream in chat says rip psp yeah i i have a feeling that's coming uh
sooner than you might think that they're just going to pull the store all together on that
and decide not to run that anymore because it's probably just not worth it to them they're
probably not selling a lot although i would think the psp second hand market is still pretty big
i mean do those machines have a good lifespan i don't know like i mean
not with the batteries man all those batteries i think we talked about like oh yeah all the
i had to throw mine away well actually it's funny i had like um i had like four psp i had my psp
um 1.0 and then i had 2.0 and then my co-worker gave me two of his um psp's as well because they
were kind of defective or whatever use and i did just the disk drives on them didn't work but you
could still use them for like other games um but all of them all of the batteries i had are all
just complete trash now i'm like it's not worth it i don't care anymore i have i have i still have
my somewhere i i was looking for it earlier this week but um i still have my um my playstation tv
so um i mean i could play all that stuff on there i'm just have to find it i found my steam
or steam link but then not my playstation tv all right well let's move on and talk a little bit
about it's funny because i was talking about nino cooney and i kind of name check and bobby
blackwolf earlier in the show so maybe he's celebrating over this news i don't know but
i think this is kind of sad actually and that is that level five is uh pretty much done in
north america it sounds like um level five international america which was of course
uh the company that brought us nino cooney as well as yokai watch uh here in the north america
uh they're pretty much done and this is according to a report from gameindustry.biz
uh talking to multiple sources familiar with the matter uh they're saying that level five
international america and level five abby began winding down in mid-2019 which included laying off
the staff um so that they were let go uh and uh yeah apparently uh the coo yukari hayakawa who's
the coo of level five abby departed the company in early 2020 even though her linkedin has apparently
not been updated yet but i know a lot of people who have out-of-date linkedin so um what's what's
a ceo of a co of a company um so yeah apparently this is just saying that basically uh this could
be the end of level five releases in north america now i want to point out level five is still around
in japan this is again level five closing down their business in north america which could be
a sign that things like yokai watch and you know cooney were not maybe catching on as much as it
was hoped they would and i know especially in the case of yokai watch like they really pushed that
stuff hard and i didn't think that game was bad by any means uh but i was kind of surprised at
how much they were pushing you know the anime the toys and the game really hadn't proved itself yet
and i'm not sure it ever did at least here in america now i know in japan it was craziness
but even the craziness of that franchise in japan has died down a lot from what i understand so
i just don't think it was able to sustain itself in america anymore um so yeah any uh any releases
in north america apparently not happening because level five had said yokai watch 4 was going to
happen back in july 2019 but nothing has been said then since then there was also supposed to be a
version over here of inazuma 11 uh the hero's great road but again nothing here the last release from
level 5 in north america snack world the dungeon crawl gold which i never heard of but i know level
five did a lot of random dungeon crawlers like didn't they do an adventure time related one at
some point i think they did so i don't know um let's see and bobby blackwolf like to point out
i never celebrate closures so fair enough but you didn't help no i'm just i'm just i'm being a brat
akuma jp says oh eek they blow up on yokai watch yokai watch is not selling anymore here so yeah
so i thought i had heard that that it really kind of fizzled in japan it used to be a huge huge thing
and it kind of uh sj100 matt says this is surprising act dev says isn't level five behind
the latent series 2 oh i think you are right um but we haven't seen one of those games in a while
too and perhaps the end of the 3ds yes they could make those for switch but maybe they're just not
going to for whatever reason yeah this kind of came out of left field for me too i i thought
level five had some good stuff um i you know usually when i saw their name on a title i would
kind of give it a second look because i enjoyed their stuff you know despite the banter we have
going on i enjoyed nino kuni although i didn't ever pick up the sequel so maybe i'm part to blame
for that i tried yokai watch i didn't get into it as much but i never really beat a pokemon game
until finally pokemon shield finally uh broke that for me where i actually played that start
to finish and the end game so i don't know so anyhow uh yeah too bad to hear about that you
know again and like bobby said on a serious note note uh closures are nothing to celebrate about
this is sad news and you know especially for those of us that like to see a lot of the you know games
in japan released here as well um it's it's some sad news that's for sure so um is dark sakura
back by chance i don't know if she's just off i am okay hi hi sorry no i was uh i was eating a food
oh you're fine i just wasn't sure if i needed to buy time or not but we can go to your story if
you're ready no i um my story is actually going to be probably the first one of this company's
products that i am going to buy oh please tell us more so there is um i'm sure we're all familiar
with analog analog is responsible for giving us their own a super famicon and super gen super
super genesis mega drive you know sega genesis etc um versions of it you know they've had 1080p
output and all of this beautiful stuff um they are now as i'm sure no one is surprised by this
i'm going to be doing a turbo duo um for the turbo graphics 16 slash pc engine with the you
know built-in duo add-on um it will come in a a white one like the japanese or a black one like
the us and it's gonna be 200 bucks which is actually pretty low priced for one of analog's
uh you know uh systems the other good thing about this one is that it is going to be able to play
um uh both uh regions a few cards it does not use software emulation um and instead uses field
programmable gate array chip um so it's basically simulating the game system by hardware um it will
be um arcade card ready it will run all turbo graphics 16 pc engine super graphics which of
course there were like what eight games that were released um uh pc engine cd rom 2 are
super arcade cd rom games so like i said arcade card games um and basically um it's also going
to have a wireless controller but it does have the nec port on it to allow you to use original
duo controllers and multitaps so um it also like i said it's going to support other bluetooth and
usb controllers um it uses hdmi so it will allow you it will output to 1080p um and given what
i've seen from the other outputs on other systems it's going to be pretty pretty awesome um it was
always nice and clear didn't they do that game boy that came out not that long ago that was
it was all over the internet yeah okay and of course it's going to have an add-on for that
thing for the analog pocket um it's going to have an adapter that lets you play um the other hue
cards the turbo graphics 16 super graphics and pc engine hue cards um and i mean that'll be that'll
be pretty nice i mean i have a turbo express and it's kind of difficult to play on i'll be
perfectly honest just don't play your shooter games on it um so it's i think it's really nice
and it's about time and i'll be honest you know i've been pricing a duo rx so that i um wouldn't
you know i have i basically have arcade card games that i can't play like i have a fatal
fury special i have strider and i can't play any of them um so this right here i was going to be
paying about 250 for my duo rx you know for one in a really good shape boxing you know everything
um the hue card converter that i want is almost always sold out and runs about 100 bucks by itself
i have a core graphics but i can't you know again play um duo games on it you know that i would need
the core graphics in the duo and then the arcade card and i can't use those cards on my us duo
because the pin set was different so um this right here is going to eliminate a couple of
other products that i would have been spending money on i mean i was seriously looking to spend
like roughly 300 350 to get to do rx and get myself the us u card converter so we just had
the one system um so this right here is i think it'd be a fantastic deal i can plug it in um on
my hd uh you know my nice fantabulous 4k tv and um not have any input lag which is one of the
biggest problems with playing retro systems on modern televisions right so you know could the
limited availability of this be an issue because bobby is speaking up on this a lot in chat saying
this was cool until they said limited quantities which means nobody will actually be able to get
one i really question their business practices if they can't actually meet the demand at the price
they quote this sounds great for the boders that will buy and flip it on ebay just like the last
analog plot product i learned to never hype for them well i mean it works for nintendo all t l
shade um i might be reaching out to a potential contact um to bring up uh i'm hoping because i
want to do like a full review of it um so i'm i'm gonna be trying to do some some reaching out and
seeing who i can talk to and well you know to to be fair yay for you if that works out but
the point still stands that you know it's it's way too limited and why is it so damn limited
if the demand is a bit higher you know and i think there's going to be another release
if well let's hold out let's hope but i guess maybe the track record hasn't really spoke
kindly for that because that would be really unfortunate if it just becomes a thing that
scalpers on ebay kind of get it would be nice to see the company maybe do some sort of you can sign
up to pre-order one or something like that you know kind of trying to figure out that system
because the popularity and the fact that you know the these products have been all around the news
sphere when it comes to video games they've been all over social media and everybody is saying
these look really cool it's a compliment to the company and everything but surely the company's
got to kind of realize that it puts a certain demand out there and if they can't meet that
demand it could it could backfire if that that's that's a good point but but i you know
i want to see if maybe we can reach out and see if maybe we can talk to the people there and see
if they're going to be doing anything to combat that you know the the big scalper resale because
i mean it's it's certainly a possibility um and i know that it'd be a big problem in the end they
make their money so it is what it is yeah but it's up to us to not buy from scalpers but
we all know like we can sit here and say that till we're blue in the face but there's going
to be somebody that sits on top of their mansion and you know beverly hills that has the screaming
child mommy mommy mommy i saw this on the internet i want one buy it buy it and so they just go on
ebay and get it you know and it's okay veruca yeah well i mean and that's that's the problem
is that we can sit here and say we're gonna we're not gonna support it right it's trash
but the veruca's of the world are gonna and the enabling parents are gonna ruin it
yeah so it stinks we'll see but i i do think to be fair i think this is a problem bigger than
just this company this is a problem we're seeing all over the place you know in this industry and
fifth dream says cough ps5 cough you know we had all the issues with the pre-orders there as well
and so on so i i i kind of get it so all right um let's move on though for now um just for time's
sake i can't spend too much time on one topic because we had such a great um kickoff topic
that went on for a while but let's move on to our next topic because this is this is i mean
this is huge this this in a normal week could have been a whole three hour show to itself right well
i think it's huge it says it's so this right here by itself is not much so basically what the deal
is is game stop and microsoft had entered into a multi-year strategic partnership um that's going
to basically outfit their stores with surface tablets and it's also going to revamp their whole
pos system as well um allowing them to use like microsoft 365 and teams and stuff like that
also with that though they're also doing some sort of it's not really in great detail yet but
they're doing some sort of partnership where it'll allow them to sell digital products that are on
the microsoft store and actually get a cut or i'm sorry no what's going to happen is i hear is
that they're going to be getting a cut of any of the digital sales from consoles that they sell
so for example if they sell some xbox series x those consoles that they sell any users that buy
those and make purchases they get like a percentage of that which is interesting here's what i think
is happening from what i was hearing so if they think about it though like you know they're giving
them all this access to these things how far away do you think we are from microsoft buying out game
stuff because they're they're struggling money-wise right now they're really struggling to to stay
afloat and so i'm wondering if we're not far enough or not that far away from an acquisition
well and you know the other interesting thing that i haven't seen in any of the stories talking
about this what just happened like four months ago microsoft stores started scaling back significantly
yeah so this has been in the works for a little bit why why would they you know i think that was
the first thing because we kind of at the time we're like well this seems kind of i mean i guess
it must be related to the pandemic and that's sad and all this stuff but now it's kind of like oh
shit they scaled back the microsoft stores because they knew they were going to be getting into the
game stops basically everywhere with this whole thing um now again uh you know it's not like
you're suddenly it's going to be microsoft exclusive at those places that's not the case
you can still buy a playstation 5 you can still buy a switch but it is definitely going to put
a little pressure on the folks that work there the management which will trickle down to the workers
that hey if we make continued money off of microsoft's uh sales on an xbox series s now
we know why game stop would fucking bother to carry them because now they're going to be getting
a revenue based off of the the digital sales and on the playstation 5 discless ones there is no
reason for game stop to have any of those they probably will have one or two per store but
there's really no reason for them to carry them or or maybe you know it i would i would think that
there might be an acquisition being that they're they've been closing stores left and right and
they've been in trouble for a while and the pandemic hasn't really helped them out um but
the very least maybe it's just microsoft recognizing this company um needs some
infrastructure upgrades and they're just doing a partnership with them in that sense and on top of
that they're also going to try to push their consoles and um i don't know i don't know if
they're necessarily going to buy them out i mean we'll see it'll be interesting to see what happens
with this but i know that financially i don't think they're doing very well um with the pandemic
and everything i find this comment from questposter really fascinating um because i really agree with
it uh saying game stop stock is up 120 plus percent for the year but not because of this news
some analysts don't think that this is that huge since the winner is mainly microsoft
seemingly taking advantage of a weak game stop to push people into their ecosystem hell yeah they
are and it's it's it's a brilliant move by my it's straight up genius by microsoft i'm sorry like
that's it that's that's what it is because now when it comes to the holidays and the lost parents
that are like what do i get my kid my kid's been talking about xbox and playstation i don't know
the difference although again i think the parents of today grew up on the same stuff i mean we're
old enough to be the parents now loki is a parent many of you out there listening are so i'm not
sure this is always going to be the case but i think still in some parts of the country in some
areas you're going to have people to walk into the game stop going i i know my kid wants this
but i don't know what i need to get like the default answer is going to be pushing towards
microsoft products now and that is a brilliant move on microsoft's part uh right yeah so they'll
have two different friends because i think also when you like there's a definite value propositions
be made with you know the xbox platforms um i'm just curious to see what sony's going to answer
back with as far as like what they're offering i just don't think playstation now is going to be
enough to cut it and i'm sorry like cool that you're giving away a few games with playstation
plus but that's not the same as the entire library that's in games pass i mean it's just not the same
well you know and i i don't want to base the reality based off of what i see on social media
but it doesn't seem like sony's exactly struggling like it seems like plenty of people are still
pre-ordering a playstation 5 and there's plenty of games on there that people want to play and
i think that is sony's biggest strength still is that they do have this very strong first party
titles still and they're gonna have that you know for some time but you know as i've been saying
until i'm blue in the face on the show for a long time now don't count off microsoft this time
around and akuma jp in chat is saying i wonder if japan will be able to play bethesda games now
um akuma the reality is and i realize you're gonna laugh at this and microsoft still thinks
they can succeed in japan um but they're playing the long game it's not something that's necessarily
going to happen tomorrow and part of succeeding in japan is really starting to turn the heads here
in the states and then i think they're gonna hope that that carries out but i the quickest way to do
it and you know we've been saying this forever is is still shocked that microsoft didn't just
fucking outright buy sega or um konami or somebody that is feels a little bit vulnerable in the
japanese market and i kind of think that's the big that's the big grand finale that's the big
symbol clash that ends 2020 is that microsoft's gonna buy a japanese company i think but we'll see
yeah still time dj rama s in chat says microsoft will not succeed in japan
because they don't have any japanese game studios under their belt yet
they don't have any under their belt yet
and i think i laugh laugh in my face if you want but let's revisit this in a year and see what
happens we shall see we shall see all right for now though let's move on and talk about some
upgrades uh for the xbox 360 that's right the the older system the xbox 360 cloud saves are now
going to be free so you can actually just get your saves in the cloud for free this was something that
you had to have xbox gold for before oh look at that another xbox gold feature just getting
absorbed into something else huh huh huh anyway it's gonna be free now on the xbox 360 because
they want people to have their savings in the clouds to feel a little more like they can get
an xbox series s or a series x because you know some people just skip the xbox one outright in
fact a lot of people did that may have owned the 360 but maybe now the series s or x is going to
look at bringing them back so how can they transfer their maybe they have a file in oblivion
that they've spent 200 hours on so they want to be able to move that over to the xbox series x
because we know that series x and s are going to be backwards compatible uh pretty richly uh if
it's uh something you can play on the xbox one today you'll be able to play it on the xbox series
x now if it has enhancements or not we'll get into that a little later um but it it will be
nice that you know and it's not all the systems do this so it will be nice that hey even if you
are skipping a generation so you're on xbox 360 now you skip the one and you go your games are
still going to be backwards compatible mostly there are some 360 games that don't work as we
all know but the big ones they they figured out and the ones that you probably have a 200 hour
save file on probably uh figure that one out how to make it backwards compatible so that's kind of
neat um but i also think it's kind of funny that uh they figured out a way to just completely um
absorb yet another xbox live gold feature into something else so anyway uh now let's talk a
little bit more back about those backwards compatibility games because it came out this week
that there's going to be 31 series x or s optimized games on day one so obviously because
halo isn't making the release day a lot of the strength that microsoft's trying to push for
their launch day windows is upgrades of older games so um let me read you some of the highlights
i'm not going to read them all assassin's greed vahala borderlands 3 dead by daylight dirt 5
uh the falconeer forza horizon 4 gears 5 gears tactics grounded manifold garden or in the will
of the wisp planet coaster sea of thieves tetris effect connected the tourist uh watchdogs legion
yakuza like a dragon uh and so on again that's just a selection of the 31 games there that are
going to be available on day one so this is kind of microsoft's strategy is not just the new new
stuff like vahala is a new game so not just that but then also like here are the older games and
even i kind of went oh shit i can't wait to play forza horizon 4 on the xbox series x that's going
to be awesome and now hearing that they've bumped it up a little bit you know i don't know exactly
what that looks like but i imagine that's going to be some higher res texture and probably some
yeah it's going to be a real smooth frame rate i'm sure so i that game's going to be pretty badass
i think so excited for that so we'll see uh we're getting to less than a month away now if you can
believe it before the new consoles both xbox series x and s and the new playstation fives are
out pretty much in the same week and it's what the 10th and the 12th right did i get those dates
right the 10th is the xbox the 12th in the playstation i know the 10th is the xbox i can't
remember the place i think it's the 12th so they're right they're right on top of
each other practically and we're less than a month away so uh yeah pretty exciting times
that's for sure all right how about dark sakura what's next well i've made no secret one of my
favorite games ever is fantasy zone and there is a game being released that is an homage to fantasy
zone called endless zone um it actually has come out uh a couple of days ago it's on pc via steam
and it's part of sega's 60th anniversary um and it's only going to be available until the 19th
until tomorrow so um basically it is you know pretty much just like fantasy zone but you play
instead of as the opa opa you have op bot um who was a field surgeon and organ recovery specialist
and then one day he was on the run and he has to flee and exist so go check it out because
i i noticed it didn't look very cartoony either i had a very different kind of gritty look to it
it was like fantasy zone rated r kind of look to it it's still you know i mean part of what i liked
about fantasy zone was the the cuteness and the happy music and it's fucking hard as balls
but um but i mean still it's snowmaj remember how the super mario brothers movie was supposed
to be kind of gritty and industrial that's what i kind of got looking at endless zone
well i don't know about the terrible part i didn't play endless zone i'm sure it's fine
it reminds me of like those like um oh what was it like the the xbox 360 arcade games that they
were making like of the classic arcade games and oh they're kind of like kind of redone or like if
we want to talk a little bit more crystal quest was like gritty whenever you talk a little bit
more like recent um you know kind of similar to the stuff that we see now on uh the amico
where like these classic games are kind of getting that uh you know higher res i don't know they still
look like xbox arcade games um you know where it's like they don't know what to do with the
sprites so they just kind of make them a little bit more realistic and they come off looking like
not really a flash game but just i don't know different but yeah this looks kind of like that
okay yeah excited that was uh the week we missed was that whole uh in television stuff that came
out um that was uh the week that i was out um but uh i don't know like i i could see the thing is
though we we say all that but i also kind of go i liked a lot of those early xbox arcade games i
actually played them a lot you know they kind of throw me back to a period of the atari 2600 when
you know i just that that repetition and that same z type of game was a lot of fun to play
it was something very zen about it so like i kind of look at the stuff for the intellivision i'm
like looks like it could be interesting so maybe yeah all right well let's move on and talk about
um loki what you have for us next i'm sorry you just picked up stella too and she's looking all
adorable on your shoulder being ready to start screaming at me again oh uh so as we know with
games getting bigger and bigger um you know especially with call of duty there's been a lot
of different stories about how uh call of duty is too large like their updates are like 150
gigabytes it's just ridiculous so now they're saying that there's going to be um some sort of
updates done to the pc version that's actually going to let you uninstall portions of the game
so apparently you can uninstall 100 gigabytes of stuff the game right now call duty modern warfare
on pc it takes up 232 gigabytes of space i mean that's that's ridiculous yeah uh but apparently
though is i know one of the things that people have been requesting especially for like even
the console versions or um you know talking about what these new consoles coming out even though
they have large hard drives i mean like that's like a 20% of your hard drive right there it's
ridiculous so they're going to split it up so you can actually uninstall like the campaign
multiplayer spec ops that type of stuff so campaign's 35 gigabytes multiplayer is 42
spec ops is going to be 38 so you can pretty much like pick your installation size
um based on what you want in there which they have to do when the game is that large it's ridiculous
yeah that's and especially you know we're looking at we're getting into the new
era of gaming with playstation 5 and xbox series x and so on and the drives really didn't get that
much bigger like you know i know the xbox is shipping with a one terabyte drive well big
fucking deal that's what my xbox one has in it now so and considering we're looking at 4k games
so i mean when you talk about a game that's eaten up 250 gigs of that that's that's too much right
and well at the very least like with these drives um you can uninstall stuff and also there's the
external stuff that you can get for it as well yeah the two terabyte drives that they sell aren't
overpriced which is good it is pretty much on par with which you'd pay for
that type of storage but they're still expensive yes but you're right they're on par but they're
not cheap right so it's just unfortunately it's gonna be you know i i would hope that with this
because i know some of these games are a little bit blown up in size because of these slow read
speeds or read rate speeds of these um storage devices that they have that they're not able to
they have to kind of have redundant information in order to be able to read it quickly and maybe
with these drive speeds speeding up to the point where accessing data from any location on the
drive is going to be super quick that they can cut down on the redundancies and maybe even compress
even more and have you know the dedicated processors to uncompress that as quickly as
possible um maybe with that and advancements with their the storage and everything you'll cut down
but then you're going to also get higher fidelity graphics which will then offset it back to where
we are you know so i don't know i just i hope that they do end up taking options like this
when it is unavoidable that the game is going to be this large that at least chunk it up so that
if for example i'm not interested in playing special ops i don't have to install that 38
gigabyte portion of the file right all right well let's move on and talk about uh some unfortunate
news for blizzard is that they recently i think in the week we were off or i can't time is blending
together now but they within the past couple weeks uh recently closed their office in france
so there was an office in versailles um i say that right thank you versailles uh blizzard
recently had to shut their office in versailles down and that means that was 100 of jobs that
were lost in the middle of a pandemic nonetheless so in comes some unions to try to uh try to
stop this i guess uh so uh some different unions cgt specus unsa and cfe cgc remember we're
talking about france so some of those acronyms are actually french uh they're actually saying
that blizzard denied they had plans to close the office and they act they say that no blizzard's in
fact planning this for a long time and they lied about it uh this comes as a shock for employees
who are not expecting this announcement in 15 years many of us left their homes from across
europe and beyond to join the company people truly invested their whole lives into blizzard's
success so with this uh loss uh 285 jobs are going to be lost with this apparently blizzard
had tried to cut 133 jobs in france when they cut the jobs in america because blizzard laid off
hundreds in america this last i think it was in 2019 some of y'all might have forgot but the
court stopped them so and then they weren't able to do it in march either so maybe because they
were stopped to do it i don't know maybe they just said you know what then we're just going
to close the office all together uh don't know but unions are demanding blizzard stop the closure
develop the europe office and uh invest in prevention of psychosocial risks so um not a lot
of good news on that front but it is interesting that um they tried to do some layoffs and were
stopped and so now they're just like well fuck it we'll close the whole office that part's kind of
interesting um but you know it doesn't seem like blizzard is exactly struggling either they're
getting ready to release a big world of warcraft expansion i know that pre-patch went out and it's
a pretty big deal it's probably the biggest changes the game has seen since the cataclysm
expansion um you know but uh i guess maybe they don't have a new game out yet like nothing on the
level of diablo 4 overwatch 2 to really rake things in but i would think during a pandemic
this is a time when a lot of game companies are flourishing depending on how they're playing their
cards so hmm so we'll see if the unions are able to make anything of this but um i don't know i
have a feeling blizzard might have because of what happened previously might have just said you know
what it's more cost effective for us to just shut down the whole office um but still my heart goes
out to those folks that are affected and uh it's never easy to hear about that especially for that
many people so all right well let's move back to a simpler time shall we we're gonna take a step
down memory lane and talk a little bit about some classic games so every week dark soccer steps into
the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks hey you brats should check this game out it's the
classic game of the week so dark sakura what did you find for us this week um i found some dew
oh really do mr dew yet again so thank him for that but again a game that i cannot believe we
have never featured because i remember playing the shit out of this game at the local yogurt shop
because they had to play the dew out of it yes i did they had a cocktail cabinet of this and i
used to play it a lot ice plays on the clico all the time yeah my favorite games that was actually
something we brought up that there had been the clique of vision version which i i've got too
um so yeah mr dew it is a maze arcade game it was uh developed and published by universal in 1982
it is the first of the mr dew series and um it would sorry it was also one of the first arcade
games to have been released as a conversion kit by taito and it went on to sell 30 000 units in
the us um the object well as dan actually was saying earlier it's dig dug on crack um the object
is to score as many points by digging tunnels through the ground and collecting cherries
mr dew now in the japanese version he was originally a snowman in the us he is a clown
which is probably why i am not the biggest fan of of mr dew because i think clowns are scary
as crap um but anyway um he is chased by these red monsters called creeps and you lose a life
if mr dew gets uh gets caught so the game is over when you've lost your last life easy peasy
the cherries are all over um the level in groups of eight um you get 500 points if you collect
eight cherries in a row without stopping um the level is complete when you've either collected
all the cherries destroyed all the creeps spell extra or you find a diamond um he can defeat the
creeps by bouncing a power ball on them and um but he is defenseless while he while the wall is in
play you know kind of like when diggy duggy puts out his you know puffy blow thingy that sounded
bad anyway um he can also push uh an apple off the edge of a vertical tunnel to crush a creep
kind of like in dig dug how you do the you know the the rock um and then the creeps can transform
into powerful multi-colored monsters that can travel through the ground and if it digs through
a cherry then it leaves fewer cherries and therefore fewer points for mr dew to collect
and if it digs under an apple it will and it's suicide or it can uh drop that apple on mr dew
and mr dew is apparently allergic to apples and will die um you if you pass the score threshold
um uh typically 5000 points a letter for extra will appear on the screen as an apple monster
you have to defeat the monster and then you can uh gather uh your letter and um
if you collect all five letters and you get a cut scene that plays the the theme to astro boy
and you get an extra life um they will eat any apples that they encounter so it makes them
very difficult to crush um the creeps will spawn at the center of the screen and after they have
all appeared then their generator will turn into a food item so you can get bonus points and freeze
the creeps and call up the apple monster and do other stuff um and sometimes dropping an apple
will get you a diamond so if you collect it within 15 seconds it lets you skip past the
level and you get 8 000 points so you also will then get a free game um it was uh developed by
ueda um kazutoshi i don't really know too much about him so there were a bunch of courts of
course there was the atari 2600 atari 8-bit uh computer family uh kalika vision as we mentioned
before um apple 2 msx neo geo uh tomy tutor and the commodore 64 um there also was a handheld lcd
version that was also released by tomy in 1983 now with the kalika version there were some some
changes made to it so if you play that one and then go and play the arcade version you're going
to notice a little bit difference the alpha monsters and sidekicks are unable to eat apples
so they are easier to crush the blue monsters will eat your shrubbery and cherries um also
if an alpha monster is over a letter that has already been acquired then the dinosaur monsters
will just freeze um so uh in japan um for this uh for sorry the june 15th 1983 issue of game machine
mr du was listed as uh the 21st most successful table arcade unit of the year um famicon sushin
awarded the super famicon version of this uh 25 out of 40 um and lots of folks for egm thought
it was was really great um so yeah as far as those other versions i don't know if i mentioned
but yeah there was the uh super famicom snus version um there were other sequels there was
mr du's castle in 1983 mr du's wild ride and do run run haha in 1984 there's expanded 99 level
version of mr du that was released in arcades by electric coin in 1989 there is a new version
called neo mr du uh developed by visco and it was licensed by uh universal for snk neo geo
1997 i believe i have played that one um was mr du also edgy like those old xbox arcade games
nah it's colorful and bright and pretty um mr du was adapted to the gameboy and super famicon
also had different um gameplay features there's a rebranded adaption of the game that came for
gameboy color it was called quest fantasy challenge holy magic century in europe
developed by imagineer published by sunsoft and uh in for north america and virgin interactive in
europe and it's in the quest series of games instead of mr du there the arcade version was
on we virtual console in japan and april 27th uh uh 2010 so there you go mr du also a game that
had the same name in the u.s in japan how was the sequel not called number two mr duty
because some people are grown-ups rob oh okay uh let's see bobby blackwolf in chat says a port is
a port of course of course unless that port is all borked of course we call it mr du
wamp i remember the commodore 64 version of this because of course i do um and it was uh it was
a lot of fun it played a lot like the arcade it's really it's it's harder than dig dug in
my opinion like um i'm i'm not bad at dig dug like i can get like more than 10 boards
in and dig dug mr du i don't know if i can do that in this game it's it's pretty challenging
check out that awesome cut scene they have though right here where uh the extra life is awarded and
the little i guess that's a creep a dinosaur i don't know i don't even recognize what that
monster is uh waves the red or the white flag i was like why is he trying to attack the uh
the dinosaurs from bubble bobble i don't know but it is uh dig dug on crack so did you ever notice
as you're collecting the cherries it plays this little sequence if you cool i don't think the guy
in the demo we're watching here is doing it fast enough but if you collect the eight cherries it
goes do do do do do do do like it does a do re mi all the way and then if you get it all the way
the end you actually get like a bonus i always thought that kind of interest that little musical
cue was really cute and interesting and something that again i know a lot of people really equate
this to dig dug because it is a digging game but they're very different they are very very
different in the way they play yeah but there's enough similarity that the the comparison makes
sense i like that fifth dream do re mi mr do forget it what if we don't know it makes sense
what if we were calling it wrong the whole time and it was mr do
it's mr do it's when you read the the kana for it it's do so i guess i believe you all right
there it is your classic game of the week mr do uh which i guess was given to us by proxy via dan
um but thanks too well and you brought me up you like you've played this before though at least
jamie right a couple of times at least on multiple variouses so yeah all right well let's
get into some rapid fire news that was a good choice again it was one of those games i'm like
how are we 800 plus episodes in and we've never done mr do because i know i i played as shit i'm
surprised in one of the weeks you weren't here i didn't pick it but i guess i just never thought
of it there you go probably thought it was already chosen before i probably did all right that's
that's the joy i did a search for mr do on the page for the classic game i didn't find it i
remember having done it i searched for do and there was like 800 results i was like okay i
searched for mr and there was one result you picked a mr something else way back when but
it wasn't mr do it was something else some other mr mr driller uh maybe probably yeah no i don't
even think it was that now i have to go look all right well anyway uh let's move on though we got
some rapid fire news coming your way so loki start us off please yeah so this is kind of
interesting so uh sorry mr important update mr mosquito was the game thank you no one special
yeah yeah now i remember yeah um sega has decided to release a prototype version of a cancelled
golden axe game um for their sega 60th anniversary um calling it golden axe a cancelled prototype
um apparently it was a game that's being developed by sega studios australia back in 2013
and it's a 2.5d remake of the classic series the it's kind of being met with mixed uh reception
because the game itself while it was cancelled apparently while it was in development was under
a lot of crunch and so it's bringing up uh bad memories from that but it is interesting to be
able to check out something that it was um in development at one time if you want to check it
out for free you can find it on steam um and it actually got released today for a limited time
so go check it out while you can neat um i wish they maybe were a little more respectful in how
they went about doing it but i think it's cool that like companies are willing to put out these
you know demos and products that didn't really see the light of day i think it's pretty cool
yeah um and then of course i've been looking forward to a minecraft movie but unfortunately
that's not going to be coming out anytime soon release has been pushed back for the foreseeable
future so originally it's supposed to be coming out in 2022 however the latest release from
warner brothers their production schedule does not now list it on um their production schedule as a
movie that will be coming out in the near future here um of course you know they have other movies
that are coming out as well a fourth matrix movie the new suicide squad the batman dune black adam
so there's a lot on their plate and unfortunately minecraft is not part of that as of right now
why not god you think there's a pandemic going on or you would think you would think you'd be
a good idea but i don't know hopefully it's still popular in a few years movies are a little harder
to make right now i guess especially when they're well too so oh that'd be a little less i would
think but i don't know i hope it's not live action that would be terrible no i think it's an anime
movie actually having followed a couple of behind the scenes just for current tv production um they
have some crazy rules that they have to follow to maintain safe uh safety on set and quarantine so
that would make sense for any kind of movie filming especially anything that's uh that's uh
studio based you know what i mean instead of a location and i don't think i talked about an
olr but i did an indie movie actually it's it's it's like a um it's like a film festival it's
gonna be online but i did uh a thing so i had to do a movie set basically uh it was that you know
small indie type of thing but still so uh and that was during all this that was just uh about
a month ago that i did that so because i think that's coming out next week and honestly it could
be that i don't know like what you know just because it's not listed now doesn't mean maybe
they just don't know where it's gonna go yet um the furthest date out that they have right now
is shazam fury of the gods which is uh moving from november 4 2022 to june 2nd 2023 um
so i mean it still could be somewhere they just don't have a date for it yet i mean i don't know
we'll we'll see i mean it's still a long ways out anyways even if it wasn't being delayed all right
well moving on to talk about xbox game pass and some pretty interesting additions coming to that
uh lucasfilm uh or excuse me not lucasfilm lucasarts which you know is part of that i guess
but lucas art remastered classics uh are coming to xbox game pass so sadly not the actual classics
that would have been rad on pc game pass uh but we get the remasters which are cool in their own
own right so we're getting full throttle grim fandango and day of the tentacle um so you can
play these remasters on xbox pc or android with cloud syncing and all that cool stuff um so yeah
these games of course all originally came out in the 1990s but then they were redone later on when
double fine entertainment bought the rights to those titles and went on to remaster them
uh microsoft of course remember bought double fine remember that so this is those rewards
coming back now so uh yeah there you go these games are going to be hitting game pass on october 29th
i'll i'll be checking them out for sure because i think i played i think i played the day of
the tentacle but that was the only one i checked out so i want to check out the other ones uh for
sure and uh in a bit of a developer shuffle around uh changing news uh crackdown 2 the developers
behind that game ruffian games is now operating as rockstar dun d because they are joining
uh all the other rockstar studios i don't know what they're working on but you can imagine that
crackdown 2 was some would say the last decent crackdown game oh so right loki i mean it was
unfortunately that that is a true statement yeah so uh who knows what they're doing uh this studio
though they had ported and remastered the old halo games so maybe they're making sure that
grand theft auto 5 is running on new consoles or maybe red dead redemption um who knows or maybe
they are going to be working on something we've been working on the agent game that we've been
promised for decades oh god right uh and and who knows maybe they're working on something new
that's kind of inspired by crackdown series a little bit like you know they could kind of do
something a little different so who knows finally get the sequel to rockstar's table tennis it's
coming hey that game was awesome all right dar sagra what do you have i have a mute button
apparently um but also um a little bit more news about um rock band 4 it's going to be
a completely compatible with ps5 and xbox series x um it is uh basically you know they're wanting
to keep it up to date so that they can keep playing it with the newer ones and then of course
there is uh all of those licenses that people are dealing with though from having their earlier
versions um and they're saying that of course all of their uh their controllers that came out
apparently all of it is supposed to work on the new stuff as well um and then they are working
on cleaner transfer for the dlc um information um so that it's supposed to be a lot easier than
it was um and then uh the license for rock bands three songs going to rock band four expires on
december 1st so you have one last chance to get that but you need the rock band three disc and
then sorry sorry about it sorry not sorry um in other news um and you might not be surprised to
find out that i've purchased this fib ribbon on vinyl soundtrack being put out by minimum records
in the uk black screen records also in the uk and then ship to shore which is the us one um i
24 bucks definitely not bad um but yeah it's um the uh the music uh game produced by uh nana
all the cute little the the be debris singing stuff so yeah it's cool oh yeah i was gonna
text shane about this because he collects uh vinyls he likes the vinyl soundtracks and uh
i forgot is he still this one's going this one's going in a frame and going on my wall and i'll
tell you what i will just uh i'll send shane a little note right now thank you uh say i forgot

much for me too scary way too yeah i i i love i mean it it so i mean it's a little scary i
guess but it's more fun it's just like an arcade shooter and plus it's got that kind of it's it's
just a really cool game um which unfortunately i don't think we'll ever get a sequel but like it's
it is such it's like a definitive vr game that you gotta get on the playstation vr

cart and a goat that's shrieking as you go through the supermarket it's on game pass
yeah yeah speaking of which um i did want to mention supermarkets we've got relaunched i
guess today that was tonight it was it's up against our show so stop reminding the viewers
they have something else to go watch but yes that is that did start tonight you know what i finally
watched too um while i was on my little trip number one i finally finished all four seasons
of the good place finally which was finally well worth it it was such a good show i highly
recommend it um and then i also finally saw the pressure luck revival i hadn't seen it this whole
time i just you know i'm always playing games or whatever um so i finally sat down watch that
because i i watched an episode some guy almost won the whole thing like won a million bucks or
something is there another one um yeah they relaunched pressure luck uh last year i think
and it's um what's her name effy trinket in hunger games she hosts it elizabeth banks
before right oh yeah like in the 2000 era the whammy no no that was terrible this one the
nice thing about this one this brings back like it's the it does what a lot of the abc shows do
and it brings back the same set and the whammies and little cartoon animations in the 80s but they
made them new things but they're still that same style so they kept everything that works and
obviously they had to change the host because peter tamarkin you know died um so they changed
the host but elizabeth banks she works she did a good job so cool okay yeah reda repulsa also was
her big role so um yeah that was good i saw that and uh yeah the supermarket sweep is leslie jones
which love her i can't see how that's bad uh card sharks joel mchale was on tonight too oh lord
yeah so they've been reviving a lot of the old game shows it's pretty interesting and then um
also saw the weakest link came back on nbc but it's not um ann robinson and she was so good there
they have um what's her name the the chick from glee uh jay linch is the host now yeah she's cool
like i like her but it's it's it's her her um i think ann robinson really worked on the weakest
link because she was a bit of an unknown especially here in america but jane lynch
there's something about her demeanor where it feels like she's playing a character and she's
good she plays a good character but it just kind of feels like she's playing that mean teacher on
glee as a game show host and so it's kind of weird i don't know but anyway yeah and that's my that's
my opinion on game shows all right let's move on uh more uh more topics logi all right um so not
surprising because it hasn't been doing too well but apparently the next-gen versions of marvel's
avengers have been delayed uh because apparently crystal dynamics is working on issues with the
game you may not know they're only they were down to a thousand players concurrent recently on the
pc version of that game oh wow so it's just it hasn't really been delivering the promise that
they were making of the game so because of that of course um they are now going back to retool
some of that stuff they said they want to deliver an extra experience showcasing all that this game
is meant to be and uh apparently along with that they're going to be throwing in some
bonuses for players that already have the game as well um fifth dream in our chat says yeah
it's a buggy mess and not fun that's too bad because crystal dynamics really knocked it out
of the park with um the tomb raider games so i don't know was it was this just rushed like
they just didn't have enough time to really put the polish on it you know needed i think it's
just because they're trying to shoehorn it into a um live service game whereas it looks like this
would play more as a single player story driven game which is kind of what they're used to is a
lot of those um single player story driven games um but now they're making them it's anthem all
over again i mean look you've got the you've got a studio that's been um experienced has experience
in making a certain type of game and now you're forcing them to make a game that's a live service
game because money and how did that turn out it turned out well for anthem and it didn't turn out
well for this so it's just i think i saw hopefully we'll be like i think i saw anthem like seven
bucks on the shelf at target the other day and i was like it's still too much it hopefully will
yeah it'll hopefully um get better with time but like sometimes they just give up so yeah it
depends like with anthem yeah you can rescue a game we've seen many cases now there's been several
where a game has completely turned around and fixed what was a problem launch diablo 3 final
fantasy 14 no man's sky you know there's there and there's more that you can probably add to
this list you know so the avengers isn't like completely fucked like it can still turn around
but you're right the developer and the publisher have to kind of commit to turning it around
and you know what we saw like hello games doing with no man's sky that shit is unprecedented
like the amount of shit that that game got and the amount that the developers have stuck to it to
really turn it around and i mean really turn it around is really unprecedented so i mean it's not
it's they could do it it's just will crystal and square and all that be able to have the resources
to do it the good news is square enix final fantasy 14 probably the biggest example of a
turnaround and not just a turnaround but a turnaround that resulted in profit big profit
that game is making square a lot of money so that's the good news we're not talking about
ea now with anthem we're talking about square enix and they've turned around the game before
so it's possible so not all this news necessarily has to be bad well i understand that but like
an mmo and a live service game like this are kind of a little bit different in the sense i think with
an mmo mmo you have a lot more content to consume whereas this game it's kind of grinding the same
missions over and over and over again for experience not only that though with an mmo
i mean you have your monthly fee that you're paying to this they don't have that kind of
laid out here so instead they have all these different like passes that you can purchase to
bought upgrade each individual character is a separate pass it's just it's monetized the hell
and so it it's just it's greedy they see it working with like fortnite and stuff like that
but they have to realize that that's a free to play game like it's different you can't charge
people up for it 60 fee and then like oh but by the way we want more of your money a ton more of
your money um it's just i don't know when they're gonna learn that this is not a a smart way to go
akuma jp in chat says final fantasy is squares bread but avengers is not no true and you know
final fantasy really stuck to we are going to charge a monthly fee for this mmo excuse me
sorry hiccups um and they're only they're one of two companies still in the business
or that do that that are still in the business of that them and blizzard with wow are the only
ones that are still charging a monthly fee to play their game everybody else went free to play
and there was a lot of pressure for for final fantasy 14 i think to go free to play and well
actually they have a really robust free to play experience now essentially uh squares take on it
the first two expansions so the base realm reborn and heavensward are now just free
you could just go play those if you want uh if you want to play the newer stuff like uh storm
blood and shadow bringers then you have to start paying but they're they're offering a lot for free
now it's pretty interesting so yeah uh questbuster says loki hit on another thing that irked me
every tune had to be leveled up separately uh at least in ultimate alliance i could expect my tunes
to somewhat keep with me regardless of whether i had them in my party or not but no let's not
respect the player's time uh she hulk 10 says they should just make a great hulk game now
why would she hulk won a great hulk game
but no i think the hulk is it's a secret to everybody there you go there you go that would
be that's right i'm sorry disney doesn't make games anymore you need to aim higher aim higher
go for the she-hole game all right okay and the follow-up comment or she hulk game
all right i'll take it all right uh let's move on let's talk about the playstation 5 interface
because sony actually showed off the playstation 5 interface this week so we got to see a little
more about it um i'm gonna be honest it was like a 20-minute video and i didn't watch the whole
thing i don't know if you guys did uh loki or what have you um no but basically okay it has
some similarities to what we've seen before although of course now it runs in 4k but you
also have quick access to things like help um you also have the game milestones and how close you
are to certain achievements uh and trophies or whatever are embedded within the game you can see
the progress on the various levels and quests but you can also see guides and hints if you have a
playstation plus membership so you can kind of get an idea of where is this or how do i do this that's
kind of interesting how they're embedding that in there instead of uh and really cutting into
the youtube market for that kind of stuff except yeah i was gonna say except you you do realize
you have a console with youtube and probably a web browser in there and everybody has a phone
and the internet what don't you all have phones no i'm still i but just like yes the console has
youtube but you have to go out of what you're playing to go look at youtube but you're right
the phones are the way a lot of people and like i don't understand like it's gonna be much i
um whatever you know what because do whatever whatever you want to say to like the answer
is simple the answer is simple why would sony want you to go out to youtube to watch a video
when that you could watch their video which someday will have an ad just like youtube
no it's because it's not even that at all it's because they just want to bring some more value
to their playstation plus service that is severely lacking new value is what they're trying to do
all right it's fine no one's gonna use it like no one uses probably the uh whatever they call
it where they you know posting screenshots and stuff internally within playstation
i don't think i ever look at that stuff but it's there now some things that are also worth pointing
out and i think these are really cool you can now do voice dictation for chat so if you don't
so you have to sit there trying to type a message you can just say it into the controller's
microphone and it will hopefully uh dictate the message about as well as your smartphone does
so that's you know it'll dictate it incorrectly which will then get picked up by the other
algorithm that says that you're a terrorist and then you need lost access to all your uh content
so uh you can also send messages with spoiler warnings so if you're gonna send an image that's
late in the game you can have it with a spoiler warning so that way it doesn't ruin it for somebody
that's um a good thought and a good way of planning that out um there's always an explore
section that has kind of a mix of things from playstation games the community i kind of thought
playstation 4 kind of already has that but it's kind of clunky and i don't know if that's just
because the the age of the playstation 4 system or whatever but it's getting a little clunky
uh and the playstation 5 is is definitely moving a little bit faster so that's um it's kind of
interesting so it's not really a complete reinvention of the wheel but you know and i
noticed in chat act f says the thing that caught my eye the most is how fast the interface runs
and i think it is that that nice kind of like quick access stuff you know especially moving to
the solid state drive that's a big chunk of what microsoft has going for it too so i think that'll
be well received no all right let's move on just a few more stories for you guys then we're going
to get to listener roundtable i know we at least have a couple emails tonight so let's get through
these last few stories dark sakura well the writer of silent hill shattered memories is
pitching a sequel um uh sam barlow who was the one behind that in 2009 um really wants to do
something else with silent hill um right now it's just uh pitched as project a um and i'm sorry
it's not project a which is something he's developing with half mermaid studios it's
something completely different um and it doesn't um necessarily mean that it's gonna be picked up
but he's really pushing for it and it could have some subtraction so we'll see um i didn't remember
that as being the greatest in the line of silent hill games but anything that gets us more silent
hill makes me pretty happy so we'll see cool yeah hopefully they don't screw it up yeah
don't fuck it up i just want some silent hill i know it's time for that series to come back
already right right it'll never be as good as you want it to be pixel pakas also points out
sam barlow is the one that worked on her story and telling lies and telling lies was that game
i talked about a few weeks ago um that i thought was really cool what's that yeah her story was
pretty okay too did you play telling lies no oh you should it's it's cool like it's it's
it's like her story it's it's the whole you're looking through video to find things it's great
so yeah all right um let's move on loki so this is to be expected but apparently nintendo has gone
after um a tick tock um user by the name of poke princess um who had 1.9 million followers
now you may be asking well why would they do that well a few reasons number one um she calls herself
poke princess poke of course referring to pokemon um she sells merchandise featuring mu and poke
balls which don't believe that she has the express permission to do and also um being that she is
representing herself with poke in her name probably her only fans page is not something
that they would like to have associated with their nintendo brand so they have filed a suit
against her and gotten her to change her name now to digital princess maybe she just likes fish
okay is delicious yeah but she she's she's got like merchandise that has mu on it i mean it's
like i'm joking really yeah no yeah and that that is the real problem you know i think there's a
narrative out there about nintendo doesn't appreciate that she does adult content and all
this stuff i don't think that is the issue the issue is the merchandise at the end of the day
that's what they have a problem with it's probably the merchandise scott garnered the attention
and the rest was just not you know they can't even if she was like family-friendly wholesome
and stuff like that you can't sell merch with their branding themselves yeah that's
and obviously the adult element of it it does and i again i don't want to slut shame sex industry
worker shame any of that stuff on here like you know uh there's lots of people out there
especially in these pandemic times that are looking to things like only fans to kind of
you know carry it and i it's fine you know you got to make a living where you can make a living
uh in the world's you know in a profession that works for a lot of people um well in
i was gonna say the i just think nintendo doesn't want to even remember they shut down
picto chat because it was possible to send a dick pic to somebody they shut it down for everybody
like they don't even want to have it inferred that pokemon is mixed with adult entertainment
they don't even want to take that risk but the merchandise at the end of the day is the biggest
problem yeah and she's she's basically saying you know nintendo doesn't want people to think i'm in
any way shape or form affiliated with them or that i have a partnership with them it all comes down
to me being an adult entertainer it says nintendo's a family-friendly company so they don't want to
ruin their reputation or anything if people think that me and them are affiliated obviously
really sucks from a business standpoint i have to understand it and accept it because i fucked up
so um i still love nintendo and will forever support them well that's a at least that's a nice
thing to make sure the lawyers get off her back but it's nice it is it is nice yeah so all right
well best of luck to digi princess and you know what it's you can rebrand yourself and still be
successful and especially with the number of followers she has i feel like she's gonna be
she's gonna be okay she just needs to come up with new new new merch but it'll be all right
all right let's move on one more story tonight that has to do with starcraft 2 or lack thereof
i don't mean to be dumping on blizzard tonight sorry i just had two articles about them but
uh blizzard is pretty much done with starcraft 2 this is of course right on the heels of the game's
10th anniversary blizzard has announced they're going to be moving away from making new content
for starcraft 2 and focusing on what's next without saying starcraft 3 but i mean hello
we're not saying we're not saying starcraft 3 but starcraft 3 anyway uh no more uh for purchase in
game content no more expansions for starcraft 2 they will still do season roles they'll do
balance fixes for the fans and the competitive players uh and you know they're saying esports
is still going strong i mean well shit the original starcraft esports is still going strong
so uh yeah i wouldn't expect that that's gonna go away um but that's that's it and if you missed it
starcraft 2 did get a big update for the 10th anniversary so it did go out with a bang
so in july there were new achievements prestige talents and gameplay improvements um with that so
um it's not that you know the game's been supported a lot longer than most games get
supported so there is that ssj100 matt in chat says or more likely starcraft the mobile spin-off
game you shut your mouth and you don't speak that into existence where every gamer has a voice
except you with that comment i'm just kidding all right let's get into speaking of which let's get
into the listener round table uh if you have some questions for us in chat or something you wanted
to hear us talk about please uh get it out there and chat let's uh let's talk about it but i know
we have some emails tonight you guys like to email us every week participate at orange lounge radio
dot com and we read your emails uh live here on air now dark sakura i know you're in the mail
bank two that are official there's two there was one spam email and you have to know what i'm
talking about the one that talks about rankings can you read that without saying the name of the
company it won't load oh damn it wait i i'll have it hold on okay you can do it then i'm gonna read
it because i thought it was is it was interesting you guys will know what i mean when i get to it
hold on i start with the i'll save it for last get to get to the first couple emails and uh
we'll see what happens hello all our longtime lurker here have listened to the podcast
religiously since 2005 but i'm a bit shy to join the live shows preferring to enjoy the show bit
by bit throughout my work week don't judge me please no not judging you no totally not judging
you but at the same time we don't bite like so you know i do well here's the thing let me let
me let me try to meet you halfway just come on sunday night and lurk in the chat because i'm
telling you we're too busy multitasking i have no idea who's watching i can see right now live on
twitch there's 34 watching and maybe 10 active in chat so i know there's people that just have this
on and you're doing other things and that's a-okay like i i'm not that and that's the only time and
as far as i'm going to go to call out lurkers because i know i like to watch certain twitch
channels and i just sit there and don't say anything i just have it on in the background
because it's it's kind of like my background thing going on right now so i do want to just say
don't be don't be scared if you want to come live sunday night but at the same time totally don't i
mean that's why we do a podcast so that you can listen throughout the week so if that's how you
want to do it that is totally fine so um uh i just wanted to bring all of the listeners attention to
a wonderful hidden gem i just discovered on the nintendo e shop called hunt down the only way i
can describe it as a final fight neon samurai and narc had a baby and it was raised by quentin
tarantino in a dingy arcade it's hilarious and rocklessly fun trust me the trailer alone will
sell you on it there's a link to it but i think everyone can find it um this got me thinking when
was the last time you discovered a game that you had never heard of and enjoyed so much that you
can't believe it never gained mass popularity hunt down definitely fits the bill to me and i'd love
to know your thoughts on this topic back to lurking for me thank you all for all you do and the voices
you bring to the community i appreciate you signed tonic vision i appreciate that email
very much thank you you remember well me talking about um patterned i really like patterned um and
there was that other game that i used to play that was like hex based puzzles and gosh why can't i
think of it for anymore because i really loved it um but lately it was it's patterned for me
i really like patterned um i think in the modern type of games you know i'm kind of stealing
something that maybe loki would say but orna just because you know considering it's like a
old school rpg mixed with pokemon go it there are the real world elements of that kind of surprised
more people aren't talking about that game um but i also like being able to control as many
territories as i do so maybe i'm okay with that being a little more underground i go back like
way back to classics actually when i first kind of read that question my brain went to um like
probably the biggest oversight of all time and dark soccer i know you're gonna agree with me
on this the guardian legend that was a game that like deserves way more recognition and um
support than i think it got especially at the time i think it's one of those things now that
there's definitely a cult audience for it and words gotten out i think with time but i think
that would be one and then maybe i'm just in a retro mood or something but i also think of a
game like uh crystalis i don't think was super huge at the time but it was so so good for like
a zelda ish type of game on the nes um that was a game i remember enjoying the shit out of when i
was a kid not a lot of people were super into that so um some comments coming in from our chat room
including uh shane is back saying uh roundabout is that game that's the one with the limo that
just spins over and over and the cutscenes are so bad but like i know and flaco love that game too
they both were talking about how much they love roundabout and i'm like or as i call it
runeboot and i i don't think it's i don't think it's that funny but okay whatever it's okay but
it ends up getting old pretty fast okay um yeah this is folks in chat some some are saying
roundabout is amazing uh some are saying round about the game not the song from yes all right
anyway uh great question and great email thanks so much for that then our other one uh comes uh
well you'll be able to tell the moment that i start the email so hello lr oh yeah i'm all
caught up on past episodes thanks for taking a week off that helped so i'm now able to actually
comment on something mentioned during the last episode regarding sony's decision to universally
make x the confirm button and o the cancel button across all regions including japan at least one of
you pointed out the accessibility feature that allows you to remap buttons however you want
unfortunately this is not a good solution because this changes literally all functions of the button
not just functions pertaining to menu selections for example if the game uses x as a jump button
as other games often do the jump button would now be on oh and while many games have their own
button config functions you'll also be dealing with many games having their own but you'll also
be dealing with incorrect on-screen prompts and the headache of having to remap buttons in literally
every game you play the correct way of handling this would be to give users the option of which
button they want to confirm or cancel heck this option could be rolled out worldwide i suppose
time will tell but i really don't see why this shouldn't be a thing thanks as usual for this
show and have a great week erin yyr um great solution to the problem and i i really have
nothing else to add thank you for the email it's great uh yeah should be just baked into the os but
you're right you brought up a good point it's going to change other things those buttons use
too that maybe is unintended so yeah good good way of framing that all right uh now before i
get bobby really wants to hear this email so i'm going to do chat questions first all right uh just
a quick a couple quick ones from chat sg100 matt says uh today is the 35th anniversary of the nes
coming out in north america do you remember the day you got the nes and what were the first few
games you got aside from super mario brothers yes i do i did not have super mario brothers
that's my first fee i think we talked about this last week so yeah so my uh three games there
because we got it second hand so i had breakthrough bubble bobble and the legend of zelda nice uh my
nes came from sears and it was because i did such a good job uh getting straight a's on my report
card that my mom said okay we can get one because you got straight a's uh and so i bought it and of
course i had the mario brothers dot com but i also had to get the game that everybody was
talking about at school and that was the legend of zelda don't regret that purchase jamie mine
came from my dad and i have no idea where he bought it um i when i got mine he also got me
tetris um and i had uh i've done the game before sky shark which was like my probably one of my
earliest shooters that i played and i absolutely loved it um and later on i was given some games
by my mom's friend ashley who you know rest in peace she's no longer with with us for years um
this is the same lady who told no one she was pregnant didn't change any of her clothes for
her entire pregnancy and her own mother found out when she was giving birth in the bathroom
just leave that there wow so she gave me all of her games after she had her baby um and among them
was the guardian legend nice nice so yep uh dj rama s in chat says non-gaming question are you
ready for supermarket sweep tonight you must have left the room because we had a game show tangent
not that long ago but um short answer yes but will i actually getting around to watching it
like on hulu or whatever uh to be determined if i can pull myself away from my games long enough
because i only just that just this last week finally watched the pressure lock reboot
so i'm a little slow sometimes leave me alone all right uh let's see other questions here um
no one special says uh okay it's basically halloween season that being said is there a game
that has a horror vibe be it an old resident evil or silent hill game nightmare creatures or
whatever that would be a good fit for the halloween season that you've always liked
playing right around halloween as a sort of tradition of sorts personally i've always
enjoyed playing the first three resident evil games and or nightmare creatures anyone want to
take that i mean aside from the game in my background but that hasn't really been too recent
so yeah i will probably oh go ahead um i i've just i like final home i've played that a couple
times it out um you know don't not really i will probably be exposed to plenty of debt by daylight
thanks to my husband um i'm not huge on the scary games you guys know that i mean i do like silent
hill and stuff but i probably won't do a full replay um i like to use the halloween season
to celebrate campy horror movies um so i will probably watch the adams family uh elvira mistress
of the dark is a must this time of year uh showgirls is uh one that uh i wish jamie and i could
get together and watch uh but uh you know things are what they are but i like i like to use this
time of year to do uh scary uh horror movies not not scary but like campy i love the campy sleep
sleepaway camp um i'm trying to get other stuff that's like super camp that's yeah anyway uh
let's see other comments in chats um act f says what is a game that you've played where you've
liked most if not every single main or secondary character in it what is a game where you liked
every single character in it um um um mass effect i mean that's kind of where my head goes um
keep in mind i hated cadent first just saying yeah but he said you could most he said most was
okay are we referring so we're referring to main characters um i actually really do enjoy a lot of
the resident evil characters um i enjoy uh i mean certainly most of the final fantasy characters i
really enjoyed them i would say fantasy 13 and even with hope and venille you grow to really
like them towards the end um and especially in uh 13 2 i think hope is uh really cool so um i think
that's a good one too in my opinion and uh yeah i was thinking of this one too shane in chat gives
the answer i'm not as surprised to hear at all saying hades and yeah as far as like recent stuff
goes um all the characters in hades are so dreamy there's something about that game
there's something about that game so good uh loki anything for you where you enjoyed all
um say like final fantasy 6 or that's a good one um maybe like one of the grand theft auto
games i can't see four because roman was a pain in the ass um maybe five
um you know on twitter when people say um i'm h word on maine they mean hades all right uh
let's see moving on to one more question here that is um oh i thought we had another one nope i think
i got everything if you if we didn't get your question just repost it okay uh because i missed
it but now i will read the spam email but i'm gonna omit the name of the company because i'm
not giving them a free ad because that would just encourage them to spam me again so here we go
spam spam emails over happy music all right oh right shouldn't we all right hello how's it going
fine thank you hope all is well i have some cool information that might interest you
your podcast orange lounge radio has good performance in some rankings last 30 days

final oh wait i have to get the usuals pitch that i always do uh if you enjoyed what you heard here
at orange launch radio tell a friend help us spread the word because we are the show where
every gamer has a voice but we need the voices here in order to put them on air a nice five-star
review on a place like itunes especially if you're in mexico might help us boost our ranking and help
us uh do better on those types of things no in all seriousness though uh word of mouth goes a long
way auto hosts on twitch go a really really long way for both bobby and us here and other vog
network shows uh over at twitch.tv we really appreciate the auto host so that's uh that's
awesome so uh okay now dark soccer i'm sorry you can uh give us your final thought

but i'll say it again vote um have your plan to vote that's very important we're hearing that in
a lot of places especially um you know certain types of like low income and other types of
neighborhoods they are making the weights longer by having less machines or less places to be able
to drop off your ballot or vote so please very important have a plan to vote um if you're waiting
until the day of to vote you might have a very long wait so please have your plan ready you
should have your plan like now so if you don't have one yet get on it if i may say i'm no less
proud of people who have been enduring the lines so oh oh for sure if that if that is your plan
to endure the line fucking fantastic just make sure you have a plan that's all yeah may i have
one more little thing to that rob i guess for people who want to volunteer to help those standing
in line there are groups out there who are working on bringing uh snacks and drinks to those who have
been waiting in line for hours well that's a good idea if i find the information i'll repost it again

influenced all these years later on politics right dark sakura right all right uh last but
