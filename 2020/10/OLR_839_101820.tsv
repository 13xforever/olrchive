292360	296440	on in the gaming world and we have a lot of news we can talk about we will get into that later but
296440	302920	you know um there's a lot going on in the world right now right with uh the pandemic covid 19
302920	308360	and you know the fact that we are staying a lot more at home we're not getting out in a lot of
308360	313080	social settings as much as we used to the fact of the matter is that is starting to take its toll
313080	316760	on some of our mental health right that's no secret I'm sure a lot of us are dealing with
316760	322360	that sort of situation well now you E you kind of are interesting because you you kind of have
322360	328840	some real estate in this intersection between mental health awareness and video games right
328840	333560	so tell us a little bit about some of your projects that you work with okay so right now
333560	339720	my main thing that I'm working on is I have my own podcast called am I mental uh we are a live
339720	346120	podcast um that goes every Thursday at six um and we go through Sprecher so we actually have a chat
346120	351080	room so we can actually interact with our listeners right then in there nice and we do you know and
351160	355720	it's a it's a weekly podcast where people talk about their issues dealing with mental health
356280	359400	and each week's a different story from a different person as a matter of fact
359960	365400	your very own Jamie here is going to be a guest on my podcast uh not this Thursday but the Thursday
365400	371480	after okay uh great and I and as far as gaming goes I mean I've been a gamer since the old Atari
371480	378520	2600 so yeah yeah and definitely um I'm in a lot of different little groups right now um the big
378520	385720	thing right now that we've been playing is a lot of among us um it's highly social very fun at
385720	392920	brain exercises and we actually I have a group chat that I put together uh I didn't put together
392920	397160	myself but I've been adding to it a lot but we have a group chat where it's just for among us
397880	402920	we don't talk politics we don't talk pandemics we just share memes and play among us and other
402920	409560	games and it's been really helpful you know especially I mean me myself right now I'm a
409560	415560	stay-at-home dad you know I've been unemployed for over a year now and my podcast has been going
415560	421560	since March so we're coming up on our one year anniversary you know in a few more months um
422120	425880	but that's all I really have going on that you know taking care of the kids making sure my
425880	431560	daughter gets her schoolwork done on time and all that jazz and also being in California with all
431560	437240	the smoke that's been in the air you know it just it really weighs down on someone well now being a
437240	442840	full-time parent is no short career so especially in this day and age where all the kids are going
442840	448680	to school virtually and stuff so I I'm sure you keep very busy between that and your different
448680	453240	projects as well um I think I remember you mentioning that you also had like a Facebook
453240	458680	group that was kind of at this intersection of mental health and video games yeah there's a group
458680	463960	that I got brought into by another by one of our listeners actually it's uh called Just Pause
464760	472520	um and it's just for gamers with mental health issues and discussing you know challenges and
472520	477400	helping each other brainstorm solutions like hey you know it sounds like maybe you have seasonal
477400	482200	affective disorder like like I do you know maybe when the sun comes out go take a walk you know and
482200	486040	even if you don't want to it will help you know things like that you know we're all trying to help
486040	490680	each other out and we're also sharing game reviews about what's coming up and all that too
491640	494920	um let me ask you some questions kind of diving into this topic about like
494920	500040	like video games and mental health well first like generally you know obviously this pandemic
500040	504040	was something that you know in the beginning I think some of us thought oh it'll be a couple
504040	508440	weeks and then they'll they'll you know figure out how to get it out of the U.S. and it'll be gone
508440	512920	it'll be a done deal and here we are going on month number I lost count I think we're on like
512920	519400	month seven of this whole thing going on and it still doesn't yeah now it's just kind of one of
519400	524520	those well we're just hedging our bets hoping a vaccine will be here real soon so I mean this is
524520	530120	continuing to go on and on and on so what are some ways let's talk like generally speaking that that
530120	534360	like people listening to this show what are some ways that people can like help their mental health
534360	541000	and make sure that they're not like spiraling I guess for lack of a better word because of
541000	545560	everything that's going on in the world well one of the biggest things then it's a it's a
545560	552120	reoccurring theme on the show like every week it pops up almost almost every week is that you know
552120	558520	you are not alone that even if you feel that you're going to inconvenience someone by reaching out
558520	564600	reach out you're not inconveniencing anyone the real problem with depression is that it gives you
564600	573000	a lesser self-image and it causes you to basically maximize and minimize things it maximizes
573000	578040	you maximize and build mountains out of other people's everything and you minimize and flatten
578040	584920	out everything that is you a great example is like you're in group therapy if you ever have to
584920	588840	go to group therapy or if you've ever gone you're going to sit around and if you're depressed you're
588840	591480	going to hear all these people telling their stories and you're going to think wow every
591480	596040	single person has it worse than me and you're going to feel like an imposter then when it's
596040	599000	your turn to share and you share you're going to look around and see everybody's looking at you
599000	605800	going wow that person has it really bad I'm an imposter so it's really important to just reach
605800	613320	out you know people care even if you think they don't they do as a matter of fact two episodes
613320	619560	ago was really really heavily about that we actually had someone who did a ted talk who
620520	623800	they had a student commit suicide when they were their first year teaching
624360	628680	two years later they had another one attempt suicide she found out about it wrote a letter
628680	633320	to that student that student started crying going i didn't know anybody cared so she she sat down
633320	639240	for two months and wrote 130 handwritten letters took a picture of it put it up on facebook sharing
639240	642920	this is what i'm doing she didn't think it was anything special it's just this is what i have to
642920	648840	do two days later she's getting calls from bbc she's getting calls from good morning america
648840	654280	washington post new york times usa today everybody wants her on the show or wants an interview for
654280	660200	their news articles wow and it all boils down to the same thing you always feel like you're
660200	665480	less than you actually are just reach out it's interesting you kind of bring up that feeling
665480	669720	of being an imposter because lord knows i have felt that imposter syndrome right it's kind of
669720	675160	like another way of framing it i have felt that i can't tell you how many times doing some of these
675160	681560	things i've been able to do because of the success i guess of this podcast things like being a guest
681560	687800	on dragon con panels and getting to sometimes moderate these celebrity panels i have absolutely
687800	695080	had those moments of oh my god at some point these folks are gonna find out i am not ninja i am not
695080	699400	you know one of these youtubers that have like a million views they're gonna be like what the hell
699400	704760	is this guy doing on stage get him off of there like that that imposter syndrome stuff that can
704760	709960	really mess with your head it really can oh absolutely and i bet you when you were done
709960	715400	people came up to compliment you afterwards on this job you did yes yeah not i i try to be humble
715400	720680	but yes and that that kind of helped with um you know some of those other things that i was feeling
720680	725480	is i was like oh thank gosh for that validation maybe i'll be able to sneak through and do this
725480	730920	again another year right and that's another thing that we it's really big and with our even our chat
730920	737400	group our tech group absolutely amazing some of the most fanatically loyal fans i've ever seen
737400	742600	and i mean i've done professional performances where i was performing 400 crowds of 10 000 people
742600	747960	and i've never seen this um where it comes down to it doesn't matter what your story is your story
747960	753880	is yours your struggle is yours it is valid just because you feel someone else has it worse than
753880	757560	you doesn't mean that others aren't going to look and think that you have it worse than them and
757560	766120	even that doesn't matter it's your struggle um and the validation it helps a lot to get through that
766680	773000	yeah absolutely absolutely and i think uh knowing that like your concerns in your situation is valid
773000	779160	is is huge no matter what the scope or size of it is like you know like you you mentioned before
779160	782200	when it comes to this pandemic situation everything we are all going through this
782200	786200	thing together you know so there's there's a lot of feelings that we're all feeling
787560	793720	right and as politicized as it has become let's face it a virus is not a politician a virus is a
793720	798600	virus right and it's hitting all of us right some harder than others but still in the end
798600	804840	we're all going through it absolutely jamie you were trying to add something yeah i was i was
804840	810200	saying that um earlier in the year when i was still sick with pneumonia and playing a lot of
810200	817560	animal crossing um after after the fact because i mean my my dad died um my mother-in-law died um
818120	822280	you know a lot of people were grieving and couldn't go more than their family members we
822280	826840	were talking about how people are using video games as their coping mechanism i have an entire
826840	831800	cemetery in my cute little animal crossing village and each grave there represents somebody or
831800	838840	something close to me and and my friend built like a memorial garden to her mother who died a year ago
838840	843640	in animal crossing and you know there were funerals in final fantasy 14 you know they
843640	850920	had that whole procession walk um you know and i think that i i think well and also the creators
850920	856040	in wow are really good about putting up memorials to very notable people that have been lost you
856040	862360	know and so i think that there's a major juxtaposition with those of us who work or
862360	869560	work or live in gaming culture with our different ways of dealing with our own mental health
869560	876600	that aren't necessarily something that your average psychologist say would look into although
876600	881720	there are some studies about it i'm seeing more studies on it and especially for me being um
881720	886280	neurodivergent you know my way of coping with something is going to be completely different
886280	890280	than how someone else copes with it you know i feel like an imposter every day because
891080	900200	i have to mask my different neurobiology from all humans of the earth there is a site that
900200	903880	summed up what being autistic is like for me it's called anotherplanet.org
904680	912040	because i feel like i'm from another planet sometimes and all of all of these human people are
912040	917640	are weird now i have a place to go to learn more i have to see if it's still running it's been a
917640	924280	while all right but um but yeah but all of the you know all of these aspects of how we deal with
924280	929720	everything the hobbies that we do the things that we enjoy all of that wraps into our personal
929720	936040	coping mechanisms but yeah yeah definitely um now e you can appreciate this since you were talking
936040	941240	about the among us memes earlier because of course we do tape live every sunday night on twitch so oh
941240	945320	we do have our chat room going at twitch.tv slash vog network and i am going to be a little bit
945320	948600	piggy choosy in the comments i read tonight because some people are being very transparent
948600	953080	with their mental health and i don't want to necessarily read people that are like i'm dealing
953080	956600	with this i'm dealing with that because i don't know if you really want that on the podcast um so
956600	960840	i am going to kind of refrain a little bit from reading every comment um but i think you can
960840	966520	appreciate these comments e um some people saying uh act deaf says i'm not an imposter you're all
966520	972760	sus to me dg says i think act deaf is acting hella sus bobby black hole says why did you just come
972760	981960	climb out of the vent love it i absolutely love it um yeah and act deaf reminded me that that's a
981960	990600	a tumblr account so it probably still is up nice yeah um yeah i'm not that's chatted off um when i
990600	995160	when i'm running my podcast i have the co-host doing most of the reading of the chat room and
995160	999080	moderating but i'll still read it because i mean we don't have a ton of people in there it's easy
999080	1005160	enough to keep up with but it's i have to pay more attention to the guest and try to pay less
1005160	1011080	attention to the chat yeah we we've gotten crazy multitasking skills over the 18 years doing this
1011080	1016040	show so that has been an integral part of the show since we started if i take a weird angle it's
1016040	1020200	probably because i'm looking over at the chat room because i'm i'm situated weird for the four shot
1020200	1027080	tonight that's all right and i'm usually doing the in-person typing chat so yeah nice yeah it's
1027080	1033080	like when we do our show um we do video between each other but only for each other it's only audio
1033080	1038120	otherwise um and like the guests and the co-host will see me all of a sudden just like get this
1038120	1044600	grin and thank goodness for my 26 years of uh phone support and it experienced where i don't
1044600	1050440	just burst out laughing i've come close with some of the comments in chat like someone's talking
1050440	1055560	about you know i lost my mom i've had this big drinking problem and then something funny pops
1055560	1063480	up in chat i'm like trying so hard not to laugh i bet i bet because that's part of it is the live
1063480	1068760	aspect of it so it's been kind of fun oh yeah i love the live aspect of it getting back to the
1068760	1073240	mental health and using video games to kind of deal with that you know um dark sakura brought
1073240	1079240	up uh that she had the memorials um that she had in her animal crossing game and uh interestingly
1079240	1084520	enough that is also something i ended up doing you know i lost my mom in 2017 and that you know
1084520	1090360	that's not something you really ever get over and when there was the mom character in animal
1090360	1095720	crossing that started sending all the gifts i kind of felt like i needed a place to put those gifts
1095720	1102600	so i set up a memorial kind of as well so i'm kind of like animal crossing is a very interesting
1102600	1108040	sort of game and i'm not sure how well versed you are in animal crossing but you know it's it's
1108040	1112520	interesting because of the fact that it came out right when this pandemic happened that you have
1112520	1118760	so many people that have been using this game to kind of deal with what's going on i i i don't know
1118760	1122760	e i saw kind of shaking your head maybe it's not a game you're really playing but have you heard
1122760	1127400	much about how people are using this to cope or oh yeah i've heard a lot about how people are using
1127400	1133640	it to cope um i don't have a switch i i just have my phone and i have a mac so i sure and the mobile
1133640	1141240	version of animal crossing no not the same no i gave up on that yeah it's like it's not that i
1141240	1146600	don't want to i just don't have the means right now to to play it um but i've seen the uh of
1146600	1150760	course i watched some video play of it and all that it looks like a great game but yeah uh the
1150760	1155240	ability to go ahead and do that a little bit of free world crafting and being able to do those
1155240	1161800	memorials i've seen a lot of people talking about how for them that's what helped them with the
1161800	1169160	whole grieving process and um grieving comes up a lot on our show and do you mind if i plug a book
1169160	1173240	it's not mine no go ahead but it's a great one it's called the grief recovery handbook
1174120	1178280	that one has helped me we talk a lot of we talk about we plug a lot of video games that aren't
1178280	1185320	ours so a book is okay too no fair enough but yeah the grief recovery handbook it changed my life
1185960	1190200	it helped me find methods and avenues of grieving that were much more healthy
1190200	1196200	than just sitting and dwelling and hoping it goes away it doesn't you you have to do something
1197080	1201640	and that's where like the angle crossing stuff really helps if i may also throw this in there's
1201640	1209720	a good ted talk and i think it's by brené brown about uh um closure and how it's truly not a
1210360	1215880	healthy concept that there's never closure you can never separate yourself from your grief or
1215880	1219720	your death because you also separate yourself from the good memories that come with it as well
1220680	1226040	you know there's there's no moving on there's an american culture in general has separated itself
1226600	1232600	from death and grieving that you know we used to host you know the bodies in our homes
1233320	1237720	families would wash them prior to you know that we've separated ourselves so much from that
1237720	1244280	process that i think that that's part of why we have trouble grieving anyway but and so
1244280	1248920	for us to be able to bring that aspect back into our lives even in a virtual environment you know
1248920	1255160	in animal crossing we have a grave in the town that is supposed to be our virtual home you know
1255800	1262520	and it's there and you can visit it and you can see it it's not removed out in another town that
1262520	1268920	you have to drive to go oh i gotta go to the you know cemetery me i used to have picnics in
1268920	1274760	cemeteries when i lived in alabama um i used to go i used to take my cousins out snipe hunting
1277880	1284520	but but anyway it's i feel like our video games like this and this like this new grieving
1284520	1288840	process that's sort of reincorporating something that we've lost as a culture
1289480	1294760	back into our our daily lives we may not have a corpse in our house i mean
1295960	1304360	but we have like that memento mori exactly our own reminder of our own mortality as we remember
1304360	1309320	those who have left us and it's it's it's interesting you do to kind of talk about
1309320	1313640	like the grieving process and how video games might be kind of one way to deal with that
1313640	1318200	and i don't think necessarily grieving has to necessarily be just about over the loss of life
1318200	1322600	you know everything has really changed because of this pandemic some people are grieving
1322600	1329000	the loss of a job that people are grieving you know the loss of a routine the loss of maybe you
1329000	1336440	used to go to a rave every saturday night and say what you will about raves but you know that that's
1336440	1342360	church for some people it is a huge social thing and people are very likely grieving the loss of
1342360	1347720	that as well so i i've kind of always said since the beginning of this i said this whole situation
1347720	1353640	is crap this covid thing is crap the pandemic is crap but the art that's going to come from
1353640	1360280	the after this year is going to be amazing and i think video you know and if we subscribe to the
1361480	1367560	thought process that video games are art which i do um that's just one big part of it but the
1367560	1373560	grieving for some people can be making a podcast making a twitch stream or a youtube which i've
1373560	1378760	always been a big proponent proponent about trying to get people to do that but i started a new
1378760	1382840	project which i'll plug later yeah and you know and there's all sorts of those types of projects
1382840	1388520	but it could also be like i'm taking up a cross stitch thing i've always wanted to do and i never
1388520	1394440	got around to doing or making masks can be a thing for people too like we were you know doing that
1394440	1399320	round table a couple weeks ago with the cosplayers talking about that how you know there's no
1399320	1404040	conventions right now but you can still kind of get your arts and crafts in from doing masks
1404040	1409000	so i was doing project one way for me was it was kind of like bringing my cosplay back
1409880	1415880	right right um and bobby is saying i used to go to a bar trivia every other thursday night with
1415880	1420360	my friends since i worked from home before all this that would sometimes be literally the only
1420360	1425640	time i left the house right so say what you will about zoom trivia and the the replacements which
1425640	1432120	is great it's nice that we have those things but you know it's not the same it's really not yeah
1432120	1438600	yeah and it's just you don't get that someone accidentally bump into you sorry sorry or you
1438600	1443080	know meet some random person and strike up a conversation and wind up with a good friend you
1443080	1447480	just just doesn't happen as often when it's virtual i mean i'm not saying it doesn't happen
1447560	1453320	it just doesn't happen as often well and with me being one of the sisters our entire aspects of
1453320	1459320	ministry have changed i think i was a much better adapted to online ministry than some of the older
1459320	1465640	sisters i am the youngest one in our group you know we have some you know we used to have a
1465640	1474840	retiree in that was our abbess um and so um for a group that's so social that would go out to do
1474840	1480280	bar ministry and have in-person events i've had to sort of be the reminding factor y'all need to
1480280	1486680	wear your masks when we're out in public i i had to distance myself i'm like you can do all of
1486680	1493160	this online our meetings are online everything is and i think that that though i'm hoping that
1493160	1502200	that's bringing older generations into a more modern concept so that maybe these techniques
1502200	1509880	that we are developing those of us who are gen x and younger are able to teach them these same
1509880	1517960	concepts teach them that there is a new way to express what they're feeling or to live to be
1517960	1524440	social that you don't have to sit at a table across from someone drinking with them to still
1524440	1530520	enjoy someone's company exactly and for a lot of people who are just really big extroverts
1531080	1534360	i think this is a powerful lesson in people learning how to be alone
1536040	1542760	yeah yeah that's learn how to enjoy your own company i'm a big extrovert you know it's no
1542760	1548840	secret i was hosting shows hosting you know this right now i i i should have hosted a rocky horror
1548840	1553640	last night you know like that with 500 people over at the colonial it was great when it all began
1553640	1560200	yeah but uh that's cute uh but you know that's not happening and so it's it's it's it's been hard
1560200	1564920	i'm not gonna lie you know like yeah i am that extrovert that a lot of the introverts are talking
1564920	1572440	about and it's it's it's been tricky in its own way so yeah um let me ask this not not to be in
1572440	1579320	a negative place but i would be remiss not to ask are there ways that video games in this whole
1579320	1585800	situation could be bad for your mental health what are some things as gamers we should avoid
1586760	1591560	absolutely sometimes the escapism or whatever if that's what you want to call it i'm not
1591560	1597080	sure what the exact term is but you can definitely overdo it to the point where you're neglecting
1597640	1601320	your physical health you're neglecting your hygiene you're neglecting your diet
1601880	1605080	if you have family you're neglecting your family you're neglecting your pets
1606760	1613720	absolutely trash your sleep cycle sleep hygiene is very important for mental function
1613800	1617640	you know getting the right amount of sleep during the right times for whatever your sleep cycle
1617640	1626280	happens to be uh is really critical um i've been known to go ahead and just binge on a game when
1626280	1632120	i'm unsupervised even now i'm 43 years old the wife takes the kids out i will get on and i'll
1632120	1639880	play a game start at in the morning and go until sunrise the next day you know and it it trashes my
1639880	1645080	mental health you know i feel like i'm having a good time i feel like i'm having fun but it's a
1645080	1651960	short-term game long-term loss for me you know because i i could have gone outside taking a walk
1651960	1656920	which would have been much more beneficial you know for me i have to really moderate how much
1656920	1663000	i play and what i play because there are some games that i have associated with very bad periods
1663000	1669080	of my life that i just need to avoid as good as the games are i just i can't play them for my own
1669080	1676680	mental health i hope that answers no for sure for sure and you know i've seen my mass effect binges
1677320	1685400	i i've you know i i think because i i i'm very lucky in that i really enjoy my job and i like
1685400	1691240	what i do and i do have the ability throughout all this to be able to work from home and i recognize
1691240	1697480	i'm very lucky in all those aspects so but i think that helps keep my sleep schedule on track because
1697480	1703800	if i didn't have my job to worry about i think i would probably very easily fall into this pattern
1703800	1708840	of you know i can stay up till 3 a.m doing mining and crafting and final fantasy because nobody's
1708840	1713800	going to bother me it'd be very easy to fall into that even before the pandemic we would hear those
1713800	1719560	stories about oh the guy at the cyber cafe in korea that spent 24 hours straight playing league
1719560	1725640	of legends that just collapsed you know or um you know the the person that played wow all weekend
1725640	1730520	long and ended up you know having a severe medical issue because this is how these are the
1730520	1734120	types of things that can lead to issues like strokes and things that if you don't get up and
1734120	1740280	move around that's very serious you have to that's one reason you know i like my watch not to give
1740280	1746440	these guys a free ad and to do to be fair all the please give them a free ad all the modern to be
1746440	1751880	fair all the modern fitness watches do it so i'm gonna leave it at that but they they will poke you
1751880	1758200	every hour and go hey hey fatty get up get up get up off your ass and so when people go why
1758200	1763320	did you spend all that money on a watch i kind of go you know what like even though it like sounds
1763320	1769160	small those things are a huge deal later on and you know and for our listeners out there because
1769160	1772920	i'm sure we have several listeners that are like i i don't have a fancy fitness watch and that's
1772920	1779320	not happening for me that's so you don't need one you can set a timer on your computer or a timer on
1779320	1785800	your casio old school calculator watch that goes off every 59 minutes that does the same type of
1785800	1789880	thing you know that reminds you to get up and move around you can get these little cheapo things on
1789880	1794520	wish for three bucks now and they do the same thing exactly so there's there's plenty of other
1794520	1800200	solutions besides the fancy fruit stuff and you know all that so and you just always say to your
1800200	1809000	phone hey phone set timer four yes yes so yeah very very important stuff um so um yeah and i'm
1809480	1813320	looking in chat and again i want to be careful what i read tonight because i think people are
1813320	1817400	saying some very vulnerable things i don't necessarily want to put that out there um but
1817400	1821240	i see some people talking about their sleep schedules are not in a great place right now
1821240	1827000	uh one listener is talking about going to bed at 1am and then waking up at 8am now it's 10pm and
1827000	1832360	waking up at 4am which seems seems to be a little more you know but yeah i mean that that sleep
1832360	1837640	schedule is is crazy the other thing with my work and i think this is very important is that
1837640	1843480	i have found and i need to be better about this i need to do because this was this was something
1843480	1849800	when i thought it was just going to be a two-week solution my workplace and my pc gaming place are
1849800	1857080	the exact same place and i think that's that's very bad it is no it's very bad and that's why
1857080	1861320	like and you know it's interesting because i've also been asked why why why are you buying new
1861320	1868760	consoles when you have a pc and in my opinion this is just exacerbating like this is why i
1868760	1873560	need to have a different space to play games sometimes that isn't in front of the bc which is
1873560	1878120	what i'm doing all day for work you know and even when it is going back to the office sometimes
1878120	1883080	instead of sitting in my ergonomically sound chair i want to be a potato on the couch and
1883080	1888600	play some no man's sky and just changing up those types of factors is really healthy because again
1888600	1892920	i'm admitting and you're all agreeing what i'm doing right now is bad like pc gaming and working
1892920	1897640	in the same place is bad but unfortunately it's kind of my only choice right now until we do some
1897640	1904760	major rearranging i have two separate computers though side by side i've got my my uh my work max
1904760	1910920	and then i have my pc which is gonna be going away soon but i have another mac over there
1911720	1916680	that's my other workstation for doing my own creative work one thing i did when i was in
1916680	1922600	that situation where i had my gaming pc and my work pc side by side is i made sure my gaming pc
1922600	1928920	was off while i was working and i had a specific work chair when i was done with work i turned off
1928920	1934840	the work computer switched chairs something whether it's a physical change of location
1934840	1941480	or some psychological change really helps to help keep it separated um because one of the dangers of
1941480	1946760	working from home is to fall into the routine of oh well i have five minutes i could go move the
1946760	1951320	laundry you really shouldn't you really should try to keep guilty effort for your life i know
1951320	1957720	so am i but you should really try to keep those aspects separated for your own health now see for
1957720	1968680	me i need those moments because of um my chronic fatigue if i am doing nothing but focusing on my
1968680	1975240	work computer and i work a 10-hour day with an hour lunch so i can get three days off in a row
1975240	1981480	um but anyway for me i need those moments i actually have a medical reason that i get three
1981480	1987960	extra breaks in my shift and i get up and leave i used to have a bad habit of staying at my desk
1987960	1995880	and doing like my email or stuff during my lunch i need those separate moments where i am not in
1995880	2003960	work mode i am real life mode and for me being home to do that instead of going like say to the
2003960	2008600	cafe to get you know a snack or a coffee or something i'm still in the building and still
2008600	2016360	seeing for lack of a better description the work propaganda yeah whereas if i leave this room i get
2016360	2022920	me out by my cat and she's a lot nicer yeah and what i'm saying though is it's more the general
2022920	2029240	rule not the hard yeah everybody right um i mean when i have my switch next to me everybody's
2029240	2032920	going to be different everybody's going to be different yeah yeah like for me because i mean
2032920	2038200	i used to work the same company that jamie did um and she remembers i was a wanderer on my breaks
2038200	2043960	at lunchtime yes i went around and i made i visited as many people as i could it's just part
2043960	2048440	of who i am um and i was always trying to help people out give little tips of advice to try to
2048440	2053880	pick up some of my own but you don't do what frank does he puts on that wireless headset
2053880	2061000	and walks down the aisle while he's doing his thing yeah um and by the way rob drew works with
2061000	2067240	us too no i know i know yeah so but when i got to move from home or got to move to home i actually
2067240	2072520	have a detached office which right now my son's living in but he's moving out on this coming up
2072520	2080120	friday and i get to have that back as my sound studio hardwired internet to it um what i would
2080120	2087240	do is between calls is i have my door open and i play fetch with my dog i like that i like that
2087240	2092360	idea too of just changing something like your chair like if it isn't it possible for you to
2092360	2097960	change the entire environment just change you know your chair change maybe something that is
2097960	2102040	surrounding maybe you have a a digital picture frame and the pictures show different when you're
2102040	2106200	working versus when you're not i mean it sounds silly but or maybe the curtain is closed when
2106200	2109400	you're working but then it's open when you're not you know just like those little changes to your
2109400	2115720	environment can be huge even like a little dummy light switch that you drill into your desk well
2115720	2120440	and i'm sure you guys can see that i have this like roller cart behind me loaded with toys
2120440	2127000	yeah it is actually a barrier between now i have it at an angle i can still kind of see across
2127000	2134440	but it's still technically my barrier for where my work situation is so and i have completely
2134440	2141480	different toys facing the other direction so i kind of like can build my own cubicle wall for
2141480	2146920	and this whole room is going to get redone so i'm actually going to be picking myself up a uh
2148040	2154040	a green screen and a blue screen so that i can have that as an actual for real physical divider
2154040	2160920	neat okay yeah um and if you guys in chat have any questions for um e please go ahead and uh
2160920	2166600	let them uh out in our chat room over twitch.tv slash avog network uh and again e is the host of
2166600	2175560	the podcast am i mental that is a very hard name to forget yes i'm kidding well i i bet for a lot
2175560	2180280	of people it might be i mean again we're not a doctor and if you think you you maybe you
2180360	2185160	probably should always get assessed by a doctor but we're one gestalt doctor i bet i bet the
2185160	2189640	answer to am i mental is uh maybe a little bit but probably not as bad as you think
2190360	2197000	for a lot of people i i like to quote the mad hatter here we're all mad here i'm mad you're mad
2198200	2203880	my whole thing was is that when you start to wrestle with the fact that you might have uh
2203880	2209480	some kind of mental illness or mental health issue uh a question usually does pop up along the lines
2209480	2215800	of am i crazy is it me is there something wrong with me am i mental and i figured that was kind
2215800	2222200	of a catchy name and it stuck and it really has a lot of meaning because i those questions um and
2222200	2226520	we actually do have an official website am i mental dot net dot com was taken by somebody
2226520	2234120	else i had to take net but um yeah and um no we're actually at the process right now we're going
2234120	2238600	through our third season uh we only do two episodes ten episode seasons we're trying to
2238600	2244440	match the seasons of the year so each season is a different actual season like we're in the fall
2244440	2250680	season right now then the next one will be the winter season um but we're already booking up
2250680	2256360	for season four already and we are only three episodes in on season three so it feels really
2256360	2262280	good like um just gotta give you an idea of how it's growing my first season unfortunately i
2262280	2267560	started on march 19th first day of spring which it just happened to land that way i didn't even
2267560	2271640	know was the first day of spring it's like three days before the episode and then went yeah let's
2271640	2276920	just follow the seasons that's kind of how it came through but it took me two months to get it all
2276920	2281400	booked out and then covet hit and essential workers wound up working you know like six
2281400	2287800	12-hour shifts and i had the entire season it was just rescheduling rescheduling rescheduling
2288440	2292760	season two took a month to get scheduled season three it was done in under 12 hours
2293720	2300520	what do you get in your system plans to to take the time off to be on for was it the 29th
2300520	2308920	yeah yes you have the basically the halloween episode and no one is surprised yeah and i was
2308920	2313960	like i laughed about it too because like i did the music for your 666 episode and you're coming
2313960	2319720	over for my first halloween episode yeah kismet perfect well you know what with you having done
2319720	2325400	our music for that episode funny thing is that i made our podcast theme for this one
2326680	2333960	oh for our new podcast name i did it myself very cool yeah with a little help yeah i mean
2335320	2339960	that part of where you work it starts coming naturally after a little while you just kind
2339960	2343800	of poking around and playing with things well and you know who it is jamal helped me
2344520	2349800	oh yeah jamal's awesome yeah let me let me get y'all talking about people that our listeners
2349800	2354280	don't know so let me get back to this question in chat no no it's fine it's fine um some good
2354280	2359080	you know tips and and lessons learned from some of our chatters here uh shmaketastic in chat over
2359080	2364440	twitch.tv slash vlog network says i've made the mistake of having my work desk next to my gaming
2364440	2370600	desk and using the same chair i feel as if i'm associating the work stress with gaming
2370600	2377640	and stressfully gaming sometimes like being unable to let gaming relax me sometimes and that's that's
2377640	2383320	big that's really talking about like you know the the the being able to have like the separate
2383320	2390040	spaces you can separate those things in your mind mentally yeah um one of the coolest little stories
2390040	2395560	i ever heard this was back i was in seventh grade my english teacher was talking about how this guy
2396440	2402120	every day after work he'd get home and he would touch one specific branch on the tree as he came
2402120	2406280	to onto his property and went into the house and then every day on his way to work he touched that
2406280	2411480	same branch and leave and he did this for over a year his wife finally asked what are you doing
2411480	2417560	and he says when i get home from work i'm hanging up all of my work stresses on that tree
2418520	2422120	and then when i leave to go back to work i'm picking them up again and noticing they're a
2422120	2427320	lot lighter than they were when i put them there i like that it's a good story i thought that was
2427320	2433400	a cool little story i like that um ssj100 mat and chat says i've been making sure to go outside
2433400	2438840	mostly late at night or early morning when there's fewer folks to get my outside time because that is
2438840	2444520	also important being in a two-room studio for now feels claustrophobic thankfully i'm moving in a
2444520	2449320	week you know that importance of getting outside and moving around is so important and luckily
2449320	2454520	you know a lot of that is gamified uh you know obviously pokemon go is the huge behemoth that
2454520	2458600	a lot of people talking about for motivation to go outside but there's other games as well you know
2458600	2465400	loki has talked a lot about orna the you know kind of rpg inspired one that is when you can uh play
2465400	2470680	out while you walk as well minecraft earth uh there's a jurassic world one the list goes on
2470680	2475560	and on chances are one of those games is something that could incentivize you going outdoors if you
2475560	2483480	need it absolutely and i mean um what's kind of funny is that i'm seeing a lot of especially now
2483480	2488040	with the mobile gaming community the way that it is a little bit of a tangent here is that the
2488040	2495640	aims range is spectacular on the people that you interact with but nobody's judging on age at all
2496280	2500280	you know because we're all just trying to get away trying to have a little bit of fun
2500280	2506680	yeah um as it should be yeah and it's like i'm 43 years old and i run a guild and a game called
2506680	2512040	shop titans uh basically it's like you're the instead of being the you know you go to the shop
2512040	2517000	in a role-playing game to sell all your junk and buy new stuff you're the shopkeeper and the
2517000	2522440	players the npcs are the adventurers i play there's like a shop girl game yeah i played a game like
2522440	2526840	that on steam but it wasn't like an mo it was like a racketeer something was the name of that
2526840	2532520	game i somebody in chattel here right is that it somebody in chattel no yeah there was a game like
2532520	2537400	that i was playing on steam yeah at this one um one of our most active members is a retiree
2538040	2543720	you know and um in my group on among us they keep calling me og because i've been playing
2543720	2549000	since the atara 2600 you know and some of these people are like i never even heard of that system
2549000	2554280	before they had to look it up oh wow oh wow yeah yeah doesn't that make you feel old yeah a little
2554280	2558520	bit that's interesting because among us and you you keep coming back to that game and obviously
2558520	2564760	that is the a huge uh a game right now it's it's in the top all the time on twitch and so forth
2564760	2569240	but i also think that game that game is some i don't know if i want to say mental warfare
2569800	2574840	but it can be some serious like mental gymnastics because you essentially are having to lie to
2574840	2581320	people sometimes and that's really uncomfortable so how does that work with the mental health
2582840	2585720	a lot of people in my group when they're the imposter they just help themselves right away
2585720	2590840	because they can't do it they don't want to do it but they really enjoy the mind play of trying to
2590840	2597080	figure out who the imposter is i like being the imposter i love being the imposter um i my
2597080	2602280	favorite is when there's two imposters if i'm the first one to die the other imposter never has to
2602280	2607000	worry about sabotage again so they can keep moving constantly and no one goes i saw them
2607000	2612920	stop just before this yeah nope they didn't stop because i'm helping them but yeah no it takes
2612920	2617880	some teamwork makes the dream work yep but it does it takes a mentality to be able to be the
2617880	2624840	the imposter and be able to fly but i mean for me i'm not lying to them for the because i'm trying
2624840	2630440	to get away with actual murder or actual crimes sure it's just all fun and games it's role playing
2630440	2634200	for me and i play dungeons and dragons and i played star wars i play a lot of role-playing
2634200	2638840	games so it's just role play for me sure it's like the old werewolf game we used to play on
2638840	2647720	ddr forums yeah and uh and uh the werewolf is a the game that is infamous at dragon con you know
2647720	2653800	and those those types of things so yeah it's to me among us is just an evolution of that mafia slash
2653800	2658760	who's the werewolf type of game it's it's just somebody thought how to put that in a digital
2658760	2663400	format in a platforming type of way and they did an amazing job with it and it's interesting
2663400	2668440	because it it sat for two years before it got discovered which really makes that game really
2668440	2674120	fascinating and how it works so yeah i mean it's just like that whole town of salem whatever
2674120	2678680	except that instead of it being you have your discussion cycle okay now it's the night cycle
2678680	2685160	do your thing you're actually running around physically doing things on the game and if you're
2685160	2689000	the imposter you're trying to fake doing these things without getting caught faking you're
2689000	2694120	trying to find opportunities that you can off someone and you're trying to set up sabotages
2694120	2700200	and clever ways to help get people separated from the herd you know and it's and there's also a lot
2700200	2705800	of the mental play too where as the imposter you don't want the finger pointed at you obviously
2705800	2708920	and you want to try to make sure that you get the finger pointed elsewhere if someone starts to
2708920	2713720	suspect you well and you know you know what's also interesting and i think that works with among us
2713720	2719480	is that it also works i think because the games are so short and you can play like 15 games of
2719480	2725000	it a night because i'll tell you uh i i am into those types of psychological games like survivor
2725000	2731560	on tv and um uh like big brother and stuff like that well before it got super racist but the game
2731560	2737720	itself i find very fascinating um but survivor i've played versions of survivor online that are
2737720	2742360	very intense they go on for a month and you're sitting at home but you're still on skype a lot
2742360	2745960	of the time or discord or whatever it is with you know your tribe mates and the people you're
2745960	2750760	working with like to the point where you know i i won i was i was lucky enough to win one last
2750760	2756360	summer but like i remember i had to vote out my closest ally at final four because if he didn't
2756360	2762120	get voted out he was going to win and if i want to win he's got to go but i cried i because i was
2762120	2767480	just so invested and like you know i definitely learned like oh my gosh to play a game like this
2767480	2773000	i have got to have the mental energy to do it and i don't i haven't played one since i've been
2773000	2779080	asked to play like four or five different games and i i just i also kind of recognize like i need
2779080	2785080	a mental reserve battery i don't have right now and i thought the pandemic was going to give me
2785080	2790440	the time but i don't think it's given me that mental reserve battery by any means and that's
2790440	2795800	why i've passed up so many opportunities to play during what i think is a really great time to play
2796760	2803480	right yeah it's like i mean um even with my podcast like i have a daughter she's an adult now
2803480	2811160	uh going to uh she's going to a jc at this moment um she wanted to do psychology major she's changed
2811160	2816520	it now but even she has said because of the pandemic she can't listen to most of the episodes
2816520	2823480	of my podcast because she just doesn't have that reserve you know the pandemic is draining it you
2823480	2828600	know because she used to go out on every saturday it was go out to a restaurant have something to
2828600	2834040	eat with your group of friends and then go play board games that's just gone yeah you know for
2834040	2838120	real and that recharged her batteries to allow her to be able to enjoy you know my podcast she's only
2838120	2842680	listened to a couple episodes and you know she feels so bad about it you know she's like i'm so
2842680	2848040	sorry i'm so sorry i'm like honey it's fine i get it this is not a podcast for everybody in all
2848040	2852920	situations some of my closest friends will hear the topic of an episode and they're like i'm gone
2852920	2858840	can't deal with this one no yeah yeah and that's yeah i get that and i haven't hit an episode yet
2858840	2864440	as a host where i'm going no but if it happens it happens and i'm gonna either have to power through
2864440	2869240	it i'm gonna have to ask the co-host hey this one's too personal can you take it yeah you know
2869240	2875080	and i get it yeah and i don't require my friends to listen to this show i really it's it's a lie
2875080	2879640	and it's not video games like the the deep discussion we do on some of this stuff is not

3168040	3173560	about our gaming weeks so dark sakura we'll start with you how was your gaming week it was animal
3173560	3181000	crossing um i had i would be shocked if it wasn't i have hades i haven't had a chance to play it yet
3181800	3189800	um i did play a little bit more ppl um i it's just with project nun way i haven't really had
3189800	3196760	a super lot of time but we did get a new pinball um we now have the uh jersey jack pirates of the
3196760	3205560	caribbean we have sold off quite a few pinball to be able to uh afford it um we have sold indiana
3205560	3213240	jones um we have sold uh no we didn't sell shadow we sold um star trek the next generation we had
3213240	3220440	the old valley star trek that we sold a few others um so uh it's it's pretty crazy it's one of those
3220440	3225400	ones that's got the big screen with the full video on it rob one of this that's what the jersey jack
3225400	3233240	ones are like like uh the wizard of oz so um so yeah it's it's pretty crazy i haven't really
3233240	3239080	i played it in the past at other people's houses so this is uh a little bit you know of a thing
3239640	3249320	um and i have other gaming ish things going on but i won't talk about that yet i'll wait until
3249320	3254920	gaming week is over if you don't mind okay sure you got it yeah uh doctor who
3254920	3261800	accord uh climb pod culture loki you're still here it's so quiet i am hope you're all right
3261800	3265560	no you're fine you're fine i know sometimes you want to let the guests talk it's fine
3266360	3270680	exactly and all i can really contribute to that is yeah i'm angry all the time because i have to do
3271240	3281320	i have to work and with people that they're people um so anyways um so this week i didn't play a
3281320	3287960	whole ton of things but i did play some new stuff so i tried out the new mario kart uh home circuit
3287960	3294360	live so i got to play that a little bit so that was cool how was that i was watching bobby play
3294440	3301160	it on stream it looked it looked neat yeah it's pretty neat um so not a lot of like space i was
3301160	3305800	hoping that it would be able to work through multiple rooms but as you probably saw in his
3305800	3314040	stream it does not handle that very well you can only go like not too far away especially if you
3314040	3319240	have a wall in between you yeah you have to line a site the switch basically which if you're willing
3319240	3323720	to play in handheld mode he brought this up on the call the bobby when we were talking at the end of
3323720	3329240	his show if you're willing to take the switch off the dock and walk behind the car you can make a
3329240	3336600	bigger course but that would involve you getting up and moving yeah um yeah so we didn't do that
3336600	3340600	but um i was able to set it up in a few rooms in the house so we tried it out there and it's
3340600	3347160	pretty cool um i like that you can go online and print replacements for some of the stuff so i
3347160	3352120	printed out more of those barriers um so now they're all like shiny and stuff so that's kind
3352120	3359240	of fun how crazy is it by the way that when microsoft was kind of the first to put their
3359240	3365480	paw into ar gaming with the hololens and obviously we never really saw anything fully realized with
3365480	3370360	that i mean we had the there there was a a sleuthing game that was pretty good on there
3370360	3374600	but i mean obviously it never got to the level where they put out a consumer device for that
3374600	3379800	and they were talking about like a minecraft ar game but we never did get that although i kind
3379800	3384520	of think micro minecraft earth is probably bits of what we would have seen in a minecraft
3384520	3390040	hololens game but um isn't it interesting that microsoft was kind of doing that and then nintendo
3390040	3395400	just out of nowhere who we usually tease for being behind in technology when it comes to
3395400	3402040	online gaming or their vr is really you know kind of half-assed with labo compared to competitors
3402040	3407160	or they're you know just they're never the power of the of the other systems on the market
3407880	3414920	the that nintendo comes in and really puts out like hey here's our idea for an ar game and it's
3414920	3422200	really good like i don't know if it has longevity that's my concern with it but i mean just as a
3422760	3427640	cool shit for my kids to play with that'll entertain them for a while i think it's a big
3427640	3434280	win for nintendo well i'll tell you what's better than uh where it exceeds with what they did with
3434280	3441960	labo is um you can fold that all the uh checkpoints down back into a box when you're done
3441960	3448440	playing with them fair enough so that that already is like you know loads ahead of everything else
3448440	3455240	that they've done um other than that yeah it's it's fun for a while i think um i'm sure that
3455240	3461400	they'll release more stuff for it like updates and everything they could just easily put out like new
3461400	3466680	things for the scanning that does different stuff i mean and that wouldn't be that hard for them to
3466680	3474040	do um kind of disappointing that you can only do one player per system which is annoying um i get
3474040	3480280	it but like flip screen should probably be able to be a thing um so that's kind of a little
3480280	3484760	disappointing because my kids want to like kind of play together but like we don't have two systems
3484760	3488520	well i mean think of it think of it as you're paying a hundred dollars for the car you're not
3488520	3493000	paying a hundred dollars because the game is free the game you can go on shop right now and
3493000	3498280	download the game it's just not going to do shit without the car but you're really paying for the
3498280	3503640	car not the game so if you kind of frame it that way i think maybe the two-player thing might sit
3503640	3507720	a little better i don't know yeah that's the other thing too is like i pre-ordered that like a while
3507720	3517720	ago and um come release day walmart didn't ship it so i just went down to the store and they had
3517720	3522920	them there i'm like and they were ten dollars cheaper so i was like um this doesn't make any
3522920	3529400	sense but okay we'll do it this way kind of has me concerned because that's where my xbox series x
3529400	3536520	is too so we'll see um hopefully they're a little bit better about that but um so aside from the
3536520	3547960	mario kart live stuff i did play a bit of orna um i did try out pac-man uh was it pac-man geo
3549400	3557720	it's not good oh that's the one where they just made the google earth pac-man thing a game right
3558440	3564440	yeah it's it is basically that i mean they didn't there's no frills to it at all but
3564760	3569080	it's just like you can like pick different parts of the map to actually make
3570600	3578120	a level out of but you have to zoom way in to get to the streets and like i'm in a pretty small
3578120	3584920	neighborhood myself i couldn't get it to work in my neighborhood because it couldn't create a level
3584920	3591640	out of that there wasn't enough like small even smaller streets which is weird and then even when
3591720	3596280	and then even when you do have that because i was able to get it like over in fair oaks
3596280	3600920	where it's like twisty it doesn't make any sense over there i was able to get it to play on that
3600920	3607480	but the controls are awful it's all touch controls to like moving you have to swipe in the direction
3607480	3611880	that you want to go and when you have streets that are kind of they're not perpendicular to
3611880	3616520	each other and they're kind of all over the place because i mean not all streets are perpendicular
3617480	3622440	it doesn't control well at all and it just wasn't fun i played it for about five minutes
3622440	3627800	i tried a few different areas i tried one because they start you off in like a tutorial on um
3629320	3635880	oh in new york so you play there with with the statue of liberty um so i played that and then
3635880	3641880	i tried someplace closer to my house and it just was super boring and it was already starting like
3641960	3649160	hey you can buy stuff i'm like okay bye no thanks so um being that there's no it's not like an
3649160	3653800	augmented reality game where you can walk places and you know collect things and stuff like that
3653800	3660760	like pokemon go ingress orna you know all the other ones out there um it's just kind of
3660760	3665800	pointless it's basically the google little thing that they did for april fool's day and then just
3665800	3671960	worse so you can try it out it's free but like i mean i i installed that pretty quick oh and
3671960	3677400	by the way um so you have to create an account uh you can link it to social media so facebook or
3677400	3685480	twitter um to track your progress that's broken right now so you have to just not link it to
3685480	3691160	anything and so i think deleting my game on there actually lost all my pro what little progress i
3691160	3700120	had oh no um so it's just not pretty good okay um and then aside from that just been working on
3700120	3708680	game stuff and yeah pretty much it all right uh my gaming week you know we had a long intro tonight
3708680	3712760	so i can i can keep this short because i haven't really played a lot of new stuff still still
3712760	3719240	trucking along on final fantasy 14 i got my first crafter to 80 today so i think by this time next
3719240	3723960	week they'll all be to 80 my my carpenter is 80 now so i've been working on that but i did get
3723960	3728680	all my gatherers to 80 and fall nancy 14 so that's what kind of what i'm looking at and then they put
3728680	3734440	out the uh the bojjan front in this they did a mini patch this week and they did the bojjan front
3734440	3739640	um which is which is interesting uh it's they're talking a lot online about the red chocobo fight
3739640	3744600	because there is there is a a group fight that you end up doing that is a it's red comet is the
3744600	3750200	name of the chocobo and it is a red chocobo i gasped when i did the fight because i was not
3750200	3754680	prepared it does these aoes right when it draws on the ground this is the attack that it's going
3754680	3760360	to do it was nuts i had not seen anything like it in the game and i was like where the f am i
3760360	3764600	supposed to go stand that's safe i can't in this like one tiny little space that you really have
3764600	3769800	to hunt for so that that red chocobo fight was was nuts so i've been checking that out too
3770600	3777320	and then still playing hades i finally made my way to the third boss flare uh i don't want to give a
3777320	3782040	spoiler there's something different with the third boss so i i got there uh but i wasn't able to beat
3782040	3785880	it yet so i'm gonna keep working on it uh and that's it i haven't really played a lot of new
3785880	3792120	stuff the one kind of new thing i played i'm gonna have a bobby blackwolf moment here and you're
3792120	3796200	gonna understand why i said that in a minute because the only new thing i played was a demo
3797000	3801480	and i've completely judged this game based off the demo and i know like much like bobby
3801480	3807320	blackwolf and nino cooney this game can kiss my ass based off the demo guess what game that is
3807320	3812360	because this is going to surprise you is really going to surprise you kingdom hearts melody of
3812360	3818120	memories or is it memory of melodies i don't know mom kingdom hearts mom surprised it sucks
3818120	3823320	interesting it sucks i'm sorry and there's going to be people that are into it and like it and
3823320	3828120	they're going to be like rob what's your problem you're such an asshole but i just i'm sorry it
3828120	3834520	was not like i i was really irritated that they took a formula that really worked the theater
3834520	3839560	them formula and they made it this weird platforming thing and what i really hate
3840200	3846520	is that for whatever reason like some monsters you have to hit multiple times uh just for you
3846520	3850440	know because we just didn't want to note them with single monsters doing double monsters said
3850440	3855960	sometimes the monsters will be flying but these aren't the ones that you jump to hit you only
3855960	3860760	jump to hit when you see the marker that says jump and then a monster that you hit like it just
3861400	3868440	i didn't like playing it it wasn't fun and the music is okay but it's not at the same level
3868440	3872920	as theater them to me and the final fantasy series maybe it'll be more interesting when
3872920	3877560	they have let it go i don't know but the songs that they have in there now were not
3877560	3884360	that great to me so that's it and bobby blackwolf in chat says yep i knew it i also wasn't very
3884360	3892600	happy with the demo i wanted theater them um let's see uh i'm trying to see if there's other
3892600	3899400	comments there uh phoenix 77 26 says not gonna lie i'm kind of tired of kingdom hearts deviating
3899400	3904600	as much as they do and akuma jp oh welcome back i haven't seen you in a while akuma jp in chat
3904600	3911160	says rob let it go um i will i'm gonna let it go straight to the recycle bin and you can kiss my
3911160	3918760	big butt if you think i'm gonna spend 60 50 on that game maybe 10 bucks on a dumpster sale
3920040	3924680	later on like in two years time because it is a square enix game after all but i just i'm not
3924680	3930440	gonna pay that much more than it um shad star six in chat right now and says i liked the demo for
3930520	3935640	kingdom hearts it's just different and it worked for me well i'm glad it worked for somebody and
3935640	3942200	you know what bobby hated nino cooney and i ended up really liking that game so you can take my
3942200	3947240	opinion and throw it away if you want but that is my opinion and i'm sticking to it the demo
3947240	3951960	was supposed to impress me and make me think they've made some good changes to theater them
3951960	3958680	and oh maybe i want to see theater them released released like this no i don't no i don't like it
3958680	3966280	no no the end all right let's move on uh we're gonna get into some gaming news oh
3966280	3969160	actually i think we do have a few housekeeping things to get into because jamie you wanted to
3969160	3976680	bring something up right yes so um i'm working on expanding a few things because our blogging stuff
3976680	3983160	has kind of you know fallen by the wayside you know um and i love writing writing is you know
3983160	3991800	kind of you know my big thing so um i have created a blog there will be some video content on its way
3991800	4001000	there will be a related podcast on its way but it's called genexgeeks.com that's g-e-e-x so g-e-n-x
4001000	4009800	g-e-x.com i have twitter for it which is also genexgeeks um and i'm looking i mean basically
4009800	4015880	since it's you know gen x it's you know our our generation of stuff although definitely going into
4015880	4019960	you know the other stuff that we're into because i don't think that interest should be generational
4019960	4023560	but there certainly is perspective that we have that maybe other people don't
4024120	4029640	um and it's it's not just you know like i got a lot of stuff for video games i have some nerdy
4029640	4035400	stuff for you know movies and anime and also some self-care stuff on there like irl stuff you know
4036040	4041800	like what are what are we doing in the world around us what types of things can we do to help
4041800	4047800	other people um you know kind of community oriented um and there will i've kept i keep
4047800	4052600	forgetting to add the pinball thing on there too but so um i'd appreciate it if people would check
4052600	4061080	it out and leave me some feedback it just started um but i think that um it'd be a little way to
4061080	4068760	expand i guess my voice as a gamer and as a geeky person you know yeah so let me ask you this
4068760	4072200	because i already know the answer there's going to be other people out there that probably don't so
4072200	4080680	just to let you kind of state this how is this different than vog it is a very different
4080680	4088840	perspective because you know vog is basically going to be specifically you know really well
4088840	4092360	it's kind of hard for me to describe it how did i describe it to you before because
4092360	4101080	it's it's part i think part but expanded i think um also it's more one person's perspective whereas
4101080	4104920	the voice of geeks network is really about all of the voices and putting that together
4104920	4109880	and i think the comparison you and i were talking about was um when we had electric sisterhood that
4109880	4114280	was a part of the voice of geeks network um electric sisterhood was also a site that had
4114280	4117880	all their own types of blog posts and all their own types of news and did their own types of
4117880	4122920	reviews and things that were kind of unique to their perspective and obviously they've moved on
4122920	4127240	to their new project black compat shout out to that because i'm always going to when i bring
4127240	4131560	them up um but i think that was kind of like i was saying when you were talking to me about this i
4131560	4135160	was like oh it kind of sounds like you know like when esh had their own sort of site and the same
4135160	4140280	thing with a critical myth an anime jam session uh is still around and kind of does their own
4140280	4145880	anime focused content and articles and things on that site so yeah and i was also thinking that i
4145880	4156680	mean a network isn't necessarily you know an audio or visual thing right right you know and if what i
4156680	4163480	have to say on there resonates with people who maybe you know and not to say anything about you
4163480	4169560	guys i love you guys but maybe they want to hear somebody who is not a cisgender man and has you
4169560	4176040	know a different perspective well you know i to be fair we're really trying to not have that always
4176040	4183720	be the case you know we try to mix that up i know but i just threw it out there as an example or say
4183720	4190040	that you know if someone's looking for a little bit more of a lifestyle thing like hey what what
4190040	4197480	is self-care for someone of our generation what is this you know can you teach me how to adult the
4197480	4205240	answer is no um you know so i'm really looking on kind of expanding what geekery in the real world
4205240	4210440	is about does that make sense i think so i think uh you have to go check it out and it'll make more
4210440	4218920	sense i like what ej ron meh said um uh vog is all ages genics geek real shit yeah this is kind of
4218920	4224120	like how i'm taking it like you know i've already written a couple of articles about um supernatural
4224120	4229720	ending i've done um i've actually got two cosplay articles coming and they're just really short
4229720	4234360	because i mean that's the thing i want it to be quick and easy and digestible so i have two
4234360	4239320	articles coming up from some prominent cosplayers and actually one of them is my friend annie who
4239320	4249000	um does uh saver podcast and uh stuff mom never told you and um i also have uh another one from a
4249000	4255960	really good cosplayer from rkd cosplay um i asked for like one question and got a big write-up so
4255960	4263480	said i'll just do this all you then um um and i'm looking for you know people if if they want to uh
4263480	4268040	you know if they have something to say i'll give them i'll give them a spot um i'm actually working
4268040	4275000	out something with my friend hillary who runs a 28-year salon here in the sacramento area
4275000	4281000	um about uh you know things like hair care and stuff like that but you know because there's this
4281000	4286200	whole big trend now for you know hair colors and stuff that you see you know in video games
4286200	4291960	and anime and stuff um so we'll be talking about stuff like that you know it's it's really geek
4291960	4299480	lifestyle you know but for those of us who have maybe a little bit more money than you know the
4299480	4304920	the younger ones um you know maybe people who have a lot more like real life stuff going on
4304920	4312680	people maybe who have uh physical limitations you know due to you know like i'm 44 and i have
4312680	4319000	arthritis in my hips so i can't go out and play all the ddr in the universe like i used to so i
4319000	4323240	would be talking about well what are ways that you can protect yourself when you're going out to play
4323240	4329880	a high impact video game you something like that so that's kind of you know kind of my thing for
4329880	4335400	those of us who remembers when mtv played videos for example all right so everybody check that out
4335400	4342120	it's gen x geeks with an x.com right yeah i get that right okay thank you um and i will say on
4342120	4347480	the vog front we have some exciting stuff coming soon we just need to cry i can't say much more
4347480	4353320	than that just we got across the t's and dot some i's but a very some very good conversations were
4353320	4357880	had behind the scenes and uh i'm hoping we got more to say in a couple weeks that's all i can
4357880	4363960	really say for now so um i've probably already said too much so let's move on uh let's get into
4363960	4371960	some news so loki we're gonna start with you tonight with some gaming news yeah so the ps4
4371960	4379000	just received the 8.0 update making some tweaks to the party and messaging functionality
4380040	4385640	some of this stuff is also going to be tied into the playstation 5 as well so what they did was
4385640	4391720	they kind of streamlined everything changing the ui with that they also have this nice mute all
4391720	4400520	option as well some new avatars that you can choose from and simpler parental controls
4402360	4407400	one of the other things though that they did mention with this though is basically there's a
4407400	4411640	a little warning message that pops up says following this update users are seeing a
4411640	4417560	notification about party safety and that voice chats and parties may be recorded voice chat
4417560	4422600	recording for moderation is a feature that'll be available on the playstation 5 when it launches
4422600	4428200	and will enable users to record their voice chats on ps5 and submit them for moderation
4428200	4434120	review i'm assuming not your own voice chats but like other people obviously on the voice chat you
4434120	4441080	know so they can ban those rude people or whatever um but basically it's just letting you know that
4441080	4446600	if you're playing with somebody on a playstation 5 that your voice chat may be recorded as part of
4446600	4454200	their functionality um of course people are kind of concerned that sony listening to my voice chats
4455160	4460120	no that's not what they're doing apparently they don't have time to do that stuff but do you think
4460120	4465720	okay let's well let's be honest there's going to be people that have those series and and they
4465720	4472280	could be right or wrong could they be listening for phrases like you know and i'm going to use
4472280	4476840	this as an example in case i set something off on twitch okay just for the purpose of discussion
4476840	4482040	but let's say someone says a phrase like i'm going to blow up a federal building you know or whatever
4482520	4485960	it is or they're talking they're making those sorts of plans and i don't know why you would
4485960	4490760	use playstation to do it but we've heard about those types of groups congregating in in places
4490760	4496680	you wouldn't necessarily think of because they're less monitored so could sony system listen for
4496680	4502520	those types of phrases i mean i guess it's within the realm of possibility since everything listens
4502520	4511800	to you nowadays but um my thing though is and i i think someone brought the um idea up is let's say
4511800	4517960	that you do get i'm assuming not let's say that let's let's just assume that the only
4519480	4524920	that the submission by users isn't the only way that they're monitoring everything let's just say
4524920	4531400	that they are listening for key phrases like that well if that's the case that's done by an
4531400	4537800	algorithm and we know that algorithms are not necessarily the most accurate or best thing to do
4538520	4543000	i mean but obviously with the kind of volume that they're going to have that's the only way they can
4543000	4549880	do it but it's not 100 accurate and we have seen in the case of like youtube and twitch and stuff
4549880	4554840	that there can be false bans from some of that stuff and with not a lot of moderation that could
4554840	4560280	get out of hand pretty quick my understanding though is i think if you do get banned
4561240	4567160	um with that kind of uh based on something like that that you actually lose access to your
4567160	4574280	playstation library that you have as well um because you'd be locked out from your account
4574280	4579480	i'm not sure if that's necessarily 100 accurate that's just the concerns i've heard but i think
4579480	4585880	maybe taking a little bit too far i am glad that they at least have an option to submit a chat if
4585880	4591160	there is and i don't even know if they'd necessarily be a party chat per se because
4591160	4596040	i doubt you'd be having people in your own party that are being ridiculous that yeah you're being
4596040	4600760	absolutely rude i would think it's more of just regular in-game audio where you have somebody that
4601640	4608760	you know is is being toxic one of those little a-holes that's saying you know f-word f-word
4608760	4613480	n-word n-word right and so i would assume that you know as part of that you could report them
4613480	4618280	and then it would be record but to be able to do that though it would have to be recording your
4618280	4624440	audio at all times so well you know yeah here's the other thing too and and it's interesting
4624440	4630360	because in chat um uh they're saying uh what was the comment here uh try dean and chat says rob
4630360	4634200	shouldn't have said that look i went out of my way to make sure i was saying is for the purposes
4634200	4638920	of news and discussion only uh and there's a fifth dream in chat says that's exactly what
4638920	4642840	i'll tell the secret service when they arrive at my door tomorrow fifth dream in chat says they're
4642840	4648120	already reviewing the policies after reading reading feedback from users well i mean and to
4648120	4651160	be fair to look at both sides of this so i give you that side but then the other side i'm going
4651160	4656440	to give you is isn't the playstation 4 already recording things it's recording your gameplay for
4656440	4662360	15 minutes it's taking screenshots whenever it wants because when the game when something crashes
4662360	4666280	on your playstation 4 and i know this because it happened in no man's sky not that long ago like
4666280	4672360	just less than two weeks ago i was playing no man's sky and and i had a random crash and it said do
4672440	4679480	you want to attach a video and all this of your gameplay so your ps4 is already watching you no
4679480	4683640	of course it is because they have the share functionality and that's why when you push the
4683640	4688680	button to record a short video it's of footage that you've already played so it is recording
4688680	4695880	a short bit of your gameplay already um but it's just it's not really doing anything with it i i
4695880	4701320	don't really necessarily have a huge problem with it um i don't either because i kind of think it's
4701320	4705800	already happening exactly you have to be completely naive if you don't believe that everything's not
4705800	4711720	being monitored i mean there's if you're using a service obviously it's gonna have their caveats
4711720	4721000	and it's you know just privacy concerns aside you know if it'll make the online um environment
4722280	4729160	better like we're gonna see less toxic people because of it then that's cool um what i want
4729160	4733800	to know because i haven't used playstation 4 why i haven't played my playstation 4 in a long time
4733800	4740520	um i'm curious if the playstation 4 chat functionality is like as easy it was like on the
4740520	4744760	xbox 360 is kind of what i remember where you can actually kind of do a chat people can be playing
4744760	4749560	different games you know and that type of thing it's easy to invite people in and that type of
4749560	4757640	stuff i don't know if that's ever been that easy on playstation 4 i don't know well hopefully this
4757640	4765640	is better um um act f says yeah you can um ssh100 matt and it has a really good comment here um
4765640	4772680	that i want to read says the main thing um is sony and others have to do something to fix
4772680	4778520	online harassment if it has to be done this way i totally get it one of my issues with it is that
4778520	4784280	sony is handling it who has a history of data security kind of wish a different firm was
4784280	4790680	handling it so maybe bringing in a third party to take care of that or something hmm um at def
4790680	4795720	points out uh with that scenario you were bringing up loki we do that for our overwatch sessions
4795720	4803240	since some of our players play stuff like fall guys and genshin impact so all right well um
4803240	4808120	yeah i know my firmware update already uh came through for the playstation 4 so uh there's that
4808120	4813560	was there um anything else we want to talk about here with the playstation updates um yeah so i did
4813560	4818440	want to mention that they're also revamping the playstation store um i believe this is mainly
4818440	4825560	referring to their web and mobile store so they're removing playstation 3 playstation vita and
4825560	4831800	playstation portable um games and add-ons along with apps themes and avatars for those platforms
4831800	4837560	as well so apparently the web and mobile versions of the store um should be done removing those by
4837560	4843480	october 28th and then apparently if you need access to those after the fact you're gonna have
4843480	4849160	to access those through those devices so like the playstation 3 or whatnot um
4851640	4856440	i kind of wish it wasn't going that way because that kind of i mean you know with the whole
4856440	4861400	backwards compatibility stuff i guess they're just not going to support that stuff anymore
4861400	4867640	um i don't know i wonder how long until they just pull the plug all together on the psp store
4868520	4874280	and then the ps3 psp yeah i can understand a lot of that stuff um it's pretty old but
4875320	4885480	yeah it is unfortunate uh fifth dream in chat says rip psp yeah i i have a feeling that's coming uh
4885480	4888760	sooner than you might think that they're just going to pull the store all together on that
4888760	4892760	and decide not to run that anymore because it's probably just not worth it to them they're
4892760	4897000	probably not selling a lot although i would think the psp second hand market is still pretty big
4897000	4900600	i mean do those machines have a good lifespan i don't know like i mean
4901160	4905640	not with the batteries man all those batteries i think we talked about like oh yeah all the
4907400	4914280	i had to throw mine away well actually it's funny i had like um i had like four psp i had my psp
4914760	4922840	um 1.0 and then i had 2.0 and then my co-worker gave me two of his um psp's as well because they
4922840	4929160	were kind of defective or whatever use and i did just the disk drives on them didn't work but you
4929160	4935000	could still use them for like other games um but all of them all of the batteries i had are all
4935000	4940760	just complete trash now i'm like it's not worth it i don't care anymore i have i have i still have
4940760	4948120	my somewhere i i was looking for it earlier this week but um i still have my um my playstation tv
4948120	4955000	so um i mean i could play all that stuff on there i'm just have to find it i found my steam
4955000	4961160	or steam link but then not my playstation tv all right well let's move on and talk a little bit
4961160	4965720	about it's funny because i was talking about nino cooney and i kind of name check and bobby
4965720	4970200	blackwolf earlier in the show so maybe he's celebrating over this news i don't know but
4970200	4975800	i think this is kind of sad actually and that is that level five is uh pretty much done in
4975800	4981240	north america it sounds like um level five international america which was of course
4981240	4987800	uh the company that brought us nino cooney as well as yokai watch uh here in the north america
4987800	4992600	uh they're pretty much done and this is according to a report from gameindustry.biz
4992600	4997480	uh talking to multiple sources familiar with the matter uh they're saying that level five
4997480	5004280	international america and level five abby began winding down in mid-2019 which included laying off
5004280	5014760	the staff um so that they were let go uh and uh yeah apparently uh the coo yukari hayakawa who's
5014760	5020360	the coo of level five abby departed the company in early 2020 even though her linkedin has apparently
5020360	5025000	not been updated yet but i know a lot of people who have out-of-date linkedin so um what's what's
5025000	5031640	a ceo of a co of a company um so yeah apparently this is just saying that basically uh this could
5031640	5036360	be the end of level five releases in north america now i want to point out level five is still around
5036360	5041640	in japan this is again level five closing down their business in north america which could be
5041640	5048120	a sign that things like yokai watch and you know cooney were not maybe catching on as much as it
5048120	5053640	was hoped they would and i know especially in the case of yokai watch like they really pushed that
5053640	5059320	stuff hard and i didn't think that game was bad by any means uh but i was kind of surprised at
5059320	5064360	how much they were pushing you know the anime the toys and the game really hadn't proved itself yet
5064360	5068760	and i'm not sure it ever did at least here in america now i know in japan it was craziness
5068760	5073400	but even the craziness of that franchise in japan has died down a lot from what i understand so
5073400	5079400	i just don't think it was able to sustain itself in america anymore um so yeah any uh any releases
5079400	5084920	in north america apparently not happening because level five had said yokai watch 4 was going to
5084920	5090920	happen back in july 2019 but nothing has been said then since then there was also supposed to be a
5090920	5099320	version over here of inazuma 11 uh the hero's great road but again nothing here the last release from
5099320	5106040	level 5 in north america snack world the dungeon crawl gold which i never heard of but i know level
5106040	5109880	five did a lot of random dungeon crawlers like didn't they do an adventure time related one at
5109880	5116200	some point i think they did so i don't know um let's see and bobby blackwolf like to point out
5116200	5122600	i never celebrate closures so fair enough but you didn't help no i'm just i'm just i'm being a brat
5123160	5131640	akuma jp says oh eek they blow up on yokai watch yokai watch is not selling anymore here so yeah
5131640	5135800	so i thought i had heard that that it really kind of fizzled in japan it used to be a huge huge thing
5135800	5141240	and it kind of uh sj100 matt says this is surprising act dev says isn't level five behind
5141240	5146440	the latent series 2 oh i think you are right um but we haven't seen one of those games in a while
5146440	5151720	too and perhaps the end of the 3ds yes they could make those for switch but maybe they're just not
5151720	5155960	going to for whatever reason yeah this kind of came out of left field for me too i i thought
5155960	5161080	level five had some good stuff um i you know usually when i saw their name on a title i would
5161080	5165880	kind of give it a second look because i enjoyed their stuff you know despite the banter we have
5165880	5171480	going on i enjoyed nino kuni although i didn't ever pick up the sequel so maybe i'm part to blame
5171480	5178040	for that i tried yokai watch i didn't get into it as much but i never really beat a pokemon game
5178040	5183240	until finally pokemon shield finally uh broke that for me where i actually played that start
5183240	5191080	to finish and the end game so i don't know so anyhow uh yeah too bad to hear about that you
5191080	5196120	know again and like bobby said on a serious note note uh closures are nothing to celebrate about
5196120	5201240	this is sad news and you know especially for those of us that like to see a lot of the you know games
5201240	5208520	in japan released here as well um it's it's some sad news that's for sure so um is dark sakura
5208520	5215320	back by chance i don't know if she's just off i am okay hi hi sorry no i was uh i was eating a food
5215320	5220280	oh you're fine i just wasn't sure if i needed to buy time or not but we can go to your story if
5220280	5227960	you're ready no i um my story is actually going to be probably the first one of this company's
5227960	5235480	products that i am going to buy oh please tell us more so there is um i'm sure we're all familiar
5235480	5242040	with analog analog is responsible for giving us their own a super famicon and super gen super
5242600	5249640	super genesis mega drive you know sega genesis etc um versions of it you know they've had 1080p
5249640	5255880	output and all of this beautiful stuff um they are now as i'm sure no one is surprised by this
5256440	5264840	i'm going to be doing a turbo duo um for the turbo graphics 16 slash pc engine with the you
5264840	5271720	know built-in duo add-on um it will come in a a white one like the japanese or a black one like
5271720	5278840	the us and it's gonna be 200 bucks which is actually pretty low priced for one of analog's
5278840	5286920	uh you know uh systems the other good thing about this one is that it is going to be able to play
5286920	5295160	um uh both uh regions a few cards it does not use software emulation um and instead uses field
5295160	5302520	programmable gate array chip um so it's basically simulating the game system by hardware um it will
5302520	5310120	be um arcade card ready it will run all turbo graphics 16 pc engine super graphics which of
5310120	5316200	course there were like what eight games that were released um uh pc engine cd rom 2 are
5316200	5324280	super arcade cd rom games so like i said arcade card games um and basically um it's also going
5324280	5329560	to have a wireless controller but it does have the nec port on it to allow you to use original
5329560	5335960	duo controllers and multitaps so um it also like i said it's going to support other bluetooth and
5335960	5344440	usb controllers um it uses hdmi so it will allow you it will output to 1080p um and given what
5344440	5349160	i've seen from the other outputs on other systems it's going to be pretty pretty awesome um it was
5349160	5354120	always nice and clear didn't they do that game boy that came out not that long ago that was
5354120	5359480	it was all over the internet yeah okay and of course it's going to have an add-on for that
5359480	5367400	thing for the analog pocket um it's going to have an adapter that lets you play um the other hue
5367400	5374600	cards the turbo graphics 16 super graphics and pc engine hue cards um and i mean that'll be that'll
5374600	5380120	be pretty nice i mean i have a turbo express and it's kind of difficult to play on i'll be
5380120	5387080	perfectly honest just don't play your shooter games on it um so it's i think it's really nice
5387080	5396520	and it's about time and i'll be honest you know i've been pricing a duo rx so that i um wouldn't
5396520	5402520	you know i have i basically have arcade card games that i can't play like i have a fatal
5402520	5409560	fury special i have strider and i can't play any of them um so this right here i was going to be
5409560	5415160	paying about 250 for my duo rx you know for one in a really good shape boxing you know everything
5415880	5422600	um the hue card converter that i want is almost always sold out and runs about 100 bucks by itself
5423240	5432040	i have a core graphics but i can't you know again play um duo games on it you know that i would need
5432040	5438040	the core graphics in the duo and then the arcade card and i can't use those cards on my us duo
5438040	5445960	because the pin set was different so um this right here is going to eliminate a couple of
5445960	5450520	other products that i would have been spending money on i mean i was seriously looking to spend
5450520	5456600	like roughly 300 350 to get to do rx and get myself the us u card converter so we just had
5456600	5463640	the one system um so this right here is i think it'd be a fantastic deal i can plug it in um on
5463640	5471080	my hd uh you know my nice fantabulous 4k tv and um not have any input lag which is one of the
5471080	5477320	biggest problems with playing retro systems on modern televisions right so you know could the
5477320	5482040	limited availability of this be an issue because bobby is speaking up on this a lot in chat saying
5482040	5486120	this was cool until they said limited quantities which means nobody will actually be able to get
5486120	5490520	one i really question their business practices if they can't actually meet the demand at the price
5490520	5495080	they quote this sounds great for the boders that will buy and flip it on ebay just like the last
5495080	5501160	analog plot product i learned to never hype for them well i mean it works for nintendo all t l
5501160	5511400	shade um i might be reaching out to a potential contact um to bring up uh i'm hoping because i
5511400	5518600	want to do like a full review of it um so i'm i'm gonna be trying to do some some reaching out and
5518600	5524120	seeing who i can talk to and well you know to to be fair yay for you if that works out but
5524120	5529800	the point still stands that you know it's it's way too limited and why is it so damn limited
5529800	5533560	if the demand is a bit higher you know and i think there's going to be another release
5533560	5538840	if well let's hold out let's hope but i guess maybe the track record hasn't really spoke
5538840	5542920	kindly for that because that would be really unfortunate if it just becomes a thing that
5542920	5548200	scalpers on ebay kind of get it would be nice to see the company maybe do some sort of you can sign
5548200	5552680	up to pre-order one or something like that you know kind of trying to figure out that system
5552680	5559160	because the popularity and the fact that you know the these products have been all around the news
5559160	5563960	sphere when it comes to video games they've been all over social media and everybody is saying
5563960	5568440	these look really cool it's a compliment to the company and everything but surely the company's
5568440	5571720	got to kind of realize that it puts a certain demand out there and if they can't meet that
5571720	5580840	demand it could it could backfire if that that's that's a good point but but i you know
5582600	5587720	i want to see if maybe we can reach out and see if maybe we can talk to the people there and see
5587720	5592200	if they're going to be doing anything to combat that you know the the big scalper resale because
5592200	5598440	i mean it's it's certainly a possibility um and i know that it'd be a big problem in the end they
5598600	5604760	make their money so it is what it is yeah but it's up to us to not buy from scalpers but
5604760	5608280	we all know like we can sit here and say that till we're blue in the face but there's going
5608280	5614360	to be somebody that sits on top of their mansion and you know beverly hills that has the screaming
5614360	5619160	child mommy mommy mommy i saw this on the internet i want one buy it buy it and so they just go on
5619160	5623640	ebay and get it you know and it's okay veruca yeah well i mean and that's that's the problem
5623640	5627000	is that we can sit here and say we're gonna we're not gonna support it right it's trash
5627000	5630440	but the veruca's of the world are gonna and the enabling parents are gonna ruin it
5631160	5637960	yeah so it stinks we'll see but i i do think to be fair i think this is a problem bigger than
5637960	5643800	just this company this is a problem we're seeing all over the place you know in this industry and
5643800	5648760	fifth dream says cough ps5 cough you know we had all the issues with the pre-orders there as well
5648760	5656600	and so on so i i i kind of get it so all right um let's move on though for now um just for time's
5656600	5659960	sake i can't spend too much time on one topic because we had such a great um kickoff topic
5659960	5664040	that went on for a while but let's move on to our next topic because this is this is i mean
5664040	5669720	this is huge this this in a normal week could have been a whole three hour show to itself right well
5669720	5678520	i think it's huge it says it's so this right here by itself is not much so basically what the deal
5678520	5684520	is is game stop and microsoft had entered into a multi-year strategic partnership um that's going
5684520	5689400	to basically outfit their stores with surface tablets and it's also going to revamp their whole
5689400	5696120	pos system as well um allowing them to use like microsoft 365 and teams and stuff like that
5696840	5702520	also with that though they're also doing some sort of it's not really in great detail yet but
5702520	5709320	they're doing some sort of partnership where it'll allow them to sell digital products that are on
5709320	5715080	the microsoft store and actually get a cut or i'm sorry no what's going to happen is i hear is
5715080	5721160	that they're going to be getting a cut of any of the digital sales from consoles that they sell
5721160	5727480	so for example if they sell some xbox series x those consoles that they sell any users that buy
5727480	5734520	those and make purchases they get like a percentage of that which is interesting here's what i think
5734600	5740680	is happening from what i was hearing so if they think about it though like you know they're giving
5740680	5747000	them all this access to these things how far away do you think we are from microsoft buying out game
5747000	5754600	stuff because they're they're struggling money-wise right now they're really struggling to to stay
5754600	5761480	afloat and so i'm wondering if we're not far enough or not that far away from an acquisition
5761480	5765720	well and you know the other interesting thing that i haven't seen in any of the stories talking
5765720	5774600	about this what just happened like four months ago microsoft stores started scaling back significantly
5774600	5783960	yeah so this has been in the works for a little bit why why would they you know i think that was
5783960	5787480	the first thing because we kind of at the time we're like well this seems kind of i mean i guess
5787480	5791720	it must be related to the pandemic and that's sad and all this stuff but now it's kind of like oh
5791720	5796040	shit they scaled back the microsoft stores because they knew they were going to be getting into the
5796040	5802360	game stops basically everywhere with this whole thing um now again uh you know it's not like
5802360	5806680	you're suddenly it's going to be microsoft exclusive at those places that's not the case
5806680	5812040	you can still buy a playstation 5 you can still buy a switch but it is definitely going to put
5812600	5819080	a little pressure on the folks that work there the management which will trickle down to the workers
5819080	5826120	that hey if we make continued money off of microsoft's uh sales on an xbox series s now
5826120	5830840	we know why game stop would fucking bother to carry them because now they're going to be getting
5830840	5838360	a revenue based off of the the digital sales and on the playstation 5 discless ones there is no
5838360	5843880	reason for game stop to have any of those they probably will have one or two per store but
5843880	5850680	there's really no reason for them to carry them or or maybe you know it i would i would think that
5850680	5854840	there might be an acquisition being that they're they've been closing stores left and right and
5854840	5859720	they've been in trouble for a while and the pandemic hasn't really helped them out um but
5859720	5867160	the very least maybe it's just microsoft recognizing this company um needs some
5867160	5872440	infrastructure upgrades and they're just doing a partnership with them in that sense and on top of
5872440	5877800	that they're also going to try to push their consoles and um i don't know i don't know if
5877800	5883880	they're necessarily going to buy them out i mean we'll see it'll be interesting to see what happens
5883880	5889320	with this but i know that financially i don't think they're doing very well um with the pandemic
5889320	5893800	and everything i find this comment from questposter really fascinating um because i really agree with
5893800	5899880	it uh saying game stop stock is up 120 plus percent for the year but not because of this news
5899880	5906200	some analysts don't think that this is that huge since the winner is mainly microsoft
5906200	5912840	seemingly taking advantage of a weak game stop to push people into their ecosystem hell yeah they
5912840	5918280	are and it's it's it's a brilliant move by my it's straight up genius by microsoft i'm sorry like
5918280	5925160	that's it that's that's what it is because now when it comes to the holidays and the lost parents
5925160	5931000	that are like what do i get my kid my kid's been talking about xbox and playstation i don't know
5931000	5939000	the difference although again i think the parents of today grew up on the same stuff i mean we're
5939000	5944520	old enough to be the parents now loki is a parent many of you out there listening are so i'm not
5944520	5948840	sure this is always going to be the case but i think still in some parts of the country in some
5948840	5953960	areas you're going to have people to walk into the game stop going i i know my kid wants this
5953960	5959080	but i don't know what i need to get like the default answer is going to be pushing towards
5959080	5965800	microsoft products now and that is a brilliant move on microsoft's part uh right yeah so they'll
5965800	5971080	have two different friends because i think also when you like there's a definite value propositions
5971080	5979560	be made with you know the xbox platforms um i'm just curious to see what sony's going to answer
5979560	5983720	back with as far as like what they're offering i just don't think playstation now is going to be
5983720	5989240	enough to cut it and i'm sorry like cool that you're giving away a few games with playstation
5989240	5996600	plus but that's not the same as the entire library that's in games pass i mean it's just not the same
5996600	6004360	well you know and i i don't want to base the reality based off of what i see on social media
6004360	6009480	but it doesn't seem like sony's exactly struggling like it seems like plenty of people are still
6010280	6014280	pre-ordering a playstation 5 and there's plenty of games on there that people want to play and
6014280	6018520	i think that is sony's biggest strength still is that they do have this very strong first party
6018520	6024120	titles still and they're gonna have that you know for some time but you know as i've been saying
6024120	6028520	until i'm blue in the face on the show for a long time now don't count off microsoft this time
6028520	6034520	around and akuma jp in chat is saying i wonder if japan will be able to play bethesda games now
6034520	6040600	um akuma the reality is and i realize you're gonna laugh at this and microsoft still thinks
6040600	6046840	they can succeed in japan um but they're playing the long game it's not something that's necessarily
6046840	6053080	going to happen tomorrow and part of succeeding in japan is really starting to turn the heads here
6053080	6058520	in the states and then i think they're gonna hope that that carries out but i the quickest way to do
6058520	6063560	it and you know we've been saying this forever is is still shocked that microsoft didn't just
6063560	6069560	fucking outright buy sega or um konami or somebody that is feels a little bit vulnerable in the
6069560	6075080	japanese market and i kind of think that's the big that's the big grand finale that's the big
6075080	6081880	symbol clash that ends 2020 is that microsoft's gonna buy a japanese company i think but we'll see
6082840	6090760	yeah still time dj rama s in chat says microsoft will not succeed in japan
6090760	6095880	because they don't have any japanese game studios under their belt yet
6098040	6100760	they don't have any under their belt yet
6103320	6109000	and i think i laugh laugh in my face if you want but let's revisit this in a year and see what
6109000	6116600	happens we shall see we shall see all right for now though let's move on and talk about some
6116600	6124200	upgrades uh for the xbox 360 that's right the the older system the xbox 360 cloud saves are now
6124200	6128920	going to be free so you can actually just get your saves in the cloud for free this was something that
6128920	6134600	you had to have xbox gold for before oh look at that another xbox gold feature just getting
6134600	6143800	absorbed into something else huh huh huh anyway it's gonna be free now on the xbox 360 because
6143800	6148760	they want people to have their savings in the clouds to feel a little more like they can get
6148760	6154840	an xbox series s or a series x because you know some people just skip the xbox one outright in
6154840	6160760	fact a lot of people did that may have owned the 360 but maybe now the series s or x is going to
6160760	6166600	look at bringing them back so how can they transfer their maybe they have a file in oblivion
6166600	6172520	that they've spent 200 hours on so they want to be able to move that over to the xbox series x
6172520	6179640	because we know that series x and s are going to be backwards compatible uh pretty richly uh if
6179640	6184520	it's uh something you can play on the xbox one today you'll be able to play it on the xbox series
6184520	6190680	x now if it has enhancements or not we'll get into that a little later um but it it will be
6190680	6196200	nice that you know and it's not all the systems do this so it will be nice that hey even if you
6196200	6202120	are skipping a generation so you're on xbox 360 now you skip the one and you go your games are
6202120	6207080	still going to be backwards compatible mostly there are some 360 games that don't work as we
6207080	6212520	all know but the big ones they they figured out and the ones that you probably have a 200 hour
6212520	6217400	save file on probably uh figure that one out how to make it backwards compatible so that's kind of
6217400	6224280	neat um but i also think it's kind of funny that uh they figured out a way to just completely um
6225880	6232120	absorb yet another xbox live gold feature into something else so anyway uh now let's talk a
6232120	6237080	little bit more back about those backwards compatibility games because it came out this week
6237080	6246920	that there's going to be 31 series x or s optimized games on day one so obviously because
6246920	6253000	halo isn't making the release day a lot of the strength that microsoft's trying to push for
6253000	6260680	their launch day windows is upgrades of older games so um let me read you some of the highlights
6260680	6267640	i'm not going to read them all assassin's greed vahala borderlands 3 dead by daylight dirt 5
6268280	6276360	uh the falconeer forza horizon 4 gears 5 gears tactics grounded manifold garden or in the will
6276360	6283880	of the wisp planet coaster sea of thieves tetris effect connected the tourist uh watchdogs legion
6283880	6289640	yakuza like a dragon uh and so on again that's just a selection of the 31 games there that are
6289640	6296120	going to be available on day one so this is kind of microsoft's strategy is not just the new new
6296120	6300920	stuff like vahala is a new game so not just that but then also like here are the older games and
6300920	6306280	even i kind of went oh shit i can't wait to play forza horizon 4 on the xbox series x that's going
6306280	6310120	to be awesome and now hearing that they've bumped it up a little bit you know i don't know exactly
6310120	6315000	what that looks like but i imagine that's going to be some higher res texture and probably some
6315000	6319480	yeah it's going to be a real smooth frame rate i'm sure so i that game's going to be pretty badass
6319480	6327880	i think so excited for that so we'll see uh we're getting to less than a month away now if you can
6327880	6333640	believe it before the new consoles both xbox series x and s and the new playstation fives are
6333640	6338520	out pretty much in the same week and it's what the 10th and the 12th right did i get those dates
6338520	6344600	right the 10th is the xbox the 12th in the playstation i know the 10th is the xbox i can't
6344760	6348920	remember the place i think it's the 12th so they're right they're right on top of
6348920	6353160	each other practically and we're less than a month away so uh yeah pretty exciting times
6353160	6360520	that's for sure all right how about dark sakura what's next well i've made no secret one of my
6360520	6367880	favorite games ever is fantasy zone and there is a game being released that is an homage to fantasy
6367880	6377240	zone called endless zone um it actually has come out uh a couple of days ago it's on pc via steam
6377240	6383000	and it's part of sega's 60th anniversary um and it's only going to be available until the 19th
6383000	6393560	until tomorrow so um basically it is you know pretty much just like fantasy zone but you play
6393560	6400040	instead of as the opa opa you have op bot um who was a field surgeon and organ recovery specialist
6400040	6408840	and then one day he was on the run and he has to flee and exist so go check it out because
6410280	6414680	i i noticed it didn't look very cartoony either i had a very different kind of gritty look to it
6414680	6421400	it was like fantasy zone rated r kind of look to it it's still you know i mean part of what i liked
6421400	6425800	about fantasy zone was the the cuteness and the happy music and it's fucking hard as balls
6425800	6431640	but um but i mean still it's snowmaj remember how the super mario brothers movie was supposed
6431640	6436360	to be kind of gritty and industrial that's what i kind of got looking at endless zone
6436360	6439480	well i don't know about the terrible part i didn't play endless zone i'm sure it's fine
6439480	6448040	it reminds me of like those like um oh what was it like the the xbox 360 arcade games that they
6448040	6453000	were making like of the classic arcade games and oh they're kind of like kind of redone or like if
6453000	6458120	we want to talk a little bit more crystal quest was like gritty whenever you talk a little bit
6458120	6465240	more like recent um you know kind of similar to the stuff that we see now on uh the amico
6465240	6473240	where like these classic games are kind of getting that uh you know higher res i don't know they still
6473240	6478600	look like xbox arcade games um you know where it's like they don't know what to do with the
6478600	6482360	sprites so they just kind of make them a little bit more realistic and they come off looking like
6483320	6489720	not really a flash game but just i don't know different but yeah this looks kind of like that
6490280	6497160	okay yeah excited that was uh the week we missed was that whole uh in television stuff that came
6497160	6503960	out um that was uh the week that i was out um but uh i don't know like i i could see the thing is
6503960	6509320	though we we say all that but i also kind of go i liked a lot of those early xbox arcade games i
6509320	6515320	actually played them a lot you know they kind of throw me back to a period of the atari 2600 when
6515320	6520200	you know i just that that repetition and that same z type of game was a lot of fun to play
6520200	6524280	it was something very zen about it so like i kind of look at the stuff for the intellivision i'm
6524280	6531560	like looks like it could be interesting so maybe yeah all right well let's move on and talk about
6531560	6536600	um loki what you have for us next i'm sorry you just picked up stella too and she's looking all
6536600	6542920	adorable on your shoulder being ready to start screaming at me again oh uh so as we know with
6542920	6548360	games getting bigger and bigger um you know especially with call of duty there's been a lot
6548440	6555800	of different stories about how uh call of duty is too large like their updates are like 150
6555800	6561400	gigabytes it's just ridiculous so now they're saying that there's going to be um some sort of
6561400	6567240	updates done to the pc version that's actually going to let you uninstall portions of the game
6567240	6574680	so apparently you can uninstall 100 gigabytes of stuff the game right now call duty modern warfare
6574680	6585480	on pc it takes up 232 gigabytes of space i mean that's that's ridiculous yeah uh but apparently
6585480	6589480	though is i know one of the things that people have been requesting especially for like even
6589480	6594520	the console versions or um you know talking about what these new consoles coming out even though
6594520	6599320	they have large hard drives i mean like that's like a 20% of your hard drive right there it's
6599320	6604120	ridiculous so they're going to split it up so you can actually uninstall like the campaign
6604120	6610360	multiplayer spec ops that type of stuff so campaign's 35 gigabytes multiplayer is 42
6611000	6616920	spec ops is going to be 38 so you can pretty much like pick your installation size
6617800	6625000	um based on what you want in there which they have to do when the game is that large it's ridiculous
6625000	6629800	yeah that's and especially you know we're looking at we're getting into the new
6629800	6635480	era of gaming with playstation 5 and xbox series x and so on and the drives really didn't get that
6635480	6640200	much bigger like you know i know the xbox is shipping with a one terabyte drive well big
6640200	6645160	fucking deal that's what my xbox one has in it now so and considering we're looking at 4k games
6645160	6651960	so i mean when you talk about a game that's eaten up 250 gigs of that that's that's too much right
6651960	6659960	and well at the very least like with these drives um you can uninstall stuff and also there's the
6659960	6665720	external stuff that you can get for it as well yeah the two terabyte drives that they sell aren't
6665720	6669880	overpriced which is good it is pretty much on par with which you'd pay for
6669880	6676280	that type of storage but they're still expensive yes but you're right they're on par but they're
6676280	6686360	not cheap right so it's just unfortunately it's gonna be you know i i would hope that with this
6686360	6693000	because i know some of these games are a little bit blown up in size because of these slow read
6693000	6699800	speeds or read rate speeds of these um storage devices that they have that they're not able to
6699800	6705160	they have to kind of have redundant information in order to be able to read it quickly and maybe
6705160	6710680	with these drive speeds speeding up to the point where accessing data from any location on the
6710680	6716280	drive is going to be super quick that they can cut down on the redundancies and maybe even compress
6716280	6723080	even more and have you know the dedicated processors to uncompress that as quickly as
6723080	6728920	possible um maybe with that and advancements with their the storage and everything you'll cut down
6728920	6732440	but then you're going to also get higher fidelity graphics which will then offset it back to where
6732440	6739320	we are you know so i don't know i just i hope that they do end up taking options like this
6739320	6744600	when it is unavoidable that the game is going to be this large that at least chunk it up so that
6745400	6751400	if for example i'm not interested in playing special ops i don't have to install that 38
6751400	6758600	gigabyte portion of the file right all right well let's move on and talk about uh some unfortunate
6758680	6764920	news for blizzard is that they recently i think in the week we were off or i can't time is blending
6764920	6769720	together now but they within the past couple weeks uh recently closed their office in france
6769720	6776280	so there was an office in versailles um i say that right thank you versailles uh blizzard
6776280	6780600	recently had to shut their office in versailles down and that means that was 100 of jobs that
6780600	6788520	were lost in the middle of a pandemic nonetheless so in comes some unions to try to uh try to
6789400	6797480	stop this i guess uh so uh some different unions cgt specus unsa and cfe cgc remember we're
6797480	6801640	talking about france so some of those acronyms are actually french uh they're actually saying
6801640	6807800	that blizzard denied they had plans to close the office and they act they say that no blizzard's in
6807800	6813000	fact planning this for a long time and they lied about it uh this comes as a shock for employees
6813000	6817800	who are not expecting this announcement in 15 years many of us left their homes from across
6817800	6822920	europe and beyond to join the company people truly invested their whole lives into blizzard's
6822920	6831080	success so with this uh loss uh 285 jobs are going to be lost with this apparently blizzard
6831080	6837400	had tried to cut 133 jobs in france when they cut the jobs in america because blizzard laid off
6837400	6843160	hundreds in america this last i think it was in 2019 some of y'all might have forgot but the
6843160	6848360	court stopped them so and then they weren't able to do it in march either so maybe because they
6848360	6851640	were stopped to do it i don't know maybe they just said you know what then we're just going
6851640	6858040	to close the office all together uh don't know but unions are demanding blizzard stop the closure
6858040	6865800	develop the europe office and uh invest in prevention of psychosocial risks so um not a lot
6865800	6873800	of good news on that front but it is interesting that um they tried to do some layoffs and were
6873800	6878360	stopped and so now they're just like well fuck it we'll close the whole office that part's kind of
6878360	6884600	interesting um but you know it doesn't seem like blizzard is exactly struggling either they're
6884600	6889000	getting ready to release a big world of warcraft expansion i know that pre-patch went out and it's
6889000	6892920	a pretty big deal it's probably the biggest changes the game has seen since the cataclysm
6892920	6900200	expansion um you know but uh i guess maybe they don't have a new game out yet like nothing on the
6900200	6906360	level of diablo 4 overwatch 2 to really rake things in but i would think during a pandemic
6906360	6910520	this is a time when a lot of game companies are flourishing depending on how they're playing their
6910520	6917960	cards so hmm so we'll see if the unions are able to make anything of this but um i don't know i
6917960	6922280	have a feeling blizzard might have because of what happened previously might have just said you know
6922280	6927080	what it's more cost effective for us to just shut down the whole office um but still my heart goes
6927080	6931960	out to those folks that are affected and uh it's never easy to hear about that especially for that
6931960	6938440	many people so all right well let's move back to a simpler time shall we we're gonna take a step
6938440	6944040	down memory lane and talk a little bit about some classic games so every week dark soccer steps into
6944040	6950520	the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks hey you brats should check this game out it's the
6950520	6959160	classic game of the week so dark sakura what did you find for us this week um i found some dew
6960680	6968520	oh really do mr dew yet again so thank him for that but again a game that i cannot believe we
6968520	6973480	have never featured because i remember playing the shit out of this game at the local yogurt shop
6973480	6977880	because they had to play the dew out of it yes i did they had a cocktail cabinet of this and i
6977880	6983000	used to play it a lot ice plays on the clico all the time yeah my favorite games that was actually
6983000	6986920	something we brought up that there had been the clique of vision version which i i've got too
6988200	6997240	um so yeah mr dew it is a maze arcade game it was uh developed and published by universal in 1982
6997240	7004200	it is the first of the mr dew series and um it would sorry it was also one of the first arcade
7004200	7010200	games to have been released as a conversion kit by taito and it went on to sell 30 000 units in
7010200	7019720	the us um the object well as dan actually was saying earlier it's dig dug on crack um the object
7019720	7024680	is to score as many points by digging tunnels through the ground and collecting cherries
7025560	7030920	mr dew now in the japanese version he was originally a snowman in the us he is a clown
7030920	7036680	which is probably why i am not the biggest fan of of mr dew because i think clowns are scary
7036680	7045000	as crap um but anyway um he is chased by these red monsters called creeps and you lose a life
7045000	7050600	if mr dew gets uh gets caught so the game is over when you've lost your last life easy peasy
7050600	7057800	the cherries are all over um the level in groups of eight um you get 500 points if you collect
7057800	7062760	eight cherries in a row without stopping um the level is complete when you've either collected
7063400	7071080	all the cherries destroyed all the creeps spell extra or you find a diamond um he can defeat the
7071080	7077960	creeps by bouncing a power ball on them and um but he is defenseless while he while the wall is in
7077960	7084840	play you know kind of like when diggy duggy puts out his you know puffy blow thingy that sounded
7084840	7091960	bad anyway um he can also push uh an apple off the edge of a vertical tunnel to crush a creep
7091960	7098840	kind of like in dig dug how you do the you know the the rock um and then the creeps can transform
7098840	7105960	into powerful multi-colored monsters that can travel through the ground and if it digs through
7105960	7110200	a cherry then it leaves fewer cherries and therefore fewer points for mr dew to collect
7110760	7117880	and if it digs under an apple it will and it's suicide or it can uh drop that apple on mr dew
7117880	7124920	and mr dew is apparently allergic to apples and will die um you if you pass the score threshold
7124920	7131240	um uh typically 5000 points a letter for extra will appear on the screen as an apple monster
7131240	7137080	you have to defeat the monster and then you can uh gather uh your letter and um
7137560	7142920	if you collect all five letters and you get a cut scene that plays the the theme to astro boy
7143480	7149400	and you get an extra life um they will eat any apples that they encounter so it makes them
7149400	7155480	very difficult to crush um the creeps will spawn at the center of the screen and after they have
7155480	7161320	all appeared then their generator will turn into a food item so you can get bonus points and freeze
7161960	7169800	the creeps and call up the apple monster and do other stuff um and sometimes dropping an apple
7169800	7174680	will get you a diamond so if you collect it within 15 seconds it lets you skip past the
7174680	7182280	level and you get 8 000 points so you also will then get a free game um it was uh developed by
7182280	7189080	ueda um kazutoshi i don't really know too much about him so there were a bunch of courts of
7189080	7196520	course there was the atari 2600 atari 8-bit uh computer family uh kalika vision as we mentioned
7196520	7209320	before um apple 2 msx neo geo uh tomy tutor and the commodore 64 um there also was a handheld lcd
7209320	7217160	version that was also released by tomy in 1983 now with the kalika version there were some some
7217160	7221000	changes made to it so if you play that one and then go and play the arcade version you're going
7221000	7225880	to notice a little bit difference the alpha monsters and sidekicks are unable to eat apples
7225880	7232040	so they are easier to crush the blue monsters will eat your shrubbery and cherries um also
7232040	7238600	if an alpha monster is over a letter that has already been acquired then the dinosaur monsters
7238600	7249720	will just freeze um so uh in japan um for this uh for sorry the june 15th 1983 issue of game machine
7249720	7258200	mr du was listed as uh the 21st most successful table arcade unit of the year um famicon sushin
7258840	7266680	awarded the super famicon version of this uh 25 out of 40 um and lots of folks for egm thought
7266680	7271320	it was was really great um so yeah as far as those other versions i don't know if i mentioned
7271320	7278360	but yeah there was the uh super famicom snus version um there were other sequels there was
7278360	7288520	mr du's castle in 1983 mr du's wild ride and do run run haha in 1984 there's expanded 99 level
7288520	7293800	version of mr du that was released in arcades by electric coin in 1989 there is a new version
7293800	7301640	called neo mr du uh developed by visco and it was licensed by uh universal for snk neo geo
7301640	7308280	1997 i believe i have played that one um was mr du also edgy like those old xbox arcade games
7309240	7316040	nah it's colorful and bright and pretty um mr du was adapted to the gameboy and super famicon
7316040	7321080	also had different um gameplay features there's a rebranded adaption of the game that came for
7321080	7326040	gameboy color it was called quest fantasy challenge holy magic century in europe
7326040	7331880	developed by imagineer published by sunsoft and uh in for north america and virgin interactive in
7331880	7337240	europe and it's in the quest series of games instead of mr du there the arcade version was
7337240	7346200	on we virtual console in japan and april 27th uh uh 2010 so there you go mr du also a game that
7346200	7352680	had the same name in the u.s in japan how was the sequel not called number two mr duty
7354440	7360360	because some people are grown-ups rob oh okay uh let's see bobby blackwolf in chat says a port is
7360360	7364840	a port of course of course unless that port is all borked of course we call it mr du
7366200	7372200	wamp i remember the commodore 64 version of this because of course i do um and it was uh it was
7372760	7376920	a lot of fun it played a lot like the arcade it's really it's it's harder than dig dug in
7376920	7383000	my opinion like um i'm i'm not bad at dig dug like i can get like more than 10 boards
7383000	7387880	in and dig dug mr du i don't know if i can do that in this game it's it's pretty challenging
7390760	7394760	check out that awesome cut scene they have though right here where uh the extra life is awarded and
7394760	7398760	the little i guess that's a creep a dinosaur i don't know i don't even recognize what that
7398760	7404360	monster is uh waves the red or the white flag i was like why is he trying to attack the uh
7404360	7411720	the dinosaurs from bubble bobble i don't know but it is uh dig dug on crack so did you ever notice
7411720	7415640	as you're collecting the cherries it plays this little sequence if you cool i don't think the guy
7415640	7419880	in the demo we're watching here is doing it fast enough but if you collect the eight cherries it
7419880	7425160	goes do do do do do do do like it does a do re mi all the way and then if you get it all the way
7425160	7429640	the end you actually get like a bonus i always thought that kind of interest that little musical
7429640	7434760	cue was really cute and interesting and something that again i know a lot of people really equate
7434760	7439720	this to dig dug because it is a digging game but they're very different they are very very
7439720	7445480	different in the way they play yeah but there's enough similarity that the the comparison makes
7445480	7453880	sense i like that fifth dream do re mi mr do forget it what if we don't know it makes sense
7453880	7457080	what if we were calling it wrong the whole time and it was mr do
7458200	7465640	it's mr do it's when you read the the kana for it it's do so i guess i believe you all right
7465640	7472120	there it is your classic game of the week mr do uh which i guess was given to us by proxy via dan
7472680	7480120	um but thanks too well and you brought me up you like you've played this before though at least
7480120	7489160	jamie right a couple of times at least on multiple variouses so yeah all right well let's
7489160	7493320	get into some rapid fire news that was a good choice again it was one of those games i'm like
7493320	7499400	how are we 800 plus episodes in and we've never done mr do because i know i i played as shit i'm
7499400	7502600	surprised in one of the weeks you weren't here i didn't pick it but i guess i just never thought
7502600	7508520	of it there you go probably thought it was already chosen before i probably did all right that's
7508520	7514520	that's the joy i did a search for mr do on the page for the classic game i didn't find it i
7514520	7519160	remember having done it i searched for do and there was like 800 results i was like okay i
7519160	7523640	searched for mr and there was one result you picked a mr something else way back when but
7523640	7530600	it wasn't mr do it was something else some other mr mr driller uh maybe probably yeah no i don't
7530600	7534440	even think it was that now i have to go look all right well anyway uh let's move on though we got
7534440	7539480	some rapid fire news coming your way so loki start us off please yeah so this is kind of
7539480	7545640	interesting so uh sorry mr important update mr mosquito was the game thank you no one special
7546520	7554520	yeah yeah now i remember yeah um sega has decided to release a prototype version of a cancelled
7554520	7563800	golden axe game um for their sega 60th anniversary um calling it golden axe a cancelled prototype
7564520	7570600	um apparently it was a game that's being developed by sega studios australia back in 2013
7571400	7581800	and it's a 2.5d remake of the classic series the it's kind of being met with mixed uh reception
7581800	7588760	because the game itself while it was cancelled apparently while it was in development was under
7588840	7596040	a lot of crunch and so it's bringing up uh bad memories from that but it is interesting to be
7596040	7601320	able to check out something that it was um in development at one time if you want to check it
7601320	7607640	out for free you can find it on steam um and it actually got released today for a limited time
7607640	7613560	so go check it out while you can neat um i wish they maybe were a little more respectful in how
7613560	7618120	they went about doing it but i think it's cool that like companies are willing to put out these
7618200	7622120	you know demos and products that didn't really see the light of day i think it's pretty cool
7623080	7628920	yeah um and then of course i've been looking forward to a minecraft movie but unfortunately
7628920	7633480	that's not going to be coming out anytime soon release has been pushed back for the foreseeable
7633480	7640840	future so originally it's supposed to be coming out in 2022 however the latest release from
7640840	7647640	warner brothers their production schedule does not now list it on um their production schedule as a
7647640	7652440	movie that will be coming out in the near future here um of course you know they have other movies
7652440	7659160	that are coming out as well a fourth matrix movie the new suicide squad the batman dune black adam
7659160	7665800	so there's a lot on their plate and unfortunately minecraft is not part of that as of right now
7666440	7670360	why not god you think there's a pandemic going on or you would think you would think you'd be
7670360	7677240	a good idea but i don't know hopefully it's still popular in a few years movies are a little harder
7677240	7683960	to make right now i guess especially when they're well too so oh that'd be a little less i would
7683960	7688360	think but i don't know i hope it's not live action that would be terrible no i think it's an anime
7688360	7694840	movie actually having followed a couple of behind the scenes just for current tv production um they
7694840	7699880	have some crazy rules that they have to follow to maintain safe uh safety on set and quarantine so
7700600	7705720	that would make sense for any kind of movie filming especially anything that's uh that's uh
7705720	7709640	studio based you know what i mean instead of a location and i don't think i talked about an
7709640	7714600	olr but i did an indie movie actually it's it's it's like a um it's like a film festival it's
7714600	7719880	gonna be online but i did uh a thing so i had to do a movie set basically uh it was that you know
7719880	7724840	small indie type of thing but still so uh and that was during all this that was just uh about
7724840	7729960	a month ago that i did that so because i think that's coming out next week and honestly it could
7729960	7735320	be that i don't know like what you know just because it's not listed now doesn't mean maybe
7735480	7740920	they just don't know where it's gonna go yet um the furthest date out that they have right now
7740920	7748840	is shazam fury of the gods which is uh moving from november 4 2022 to june 2nd 2023 um
7750280	7757160	so i mean it still could be somewhere they just don't have a date for it yet i mean i don't know
7757160	7763000	we'll we'll see i mean it's still a long ways out anyways even if it wasn't being delayed all right
7763000	7767640	well moving on to talk about xbox game pass and some pretty interesting additions coming to that
7767640	7772840	uh lucasfilm uh or excuse me not lucasfilm lucasarts which you know is part of that i guess
7772840	7780200	but lucas art remastered classics uh are coming to xbox game pass so sadly not the actual classics
7780200	7786200	that would have been rad on pc game pass uh but we get the remasters which are cool in their own
7786200	7792520	own right so we're getting full throttle grim fandango and day of the tentacle um so you can
7792520	7798680	play these remasters on xbox pc or android with cloud syncing and all that cool stuff um so yeah
7798680	7803640	these games of course all originally came out in the 1990s but then they were redone later on when
7803640	7807800	double fine entertainment bought the rights to those titles and went on to remaster them
7807800	7813640	uh microsoft of course remember bought double fine remember that so this is those rewards
7813640	7819080	coming back now so uh yeah there you go these games are going to be hitting game pass on october 29th
7819720	7823640	i'll i'll be checking them out for sure because i think i played i think i played the day of
7823640	7827320	the tentacle but that was the only one i checked out so i want to check out the other ones uh for
7827320	7834920	sure and uh in a bit of a developer shuffle around uh changing news uh crackdown 2 the developers
7834920	7842280	behind that game ruffian games is now operating as rockstar dun d because they are joining
7842280	7847560	uh all the other rockstar studios i don't know what they're working on but you can imagine that
7847640	7855320	crackdown 2 was some would say the last decent crackdown game oh so right loki i mean it was
7856680	7862840	unfortunately that that is a true statement yeah so uh who knows what they're doing uh this studio
7862840	7867720	though they had ported and remastered the old halo games so maybe they're making sure that
7867720	7872760	grand theft auto 5 is running on new consoles or maybe red dead redemption um who knows or maybe
7872760	7876280	they are going to be working on something we've been working on the agent game that we've been
7876280	7882840	promised for decades oh god right uh and and who knows maybe they're working on something new
7882840	7886840	that's kind of inspired by crackdown series a little bit like you know they could kind of do
7886840	7892520	something a little different so who knows finally get the sequel to rockstar's table tennis it's
7892520	7899560	coming hey that game was awesome all right dar sagra what do you have i have a mute button
7899560	7905800	apparently um but also um a little bit more news about um rock band 4 it's going to be
7905800	7916520	a completely compatible with ps5 and xbox series x um it is uh basically you know they're wanting
7916520	7921320	to keep it up to date so that they can keep playing it with the newer ones and then of course
7921320	7927080	there is uh all of those licenses that people are dealing with though from having their earlier
7927080	7933880	versions um and they're saying that of course all of their uh their controllers that came out
7933880	7939400	apparently all of it is supposed to work on the new stuff as well um and then they are working
7939400	7946760	on cleaner transfer for the dlc um information um so that it's supposed to be a lot easier than
7946760	7953480	it was um and then uh the license for rock bands three songs going to rock band four expires on
7953480	7959800	december 1st so you have one last chance to get that but you need the rock band three disc and
7959800	7967720	then sorry sorry about it sorry not sorry um in other news um and you might not be surprised to

8245480	8251240	cart and a goat that's shrieking as you go through the supermarket it's on game pass
8251240	8256840	yeah yeah speaking of which um i did want to mention supermarkets we've got relaunched i
8256840	8261240	guess today that was tonight it was it's up against our show so stop reminding the viewers
8261240	8266920	they have something else to go watch but yes that is that did start tonight you know what i finally
8266920	8272760	watched too um while i was on my little trip number one i finally finished all four seasons
8272760	8279000	of the good place finally which was finally well worth it it was such a good show i highly
8279000	8284440	recommend it um and then i also finally saw the pressure luck revival i hadn't seen it this whole
8284440	8288280	time i just you know i'm always playing games or whatever um so i finally sat down watch that
8288280	8293320	because i i watched an episode some guy almost won the whole thing like won a million bucks or
8293320	8298680	something is there another one um yeah they relaunched pressure luck uh last year i think
8298680	8304120	and it's um what's her name effy trinket in hunger games she hosts it elizabeth banks
8305160	8311080	before right oh yeah like in the 2000 era the whammy no no that was terrible this one the
8311080	8316440	nice thing about this one this brings back like it's the it does what a lot of the abc shows do
8316440	8321560	and it brings back the same set and the whammies and little cartoon animations in the 80s but they
8321560	8326840	made them new things but they're still that same style so they kept everything that works and
8326840	8331240	obviously they had to change the host because peter tamarkin you know died um so they changed
8331240	8337080	the host but elizabeth banks she works she did a good job so cool okay yeah reda repulsa also was
8337080	8344680	her big role so um yeah that was good i saw that and uh yeah the supermarket sweep is leslie jones
8344680	8351560	which love her i can't see how that's bad uh card sharks joel mchale was on tonight too oh lord
8351560	8356440	yeah so they've been reviving a lot of the old game shows it's pretty interesting and then um
8356600	8363560	also saw the weakest link came back on nbc but it's not um ann robinson and she was so good there
8363560	8371320	they have um what's her name the the chick from glee uh jay linch is the host now yeah she's cool
8371320	8377800	like i like her but it's it's it's her her um i think ann robinson really worked on the weakest
8377800	8382840	link because she was a bit of an unknown especially here in america but jane lynch
8382840	8388920	there's something about her demeanor where it feels like she's playing a character and she's
8388920	8393880	good she plays a good character but it just kind of feels like she's playing that mean teacher on
8393880	8399640	glee as a game show host and so it's kind of weird i don't know but anyway yeah and that's my that's
8399640	8409480	my opinion on game shows all right let's move on uh more uh more topics logi all right um so not
8409480	8415800	surprising because it hasn't been doing too well but apparently the next-gen versions of marvel's
8415800	8422200	avengers have been delayed uh because apparently crystal dynamics is working on issues with the
8422200	8429000	game you may not know they're only they were down to a thousand players concurrent recently on the
8429000	8436120	pc version of that game oh wow so it's just it hasn't really been delivering the promise that
8436120	8441720	they were making of the game so because of that of course um they are now going back to retool
8441720	8446200	some of that stuff they said they want to deliver an extra experience showcasing all that this game
8446200	8452600	is meant to be and uh apparently along with that they're going to be throwing in some
8453480	8460280	bonuses for players that already have the game as well um fifth dream in our chat says yeah
8460280	8465080	it's a buggy mess and not fun that's too bad because crystal dynamics really knocked it out
8465080	8469640	of the park with um the tomb raider games so i don't know was it was this just rushed like
8469640	8474280	they just didn't have enough time to really put the polish on it you know needed i think it's
8474280	8479880	just because they're trying to shoehorn it into a um live service game whereas it looks like this
8479880	8485720	would play more as a single player story driven game which is kind of what they're used to is a
8485720	8493000	lot of those um single player story driven games um but now they're making them it's anthem all
8493000	8498920	over again i mean look you've got the you've got a studio that's been um experienced has experience
8498920	8505080	in making a certain type of game and now you're forcing them to make a game that's a live service
8505080	8511880	game because money and how did that turn out it turned out well for anthem and it didn't turn out
8511880	8517880	well for this so it's just i think i saw hopefully we'll be like i think i saw anthem like seven
8517880	8523320	bucks on the shelf at target the other day and i was like it's still too much it hopefully will
8523320	8532280	yeah it'll hopefully um get better with time but like sometimes they just give up so yeah it
8532280	8539320	depends like with anthem yeah you can rescue a game we've seen many cases now there's been several
8539320	8545480	where a game has completely turned around and fixed what was a problem launch diablo 3 final
8545480	8550680	fantasy 14 no man's sky you know there's there and there's more that you can probably add to
8550680	8556200	this list you know so the avengers isn't like completely fucked like it can still turn around
8556200	8560920	but you're right the developer and the publisher have to kind of commit to turning it around
8560920	8565960	and you know what we saw like hello games doing with no man's sky that shit is unprecedented
8565960	8571320	like the amount of shit that that game got and the amount that the developers have stuck to it to
8571320	8577240	really turn it around and i mean really turn it around is really unprecedented so i mean it's not
8577240	8584520	it's they could do it it's just will crystal and square and all that be able to have the resources
8584520	8592600	to do it the good news is square enix final fantasy 14 probably the biggest example of a
8592600	8597560	turnaround and not just a turnaround but a turnaround that resulted in profit big profit
8597560	8602680	that game is making square a lot of money so that's the good news we're not talking about
8602680	8607960	ea now with anthem we're talking about square enix and they've turned around the game before
8607960	8613640	so it's possible so not all this news necessarily has to be bad well i understand that but like
8614200	8618600	an mmo and a live service game like this are kind of a little bit different in the sense i think with
8618600	8625720	an mmo mmo you have a lot more content to consume whereas this game it's kind of grinding the same
8625720	8630200	missions over and over and over again for experience not only that though with an mmo
8630920	8635320	i mean you have your monthly fee that you're paying to this they don't have that kind of
8635320	8641800	laid out here so instead they have all these different like passes that you can purchase to
8642360	8648440	bought upgrade each individual character is a separate pass it's just it's monetized the hell
8648440	8655240	and so it it's just it's greedy they see it working with like fortnite and stuff like that
8655240	8660200	but they have to realize that that's a free to play game like it's different you can't charge
8660200	8665160	people up for it 60 fee and then like oh but by the way we want more of your money a ton more of
8665160	8673880	your money um it's just i don't know when they're gonna learn that this is not a a smart way to go
8677000	8682200	akuma jp in chat says final fantasy is squares bread but avengers is not no true and you know
8682200	8688920	final fantasy really stuck to we are going to charge a monthly fee for this mmo excuse me
8691080	8695080	sorry hiccups um and they're only they're one of two companies still in the business
8695080	8699160	or that do that that are still in the business of that them and blizzard with wow are the only
8699160	8703000	ones that are still charging a monthly fee to play their game everybody else went free to play
8703000	8706920	and there was a lot of pressure for for final fantasy 14 i think to go free to play and well
8706920	8711800	actually they have a really robust free to play experience now essentially uh squares take on it
8712600	8717480	the first two expansions so the base realm reborn and heavensward are now just free
8717480	8722440	you could just go play those if you want uh if you want to play the newer stuff like uh storm
8722440	8726920	blood and shadow bringers then you have to start paying but they're they're offering a lot for free
8726920	8733160	now it's pretty interesting so yeah uh questbuster says loki hit on another thing that irked me
8733160	8738840	every tune had to be leveled up separately uh at least in ultimate alliance i could expect my tunes
8738840	8743800	to somewhat keep with me regardless of whether i had them in my party or not but no let's not
8743800	8750360	respect the player's time uh she hulk 10 says they should just make a great hulk game now
8750360	8752920	why would she hulk won a great hulk game
8755320	8762680	but no i think the hulk is it's a secret to everybody there you go there you go that would
8762680	8767880	be that's right i'm sorry disney doesn't make games anymore you need to aim higher aim higher
8767880	8773160	go for the she-hole game all right okay and the follow-up comment or she hulk game
8774840	8780280	all right i'll take it all right uh let's move on let's talk about the playstation 5 interface
8780280	8785160	because sony actually showed off the playstation 5 interface this week so we got to see a little
8785160	8789080	more about it um i'm gonna be honest it was like a 20-minute video and i didn't watch the whole
8789080	8796200	thing i don't know if you guys did uh loki or what have you um no but basically okay it has
8796200	8800280	some similarities to what we've seen before although of course now it runs in 4k but you
8800280	8806440	also have quick access to things like help um you also have the game milestones and how close you
8806440	8812280	are to certain achievements uh and trophies or whatever are embedded within the game you can see
8812280	8817960	the progress on the various levels and quests but you can also see guides and hints if you have a
8817960	8823080	playstation plus membership so you can kind of get an idea of where is this or how do i do this that's
8823080	8827320	kind of interesting how they're embedding that in there instead of uh and really cutting into
8827320	8832280	the youtube market for that kind of stuff except yeah i was gonna say except you you do realize
8832280	8837640	you have a console with youtube and probably a web browser in there and everybody has a phone
8837640	8843560	and the internet what don't you all have phones no i'm still i but just like yes the console has
8843560	8846920	youtube but you have to go out of what you're playing to go look at youtube but you're right
8846920	8850760	the phones are the way a lot of people and like i don't understand like it's gonna be much i
8850920	8856600	um whatever you know what because do whatever whatever you want to say to like the answer
8856600	8861640	is simple the answer is simple why would sony want you to go out to youtube to watch a video
8862280	8866680	when that you could watch their video which someday will have an ad just like youtube
8867720	8872280	no it's because it's not even that at all it's because they just want to bring some more value
8872280	8879640	to their playstation plus service that is severely lacking new value is what they're trying to do
8880280	8888040	all right it's fine no one's gonna use it like no one uses probably the uh whatever they call
8888040	8892120	it where they you know posting screenshots and stuff internally within playstation
8892120	8897800	i don't think i ever look at that stuff but it's there now some things that are also worth pointing
8897800	8902600	out and i think these are really cool you can now do voice dictation for chat so if you don't
8902600	8906280	so you have to sit there trying to type a message you can just say it into the controller's
8906280	8911800	microphone and it will hopefully uh dictate the message about as well as your smartphone does
8911800	8915960	so that's you know it'll dictate it incorrectly which will then get picked up by the other
8915960	8921880	algorithm that says that you're a terrorist and then you need lost access to all your uh content
8921880	8926920	so uh you can also send messages with spoiler warnings so if you're gonna send an image that's
8926920	8930920	late in the game you can have it with a spoiler warning so that way it doesn't ruin it for somebody
8930920	8936440	that's um a good thought and a good way of planning that out um there's always an explore
8936440	8941320	section that has kind of a mix of things from playstation games the community i kind of thought
8941320	8945400	playstation 4 kind of already has that but it's kind of clunky and i don't know if that's just
8945400	8949560	because the the age of the playstation 4 system or whatever but it's getting a little clunky
8949560	8954600	uh and the playstation 5 is is definitely moving a little bit faster so that's um it's kind of
8954600	8959560	interesting so it's not really a complete reinvention of the wheel but you know and i
8959560	8965160	noticed in chat act f says the thing that caught my eye the most is how fast the interface runs
8965160	8969640	and i think it is that that nice kind of like quick access stuff you know especially moving to
8969640	8974600	the solid state drive that's a big chunk of what microsoft has going for it too so i think that'll
8974600	8980360	be well received no all right let's move on just a few more stories for you guys then we're going
8980360	8984120	to get to listener roundtable i know we at least have a couple emails tonight so let's get through
8984120	8990440	these last few stories dark sakura well the writer of silent hill shattered memories is
8990440	8999880	pitching a sequel um uh sam barlow who was the one behind that in 2009 um really wants to do
9000440	9008200	something else with silent hill um right now it's just uh pitched as project a um and i'm sorry
9008200	9012680	it's not project a which is something he's developing with half mermaid studios it's
9012680	9018840	something completely different um and it doesn't um necessarily mean that it's gonna be picked up
9018840	9025560	but he's really pushing for it and it could have some subtraction so we'll see um i didn't remember
9025560	9032120	that as being the greatest in the line of silent hill games but anything that gets us more silent
9032120	9042120	hill makes me pretty happy so we'll see cool yeah hopefully they don't screw it up yeah
9043400	9050600	don't fuck it up i just want some silent hill i know it's time for that series to come back
9050600	9056600	already right right it'll never be as good as you want it to be pixel pakas also points out
9056600	9060920	sam barlow is the one that worked on her story and telling lies and telling lies was that game
9060920	9066200	i talked about a few weeks ago um that i thought was really cool what's that yeah her story was
9066280	9072840	pretty okay too did you play telling lies no oh you should it's it's cool like it's it's
9072840	9077160	it's like her story it's it's the whole you're looking through video to find things it's great
9077720	9086840	so yeah all right um let's move on loki so this is to be expected but apparently nintendo has gone
9086840	9097640	after um a tick tock um user by the name of poke princess um who had 1.9 million followers
9098280	9105800	now you may be asking well why would they do that well a few reasons number one um she calls herself
9105800	9115480	poke princess poke of course referring to pokemon um she sells merchandise featuring mu and poke
9115480	9123160	balls which don't believe that she has the express permission to do and also um being that she is
9123160	9129560	representing herself with poke in her name probably her only fans page is not something
9129560	9136040	that they would like to have associated with their nintendo brand so they have filed a suit
9136040	9142200	against her and gotten her to change her name now to digital princess maybe she just likes fish
9142440	9148600	okay is delicious yeah but she she's she's got like merchandise that has mu on it i mean it's
9148600	9153880	like i'm joking really yeah no yeah and that that is the real problem you know i think there's a
9153880	9158680	narrative out there about nintendo doesn't appreciate that she does adult content and all
9158680	9165800	this stuff i don't think that is the issue the issue is the merchandise at the end of the day
9165800	9171480	that's what they have a problem with it's probably the merchandise scott garnered the attention
9172440	9179560	and the rest was just not you know they can't even if she was like family-friendly wholesome
9179560	9185160	and stuff like that you can't sell merch with their branding themselves yeah that's
9185960	9192600	and obviously the adult element of it it does and i again i don't want to slut shame sex industry
9192600	9197240	worker shame any of that stuff on here like you know uh there's lots of people out there
9197240	9201160	especially in these pandemic times that are looking to things like only fans to kind of
9201160	9205720	you know carry it and i it's fine you know you got to make a living where you can make a living
9205720	9211560	uh in the world's you know in a profession that works for a lot of people um well in
9212200	9219160	i was gonna say the i just think nintendo doesn't want to even remember they shut down
9219160	9226120	picto chat because it was possible to send a dick pic to somebody they shut it down for everybody
9226120	9232680	like they don't even want to have it inferred that pokemon is mixed with adult entertainment
9232680	9237240	they don't even want to take that risk but the merchandise at the end of the day is the biggest
9237240	9242840	problem yeah and she's she's basically saying you know nintendo doesn't want people to think i'm in
9242840	9246840	any way shape or form affiliated with them or that i have a partnership with them it all comes down
9246840	9252040	to me being an adult entertainer it says nintendo's a family-friendly company so they don't want to
9252040	9257160	ruin their reputation or anything if people think that me and them are affiliated obviously
9257160	9260760	really sucks from a business standpoint i have to understand it and accept it because i fucked up
9261800	9267960	so um i still love nintendo and will forever support them well that's a at least that's a nice
9269400	9275400	thing to make sure the lawyers get off her back but it's nice it is it is nice yeah so all right
9275400	9279640	well best of luck to digi princess and you know what it's you can rebrand yourself and still be
9279640	9283320	successful and especially with the number of followers she has i feel like she's gonna be
9283320	9287400	she's gonna be okay she just needs to come up with new new new merch but it'll be all right
9288680	9295640	all right let's move on one more story tonight that has to do with starcraft 2 or lack thereof
9295640	9299720	i don't mean to be dumping on blizzard tonight sorry i just had two articles about them but
9299720	9304680	uh blizzard is pretty much done with starcraft 2 this is of course right on the heels of the game's
9305240	9310600	10th anniversary blizzard has announced they're going to be moving away from making new content
9310600	9318280	for starcraft 2 and focusing on what's next without saying starcraft 3 but i mean hello
9318280	9325160	we're not saying we're not saying starcraft 3 but starcraft 3 anyway uh no more uh for purchase in
9325160	9330840	game content no more expansions for starcraft 2 they will still do season roles they'll do
9330840	9335960	balance fixes for the fans and the competitive players uh and you know they're saying esports
9335960	9340200	is still going strong i mean well shit the original starcraft esports is still going strong
9340200	9346040	so uh yeah i wouldn't expect that that's gonna go away um but that's that's it and if you missed it
9346040	9350280	starcraft 2 did get a big update for the 10th anniversary so it did go out with a bang
9350280	9356840	so in july there were new achievements prestige talents and gameplay improvements um with that so
9356840	9361400	um it's not that you know the game's been supported a lot longer than most games get
9361400	9368920	supported so there is that ssj100 matt in chat says or more likely starcraft the mobile spin-off
9368920	9375800	game you shut your mouth and you don't speak that into existence where every gamer has a voice
9375800	9383080	except you with that comment i'm just kidding all right let's get into speaking of which let's get
9383080	9388040	into the listener round table uh if you have some questions for us in chat or something you wanted

9438040	9442680	religiously since 2005 but i'm a bit shy to join the live shows preferring to enjoy the show bit
9442680	9447800	by bit throughout my work week don't judge me please no not judging you no totally not judging
9447800	9453800	you but at the same time we don't bite like so you know i do well here's the thing let me let
9453800	9458520	me let me try to meet you halfway just come on sunday night and lurk in the chat because i'm
9458520	9463880	telling you we're too busy multitasking i have no idea who's watching i can see right now live on
9463880	9469160	twitch there's 34 watching and maybe 10 active in chat so i know there's people that just have this
9469160	9474920	on and you're doing other things and that's a-okay like i i'm not that and that's the only time and
9474920	9479160	as far as i'm going to go to call out lurkers because i know i like to watch certain twitch
9479160	9483560	channels and i just sit there and don't say anything i just have it on in the background
9483560	9487880	because it's it's kind of like my background thing going on right now so i do want to just say
9487880	9493320	don't be don't be scared if you want to come live sunday night but at the same time totally don't i
9493320	9498280	mean that's why we do a podcast so that you can listen throughout the week so if that's how you
9498280	9506680	want to do it that is totally fine so um uh i just wanted to bring all of the listeners attention to
9506680	9511720	a wonderful hidden gem i just discovered on the nintendo e shop called hunt down the only way i
9511720	9517560	can describe it as a final fight neon samurai and narc had a baby and it was raised by quentin
9517560	9523480	tarantino in a dingy arcade it's hilarious and rocklessly fun trust me the trailer alone will
9523480	9527880	sell you on it there's a link to it but i think everyone can find it um this got me thinking when
9527880	9531320	was the last time you discovered a game that you had never heard of and enjoyed so much that you
9531320	9536840	can't believe it never gained mass popularity hunt down definitely fits the bill to me and i'd love
9536840	9541800	to know your thoughts on this topic back to lurking for me thank you all for all you do and the voices
9541800	9547560	you bring to the community i appreciate you signed tonic vision i appreciate that email
9547560	9556040	very much thank you you remember well me talking about um patterned i really like patterned um and
9556680	9564520	there was that other game that i used to play that was like hex based puzzles and gosh why can't i
9564520	9571160	think of it for anymore because i really loved it um but lately it was it's patterned for me
9571160	9576120	i really like patterned um i think in the modern type of games you know i'm kind of stealing
9576120	9581400	something that maybe loki would say but orna just because you know considering it's like a
9581400	9587560	old school rpg mixed with pokemon go it there are the real world elements of that kind of surprised
9587560	9592200	more people aren't talking about that game um but i also like being able to control as many
9592200	9597400	territories as i do so maybe i'm okay with that being a little more underground i go back like
9597400	9602680	way back to classics actually when i first kind of read that question my brain went to um like
9602680	9607400	probably the biggest oversight of all time and dark soccer i know you're gonna agree with me
9607400	9614760	on this the guardian legend that was a game that like deserves way more recognition and um
9615400	9620280	support than i think it got especially at the time i think it's one of those things now that
9620280	9624680	there's definitely a cult audience for it and words gotten out i think with time but i think
9624680	9629080	that would be one and then maybe i'm just in a retro mood or something but i also think of a
9629080	9636760	game like uh crystalis i don't think was super huge at the time but it was so so good for like
9636760	9643560	a zelda ish type of game on the nes um that was a game i remember enjoying the shit out of when i
9643560	9648840	was a kid not a lot of people were super into that so um some comments coming in from our chat room
9648920	9655240	including uh shane is back saying uh roundabout is that game that's the one with the limo that
9655240	9662200	just spins over and over and the cutscenes are so bad but like i know and flaco love that game too
9662200	9665400	they both were talking about how much they love roundabout and i'm like or as i call it
9665400	9673480	runeboot and i i don't think it's i don't think it's that funny but okay whatever it's okay but
9673640	9682360	it ends up getting old pretty fast okay um yeah this is folks in chat some some are saying
9682360	9687480	roundabout is amazing uh some are saying round about the game not the song from yes all right
9687480	9694200	anyway uh great question and great email thanks so much for that then our other one uh comes uh
9694200	9700840	well you'll be able to tell the moment that i start the email so hello lr oh yeah i'm all
9700840	9707080	caught up on past episodes thanks for taking a week off that helped so i'm now able to actually
9707080	9712120	comment on something mentioned during the last episode regarding sony's decision to universally
9712120	9718360	make x the confirm button and o the cancel button across all regions including japan at least one of
9718360	9723560	you pointed out the accessibility feature that allows you to remap buttons however you want
9723560	9729720	unfortunately this is not a good solution because this changes literally all functions of the button
9729720	9734840	not just functions pertaining to menu selections for example if the game uses x as a jump button
9734840	9741080	as other games often do the jump button would now be on oh and while many games have their own
9741080	9745960	button config functions you'll also be dealing with many games having their own but you'll also
9745960	9751480	be dealing with incorrect on-screen prompts and the headache of having to remap buttons in literally
9751480	9756200	every game you play the correct way of handling this would be to give users the option of which
9756200	9761960	button they want to confirm or cancel heck this option could be rolled out worldwide i suppose
9761960	9766840	time will tell but i really don't see why this shouldn't be a thing thanks as usual for this
9766840	9773000	show and have a great week erin yyr um great solution to the problem and i i really have
9773000	9778360	nothing else to add thank you for the email it's great uh yeah should be just baked into the os but
9778360	9781640	you're right you brought up a good point it's going to change other things those buttons use
9781640	9786600	too that maybe is unintended so yeah good good way of framing that all right uh now before i
9786600	9792520	get bobby really wants to hear this email so i'm going to do chat questions first all right uh just
9792520	9797880	a quick a couple quick ones from chat sg100 matt says uh today is the 35th anniversary of the nes
9797880	9802920	coming out in north america do you remember the day you got the nes and what were the first few
9802920	9809080	games you got aside from super mario brothers yes i do i did not have super mario brothers
9809800	9815960	that's my first fee i think we talked about this last week so yeah so my uh three games there
9815960	9823240	because we got it second hand so i had breakthrough bubble bobble and the legend of zelda nice uh my
9823240	9830760	nes came from sears and it was because i did such a good job uh getting straight a's on my report
9830760	9836200	card that my mom said okay we can get one because you got straight a's uh and so i bought it and of
9836280	9840200	course i had the mario brothers dot com but i also had to get the game that everybody was
9840200	9846520	talking about at school and that was the legend of zelda don't regret that purchase jamie mine
9846520	9854280	came from my dad and i have no idea where he bought it um i when i got mine he also got me
9854280	9864040	tetris um and i had uh i've done the game before sky shark which was like my probably one of my
9864040	9870280	earliest shooters that i played and i absolutely loved it um and later on i was given some games
9870280	9875400	by my mom's friend ashley who you know rest in peace she's no longer with with us for years um
9875960	9880680	this is the same lady who told no one she was pregnant didn't change any of her clothes for
9880680	9884840	her entire pregnancy and her own mother found out when she was giving birth in the bathroom
9884840	9891800	just leave that there wow so she gave me all of her games after she had her baby um and among them
9891800	9901000	was the guardian legend nice nice so yep uh dj rama s in chat says non-gaming question are you
9901000	9905080	ready for supermarket sweep tonight you must have left the room because we had a game show tangent
9905080	9910600	not that long ago but um short answer yes but will i actually getting around to watching it
9910600	9916280	like on hulu or whatever uh to be determined if i can pull myself away from my games long enough
9916280	9920600	because i only just that just this last week finally watched the pressure lock reboot
9920600	9927320	so i'm a little slow sometimes leave me alone all right uh let's see other questions here um
9928200	9934200	no one special says uh okay it's basically halloween season that being said is there a game
9934200	9939240	that has a horror vibe be it an old resident evil or silent hill game nightmare creatures or
9939240	9943160	whatever that would be a good fit for the halloween season that you've always liked
9943160	9948200	playing right around halloween as a sort of tradition of sorts personally i've always
9948200	9954040	enjoyed playing the first three resident evil games and or nightmare creatures anyone want to
9954040	9960200	take that i mean aside from the game in my background but that hasn't really been too recent
9960200	9969080	so yeah i will probably oh go ahead um i i've just i like final home i've played that a couple
9969080	9975960	times it out um you know don't not really i will probably be exposed to plenty of debt by daylight
9975960	9980760	thanks to my husband um i'm not huge on the scary games you guys know that i mean i do like silent
9980760	9985400	hill and stuff but i probably won't do a full replay um i like to use the halloween season
9985400	9992200	to celebrate campy horror movies um so i will probably watch the adams family uh elvira mistress
9992200	9998520	of the dark is a must this time of year uh showgirls is uh one that uh i wish jamie and i could
9998520	10004440	get together and watch uh but uh you know things are what they are but i like i like to use this
10004440	10011320	time of year to do uh scary uh horror movies not not scary but like campy i love the campy sleep
10011320	10018840	sleepaway camp um i'm trying to get other stuff that's like super camp that's yeah anyway uh
10018840	10025400	let's see other comments in chats um act f says what is a game that you've played where you've
10025400	10033480	liked most if not every single main or secondary character in it what is a game where you liked
10033480	10047400	every single character in it um um um mass effect i mean that's kind of where my head goes um
10048280	10054760	keep in mind i hated cadent first just saying yeah but he said you could most he said most was
10054760	10060360	okay are we referring so we're referring to main characters um i actually really do enjoy a lot of
10060360	10067800	the resident evil characters um i enjoy uh i mean certainly most of the final fantasy characters i
10067800	10073800	really enjoyed them i would say fantasy 13 and even with hope and venille you grow to really
10073800	10081160	like them towards the end um and especially in uh 13 2 i think hope is uh really cool so um i think
10081160	10086120	that's a good one too in my opinion and uh yeah i was thinking of this one too shane in chat gives
10086120	10090680	the answer i'm not as surprised to hear at all saying hades and yeah as far as like recent stuff
10090680	10095320	goes um all the characters in hades are so dreamy there's something about that game
10096760	10103480	there's something about that game so good uh loki anything for you where you enjoyed all
10103480	10112920	um say like final fantasy 6 or that's a good one um maybe like one of the grand theft auto
10112920	10120680	games i can't see four because roman was a pain in the ass um maybe five
10122600	10129560	um you know on twitter when people say um i'm h word on maine they mean hades all right uh
10129560	10136040	let's see moving on to one more question here that is um oh i thought we had another one nope i think
10136040	10141480	i got everything if you if we didn't get your question just repost it okay uh because i missed
10141560	10146120	it but now i will read the spam email but i'm gonna omit the name of the company because i'm
