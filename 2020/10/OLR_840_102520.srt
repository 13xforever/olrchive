00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,160
This week, Twitch gets bigger and legal pressure gets stronger.

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,080
Long known to be a source of contention, copyrighted music on streams has become a large content

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,600
liability with Twitch choosing to delete large amounts of archived content from streamers'

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,600
channels where copyrighted music was present.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,600
This is a complicated subject that I can't properly express in 20 seconds alone, so I'm

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,600
turning it over to your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to discuss this and

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,560
all the night's news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:45,600
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,080
where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:56,680
It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again tonight with episode number 840 of our show.

11
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,320
For this October the 25th of 2020, my name is Rob Roberts, and I'm joined as always by

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,480
my co-hosts.

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,400
Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,400
Hey.

15
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Hey, Jamie.

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
How you doing?

17
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
I'm all right.

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Yeah?

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
I'm in-

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,040
Well, I'll be honest, headache, but I'm here.

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,040
You're here.

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,040
All right.

23
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,040
Well, appreciate-

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,160
There's no bright glowy circle halo like usual.

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,160
That's okay.

26
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,160
That's okay.

27
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,160
It's all right.

28
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,920
But anyway, so it's okay for things to be dark and a little bit moody tonight, I suppose.

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,920
Moody?

30
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,520
Well, yeah, that would be me.

31
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,920
I'm trying to pick out everything on your shelf too, and I'm having a hard time.

32
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,920
Okay.

33
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,920
So I have my mini Impala from Supernatural.

34
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,920
All right.

35
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,800
I have my Sam Pop.

36
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,800
I have P-P-Puddin, Parappa, there's a Magikarp back there, I have a weighted companion cube,

37
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,480
and my pumpkin because it is Halloween-y.

38
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,480
All right.

39
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,480
Well, unfortunately-

40
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,600
I'm enjoying my Supernatural love because the show is almost over.

41
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,960
For those that are listening on our podcast feed, they can't see all that stuff on video,

42
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,320
but it's just incentive to try to be here when we record live Sunday nights at six o'clock

43
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,280
Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at twitch.tv slash vog network, The Voice of Geeks network,

44
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,340
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

45
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,600
So we are live on Sunday nights.

46
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,280
And if you're a subscriber here on our Twitch feed, which I think you can pay five bucks

47
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:27,520
for, or you can use your free Amazon Prime subscription that will give you one free Twitch

48
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,520
sub a month.

49
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,720
You can use that, and that will allow you to access all the video on demand.

50
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,320
So if you're listening at home on your podcast feed right now through Spotify or something,

51
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,520
and you're like, I want to see Dark Sakura's recording space, you can hit up the Twitch

52
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,860
channel and check that out.

53
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,160
Also joining us, of course, as he is every week, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

54
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,160
Hello.

55
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,160
Hey, Loki.

56
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,160
How are you doing?

57
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,640
I'm doing fine.

58
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,160
And I see the listeners who are participating live tonight with us have recognized the game

59
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,000
behind you as Carrion, that game that came out not that long ago.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,040
Is this something you've been playing lately or?

61
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,280
No, I just I have to think of a Halloween game and I could have done the other one.

62
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,920
I was kind of going with thought about Friday the 13th from the NES, but I was like, yeah,

63
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,920
that's a good one.

64
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,800
I'm sure we've done that before, but probably I haven't really played much.

65
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,200
I haven't really played any of this game, but I know that that they have as part of

66
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,120
that Devolver Digital E3 game thing that they did.

67
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,120
Yeah.

68
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,120
So, yeah.

69
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,520
So and I love the Friday the 13th video game.

70
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,200
I know it gets a lot of crap for being a terrible video game, but I don't hate it.

71
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,960
I think the music was good, too.

72
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,160
It was creepy, very creepy.

73
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,040
And those those first person sequences in the house.

74
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,280
I'm sorry, that was that was some scary shit.

75
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,280
All right.

76
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,720
So those of you that are watching us live can see we're on the four shot tonight, which

77
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,160
means we have a guest joining us.

78
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,080
And say hello, everyone joining us all familiar face here at Orange Laundry.

79
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,080
Say hello to Shane.

80
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,080
Hello.

81
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,960
Hey, Shane, how are you doing?

82
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,240
I've been better.

83
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,760
I was going to say, you don't look so great.

84
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,080
Do you do you care to share with listeners what's going on?

85
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:16,560
No, because I've already talked about it before and posted on social media that I got COVID.

86
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,240
So, like, legit, you tested positive for COVID.

87
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,440
Yeah, it was this this is probably why I got it.

88
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,720
I took a test so I would have to not go to school the next day because we only have one

89
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,880
car and my husband needed it for something else.

90
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:41,280
Like, well, if I take a test, then I won't have to have I can't go to school.

91
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,640
And I was already like I had like a sore throat and a cough.

92
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,960
I was like, it's a good enough reason to let me get tested and then you can just take

93
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,960
the car.

94
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,240
Well, I got tested and oops, it was positive.

95
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,840
So it was that.

96
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,120
There's a name for the show if I ever heard one.

97
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,120
Oops, it was positive.

98
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,880
Well, obviously, I'm I'm giggling about it now, but it's not, you know, it luckily we

99
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,200
can make a little light of it because your symptoms, although they've been lingering,

100
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,240
haven't been serious enough to send you to the hospital or anything like that.

101
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,240
Right.

102
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:21,000
So the sore throat and cough, the sore throat was the worst thing for me.

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:30,240
Thankfully, I'm on day nine or ten now and my sore throat went away yesterday.

104
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,480
So that's good.

105
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:43,160
A cough, fatigue, general just breathing issues and crazy amounts of headache.

106
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,800
I don't normally get headaches, so it's very frustrating.

107
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,720
Now what is interesting about this scenario, too, is that, you know, I wasn't here on Orange

108
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,120
on Radio a couple of weeks ago because I took a trip out to Idaho.

109
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,540
I'm not sure how explicitly I said this, but I went to go visit Shane.

110
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,760
Like Shane is, you know, one of my longest friends.

111
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,760
And we thought, you know, you and your husband take this situation very seriously.

112
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,380
Me and Alan take this very seriously.

113
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,720
So we don't really get to see other people a lot.

114
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,180
So we kind of figured that the risk was low.

115
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:19,020
So something that you guys may not know, two hours before OLR last week is when Shane sent

116
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,900
me a text that was like, boy, do I have some news for you type of thing.

117
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,660
So I had to get a test Monday and mine was negative.

118
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,380
So there's that.

119
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:38,020
So it seems likely that you probably got COVID like a day or two after I left.

120
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,020
The way the timing works out, right?

121
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:47,860
Yeah, I think maybe one day, um, and it's, it's, I guess, I guess the term is funny.

122
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,780
It's funny too, because Dustin didn't get it.

123
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,300
He tested negative.

124
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,980
We have two roommates.

125
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,540
They tested negative.

126
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:01,340
It's just me, the person who screams all the time about wearing their mask and will not

127
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,860
take it off even in the car if I'm going to go get drive.

128
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,900
So I probably picked it up at school somehow.

129
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,740
Shane is joining us to talk about video games and not just COVID, but I have to say, just

130
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,460
to kind of back up your story a little bit, like when I got there on Thursday and like

131
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,940
got to your house, you and Dustin were wearing masks in the house and so was I.

132
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,020
And I was like, well, I don't want to be rude and take mine off.

133
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,100
They're going to keep theirs on.

134
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,980
And there was a point where I was like, are we just going to have our masks on in the

135
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,900
house all weekend?

136
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,620
And I think Shane was like, yep, but we did.

137
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,860
We ended up, obviously it just, it became too much and you know, but, uh, yeah.

138
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,540
So, um, well, obviously, you know, the, our chat is lighting up over at twitch.tv slash

139
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,220
VOG network.

140
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,820
Uh, there's a lot of people wishing you well, and I'm hoping that, uh, you feel a lot

141
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,900
better very soon.

142
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,940
Uh, and the good news is you have been slowly, like it just seems like this whole

143
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,900
process is just long is what's, what's annoying about it.

144
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,100
Yeah.

145
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,740
I mean, once I kicked the sore throat, everything else is manageable to me.

146
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,980
I don't mind getting fatigued.

147
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,580
I don't, headaches are stupid and I'm glad I normally don't get them because they are

148
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,100
so annoying.

149
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:17,980
Um, the cough is like, whatever, but man, it does suck.

150
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,180
And it does take a while.

151
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,620
And supposedly starting tomorrow, I'm okay to do stuff again.

152
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:25,620
Excuse me.

153
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,540
I'm okay to do stuff again, but like, no, you're not like, I'm sorry.

154
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,900
Hey, hey, Shane, do you feel like you have an adult Maine Coon sitting

155
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,180
on your chest the whole time?

156
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,620
A what?

157
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,020
A Maine Coon, giant cat, big cat.

158
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,540
Oh, I hope not.

159
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,940
No, I don't feel like that.

160
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,900
It doesn't feel like that.

161
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:48,980
See, when I had pneumonia quote fingers, I felt like that all the time, but I had

162
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,860
the sore throat and I had the headache the whole time and I couldn't move.

163
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,900
I felt like doing nothing but sitting in the chair.

164
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,420
Thank goodness Animal Crossing had just come out, but still, yeah, I hope you feel

165
00:08:59,420 --> 00:08:59,660
better.

166
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:00,660
Yeah.

167
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,460
Oh, thank you.

168
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,340
Yeah.

169
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:07,380
The doctor told me that he's like, you're probably not going to feel better really

170
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,180
for two weeks at least so, or like all the way better.

171
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,660
So I'm just gonna find a, I'm still not going to school.

172
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:19,340
I can't, I told them, yeah, I don't have a sore throat anymore, but the cough is

173
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,820
probably not a good thing to go back to class with.

174
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,900
So they listened and yeah, I'm still just going to take it easy.

175
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,740
I don't really have anywhere I need to be.

176
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,940
So let's just listen to your body first.

177
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,580
Uh, it took me six months, not six months, six weeks to fully get over all my

178
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,140
symptoms.

179
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,020
So listen to yourself first.

180
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,820
The doctors may tell you one, you know, blanket answer, but your body's going to

181
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,500
be the best judge.

182
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,260
Yeah.

183
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,100
Um, no one special 77 in our chat says the fact that Shane has yet to say

184
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,020
whatever during the call is a sure sign that he truly is sick.

185
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,780
Get well, dude.

186
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,820
Well, we haven't really talked about games yet, but I didn't bring you here

187
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,980
just to grill you about COVID, but I think it is one of those things people

188
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,060
are genuinely curious about, you know, cause it's, it's, it's everywhere.

189
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:05,540
Obviously.

190
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,540
Um, I mean, I'm laying in bed in the bedroom right now.

191
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,900
It's not like a normal studio experience.

192
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,740
I had to explain to the viewers why you look like shit.

193
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,700
Like, let's just, let's just say it.

194
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,380
What it is.

195
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,420
I'm not, my hair looks okay.

196
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,940
Your hair does not look like shit.

197
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,180
Like he's in bed with not bed hair.

198
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,500
I can tell Shane's like sick, like, but his, yes, your hair looks amazing.

199
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,100
I'll give you that.

200
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,180
All right.

201
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:31,940
Always does.

202
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,420
Thank you.

203
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,380
Okay.

204
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,020
Let's talk about games.

205
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:39,220
So obviously this whole COVID situation is shitty as it is means you get to stay

206
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,580
home and play a lot of video games.

207
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:40,900
Right.

208
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:46,460
So you've been playing a lot of the Pokemon DLC, right?

209
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,660
The Pokemon content, right?

210
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:48,780
Yes.

211
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,300
Oh my God.

212
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:55,180
I played it till like 6 AM the other night morning, something like that.

213
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,460
And I would tell us about it.

214
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,740
Cause I got to say, I don't, I mean, I know there is sword and shield DLC, but

215
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,340
I haven't played the first one yet.

216
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,460
So is this second one just like the first one, but with different

217
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,660
Pokemon or how's it different?

218
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,180
No, I feel like it's a step up.

219
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,460
Whereas the first DLC also kind of felt like a step up from the game.

220
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,420
Cause it was nothing but the wild area, but done a lot better.

221
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,660
This one is even better than that.

222
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:26,340
In terms of wild area, you know, there's some new legendaries, some new Galar

223
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,660
forms, but the part that matters is the Dynamax adventure.

224
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,780
The Dynamax adventures are what the max raid should have been.

225
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,740
And I cannot quit playing them.

226
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,700
There's so much fun.

227
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,620
What, tell us a little bit about what those entails.

228
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,020
So they're, they're, they're not quite like the raids, but there's some

229
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,820
similarity, right?

230
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:46,860
Correct.

231
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,180
They're like, they're a different style, right?

232
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,700
Because you still have four Pokemon against one, but in this one, you

233
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,180
don't bring your own Pokemon.

234
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:59,980
You are given a choice between like preset Pokemon, which is great because

235
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,660
then you don't see a lot of the same ones over and over again.

236
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,580
It's not like four legendaries against one thing that you're just

237
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,740
going to overpower really.

238
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,500
And nobody brings a fucking Magikarp that does nothing.

239
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,500
No, no, nobody brings a Magikarp.

240
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,460
I don't know.

241
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,900
Maybe you could get one on the way.

242
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,140
I don't know.

243
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,940
But anyway, you start out with four and you have to go through these tunnels.

244
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:26,980
And each at the end of each intersection is a Pokemon you fight just

245
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,300
like a normal max raid battle.

246
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,300
It has no shields.

247
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,740
So it's just one life bar.

248
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,540
And after you beat it, you and the other three people you're with get the

249
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:40,380
option to take that Pokemon with you for the rest of the journey.

250
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,140
And so you do that three times.

251
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,900
And at the end, you fight a legendary.

252
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:51,100
If you catch everything on the results screen, you get to take one of those

253
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:56,100
four Pokemon you caught to take back with what's great about that for people

254
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,780
like me is this is a fun way to shiny hunt while you're playing, none of the

255
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,940
Pokemon show up shiny, but at the end, the results screen where you pick the

256
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:10,860
Pokemon, if they're shiny and they have a one in 100% or one in 100 chance to be

257
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,260
shiny, it'll just show up on screen as a shiny, and then you take it and you

258
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,820
got yourself a brand new shiny.

259
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:22,420
Um, in fact, right before the show, a little, maybe a couple of hours, I ended

260
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:28,060
up getting a shiny, uh, legendary and I was super excited and it just made my

261
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,180
night.

262
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,660
Which legendary did you get?

263
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,100
Reshiram from black and white.

264
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:32,700
Oh, okay.

265
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,460
Congrats.

266
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:34,980
Thank you.

267
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:40,300
So is this kind of, um, one of the big, excuse me, is this one of the big, like

268
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:45,060
perks of this particular DLC is that you kind of get to do shiny legendary hunting,

269
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,820
which I don't think is something that's very easy to do in the games otherwise.

270
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,100
Right.

271
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,100
Maybe Pokemon go, but that's a non-issue.

272
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:58,660
Well, yes, I think the big draw for this content was supposed to just be

273
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:04,300
legendaries in general, but once the shiny odds for everything, plus the

274
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:11,740
legendaries that you, um, encounter in this new style of play, um, got figured

275
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,540
out, I think a lot more people were more excited.

276
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:20,060
Um, so yeah, the draw is legendaries, but for me it's yeah, shiny legendaries

277
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,540
or just random shinies.

278
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:26,780
Like, uh, maybe it was like my third or fourth time going through one of the

279
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:31,180
dungeons or whatever caverns I got a regular Pokemon.

280
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,580
I was like, whoa, I don't have this one yet.

281
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,140
That's awesome.

282
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,060
So it's neat.

283
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:40,460
I feel like my time is not wasted where max, max raids, I constantly

284
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,980
felt like my time was wasted.

285
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,420
Do you, do you think that they're going to end up doing a third DLC?

286
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,420
I know that that's been rumored for quite some time and, and could

287
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:54,380
potentially fill in the final remaining gaps and, and maybe make the national

288
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,100
Dexter's stop bitching, although I don't think they ever will.

289
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,620
But what do you, what do you think the status is on a potential third

290
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,260
DLC, just being a fan and follower of the series, as long as you have been.

291
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:10,420
Well, since my favorite Pokemon is not in yet, still, I want a third DLC.

292
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:16,020
If they didn't do a third DLC, I could see that still being okay.

293
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,380
And then next year we just get another new proper game.

294
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:25,540
Um, but if they were to do third DLC and not do a new proper game next year,

295
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:29,780
it's gotta be more expensive than what we've been given for, I feel like.

296
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,020
Do you think it's going to be a proper, um, game next year?

297
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,020
Or do you think it's going to end up being like a remake of either gen four

298
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,020
or like a let's go gen two type of thing?

299
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:39,420
What do you think?

300
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,500
I never want to let's go game after again.

301
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,860
So not no to that.

302
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,500
Well, I didn't say what you wanted.

303
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,780
I said what you think will happen.

304
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,820
Those are the same thing.

305
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:54,140
So no, I don't want nor think the let's go game should happen.

306
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,420
Um, I don't want a gen four remake either.

307
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,460
I'd rather have something new personally.

308
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,580
I'd rather have a third DLC over a gen four remake.

309
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,260
Okay.

310
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,540
Um, over at chat, uh, sg100 matt says, are the national deck

311
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,820
sirs still complaining?

312
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,860
Is water wet?

313
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,420
Like look at the responses to any Pokemon tweet.

314
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,260
Sorry, buddy.

315
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:18,740
Uh, at depth and chat says, uh, I don't think we'll get a third DLC, but I do

316
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,060
think we're getting Sinnoh remakes next.

317
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,380
So kind of on that train of the gen four remakes potentially next.

318
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,180
Yeah.

319
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:31,380
If gen four does come next, at least that means we're one step closer to a gen

320
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,980
five remade and that's all I realize.

321
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,940
Um, so anything else you want to say about Pokemon?

322
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,700
No, no.

323
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,060
Okay.

324
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,580
Let's talk about another game that, um, you've been playing a little bit and I've

325
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,780
been playing a little bit, so I'm getting into my gaming week just a little bit, but

326
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,380
with good reason cause Shane's still here.

327
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,020
Um, so, and, and this is also one of the things where I've been sitting here for

328
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:57,340
several months now saying, um, I'm probably not going to do this.

329
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,300
I'm, I really don't have any interest in doing this.

330
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,460
I'm not going to do this.

331
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:05,220
And, uh, I went and did it and that is, uh, playing world of warcraft.

332
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,020
And the reason why is because, uh, Shane, you've been playing it a little bit

333
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,140
because of the, uh, well, actually what, what made you want to play that again?

334
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:20,420
Actually, two things, uh, just curiosity to kind of see how the game has been.

335
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:27,300
Cause even if, even if I don't love it or even like it as much as I used to, it's

336
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:33,100
kind of like revisiting something, uh, like your hometown or something, you know,

337
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,860
I spent a lot of time in that stupid game and it's just kind of neat to

338
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,660
check out every once in a while.

339
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,220
So that's one reason.

340
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:46,740
And the second reason was they, um, decided to do a whole bunch of additional

341
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,980
customization for the game, for the races.

342
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,940
And I thought one of the problems that game has is every character

343
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,620
looks very much the same.

344
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,540
There's not a lot of diversity in what you can make.

345
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:03,300
And they were really trying to step up the diversity.

346
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,140
So I thought I would go check it.

347
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,620
Yeah, I'll say that the character customization.

348
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,460
I'm going to get, that's a big win.

349
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,220
Like it's, and it's not, obviously the diversity stuff is a huge win,

350
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,940
but like, it's even more than that.

351
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,700
Like, it's just like the way you can customize like Torrens.

352
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,260
I noticed, I was like, dang, you can make a Torren look really good.

353
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,500
And it's, I was very impressed with that whole thing.

354
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,180
I will say that.

355
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,860
Um, but yeah, you know, I was, I was dragging my feet in the sand.

356
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,620
I'm like, I'm not going to do this.

357
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,300
I'm not going to do this.

358
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,340
And we have this long running joke on Orange Launch Radio that Shane has these

359
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,420
mysterious powers of persuasion where he can usually convince people to play

360
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,900
whatever game he wants them to play or do whatever.

361
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,700
But I was, I was standing firm on this one.

362
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,020
I'm like, no, I'm not dropping that kind of money on wow.

363
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,540
I'm not a huge Blizzard person these days.

364
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,380
Anyway, I'm going to sit this one out.

365
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,500
And then it's, you know, Rob, I got COVID and I'm bored.

366
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:56,740
Okay.

367
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:57,820
No, no.

368
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,100
Well, there's a, there's other stuff we're not going to bring up on the show.

369
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,100
You had a very bad week.

370
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:02,420
Yeah.

371
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,260
Yeah.

372
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,260
I had a very bad week.

373
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:11,380
Um, but also in my defense, I did not really ask you to play so

374
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,380
much as you offered to play.

375
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:20,260
I finally caved because you had a lot of stuff going on and I recognize that.

376
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,180
And I'm like, okay, if I could do this thing to make Shane happy, I'll do it.

377
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,740
And I was like, you know what, if nothing else, I'll have an educated

378
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,940
opinion when I talk about it.

379
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,660
And, um, my educated opinion is like, it's again, the character

380
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,820
customization is cool.

381
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:38,500
Um, the level squish is interesting, but I'm, I'm kinda, I don't know.

382
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,740
Like I, anything is always more fun with friends.

383
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,380
I like playing with you.

384
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,140
And I like playing with the small friend group we have that still plays.

385
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:46,420
Wow.

386
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,580
Wow is interesting when that's happening.

387
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,180
But like I was starting to do kind of like a little priest on my own and I

388
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,300
was running it back through the Missa Pandaria areas and stuff and kind of

389
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,420
like getting reunited with stuff.

390
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:00,700
And I have to admit there kind of came a point where I was like, Hmm, this

391
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,940
isn't really fun alone.

392
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,260
And it's not something I really like.

393
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,260
I was just like, I'm going to go back to Final Fantasy 14 and

394
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,460
get my goals done in that game.

395
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:13,340
So like, I dunno, I hope the expansion turns out well for that community.

396
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,580
Cause there's a great, you know, community there, but I can't say there

397
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:21,260
was like, as much as they talk about this, this, um, uh, Shadowlands pre-patch

398
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,340
was huge changes and huge things going on with the levels, which is the

399
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,660
biggest changes to the game since Cataclysm, like as much as I hear all

400
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,900
that, and I can see that from the technical levels and everything, I

401
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,540
just couldn't help but feel, eh, this game is the same old shit.

402
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,020
Like this really hasn't changed that much in 15 years.

403
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:44,540
Well, in the, since, since Blizzard started going down the, since Mike

404
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,380
Morhaime left, it hasn't changed much.

405
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:51,620
So I think both and 14 are fine games in their own rights.

406
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,620
What's been good about Lout is that it's a game I can kind of

407
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,300
turn my brain off playing.

408
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:04,860
Whereas 14, even if we do the same two dungeons on an expert roulette over and

409
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,700
over, and there's not much variance, I still somewhat feel like I have to think

410
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:17,900
more and wow, like I got a character from, uh, zero to 40 in like two days.

411
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,620
Cause I could just sit there and mindlessly play.

412
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:27,660
So maybe it's cause it's all old content still, but I don't know.

413
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,220
It's good for mana and stuff.

414
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,740
It is really fascinating how Blizzard has just basically said, okay, so old

415
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,700
world of Warcraft is going to go squish like, and you're going to get through it

416
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,180
in the blink of an eye, and then we're just going to move right on to the latest

417
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:42,700
expansion.

418
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:47,780
So they really are hedging like the future of WoW basically, or maybe not on

419
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,460
this new, I think WoW will still be, if EverQuest has like 20 expansions, WoW

420
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,500
is still going to be around a long time, but, uh, they're hedging a lot of the

421
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,420
future of WoW on this new expansion.

422
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,020
So, yeah, and that they ended up delaying.

423
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,620
So it'd be interesting.

424
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,220
Okay.

425
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,100
So we talked Pokemon.

426
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,860
We talked, wow.

427
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,980
Any other video games I've got to talk with you about Shane?

428
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:06,540
Okay.

429
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,540
We'll talk about that.

430
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:12,100
Let's actually tie that into the other kickoff topic I had planned for tonight.

431
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,140
Um, so Loki, if you don't mind me throwing the ball to you, uh, there was a huge

432
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,180
historic event on Twitter.

433
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,260
Everybody knows what this is going to be, uh, that involved that game

434
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,380
among us this week, right?

435
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,340
Uh, Loki, just so you know, you're muted and I can't hear you.

436
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:24,740
Sorry.

437
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,700
I thought I had unmuted.

438
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,980
It's 2020.

439
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,820
We're all used to asking when people unmute happens.

440
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,300
Yes.

441
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:39,260
So, um, uh, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, um, streamed on Twitch, which,

442
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,780
uh, she had teased about doing.

443
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:46,500
Uh, she is one of the representatives in the, I wouldn't say the house.

444
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:53,740
And so, um, it's just kind of a really unique thing because normally, you know,

445
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,460
you don't see a lot of these representatives and stuff, uh, connecting

446
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:02,780
with their constituents in kind of a more modern way, for example.

447
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:09,540
So, um, of course it was met with, you know, uh, a lot of viewers because

448
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,820
everyone was really interested in this and it was overall pretty wholesome

449
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,420
about it, but it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was,

450
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:21,260
it drew in over, uh, four thousand, four hundred and thirty thousand viewers.

451
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,300
I want to say that number's probably a little low because I think that's

452
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,820
just her stream was the peak on that.

453
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,340
But considering that all the other people that were playing along with

454
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:34,060
her, um, lots of other streamers, there's probably folks watching

455
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,060
through them as well.

456
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,060
So I would, I think that number's probably a bit lower.

457
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,780
And it was also, um, that was the concurrent viewers.

458
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,540
If you go and you, so now, and Twitch didn't always do this, but now with

459
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:48,420
the VODs or the video on demand, it actually shows a view count.

460
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:52,460
So like most of the VODs on VOG Network were one, two, three, four, five

461
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,940
views, you know, very few people going in the archive and looking at old shows.

462
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,620
Um, but now what happens, it doesn't do that anymore.

463
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,380
Well, it does for the highlights of the show, but like if you go back

464
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,740
and you watch the live uncropped version, basically with all the, you

465
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,140
know, standby, we'll be live soon and all that stuff, it actually shows

466
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:12,820
the number of views that this episode got while we were live all together.

467
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:16,020
So a lot of them have, you know, 120, 130, however many people

468
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,260
dropped in and out during the show.

469
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:23,020
My point is AOC's stream had, had 5 million less last I checked.

470
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,380
Now, obviously this made, yeah, this, this made news.

471
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,140
Maybe there were people going in and out several times during the thing.

472
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,020
A lot of people checking it out after the fact, I'm sure as it was linked

473
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:35,780
on all these news blogs and things like that, but that's, that's huge.

474
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,980
That's a lot of people.

475
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,300
It was, and it was really, it was really like a wholesome, the whole

476
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,420
thing was like a very wholesome stream.

477
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,100
Um, it was fun to see a lot of different content creators get

478
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,020
together to kind of pull this off because originally the whole thing

479
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,860
started off with, um, she was posting on Twitter, Hey, who'd be interested

480
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:58,580
in an Among Us stream and everyone's like, yeah, me, me, me, instant exposure.

481
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:58,900
Yeah.

482
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,500
So you had, you know, like lots of online personalities.

483
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:05,260
Uh, first off another representative Ilhan Omar was in there as well.

484
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:05,980
So that was great.

485
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,140
Um, yeah, she was vicious.

486
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:16,660
So many people, uh, yeah, you had a Hassan piker, a pokey main, uh, Dr.

487
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:22,740
Lupo disguised toast, uh, moist, critical myth, um, jacksepticeye.

488
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,860
I know Gus buckets or Gus Johnson was in there as well.

489
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,940
Um, uh, what was it?

490
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,740
Corpse husband who that guy had a voice voice.

491
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:37,740
Um, so yeah, it was just, it was a great, great event overall.

492
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:43,980
Um, lots of just kind of promoting folks to go to the polls, vote, um, get

493
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:48,340
registered to vote if you're not registered, um, I mean, it was just great.

494
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:52,220
And it was just like, it was a nice change of pace with all the chaos going

495
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:56,140
on, just to like, be able to connect with someone, you know, a politician in a way

496
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:01,340
that's not like just wanting to drive you nuts, it was like someone relatable at

497
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,300
least, and I think that's kind of what she was going for with that.

498
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,980
So overall really great.

499
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,020
For sure.

500
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:12,540
And over in our chat, SSJ 100, Matt, let me give you a, for, uh, for, uh, for

501
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:16,540
instance, game number one of the world series that happened that same night had

502
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,420
about 15 K concurrent worldwide.

503
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:23,380
And that's compared to the 400 plus K, uh, plus, plus when you count the

504
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:27,780
other streamers, the AOC had now, look, I'm not bringing this story up on OLR.

505
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,060
We're not bringing this story up on OLR necessarily for the political side of it.

506
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:35,260
Like it's no secret that, you know, the host of the show tend to lean a little

507
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:35,700
left.

508
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,060
Okay.

509
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,420
Like I know you've picked that up over the time.

510
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:43,220
Um, I don't necessarily a hundred percent agree with AOC all the time.

511
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,740
Like I don't necessarily agree with every of her ideas and things like that.

512
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,940
Um, but, uh, I agree with a lot of them.

513
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:54,780
And I was more taken by, as opposed to agree or disagree or any of that stuff,

514
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:59,340
putting all of that aside, I would like to think that if I was someone who leaned

515
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:03,860
right, I would still be somebody that would be pretty impressed with, and I

516
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:10,180
think that keyword is relatable, how she really made politics and politicians

517
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:15,580
feel relatable and it's, it's ironic that the whole game was called among us

518
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,580
because I'm sure there'd be some people that are gonna make the joke, LOL, she's

519
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:24,500
an imposter, but I kind of felt she was really among us, you know, and Ilhan Omar

520
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:24,940
as well.

521
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:29,980
And even, and if you want to talk about right-leaning versus left-leaning and all

522
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:34,460
that stuff, uh, during the thing she was talking about, shout out, because I know

523
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,180
other congressional representatives are listening.

524
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:39,620
She's like, I'm getting text messages from Justin Amash right now, da, da, da, da,

525
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,140
da, and she's like shouting him out and now he's talking about, and he's more

526
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,700
right-leaning, right-leaning, sorry, I can't talk tonight.

527
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,940
Um, but he's talking about setting up some type of Twitch feed.

528
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,420
Now this isn't the first time we've seen politics on Twitch, right?

529
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,540
We know Bernie had a channel.

530
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,820
We know Donald Trump had a channel, had a channel.

531
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,940
I think he might have it back.

532
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,340
I don't know.

533
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:08,460
But, but all that jokes aside, most of what you would see on both of those

534
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,540
channels, and that's a very left and a very right channel, most of what you would

535
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:16,780
see on both of those channels were just, eh, simulcasts of rallies, simulcasts of

536
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,940
other events that the news is covering, so on and so on.

537
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:24,180
What made AOC different and what I very much believe is newsworthy in the game

538
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,660
industry, no matter where you lean politically, what made that stream

539
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:33,740
interesting was that it was a political event bringing awareness to early voting

540
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:38,740
that was, that really went into what Twitch is all about.

541
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,780
It was a standing congressional representative, one that gets talked about

542
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:48,620
an awful lot, uh, getting in there, playing video games, having fun, and

543
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,540
again, that keyword relatable.

544
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:56,100
And you know, I've said this ever since I dated my ex 10 plus years ago, who you

545
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,020
all met at one point or another, and what, what was the message I took away from

546
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,260
that?

547
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,340
Any idiot can do politics.

548
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,700
If that guy can do it, you can do it.

549
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,940
And I think AOC, I think brought that same message in a much more positive way,

550
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:13,420
uh, that like, Hey, I like to play video games on Twitch too, and this is

551
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,660
something, you know, you could do if you wanted to get into politics.

552
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,860
I just, I thought that was just rad.

553
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:23,580
And like Loki said, I thought it was just like a wholesome, positive thing that

554
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,620
didn't get, I mean, sure the chat comments would range from, you know,

555
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,300
wholesome to dumpster fire.

556
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,780
But I just, who's, who has time to reach out in general?

557
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:37,380
I mean, on a stream who has time to reach out, it's scrolling by so fast.

558
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,260
I'm more into the actual, like, I'm more into the way she's acting when she's like

559
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:46,060
an imposter and she's like, I don't know if I can, I don't, you know, she's like

560
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,500
super skittish about it and she kills somebody.

561
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,660
She's like, I'm sorry, you know, and like all those things, it's just watching her

562
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,500
go through that was, was really something.

563
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:58,340
Uh, Jamie, I, I, I, did you catch this by chance or any of the highlight

564
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,460
reels after the fact or anything?

565
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,620
I couldn't because I was working on Project Nunway.

566
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,860
Oh, right, right.

567
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:09,860
So, um, I sadly had other priorities that needed to be taken care of.

568
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:17,980
Like, you know, uh, fighting a Google Meet stream with many, many viewers on it.

569
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,180
Fair enough.

570
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,260
Been doing my lines, so sorry.

571
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:21,980
That's okay.

572
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,380
I read, I read a lot of the tweets about it though.

573
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,940
And I was, she was just really, really cool.

574
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,020
Just in her tweets about it.

575
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,060
I thought it was really cool.

576
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:29,700
Yeah.

577
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,300
Um, going to our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.

578
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,900
Um, as she says, AOC grew up in my hometown and I'm friends with folks

579
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,260
who knew her back in high school.

580
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,180
She was always a hardcore gamer.

581
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,460
She was playing Smash Brothers Melee in the gaming club in high school.

582
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,180
That's pretty cool.

583
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:49,820
Um, you know, and I, and one of the big takeaways I took and, you know,

584
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:56,420
I, the reality is, you know, you've got the president doing these big

585
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:01,020
rallies and people aren't really wearing masks, people aren't really

586
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,500
social distancing, we can all see that.

587
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,900
It's not exactly taking the COVID guidelines seriously

588
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,300
and all that's going on.

589
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,940
And those big events, I mean, they are big and they draw several

590
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,460
thousand people, we know that.

591
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,460
But AOC, interestingly enough, found a way to do a big political

592
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:24,420
event in a very COVID safe pandemic, safe way, that reached out to a

593
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:28,260
generation that oftentimes doesn't get targeted with these types of

594
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,460
things and needs to have sometimes that fire lit under their butt to

595
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,620
go vote a little bit, right?

596
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:37,740
The younger generation and drew in 400,000 plus people while doing it.

597
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:42,460
So if you think about it, she just put on the biggest political rally

598
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,740
of 2020 on Twitch.

599
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:49,500
In a way, I realize I'm, I'm logically connecting some big dots there,

600
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,460
but I, I can't help, but find it fascinating.

601
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,300
And like Loki said, I was also kind of glued to the TV.

602
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:00,340
It was, it was just a good stream because she's also not one of those

603
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,300
streamers that completely gets sidelined with, you know, all the

604
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,620
other stuff going on on Twitch.

605
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,140
She was just in there playing the game, having a good time.

606
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:12,980
Shane, I've been making you wait, but you love Among Us and I'm sorry,

607
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:18,580
but what did you, what did you think of the stream?

608
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,260
Oh, I thought it was great.

609
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,940
Like, I don't really know what else to say beyond that.

610
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:32,980
I thought it was really informative and entertaining and like for what

611
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:37,460
you could kind of consider a political stream, I didn't feel it was preachy.

612
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:44,420
And I obviously lean towards her too politically, but like everything

613
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:50,940
was presented in a way that is not your typical old person politician.

614
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:57,380
And so it felt like it felt a lot easier to digest and like, okay, yeah,

615
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,620
this is just, this is great.

616
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,340
I loved it.

617
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,940
I watched pretty much all of it.

618
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,500
It wasn't preachy.

619
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,100
You're right.

620
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:08,020
But definitely there were little things that were being dropped.

621
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:11,940
Like when she talked to the guy from the UK about healthcare.

622
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,260
And then I think Pokimane was from Canada as well.

623
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,780
So she was kind of talking to them about their experiences with healthcare.

624
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,180
And she was asking all those questions.

625
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,780
She's like, so you can just walk into the doctor.

626
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,220
Wow.

627
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,260
You know, that whole thing.

628
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,460
And she kind of gave her perspective on that.

629
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,260
So, but you're right.

630
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:29,740
It came off in a way that didn't sound at least to me, but maybe, and to be

631
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:33,260
fair, maybe it's because yes, I agree with her more than I disagree with her.

632
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,500
But it didn't come off as preachy to me.

633
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:39,300
I thought it was just an interesting, she's just asking questions from people

634
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,260
around the world, literally trying to get to know her people she's playing with

635
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,460
and, you know, get to know the game.

636
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:46,460
Yeah.

637
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,940
So, um, uh, no one special is asking in chat.

638
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:50,620
Okay.

639
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,140
Question.

640
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,980
Normally, if a viewer makes a comment that a streamer doesn't like, they can

641
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:57,860
purge the comment or timeout ban the viewer, which is all fine and dandy.

642
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:01,740
Now, since AOC is a politician and Twitch is now serving as an avenue to reach out

643
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:05,620
to politicians about whatever issue, does purging comments, timeouts, bans, et

644
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,420
cetera, get a little iffy legally?

645
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,020
Um, yes it does actually.

646
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,420
It does get a little iffy legally.

647
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:15,420
Um, I believe the stream was moderated, but they didn't accept, like if somebody

648
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:20,660
came in there and wrote a pro Trump thing, I don't think they like legally or would

649
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,860
really have the time to remove it.

650
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:27,340
I think they just let it sit because, um, and this was a big problem.

651
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,180
You remember that story?

652
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:32,860
It was about a month ago about the military streaming on Twitch and they

653
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,460
started to ban people who had come in there and asked these questions about,

654
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:40,020
you know, certain, you know, military thing and all these things asking the

655
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:44,140
hard questions and the military started like banning people and people like suit

656
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,100
them over that.

657
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:50,540
So the military has a very like rigid policy on what they do and they don't

658
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:54,020
allow, but essentially as long as you're not threatening or, you know, do this,

659
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:57,780
you can go in there and ask about war crimes and stuff and they really can't ban

660
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,700
you. And so I, I think, and I don't really have all the details on how this

661
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,460
works, but I think the way AOC kind of approached her stream was similar.

662
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:10,380
Like if somebody had said something threatening or extremely gross, I'm sure

663
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:16,820
it got taken care of, but all the MAGA 2020 spam and all that stuff, it didn't,

664
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,620
they just, you know, what are you going to do?

665
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,860
You, you couldn't ban that stuff fast enough, right?

666
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:25,940
Well, speak, speaking of spam as you would, please.

667
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:34,180
Because of the popularity of this AOC driven event and among us, apparently a,

668
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:43,100
um, a guy by the name of Eris Loris, he went in and hacked among us to spam a

669
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:50,940
bunch of, uh, messages and cause like this, uh, black screen kind of, um, thing

670
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,820
where the map basically disappears because of it using some bots that he

671
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:59,140
created. So, you know, stuff, you know, saying like the whole hack your device

672
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:02,860
or blow up your phone, if you don't subscribe to his channel and then also

673
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:09,500
Trump 2020 at the end, apparently he, uh, he did cop to that.

674
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:15,140
He did it and basically said that, you know, he doesn't care that it's a small

675
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:19,780
company, you know, run by three people that they should have, you know, patch

676
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,580
their game up better or something like that.

677
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:26,980
And he did it for the, the lols and trolling people because that's what he

678
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:33,980
does. And apparently, of course, you know, when asked about whether, you know, he

679
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,380
was, you know, he of course added the bit in there because he is a Trump

680
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:41,540
supporter, but just kind of shows you the con, you know, the contrast between

681
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:45,540
how, you know, one side will try to get the word out.

682
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:49,900
And then the other side is just like, Oh, let's, you know, let's spam some, you

683
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,500
know, anger and hatred stuff because I don't like, I don't like something that

684
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,220
you guys did.

685
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,980
Yeah, that whole stunt kind of backfires for your team when you do that, I think.

686
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,100
So, um, not, not great.

687
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:03,660
And, you know, God, imagine you are the creators of Among Us.

688
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:08,700
Like, seriously, they created this game two years ago and, you know, it, I'm

689
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,980
sure it did well enough cause they were planning a sequel, but not nearly the

690
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,020
fanfare we're talking about now.

691
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:17,740
Two years after these three people put out this game, you have a congressional

692
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:21,420
representative playing it on a Twitch stream to the third largest stream of all

693
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:21,740
time.

694
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:28,420
That's crazy in a good way, you know, like just, just how far that game has come.

695
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,060
It's, it's, it's something else.

696
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:30,860
It's something else.

697
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,100
Yeah.

698
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,100
I basically said, he's all, I was curious to see what would happen.

699
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,540
And personally, I found it funny.

700
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,620
The anger and hatred is part of what makes it funny.

701
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:44,420
If you care about a game and are willing to go and spam dislikes, some, um, random

702
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,380
dueling internet, because you can't play it for three minutes, it's stupid.

703
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:53,540
So anyway, um, it's, it's sad that that is happening when Among Us probably doesn't

704
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:57,900
have the staff to be able to handle that fast enough, but I'm, I'm sure they will

705
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:03,700
get some help, but it's gonna be, it's gonna be bumpy as people choose to, uh, do

706
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,420
these types of stunts to pick on them or whatever it is they're doing.

707
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,260
It's, it's silly.

708
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:12,220
Um, Shane, I, I know you've been playing just a crap ton of Among Us and you were

709
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,060
really into this game.

710
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,940
What is it about this game that you enjoy and, and tell us about kind of like what

711
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,180
you've been doing because you've been playing on streams and stuff too, right?

712
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,980
Yeah, I've been playing with some friends.

713
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:27,740
Um, so I think my first way to describe it, which is like the best way I can, or

714
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:32,780
like, uh, yeah, the best way I can describe it is it's as close to playing real life

715
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,620
Danganronpa as I'm ever probably going to get.

716
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,500
Um, that's pretty cool.

717
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,260
I actually, that's a very apt description.

718
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,180
Yeah.

719
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,060
I, without pink blood.

720
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:52,100
Yeah, no pink blood, but like you all gather around like a little table at, you

721
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,780
know, after every, after somebody dies and you'd talk about it.

722
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,580
But, um, I don't know.

723
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:04,460
I like, I like being sneaky and murdering people while also convincing them I didn't

724
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:08,500
do it and making other people argue.

725
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:13,340
Like it's my game that it's just like what I want to do in real life.

726
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:16,340
Basically, so I don't know.

727
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:16,940
It's great.

728
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,340
Like last night I had a few rounds.

729
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:24,300
I had, I got to be imposter back to back and, Oh, I killed so many people

730
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,660
and nobody ever suspected me.

731
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:31,940
And I just, I kind of shut my mouth, let every, all the, the louder people talk.

732
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,420
They kicked each other out the airlock and then I just went

733
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,700
and I killed more people.

734
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,580
It was great.

735
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,580
It's just fun.

736
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,100
And the best part is for me is I'm playing right now with a group of people

737
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,580
that don't get mad about the game.

738
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:50,940
Like we may get loud during the, like during the discussion times, but after

739
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:55,860
like we either win or lose, like we're all just laughing and like congratulating

740
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,620
each other and, and just, it's fun.

741
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,700
Like you cannot play with randoms.

742
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,100
Do not play with randoms.

743
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,260
If you're playing the game, it will take all the fun out of it.

744
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,300
Play with people, you know.

745
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:07,820
All right.

746
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,780
So, uh, let me get some comments from chat.

747
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:14,340
So, um, as Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, Shane is deep down a chaos monster.

748
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,020
True.

749
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,300
Oh, deep down.

750
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,260
No, that's pretty outward.

751
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:25,740
Uh, act Defton chat says, act Defton chat says to this day, I haven't played

752
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:30,300
among us, not even once, but I've seen a lot of videos and streams of people

753
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:34,580
playing it same, I'm almost afraid to play it at this point because I'm not

754
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,540
going to know what I'm doing.

755
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,420
And so many people have played this game.

756
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,300
Like they're going to be like, where'd you find the body?

757
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,620
I don't know.

758
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:44,380
Like I was, so I'm still technically new at it.

759
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:48,980
I forget the names of locations all the time, but you know, like, Oh, I'm

760
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:52,140
in the upper left side of the map and like, yeah, I don't think, I don't

761
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,860
think it matters about our engine.

762
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,780
I'm like, sure.

763
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,300
Yeah, that's exactly where I'm at.

764
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,260
And I'm usually telling the truth about that.

765
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:58,980
Cause I just don't.

766
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,420
So I, and this is another game where Shane has been trying to use his power

767
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:08,900
of persuasion on me and honestly, I'm not exactly resisting, like I'm

768
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,300
not opposed to playing among us.

769
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,700
I just, it has to be kind of like the right time in the right environment.

770
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,900
But so Shane, some things he keeps asking me when we're going to play.

771
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,420
Cause he wants to play with us.

772
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,980
Cause he keeps asking me to play with him, but.

773
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,900
Um, there's not a lot of people that want to play.

774
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:25,860
All right.

775
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,820
My niece plays it.

776
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,580
She's yeah, she's like a little kid.

777
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,300
They love it.

778
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,460
I'm like, wow.

779
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,300
So, so Shane pay attention.

780
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,100
Cause some things are starting to come together here.

781
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,540
Okay.

782
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,300
Listen to this.

783
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:39,780
Black and Pat and chat says, I haven't been able to get a group together to play

784
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,980
or been invited to play on anyone's stream.

785
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:42,700
Hmm.

786
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,220
Uh, let's see.

787
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:50,700
SSU 100 Matt says, so VOG game night among us when, um, pod culture says,

788
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,900
have yet to play it, let's get a VOG group together.

789
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,700
Hmm.

790
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,780
Hmm.

791
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,620
So maybe let's do it.

792
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,300
Let's do it.

793
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,740
As long as everybody's cool and not going to yell at each other for real and not

794
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,700
hold grudges, it's totally a fun game to play.

795
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:08,500
All right.

796
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,780
So we'll have a VOG among us night in the coming days.

797
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:16,900
So stay tuned, Black and Pat for your invite and a who a pod culture and so

798
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,860
forth, uh, stay tuned cause we'll want to dev definitely, uh, all those folks.

799
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:23,740
I just named, we want to get involved with that, uh, type of thing.

800
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,260
And, uh, you know, rule number one, just fucking be cool about it.

801
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:30,940
It's rule number one.

802
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:31,700
All right.

803
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,060
Yeah.

804
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:36,260
Sometimes the games go like the, one of the last games we played last night,

805
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,860
one person got seen venting.

806
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,620
So we knew exactly that person was going to get kicked off.

807
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:45,180
And then the other person was trying to vouch for them.

808
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:48,260
They're like, no, you can't, we literally saw the event.

809
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,660
So the game lasted like two minutes.

810
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,580
So what are you going to do?

811
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,660
And it happens, but the nice thing is you don't just play one round.

812
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,740
Do you play like 10 rounds in a night?

813
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:04,340
And so, you know, you'd, you'd, you'd be able to brush it off at some point.

814
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:05,420
Yep.

815
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,540
It's probably a great time.

816
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:12,340
Well, if you want to get in on the action with among us, um, let's, uh, we'll set

817
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:16,260
something up on our discord channels, uh, discord, so stay tuned, uh, over at

818
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:21,820
vognetwork.com that's vognetwork.com slash discord, uh, stay tuned and we'll try to

819
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:25,180
put something together for the coming weeks at some point here, I know with this

820
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,100
week being Halloween, there's probably a lot of stuff going on.

821
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:31,180
We'll try to get something Saturday.

822
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:31,580
Yeah.

823
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:34,740
But you know, people will be doing stuff throughout the week, uh, hopefully

824
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:38,620
virtually, but I do know there's a lot of outdoor type of art events and drive

825
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,180
through things and stuff going on.

826
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,860
So, you know, people are making the 2020 thing work, so, uh, we'll make it work.

827
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:44,500
Anyway.

828
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,300
Um, Shane, you've been holding that iPad above your head for so long now.

829
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,220
So thank you for doing that.

830
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,620
I know you're fatigued and have COVID.

831
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,220
I know you're sick.

832
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,380
Uh, please feel better.

833
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:58,260
And everybody in chat, as well as here in the, the, the chat here, uh, definitely

834
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,900
wish you feel better and do better and all that.

835
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,020
And the good news is you, you have been getting better as the days go on.

836
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:04,940
It's just slow, right?

837
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:05,940
Yeah.

838
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:06,420
Yeah.

839
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:06,660
Yeah.

840
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:11,620
I'm kind of feeling like I'm plateauing now, but it's not as bad as it was to

841
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:12,140
start.

842
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,780
And so I can't complain.

843
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:14,540
All right.

844
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:17,460
Um, anything else on any games or anything you want to share with us

845
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,780
tonight before we let you go?

846
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,500
As always, everybody needs to play the game of the year.

847
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,260
Hades.

848
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:24,780
It's the best.

849
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,260
I forgot to ask you about that.

850
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:27,860
I haven't started it yet.

851
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,140
Oh, it's so good.

852
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,540
It's just so good.

853
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,460
Quick, quick update on how Hades is going for you.

854
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,900
Somebody in chat asks, like, why hasn't Shane brought Hades up?

855
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,220
I forgot to get back to, we just had so much other stuff to talk about.

856
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,980
I would never not bring Hades up.

857
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:42,780
So it's okay.

858
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:43,620
Don't worry.

859
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:48,340
Um, I romance the character I wanted to.

860
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:49,660
That was awesome.

861
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:53,500
I've unlocked a few weapon aspects.

862
00:44:53,660 --> 00:45:00,540
I still have not got the prologue, but to be fair, the past week I've not really

863
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:06,900
been playing, um, because of the fatigue, like holding a controller for a long

864
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,980
period of time, just kind of wears on me.

865
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:13,300
Like even Pokemon I've not like, even though I'm playing it a lot, it's easy

866
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:17,060
because I can set a command, put down the controller for a minute, then pick it back

867
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:21,580
up or even just rest the controller on my desk and do it.

868
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:24,620
But, um, no, Hades has gone great.

869
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:28,740
I'm technically almost done in quote marks, but that game is so good.

870
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:29,900
I won't ever be done.

871
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:30,700
All right.

872
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:31,780
All right.

873
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:35,020
Well, we're going to let you go and move on with the rest of our gaming weeks,

874
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,100
but, um, have a good one.

875
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:36,620
Feel better.

876
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:39,660
Check in and chat in the next week or two and let us know how you're doing.

877
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:39,980
Okay.

878
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:41,300
Okay.

879
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:41,660
All right.

880
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:41,980
Bye.

881
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:42,900
Kick me out.

882
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:44,060
All right.

883
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,020
Can someone click and dry?

884
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:46,900
I can't do it because I'm on my phone.

885
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,500
Can someone just drag him out of the channel somewhere else?

886
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:48,820
All right.

887
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:49,780
Bye.

888
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:50,660
Uh, all right.

889
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,740
Uh, so we're going to, uh, shift gears into the rest of our gaming

890
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,220
weeks here and get into that.

891
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:57,460
So, uh, dark soccer, why don't you start us off?

892
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:58,540
How was your gaming week?

893
00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:59,580
What have you been playing this week?

894
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:04,100
I've only had time for animal crossing to be perfectly honest, just because of

895
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,820
project, uh, none way, which was a success.

896
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,420
We're still taking donations and the videos are going to be up at

897
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:12,020
capital city sisters.org.

898
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:16,980
So you can see me walk the runway looking really thrifty.

899
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:23,460
Um, but, uh, other than that, it's really just been time for animal crossing a

900
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,500
little bit, um, doing lots of video editing, lots of audio editing.

901
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:32,060
Um, and, uh, God was playing something else.

902
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:36,740
I am back to word scapes just to try to keep my brain active, but I do have

903
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:41,340
Hades and I am going to be playing it probably during the next week.

904
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:44,580
Cause I don't really have many projects right now.

905
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:47,380
Um, I'm taking November off of projects.

906
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:53,140
Um, and I'm actually plan well, other than, other than my, my blog at, uh,

907
00:46:53,180 --> 00:47:00,420
Gen X geeks with an X, um, but I'm, uh, I'm going to be, uh, getting my streaming

908
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:03,740
going starting in November and I still want to do that charity stream.

909
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:08,540
So when I'm gaming, I'll let people know right now, real life has intruded.

910
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:09,420
All right.

911
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,420
Sounds good for now.

912
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,860
I hope the event is, continues to be a big success.

913
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:16,020
Cause you can like still do watch it online and stuff.

914
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:16,340
Right.

915
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:22,100
Um, well, uh, we had trouble with it because they decided to use Google

916
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:26,380
meet for it, um, uh, instead of a streaming service, cause I put a lot of

917
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:30,220
work into the video, the video is going to be up and if people want it, just

918
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,700
ask me about it, I'll try to get it to you.

919
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:38,020
Um, but, um, it should hopefully be up by, uh, in Monday evening, um, on

920
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,060
capital city sisters.org.

921
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:44,180
Um, but, uh, I, we actually did get something else.

922
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:47,900
I don't know if I mentioned it before, but we got the new Jersey Jack

923
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,380
pirates of the Caribbean pinball.

924
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:51,060
And so I actually did play some of that.

925
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:53,380
Very loud, very fun.

926
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,540
Lots of, lots of modes.

927
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:59,060
It's pretty nuts, but the Jersey Jack games are pretty, pretty tops.

928
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:04,820
Um, Hindemith 1980, or excuse me, 1895 in chat says in response to, uh, what you

929
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:08,420
were saying, dark soccer, no projects, November.

930
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:14,740
Well, I might do, um, novel writing month, but it's more or less just a

931
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:20,820
catalyst to actually get my ass in gear to put this world that I've built in on

932
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:22,020
to quote paper.

933
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,020
Um, I am working on an urban fantasy novel.

934
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,100
Well, not really a novel.

935
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,340
I'm going to do it as a serial.

936
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:33,300
And it's, uh, when I get everything out and get everything ready to go, it's

937
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:38,820
going to be available through, uh, the Apple bookstore and, uh, uh, for Kindle.

938
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:43,540
Soon as I get all my, my ducks in a row, there'll be more about that, but I'm

939
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:44,100
announcing it here.

940
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:49,740
Now I'm writing a book, a serial serial series, not not Remo or whatever they call

941
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:54,940
it, not no national novel writing month, but I'm, I'm only using that as a

942
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:55,540
catalyst.

943
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:58,340
Um, I'm not doing a full novel.

944
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:00,260
I'm doing them as, as, as serial series.

945
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:06,740
I've also heard of non no pod Mo, which is, uh, do a podcast every day for a month.

946
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:09,620
Um, I know I've heard of that.

947
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:13,740
I know I've thought about participating, but, um, that's a lot of podcasts and it

948
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:14,860
would have to be a separate feed.

949
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:17,340
Cause I like, it's not going to happen on a well or anything like that.

950
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,980
Um, but like, just like a personal thing, but I don't know if I would have put it

951
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:21,780
together that fast.

952
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:22,140
We'll see.

953
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:28,060
No, I, I don't think I could do anything like that with a lot of, you know, a lot

954
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:29,100
of crap.

955
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:32,460
And tiger call says that I'm going to be a superstar author and my books are going

956
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:33,660
to get turned into movies.

957
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:38,380
Um, you don't want to know the weird shit that goes in my head that I'm thinking

958
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,660
about putting into a book.

959
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:48,860
Um, but I, I, I will tell people that the, the apocalypse is not what you think it

960
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:49,220
is.

961
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,500
You can, we can be living through one right now.

962
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:56,060
The it's not, it's not at all what people think it is.

963
00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:02,060
Post-apocalyptic is a genre for a different world.

964
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,820
You know, it don't, don't take that.

965
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,860
Why would I write a Garris Spock fanfic?

966
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,220
That's not a novel.

967
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,060
I do not write slash.

968
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:13,700
Okay.

969
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:18,860
I don't, um, I, I, I'm asexual.

970
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:20,140
I don't like writing that stuff.

971
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:25,900
Um, but anyway, um, but I'll have more about it as stuff comes out.

972
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,260
There'll be, there'll be things.

973
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:30,340
And of course I'll blog about it because I blog about every fucking thing now.

974
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:32,820
All right, fair enough.

975
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:34,220
Well, let's move on to Loki.

976
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:35,260
Loki, how was your gaming week?

977
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,060
Uh, well, let's see.

978
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:44,780
My gaming week was not playing games and it was just, uh, working on my game.

979
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:47,100
And that's pretty much what's going on.

980
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,180
I'm still not working.

981
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:49,340
It's still not working.

982
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:51,980
It's just frustrating me so much.

983
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:57,700
So I've been working on, um, a random spawning generator and I've run into

984
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:05,020
issues still in a fight for the last five days, so that that's been my week.

985
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:12,500
Um, I played Samorna as well, but, um, mostly just working on coding the entire

986
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:17,700
time, fair enough fighting, uh, it should be simple, but it's not working.

987
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:21,940
I look forward, um, to when we can finally play this game.

988
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:22,740
So I'm excited.

989
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:22,940
Yep.

990
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:23,660
All right.

991
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,660
Uh, good luck with all the bumps in the road.

992
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:30,940
Um, so my gaming week, um, has been kind of, you know, a same Z as previous weeks.

993
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:31,860
We already talked about, wow.

994
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:34,060
I already mentioned that Final Fantasy 14 still going.

995
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,260
This was the week.

996
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:41,020
So a couple nights ago, I finally hit level 80 max level level cap on every

997
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:43,220
single crafting and gathering class.

998
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:47,820
So there's like eight crafting classes, alchemy, carpentry, and so on.

999
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:48,420
Those types of things.

1000
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:51,420
And then three gathering classes, fishing, botany, mining.

1001
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,100
I hit 80 in all of them.

1002
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,180
So, and what do I get for that?

1003
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,020
I feel real good.

1004
00:51:59,140 --> 00:51:59,980
Ooh, I hope so.

1005
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:03,380
Cause I actually like candy corn on your, on your doorstep.

1006
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:07,140
Someone posted turkey dinner, candy corn, and I was, I was alarmed.

1007
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:10,660
I don't know about that, but they, they do like the maple candy corn.

1008
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,420
They have like other flavors this time of year.

1009
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:15,580
I like, I like the candy everybody hates.

1010
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:18,580
I like black jelly beans cause I like licorice.

1011
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,580
I like, I like it.

1012
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:22,340
I'm sorry.

1013
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:22,980
Not sorry.

1014
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:26,620
You and Dan can have all of that, but maybe I'll make candy

1015
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:28,020
corn cookies again this year.

1016
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:32,500
They're, they're kind of hard to do because the candy, uh, crystallizes,

1017
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:35,500
you know, into sheet candy if it's exposed out of the dough.

1018
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,580
So we'll see what happens.

1019
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:40,740
You know, the other thing, I know you're going to hate this Jamie plug your ears.

1020
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,700
I'm sorry, but the other big, big candy that I love that everybody

1021
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,580
hates, circus peanuts, love them.

1022
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:48,260
They're great.

1023
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:49,980
You, you can have them.

1024
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:50,420
Okay.

1025
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:50,660
Yeah.

1026
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,620
Just don't eat them in front of me because I will vomit.

1027
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:56,700
I would honestly have those than like a Hershey's bar.

1028
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:57,060
Really?

1029
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:58,060
I, anyway.

1030
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:58,460
All right.

1031
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,220
That's so there you go.

1032
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:01,020
Happy Halloween.

1033
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:02,940
I will get you peeps and that's all you get.

1034
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:04,860
All right.

1035
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,420
Uh, let's see.

1036
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:10,340
Um, so also for my gaming week, uh, I've been playing.

1037
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:11,820
So there was a couple new things.

1038
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:16,220
Um, I played that demo, so I guess I'm going to talk about this.

1039
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:18,260
I don't think I actually put this item in our news, but I'll

1040
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:19,340
talk about it a little early.

1041
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:23,140
So Google Stadia had a big thing, and I know that's coming up later in the

1042
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:26,740
news, uh, an event where they were talking about some new things that are coming.

1043
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:30,780
And one of the things they talked about was a Pac-Man style battle

1044
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:34,540
Royale game that's coming out first on Stadia and there's a demo.

1045
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:38,340
You can actually play online right now and you can check it out.

1046
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,940
And so I was like, eh, why not?

1047
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:40,820
I'm going to go check it out.

1048
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:44,740
So I played it a little bit and it seems to be a pretty feature filled

1049
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:48,580
demo, meaning you can pretty much play a match start to finish.

1050
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:52,060
I don't know what, I'm assuming the full game will have more

1051
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:53,700
customizations and other things you do.

1052
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,660
And I know the demo is also time limited.

1053
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:57,620
Like you can do it until October 27th.

1054
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:02,460
So I feel like, cause I don't always love to talk about demos as a review,

1055
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:06,260
but I do feel like this demo is intentionally set up to be pretty full featured.

1056
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:10,260
Um, it's not good.

1057
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:12,300
It's not fun.

1058
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:16,100
Um, it's, it's Pac-Man.

1059
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,940
Um, it's, it's here's, here's the problem with it.

1060
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:20,540
Like Pac-Man is a good game.

1061
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,420
That's fine.

1062
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:25,860
But look at how Pac-Man's really evolved over the years.

1063
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:26,300
Right.

1064
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:29,740
And the last few releases in the Pac-Man universe have been things like

1065
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:34,580
Pac-Man championship, Pac-Man championship edition, uh, Pac-Man championship

1066
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:37,540
edition two, those games are pretty fun.

1067
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,820
Uh, the music's great.

1068
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,340
They're pretty fast paced.

1069
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,500
It's intense.

1070
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:42,620
They're fun to play.

1071
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:46,580
Um, this Pac-Man tunnel battle royale thing, whatever it's called.

1072
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:47,500
I don't even remember the name of it.

1073
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,420
It's you, you here's the thing.

1074
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:52,540
I'm not even sure I understand what the fuck's going on, which

1075
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:53,780
is one problem I have with it.

1076
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:57,500
Um, but basically you're playing Pac-Man.

1077
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:00,340
Um, it's cartoony.

1078
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,020
It's cute.

1079
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,620
You can customize a lot.

1080
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:03,740
I guess that's a plus.

1081
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:10,300
Um, but the whole catch is you can open up the gates and instead of doing a

1082
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:14,660
tunnel to the other side of your map, you do a tunnel into someone else's map.

1083
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,380
I don't know why.

1084
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:22,100
I mean, you, you, I guess technically can eat a power pellet and try to kill them.

1085
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:27,140
Um, you can also take points and, and ghosts and stuff away from them.

1086
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:31,420
Um, but it's just, it's not interesting at all.

1087
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:33,660
It's just, it's not.

1088
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:38,980
Um, they tried to put some more power ups in the game to, uh, mix it up a little bit,

1089
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:42,620
like something that will make ghosts repel from you and do you see it?

1090
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:46,660
It's re it's a step backwards for Pac-Man.

1091
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:50,340
And I'm going to tell you what I've come on this show and talked about.

1092
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:52,260
I like Pac-Man championship edition.

1093
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:57,100
I liked Pac-Man chip addition to a lot more than most reviewers did.

1094
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:01,420
As much as the random ghost train on rail thing kind of bugged me too.

1095
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:06,660
I, I felt the style and substance and the way it kind of changed the game and, and the,

1096
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:09,260
the, the kind of the, just the joy I get out of playing it.

1097
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:12,620
I kind of felt balanced out some of those things here.

1098
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:18,060
It was just not interesting at all.

1099
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:20,860
I don't know what else to say.

1100
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:27,060
Like, um, let's see, I'm looking in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

1101
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:31,220
And, uh, Bobby is talking about if you take just the technology of the streaming 4k

1102
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:34,580
with low latency and that wifi controller, Stadia is amazing and wonderful.

1103
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:37,460
The problem is the service that is Stadia negates all the great tech.

1104
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:43,580
I got to admit it played all right, but it didn't, it didn't play as well as when I

1105
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:45,380
was playing like destiny two and stuff.

1106
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:50,860
It, I, I was getting more, more artifacting on fucking Pac-Man than I was when I was

1107
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:51,820
playing like destiny.

1108
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:55,540
Maybe that's just the nature of my connection today or what have you.

1109
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:59,100
I don't know if Alan was streaming something at the same time or what, but it

1110
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:00,660
just, wow.

1111
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:05,740
Uh, Questbuster says, I spectated a few games of that on Stadia and it was more

1112
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:06,340
Pac-Man.

1113
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,700
I didn't really feel compelled to play it though.

1114
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,100
Exactly.

1115
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:14,020
Here's, here's, here's the thing, and here's why I'm so negative on it.

1116
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:22,020
Is that obviously when we heard about this, we saw, Oh, it's Pac-Man, but it's a

1117
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,020
battle royale.

1118
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:26,340
That's it.

1119
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:28,700
That's what they did.

1120
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:36,340
I got nothing like it's, it's, it's, it's the most basic ass fucking game.

1121
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:39,660
If pumpkin spice were a video game, it would be this.

1122
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,460
That is how basic it is.

1123
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,220
But you like pumpkin spice.

1124
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:44,740
That's right.

1125
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:51,700
I like, I usually will defend pumpkin spice, but I can't, it's just, it's really

1126
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:52,940
bad you guys.

1127
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:54,740
And this is a demo.

1128
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,980
This is what they're trying to put out to save Stadia.

1129
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:02,740
Should we start playing Taps already?

1130
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,660
Uh, wait till the next segment.

1131
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:10,940
Um, but, uh, yeah, so that was, that was the Pac-Man game.

1132
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:11,460
I'm sorry.

1133
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:14,340
I, I really want to love the game cause I loved Pac-Man.

1134
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:16,060
I just don't, it's not good.

1135
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:17,700
Um, okay.

1136
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:21,260
Uh, so let's see what else, uh, did I play this week?

1137
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:24,980
I felt like there was one other game, but I'm so, so bent on that out of shape on

1138
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:25,420
that game.

1139
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:26,580
I can't even remember what it was.

1140
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:27,980
I did play a little more Hades.

1141
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:29,100
Oh, I know the game.

1142
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:35,460
Um, I went into the Super Nintendo emulator on, uh, the official one on the

1143
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:39,460
Switch, Nintendo online, and I started playing Mario's P-Cross.

1144
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:44,300
Because P-Cross is very Zen and relaxing and kind of fun.

1145
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:46,660
Um, and I, I enjoy it.

1146
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:52,580
So, uh, I played, I played all of round one on the Mario side, a plot twist,

1147
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:53,860
minor spoiler alert.

1148
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,260
So I did all of that.

1149
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:57,460
So, uh, and that was more fun than Pac-Man.

1150
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:00,620
All right, let's get into some news.

1151
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,780
I don't think I have anything else to discuss.

1152
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,580
Uh, that's about it.

1153
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:09,060
So let's get into, uh, what else is going on in the gaming world in the news.

1154
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:11,140
So Loki, why don't you start us off?

1155
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:15,220
Yes, let's, let's talk about some more stadia stuff.

1156
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:22,620
So, um, there was an interesting tweet exchanges, uh, going on with the creative

1157
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:29,260
director at Typhoon studios, Alex Hutchinson, who has, um, of course their

1158
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:35,500
studio was bought by Google's, um, by Google last year and is actually making

1159
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,380
stadia games.

1160
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:41,540
He, um, brought the wonderful hot take that, you know, what talking about, you

1161
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:45,420
know, all these DMCA things that are going on with, uh, the music and stuff on

1162
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:45,900
Twitch.

1163
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:50,820
Um, he also brought up the thing saying, Hey, streamers worried about getting

1164
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:55,340
their content pulled because they use music and didn't pay for, uh, should be

1165
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:58,740
more worried by the fact that they're streaming games that didn't pay for as

1166
00:59:58,740 --> 00:59:59,180
well.

1167
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:00,180
It's all gone.

1168
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:03,820
As soon as the publisher decides to enforce it, the real truth is streamers

1169
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:07,460
should be paying the developers and publishers of the games they stream.

1170
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:12,260
They should be buying a license like any real business and pay for the content

1171
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:12,780
they use.

1172
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:17,820
Well, of course that was received very well by everybody and no one had any

1173
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:18,500
issues with it.

1174
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:24,540
Of course, um, everybody had issues with it and, uh, there's a lot of

1175
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:25,780
interesting feedback.

1176
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:32,180
This is also the same guy that, uh, was complaining a while back about how he

1177
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:37,700
felt that Japanese games get kind of a pass by media outlets when they're,

1178
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:41,580
um, reviewing them versus, um, American games.

1179
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:45,540
Cause he was the creative director at, on Assassin's Creed three at one time.

1180
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:46,820
As well.

1181
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:51,900
Um, you know, comparing his games to, you know, basically like, um, super

1182
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:53,260
Mario brothers or stuff like that.

1183
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:55,380
He's all, why did they get to make games in the same thing?

1184
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:57,660
And people just kind of love those.

1185
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:03,740
It must be because there's some sort of, uh, subtle racism in the business

1186
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:05,180
on the journalist side.

1187
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:08,540
So yeah, he's full of hot takes.

1188
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:10,780
Uh, of course, no, nobody liked it.

1189
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:15,340
Um, no, no, but you sound like a telltale game.

1190
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:16,300
It just popped up in the corner.

1191
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:17,540
Nobody liked that.

1192
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:18,860
Yeah.

1193
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:22,140
So Google, of course, you know, basically saying, Hey, uh, the recent

1194
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:25,380
tweets by Alex Hutchinson, creative director at Montreal studio of

1195
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:26,820
stadia games entertainment.

1196
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:30,180
Do not reflect those of stadia YouTube or Google.

1197
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:34,620
Yeah, but you know why he's, he's representing a company.

1198
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:38,980
He's one of your, and he kind of missed, I don't want, I don't know if

1199
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:40,780
you'd say he misrepresented himself.

1200
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:45,180
I kind of think that's a accurate way to say it, but, um,

1201
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:45,900
let's see.

1202
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:51,580
So it says, uh, creative director at S S G and E Montreal studio is what

1203
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:55,180
it says now, but that's not what it said before it said creative

1204
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:58,700
director at, uh, Google stadia.

1205
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:01,020
Is what it said before.

1206
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:02,540
Yeah.

1207
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:05,220
So, so he changed it there.

1208
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:05,660
Yeah.

1209
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:11,020
I mean, so the kind of pick it apart, obviously it's a weird take from

1210
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:15,980
somebody that's making stadia games on a device that literally one of the

1211
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:20,900
features that, Hey, you can stream your games on YouTube straight out of,

1212
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:23,460
straight up using the service.

1213
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:26,420
It's like, what are you doing?

1214
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:32,380
I mean, as it is, it's hard enough to sell stadia as like a device that

1215
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:36,700
people want to use because of their service and just the way it's structured.

1216
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,620
It's not very good.

1217
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:39,020
Yeah.

1218
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:42,500
And now you have somebody that's like, you know, you should be

1219
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,300
paying us because we're so good.

1220
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:45,100
I'm sorry.

1221
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:47,580
No, no, that's not it.

1222
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:52,180
I understand the argument, but it's also, you know, it's a bad take.

1223
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:57,700
It's just like, there's a lot of companies right now, especially with

1224
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:02,140
like, you know, the new X-Box and the new PlayStation systems coming out

1225
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:07,180
that they're engaging with streamers to get the hype out about, you know,

1226
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:08,660
those systems they're paying them.

1227
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:12,740
And, you know, obviously there's this kind of synergy between, you know,

1228
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:18,100
content creators and these hardware platforms or even software platforms

1229
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:19,580
to be able to promote their stuff.

1230
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,340
And I'm sorry that he doesn't get that.

1231
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:28,100
Um, yeah, even, even your cat, Stella has a hot take on what this guy had to say.

1232
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:29,540
She's just being irritating.

1233
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:31,460
It's more, more treats.

1234
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:34,900
She's been receiving treats all day long and she knows I'm on a call.

1235
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:37,140
Obviously now's the time.

1236
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:38,660
Yeah.

1237
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:42,500
And I, I agree with Bobby in chat, who's basically saying he'll be fine.

1238
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,620
People will forget his comments soon and he'll still be

1239
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:45,780
working in the game industry.

1240
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:46,740
I agree.

1241
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,220
Like people it's going to blow over.

1242
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:48,540
It is.

1243
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:52,660
But I, this is one of those things where I, I don't think it's so much about

1244
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:54,940
what he said, but it's how you say it.

1245
01:03:55,300 --> 01:04:00,620
And I think he just came off as like, so smug and so, and I, I would like to

1246
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:05,980
compliment myself because I felt my drags in response on Twitter were really good.

1247
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:07,540
I'd like to share them with you now.

1248
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:13,300
So in response, I wrote, people can't stream Google Stadia effectively because

1249
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:17,340
they need that bandwidth to play the games and how's that lack of community

1250
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:19,300
for your product working out in sales.

1251
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:21,060
I thought that was a good drag.

1252
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:24,500
Now here's, yeah, there is like some digs that he made against like

1253
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,140
giant bomb and stuff like that.

1254
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:28,380
And it's like, you know, here's the thing.

1255
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:30,620
And I'm going to elaborate on this tweet too.

1256
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:35,100
While I agree, and this is my tweet, while I agree something like a jukebox

1257
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:39,780
license should exist for streamers and I'd be open to some sort of revenue

1258
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:44,540
share with developers, these industries are too slow to come up with something

1259
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:49,260
just like Google Stadia was too slow to release outside Chromecast before X cloud

1260
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:53,740
and Luna, you work in tech for Christ's sake, evolve or die.

1261
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:56,380
And that is basically what it is for me.

1262
01:04:56,660 --> 01:05:04,540
And I, I actually don't necessarily disagree that the clock is ticking in of

1263
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:10,420
sorts for when are some video game companies going to start to say, maybe

1264
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:12,100
we don't want you streaming our game.

1265
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:15,380
And to be fair, that has already happened to some extent on YouTube, right?

1266
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:19,500
We've heard about companies leveraging that DMC 80 at certain videos taken down.

1267
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:23,540
Nintendo didn't have a great take on this in the beginning either.

1268
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:26,300
So yeah, they took that approach.

1269
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:27,260
Nintendo took that approach.

1270
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:31,020
They thought that they, you were playing their games, you should pay

1271
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:33,380
them for the right to do that online.

1272
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:35,260
And that's the approach that they took.

1273
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:38,780
And, and they did that and obviously they backed away from it.

1274
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:43,900
So it wasn't working out well for them, I would assume because it's either it.

1275
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:49,220
It shines poorly on them, like that they're not embracing their community

1276
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:51,980
or that the money wasn't worth it.

1277
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:56,780
I don't know, wherever the case may be, they backed away from it for a reason.

1278
01:05:56,940 --> 01:06:02,900
So just, you know, let's just say, for example, that this Stadia studio or

1279
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:06,900
whatever wants to take that approach, which is really stupid on their

1280
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:09,700
device that you has that built in.

1281
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:12,140
So let's just say they're stupid enough to do that.

1282
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:16,180
There are tons of other companies out there that will

1283
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,500
let you play their games for free.

1284
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:22,460
I'm pretty sure that the developers behind Among Us probably don't care.

1285
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:24,740
So if, if you have these companies, that's fine.

1286
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:28,740
You know, these AAA studios can go ahead and take that stance and do that, but

1287
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:32,740
there's always going to be independent developers or even AAA studios that

1288
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:39,660
don't share that same opinion and I'm sorry, but eventually, you know, you'll

1289
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:44,980
find that your games get less exposure because you're just, you put up roadblocks.

1290
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:50,100
I, I actually, I actually kind of agree with you for the most part on this.

1291
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:54,540
I think it's one of those, if, and that's why I'm kind of like, it would be nice if

1292
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:59,380
they would come up with something, a fair system so that if a developer wants,

1293
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:01,220
they can get a cut of profits.

1294
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:05,180
Now, I believe before you all start dragging me, I believe

1295
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:07,220
it should be at a threshold.

1296
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:11,620
I don't think somebody who's making, you know, the bare minimum to be an affiliate

1297
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:16,740
on Twitch and bringing in simple dollars and cents every month on Twitch should be

1298
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:19,980
somebody that should be subject to those type of guidelines, but I think once you

1299
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:23,940
hit a certain threshold and you're at these, you know, I'm making a living off

1300
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:28,740
of it type of things, I think there maybe is room for a conversation about what

1301
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:32,940
should a developer be entitled to in those cases, but, and this is where I

1302
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:37,380
agree with Loki, I think a developer should have the right to say, we're not,

1303
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,660
we don't, we want you to be able to stream this for free.

1304
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:42,420
We're not interested in claiming that we want to encourage you to

1305
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:44,860
stream our game by doing that.

1306
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:49,300
And I think if you do that, then I think the rest of what Loki says absolutely

1307
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:52,940
comes true is that the streaming market starts to gravitate towards those games

1308
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:57,820
and the market kind of work, it's works itself out, but I do think we need to

1309
01:07:57,820 --> 01:08:02,580
have a little more definitive guidance in a legal sense so that this isn't

1310
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:04,300
such a gray area anymore.

1311
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:10,500
I, I, because, because unfortunately, even though the way he said it was kind

1312
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:14,340
of crappy where he's, you know, especially as somebody who works in the game

1313
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,980
industry, he did have a point.

1314
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:23,100
If these guys, if the game makers want to come in and start shutting things

1315
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:28,420
down, they could, and I'll tell you, and with all that stuff, I just try.

1316
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:30,380
Yeah, like seriously, like just let him try.

1317
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:35,060
Well, Nintendo did, Nintendo did, and they, maybe not on Twitch, but they did

1318
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:37,980
on YouTube, but I also think, so everything I just said, Loki, cause

1319
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:39,140
here's the thing it's funny.

1320
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:41,660
Nintendo is always the rule breaker.

1321
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:43,300
And I think this would be no different.

1322
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:46,580
I think if rules were to be set, I think Nintendo would be like, oh yeah,

1323
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:47,940
we're claiming max share.

1324
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:51,900
And I really think Nintendo fans, like, I'm sorry, but Nintendo fans wouldn't

1325
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:54,700
care because Nintendo fans are willing to die on their sword for Nintendo.

1326
01:08:55,780 --> 01:09:00,220
I just feel like that again, it would be an anomaly, but at least

1327
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:01,460
we'd have an answer.

1328
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:04,700
And at least we wouldn't be sitting here saying it's a gray area.

1329
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:06,340
It would no longer be a gray area.

1330
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:11,060
But the problem is, sorry, Loki, the problem is, but, but I'm, it's a

1331
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:14,140
callback because go back to what we were just talking about at the top of the

1332
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:18,700
show with AOC and her live stream, no matter how you feel about AOC.

1333
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:20,220
And I think, Loki, it was you that said.

1334
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:25,220
It felt a lot better than just an old, a bunch of old people standing

1335
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:26,620
around talking about politics.

1336
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:27,820
That's not very interesting.

1337
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:29,660
And I think that's it.

1338
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:30,580
That's the disconnect.

1339
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:34,900
We need people like AOC and fight, let's say Justin Amash too,

1340
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:35,860
because he's on the right.

1341
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:36,180
Fine.

1342
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:37,460
Let them come together.

1343
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:43,580
We need these younger folks that get it to come together and talk about trademark

1344
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:49,820
laws and rule and, and, um, uh, copyright and modernizing these types of things

1345
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:52,580
for what makes sense in the year 2020.

1346
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:55,820
The whole DMCA needs to be rewritten and whole copyright law

1347
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:57,300
needs to be rewritten anyways.

1348
01:09:57,540 --> 01:09:58,980
It's just well outdated.

1349
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:01,700
It's been driven by Disney too.

1350
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:06,980
It's just, I just say it's been, um, what's the right word here?

1351
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:14,260
Uh, exploited, exploited by Disney, um, to an nth degree.

1352
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:15,580
I mean, it's ridiculous.

1353
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:21,300
And so there needs to, it needs to be modernized and, you know, put in place

1354
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:26,420
to where fair use is actually something that is considered because I know it is

1355
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:29,740
written in that they have to consider fair use, but they don't because there's

1356
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:32,500
no, there's no sort of punishment.

1357
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:38,220
If a big company, like say, you know, Warner music doesn't, uh, follow fair

1358
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:40,100
use because what are you going to do?

1359
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:43,100
You little person, you know, individual person that has no money, you're

1360
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:44,700
going to fight a huge corporation.

1361
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:49,060
Yeah, there's no sorts of, you know, repercussion for them.

1362
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:50,940
So the laws need to be rewritten.

1363
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:51,340
Loki.

1364
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:53,820
I do want to jump in because the, the live fact checking

1365
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:55,060
that happens in our chat room.

1366
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:58,300
This is worth saying, uh, like what company has done it.

1367
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:01,140
And actually a couple of people act deft and Bobby both chiming in.

1368
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,420
Atlas did it with persona.

1369
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:06,820
If you went too far into persona, they DMC aid people.

1370
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:11,420
It's it's only one example that we can really think of in recent memory, but it

1371
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:15,100
has happened, so there is proof that companies will use it if they feel like

1372
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:19,060
they need to, so, I don't know.

1373
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:23,140
Uh, dark Sakura, what do you, what do you, what do you think the rules should be?

1374
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:25,620
Or do you think where's your head out with all this?

1375
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:27,780
Do you think game companies should be entitled to some money?

1376
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:29,780
Do you think it's too far gone?

1377
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:31,300
Do we need to have a conversation?

1378
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:32,260
What's, what's your opinion?

1379
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:38,860
I think if anything, that the places that offer the streaming service need

1380
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:44,660
to have some sort of licensing deal with some of these companies, I

1381
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:50,420
think on behalf of the users, I mean, users are getting a kick in for, you

1382
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:57,380
know, like sort of direct payments, but, um, there's also the subscriber

1383
01:11:57,380 --> 01:12:00,260
fees and everything, the more subscribers, you know, if anything,

1384
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:03,820
maybe bump up a subscription by a dollar, have that go into paying

1385
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:07,980
licensing charges and keep it off of the people who are providing the content.

1386
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:11,300
Or how about let's not pay these companies any more money because

1387
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:14,180
they're already making tons of money from all the microtransactions and

1388
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:16,860
stuff that they're throwing in and pretending these multi-billion dollar

1389
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:18,940
companies, not all of them.

1390
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:22,340
There are other companies that would benefit from having a deal like that.

1391
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:26,780
I understand that, but the ones that are complaining about it, Google, or I

1392
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:31,060
should say this developer of Google, it's owned by Google, whatever, I'm

1393
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:34,420
going to lump them in, you know, complaining multi-billion dollar

1394
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:37,980
companies that are complaining that they are not receiving enough money for

1395
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:41,500
their games, that's why they're charging $70 for their brand new games with

1396
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:46,380
season, multiple season passes and DLC on top of that and special editions

1397
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:51,820
on top of that and cosmetics on top of all of that, I mean, like, I

1398
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:55,580
can't feel bad for you when you're giving your CEO several hundred

1399
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:59,980
millions of dollars it's, or tens of millions of dollars, you know, as a

1400
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:02,580
bonus, sorry, don't feel bad for you.

1401
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:06,260
So no, I don't think you need to make more money, especially, you

1402
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:07,580
know, gatekeeping this stuff.

1403
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:10,500
And if you really want to do that, I'm sorry, but there's plenty of

1404
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:15,460
other companies out there that won't necessarily go that route and they

1405
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:19,260
could go very well the same way as Twitch, where Twitch has like kind of

1406
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:23,340
this white listed music selection that you can choose from, then you can

1407
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:25,780
have a white listed game selection you can choose from.

1408
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:26,340
Well, let's go back to the music scene.

1409
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:32,860
I was still making a point before, saying that I still stand by what I

1410
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:38,700
said, it's a way to get the big companies off of people's back and it's

1411
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:43,220
a way to offer freedom for the streamers that want to do, I mean, the

1412
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:45,780
big companies are going to do what they can to be richer and richer.

1413
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:46,820
That's all there is to it.

1414
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:49,860
My point is living in the real world.

1415
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:55,220
We should have a way that they get, you know, their little, what, two

1416
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:59,980
cents on every game that's, uh, that's played on a stream and stay

1417
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:04,100
off of the players backs, realistically.

1418
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:07,580
That's kind of where I, and I think there is an intersection here where

1419
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:10,100
you guys actually really do agree because it's where I'm at too.

1420
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:12,660
And that is, we've got to get out of this gray area.

1421
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:14,820
That is that, that, and that is what it is.

1422
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:18,980
We may not ultimately like the result, but it, and what you're saying, Jamie,

1423
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:22,180
it's going to get us out of the gray area and that's the most important thing.

1424
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:23,740
And I totally agree with that.

1425
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:28,500
Now, well, like with, with music streaming services, for example, right.

1426
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:34,820
All these companies, they do pay licensing fees to, you know, whatever

1427
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:38,100
the production company, et cetera, you know, who owns the rights to

1428
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:39,540
the music, whatever publisher.

1429
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:43,220
It's going to be this, I think it's going to be the same thing.

1430
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:47,500
You know, you have that one licensing charge that they have with major,

1431
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:50,620
with major companies, you know, maybe have a coalition though, for the

1432
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:54,220
smaller, for the independent ones have like some sort of deal with them.

1433
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:59,700
That then say, well, I want to step in and get a little bit off, you know,

1434
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:03,660
for my games that they signed into this, you know, agreement or

1435
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:05,100
whatever they can afford to do.

1436
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:09,060
But, you know, it's like active, just said in chat, the companies only

1437
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:13,100
care about money, so give them something to shut them the fuck

1438
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:14,420
up and let us have our games.

1439
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:17,700
Well, and it's, it's funny you bring that up as a solution because I, I

1440
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:20,900
really think now going back to the music side of things, I think the

1441
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:25,620
music industry, of course, as always is being slow to evolve and ridiculous

1442
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:31,100
and really short-sighted and losing potential money by not, and not even

1443
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:36,420
the cool kind of petty like Lori petty, but they are like being really

1444
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:41,500
ridiculous in not offering something similar to a jukebox license.

1445
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:46,260
So that streamers can just have music in the backgrounds of their streams

1446
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:47,580
and not have to worry about it.

1447
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:51,380
Something similar to what, you know, like a small business or, you know,

1448
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:55,020
like a small streamer license, you know, and it, maybe it's not going to be

1449
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:58,060
the type of money that everybody's going to want to pay, but at least

1450
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:00,900
again, you'd have something to get you out of that gray area anyway.

1451
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:05,380
Well, in a perfect world, these, these companies would actually be

1452
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:10,220
held accountable for paying their taxes, saying the, you know, people

1453
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:14,820
who make stupid amounts of money over 400,000, you know, a year, they would

1454
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:15,580
get taxed.

1455
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:20,540
So I'm just saying, you know, this goes into a bigger picture.

1456
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:21,940
We may be looking at it.

1457
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:25,660
This, this being one symptom of a problem, but we've got a bigger picture

1458
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:26,780
that will be solved by voting.

1459
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:27,420
Just saying.

1460
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:31,460
Um, Loki, I'm going to do something a little weird here and go out of order

1461
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:35,540
because it just makes no sense to not pair this with your next story.

1462
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:38,020
Can we hop ahead to the other story about Twitch?

1463
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:38,340
I'm sorry.

1464
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:40,100
It just makes sense to couple this here.

1465
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:41,500
Just so unprepared.

1466
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:43,980
We're having this discussion already.

1467
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:45,180
We got to bring this up.

1468
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:51,140
So bringing up the RIA, of course, there was this huge, massive, uh, DMCA

1469
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:53,260
purge and it's by Twitch.

1470
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:57,740
The issue is it's kind of a compound issue.

1471
01:16:57,740 --> 01:17:03,580
So one, apparently Twitch was receiving, I think these DMCA take down

1472
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:07,740
notices for a while now they've been backing up since the summer.

1473
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:13,300
And now they just sent out information to streamers, letting them know that

1474
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:19,340
one of your pieces of content has, you know, a piece of music or whatever,

1475
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:22,140
and it that's been hit by this and you need to delete it.

1476
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:25,300
And if you don't know which one it is, well, just delete all of them.

1477
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:27,300
Cause they're not going to tell you which one it is.

1478
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:31,140
Which people are doing, which is ridiculous and stupid.

1479
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:33,940
Like just incredibly stupid.

1480
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:36,140
You have apparently, yeah, these claims have gone back since the

1481
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:40,860
beginning of back in June, um, that they were happening and they finally

1482
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:45,580
got around in, which I mean, clearly they're not following, you know,

1483
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:47,300
Twitch is not following the law here.

1484
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:51,980
Um, could make them lose their safe harbor status being that they've waited

1485
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:54,500
so long to respond to these claims.

1486
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:58,700
Um, but yeah, it's just, it's a problem because they're going to have, people

1487
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:01,420
are having to mass delete these videos.

1488
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:07,620
Um, all their VODs and everything are going to be gone because they don't know

1489
01:18:07,780 --> 01:18:12,820
which clip it is that they're claiming, which I also think is not necessarily

1490
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:20,300
following the rule of the law for DMC on this stuff, so I don't know.

1491
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:25,020
Um, I haven't gotten a strike, so I'm aware.

1492
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:28,260
Just for the record, VOG network did not receive one of these and I didn't

1493
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:32,140
get one on my personal channel either, but I, I've generally been pretty

1494
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:34,140
aware about this type of thing.

1495
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:37,180
And I've kind of, you know, I just kind of know like, okay, if I play

1496
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:41,340
something like Forza Horizon, I'm going to play on the classical music station.

1497
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:43,620
That's not going to get, you know, struck a strike.

1498
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:47,700
I don't do the whole like Spotify, iTunes, whatever, playing

1499
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:48,780
potpourri in the background.

1500
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:49,540
I don't really do that.

1501
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:51,500
Um, it's usually always the music in the game.

1502
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:56,100
Um, and, uh, unfortunately, and I'm, I'm kind of with, uh, what, uh, see

1503
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,420
Black and Pat had a comment earlier.

1504
01:18:57,420 --> 01:18:58,100
I was going to read, Oh yeah.

1505
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:00,860
I've been looking forward to playing harmonics, new game fuser

1506
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:01,940
when it comes out next month.

1507
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:02,300
Me too.

1508
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:05,580
Uh, but I know I won't be able to play it on stream because I'll be

1509
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:07,540
DMCA'd within an inch of our life.

1510
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:10,100
Yeah, totally, uh, where I'm at as well.

1511
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:11,820
Um, so yeah.

1512
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:14,860
And Bobby says technically they could still strike the classical music

1513
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:18,060
station because it's the recording that's copywritten and the classical

1514
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:20,820
music station does have music written in the 20th century.

1515
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:24,180
So, um, fair point, but it's, it's, it's jet.

1516
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:25,500
I've generally, I've been okay.

1517
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:28,180
I found, I did not get hit with one of these knock on wood.

1518
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:29,700
Um, but I would do that.

1519
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:33,220
I who's going to watch my Forza horizon four stream from like three years ago.

1520
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:35,340
Like I would do the same thing other people are doing.

1521
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:37,740
And if I started getting these notices, I'd probably just delete

1522
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:41,820
everything, um, which sucks, but yeah.

1523
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:47,420
So, um, orange rice says I didn't get the email either.

1524
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:49,020
Uh, and, uh, interesting.

1525
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:51,300
I wanted to read this from a quest buster.

1526
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:53,740
Cause I thought this was very interesting that I wasn't even aware of this.

1527
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:59,460
As a side note, Facebook gaming already has licensing details with the likes

1528
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:04,420
of universal Sony and BMG to allow their streamers to play music during their

1529
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:09,380
streams, at least those that have partner status still at something that's better

1530
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:11,740
than nothing, even though it's Facebook.

1531
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:14,540
Um, yeah, that's, uh, very well said.

1532
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:18,060
Um, so, but it also does show that the platform, i.e.

1533
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:22,580
Twitch could negotiate something at that level if they wanted to, but Twitch seems

1534
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:26,380
to be a little more on this whole, which isn't necessarily bad, like I'm not

1535
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:30,900
critical of this, but is on this more, we're doing this Twitch safe label with

1536
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:35,220
indie stuff and because that's what they want to push and we all know that that

1537
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:36,460
type of thing is going to be cheaper.

1538
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:40,460
But, uh, who am I to complain about them wanting to push indie music?

1539
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:41,900
I don't think that's such a bad thing.

1540
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:48,860
Um, this is interesting, but, uh, yeah, it, the fact that you can't counterclaim

1541
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:53,500
some of these things and that you're not really told a lot of the reasons, that's

1542
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:58,460
the part that's kind of dicey and bad, that's following that a lot of these

1543
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:01,020
violations and that falls on Twitch, that falls on Twitch.

1544
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:02,060
Yeah.

1545
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:06,660
Well, not having the counterclaim process, I think it goes against DMCA as well.

1546
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:11,940
Um, I think a lot of what they've done could get themselves into a lot of

1547
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:16,740
trouble with these music labels because they didn't follow the letter of the law.

1548
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:23,300
I mean, in ignoring it for four months, not that, I mean, they could easily

1549
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:24,860
be taking the court for that stuff.

1550
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:32,180
I think this is just trying to save face right now, but like, yeah, I don't know.

1551
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:38,100
It's not, that's, I can't imagine that they didn't know this was a problem.

1552
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:41,060
Um, Questbuster in chat says a number of big streamers have already said they've

1553
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:44,100
decided to just wipe out thousands of VODs to be safe.

1554
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:50,820
And to be, to be fair, VODs aren't exactly where it's at on Twitch.

1555
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:57,620
Like Twitch has not done a very good job of competing with YouTube on the VOD level.

1556
01:21:57,620 --> 01:22:01,460
And I know it's ironic cause I talk about the VODs here of the show and so forth.

1557
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:06,500
Yes, they are available, but they're not really that well utilized.

1558
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:10,980
Like there's a couple of people that will watch the VODs of this show and I see you.

1559
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:11,220
Hi.

1560
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:12,020
Thanks for being there.

1561
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:17,300
I appreciate it, but it's not nearly the number that watch live or that watch on

1562
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:18,580
the podcast feed.

1563
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:22,260
And I think for anything else, my personal channel, there might be one or two people

1564
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:23,780
that were where it's completely open.

1565
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:25,300
I don't have subs or anything.

1566
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:29,460
Um, I might have one or two people that watch a VOD, but I have way more that

1567
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:30,580
watch it live.

1568
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:35,780
Like Twitch's area that they, they are do well in is live.

1569
01:22:35,780 --> 01:22:40,020
So maybe in a way that's what makes it easy, quote unquote, for a lot of streamers to

1570
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:44,420
throw things away is because it's like, eh, VOD isn't really where it's at anyway.

1571
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:49,700
It's all about getting those subscriptions and bits and so forth in a live environment.

1572
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:51,460
Cause that isn't coming in on the VODs.

1573
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:56,420
So, uh, Bobby in chat says even the clips aren't safe.

1574
01:22:56,420 --> 01:23:00,020
And if there's something we do on our shows, that's extremely heavy on the video.

1575
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:01,460
We post it to YouTube.

1576
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:02,100
Yeah.

1577
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:07,540
So, uh, and Phoenix 77 26 says this will lead to DMCA abuse.

1578
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:10,180
I sadly, I see that coming too.

1579
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:14,020
So there needs to be a way to kind of respond.

1580
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:18,260
It took YouTube forever to get there, but at least they have something in place now.

1581
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:20,500
So it's, um, yeah, the whole thing's a little bit scary.

1582
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:21,220
But not much.

1583
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:25,460
I mean, it, there's nothing that really sought people from making false DMCA claims.

1584
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:26,740
So Ray.

1585
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:27,860
Yeah.

1586
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:28,740
Very, very for that.

1587
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:29,860
All right.

1588
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:30,820
Well, let's move on.

1589
01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:34,660
Uh, I'm going to talk about the next story here, which has to do with, this is pretty

1590
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:39,540
exciting and something I really wish Nintendo would have embraced this stuff a lot sooner,

1591
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:40,420
but fine.

1592
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:41,300
We're here.

1593
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:42,100
Yay.

1594
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:48,660
The original NES fire emblem game is going to get a localization and come to the U S

1595
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:50,260
for the very first time.

1596
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:57,060
Sort of, there was a remake that happened on DS 3DS, but this is, this is the true original

1597
01:23:57,060 --> 01:23:59,620
NES rom from 1990.

1598
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:03,380
That's coming out, which is a fire emblem, shadow dragon, and the blade of light.

1599
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:11,300
Interesting enough, this game is already part of the switch online program in Japan.

1600
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:17,860
So if you open up the Famicom library in Japan and which you can do, uh, even with an American

1601
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:21,700
account, all you need is just a Japanese account temporarily to go to the eShop and download

1602
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:22,900
the Famicom player.

1603
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:25,140
But once you do that, you're not breaking any laws doing it.

1604
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:26,900
The switch is a region free system.

1605
01:24:27,780 --> 01:24:34,180
You can go in and play this game already with your switch online in Japanese, but they're

1606
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:39,300
going to be localizing it for the U S and because of that, it's not just going into

1607
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:42,740
the switch online library, which I think is going to make a lot of people frown.

1608
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:48,180
But they are going to sell it separately as a $6 game or $5.99.

1609
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:54,420
It's another limited time release, meaning you will only be able to get it through March

1610
01:24:54,420 --> 01:25:03,060
31st, 2021, which is a whole other, I don't understand this, outside of they are trying

1611
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:08,980
to inflate their, um, because notice that March 31st is no coincidence.

1612
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:10,900
That's the end of the fiscal year.

1613
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:14,900
They're trying to sandbag as much as they can to sell in the physicals.

1614
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:18,820
They don't really have a gigantic holiday release to buoy them.

1615
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:20,900
Mario 3D All-Stars is it.

1616
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:25,140
And then otherwise they're relying on third parties, like, um, probably the Hyrule Warriors

1617
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:28,260
2 is kind of like the other big holiday release, which really isn't their game.

1618
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:30,500
But it is their IP, obviously.

1619
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:33,300
Anyway, that's a whole other discussion.

1620
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:40,100
But what is pretty cool is that, um, there's going to be a $50 physical version of this

1621
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:47,780
with an NES style box, replica game cartridge, 200 page art book, and a download code.

1622
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:49,940
Because obviously you can't just put a cartridge in your switch.

1623
01:25:49,940 --> 01:25:53,620
Well, I guess you can, but they're not going to bother just putting this tiny, like an

1624
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:59,220
NES cartridge or like, it's an NES style box and replica game cartridge.

1625
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:01,460
So you can't actually put it there rep.

1626
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:03,780
So you can't actually put it in a Nintendo.

1627
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:06,500
It's a rep it's for looks only.

1628
01:26:07,060 --> 01:26:08,500
So, okay.

1629
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:09,220
Yeah.

1630
01:26:09,220 --> 01:26:14,340
But anyway, uh, that is, and then it's a translated game manual that you get in a fold out world

1631
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:19,780
map now for collectors, especially people that really love their eight bit NES libraries.

1632
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:24,740
That part is pretty cool because that isn't even like something, oh, limited run games

1633
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:28,020
who does these types of Nintendo's doing it.

1634
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:29,220
So that's neat.

1635
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:30,580
I'm going to give them credit for that.

1636
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:34,660
But I just, I hate the whole limited time release thing for one.

1637
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:41,620
Um, I actually, I'm not as hateful on the $6 surcharge as others might be.

1638
01:26:41,620 --> 01:26:46,020
I get that localization isn't free and they're going to need to pay people to do that and

1639
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:46,420
so forth.

1640
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:53,140
So I'm not, I still think there would have been value for Nintendo to put that into switch

1641
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:58,820
online because that library is really slowing down and it's not as amazing as it used to

1642
01:26:58,820 --> 01:26:59,140
be.

1643
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:02,900
But I just sat here and talked at the top of the show about playing Mario P cross.

1644
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:04,180
So maybe I'm wrong.

1645
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:07,940
Um, I don't know what low key dark soccer.

1646
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:08,580
What do you guys think?

1647
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:11,940
I'm not a fan of fire emblem.

1648
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:19,700
So yeah, I'm probably gonna get it just to have it for reasons.

1649
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:21,380
Dan likes fire emblem, so we'll see.

1650
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:25,860
I'm also just not as big on fire emblem as a series, but I'm really happy for those people

1651
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:28,900
that are like, I'm not, I'm not a hater either, but yeah, I'm definitely one of those people

1652
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:32,420
that's like, so if this does well, does this mean mother three?

1653
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:35,940
That's I'm definitely never going to get you what you want.

1654
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:43,380
No, for the record, Rob and release, I have the translated, uh, uh, cartridge for mother

1655
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:44,420
three if you will.

1656
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:48,100
Yeah, they're, they're out there, but I would love to see Nintendo embrace it.

1657
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:50,260
You know, that's, that's the, that's the thing.

1658
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:50,900
I'm just joking.

1659
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:52,660
I've never played any of the earthbound series.

1660
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:55,460
So, you know, Oh, you should, do I care about mother three?

1661
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:59,460
Um, Bobby black over chat says, uh, I think the surcharges for the added features, they're

1662
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:02,820
adding more in game options, like rewinding a turn.

1663
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:05,140
So it's not just the straight ROM.

1664
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:11,300
Um, you could like the, the online emulator, you can do a rewind.

1665
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:14,980
I'm not sure it's this, like, even in the Japanese Famicom, you can do like a real one.

1666
01:28:14,980 --> 01:28:17,380
I'm not sure it's implemented the same way.

1667
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:18,660
So I'll give you that.

1668
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:23,700
But, um, yeah, I mean, I, I, again, I'm actually not upset about the $6 surcharge.

1669
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:24,260
Like I get it.

1670
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:28,820
There's things that go into it, but I also think Nintendo could have weighed, would there

1671
01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:34,020
have been value in just putting it in the library anyway and not doing a surcharge,

1672
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:36,580
but that was their decision to make, I think.

1673
01:28:36,580 --> 01:28:39,060
So, um, interesting.

1674
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:43,140
And Bobby says it's literally in the in-game menus.

1675
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:46,180
So it's like a actual feature in the game.

1676
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:52,260
Now that makes me wonder how far along was this game localized already?

1677
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:56,820
Cause you know, with those hacks and things that happened, I get it.

1678
01:28:56,820 --> 01:29:01,940
It's a shady, shady slippery slope, but we know that there are things that Nintendo started

1679
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:04,660
to localize that they pulled back on for whatever reason.

1680
01:29:04,660 --> 01:29:06,420
These things happen in the gaming industry all the time.

1681
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:13,460
And Nintendo themselves embraced it years ago with the Earthbound Zero release on Wii U.

1682
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:14,180
Remember that?

1683
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:15,540
That was also pretty cool.

1684
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:18,420
And I don't know why the fuck that's not on Switch still, but okay.

1685
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:24,020
Um, so Nintendo was not exactly a stranger to putting these things out.

1686
01:29:24,020 --> 01:29:26,500
So I'm, it's just interesting.

1687
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:27,300
That's all.

1688
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:29,060
So anyway.

1689
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:30,260
All right.

1690
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:32,900
Let's move on because this is also about the Switch, Dark Sakura.

1691
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:40,660
Well, um, some good news since, uh, you know, a lot of us have been dealing with Joy-Con

1692
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:47,940
Drift, which I still need to call to get mine taken care of, um, is that Nintendo is dropping

1693
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:55,700
the price of a single Joy-Con controller from, uh, where it was before for $49.99 and is

1694
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:57,460
now $39.99.

1695
01:29:57,460 --> 01:30:04,420
So it's only a $10 drop, but it is something, um, it's going to be available starting on

1696
01:30:04,420 --> 01:30:05,300
November 9th.

1697
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:12,740
Um, and they are also, um, specifically discounting two, uh, uh, specific models.

1698
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:16,900
So it's the right Joy-Con red and the left Joy-Con blue.

1699
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:23,220
Um, so it's the, you know, the same ones that were included in the, the default, uh, with

1700
01:30:23,220 --> 01:30:25,380
one of the original releases of the Switch.

1701
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:27,620
Um, and they are still offering free repairs.

1702
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:30,980
So I need to look into, you know, that as well.

1703
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:37,620
Um, there is a, not a price change for the full set of controllers.

1704
01:30:37,620 --> 01:30:42,740
However, it looks like Amazon might be having a sale for $69.99 instead of $79.99.

1705
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:44,500
So there is that.

1706
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:46,900
So there you go.

1707
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:48,580
It is what it is.

1708
01:30:48,580 --> 01:30:54,580
Um, as SSG100Matt in chat, uh, over at Twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, so the prices are

1709
01:30:54,580 --> 01:30:55,380
drifting down.

1710
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:58,340
That is not funny.

1711
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:01,940
You of the dad jokes.

1712
01:31:01,940 --> 01:31:04,580
No, sorry.

1713
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:06,900
Did Drew go out to visit SSG100Matt?

1714
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:08,020
Like what's happening here?

1715
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:08,340
All right.

1716
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:11,220
Okay.

1717
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:14,180
So anyway, all right.

1718
01:31:14,180 --> 01:31:18,740
So, uh, I'm here for prices coming down, especially on really expensive Nintendo hardware.

1719
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:19,700
Uh, so cool.

1720
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:20,900
All right.

1721
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:22,740
Let's move on to some PlayStation news.

1722
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:28,260
So let's talk about Travis Scott, um, who's been a lot of places lately.

1723
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:34,020
And so I'm surprised and I'm not surprised to see that he is teaming up now with PlayStation.

1724
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:37,460
So this is Travis Scott and his brand, which is Cactus Jack.

1725
01:31:37,460 --> 01:31:41,860
If you didn't know that already, uh, who's also already worked with things like Tesla,

1726
01:31:41,860 --> 01:31:43,380
Fortnite, McDonald's.

1727
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:48,260
Like I said, like he's, Travis Scott is not just a musician, but very much a businessman.

1728
01:31:48,260 --> 01:31:49,860
He's, he's in a lot of places.

1729
01:31:49,940 --> 01:31:51,380
So it was announced this week.

1730
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:58,260
Um, it went in a interesting PlayStation, uh, video, uh, that was, uh, owed to the Maxwell

1731
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:00,980
high fidelity tape and sound thing.

1732
01:32:00,980 --> 01:32:02,660
You, you know, this you've seen this before.

1733
01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:07,300
It's the guy sitting in the chair and then the TV turns on and whoosh, like the sound

1734
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:08,180
and all that, everybody.

1735
01:32:08,180 --> 01:32:09,620
It's like an infamous commercial.

1736
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:15,220
And this was kind of a homage to that commercial, but of course it was Travis Scott.

1737
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:21,700
And it also kind of puts together that, Oh, is this why Travis Scott posted a dual sense

1738
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:24,180
five controller on his Instagram last month?

1739
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:26,020
Like, how did you get that?

1740
01:32:27,780 --> 01:32:32,340
So, uh, and it's because he is going to be working with PlayStation.

1741
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:38,340
Now I'm not sure exactly how they don't really say like, he's, I guess like a creative mind.

1742
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:43,300
Um, but in a post on the PlayStation blog, which apparently he authored, um, it said,

1743
01:32:44,180 --> 01:32:48,260
I'm really looking forward to being able to showcase everything that cactus Jack has worked

1744
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:50,740
on with Sony and the PlayStation team.

1745
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:55,140
Most importantly, I'm excited to see how the PlayStation fans and family respond.

1746
01:32:55,140 --> 01:32:58,900
And I look forward to running some games with everybody very soon.

1747
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:05,140
So we don't exactly know what that entails, but like, I could see that, you know, we know

1748
01:33:05,140 --> 01:33:10,980
that a year after this PlayStation is out, there's going to be a re maybe not like a

1749
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:13,300
full redesign, but like a recoloring of it.

1750
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:13,780
Right.

1751
01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:15,860
Or a re like a pattern version of it.

1752
01:33:15,860 --> 01:33:15,940
Right.

1753
01:33:15,940 --> 01:33:19,700
Cause that's, that's what happens all the time with like, like Xbox, but now it's a gray

1754
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:22,740
Xbox or a see-through Xbox or a PlayStation.

1755
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:24,900
It's a, it's a blue PlayStation or any of this stuff.

1756
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:27,220
So I'm sure this is just a matter of time before something like that.

1757
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:32,180
And so maybe there'll be like a Travis Scott designed or a cactus Jack kind of PlayStation.

1758
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:37,460
Like, I don't know any thoughts from you guys on, on what this team up could involve for Travis.

1759
01:33:37,460 --> 01:33:40,980
Okay.

1760
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:41,460
Maybe not.

1761
01:33:42,260 --> 01:33:42,900
It's all right.

1762
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:43,700
Loki, you're muted.

1763
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:46,180
That's, that's why I'm like, pause, awkward pause.

1764
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:48,420
I don't know what he would be necessarily doing.

1765
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:50,580
It's just usually marketing stuff.

1766
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:57,540
I know he does a lot of merchandise online, but I don't know.

1767
01:33:57,540 --> 01:34:04,180
Hopefully it's better than that mortal combat re arcade one up cabinet that we had for Supreme.

1768
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:06,580
I don't think it'll be better than that.

1769
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:07,540
I don't think I'll do that.

1770
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:08,420
Jamie, you had a thought.

1771
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:11,860
I'm more with Loki on this one.

1772
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:15,380
I think it's just, I don't really think it's very big.

1773
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:20,340
Well, it's, you know, but he, it's interesting, you know, cause I know he's, he's most known

1774
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:25,780
as a musician, but again, the business side of things like that McDonald's deal is a lot

1775
01:34:25,780 --> 01:34:27,940
bigger than I think most people realize.

1776
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:31,940
And like, like, like, cause you know, he had his own meal, like he was actually on the

1777
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:34,660
menu, he'd get the Travis Scott meal and it was all in a commercial.

1778
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:35,780
He was narrating everything.

1779
01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:39,620
And the whole catch was, I think the burger was customized and the French fries came with

1780
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:43,540
barbecue sauce instead of ketchup, because that's how he does it.

1781
01:34:43,540 --> 01:34:49,860
And McDonald's were running out of barbecue sauce because of that.

1782
01:34:49,860 --> 01:34:54,500
So, I mean, his name and his endorsement obviously carries weight.

1783
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:59,860
Or I I've always said long before Travis Scott, that barbecue sauce is the way to go with

1784
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:01,620
fries, but that I digress.

1785
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:03,380
I disagree.

1786
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:05,220
That's fine.

1787
01:35:05,220 --> 01:35:07,140
Some people do ranch, some do ketchup, some do nothing.

1788
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:12,260
Because mayonnaise is delicious and ketchup is the devil.

1789
01:35:12,260 --> 01:35:14,740
Oh no, that's the Nickelback meal.

1790
01:35:14,740 --> 01:35:15,060
Bleh.

1791
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:16,980
I'm just kidding.

1792
01:35:16,980 --> 01:35:17,220
All right.

1793
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:24,660
Uh, yeah, I'm not a mayo person, but I know that's what they do in other countries.

1794
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:25,380
Yes, you're right.

1795
01:35:25,380 --> 01:35:29,060
Of course you go over to like Europe and other places mayo or mayo.

1796
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:30,020
No, bleh.

1797
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:30,420
What?

1798
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:32,660
Rob, do you like the In-N-Out sauce?

1799
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:35,060
No, it's mayonnaise based.

1800
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:36,260
Okay.

1801
01:35:38,020 --> 01:35:39,300
It was worth asking.

1802
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:40,660
No, I don't like it at all.

1803
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:43,300
No, and Thousand Island.

1804
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:43,940
No, no, no.

1805
01:35:43,940 --> 01:35:44,580
Aioli.

1806
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:45,460
No, no, no.

1807
01:35:45,460 --> 01:35:46,740
I know all the tricks.

1808
01:35:46,740 --> 01:35:47,620
No mayo allowed.

1809
01:35:47,620 --> 01:35:48,660
That's what Pixel Baka says.

1810
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:49,300
No, I can't.

1811
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:52,900
Despite my love of the other weird thing, that is my weird thing.

1812
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:54,900
I hate mayonnaise.

1813
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:55,380
Hate it.

1814
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:57,540
But you know what I also don't like?

1815
01:35:57,540 --> 01:35:59,220
Our McDonald's hamburgers.

1816
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:01,620
So I've never had a Travis Scott meal.

1817
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:03,140
You know what?

1818
01:36:03,140 --> 01:36:09,860
I think the last McDonald's hamburger I ever thought that I really liked was the Arch Deluxe.

1819
01:36:10,980 --> 01:36:11,940
Oh, okay.

1820
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:12,340
Okay.

1821
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:13,140
Remember the Arch Deluxe?

1822
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:13,620
Yeah, I do.

1823
01:36:13,620 --> 01:36:13,860
I do.

1824
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:19,140
Because my vegetables were not wilty pieces of shit by the time I got my burger.

1825
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:21,220
Bring it back.

1826
01:36:21,220 --> 01:36:23,860
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I love dipping fries in mayo.

1827
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:25,540
I also don't do that in front of Rob.

1828
01:36:25,540 --> 01:36:26,740
You have permission to dip.

1829
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:27,460
I don't care.

1830
01:36:27,460 --> 01:36:28,420
You can eat mayo.

1831
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:30,260
Just don't do that stupid thing.

1832
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:32,500
And I know you won't, Bobby, because this isn't your personality.

1833
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:34,340
But people in my past have done this.

1834
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:37,620
They dip it in the mayonnaise and go, oh, you want it?

1835
01:36:37,620 --> 01:36:38,500
You want it?

1836
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:38,900
Eat it.

1837
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:43,620
Well, if you do that to you, I just I'm like that, though, about ketchup.

1838
01:36:43,620 --> 01:36:43,860
Yeah.

1839
01:36:43,860 --> 01:36:48,580
If you have to dip their fries in anything, then they haven't made their fries well enough

1840
01:36:48,580 --> 01:36:51,540
because their fries should be just good enough as it is.

1841
01:36:51,540 --> 01:36:58,100
The problem is, see, so the way I used to describe fast food fries with a lot of the

1842
01:36:58,100 --> 01:37:03,780
stuff McDonald's, their their consistency, it varies a lot.

1843
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:07,540
It's just whether they could be really garbage or they can be really great.

1844
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:09,620
If they're fresh, they're great.

1845
01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:13,060
But there's other like not even necessarily fresh.

1846
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:15,380
They have to have them cook the right amount of time, seasoned right.

1847
01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:15,880
All that stuff.

1848
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:21,300
But like there's other fast food chains that their fries are more consistent, but they're

1849
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:25,140
never going to be as good as the best in and out fries.

1850
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:26,740
I'm sorry.

1851
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:30,740
Now that we have a Shake Shack here locally, nothing Shake Shack fries are great.

1852
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:32,500
Nothing can touch those fries.

1853
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:34,420
Done by Rob.

1854
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:37,220
Five guys has better fries.

1855
01:37:37,940 --> 01:37:39,940
I didn't it's the peanut oil.

1856
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:41,060
I didn't like the bag of grease.

1857
01:37:42,580 --> 01:37:43,220
All right.

1858
01:37:43,220 --> 01:37:47,540
However, however, I have found an ultimate fry replacement.

1859
01:37:47,540 --> 01:37:53,780
Even my delicious sweet potato fries have been bested by the habits.

1860
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:55,780
Tempo green beans.

1861
01:37:57,860 --> 01:37:59,060
Really good.

1862
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:01,140
Some of you on the East Coast will get a kick out of this.

1863
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:06,100
We just got a Shake Shack here locally, like right when the pandemic started, I think is

1864
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:07,860
when they finally opened, unfortunately.

1865
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:10,660
So, yeah, now that's here.

1866
01:38:10,660 --> 01:38:12,180
And yeah, their fries are bomb.

1867
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:16,420
And the closest thing to it is Del Taco fries is the only other place I've seen do the crinkly

1868
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:16,900
fries.

1869
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:22,420
But Del Taco fries, like as good as they are, they have a tendency to make them soggy, dry.

1870
01:38:23,060 --> 01:38:26,580
The one with my health makes them very dry and flavorless.

1871
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:31,780
And for the record, SSA 100 Matt, yes, if you're going to have in and out fries, you

1872
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:34,020
have to have them animal style because it's pretty amazing.

1873
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:34,520
Nope.

1874
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:39,940
You know, though, they're the fries that I loved as a kid, though, were from Checkers

1875
01:38:39,940 --> 01:38:41,620
or Rallies or whatever the fuck the companies.

1876
01:38:41,620 --> 01:38:42,180
Oh, yeah.

1877
01:38:42,180 --> 01:38:42,820
Oh, yeah.

1878
01:38:42,820 --> 01:38:46,020
With the with the kind of spicy little bits to it.

1879
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:48,660
And Whataburger does not have the best fries.

1880
01:38:48,660 --> 01:38:49,700
I'm sorry.

1881
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:51,460
Crystal's has crappy fries.

1882
01:38:51,460 --> 01:38:52,100
I'm sorry.

1883
01:38:52,820 --> 01:38:59,940
Um, because again, that's where I grew up, you know, just saying, um, I'm trying to think

1884
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:03,780
that we're had really good fries that Oh, you know, I miss Steak and Shake.

1885
01:39:04,660 --> 01:39:06,580
Oh, not yet.

1886
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:07,700
It's in Reno.

1887
01:39:07,700 --> 01:39:08,340
It's in Reno.

1888
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:09,460
It's getting close.

1889
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:12,740
Yeah, but we can't really compare curly fries because that's a whole different thing.

1890
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:14,260
I mean, that's kind of its own thing.

1891
01:39:14,260 --> 01:39:17,300
Okay, I just gonna say, though, it's interesting because in chat, they're talking about like,

1892
01:39:17,300 --> 01:39:17,940
wow, I didn't know.

1893
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:21,380
Shake Shack finally branched out there.

1894
01:39:21,620 --> 01:39:26,740
We're all of a sudden getting these things that like the rest of the nation has had.

1895
01:39:26,740 --> 01:39:32,500
Like, we just got our first Cracker Barrel, which I kind of think is overrated.

1896
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:34,020
But people are into it.

1897
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:34,260
Cool.

1898
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:34,500
Fine.

1899
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:37,220
But it's the only place I can get good fried catfish.

1900
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:37,720
Fair enough.

1901
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:41,220
Uh, that just happened within the past two years.

1902
01:39:41,220 --> 01:39:43,620
We just know we need Waffle House, Bobby.

1903
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:45,300
We need fucking Waffle House.

1904
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:47,380
California will never have a Waffle House.

1905
01:39:47,380 --> 01:39:48,180
That's already been.

1906
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:48,980
I know why.

1907
01:39:48,980 --> 01:39:50,740
Yeah, because the wage thing.

1908
01:39:50,740 --> 01:39:52,020
Our minimum wage is higher.

1909
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:52,900
Exactly.

1910
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:56,420
We have some decent knockoffs, though, because since we don't have Waffle House.

1911
01:39:56,420 --> 01:39:57,620
Can we get a White Castle?

1912
01:39:58,740 --> 01:40:02,900
No, we do not have a decent Waffle House.

1913
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:03,940
Knock off the end.

1914
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:05,140
We do not.

1915
01:40:05,780 --> 01:40:06,340
I don't know.

1916
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:08,260
I think there's an okay place.

1917
01:40:08,260 --> 01:40:09,540
No, we do not.

1918
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:15,380
As someone who has grown up and has eaten at Waffle House, I've eaten at the child.

1919
01:40:15,380 --> 01:40:18,500
No, no, you've eaten at Waffle House a couple of times.

1920
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:20,260
I have eaten at a Waffle House weekly.

1921
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:21,700
I'm allowed to have opinions.

1922
01:40:23,140 --> 01:40:25,060
I'm allowed to have opinions.

1923
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:27,300
You're allowed to have an opinion, but in this case, it's wrong.

1924
01:40:27,860 --> 01:40:31,540
Waffle House does not have a West Coast equivalent.

1925
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:33,220
End of story.

1926
01:40:33,220 --> 01:40:33,380
Yeah.

1927
01:40:33,380 --> 01:40:36,180
Carlos, your fries are good, but you need to have ketchup for those.

1928
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:40,420
But those are actually, so they read as in their fries and they're all right.

1929
01:40:40,420 --> 01:40:41,540
But they're not as ever.

1930
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:42,180
They're not going to ever be as good as me.

1931
01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:45,140
So our next story is about voting.

1932
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:47,620
Wait, one more fries, and then we can go to voting.

1933
01:40:47,620 --> 01:40:51,220
Sia Tabiri in chat says the worst are the new KFC fries.

1934
01:40:51,220 --> 01:40:52,820
I totally disagree.

1935
01:40:52,820 --> 01:40:54,980
I think those KFC fries are so freaking good.

1936
01:40:54,980 --> 01:40:59,940
I can't make my brain know what KFC fries are like, so I can't comment on that one.

1937
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:02,660
All right, but you can use your voice to vote.

1938
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:07,940
So I will say that I agree with Black Compat.

1939
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:10,820
Waffle House does have the best grits.

1940
01:41:10,820 --> 01:41:12,420
And my mother, bless her.

1941
01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:17,060
I was gonna say, you cannot get those here, even at the knockoff places.

1942
01:41:17,060 --> 01:41:26,340
So I will concede that Rob, you can get them at my house because you stole a bag or your

1943
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:27,620
mom got you a bag or something.

1944
01:41:27,620 --> 01:41:29,460
No, it's not because I stole them.

1945
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:34,740
If you ask behind the counter, they will sell you a bag of their quick rice grits for 99

1946
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:35,060
cents.

1947
01:41:35,060 --> 01:41:37,860
And my mother freaking sent me two bags of them.

1948
01:41:37,860 --> 01:41:39,060
And I love them.

1949
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:42,500
And I will have really good butter in them.

1950
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:46,100
Or I will, if I'm feeling extra trife, I'll make shrimp and grits.

1951
01:41:46,340 --> 01:41:50,020
Isn't it amazing that we get this passionate about French fries?

1952
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:51,620
But when it comes to, are y'all voting?

1953
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:58,020
Okay, so now that we've gotten everyone's passions all built up.

1954
01:41:58,820 --> 01:42:00,820
Use that voice.

1955
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:02,020
We gotta eat now.

1956
01:42:02,020 --> 01:42:04,740
And this is something I am ridiculously passionate about.

1957
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:08,020
I have been participating in SPN votes.

1958
01:42:08,020 --> 01:42:11,140
I've been working with vote.org.

1959
01:42:11,140 --> 01:42:15,220
I've been trying to spread the word on my social media as much as I can.

1960
01:42:16,100 --> 01:42:22,180
So I'm super happy to hear that more in the gaming industry is stepping up and offering

1961
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:24,420
up now a voting location.

1962
01:42:24,420 --> 01:42:30,660
You know, we've got states like what the fuck were they thinking Texas with, you know, only

1963
01:42:30,660 --> 01:42:34,260
allowing like one voting location per district or something like that.

1964
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:39,860
The lines I'm seeing on like from our listener is from our listeners.

1965
01:42:39,860 --> 01:42:41,940
And I'm seeing on their Twitters and things.

1966
01:42:41,940 --> 01:42:43,140
It blows my mind.

1967
01:42:44,100 --> 01:42:44,900
Do you have this?

1968
01:42:45,620 --> 01:42:45,860
Sorry.

1969
01:42:45,860 --> 01:42:47,140
I just say sorry listeners.

1970
01:42:47,140 --> 01:42:51,620
You know that we just got mailed ballots, filled them out and dropped them off at the

1971
01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:55,620
library at the grocery store where the or mail them in any type of.

1972
01:42:55,620 --> 01:42:59,060
Now there was that whole scandal about the official drop box versus the not official

1973
01:42:59,060 --> 01:42:59,300
ones.

1974
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:00,180
We won't go there.

1975
01:43:00,180 --> 01:43:02,820
But it is completely unrepentant.

1976
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:07,780
If you look in the with your ballot, it tells you where you can drop them off.

1977
01:43:07,780 --> 01:43:10,660
So I was like, okay, the library nearby.

1978
01:43:10,660 --> 01:43:12,740
Okay, that's where I'm going to go because that is an official one.

1979
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:15,060
So that's what I did online.

1980
01:43:15,060 --> 01:43:16,420
And my mind's already been accepted.

1981
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:20,180
So anyway, so the lines are blowing my mind anyway.

1982
01:43:20,180 --> 01:43:20,580
Go ahead.

1983
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:21,140
Yeah, they are.

1984
01:43:21,140 --> 01:43:25,620
And by the way, I actually do have to give some kudos to a couple of rather famous people

1985
01:43:25,620 --> 01:43:31,220
that I follow on social media who stood in line on purpose in solidarity.

1986
01:43:31,220 --> 01:43:31,460
Good.

1987
01:43:31,460 --> 01:43:41,780
So but anyway, 100 Thieves has turned their home office in Los Angeles into a voting center.

1988
01:43:43,540 --> 01:43:49,860
They, they basically were saying that their 100 Thieves cash app compound, which is a

1989
01:43:49,860 --> 01:43:55,700
15,000 square foot building, opened earlier in the year is now serving as an LA County

1990
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:56,980
voting center.

1991
01:43:56,980 --> 01:44:03,460
And it's open for early voters starting on October 30, through November 2, and on election

1992
01:44:03,460 --> 01:44:04,660
date November 3.

1993
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:11,140
And they also partnered with a graffiti artist goes by slick to have a mural on the on the

1994
01:44:11,140 --> 01:44:12,660
building that says vote.

1995
01:44:13,460 --> 01:44:19,220
It's kind of in Mickey Mouse hands, you know, but then it's going to change to we voted

1996
01:44:19,220 --> 01:44:25,380
on November 2, they are going to follow all this safety guidelines, voters will have to

1997
01:44:25,380 --> 01:44:34,260
be masked and gloved and social distancing for those in the area is 6050 Jefferson Boulevard,

1998
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:35,060
Los Angeles.

1999
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:40,580
And so I really think that it's great, you know, they, they're known for their professional

2000
01:44:40,580 --> 01:44:42,660
teams for League of Legends, Fortnite, Valorant.

2001
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:50,100
You know, I think that this is really good that they are using their, their location

2002
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:55,620
and their voices to encourage others to vote because we do have a lot of damage that needs

2003
01:44:55,620 --> 01:44:56,900
to be corrected.

2004
01:44:56,900 --> 01:44:59,300
And it's awesome that they're doing that.

2005
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:00,420
It is awesome that they're doing it.

2006
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:01,460
I don't want to lessen it.

2007
01:45:01,460 --> 01:45:07,940
My gut reaction, though, is like, dang, it's too bad that they're not in New York or Georgia

2008
01:45:07,940 --> 01:45:12,580
or one of these places that I'm seeing the crazy lines because California, again, we

2009
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:16,740
all it's every county now, it does what this county has been doing for years with the mail

2010
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:17,460
in thing.

2011
01:45:17,460 --> 01:45:21,380
And so technically, I mean, technically, they don't really need it.

2012
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:22,820
But it's nice to have options.

2013
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:25,060
And anything that'll get more people to vote is a good thing.

2014
01:45:25,060 --> 01:45:26,340
I don't want to lessen that.

2015
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:31,300
But that was I was like, dang, too bad it wasn't in Georgia or, you know, New York,

2016
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:37,140
or why I think it's good they are doing this because they are setting a example.

2017
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:38,260
OK, I'll give you that.

2018
01:45:38,260 --> 01:45:39,300
Yeah, yeah.

2019
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:46,820
If they can do this, why can't other places there's you know, we have companies all over,

2020
01:45:46,820 --> 01:45:52,100
you know, the nation, not necessarily, you know, centralized in California.

2021
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:55,940
And on top of that, you know, there are other major tech businesses that could stand to

2022
01:45:55,940 --> 01:45:56,980
do the same thing.

2023
01:45:56,980 --> 01:46:00,180
You know, you know, call center campuses.

2024
01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:03,860
I think that they should be allowed to set up for the same thing for some of our major

2025
01:46:03,860 --> 01:46:04,360
companies.

2026
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:09,800
I we were blessed, we were very fortunate that we could do a mail in drop off.

2027
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:10,300
Yeah.

2028
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:17,160
But a lot of and I'm just going to go out and say it a lot of red states are are actively

2029
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:21,560
working on their voter suppression because they know that that it can switch.

2030
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:24,360
They could at least, you know, hang out in the purple region for a little while.

2031
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:31,640
But they know that the tide is changing, that people's opinions are changing and have really

2032
01:46:31,640 --> 01:46:32,760
restricted voters.

2033
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:39,960
So I think that we need more companies stepping up and adding this kind of of availability

2034
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:40,460
for people.

2035
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:45,480
Now, Bobby Black Wolf does want to correct because he's I kept kept bringing up Georgia

2036
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:46,840
because I was seeing videos from there.

2037
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:50,040
But Bobby does say, Hi, Georgia resident lines are better now.

2038
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:53,640
The reason you saw the long lines on day one was because it was Columbus or Indigenous

2039
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:54,520
People's Day.

2040
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:56,200
So people had the day off.

2041
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:58,360
The lines are about 30 to 45 minutes now.

2042
01:46:58,360 --> 01:47:02,040
See what's interesting, though, like, I got to be honest, I got to be completely honest.

2043
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:06,040
Even when I hear 30 to 45 minutes, I'm like, oh, that stinks.

2044
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:11,160
Like, I just filled mine out at home while I was watching Twitch and then just ran it

2045
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:11,800
by the library.

2046
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:12,200
That's it.

2047
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:13,240
That's all I did.

2048
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:16,200
So I, you know, I'm not trying to be like, yay me, boo you.

2049
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:20,760
But I got to admit, like, I'm like, why can't every state just do it this way?

2050
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:21,800
More people would vote.

2051
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:24,760
But yeah, Jamie is right on.

2052
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:30,360
It's unfortunately some people are afraid that if it goes that way, then the elections

2053
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:31,240
will turn out differently.

2054
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:33,160
And that's that's unfortunate.

2055
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:39,880
Well, and I think the big thing with Texas, too, is that there was and now I with the

2056
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:47,320
caveat, do not rely on the polls for your decision because we saw it happen in 2016.

2057
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:49,800
But they are seeing that.

2058
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:55,240
Well, and Hot Pockrey, by the way, Austin is like mini California.

2059
01:47:55,240 --> 01:48:00,600
I'm just saying, you know, Austin is this little blue pocket in the middle of a sea

2060
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:01,080
of red.

2061
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:06,440
And so, you know, which honestly, if there was anywhere in the south that I would move

2062
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:08,680
back to, it would be Austin in a heartbeat.

2063
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:09,560
I would live in Austin.

2064
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:12,680
I would never move back to Mobile.

2065
01:48:12,680 --> 01:48:13,160
I'm just saying.

2066
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:19,720
But back to what I was saying, you know, is that they know that the state is already starting

2067
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:21,800
to shift to blue overall.

2068
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:23,240
And they're afraid.

2069
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:29,960
They're afraid that the you know, that their way it's like that with any kind of way of

2070
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:37,560
life, we even see it in, you know, in evolution, you know, that the whatever the newer species

2071
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:41,080
is, the newer way of thought is always going to be attacked on by the older.

2072
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:44,760
And so, you know, this is more important than ever.

2073
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:50,040
I'm glad that we're seeing more turnout than ever before.

2074
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:52,760
Texas's turnout was pretty insane already.

2075
01:48:52,760 --> 01:49:00,200
I've been watching the numbers on on some of the the polls I've been watching for the state

2076
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:01,800
just because I have friends that live there.

2077
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:03,480
And so I think it's amazing.

2078
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:07,320
But yeah, we need more companies doing this and we need them to be allowed to do this.

2079
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:10,280
Why our vote is even more important.

2080
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:14,520
And I got to say, and one message, you know, as despite I'm sitting here going, I just

2081
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:16,600
was able to drop off my ballot at the library.

2082
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:21,480
I really salute those of you out there that are waiting in line.

2083
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:25,640
And please, that's why I was been harping on last week's show and the week before and

2084
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:27,800
before that make a voting plan.

2085
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:30,920
That's why I say that, because, you know, when I say plant, you might have to plan to

2086
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:34,680
wait two and a half hours to vote somewhere, whatever it is, even longer, depending on

2087
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:35,480
where you're at.

2088
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:39,800
So I just I really salute those of you that are getting in line to do it.

2089
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:44,600
And I just I'm tipping my hat to you like, Jamie, do you know of any like since I am

2090
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:49,640
in California and I'm spoiled with the mail in thing, can I like buy those people coffee

2091
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:50,200
somehow?

2092
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:54,040
Like, is there an organization that like, yeah, is that legal?

2093
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:59,320
I don't know if it's legal, but I would think that if there's no harm and like, can I somehow

2094
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:00,360
cheer those people on?

2095
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:04,120
Yeah, there are companies that are doing it anyway.

2096
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:13,960
However, it's illegal to do food giveaways in some places, but there are there's like

2097
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:14,280
snack.

2098
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:15,480
What's it called?

2099
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:18,360
I think snack the vote pizza to the polls.

2100
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:26,520
OK, there there's there there are places like that, but also look for some of the suggestions

2101
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:27,160
coming from.

2102
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:31,880
And it's a group that I'm involved with very recently is random acts dot org.

2103
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:33,800
It's our random acts of kindness.

2104
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:43,960
And they've they they're a nonprofit that's dedicated to doing kindness in the world,

2105
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:45,800
just making the world a better place.

2106
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:51,960
And I know people on there have been working on gathering together, working with some of

2107
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:57,320
the food banks, working with, you know, some of the covid support.

2108
01:50:57,320 --> 01:51:01,800
And I think that there's some people with random acts who might have been trying to

2109
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:03,560
band together to do some things in their name.

2110
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:11,080
But on top of that, anyway, I just say, you know, if you see people in line, you know,

2111
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:17,080
bring bring bring out a bunch of, you know, protein bars, bring water with you.

2112
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:19,800
You know, if someone says, hey, you can't do that, go away.

2113
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:24,280
Well, you've even if you've given out five bottles of water to somebody, you've done

2114
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:27,560
a kindness and you've helped encourage them.

2115
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:28,060
Yeah.

2116
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:29,560
All right.

2117
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:31,880
Anyway, let's let's move on.

2118
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:32,840
But please vote.

2119
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:35,240
That's the message.

2120
01:51:35,880 --> 01:51:36,680
All right.

2121
01:51:36,680 --> 01:51:38,280
Let's talk about this next story.

2122
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:39,560
And I think, Loki, we're back to you.

2123
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:42,200
All right.

2124
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:43,320
Oh, yeah.

2125
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:43,800
Yeah, we are.

2126
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:44,840
Sorry, I'm backwards.

2127
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:46,440
OK, cool.

2128
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:51,720
Anyways, let's talk a little bit about more streaming stuff.

2129
01:51:51,720 --> 01:51:57,640
So, you know, we talked a little bit about how Google Stadia has had support for some

2130
01:51:57,640 --> 01:52:03,000
of their streaming six, but not all of them, unfortunately.

2131
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:07,240
But what's kind of fun is seeing what may be coming for Xbox games pass.

2132
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:13,240
So, for example, one of the things that's being teased is that there may be a bundle

2133
01:52:13,240 --> 01:52:22,360
with a TV streaming stick to be able to stream game pass via like a basically like an HDMI

2134
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:27,240
device that you would plug into your TV, you know, similar to Amazon Fire or Chromecast

2135
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:31,160
using X cloud.

2136
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:33,320
So it's interesting.

2137
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:37,240
That might be something that's coming as far as the Xbox ecosystem.

2138
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:42,360
But, you know, what they're talking about is kind of similar to, you know, like Stadia

2139
01:52:42,360 --> 01:52:47,080
where, you know, you'd have a controller, you know, the games pass subscription and

2140
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:48,920
the stick itself.

2141
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:52,840
So I'd be interested in seeing that.

2142
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:56,280
I think that'd be really cool, especially if it seems to be that they're focusing a

2143
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:57,640
lot on X cloud.

2144
01:52:57,640 --> 01:53:01,560
And that would be a big way to get people into that ecosystem.

2145
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:02,840
Yeah, for sure.

2146
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:08,520
So and it's also interesting because it competes a little more directly with Google

2147
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:10,520
Stadia, perhaps on that level.

2148
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:11,740
Yeah.

2149
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:15,960
So, yeah, Phil Spencer basically say, I think you're going to see lower price hardware

2150
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:20,360
as part of our ecosystem when you think about streaming sticks and other things that somebody

2151
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:23,800
might want to just go and plug into their TV and go play X cloud.

2152
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:28,280
So, yeah, that'd be pretty cool to see something like that in the future.

2153
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:29,240
They'd be able to do that.

2154
01:53:29,240 --> 01:53:34,600
And I would imagine that's probably, you know, very feasible considering Android devices

2155
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:35,640
are able to support this.

2156
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:40,840
So if they can put a stick together that can handle something like that, I think it's

2157
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:43,800
feasible within the next probably year or so we'll see that.

2158
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:44,300
Yeah.

2159
01:53:44,840 --> 01:53:45,340
All right.

2160
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:50,120
And then, oh, yeah, I was going to say one last thing, though, of course, to go along

2161
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:56,920
with that, I was going to say the iPhone streaming stuff as well.

2162
01:53:57,560 --> 01:54:04,680
There's, of course, you may remember this whole thing with the App Store and wanting

2163
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:12,120
like separate, like practically separate programs for each one of the games that you would stream.

2164
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:19,640
So now they've, I think, worked out a way to actually use basically, yeah, so using

2165
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:22,840
the App Store, you can stream as well.

2166
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:27,160
I want to say through, it's kind of a convoluted way through the Xbox app.

2167
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:30,840
So you sign in with that with your Microsoft account and you click on the library and do

2168
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:32,520
all that stuff instead of a console.

2169
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:37,960
It's interesting to see they're going to have like a workaround for that to be able

2170
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:44,680
to use it on the iPhone, but still not probably the best way to do that.

2171
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:48,220
Yeah.

2172
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:52,360
And I think I heard one of them got taken offline as well.

2173
01:54:52,440 --> 01:54:55,480
Like there was some type of like backdoor app or something, and they ended up taking

2174
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:56,200
that offline.

2175
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:59,880
So just wait, wait for, wait for all those companies to work it out.

2176
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:04,120
If nothing else, it sounds like, you know, if they're not able to get an official app

2177
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:08,760
or something, it sounds like Microsoft may go the way that Luna's going and do like an

2178
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:10,120
integrated web app type of thing.

2179
01:55:10,120 --> 01:55:11,960
Just they got to get the technology working first.

2180
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:16,360
So it's only a matter of time before, you know, it comes to iPhone one way or another.

2181
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:17,400
Yeah.

2182
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:23,720
So with the workarounds right now in place, you know, you can try that, but I think if

2183
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:27,560
they're going to, yeah, go through like the web browser or something like that, then that

2184
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:29,480
would be probably the best way to do it.

2185
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:33,960
Unless they can get, you know, Apple to agree to allow them to put it on the store in its

2186
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:34,600
current state.

2187
01:55:35,640 --> 01:55:36,440
All right.

2188
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:41,720
Well, let's move on and talk a little bit about a game that we never shut up about,

2189
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:43,880
even though it never came out.

2190
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:47,960
It was just a demo of a game that came out, God, years and years ago.

2191
01:55:47,960 --> 01:55:52,440
What was it like five years ago, at least five years ago at this point, more than that.

2192
01:55:53,240 --> 01:55:58,120
It's a little game called P.T., which of course was the playable teaser for what would

2193
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:04,360
eventually or supposed to be a Silent Hills game that of course didn't end up happening

2194
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:07,640
due to Hideo Kojima leaving Konami and so on and so on.

2195
01:56:08,680 --> 01:56:13,480
So with all the games that, and I think this came up last week, we were talking about that

2196
01:56:13,480 --> 01:56:18,920
there's only 10 games that are not going to be backwards compatible on PlayStation 5,

2197
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:19,880
according to Sony.

2198
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:25,880
So this leaves people asking, oh, does this mean P.T. is backwards compatible?

2199
01:56:26,440 --> 01:56:35,400
So a news outlet out there, GamesRadar, contacted Konami and actually asked, can we play P.T.

2200
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:37,080
on the PlayStation 5?

2201
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:42,440
And the answer they got was, P.T. will not be available on the PlayStation store, so

2202
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:46,360
users won't be able to redownload the content through the backwards compatibility feature

2203
01:56:46,360 --> 01:56:47,640
to the PlayStation 5.

2204
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:57,160
Which isn't really the answer they were looking for, because, well, OK, so I can't download

2205
01:56:57,160 --> 01:56:58,200
it anymore.

2206
01:56:58,200 --> 01:57:03,800
But technically, if I put it on a drive and then I can move that drive over to the PlayStation

2207
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:05,960
5, I should be able to play it.

2208
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:07,640
You're never going to be able to play.

2209
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:13,240
Well, I don't know if it's so much and here's what I think is going on here.

2210
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:16,120
I don't know if it's so much as they don't want you to play it.

2211
01:57:16,120 --> 01:57:19,400
I mean, yes, Konami would probably like to forget that that is out there.

2212
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:23,720
But the reality is the answer they gave is not wrong.

2213
01:57:24,600 --> 01:57:31,480
They don't want to endorse the methods that people are using to still play P.T.

2214
01:57:31,480 --> 01:57:36,200
They don't want to endorse that, oh, you can download it somewhere else and use a loophole

2215
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:38,760
to get it on your drive and get it to work that way.

2216
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:44,280
That's the problem and why Konami has to stick to this line that, no, P.T. is not playable

2217
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:46,840
on the PlayStation 5 because there's no way to download it.

2218
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:50,600
In their mind and in their league, that is the answer.

2219
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:55,800
So I also don't necessarily think like I know people want to jump all over Konami, like

2220
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:57,240
stop blowing smoke up our ass.

2221
01:57:57,240 --> 01:57:59,400
Tell us what the reality is.

2222
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:03,000
They're not going to, because if they were to say, oh, yeah, it works fine on PlayStation

2223
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:08,760
5, bam, they just endorse these techniques people are using to play P.T. when the game

2224
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:10,680
was delisted five years ago.

2225
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:18,680
So I think looking at the list that there's 10 games, I think we could all safely bet

2226
01:58:18,680 --> 01:58:21,160
it's probably going to work, but.

2227
01:58:22,440 --> 01:58:23,720
Will it work right?

2228
01:58:23,720 --> 01:58:30,920
It may not, because even the PlayStation Pro, I thought, brought some nuances to that that

2229
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:32,280
was kind of dicey.

2230
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:33,240
I don't remember.

2231
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:37,400
Of course, I have PlayStation Pro and was able to copy P.T. over because you can copy

2232
01:58:37,400 --> 01:58:38,440
kind of like everything over.

2233
01:58:38,440 --> 01:58:40,920
But I don't know.

2234
01:58:40,920 --> 01:58:41,960
I can't remember.

2235
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:45,480
And I have to ask the expert if Flaco Jones was here, because he knows that game in and

2236
01:58:45,480 --> 01:58:46,840
out a lot better than I do.

2237
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:54,760
But I could see that there could be some problems with PlayStation 5 and the emulation that

2238
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:56,280
it may not work correctly.

2239
01:58:56,280 --> 01:58:59,240
Not all the tricks you're used to using may actually work.

2240
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:00,360
So we'll see.

2241
01:59:02,680 --> 01:59:04,200
Um, it's dark soccer back by chance.

2242
01:59:05,400 --> 01:59:06,520
She stepped away for a minute.

2243
01:59:06,520 --> 01:59:09,080
OK, she's not back, so I can't get to the next segment.

2244
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:10,280
So we need to buy some.

2245
01:59:10,280 --> 01:59:11,240
Oh, OK.

2246
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,520
No, I was eating cake.

2247
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:16,840
Oh, I was eating cake.

2248
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:18,120
Sorry, I was doing my story.

2249
01:59:18,120 --> 01:59:19,080
OK, back to you.

2250
01:59:19,080 --> 01:59:19,320
All right.

2251
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:20,200
Sorry, sorry.

2252
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:20,700
All right.

2253
01:59:21,400 --> 01:59:23,240
Well, I hope the so the cake was not a lie.

2254
01:59:24,360 --> 01:59:26,040
No, it was an apple streusel cake.

2255
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:28,600
OK, because I was like an apple coffee cake.

2256
01:59:28,600 --> 01:59:29,320
It was pretty good.

2257
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:32,040
The question in chat everybody's going to want to know is what kind of cake?

2258
01:59:32,840 --> 01:59:36,120
OK, it was it was an apple coffee cake.

2259
01:59:36,120 --> 01:59:37,320
It was delightful.

2260
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:45,480
And it made me remember that I've only had a half a protein shake and a sausage and some

2261
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:47,720
peanut butter pretzels today.

2262
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:48,200
All right.

2263
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:51,880
Well, I'm sorry to tear you away, but it is that time to finish it.

2264
01:59:51,880 --> 01:59:52,440
OK, good.

2265
01:59:52,440 --> 01:59:55,560
Look, I don't see anything.

2266
01:59:56,360 --> 01:59:57,720
My Ikea bowl.

2267
01:59:57,720 --> 01:59:58,220
All right.

2268
01:59:58,840 --> 02:00:00,520
Let's get to the classic game of the week.

2269
02:00:01,160 --> 02:00:05,000
Every week, our soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds the game that she thinks,

2270
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:08,040
hey, you brat should be checking this game out.

2271
02:00:08,040 --> 02:00:13,160
But actually, in a twist for twenty twenty once a month, she picks a pinball game.

2272
02:00:13,160 --> 02:00:15,640
And it's actually been a little while since we had a pinball game, because I think we

2273
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:18,200
did one like early September and now we're in late October.

2274
02:00:18,200 --> 02:00:19,000
So it's been a little bit.

2275
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:22,520
But Dark Soccer has picked a pinball game for us tonight.

2276
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:27,320
So I think Dark Soccer, you want me to announce this by playing this actual commercial for

2277
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:28,440
the table, right?

2278
02:00:28,440 --> 02:00:29,720
Just the first part of it, yes.

2279
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:30,600
OK, let's do that.

2280
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:32,280
And Jamie, you're not going to be able to hear it.

2281
02:00:32,280 --> 02:00:33,400
So I'll tell you when it's over.

2282
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:39,560
OK, so here we go to introduce us to the classic pinball table of the month.

2283
02:00:54,280 --> 02:00:55,320
Hello, darlings.

2284
02:00:55,400 --> 02:01:00,200
Yes, it's me, the titillating temptress in the flesh and not much else.

2285
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:02,200
Elvira, mistress of the dark.

2286
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:07,320
And tonight I have an especially terrifying tale from those monster hit makers of Bally.

2287
02:01:07,320 --> 02:01:10,360
It stars my favorite actress of all time, me.

2288
02:01:11,080 --> 02:01:14,760
And it's destined to become a true cult classic forever,

2289
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:17,320
or at least until you croak, whichever comes first.

2290
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:20,600
But I can see you're ready for some action.

2291
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:22,680
So get ready to get scared.

2292
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:26,280
All right, Jamie, you can go.

2293
02:01:27,080 --> 02:01:28,120
There it is, Elvira.

2294
02:01:28,120 --> 02:01:28,760
I love her.

2295
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:30,040
I love her.

2296
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:31,880
She is what I love about Halloween anyway.

2297
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:33,020
Yeah.

2298
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:39,800
So, yes, the classic pinball of the month is scared stiff, which I mean, how could I

2299
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:40,300
not?

2300
02:01:41,160 --> 02:01:41,800
It's perfect.

2301
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:42,440
It's perfect.

2302
02:01:42,440 --> 02:01:44,120
And it's Elvira.

2303
02:01:44,120 --> 02:01:45,640
Look, here's the funny thing.

2304
02:01:45,640 --> 02:01:47,640
Elvira invented dad jokes.

2305
02:01:49,240 --> 02:01:50,120
I know, I know.

2306
02:01:50,120 --> 02:01:52,120
Just I know it doesn't make sense when I say it.

2307
02:01:52,360 --> 02:01:54,840
But really, like puns are her strength.

2308
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:59,640
And think about that scared stiff and Elvira.

2309
02:01:59,640 --> 02:02:01,720
It's I love it.

2310
02:02:01,720 --> 02:02:02,440
Anyway, go ahead.

2311
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:09,240
And by the way, I do have a little, little teensy correction.

2312
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:12,760
The new pinball is not scared stiff.

2313
02:02:12,760 --> 02:02:15,320
It is Elvira's house of horrors, just saying.

2314
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:18,360
So it is not scared stiff.

2315
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:25,720
Um, anyway, scared stiff, uh, came out in 1996, uh, was designed by Dennis Nordman and

2316
02:02:25,720 --> 02:02:27,800
released by Midway as Bally.

2317
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:34,680
And, um, of course it stars Elvira and it is the follow up to 1989 Elvira and the party

2318
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:36,680
monsters that was also designed by Nordman.

2319
02:02:37,320 --> 02:02:41,800
Um, it uses Midway's, uh, WPC 95 system.

2320
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:44,840
Um, and it has this B movie horror theme.

2321
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:46,280
Cause I mean, it's freaking Elvira.

2322
02:02:46,840 --> 02:02:52,600
You have to go through the six tales of terror to level up this different meter and you have

2323
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:58,120
eyes of the Bonnie beast terror from the crate stiff in the coffin, the monster's lab night

2324
02:02:58,120 --> 02:03:00,200
of the leapers and return to the dead heads.

2325
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:05,400
Um, and of course it does have this like interactive back box is really cool.

2326
02:03:05,400 --> 02:03:13,080
It had this, uh, spider in, um, you know, in different, uh, different, uh, neat modes.

2327
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:18,200
And of course, uh, when they, uh, exhibited the game, they had Cassandra Peterson there

2328
02:03:18,200 --> 02:03:19,640
as Elvira to help with the promotion.

2329
02:03:20,360 --> 02:03:24,440
Um, and it was supposed to have some other things in there.

2330
02:03:24,440 --> 02:03:29,400
It was supposed to have a rubber boogeyman figure that would, uh, be mounted over slingshots.

2331
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:32,840
They're supposed to move forward with the kicker when the ball was hit.

2332
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:38,200
Um, and the ROM actually still allows for them to dance to the music during boogeyman

2333
02:03:38,200 --> 02:03:38,840
boogie mode.

2334
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:44,440
Um, but it was removed because their arms were going to break off.

2335
02:03:45,160 --> 02:03:48,520
Um, so, uh, but the code is still there.

2336
02:03:48,520 --> 02:03:51,000
And so people have still done the mods on it.

2337
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:57,400
Um, scared stuff is also licensed for pinball arcade until, uh, June 30th, 2018.

2338
02:03:58,200 --> 02:04:00,360
So a little bit more about that.

2339
02:04:00,360 --> 02:04:05,400
Of course, you know, we had, uh, her doing voice acting for, for the, uh, for the game.

2340
02:04:06,040 --> 02:04:12,200
There are so many things going on with this table that it's, uh, it's pretty good.

2341
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:14,040
It's, it's got a lot going on.

2342
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:21,240
Um, and so, uh, there's also this skull pile in the upper right-hand corner of the play field.

2343
02:04:21,240 --> 02:04:26,680
Um, that was supposed to have lighter buys, but the production versions did not do that.

2344
02:04:26,680 --> 02:04:30,840
And so people have also added in, uh, after factory LEDs.

2345
02:04:31,320 --> 02:04:34,840
Um, so there is a website out there though.

2346
02:04:34,840 --> 02:04:39,720
That is like, and it, it looks like one of those old web pages that was designed in like

2347
02:04:40,760 --> 02:04:48,920
19, you know, 95 using AOLs, you know, designer tools, like very, very rudimentary HTML,

2348
02:04:48,920 --> 02:04:54,440
geo cities, but, uh, maybe, but it's this guy's like domain and everything.

2349
02:04:54,440 --> 02:04:59,960
So, um, but, uh, he's got some very cool stuff on here, like some different treasures and

2350
02:04:59,960 --> 02:05:02,840
behind the scenes stuff for, uh, scared stuff.

2351
02:05:02,840 --> 02:05:07,640
It's just, uh, robertwinter.com slash pinball slash SS.

2352
02:05:08,280 --> 02:05:12,360
And I mean, just got, I mean, yeah, it's not a pretty site, but it's got some really neat

2353
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:16,760
things to look at, like the back glass and the differences between the different machines.

2354
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:21,560
And I don't normally bring up, you know, another website to talk about a game that,

2355
02:05:21,560 --> 02:05:25,480
that I'm discussing, but in this case, while it's not the best site,

2356
02:05:25,480 --> 02:05:27,560
it's got some really neat stuff on it.

2357
02:05:27,560 --> 02:05:32,200
So I totally suggest people look at it and it's got the rulesheets up and, you know,

2358
02:05:32,200 --> 02:05:35,720
we had, you know, we had a scared stiff in my house for a while, but due to COVID,

2359
02:05:35,720 --> 02:05:37,320
no one could come over and play it with us.

2360
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:39,320
So there you go.

2361
02:05:40,040 --> 02:05:40,840
It's scared stiff.

2362
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:43,960
All right.

2363
02:05:44,680 --> 02:05:47,240
I didn't realize there were three Elvira games now.

2364
02:05:48,280 --> 02:05:51,240
Yeah, the, the current one is a stern pinball.

2365
02:05:51,320 --> 02:05:58,600
And, um, if you watch Netflix channel, um, he's done, uh, some play on it already.

2366
02:05:58,600 --> 02:05:59,080
I think.

2367
02:05:59,080 --> 02:06:01,720
Um, so, uh, what's his name?

2368
02:06:01,720 --> 02:06:02,280
Jack danger.

2369
02:06:02,840 --> 02:06:08,200
Um, really, it looks really solid, but I mean, I've, I've hardly played any of the stern ones

2370
02:06:08,200 --> 02:06:12,200
that I haven't enjoyed as a table, even if I haven't enjoyed the theming.

2371
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:14,200
Um, so yeah, scared.

2372
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:18,920
I mean, if I was going to do a modern pinball, I don't, I would actually have done Munsters.

2373
02:06:19,880 --> 02:06:25,160
Um, like that Munsters, uh, black and white le, um, that has like a mini play field in

2374
02:06:25,160 --> 02:06:25,560
the middle.

2375
02:06:25,560 --> 02:06:27,400
That is really, really cool.

2376
02:06:28,040 --> 02:06:31,960
Um, but, uh, but I mean, we're going classics.

2377
02:06:31,960 --> 02:06:33,080
This is a classic game.

2378
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:34,840
And pinball is a classic.

2379
02:06:34,840 --> 02:06:42,920
You know, 1996, I was playing this at a bar, um, at, gosh, it wasn't, it wasn't Solomon's

2380
02:06:42,920 --> 02:06:43,560
that got it in.

2381
02:06:43,560 --> 02:06:46,600
It was another place that had gotten to pinball in.

2382
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:48,840
And I played this probably not too long after it came out.

2383
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:50,360
Nice.

2384
02:06:50,360 --> 02:06:51,640
And yes, Bobby, I agree.

2385
02:06:51,640 --> 02:06:54,840
The Hot Wheels, uh, table is actually pretty decent.

2386
02:06:54,840 --> 02:06:57,400
Um, I have seen it in play on a live stream.

2387
02:06:57,400 --> 02:06:58,360
I haven't been able to play it.

2388
02:06:59,400 --> 02:07:03,480
I will say about this table, and you can actually see this as the, the person is playing here

2389
02:07:03,480 --> 02:07:07,240
on, on Twitch and you probably can hear it too in the audio, especially earlier in the

2390
02:07:07,240 --> 02:07:10,680
sequence, but jackpots are really easy to get in this game.

2391
02:07:10,680 --> 02:07:14,040
Like, because every mode that you activate has some way to get like a jackpot.

2392
02:07:14,040 --> 02:07:17,880
And so as you, if you're decent enough at this game, you can just get jackpot, jackpot,

2393
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:19,560
jackpot, jackpot, like over and over.

2394
02:07:19,560 --> 02:07:20,920
It's pretty, pretty interesting.

2395
02:07:21,480 --> 02:07:26,920
So yeah, but the thing is that the skill is to get your multipliers with it, but I do

2396
02:07:26,920 --> 02:07:27,560
love this table.

2397
02:07:29,160 --> 02:07:31,480
I do love this table because I love Elvira.

2398
02:07:31,480 --> 02:07:35,880
So yeah, honestly, I think this one's more fun than a party monsters.

2399
02:07:35,880 --> 02:07:38,200
So yeah, your mileage may vary.

2400
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:38,600
All right.

2401
02:07:38,600 --> 02:07:39,160
There it is.

2402
02:07:39,160 --> 02:07:40,760
Your classic pinball of the month.

2403
02:07:40,760 --> 02:07:42,920
Elvira scared stiff.

2404
02:07:42,920 --> 02:07:47,720
All right, let's get into some rapid fire news and talk quickly about some other things.

2405
02:07:47,720 --> 02:07:50,840
Happening around the industry or actually, Jimmy, are you staying with us or did you

2406
02:07:50,840 --> 02:07:51,880
need to go part way?

2407
02:07:51,880 --> 02:07:52,440
I can't remember.

2408
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:57,560
You know, I actually, um, my, my headache has come back with a vengeance.

2409
02:07:57,560 --> 02:08:04,280
Um, so, and, and just to let everybody know, you know, I, I really wanted to stay and finish

2410
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:09,880
the show tonight, but, um, I either I have neck pain caused by migraine or migraine caused

2411
02:08:09,880 --> 02:08:10,600
by neck pain.

2412
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:12,200
So either way, I'm fucked.

2413
02:08:12,920 --> 02:08:13,640
Oh dear.

2414
02:08:13,640 --> 02:08:14,440
We'll feel better.

2415
02:08:14,440 --> 02:08:15,080
It's okay.

2416
02:08:15,080 --> 02:08:15,960
Thank you so much.

2417
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:19,080
And you know, guys, I, I love all of you.

2418
02:08:19,080 --> 02:08:23,400
You're all amazing people and, um, a little, little teeny plug if I may.

2419
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:23,640
Yeah.

2420
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:29,560
Um, don't forget that on Thursday I am going to be a guest on am I mental?

2421
02:08:29,560 --> 02:08:36,920
If you go to am I mental.net, um, I will be talking with, uh, E who was on the show last

2422
02:08:36,920 --> 02:08:42,040
weekend, um, about mental health and, you know, I'm, I'm probably going to be pretty

2423
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:42,680
brutal on here.

2424
02:08:42,680 --> 02:08:45,880
So you're going to see a side of me that I don't often, uh, talk about.

2425
02:08:46,440 --> 02:08:51,000
Uh, I might talk a little bit about on the show, but I, uh, I don't go off into too much

2426
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:55,000
detail about, so we're going to get dirty, whatever you're comfortable with.

2427
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,600
So enjoy the show.

2428
02:08:56,600 --> 02:08:57,720
He was a great guest.

2429
02:08:57,720 --> 02:08:59,000
That was a good talk last week.

2430
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:04,440
So he's a, he's a great person, a good friend, and I'm really happy we could have him and

2431
02:09:04,440 --> 02:09:06,360
I'm happy that I get to be on a show.

2432
02:09:06,360 --> 02:09:07,080
All right.

2433
02:09:07,080 --> 02:09:07,320
All right.

2434
02:09:07,320 --> 02:09:08,600
Well, we'll talk to you next week.

2435
02:09:08,600 --> 02:09:09,080
Feel better.

2436
02:09:09,800 --> 02:09:10,200
All right.

2437
02:09:10,200 --> 02:09:10,680
Love y'all.

2438
02:09:10,680 --> 02:09:11,080
Bye.

2439
02:09:11,080 --> 02:09:11,320
Bye.

2440
02:09:11,880 --> 02:09:12,280
All right.

2441
02:09:12,280 --> 02:09:14,760
So meanwhile, just, uh, nevermind the visuals here.

2442
02:09:14,760 --> 02:09:18,280
I got to get sorted around, uh, but perhaps we will get into some rapid fire news and

2443
02:09:18,280 --> 02:09:22,120
I will have Loki start us off with rapid fire news here while I fix the visuals.

2444
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:23,240
Yeah.

2445
02:09:23,240 --> 02:09:28,520
So a game I was talking about a lot, uh, earlier this year was what the golf, and of course

2446
02:09:28,520 --> 02:09:31,000
it being an Epic games exclusive at the time.

2447
02:09:31,560 --> 02:09:36,280
Um, you could only purchase it there, but of course, after a certain amount of time,

2448
02:09:36,280 --> 02:09:42,120
it does eventually appear on other storefronts and this time now appearing on steam.

2449
02:09:42,120 --> 02:09:46,200
And with an added bonus that they've added a level editor for it.

2450
02:09:46,200 --> 02:09:51,560
So it's a great time to go purchase it now on steam and you can go check it out, uh,

2451
02:09:51,560 --> 02:09:53,160
with the level editor.

2452
02:09:53,800 --> 02:09:58,120
Um, and it's also on sale, so, um, definitely go check that out as well.

2453
02:09:58,760 --> 02:10:03,480
Um, I'm not sure if the level editor is going to be coming to other platforms, but at the

2454
02:10:03,480 --> 02:10:04,680
very least it's on steam.

2455
02:10:04,680 --> 02:10:07,240
So I may have to purchase it again.

2456
02:10:07,240 --> 02:10:07,640
We'll see.

2457
02:10:08,520 --> 02:10:15,400
And then, um, as we had talked about a while ago that you play is going to be phased out

2458
02:10:15,400 --> 02:10:20,920
in place of, um, uh, let's see Ubisoft connect.

2459
02:10:20,920 --> 02:10:26,920
So they've got, um, one of the things with you play that actually kind of dug a little

2460
02:10:26,920 --> 02:10:28,680
bit is playing certain games.

2461
02:10:28,680 --> 02:10:32,840
Like, you know, like for example, I used to play South park a lot, um, would earn you

2462
02:10:33,480 --> 02:10:36,440
points that you could then use to unlock.

2463
02:10:37,560 --> 02:10:42,760
Not necessarily DLC, but like usually cosmetics in like things for different games.

2464
02:10:42,760 --> 02:10:43,880
I saw it in just dance.

2465
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:47,240
You could get some remixes that way and little things, little costumes and things.

2466
02:10:47,240 --> 02:10:47,480
Yeah.

2467
02:10:47,480 --> 02:10:47,800
Yeah.

2468
02:10:47,800 --> 02:10:53,000
So I used to do that for like different classes and stuff in, um, the South park games and

2469
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:53,960
stuff like that.

2470
02:10:53,960 --> 02:10:59,720
So, uh, with that though, because that service is going to going away, they've decided to

2471
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:02,040
unlock all of the rewards.

2472
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:06,680
So you can go check them out before it's finally phased out on October 29th.

2473
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:08,680
So you have the rest of this week to do that.

2474
02:11:08,680 --> 02:11:11,400
So go download all those extras.

2475
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:14,840
If you can time to get out all your old Ubisoft games.

2476
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:15,400
Exactly.

2477
02:11:15,400 --> 02:11:19,720
I think I've gotten most of my stuff already, you know, cause the points are pretty easy

2478
02:11:19,720 --> 02:11:20,200
to get.

2479
02:11:20,840 --> 02:11:26,280
Um, so, but I still have to revisit some of the Ubisoft games that I have to go download

2480
02:11:26,280 --> 02:11:27,800
all that like bonus things for that.

2481
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:30,680
So, um, just a reminder to go check that out.

2482
02:11:30,680 --> 02:11:33,640
Um, so yeah, so that's pretty exciting.

2483
02:11:33,640 --> 02:11:38,120
It was one of those things that, um, kind of made you play feel, feel a little better

2484
02:11:38,120 --> 02:11:42,520
than some of the other third party, uh, signup things is that they kind of had that whole

2485
02:11:42,520 --> 02:11:47,400
like achievements make you, you actually get tangible things from achievements and that

2486
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:47,960
was kind of neat.

2487
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:49,240
Yeah.

2488
02:11:49,240 --> 02:11:51,640
It was nice to have that little bonus in there.

2489
02:11:51,640 --> 02:11:53,640
Um, so I do appreciate that.

2490
02:11:53,640 --> 02:11:59,240
It wasn't such a bother on like console when I was playing most of, you know, these games,

2491
02:11:59,240 --> 02:12:04,440
but I know with a PC having the extra launcher kind of sucks, but you know, whatever.

2492
02:12:05,080 --> 02:12:05,320
Yeah.

2493
02:12:05,960 --> 02:12:06,680
All right.

2494
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:09,160
Well, moving on, let's talk about a new studio.

2495
02:12:09,160 --> 02:12:12,440
Um, that's up and coming frost giant studios.

2496
02:12:12,440 --> 02:12:16,600
And, uh, you probably wouldn't be surprised that when I tell you frost giant studios is

2497
02:12:16,600 --> 02:12:19,880
formed by a lot of blizzard enter to get it frost giant blizzard.

2498
02:12:19,880 --> 02:12:24,600
I it's hilarious, but, uh, the actual little mascot, it's not so obvious at first cause

2499
02:12:24,600 --> 02:12:28,200
a little mascot for frost giant is an actual little like frost giant.

2500
02:12:28,200 --> 02:12:31,960
Um, but anyway, it's a former blizzard folks and look, I, I get it.

2501
02:12:31,960 --> 02:12:34,840
Uh, you know, blizzard is in an awkward place.

2502
02:12:34,840 --> 02:12:38,040
Uh, they're not quite the cool company they used to be.

2503
02:12:38,040 --> 02:12:42,440
Obviously we had all those, you know, issues with the, the banning of the starcraft player

2504
02:12:42,440 --> 02:12:44,200
that was supporting free Hong Kong.

2505
02:12:44,200 --> 02:12:49,160
Um, last year, uh, that was really awkward and their response was really awkward and

2506
02:12:49,160 --> 02:12:52,360
like a lot of awkward things have been happening with blizzard lately.

2507
02:12:53,320 --> 02:12:58,840
But I suppose the good news is that, you know, blizzard will still continue to put out their

2508
02:12:58,840 --> 02:13:06,040
products and you now have this frost giant studios who has raised $4.7 million to make

2509
02:13:06,040 --> 02:13:10,360
their first game, which will be a real time strategy game, which.

2510
02:13:11,080 --> 02:13:15,000
Where did blizzard get, get their roots with Warcraft star?

2511
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:15,800
And I don't mean world.

2512
02:13:15,800 --> 02:13:21,320
I mean, Warcraft, uh, two and three and then star craft, you know, it was really that RTS

2513
02:13:21,320 --> 02:13:22,040
genre.

2514
02:13:22,040 --> 02:13:27,720
Um, so, which is interesting because I'm not usually into those kinds of games, but I liked

2515
02:13:27,720 --> 02:13:32,200
old Warcraft a lot and I liked, no, I don't, I didn't really play original starcraft.

2516
02:13:32,200 --> 02:13:36,120
I guess I just played Warcraft two and original Diablo, which isn't really an RTS.

2517
02:13:36,120 --> 02:13:38,280
Um, but I'll try this.

2518
02:13:38,280 --> 02:13:39,240
Uh, it'll be interesting.

2519
02:13:40,040 --> 02:13:45,240
Anyway, Tim Morton and Tim Campbell from Starcraft and Warcraft, uh, said recently in an interview

2520
02:13:45,240 --> 02:13:50,280
that the RTS genre hasn't gotten as much attention lately, uh, like battle royale shooters or

2521
02:13:50,280 --> 02:13:55,080
console action games, but they think the RTS on the PC can still be a big, big part of

2522
02:13:55,080 --> 02:13:55,880
gaming in the future.

2523
02:13:55,880 --> 02:13:56,680
So good luck to them.

2524
02:13:56,680 --> 02:13:58,840
I'm going to look forward to see what they have coming.

2525
02:13:58,840 --> 02:14:00,440
Uh, cause that sounds pretty cool.

2526
02:14:00,440 --> 02:14:01,160
All right.

2527
02:14:01,160 --> 02:14:06,840
Uh, let's talk about Pokemon go, which has added AR mapping to their tasks.

2528
02:14:06,840 --> 02:14:11,640
I talked to similar to, uh, well, yeah, it's the same damn thing.

2529
02:14:11,640 --> 02:14:13,960
Um, but just the implementation is different.

2530
02:14:13,960 --> 02:14:17,880
So you might remember it was about three months ago on this show, but I was talking about

2531
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:25,400
the cemetery creeping, which I did pull back on a lot between the heat and the smoke from

2532
02:14:25,400 --> 02:14:26,440
all the fires.

2533
02:14:26,440 --> 02:14:29,080
I wasn't really able to go out on the weekends as much.

2534
02:14:29,080 --> 02:14:33,320
Um, and I just, since I got back, you know, from being gone a couple of weeks ago, I just

2535
02:14:33,320 --> 02:14:36,120
haven't gotten out this weekend or last weekend, but I want to go out and do that more.

2536
02:14:36,120 --> 02:14:37,240
Cause that's kind of fun.

2537
02:14:37,240 --> 02:14:40,360
Um, so you might remember, I talked about that on the show, like where I was scanning

2538
02:14:40,360 --> 02:14:40,840
portals.

2539
02:14:40,840 --> 02:14:41,560
Well, guess what?

2540
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:44,680
That is now just in Pokemon go.

2541
02:14:44,680 --> 02:14:49,480
Um, but it's been in there for like a month, but there was no reason to scan.

2542
02:14:49,480 --> 02:14:51,720
There was no motivation or anything.

2543
02:14:51,720 --> 02:14:55,720
So Pokemon go Niantic, they actually added some incentives.

2544
02:14:55,720 --> 02:14:58,920
So there's some tasks that you can get called AR mapping.

2545
02:14:58,920 --> 02:15:03,400
Uh, and then if you do the actual little scan of the portal, you might get a cool little

2546
02:15:03,400 --> 02:15:06,040
reward, like 10 Pokeballs or whatever it is.

2547
02:15:06,040 --> 02:15:09,560
Of course, when I was reading Reddit, some people are already kind of fucking with this.

2548
02:15:09,560 --> 02:15:13,560
Like when they get a task, they'll just scan the ground or something, um, which is like

2549
02:15:13,560 --> 02:15:18,920
not what you're supposed to do, but I guess if Niantic doesn't quality check, then I guess

2550
02:15:18,920 --> 02:15:19,960
people are going to do that.

2551
02:15:19,960 --> 02:15:25,240
Although I will say now, I don't know if this is in Pokemon go yet, but I will say in Ingress

2552
02:15:25,240 --> 02:15:30,120
in the last patch for Ingress, probably about two, three weeks ago, they actually made it

2553
02:15:30,120 --> 02:15:33,560
so that the scan will detect motion.

2554
02:15:33,560 --> 02:15:39,160
And if you don't move, you can't, you, you won't be able to finish the scan and you have

2555
02:15:39,160 --> 02:15:41,080
to have well lit conditions.

2556
02:15:41,080 --> 02:15:46,200
So if it's too dark or dark, so dark, you can't see the portal, which happened to me

2557
02:15:46,200 --> 02:15:46,760
the other night.

2558
02:15:46,760 --> 02:15:49,560
I was at a park and sundown is just happening earlier and earlier.

2559
02:15:49,560 --> 02:15:50,920
So we're getting later in the year.

2560
02:15:50,920 --> 02:15:55,480
Um, so I could not actually scan anymore at the park because the game said it's too dark

2561
02:15:55,480 --> 02:15:56,200
out.

2562
02:15:56,200 --> 02:16:01,400
Um, so I don't know if those fail safes are in Pokemon go cause I haven't been scanning.

2563
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:01,720
Okay.

2564
02:16:01,720 --> 02:16:03,800
S.J. and Hunter Matt says it is in Pogo.

2565
02:16:03,800 --> 02:16:05,960
It won't accept the scan unless you move around.

2566
02:16:05,960 --> 02:16:06,280
Thank you.

2567
02:16:06,280 --> 02:16:09,800
Cause I haven't been doing it cause I'm already doing it in Ingress.

2568
02:16:09,800 --> 02:16:13,880
I just wish my Ingress credits would come over to Pokemon go.

2569
02:16:13,880 --> 02:16:19,560
But what's interesting is that you can see some stops and gyms have the tasks, but not

2570
02:16:19,560 --> 02:16:20,360
all of them do.

2571
02:16:21,400 --> 02:16:25,960
And I like, for instance, one right by my house doesn't have the task.

2572
02:16:25,960 --> 02:16:27,880
Well, I'll tell you why it doesn't have the task.

2573
02:16:28,440 --> 02:16:31,080
I scanned that fucking thing lots of times.

2574
02:16:31,080 --> 02:16:32,040
It doesn't need anymore.

2575
02:16:33,240 --> 02:16:38,120
And, and not just me, but people that wanted to knock me off his scout controller, um,

2576
02:16:38,120 --> 02:16:41,320
and other people on my team as well, who just were nearby.

2577
02:16:41,320 --> 02:16:44,120
And cause sometimes we get together and exchange gear and stuff.

2578
02:16:44,120 --> 02:16:46,840
And so they wanted to scan it as well.

2579
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:51,640
Uh, that is probably why it doesn't show up as a place that you can do scanning in, um,

2580
02:16:52,760 --> 02:16:53,480
Pokemon go.

2581
02:16:53,480 --> 02:16:54,680
I just thought that was interesting.

2582
02:16:54,680 --> 02:16:59,080
So if some something by your house doesn't have a task available, somebody from Ingress

2583
02:16:59,080 --> 02:17:02,840
probably already scanned it a ton already, but I'll tell you hardly anyone's doing it

2584
02:17:02,840 --> 02:17:03,720
in Ingress either.

2585
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:05,720
Cause the rewards in Ingress are minimal.

2586
02:17:06,440 --> 02:17:07,400
It's like a badge.

2587
02:17:07,400 --> 02:17:09,000
You don't even get gear or nothing.

2588
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,600
So it's a little silly.

2589
02:17:10,600 --> 02:17:11,100
All right.

2590
02:17:11,880 --> 02:17:14,680
A hot pocketry in chat says, bring a flashlight.

2591
02:17:14,680 --> 02:17:16,920
I tried to use the one on my phone, but it wouldn't work.

2592
02:17:17,480 --> 02:17:19,000
I didn't think to bring a separate one.

2593
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:19,880
I didn't think I'd need it.

2594
02:17:20,600 --> 02:17:21,560
So, all right.

2595
02:17:21,560 --> 02:17:22,680
Uh, let's move on.

2596
02:17:22,680 --> 02:17:24,200
Uh, Jamie had some stories too.

2597
02:17:24,200 --> 02:17:26,280
Are you able to do these Loki or you want me to do them?

2598
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:26,680
I don't care.

2599
02:17:27,480 --> 02:17:29,480
Um, yeah, I can, I can talk about them.

2600
02:17:29,480 --> 02:17:29,980
Okay.

2601
02:17:30,040 --> 02:17:31,800
Um, so apparently.

2602
02:17:32,920 --> 02:17:33,640
Let's see.

2603
02:17:33,720 --> 02:17:41,880
There's a new, I mean, as with all times of the year, Humble has some new, um, a Halloween

2604
02:17:41,880 --> 02:17:43,880
sale kind of going on there.

2605
02:17:43,880 --> 02:17:46,600
So of course, discounting lots of different Halloween games.

2606
02:17:46,600 --> 02:17:51,720
I'm pretty sure that there's a lot of different store friends that are doing similar things.

2607
02:17:51,720 --> 02:17:53,640
I know Epic had something marked down.

2608
02:17:53,640 --> 02:17:58,680
I'm sure PlayStation Store did kind of everybody's discounting all the Halloween themed stuff.

2609
02:17:58,680 --> 02:18:05,080
So of course, Resident Evil 7, uh, Batman Arkham Knight, uh, game of Arkham City, all

2610
02:18:05,080 --> 02:18:08,280
that stuff's like, you know, 75% off, 80% off.

2611
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:10,440
So, uh, just go check all your storefronts.

2612
02:18:11,080 --> 02:18:12,040
It's probably a good idea.

2613
02:18:13,560 --> 02:18:23,160
And then, um, to go along with that, of course, also there was, uh, Zen Pinball had some,

2614
02:18:24,120 --> 02:18:27,320
uh, new titles that are being announced.

2615
02:18:27,320 --> 02:18:30,360
I guess from Alpha Numeric Pinball.

2616
02:18:31,080 --> 02:18:40,200
So they've got, let's see, Williams Pinball 6, and the tables include Fun House, Space

2617
02:18:40,200 --> 02:18:43,320
Station, Dr. Dudes, and his excellent Ray.

2618
02:18:44,120 --> 02:18:46,120
I am not familiar with any of these.

2619
02:18:46,120 --> 02:18:48,280
I apparently don't play enough pinball.

2620
02:18:48,280 --> 02:18:50,120
Fun House would be the most well known.

2621
02:18:50,120 --> 02:18:53,640
Fun House had a very scary looking face on the table.

2622
02:18:53,640 --> 02:18:53,960
Okay.

2623
02:18:53,960 --> 02:18:55,080
I do remember Fun House.

2624
02:18:55,880 --> 02:19:02,840
I'm not sure about, but, um, so yeah, so that's pretty cool.

2625
02:19:02,840 --> 02:19:09,400
Um, you can check those out for, uh, Pinball FX 3 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo

2626
02:19:09,400 --> 02:19:15,240
Switch, Windows 10, and Steam, as well as on the Williams Pinball app, iOS, and Google

2627
02:19:15,240 --> 02:19:15,560
Play.

2628
02:19:16,520 --> 02:19:17,000
All right.

2629
02:19:17,560 --> 02:19:21,080
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games that are

2630
02:19:21,080 --> 02:19:23,960
coming out near you real soon.

2631
02:19:24,040 --> 02:19:28,520
As we start to ramp up to the release of new systems, if you can believe it, we're what

2632
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:30,280
we're three weeks away from new systems.

2633
02:19:30,840 --> 02:19:31,800
Two weeks.

2634
02:19:31,800 --> 02:19:32,120
Wow.

2635
02:19:33,160 --> 02:19:34,120
Not even three.

2636
02:19:34,120 --> 02:19:37,320
Yeah, no, it's three because next week is Halloween.

2637
02:19:37,320 --> 02:19:41,880
Then we get the November 7th, it's three weeks, but it's close.

2638
02:19:42,920 --> 02:19:43,160
Yeah.

2639
02:19:43,720 --> 02:19:47,320
So, uh, starting off with this week, we've got Cobra Kai.

2640
02:19:47,320 --> 02:19:53,320

Shin Megami Tensei 3 Nocturne HD Remaster on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

2646
02:20:20,440 --> 02:20:26,920
And we've got Watchdog Legion on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Stadia.

2647
02:20:28,040 --> 02:20:32,920
Angry Video Game Nerd 1 and 2 Deluxe on PC and Nintendo Switch.

2648
02:20:33,960 --> 02:20:39,240

2649
02:20:40,280 --> 02:20:44,520

2650
02:20:44,520 --> 02:20:47,160
Pikmin 3 Deluxe on Nintendo Switch.

02:20:47,880 --> 02:20:51,480
The Mahari Kawasi Fresh on PlayStation 4.

2652
02:20:52,360 --> 02:20:57,080
Visage on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

2653
02:20:57,080 --> 02:20:57,560
That's it.

2654
02:20:58,120 --> 02:21:01,960
Just a random question from chat, um, over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

2655
02:21:01,960 --> 02:21:05,320
Pod Culture asks, how many system launches is OLR covered?

2656
02:21:05,320 --> 02:21:09,800
Um, so I mean, launches, we weren't on the air.

2657
02:21:09,800 --> 02:21:12,040
So our first show was in 2002.

2658
02:21:12,760 --> 02:21:16,520
And even though we were pretty exclusively about music games in those early years, like,

2659
02:21:16,600 --> 02:21:18,280
you know, it came up all the time.

2660
02:21:18,280 --> 02:21:19,640
We would still get tangents.

2661
02:21:19,640 --> 02:21:22,440
You know, Dark Soccer loved her classics and her Dreamcast and stuff.

2662
02:21:22,440 --> 02:21:25,880
So we would take tangents all the time outside the music and stuff.

2663
02:21:25,880 --> 02:21:32,280
So I would say we were covering the PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast and we were covering that era.

2664
02:21:32,280 --> 02:21:35,720
But it was kind of like, we didn't cover the launch, obviously,

2665
02:21:35,720 --> 02:21:38,840
because Dreamcast came out in 99, PS2 was what, 2001.

2666
02:21:38,840 --> 02:21:40,920
So we weren't quite on the air yet.

2667
02:21:40,920 --> 02:21:45,800
I remember one of the big things was I just got my Japanese PlayStation 2 before OLR started.

2668
02:21:45,800 --> 02:21:47,320
So that was like a thing.

2669
02:21:47,320 --> 02:21:51,400
Um, so when it comes to launches, then we did like PlayStation 3.

2670
02:21:51,400 --> 02:21:54,200
And I think Xbox 360 was just before that.

2671
02:21:54,200 --> 02:21:54,920
And then PS3.

2672
02:21:54,920 --> 02:21:57,240
And I think Wii came out around the same time.

2673
02:21:57,240 --> 02:22:01,080
So we covered all that because that was the big lines where we were handing out donuts and stuff.

2674
02:22:01,080 --> 02:22:04,360
Uh, and then of course we did the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2675
02:22:04,360 --> 02:22:06,440
And then now the PlayStation 5 and so forth.

2676
02:22:06,440 --> 02:22:11,080
So, um, as Bobby said in chat, this will be the fourth generation of the, of the big three.

2677
02:22:11,080 --> 02:22:11,720
And that's about right.

2678
02:22:11,720 --> 02:22:19,160
3DS and Nintendo DS and Vita and PSP.

2679
02:22:19,160 --> 02:22:22,120
And I think, uh, and Amico next year.

2680
02:22:22,120 --> 02:22:31,160
Um, let's see the, um, let's see, uh, what was I going to say to, um, Xbox?

2681
02:22:31,160 --> 02:22:35,320
The original Xbox had also already been out, uh, when the show started.

2682
02:22:35,320 --> 02:22:40,360
I, I bought my Xbox, I think a couple months into doing the show.

2683
02:22:40,360 --> 02:22:43,960
Cause I finally bought one for Halo and, uh, to play DDR.

2684
02:22:44,600 --> 02:22:45,960
So, uh, yeah.

2685
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:46,120
Yeah.

2686
02:22:46,120 --> 02:22:47,800
All three consoles are out by 2002.

2687
02:22:47,800 --> 02:22:52,200
So it's, it's been a lot, but it's also interesting to think considering that we've been doing

2688
02:22:52,200 --> 02:22:54,280
this Loki for 18 and a half years.

2689
02:22:55,720 --> 02:22:59,080
Um, it is interesting to think it's actually not that many.

2690
02:22:59,720 --> 02:23:03,560
When you think just how long we've been doing this show, it's not that many launches all

2691
02:23:03,560 --> 02:23:04,440
things considered.

2692
02:23:04,440 --> 02:23:08,200
This is the first one that should have been, this was supposed to be a 10 year generation.

2693
02:23:08,200 --> 02:23:09,560
Well, this is the first one.

2694
02:23:09,560 --> 02:23:11,000
This is the first one in a pandemic.

2695
02:23:12,040 --> 02:23:13,720
So it'll be interesting.

2696
02:23:13,720 --> 02:23:13,960
All right.

2697
02:23:13,960 --> 02:23:14,680
Anyway, sorry.

2698
02:23:14,680 --> 02:23:17,240
Uh, tangent question, but I thought it was a good one.

2699
02:23:17,240 --> 02:23:21,000
Uh, going to, uh, Japan and checking out the releases there.

2700
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:27,080
We have coming out on the 29th, Mad Rat Dead, Shantae and the Seven Sirens on Nintendo Switch.

2701
02:23:27,080 --> 02:23:29,240
Uh, Shimagami Tensei 3 Nocturne.

2702
02:23:29,240 --> 02:23:30,920
It's an HD remaster of that.

2703
02:23:30,920 --> 02:23:31,640
Cool.

2704
02:23:31,640 --> 02:23:36,360
Uh, and then Common Rider Memory of Heroes, uh, is coming out as well in Japan.

2705
02:23:36,360 --> 02:23:37,560
That's on the Switch.

2706
02:23:37,560 --> 02:23:42,920
And also Taishu Cross Alice Heads and Tails is coming out as well.

2707
02:23:43,480 --> 02:23:47,560
Uh, going over to the PlayStation 4, I imagine we're going to see some overlap.

2708
02:23:47,560 --> 02:23:48,360
Uh, yeah.

2709
02:23:48,360 --> 02:23:52,120
Watch Dogs Legion actually is also out, uh, this coming week in Japan.

2710
02:23:52,120 --> 02:23:53,080
So that's pretty cool.

2711
02:23:53,080 --> 02:23:54,840
As is the Mad Rat Dead.

2712
02:23:54,840 --> 02:23:57,480
Uh, there is a Kemco RPG selection.

2713
02:23:57,480 --> 02:24:03,400
It's volume five of some various RPGs from over the years by Kemco put together in that,

2714
02:24:03,400 --> 02:24:08,520
including As Divine Menace, Wizards of Brandel, Sea Carts and Innocent Revengers.

2715
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:10,280
Those are all the games that are going to be in it.

2716
02:24:10,280 --> 02:24:13,400
Uh, and then Shimagami Tensei remaster is out on PS4.

2717
02:24:13,400 --> 02:24:17,240
Uh, Saints Row the Third remastered gets its Japanese release.

2718
02:24:17,240 --> 02:24:19,320
So they must've done some things to localize it for Japan.

2719
02:24:19,320 --> 02:24:20,520
Cause that came out here a while ago.

2720
02:24:21,080 --> 02:24:24,120
Uh, it was on the Switch probably I'm guessing, right?

2721
02:24:24,120 --> 02:24:25,320
This one's on the PlayStation 4.

2722
02:24:25,880 --> 02:24:27,160
Oh, PlayStation 4.

2723
02:24:27,160 --> 02:24:27,720
Yeah.

2724
02:24:27,720 --> 02:24:28,760
That's been a while.

2725
02:24:28,760 --> 02:24:30,440
Yeah, but they, they might've localized it.

2726
02:24:30,440 --> 02:24:30,920
I don't know.

2727
02:24:30,920 --> 02:24:32,920
That's why sometimes why it's a little delayed in Japan.

2728
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:37,080
Some of the releases that are a little more, uh, made for this audience, they take a while

2729
02:24:37,080 --> 02:24:38,120
to localize.

2730
02:24:38,120 --> 02:24:43,960
Uh, Common Rider Memory of Heroes also released on PlayStation 4 this week and, uh, a price

2731
02:24:43,960 --> 02:24:48,680
reduction and game of the year edition for Sekiro Shadows Die Twice.

2732
02:24:49,320 --> 02:24:50,520
How about the UK, Loki?

2733
02:24:51,880 --> 02:24:57,720
Um, in the UK we've got Cobra Kai, the Karate Kid Saga continues on PlayStation 4 and Xbox

2734
02:24:57,720 --> 02:25:03,480
One looks like Company of Heroes 2 All Out War Edition on PC.

2735
02:25:04,600 --> 02:25:09,400
Who Wants to be a Millionaire on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.

2736
02:25:09,960 --> 02:25:14,120
Watchdog Legion on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2737
02:25:14,760 --> 02:25:17,400
Mortal Shell on Xbox One.

2738
02:25:18,360 --> 02:25:24,440
We've got the Dark Pictures Anthology Volume One on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2739
02:25:25,320 --> 02:25:27,640
Pikmin 3 Deluxe on Nintendo Switch.

2740
02:25:28,920 --> 02:25:31,160
Ninja Legends on PlayStation 4.

2741
02:25:31,800 --> 02:25:38,040
The Dark Pictures Anthology Little Hope on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2742
02:25:38,920 --> 02:25:45,560
And last but not least, Dead Cells Prisoners Edition on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.

2743
02:25:47,400 --> 02:25:48,040
All right.

2744
02:25:48,040 --> 02:25:51,560
So lots, you know, we're getting into November when all the games are going to come out.

2745
02:25:51,560 --> 02:25:53,640
So, uh, busy, busy, busy.

2746
02:25:53,640 --> 02:25:54,120
All right.

2747
02:25:54,440 --> 02:25:57,960
We are going to now, uh, get back into some other news.

2748
02:25:57,960 --> 02:26:00,280
Um, I can't believe it's already 8 30.

2749
02:26:00,280 --> 02:26:03,400
So we may cover this news a little quickly because we want to get some of your questions.

2750
02:26:03,400 --> 02:26:04,680
There's no emails tonight though.

2751
02:26:04,680 --> 02:26:07,240
So we, we only have time for questions at the end.

2752
02:26:07,240 --> 02:26:09,320
Hopefully we'll get some, but we have a few stories first.

2753
02:26:09,320 --> 02:26:09,820
Loki.

2754
02:26:10,680 --> 02:26:11,000
Yeah.

2755
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:18,680
So, um, Mojang announced that they're going to be migrating everybody over to Microsoft

2756
02:26:18,680 --> 02:26:23,640
accounts, including folks that are, well, I should say only the Java edition players

2757
02:26:23,720 --> 02:26:28,520
of Minecraft because everybody already is on Minecraft or, um, Microsoft accounts.

2758
02:26:28,520 --> 02:26:32,040
If you're playing Minecraft on consoles or the windows 10 edition.

2759
02:26:32,680 --> 02:26:36,760
Um, so they are going to be migrating folks over to Microsoft accounts.

2760
02:26:36,760 --> 02:26:40,360
You're going to have to create one for the Java edition soon.

2761
02:26:40,360 --> 02:26:45,960
Um, which will allow you to have the two factor authentication and, you know, improve parental

2762
02:26:45,960 --> 02:26:48,120
controls and all that wonderful stuff.

2763
02:26:48,120 --> 02:26:52,920
Nothing else really changed about the game aside from how you log into it, instead of

2764
02:26:52,920 --> 02:26:56,360
having to have a separate Mojang account or Minecraft.net account.

2765
02:26:56,920 --> 02:27:02,440
Uh, you'll be able to log in using that to incentivize people to do so.

2766
02:27:02,440 --> 02:27:06,280
Um, you will actually get a free Cape.

2767
02:27:06,280 --> 02:27:09,880
So they're going to offer you a free Cape that you can use for your character as well.

2768
02:27:10,440 --> 02:27:14,360
Um, and starting this fall, you'll have to create those Microsoft accounts.

2769
02:27:14,360 --> 02:27:20,520
So they haven't really specified a specific date yet, but it'll be pretty easy to do that.

2770
02:27:20,680 --> 02:27:24,920
I kind of liked that cause I don't use the Java version too often.

2771
02:27:24,920 --> 02:27:30,120
So I tend to forget my Mojang, um, login credentials.

2772
02:27:30,760 --> 02:27:34,440
So, um, it'll be nice to just have it all under one.

2773
02:27:35,080 --> 02:27:39,320
But some people are trying to equate this to the Facebook Oculus thing and I'm like,

2774
02:27:40,840 --> 02:27:42,600
no, not necessarily.

2775
02:27:42,600 --> 02:27:44,360
It doesn't seem nearly as bad.

2776
02:27:45,080 --> 02:27:50,280
No, they're the, I mean, you have to have a Microsoft account already for like the other

2777
02:27:50,360 --> 02:27:53,160
versions of, um, Minecraft.

2778
02:27:53,160 --> 02:27:57,240
And it's not necessarily like, this isn't tied to like social media or anything.

2779
02:27:57,240 --> 02:27:59,320
They're not requesting your real name.

2780
02:27:59,320 --> 02:28:00,520
They don't really care.

2781
02:28:00,520 --> 02:28:05,240
It's just, it's just basically a centralized, um, login service.

2782
02:28:05,240 --> 02:28:05,960
It makes sense.

2783
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:10,040
I mean, why have it just for consistency across the board?

2784
02:28:10,040 --> 02:28:15,560
Why would you have a separate login for the Java version versus everything else?

2785
02:28:15,560 --> 02:28:19,320
You just, it's much more simpler than maintain one system.

2786
02:28:19,320 --> 02:28:21,400
Especially one that they're using across all their products.

2787
02:28:21,400 --> 02:28:25,400
I don't see the point in having to create a separate login and maintain that.

2788
02:28:25,400 --> 02:28:28,040
Um, it's much easier.

2789
02:28:28,040 --> 02:28:30,600
And plus this way too, it makes it a lot easier.

2790
02:28:30,600 --> 02:28:34,440
Cause, um, I know I'm not sure if they're still offering it, but they used to be, if

2791
02:28:34,440 --> 02:28:38,840
you buy the Java version, you get the windows 10 version for free.

2792
02:28:38,840 --> 02:28:44,920
And it's just easier to link that all together this way versus having to give you a key that

2793
02:28:44,920 --> 02:28:50,920
you then go log into your windows 10 account and, you know, get the game that way.

2794
02:28:50,920 --> 02:28:52,040
It doesn't make any sense.

2795
02:28:52,040 --> 02:28:53,640
It's just, it's much easier.

2796
02:28:53,640 --> 02:28:58,520
So, uh, and I, I'm, I also failed to see what the big deal is about this, honestly,

2797
02:28:58,520 --> 02:29:00,840
but I want to, you know, let every gamer have a voice.

2798
02:29:00,840 --> 02:29:06,040
And I see in chat, Zen monkey 11 says, no, thank you Mojang and says, just make Java

2799
02:29:06,040 --> 02:29:07,800
open source or leave it be.

2800
02:29:07,800 --> 02:29:11,960
And I can kind of get that perspective is that, you know, Java is kind of like, wow,

2801
02:29:11,960 --> 02:29:14,760
classic in a way, you know, it's, it's caters to

2802
02:29:14,760 --> 02:29:16,360
a very specific audience.

2803
02:29:16,360 --> 02:29:20,280
Um, and I can also understand where it's just kind of like, just, just let it, let it,

2804
02:29:20,280 --> 02:29:23,000
let it live in its own little corner and stop bothering it.

2805
02:29:24,040 --> 02:29:25,000
Do you see that perspective?

2806
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:25,500
Loki?

2807
02:29:26,360 --> 02:29:29,000
No, I mean, they're, they're still doing upgrades for it and everything.

2808
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,800
I don't see, I don't really see an issue with this.

2809
02:29:31,800 --> 02:29:37,320
I don't equate this to be the same thing as, um, what Facebook's doing with Oculus.

2810
02:29:37,320 --> 02:29:39,480
Well, and it is, it isn't, I'm saying some people.

2811
02:29:39,480 --> 02:29:42,840
And I also agree cause Rama says that's a stretch and I agree.

2812
02:29:42,840 --> 02:29:45,960
And Bobby says the Facebook Oculus thing is because Facebook can decide you shouldn't

2813
02:29:45,960 --> 02:29:47,320
have an account for whatever reason.

2814
02:29:47,320 --> 02:29:49,480
And that means you can't use an Oculus device.

2815
02:29:49,480 --> 02:29:53,640
For instance, if you don't use your exact legal name, boom, no Oculus.

2816
02:29:53,640 --> 02:29:59,560
Um, which is one of many reasons why I'm going to say I will never buy an Oculus and I'm

2817
02:29:59,560 --> 02:30:04,040
going to encourage all my friends, including Bobby Blackwolf, who is a VR guru.

2818
02:30:04,040 --> 02:30:04,600
I understand.

2819
02:30:04,600 --> 02:30:05,640
But I already have one.

2820
02:30:06,200 --> 02:30:06,600
You know what?

2821
02:30:06,600 --> 02:30:07,240
And that's fine.

2822
02:30:07,240 --> 02:30:10,920
And I understand because Bobby might be like, I need one because I'm such an enthusiast.

2823
02:30:10,920 --> 02:30:11,400
Fine.

2824
02:30:11,400 --> 02:30:12,280
I'll let it go.

2825
02:30:12,280 --> 02:30:14,120
But I'm going to be actively encouraging people.

2826
02:30:14,120 --> 02:30:19,400
I know not to buy Oculus because then there was a whole thing this week about you can't

2827
02:30:19,400 --> 02:30:21,400
like share things on the store.

2828
02:30:21,400 --> 02:30:24,120
Or like if you delete your Facebook account, then you basically lose everything you've

2829
02:30:24,120 --> 02:30:24,840
bought.

2830
02:30:24,840 --> 02:30:26,920
It's it's bad.

2831
02:30:26,920 --> 02:30:29,000
Like, no, thank you.

2832
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:36,200
I mean, I will say thank you Facebook for making the decision of which VR platform to

2833
02:30:36,200 --> 02:30:41,720
go with on the PC a lot easier for me by taking yourselves out of the equation.

2834
02:30:42,280 --> 02:30:44,360
Thank you.

2835
02:30:44,360 --> 02:30:48,280
You can't have multiple quests, one quest per account, because they're afraid you're

2836
02:30:48,280 --> 02:30:50,760
going to give a quest with your account to someone else.

2837
02:30:50,760 --> 02:30:51,320
Yeah.

2838
02:30:51,320 --> 02:30:51,960
But all right.

2839
02:30:51,960 --> 02:30:54,280
Anyway, so I think I think we've made it very clear.

2840
02:30:54,280 --> 02:30:57,080
It's not the same thing, even though some people are trying to say it is.

2841
02:30:57,080 --> 02:31:02,120
But I also like this way, like like I think here's one of the things I think that they're

2842
02:31:02,120 --> 02:31:02,440
trying to do.

2843
02:31:02,440 --> 02:31:08,280
They're trying to get parity across Java and the bedrock conditions already.

2844
02:31:08,280 --> 02:31:14,360
So what I think they're trying to shoot for here is with maybe 117 that they're going

2845
02:31:14,360 --> 02:31:15,560
to try.

2846
02:31:15,560 --> 02:31:20,440
Maybe they're going to have enabled some sort of cross play option for Java and bedrock

2847
02:31:21,080 --> 02:31:24,840
to be able to do it that way, because I know right now it's still very different.

2848
02:31:24,840 --> 02:31:27,560
And there's like features that are in one that aren't in the other one.

2849
02:31:27,560 --> 02:31:31,720
But maybe the end goal is to have everybody be able to play together if they want to.

2850
02:31:32,440 --> 02:31:37,800
And definitely, you know, the new log in doesn't affect anything like modding or using like

2851
02:31:37,880 --> 02:31:39,240
bucket or any of that stuff.

2852
02:31:39,800 --> 02:31:46,200
It's just strictly instead of using your Microsoft to count the log in, you'll use your or your

2853
02:31:46,200 --> 02:31:47,400
Minecraft log in.

2854
02:31:47,400 --> 02:31:49,400
You'll just use your Microsoft log in.

2855
02:31:49,400 --> 02:31:49,640
Okay.

2856
02:31:50,600 --> 02:31:51,240
All right.

2857
02:31:51,240 --> 02:31:55,480
Well, let's move on and talk about another hot Microsoft property, and that's Halo.

2858
02:31:55,480 --> 02:32:02,920
And Halo, the Master Chief Collection, I believe was a launch title for Xbox One, if I am not

2859
02:32:02,920 --> 02:32:03,560
mistaken.

2860
02:32:03,560 --> 02:32:04,920
No, maybe not a launch title.

2861
02:32:04,920 --> 02:32:06,280
It was pretty close.

2862
02:32:06,280 --> 02:32:08,440
It was pretty close, if not like a launch.

2863
02:32:08,440 --> 02:32:13,160
But anyway, it had some rough spots when it first came out, but they've been working on

2864
02:32:13,160 --> 02:32:16,280
it consistently really throughout the years to make it better.

2865
02:32:16,280 --> 02:32:17,880
And it's in a really good place right now.

2866
02:32:17,880 --> 02:32:23,160
And it's going to be further upgraded to essentially be a bit of a launch title for Xbox Series

2867
02:32:23,160 --> 02:32:25,480
X as well as S as well.

2868
02:32:27,080 --> 02:32:32,040
So November 17th, Halo, the Master Chief Collection is going to get some upgrades.

2869
02:32:32,040 --> 02:32:38,840
And that means you will now be able to play the game at 120 frames a second on both X

2870
02:32:38,840 --> 02:32:42,680
and S. On X, you can do this in 4K.

2871
02:32:42,680 --> 02:32:43,880
That's pretty cool.

2872
02:32:43,880 --> 02:32:46,520
So it's going to be a smooth game.

2873
02:32:46,520 --> 02:32:48,760
Can I find a TV that can actually support that?

2874
02:32:48,760 --> 02:32:49,400
Probably not.

2875
02:32:50,200 --> 02:32:52,600
Oh, but as a quick aside, Loki, you might get a kick out of this.

2876
02:32:52,600 --> 02:32:55,160
I bought my 4K TV yesterday.

2877
02:32:55,160 --> 02:32:58,840
It's just I'm having it delivered so that they can take the box and all that crap out

2878
02:32:58,840 --> 02:33:00,280
of here and that stuff.

2879
02:33:00,840 --> 02:33:01,880
I did it all through Costco.

2880
02:33:01,880 --> 02:33:03,400
It's only 20 bucks to do that through Costco.

2881
02:33:03,400 --> 02:33:04,120
So I was like, whatever.

2882
02:33:05,240 --> 02:33:07,080
And so I bought my TV.

2883
02:33:07,080 --> 02:33:09,640
So and I'm sure you're all dying to know, what did I end up going with?

2884
02:33:09,640 --> 02:33:12,040
Did I get the OLED I'd been talking about?

2885
02:33:12,840 --> 02:33:13,880
No, I did not.

2886
02:33:13,880 --> 02:33:18,200
I finally decided that was just a little too expensive for me.

2887
02:33:18,200 --> 02:33:19,400
Not knocking the TV.

2888
02:33:19,400 --> 02:33:21,320
They're pretty devices.

2889
02:33:21,320 --> 02:33:22,840
So I did not get that.

2890
02:33:22,840 --> 02:33:30,120
I did get the Samsung QLED, which was kind of like the other kind of fancier

2891
02:33:30,120 --> 02:33:30,840
LED.

2892
02:33:30,840 --> 02:33:34,840
I'm aware it's not the same thing as OLED and the whole concept of the pure black and

2893
02:33:34,840 --> 02:33:35,480
all that stuff.

2894
02:33:35,480 --> 02:33:41,160
But I felt for the price I was willing to spend, it was pretty enough.

2895
02:33:42,600 --> 02:33:44,920
So that's my new TV.

2896
02:33:44,920 --> 02:33:47,480
And that's getting here on this coming Friday.

2897
02:33:47,480 --> 02:33:49,880
So I'll be able to talk more about that on the next OLR.

2898
02:33:49,880 --> 02:33:53,800
But I will actually be able to enjoy my Xbox Series X.

2899
02:33:53,800 --> 02:33:57,160
That's another reason I had to be a little bit price conscious is like getting a TV and

2900
02:33:57,160 --> 02:33:58,120
a new console.

2901
02:33:58,360 --> 02:34:00,440
I could not do a TV and two new consoles.

2902
02:34:00,440 --> 02:34:02,840
So PlayStation 5 has to wait for next year.

2903
02:34:02,840 --> 02:34:08,520
But TV and one console, it's going to be nice that I'm going to be having that because it's

2904
02:34:08,520 --> 02:34:11,560
almost like it's going to be just a new gaming experience.

2905
02:34:11,560 --> 02:34:15,160
It's the first time I really will have been doing a lot of gaming in 4K.

2906
02:34:15,160 --> 02:34:17,640
I've done this much on my PC.

2907
02:34:17,640 --> 02:34:21,480
And it's things that will actually run on my current setup in 4K, which is stuff like

2908
02:34:21,480 --> 02:34:22,600
Diablo 3.

2909
02:34:22,600 --> 02:34:24,120
Wow, wow is 4K right now.

2910
02:34:25,320 --> 02:34:25,800
So yeah.

2911
02:34:25,800 --> 02:34:28,440
So I'm really excited to check something like this out.

2912
02:34:28,440 --> 02:34:30,600
Like Halo, the Master Chief Collection.

2913
02:34:30,600 --> 02:34:37,480
And I think it's pretty nice on Xbox how you have Game Pass is going to have all these

2914
02:34:37,480 --> 02:34:38,120
games on it.

2915
02:34:38,120 --> 02:34:44,200
It's like you're going to have quite a few games to check out right away or yeah.

2916
02:34:45,320 --> 02:34:49,160
Only Sonic says you need HDMI 2.1 or something like that.

2917
02:34:49,160 --> 02:34:50,360
This TV does have it.

2918
02:34:50,360 --> 02:34:51,960
So it's a new enough model to have that.

2919
02:34:52,760 --> 02:34:54,840
DJ Rama S says Rob, what size TV?

2920
02:34:54,840 --> 02:34:57,640
65 inch, which is five inches more than I have now.

2921
02:34:59,080 --> 02:35:02,760
No one special says can the human eye even see 120 frames per second?

2922
02:35:05,400 --> 02:35:05,880
I don't know.

2923
02:35:05,880 --> 02:35:10,840
I didn't think they could see 60 and yet I can see it for what it is.

2924
02:35:10,840 --> 02:35:12,040
So anyway.

2925
02:35:13,720 --> 02:35:15,160
All right, let's move on.

2926
02:35:17,320 --> 02:35:17,800
Next story.

2927
02:35:17,800 --> 02:35:18,920
You want to talk about this, Logie?

2928
02:35:19,800 --> 02:35:20,520
It's our favorite.

2929
02:35:20,520 --> 02:35:21,640
It's our favorite company.

2930
02:35:21,960 --> 02:35:35,400
Yeah, so Konami has re-upped their trademarks for Goemon and apparently a spinoff of the

2931
02:35:35,400 --> 02:35:37,080
Suikoden series.

2932
02:35:37,080 --> 02:35:44,840
So they've upped their trademark for Gensou Sui Gaiden and Ganbare Goemon, an emotional

2933
02:35:44,840 --> 02:35:45,560
voice system.

2934
02:35:45,560 --> 02:35:53,240
So that was the system that was implemented by the Tokimeki Memorial series.

2935
02:35:53,240 --> 02:35:53,800
Oh, yeah.

2936
02:35:57,480 --> 02:35:58,040
Cool.

2937
02:35:58,040 --> 02:36:00,280
I wonder what they plan on doing with that.

2938
02:36:00,280 --> 02:36:04,280
They probably don't necessarily plan on doing much with it aside from maybe re-releasing

2939
02:36:04,280 --> 02:36:07,560
some of this stuff or doing collections or something.

2940
02:36:07,560 --> 02:36:09,960
Maybe they'll do a Goemon collection.

2941
02:36:10,920 --> 02:36:14,840
Going on collection would be awesome, especially with all these collections on the Switch where

2942
02:36:15,720 --> 02:36:18,440
the Mana collection where they actually localize things.

2943
02:36:18,440 --> 02:36:21,240
Like, I would give Konami a little credit.

2944
02:36:21,240 --> 02:36:22,440
A little credit.

2945
02:36:22,440 --> 02:36:24,360
I love The Legend of the Mystical Ninja.

2946
02:36:24,360 --> 02:36:26,280
Yeah, there's a ton of Goemon games.

2947
02:36:26,280 --> 02:36:28,040
They should localize some more and put them out.

2948
02:36:28,040 --> 02:36:28,760
I think that'd be cool.

2949
02:36:30,360 --> 02:36:31,960
Not Nino Kuni collection.

2950
02:36:31,960 --> 02:36:32,520
Sorry.

2951
02:36:32,520 --> 02:36:37,240
Kunio Kun collection that came out not that long ago with all the River City Ransom games

2952
02:36:37,960 --> 02:36:42,120
and those guys and all those NES games, like the soccer game and stuff that had never

2953
02:36:42,120 --> 02:36:45,720
come out on here locally.

2954
02:36:45,720 --> 02:36:46,760
I think that would be really awesome.

2955
02:36:47,640 --> 02:36:53,320
Orange Rite does point out they did just announce a new Tokimeki Memorial game for the Switch.

2956
02:36:53,320 --> 02:36:56,600
It's a girl's side game, if I recall correctly.

2957
02:36:56,600 --> 02:36:58,440
I hope they make another anniversary collection.

2958
02:36:58,440 --> 02:36:59,400
Those were neat.

2959
02:36:59,400 --> 02:37:02,360
And Pesto Pacas is laughing at my Nino Kuni collection.

2960
02:37:02,360 --> 02:37:06,440
Well, with that news on level five last week, sadly, that's never going to happen.

2961
02:37:06,440 --> 02:37:08,360
That's sad.

2962
02:37:08,360 --> 02:37:11,800
So but yeah, I you know what?

2963
02:37:11,800 --> 02:37:15,480
I didn't think it would necessarily be for a Goemon collection.

2964
02:37:15,480 --> 02:37:20,440
I thought, oh, maybe they're working on a new game, but I somehow the idea of a Goemon

2965
02:37:20,440 --> 02:37:23,080
collection as opposed to them doing a new game sounds better.

2966
02:37:24,360 --> 02:37:26,520
Stick to what you stick to your history.

2967
02:37:29,080 --> 02:37:29,800
All right.

2968
02:37:29,800 --> 02:37:30,440
Yeah.

2969
02:37:30,440 --> 02:37:30,920
Yeah.

2970
02:37:30,920 --> 02:37:31,160
All right.

2971
02:37:31,160 --> 02:37:32,440
You have another one for us, Logie.

2972
02:37:34,120 --> 02:37:38,200
Sorry, I've been like trying to fight with the new PlayStation.

2973
02:37:38,200 --> 02:37:40,200
Store page, the website.

2974
02:37:40,200 --> 02:37:43,640
Oh, no, I haven't looked at it and I heard it's garbage.

2975
02:37:43,640 --> 02:37:44,600
It's garbage.

2976
02:37:44,600 --> 02:37:51,880
So like I forgot to get my PlayStation Plus games for October and I have this button here

2977
02:37:51,880 --> 02:37:53,160
says join PlayStation Plus.

2978
02:37:53,160 --> 02:37:57,800
I'm like, well, that's weird because I'm on PlayStation Plus and I've already been paying

2979
02:37:57,800 --> 02:37:58,360
for it.

2980
02:37:58,360 --> 02:38:00,920
So why can't I download my games?

2981
02:38:00,920 --> 02:38:02,520
And that's just in a big loop.

2982
02:38:02,520 --> 02:38:03,960
Get the games, click the button.

2983
02:38:03,960 --> 02:38:05,880
It takes me to a page where they want me to join.

2984
02:38:06,280 --> 02:38:08,600
But I've already joined and I'm also logged in.

2985
02:38:08,600 --> 02:38:11,240
So what the hell?

2986
02:38:12,120 --> 02:38:13,000
It's garbage.

2987
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
Did they add titles of games yet?

2988
02:38:17,560 --> 02:38:18,840
We mean titles of games.

2989
02:38:18,840 --> 02:38:20,200
I guess I was like, I don't know.

2990
02:38:20,200 --> 02:38:23,880
They said I was reading some website that was like, when you're in the store, you see

2991
02:38:23,880 --> 02:38:26,600
the box art, but you don't even see what the whole name of the game.

2992
02:38:26,600 --> 02:38:32,200
And you can't even see what is Minecraft, the game versus Minecraft DLC packs and all

2993
02:38:32,200 --> 02:38:32,840
this other stuff.

2994
02:38:32,840 --> 02:38:34,120
It's just so hard to tell the difference.

2995
02:38:34,120 --> 02:38:34,680
I don't know.

2996
02:38:34,680 --> 02:38:38,440
Right now, I'm on the PlayStation Plus page and it's all get the game.

2997
02:38:38,440 --> 02:38:39,320
So I click the button.

2998
02:38:39,320 --> 02:38:44,120
It takes me back to the PlayStation Plus page, which says join PlayStation Plus.

2999
02:38:44,120 --> 02:38:46,280
I don't want to join it because I already have.

3000
02:38:46,280 --> 02:38:46,840
I'm on it.

3001
02:38:46,840 --> 02:38:47,480
It renews.

3002
02:38:47,480 --> 02:38:48,440
In fact, a couple of days.

3003
02:38:51,640 --> 02:38:53,160
So I guess I got to go through my system.

3004
02:38:56,120 --> 02:38:57,240
What the hell, man?

3005
02:38:57,240 --> 02:38:58,280
I don't get it.

3006
02:38:58,280 --> 02:38:59,400
Anyways, sorry.

3007
02:38:59,400 --> 02:39:00,760
No, it's fine.

3008
02:39:00,760 --> 02:39:02,440
I want to know how that was greenlit too.

3009
02:39:02,440 --> 02:39:08,840
Um, but anyways, so let's talk a little bit about, uh, actually funny enough, I forgot

3010
02:39:08,840 --> 02:39:11,080
to mention this back when we were talking about Minecraft.

3011
02:39:11,080 --> 02:39:16,920
So you may remember that Minecraft, uh, Steve was added to, uh, super smash brothers.

3012
02:39:16,920 --> 02:39:22,200
Well, there's been a small tweak that they have done because apparently it wasn't that

3013
02:39:22,200 --> 02:39:22,520
small.

3014
02:39:24,600 --> 02:39:29,320
His winning pose had him holding a cooked piece of beef.

3015
02:39:29,320 --> 02:39:34,200
And fortunately it looked like a pixelated penis, um, on the screen.

3016
02:39:35,320 --> 02:39:37,000
How did that get by the Nintendo?

3017
02:39:38,440 --> 02:39:38,920
I don't know.

3018
02:39:38,920 --> 02:39:39,560
Whatever.

3019
02:39:39,560 --> 02:39:40,360
It's pretty funny.

3020
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,160
So they said, Steve, you need to put your meat away.

3021
02:39:44,040 --> 02:39:44,440
Yes.

3022
02:39:44,440 --> 02:39:47,160
So you're excited you want, but you need to put your meat away.

3023
02:39:47,160 --> 02:39:49,160
He's not holding his meat anymore.

3024
02:39:49,160 --> 02:39:50,280
Um, so that's funny.

3025
02:39:51,080 --> 02:39:51,800
Okay.

3026
02:39:51,800 --> 02:39:57,480
So, um, if we still, you know, back to, you know, kind of a throwback to when we were

3027
02:39:57,480 --> 02:40:04,600
talking about earlier, how, um, certain, certain people at certain game companies feel that,

3028
02:40:04,600 --> 02:40:10,360
you know, gamers should pay to stream their games because they aren't making enough money.

3029
02:40:10,920 --> 02:40:17,960
Well, I mean, as if it's any surprise with sports games, it's gotten ridiculous with

3030
02:40:17,960 --> 02:40:22,680
the amount of like, um, stuff that they're throwing in people's faces.

3031
02:40:22,680 --> 02:40:29,640
So UFC tried this a while back EA, um, putting, you know, little ad bumpers in there as well.

3032
02:40:29,640 --> 02:40:32,600
Well, NBA 2k now has unskippable ads.

3033
02:40:33,160 --> 02:40:38,520
That load before the, um, the game street fighter, street fighter five houses too.

3034
02:40:38,520 --> 02:40:40,680
Cause it was a PlayStation plus game last month.

3035
02:40:40,680 --> 02:40:44,600
And when you, before you get set up for a match, it's like present this match presented by,

3036
02:40:44,600 --> 02:40:48,040
and like every single one I was getting was like the Capcom cup or whatever it was

3037
02:40:48,040 --> 02:40:48,840
going on at the time.

3038
02:40:48,920 --> 02:40:53,000
So it was a, it was a local ad, but it was, I kind of rolled my eyes.

3039
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:53,560
Yeah.

3040
02:40:53,560 --> 02:40:59,400
So, so they have an unskippable ads for stuff like, you know, uh, converse snowfall,

3041
02:40:59,400 --> 02:41:02,440
Oculus quest, um, all sorts of things.

3042
02:41:03,160 --> 02:41:04,520
It's ridiculous.

3043
02:41:04,520 --> 02:41:08,520
Also considering I'm kind of curious to see what's going to happen with this one.

3044
02:41:10,120 --> 02:41:11,160
I mean, cause I, I get it.

3045
02:41:11,160 --> 02:41:15,400
They're doing it while it's loading, but you know, these next gen systems are going to load

3046
02:41:15,400 --> 02:41:16,600
much, much, much faster.

3047
02:41:17,160 --> 02:41:20,760
Are they just going to artificially increase that load time in order to do these ads?

3048
02:41:22,440 --> 02:41:23,720
It's it's garbage.

3049
02:41:23,720 --> 02:41:29,640
Anyways, NBA 2k has basically put out a tweet, uh, seeing as many of you are aware in the

3050
02:41:29,640 --> 02:41:33,960
recent years, ads have been integrated into 2k TV segments.

3051
02:41:33,960 --> 02:41:39,560
Yesterday's 2k TV ad placement impacted our players experience in a way we didn't intend

3052
02:41:39,560 --> 02:41:40,440
bullshit.

3053
02:41:40,440 --> 02:41:45,720
Um, as these ads are not meant to run as part of the pregame introduction, this will be

3054
02:41:45,720 --> 02:41:47,400
fixed in future episodes.

3055
02:41:47,400 --> 02:41:49,560
Thank you for your continued feedback.

3056
02:41:49,560 --> 02:41:51,400
I don't buy that one bit.

3057
02:41:51,400 --> 02:41:56,440
I think they just, they make the excuse, well, we didn't intend for this to happen, but.

3058
02:41:57,640 --> 02:41:58,440
Well, it did.

3059
02:41:59,400 --> 02:42:00,920
They're like, oops, we made a mistake.

3060
02:42:00,920 --> 02:42:01,720
Whoopsie doops.

3061
02:42:01,720 --> 02:42:04,200
You know, they're just waiting to see what the reaction is going to be.

3062
02:42:05,240 --> 02:42:11,000
I'm telling you these guys that are trying to fleece everybody for, you know, microtransactions

3063
02:42:11,080 --> 02:42:15,240
and season passes and all of this nonsense each year.

3064
02:42:15,240 --> 02:42:21,480
Um, you know, not, well, I don't know so much about 2k, but like EA doesn't really even

3065
02:42:21,480 --> 02:42:25,960
update their game very much year to year taking away features, selling those back to you or

3066
02:42:25,960 --> 02:42:27,000
whatever the case may be.

3067
02:42:27,640 --> 02:42:33,640
Um, and there's still demanding more money on top of all this, like, you know, endorsements

3068
02:42:33,640 --> 02:42:40,120
with different, you know, food brands or, you know, with shoes or advertisements, you

3069
02:42:40,120 --> 02:42:44,920
know, throwing stuff, they're making money, like tons of money off of this stuff.

3070
02:42:44,920 --> 02:42:46,520
You can't tell me that.

3071
02:42:46,520 --> 02:42:52,280
And then they're going to, you know, not them particularly, but I could easily see them

3072
02:42:52,280 --> 02:42:53,160
jumping on board.

3073
02:42:53,160 --> 02:42:58,200
If some AAA studio decided to start charging people to stream their games, get right on

3074
02:42:58,200 --> 02:43:00,040
board with that because, Hey, that's money.

3075
02:43:00,040 --> 02:43:01,640
Why not have all the money?

3076
02:43:01,640 --> 02:43:03,880
Um, I could easily see them doing that.

3077
02:43:03,880 --> 02:43:08,120
I mean, 2k and EA, I mean, it's just bad.

3078
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:11,800
All right.

3079
02:43:11,800 --> 02:43:13,320
What, uh, there's another thing with EA, right?

3080
02:43:14,040 --> 02:43:14,440
Yes.

3081
02:43:14,440 --> 02:43:21,080
So EA talking about, um, you know, they're incredible, uh, loot box systems that they

3082
02:43:21,080 --> 02:43:23,000
have with Madden and whatnot.

3083
02:43:23,800 --> 02:43:30,120
Apparently they're the case that's pending in Canada, a class action lawsuit against

3084
02:43:30,120 --> 02:43:37,000
EA, um, regarding their loot boxes that violates the country's criminal code, basically accusing

3085
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:40,360
them of running unlicensed illegal gambling systems.

3086
02:43:41,160 --> 02:43:47,160
And they're seeking damages for unjust enrichment arising from the defendant's operation of

3087
02:43:47,160 --> 02:43:52,280
illegal gambling systems through the sale of so-called loot boxes in popular video games.

3088
02:43:52,280 --> 02:43:56,200
Well, you know, this, this is serious shit when Canadians are not going to be polite

3089
02:43:56,200 --> 02:43:57,000
about it anymore.

3090
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,480
This is the legal part of it.

3091
02:44:00,520 --> 02:44:02,840
You don't know what will be in those loot boxes.

3092
02:44:02,840 --> 02:44:06,120
And I'm not sure if they necessarily upfront with the odds on that stuff.

3093
02:44:06,120 --> 02:44:12,600
They may be, but like, it's still, yeah, it's, it's still something that of course

3094
02:44:12,600 --> 02:44:17,320
that several countries have brought up as far as saying that this type of stuff would

3095
02:44:17,320 --> 02:44:18,520
fall under gambling laws.

3096
02:44:18,520 --> 02:44:19,880
So I'm surprised that they haven't.

3097
02:44:19,880 --> 02:44:25,960
In other words, the PlayStation five and Xbox series X launches may be a good time to get

3098
02:44:25,960 --> 02:44:27,000
rid of this crap.

3099
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:33,640
Although we know they're not, we know, but, um, maybe Canada's not so subtly suggesting

3100
02:44:33,640 --> 02:44:35,160
now is a good time to change their habits.

3101
02:44:36,200 --> 02:44:36,600
Yeah.

3102
02:44:36,600 --> 02:44:41,320
Um, so yeah, I don't know.

3103
02:44:41,320 --> 02:44:42,440
I don't think they're going to change.

3104
02:44:43,960 --> 02:44:45,960
Not until somebody steps in.

3105
02:44:45,960 --> 02:44:46,280
Yeah.

3106
02:44:46,280 --> 02:44:48,760
Until someone steps in to make them accountable.

3107
02:44:48,760 --> 02:44:53,000
Here I am yet again this year sitting here saying Canada, save us all.

3108
02:44:53,720 --> 02:44:54,120
All right.

3109
02:44:55,960 --> 02:44:56,360
All right.

3110
02:44:56,920 --> 02:44:57,800
Moving on.

3111
02:44:57,800 --> 02:44:58,200
Let's talk.

3112
02:44:58,200 --> 02:45:02,040
I seriously love Canada and all my Canadian friends hearts.

3113
02:45:02,040 --> 02:45:02,840
All right.

3114
02:45:02,840 --> 02:45:03,400
Moving on.

3115
02:45:04,200 --> 02:45:05,400
Let's talk about.

3116
02:45:05,400 --> 02:45:07,000
Oh, you know who else needs money?

3117
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:07,560
Atari.

3118
02:45:08,680 --> 02:45:11,320
Cause I don't think that computer is going to sell.

3119
02:45:11,320 --> 02:45:13,880
Like I couldn't even tell you, is it the Atari VCS?

3120
02:45:13,880 --> 02:45:14,760
Is that what they're calling it?

3121
02:45:15,960 --> 02:45:18,040
I, this is a problem.

3122
02:45:18,600 --> 02:45:19,960
Number one, this is a problem.

3123
02:45:19,960 --> 02:45:24,600
I could tell you more about that Intellivision Amico, uh, than I could Atari system.

3124
02:45:24,600 --> 02:45:26,120
And that's no shade against Intellivision.

3125
02:45:26,120 --> 02:45:26,920
I'm not here to do that.

3126
02:45:26,920 --> 02:45:27,960
It's so expensive.

3127
02:45:27,960 --> 02:45:29,880
Their system is so expensive.

3128
02:45:29,880 --> 02:45:35,000
I could tell you anything about that new Atari, except that $350 for the Atari thing.

3129
02:45:35,160 --> 02:45:39,240
I think it's a real computer slash it plays Atari stuff slash.

3130
02:45:39,240 --> 02:45:42,920
At one point I heard and stream was on it, but then I'm not hearing that anymore.

3131
02:45:42,920 --> 02:45:45,320
Um, so it's a computer.

3132
02:45:45,320 --> 02:45:45,880
Like it's.

3133
02:45:47,960 --> 02:45:51,160
So anyway, let's talk about something besides that's not that.

3134
02:45:51,160 --> 02:45:51,800
Okay.

3135
02:45:51,800 --> 02:45:59,400
This, this, I understand, uh, Atari teaming up with Eunice, U N I S U N I S, uh, to release

3136
02:45:59,400 --> 02:46:02,600
a Pong arcade machine for your home.

3137
02:46:02,920 --> 02:46:07,080
This is a little different than the, uh, table sized ones that are a little more akin to

3138
02:46:07,080 --> 02:46:09,400
like an arcade one, a one up bar top.

3139
02:46:09,400 --> 02:46:11,400
This is a Pong mini.

3140
02:46:11,400 --> 02:46:17,000
So it's a 7.9 inch LCD string screen and two dial controls that you can play.

3141
02:46:17,640 --> 02:46:21,640
Pong with 10, excuse me, 10 different difficulty settings.

3142
02:46:21,640 --> 02:46:25,160
Uh, there's no battery built in, so it runs on AA batteries.

3143
02:46:25,880 --> 02:46:30,840
But, um, it's Pong, so I don't expect it's going to use a lot of power, uh, but you can

3144
02:46:30,840 --> 02:46:33,640
also power it with a USB cable and adapters.

3145
02:46:33,640 --> 02:46:36,120
So if you don't want to use batteries, you're trying to be eco-friendly, whatever, you do

3146
02:46:36,120 --> 02:46:37,880
have that option as well.

3147
02:46:37,880 --> 02:46:40,920
Uh, you can get it this holiday season.

3148
02:46:40,920 --> 02:46:45,480
Uh, Arcade One Up will actually be distributing this here in North America because U N I S

3149
02:46:45,480 --> 02:46:46,840
is a Chinese company.

3150
02:46:46,840 --> 02:46:49,880
Uh, no pricing details yet or pre-order details yet.

3151
02:46:49,880 --> 02:46:50,200
Yeah.

3152
02:46:50,200 --> 02:46:53,880
I noticed, by the way, I was at Target today and I didn't even realize this was a market

3153
02:46:53,880 --> 02:46:59,000
Arcade One Up was getting into, but they are beyond just the, uh, replica arcade machines

3154
02:46:59,000 --> 02:46:59,640
stuff now.

3155
02:46:59,640 --> 02:47:04,440
Those little controllers that have games in them, Arcade One Up is doing those now.

3156
02:47:05,080 --> 02:47:06,760
Yeah, they're garbage.

3157
02:47:06,760 --> 02:47:07,240
Are they?

3158
02:47:07,240 --> 02:47:11,960
I saw a Mega Man one, which I don't know why I'd get that because it exists on the switch

3159
02:47:11,960 --> 02:47:17,160
and there was a Namco Pac-Man slash Mappy slash, uh, those games won.

3160
02:47:17,800 --> 02:47:19,240
So here's the fun thing about those.

3161
02:47:19,240 --> 02:47:23,960
So they, they are kind of garbage based on the reviews that I've watched for them.

3162
02:47:23,960 --> 02:47:26,760
Um, it's mainly that the controller is kind of garbage.

3163
02:47:26,760 --> 02:47:31,400
The games themselves emulate just fine, but you can actually, they're emulation boxes.

3164
02:47:31,400 --> 02:47:37,080
You can load other games onto them, um, using an SD card, which is kind of cool.

3165
02:47:37,080 --> 02:47:41,640
And then with that, you can also like hook up USB controllers to it and stuff.

3166
02:47:41,640 --> 02:47:46,360
So it might be worth it for that, but like the, the included controller is not good.

3167
02:47:47,400 --> 02:47:47,880
Okay.

3168
02:47:47,880 --> 02:47:48,680
Okay.

3169
02:47:48,680 --> 02:47:49,240
Interesting.

3170
02:47:49,880 --> 02:47:50,120
All right.

3171
02:47:50,120 --> 02:47:51,080
Well, I just thought it was interesting.

3172
02:47:51,080 --> 02:47:52,760
They were getting into that line of business anyway.

3173
02:47:52,760 --> 02:47:53,000
Sorry.

3174
02:47:53,080 --> 02:47:56,120
The story was actually supposed to be about, um, Atari and the mini Pong,

3175
02:47:56,120 --> 02:48:00,200
but it just shows to go arcade one up is really like, they're pre-

3176
02:48:00,200 --> 02:48:03,960
I feel like two years ago, I didn't know a thing about these guys.

3177
02:48:03,960 --> 02:48:07,640
And then as much as a year ago, it was like, oh, I'll never be able to afford that shit.

3178
02:48:07,640 --> 02:48:09,480
Anyway, that's a company for rich people.

3179
02:48:09,480 --> 02:48:12,440
And now I feel like they're showing up everywhere, you know?

3180
02:48:12,440 --> 02:48:13,800
So this is very interesting.

3181
02:48:14,440 --> 02:48:19,400
So, um, but you know, uh, you know, we're, we're, we're the 40 somethings now.

3182
02:48:19,400 --> 02:48:21,880
I know you're not 40 yet, Loki, but we're, we're-

3183
02:48:21,880 --> 02:48:22,440
I am.

3184
02:48:22,440 --> 02:48:23,320
Oh no, that's right.

3185
02:48:23,320 --> 02:48:24,760
You just hit that on September.

3186
02:48:24,760 --> 02:48:25,480
Yes, that's right.

3187
02:48:25,480 --> 02:48:26,840
So, so brand new.

3188
02:48:26,840 --> 02:48:29,320
I wanted, I wanted to-

3189
02:48:29,320 --> 02:48:29,560
Okay.

3190
02:48:30,600 --> 02:48:33,160
So I'm looking at the Atari VCS page.

3191
02:48:33,160 --> 02:48:33,480
Okay.

3192
02:48:33,480 --> 02:48:35,320
And I can't help but laugh.

3193
02:48:35,320 --> 02:48:37,560
It's just ridiculous stuff that's on here.

3194
02:48:37,560 --> 02:48:39,560
So I saw this thing at the very bottom.

3195
02:48:39,560 --> 02:48:43,480
It said, uh, talking about like the features of their console, you know, it's like Ryzen

3196
02:48:43,480 --> 02:48:47,560
processor, wifi, Bluetooth, Atari speaker hat compatible.

3197
02:48:47,560 --> 02:48:49,640
I'm like, what the hell is that?

3198
02:48:50,280 --> 02:48:53,640
So apparently they've released a hat that has speakers in it.

3199
02:48:54,440 --> 02:48:59,080
You can listen to music or something.

3200
02:48:59,080 --> 02:49:02,200
It's high fidelity microphones and stuff.

3201
02:49:02,840 --> 02:49:05,400
They're in all sorts of businesses, that Atari.

3202
02:49:06,760 --> 02:49:08,440
Hey, whatever happened to the hotels?

3203
02:49:08,440 --> 02:49:09,400
I mean, pandemic.

3204
02:49:09,400 --> 02:49:10,680
Those are still coming.

3205
02:49:10,680 --> 02:49:11,240
Are they really?

3206
02:49:11,240 --> 02:49:13,960
Cause that was the most interesting thing I'd heard.

3207
02:49:13,960 --> 02:49:16,920
It like, as far as like using their brand in a crazy way.

3208
02:49:16,920 --> 02:49:19,400
I thought those hotels sounded fascinating.

3209
02:49:19,560 --> 02:49:26,920
So, um, I'm curious if it, I would, I would stay at one just to see, um, and see if it's,

3210
02:49:26,920 --> 02:49:30,920
you know, what, or if it's kind of like, you know, garbage, but I'd be curious.

3211
02:49:30,920 --> 02:49:32,120
I'd be super curious.

3212
02:49:32,120 --> 02:49:32,600
Super curious.

3213
02:49:33,320 --> 02:49:37,320
DJ Roma S says the speaker hat has been around for a couple of years.

3214
02:49:37,320 --> 02:49:40,440
Bobby Blackwell says, I can't wait to go and stay at hotels again.

3215
02:49:40,440 --> 02:49:45,080
Technically you can, but I, I understand the point you're trying to make and I get it.

3216
02:49:45,560 --> 02:49:50,680
Uh, I can't, I can't wait to get on a plane again and I could if I wanted to, but now,

3217
02:49:51,240 --> 02:49:55,160
now they're going to be, uh, selling the middle seats apparently on my favorite airlines.

3218
02:49:55,160 --> 02:49:57,720
So, uh, I don't know how I feel about that.

3219
02:49:57,720 --> 02:49:59,720
So I'm not in a rush to go anywhere anytime soon.

3220
02:50:00,120 --> 02:50:06,040
Um, especially it's going to be, it's going to be a good several weeks after Thanksgiving

3221
02:50:06,040 --> 02:50:09,080
and Christmas, because those holidays really worry me.

3222
02:50:09,720 --> 02:50:14,760
Uh, I just don't think people are going to give a shit and, uh, we'll see.

3223
02:50:14,840 --> 02:50:15,240
We'll see.

3224
02:50:15,800 --> 02:50:19,400
Um, DJ Roma S says the speaker hat's been around for a while.

3225
02:50:19,400 --> 02:50:20,040
Well, that's cool.

3226
02:50:21,160 --> 02:50:21,480
All right.

3227
02:50:22,040 --> 02:50:25,720
So this is the part where we would get to the listener round table and open up to our

3228
02:50:25,720 --> 02:50:30,040
chat room for your questions, uh, or comments on anything we've talked about tonight or

3229
02:50:30,040 --> 02:50:33,080
anything we haven't talked about yet that you hoped we would talk about.

3230
02:50:33,640 --> 02:50:37,560
I would also typically do the mailbag at this time because you can send your emails every

3231
02:50:37,560 --> 02:50:42,120
week to participate at orangelandradio.com and we read our favorite emails here on the

3232
02:50:42,120 --> 02:50:42,360
air.

3233
02:50:42,360 --> 02:50:44,600
But, um, there's an empty mailbag this week.

3234
02:50:44,600 --> 02:50:45,560
We didn't get anything.

3235
02:50:45,560 --> 02:50:51,160
We've had a, we've had a good run of, uh, mailbag weeks and dark soccer is not even

3236
02:50:51,160 --> 02:50:52,920
here for me to talk about drag race with.

3237
02:50:52,920 --> 02:50:53,720
So now what do I do?

3238
02:50:53,720 --> 02:50:55,240
Loki watching drag race Holland?

3239
02:50:56,280 --> 02:50:57,560
No, damn it.

3240
02:50:57,560 --> 02:50:57,960
All right.

3241
02:50:58,600 --> 02:50:59,080
Uh, okay.

3242
02:51:00,040 --> 02:51:00,360
Good.

3243
02:51:00,360 --> 02:51:00,680
Excellent.

3244
02:51:01,240 --> 02:51:04,440
The chat room here with the save when in doubt, bring it back to food.

3245
02:51:05,080 --> 02:51:05,800
SSU 100.

3246
02:51:05,800 --> 02:51:07,960
Matt says rank your top three Halloween.

3247
02:51:07,960 --> 02:51:10,920
Is it from a distance?

3248
02:51:10,920 --> 02:51:16,360
I thought it said candles and I'm like, um, let's see bed bath and beyond.

3249
02:51:16,360 --> 02:51:17,480
No, I know it's candies.

3250
02:51:17,480 --> 02:51:17,880
All right.

3251
02:51:17,880 --> 02:51:19,960
Rank your top three Halloween candies.

3252
02:51:21,800 --> 02:51:24,280
I don't really eat a lot of candy.

3253
02:51:24,280 --> 02:51:26,600
So like it's always tootsie rolls.

3254
02:51:26,600 --> 02:51:32,280
Um, so that's what I, I've been just buying that stuff, you know, from the store and getting

3255
02:51:32,280 --> 02:51:34,040
that, um, gummy bears.

3256
02:51:34,600 --> 02:51:40,920
Um, and I don't know, I don't really like a lot of the chocolate stuff that they give

3257
02:51:40,920 --> 02:51:41,320
out.

3258
02:51:41,320 --> 02:51:46,360
Um, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it.

3259
02:51:47,160 --> 02:51:52,040
Um, I'm with hot pocketry peanut butter cups, probably very high on the list near the top.

3260
02:51:52,040 --> 02:51:55,720
Um, I would say for Halloween candies, I'm trying to think of things that you usually

3261
02:51:55,720 --> 02:51:57,960
see around Halloween that you don't see other times a year.

3262
02:51:57,960 --> 02:52:02,680
I would actually, I would actually, you know, I never got those in trick or treat bags.

3263
02:52:02,680 --> 02:52:04,440
Uh, and it's not actually my favorite.

3264
02:52:04,440 --> 02:52:06,200
I like it, but it's not my favorite.

3265
02:52:06,200 --> 02:52:11,480
Um, I would say, um, the Wonka candies, I see more this time of year than any other

3266
02:52:11,480 --> 02:52:11,800
time.

3267
02:52:11,800 --> 02:52:16,200
And so specifically like bottle caps, I've always really liked, you know, those, the,

3268
02:52:16,200 --> 02:52:17,720
the soda flavored candy.

3269
02:52:18,520 --> 02:52:21,560
I'm not as big on nerds, uh, and runts.

3270
02:52:21,560 --> 02:52:23,320
I only like the banana ones.

3271
02:52:23,320 --> 02:52:32,440
So, um, so I would say, uh, yeah, uh, uh, bottle caps, um, and, uh, vanilla tootsie

3272
02:52:32,440 --> 02:52:35,720
rolls specifically, or any fruit flavored one.

3273
02:52:35,720 --> 02:52:36,360
I like those as well.

3274
02:52:36,360 --> 02:52:36,600
Yeah.

3275
02:52:36,600 --> 02:52:38,280
I don't know if I like those.

3276
02:52:38,280 --> 02:52:39,080
I don't know.

3277
02:52:39,080 --> 02:52:40,200
We have a bunch.

3278
02:52:40,200 --> 02:52:40,760
I like that.

3279
02:52:40,760 --> 02:52:43,720
I just buy like a five pound bag or a bite, like not five pound bag.

3280
02:52:43,720 --> 02:52:45,400
It's like a $5 bag of that stuff.

3281
02:52:45,400 --> 02:52:47,000
And it lasts for months.

3282
02:52:47,800 --> 02:52:48,040
Yeah.

3283
02:52:48,040 --> 02:52:50,840
And black and Pat says Kit Kats, Snickers and nerds.

3284
02:52:50,840 --> 02:52:51,960
I would agree with Kit Kats.

3285
02:52:52,200 --> 02:52:57,880
I always like, like if I'm just like at the convenience store and I'm like, I want candy.

3286
02:52:57,880 --> 02:53:03,880
I usually will buy a Kit Kat bar or a Twix is the other one that I really like.

3287
02:53:03,880 --> 02:53:07,480
Cause now all these companies are doing their crazy flavors.

3288
02:53:07,480 --> 02:53:11,720
You know, ever since Oreo started doing it now, I feel like every sweets company is doing

3289
02:53:11,720 --> 02:53:13,320
their crazy flavors.

3290
02:53:13,320 --> 02:53:17,880
I guess that was the thing they had to do because of the dieting that everybody's doing.

3291
02:53:18,600 --> 02:53:20,120
Made people start cutting that stuff out.

3292
02:53:20,120 --> 02:53:22,520
So they tried to do crazy flavors to bring people back.

3293
02:53:23,080 --> 02:53:25,960
But like Twix has like a peanut butter Twix.

3294
02:53:25,960 --> 02:53:26,760
That's really good.

3295
02:53:26,760 --> 02:53:27,880
And there's a cookies and cream one.

3296
02:53:27,880 --> 02:53:28,920
That's pretty good too.

3297
02:53:28,920 --> 02:53:36,760
So I'm liking the crazy flavor and Kit Kat is finally, finally doing some crazy flavors

3298
02:53:36,760 --> 02:53:38,200
like they've had in Japan for forever.

3299
02:53:38,200 --> 02:53:40,680
Like there were some apple pie Kit Kats I had not long ago.

3300
02:53:40,680 --> 02:53:41,160
Really good.

3301
02:53:42,600 --> 02:53:44,680
So those would be my answers.

3302
02:53:44,680 --> 02:53:45,320
Good question.

3303
02:53:46,040 --> 02:53:48,680
While we wait to see if any other candy or candies, sure.

3304
02:53:48,680 --> 02:53:49,480
I'll take candy.

3305
02:53:49,480 --> 02:53:53,000
If we wait to see if any other questions come in, uh, Loki, do you have any last minute

3306
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:53,500
stories?

3307
02:53:54,280 --> 02:53:55,080
I don't.

3308
02:53:55,080 --> 02:53:57,000
I was like, I feel like we hit everything.

3309
02:53:58,520 --> 02:54:00,600
It wasn't really that big of a week.

3310
02:54:00,600 --> 02:54:02,520
All things considered, there were just some big moments.

3311
02:54:03,320 --> 02:54:07,960
I was gonna say Epic games has got the, uh, the, the, I know that they've got the, the

3312
02:54:07,960 --> 02:54:09,640
Ghostbusters remaster.

3313
02:54:09,640 --> 02:54:12,360
That's going to be free next week, which is pretty cool.

3314
02:54:12,360 --> 02:54:13,640
I want to check that out.

3315
02:54:13,720 --> 02:54:19,880
And then, um, there was also, what's the other one that they had for next week as well.

3316
02:54:20,520 --> 02:54:23,880
Uh, Blair, which is going to be free next week as well.

3317
02:54:25,160 --> 02:54:26,520
So check those out.

3318
02:54:27,320 --> 02:54:31,240
Um, as Joe and Matt says, I used to like butter fingers, but as I got older, I'm not a fan

3319
02:54:31,240 --> 02:54:31,880
of them.

3320
02:54:31,880 --> 02:54:35,080
I still like them, but what I really liked, I don't think they sell them anymore.

3321
02:54:35,080 --> 02:54:39,240
The butter fingers, BBs, the little, they were like tiny little, do you guys know what

3322
02:54:39,240 --> 02:54:39,740
I'm talking about?

3323
02:54:40,700 --> 02:54:45,580
They were like little, I think like a whopper, but it was filled with butter finger instead

3324
02:54:45,580 --> 02:54:46,080
the malts.

3325
02:54:46,780 --> 02:54:48,300
Yeah, I like those.

3326
02:54:49,180 --> 02:54:54,060
Um, Bobby Black Wolf says favorite quote from my 1982 history book.

3327
02:54:54,060 --> 02:54:55,020
Didn't read it.

3328
02:54:55,020 --> 02:54:59,420
Uh, no one special 77 says favorite vog host.

3329
02:55:00,620 --> 02:55:04,060
Oh, that's, that's a question that's asking for trouble.

3330
02:55:04,060 --> 02:55:11,740
Um, I'm going to say captain spike because I really want game buoy to come back regularly

3331
02:55:11,740 --> 02:55:12,540
and slide kick.

3332
02:55:12,540 --> 02:55:13,100
It's a tie.

3333
02:55:15,580 --> 02:55:17,980
Um, let's see.

3334
02:55:18,540 --> 02:55:19,100
That's it.

3335
02:55:19,100 --> 02:55:20,460
I don't think we have any other questions.

3336
02:55:21,260 --> 02:55:22,940
Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says grandpa.

3337
02:55:23,740 --> 02:55:25,660
Yeah, we want starboard power coupling back too.

3338
02:55:26,300 --> 02:55:27,420
So, all right.

3339
02:55:27,420 --> 02:55:28,620
Anyway, I guess that's it.

3340
02:55:28,620 --> 02:55:30,300
We're not really getting a lot of other questions.

3341
02:55:30,300 --> 02:55:32,060
We've run a pretty long show tonight.

3342
02:55:32,060 --> 02:55:35,020
We've had a very busy show, lots of things to discuss, so I think we're good to start

3343
02:55:35,020 --> 02:55:35,900
to wrap up.

3344
02:55:35,900 --> 02:55:38,540
I want to thank you guys for coming out and supporting the show.

3345
02:55:38,540 --> 02:55:42,860
Uh, thank you so much for listening to orange launch radio and supporting us every week

3346
02:55:42,860 --> 02:55:43,820
the way you always do.

3347
02:55:44,460 --> 02:55:47,900
If you, uh, enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio, please tell a friend

3348
02:55:47,900 --> 02:55:49,340
or five about the show.

3349
02:55:49,340 --> 02:55:50,860
Um, spread the word.

3350
02:55:50,860 --> 02:55:54,860
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we can only put the voices that are here

3351
02:55:54,860 --> 02:55:56,620
on the air if they're here.

3352
02:55:56,620 --> 02:56:03,020
So, um, uh, tell a friend, uh, auto hosts on twitch go an awful long way, which by the

3353
02:56:03,020 --> 02:56:06,300
way, um, if you didn't know, if you're not listening live, if you're listening on the

3354
02:56:06,300 --> 02:56:11,580
podcast feed, uh, after we do the credits, we'll come back and acknowledge everybody

3355
02:56:11,580 --> 02:56:13,900
who did the donations and the following.

3356
02:56:13,900 --> 02:56:18,940
I have not been able to read hosts for the longest time because twitch got rid of that

3357
02:56:18,940 --> 02:56:19,580
feature.

3358
02:56:19,580 --> 02:56:20,300
Well, guess what?

3359
02:56:20,300 --> 02:56:23,660
Y'all twitch brought it back, but guess what?

3360
02:56:23,660 --> 02:56:32,300
What y'all you have to be logged in as the account and not one of the deputies essentially

3361
02:56:32,300 --> 02:56:33,740
in order to see the list.

3362
02:56:33,740 --> 02:56:37,820
So I'm logged in as Rob Roberts, my personal account, which is deputized to do whatever

3363
02:56:37,820 --> 02:56:40,940
I need to do on bog network except see the damn hosting list.

3364
02:56:40,940 --> 02:56:45,980
So I'm hoping we'll get that fixed unless, um, Bobby's going to copy paste for me.

3365
02:56:45,980 --> 02:56:49,260
I don't know, but in future weeks I will be able to read the hosts again.

3366
02:56:49,260 --> 02:56:53,660
So the hosting and even if it's an auto hosting, that stuff goes an awful long way.

3367
02:56:53,660 --> 02:56:54,220
So thank you.

3368
02:56:54,220 --> 02:56:54,620
Thank you.

3369
02:56:54,620 --> 02:56:56,620
Bobby says there's 30 hosts.

3370
02:56:57,260 --> 02:56:58,540
That's amazing.

3371
02:56:58,540 --> 02:56:59,660
Thanks you guys.

3372
02:56:59,660 --> 02:57:00,540
You guys rule.

3373
02:57:01,180 --> 02:57:03,580
That's, that's way more than we had in December.

3374
02:57:03,580 --> 02:57:05,500
It was like 11 when we first started.

3375
02:57:05,500 --> 02:57:05,980
That's great.

3376
02:57:05,980 --> 02:57:06,860
Thanks you guys.

3377
02:57:06,860 --> 02:57:08,540
So auto hosts going off a long way.

3378
02:57:08,540 --> 02:57:08,860
Thank you.

3379
02:57:08,860 --> 02:57:09,500
Thank you.

3380
02:57:09,500 --> 02:57:10,620
And then a five star review.

3381
02:57:10,620 --> 02:57:14,940
If you use iTunes or any place that accepts reviews, we really appreciate those as well.

3382
02:57:15,500 --> 02:57:16,300
Um, yeah.

3383
02:57:16,300 --> 02:57:16,780
Word of mouth.

3384
02:57:16,780 --> 02:57:17,740
That's what we got.

3385
02:57:17,740 --> 02:57:22,220
So let's get to final thoughts, uh, and then wrap it all up.

3386
02:57:22,220 --> 02:57:23,580
So I guess Loki will start with you.

3387
02:57:23,580 --> 02:57:24,540
What's your final thought tonight?

3388
02:57:25,580 --> 02:57:31,500
Final thought is I hope I get this, uh, code bit that I'm working on to actually work correctly.

3389
02:57:31,500 --> 02:57:34,620
It's it really should be much simpler than what I'm doing.

3390
02:57:34,620 --> 02:57:39,500
There should be no reason why it's not working, but of course it's not working for reasons.

3391
02:57:40,780 --> 02:57:41,180
All right.

3392
02:57:42,140 --> 02:57:47,420
And, uh, my final thought tonight is vote, vote, vote, vote, vote, vote.

3393
02:57:47,420 --> 02:57:48,860
And, um, I'm excited.

3394
02:57:48,860 --> 02:57:52,620
I'm glad to hear there's many of you out there who have also been shy to play among us.

3395
02:57:52,620 --> 02:57:55,740
So I'm looking forward to our first VOG among us night.

3396
02:57:55,740 --> 02:57:56,780
I think there'll be a lot of fun.

3397
02:57:56,780 --> 02:57:58,700
I don't know when it will be, but I'm I'm we'll work on that.

3398
02:57:58,700 --> 02:57:59,260
So cool.

3399
02:57:59,820 --> 02:58:01,100
Um, that's it.

3400
02:58:01,100 --> 02:58:03,660
We're going to wrap up and, uh, roll the credits.

3401
02:58:03,660 --> 02:58:06,460
Thanks you guys for being here and checking out the show with this week.

3402
02:58:06,460 --> 02:58:07,900
Have a happy Halloween.

3403
02:58:07,900 --> 02:58:09,660
Have a safe Halloween.

3404
02:58:09,660 --> 02:58:11,500
Please remember COVID-19.

3405
02:58:11,500 --> 02:58:13,420
We just like Shane was on at the beginning of the show.

3406
02:58:13,420 --> 02:58:15,260
Thank you, Shane, for being here at the start of the show.

3407
02:58:15,260 --> 02:58:20,940
Even though he has COVID he came here on the show virtually, of course, uh, tonight to talk to us.

3408
02:58:20,940 --> 02:58:24,380
Um, and I hope that also kind of brings it home.

3409
02:58:24,380 --> 02:58:26,140
Like COVID is real.

3410
02:58:26,140 --> 02:58:32,220
It's out there and thank heavens, uh, Shane is, is relatively healthy through it.

3411
02:58:32,220 --> 02:58:35,660
And, uh, not, uh, one of the more serious cases.

3412
02:58:35,660 --> 02:58:41,020
Um, so I say that all because have a happy Halloween, but don't, don't be reckless.

3413
02:58:41,660 --> 02:58:46,140
Science does not care about your opinions, uh, political or otherwise.

3414
02:58:46,140 --> 02:58:49,180
So just because you wish COVID away isn't going to make it the case.

3415
02:58:49,180 --> 02:58:51,500
Uh, so please keep that in mind.

3416
02:58:51,500 --> 02:58:55,340
I'm not saying don't like leave your house, but just please take precautions.

3417
02:58:55,340 --> 02:58:55,820
Okay.

3418
02:58:55,820 --> 02:58:56,540
Take precautions.

3419
02:58:56,540 --> 02:58:56,940
Thank you.

3420
02:58:56,940 --> 02:58:57,420
Oh my God.

3421
02:58:57,420 --> 02:58:59,500

3422
02:58:59,500 --> 02:59:00,140
That's amazing.

3423
02:59:00,140 --> 02:59:00,860

02:59:00,860 --> 02:59:01,260
